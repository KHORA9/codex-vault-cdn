I was nominated by the Republican Convention, and Thomas\r\nthen became the candidate of the \"People's Party,\" and at the election\r\nhe was supported by the Democrats.  His course in the Thirty-seventh\r\nCongress on the various projects for compromise had alienated many\r\nRepublicans, and it had brought to him the support of many Democrats.\r\nMy active radicalism had alienated the conservative Republicans.  As a\r\nconsequence, my majority reached only about 1,400 while in the\r\nsubsequent elections, 1864-'66-'68 the majorities ranged from five to\r\nseven thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the new members who were elected to the Thirty-eighth Congress\r\nand who attained distinction subsequently, were Garfield, Blaine and\r\nAllison.  Wilson, of Iowa, had been in the Thirty-seventh Congress and\r\nHenry Winter Davis had been a member at an earlier period.  Mr.\r\nConkling was a member of the Thirty-seventh Congress, but he was\r\ndefeated by his townsman Francis Kernan under the influence of the\r\nreactionary wave which moved over the North in 1862.  At that time Mr.\r\nLincoln had lost ground with the people.  The war had not been\r\nprosecuted successfully, the expenses were enormous, taxes were heavy,\r\nmultitudes of families were in grief, and the prospects of peace\r\nthrough victory were very dim.  The Democrats in the House became\r\nconfident and aggressive.\r\n\r\nAlexander Long, of Ohio, made a speech so tainted with sympathy for\r\nthe rebels that Speaker Colfax came down from the chair and moved a\r\nresolution of censure.  Harris, of Maryland, in the debate upon the\r\nresolution, made a speech much more offensive than that of Long.  As a\r\nconsequence, the censure was applied to both gentlemen and as a further\r\nconsequence, the friends of the South became more guarded in\r\nexpressions of sympathy.  It is true also, that there were many\r\nDemocrats who did not sympathize with Harris, Long, and Pendleton.\r\nVoorhees of Indiana was also an active sympathizer with the South.  I\r\nrecollect that in the Thirty-eighth or Thirty-ninth Congress he made a\r\nviolent attack upon Mr. Lincoln, and the Republican Party.  The House\r\nwas in committee, and I was in the chair.  Consequently I listened\r\nattentively to the speech.  It was carefully prepared and modeled\r\napparently upon Junius and Burke--a model which time has destroyed.\r\n\r\nOf the members of the House during the war period, Henry Winter Davis\r\nwas the most accomplished speaker.  Mr. Davis' head was a study.  In\r\nfront it was not only intellectual, it was classical--a model for an\r\nartist.  The back of his head was that of a prize fighter, and he\r\ncombined the scholar and gentleman with the pugilist.  His courage was\r\nconstitutional and he was ready to make good his position whether by\r\nargument or by blows.  His speeches in the delivery were very\r\nattractive.  His best speech, as I recall his efforts, was a speech in\r\ndefense of Admiral Dupont.  That speech involved an attack upon the\r\nNavy Department.  Alexander H. Rice, of Massachusetts, was the chairman\r\nof the Naval Committee.  He appeared for the Navy Department in an able\r\ndefence.  Mr. Rice's abilities were not of the highest order, but his\r\nstyle was polished, and he was thoroughly equipped for the defence.  He\r\nhad the Navy Department behind him, and a department usually has a\r\nplausible reason or excuse for anything that it does.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of Mr. Davis' style as a writer and his quality as an\r\norator may be gained from a speech entitled:--\"Reasons for Refusing to\r\nPart Company with the South,\" which he delivered in February, 1861,\r\nand in which he set forth the condition of the country as it then\r\nappeared to him.  These extracts give some support to the opinion\r\nentertained by many that Mr. Davis was the leading political orator\r\nof the Civil War period:\r\n\r\n\"We are at the end of the insane revel of partisan license, which, for\r\nthirty years, has, in the United States, worn the mask of government.\r\nWe are about to close the masquerade by the dance of death.  The\r\nnations of the world look anxiously to see if the people, ere they\r\ntread that measure, will come to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Yet in the early youth of our national life we are already exhausted\r\nby premature excesses.  The corruption of our political maxims has\r\nrelaxed the tone of public morals and degraded the public authorities\r\nfrom terror to the accomplices of evil-doers.  Platforms for fools--\r\nplunder for thieves--offices for service--power for ambition--unity in\r\nthese essentials--diversity in the immaterial matters of policy and\r\nlegislation--charity for every frailty--the voice of the people is the\r\nvoice of God--these maxims have sunk into the public mind; have\r\npresided at the administration of public affairs, have almost effaced\r\nthe very idea of public duty.  The Government under their disastrous\r\ninfluence has gradually ceased to fertilize the fields of domestic and\r\nuseful legislation, and pours itself, like an impetuous torrent, along\r\nthe barren ravine of party and sectional strife.  It has been shorn of\r\nevery prerogative that wore the austere aspect of authority and power.\r\n\r\n\"The consequence of this demoralization is that States, without regard\r\nto the Federal Government, assume to stand face to face and wage their\r\nown quarrels, to adjust their own difficulties, to impute to each\r\nother every wrong, to insist that individual States shall remedy every\r\ngrievance, and they denounce failure to do so as cause of civil war\r\nbetween States; and as if the Constitution were silent and dead and\r\nthe power of the Union utterly inadequate to keep the peace between\r\nthem, unconstitutional commissioners flit from State to State, or\r\nassemble at the national capital to counsel peace or instigate war.\r\nSir, these are the causes which lie at the bottom of the present\r\ndangers.  These causes which have rendered them possible and made them\r\nserious, must be removed before they can ever be permanently cured.\r\nThey shake the fabric of our National Government.  It is to this\r\nfearful demoralization of the Government and the people that we must\r\nascribe the disastrous defections which now perplex us with the fear of\r\nchange in all that constituted our greatness.  The operation of the\r\nGovernment has been withdrawn from the great public interests, in order\r\nthat competing parties might not be embarrassed in the struggle for\r\npower by diversities of opinion upon questions of policy; and the\r\npublic mind, in that struggle, has been exclusively turned on the\r\nslavery question, which no interest required to be touched by any\r\ndepartment of this Government.  On that subject there are widely\r\nmarked diversities of opinion and interest in the different portions of\r\nthe Confederacy, with few mediating influences to soften the\r\ncollision.  In the struggle for party power, the two great regions of\r\nthe country have been brought face to face upon the most dangerous of\r\nall subjects of agitation.  The authority of the Government was relaxed\r\njust when its power was about to be assailed; and the people,\r\nemancipated from every control and their passions inflamed by the\r\nfierce struggle for the Presidency, were the easy prey of revolutionary\r\naudacity.\r\n\r\n\"Within two months after a formal, peaceful, regular election of the\r\nchief magistrate of the United States, in which the whole body of the\r\npeople of every State competed with zeal for the prize, without any new\r\nevent intervening, without any new grievances alleged, without any new\r\nmeasures having been made, we have seen, in the short course of one\r\nmonth, a small proportion of the population of six States transcend the\r\nbounds at a single leap at once of the State and the national\r\nconstitutions; usurp the extraordinary prerogative of repealing the\r\nsupreme law of the land; exclude the great mass of their fellow-\r\ncitizens from the protection of the Constitution; declare themselves\r\nemancipated from the obligations which the Constitution pronounces to\r\nbe supreme over them and over their laws; arrogate to themselves all\r\nthe prerogatives of independent power; rescind the acts of cession of\r\nthe public property; occupy the public offices; seize the fortresses\r\nof the United States confided to the faith of the people among whom\r\nthey were placed; embezzle the public arms concentrated there for the\r\ndefence of the United States; array thousands of men in arms against\r\nthe United States; and actually wage war on the Union by besieging\r\ntwo of their fortresses and firing on a vessel bearing, under the flag\r\nof the United States, reinforcements and provisions for one of them.\r\nThe very boundaries of right and wrong seem obliterated when we see a\r\nCabinet minister engaged for months in deliberately changing the\r\ndistribution of public arms to places in the hands of those about to\r\nresist our public authority, so as to place within their grasp means\r\nof waging war against the United States greater than they ever used\r\nagainst a foreign foe; and another Cabinet minister, still holding his\r\ncommission under the authority of the United States, still a\r\nconfidential adviser of the President, and bound by his oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, himself a commissioner\r\nfrom his own State to another of the United States for the purpose of\r\norganizing and extending another part of the same great scheme of\r\nrebellion; and the doom of the Republic seems sealed when the\r\nPresident, surrounded by such ministers, permits, without rebuke, the\r\nGovernment to be betrayed, neglects the solemn warning of the first\r\nsolider of the age, till almost every fort is a prey to domestic\r\ntreason, and accepts assurances of peace in his time at the expense of\r\nleaving the national honor unguarded.  His message gives aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemies of the Union, by avowing his inability to\r\nmaintain its integrity; and, paralyzed and stupefied, he stands amid\r\nthe crash of the falling Republic, still muttering, 'Not in my time,\r\nnot in my time; after me the deluge!'\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Colfax's election as speaker of the Thirty-eighth\r\nCongress, I met him in a restaurant.  He expressed surprise that he had\r\nnot heard from me in regard to a place upon a committee.  I said that\r\nthe subject did not occupy my thoughts--that I had work enough whether\r\nI was upon a committee or not.  He expressed himself as disturbed by\r\nthe fact that he could not give me as good a place as he wished to\r\ngive me.  I tried to relieve his mind upon that point.  In all my\r\nlegislative experience I never made any suggestion as to committee\r\nwork.  Mr. Colfax placed me upon the Judiciary Committee, which, in the\r\nend, was the best place to which I could have been assigned.\r\n\r\nMr. Colfax was made of consequence in the country by the newspapers,\r\nand he was ruined by his timidity.  If he had admitted that he was an\r\nowner of stock in the Credit Mobilier Company, not much could have\r\nbeen made against him.  His denials and explanations, which were either\r\nfalse or disingenuous, and his final admission of a fact which implied\r\nthat he had been in the receipt of a quarterly payment from a post-\r\noffice contractor, completed his ruin.  There was a time when the\r\ncountry over-estimated his ability.  He was a genial, kindly man, with\r\nsocial qualities and an abundance of information in reference to men\r\nin the United States and to recent and passing politics.  He had\r\nnewspaper knowledge and aptitude for gathering what may be called\r\ninformation as distinguished from learning.  He was a victim to two\r\npassions or purposes in life, that are in a degree inconsistent--public\r\nlife and money-making.  Instances there have been of success, but I\r\nhave never known a case where a public man has not suffered in\r\nreputation by the knowledge that he had accumulated a fortune while he\r\nwas engaged in the public service.  As a speaker of the House, Colfax\r\nwas agreeable and popular, but he lacked in discipline.  His rule was\r\nlax, and there can be no doubt that from the commencement of his\r\nadministration there had been a decline in what may be termed the\r\nmorale of the House.  Something of its reputation for dignity and\r\ndecorum had been lost.\r\n\r\nA young man from New York, Mr. Chanler, made a speech in the Thirty-\r\neighth or Thirty-ninth Congress, which seemed to favor the\r\nConfederacy.  This phase of his speech was due to the fact that he\r\nwas a transcendental State Rights advocate.  He did not believe in\r\nsecession, as a wise and proper policy, but he did believe in the\r\nright of a State to consult itself as to its continuance in the Union.\r\nChanler was not a strong man and he owed his election, probably, to his\r\nconnection with the Astor family.  He failed to make the political\r\ndistinction clear to the mind of the House and he was followed by\r\nGeneral Schenck in a severe speech.  Chanler explained and asserted\r\nthat he was not secessionist--that he was for the Union--that he had\r\nserved with the New York Seventh--and that he had made a tender to\r\nGeneral Dix of service on his staff, but that he had not received a\r\nreply from General Dix.\r\n\r\nThereupon S. S. Cox, who then represented a district in Ohio, made a\r\njocose reply to Schenck and a like defence of Chanler and ended with\r\nthe remark that he hoped his \"colleague regretted having been guilty\r\nof a groundless attack upon a solider of the Republic.\"  I went over to\r\nCox to congratulate him upon his defence of Chanler, and in reply Cox\r\nsaid:  \"The funniest part of it is that Chanler took it all in earnest\r\nand came to my seat and thanked me for my speech.\"\r\n\r\nCox had no malice in his nature and there was always a doubt whether he\r\nhad any sincerity in his politics.  He had no sympathy with the\r\nrebellion, and, generally, he voted appropriations for the army and\r\nthe navy.  He was sincere in his personal friendships, and his\r\nfriendships were not upon party lines.  In his political action he\r\nseemed more anxious to annoy his opponents than to extinguish them.\r\nHis speeches were short, pointed, and entertaining.  He was a favorite\r\nwith the House, but his influence upon its action was very slight.\r\nThose who acquire and retain power are the earnest and persistent men.\r\nWhen Cox had made his speech and expended his jokes he was content.\r\nThe fate of a measure did not much disturb or even concern him.\r\n\r\nCox was party to an affair in the House which illustrated the\r\ncharacteristics of Thaddeus Stevens, or \"Old Thad,\" as he was called.\r\nLate in the war, or soon after its close, Mr. Stevens introduced a\r\nbill to appropriate $800,000 to reimburse the State of Pennsylvania for\r\nexpenses incurred in repelling invasions and suppressing insurrections.\r\nThe bill was referred to the Committee on Appropriations, of which\r\nStevens was chairman.  Without much delay and before the holidays,\r\nStevens reported the bill.  There was some debate, in which my\r\ncolleague, Mr. Dawes, took part against the bill.  Finally the House\r\npostponed the bill till after the holidays.  During the recess I\r\nexamined the question by making inquiries at the War and Treasury\r\ndepartments, where I found that authority existed for reimbursing\r\nStates for all expenditures actually made and for the payment of all\r\ntroops that had been mustered into the service.  Thus the real purpose\r\nof the bill was apparent.  During the Antietam and Gettysburg campaigns\r\nbodies of troops had been organized for defence and expenses had been\r\nincurred by towns and counties, but no actual service had been\r\nperformed.  It was intended by the appropriation to provide for the\r\npayment of these expenses.  I prepared a brief and gave it to Mr.\r\nDawes, who used it in the debate.  When it became apparent that the\r\nbill would be lost, Cox rose and moved to insert after the word\r\nPennsylvania, the words Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nKentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and the Territory of New Mexico.\r\nAlso to strike out $800,000 and insert ten million dollars.  These\r\namendments brought to the support of the measure the members from all\r\nthose States, and the bill was passed.  The Senate never acted upon\r\nit.  I was indignant at the action of the House, and I said to Stevens,\r\nwhose seat was near to mine:  _\"This is the most outrageous thing that\r\nI have seen on the floor of the House.\"_  Stevens doubled his fist but\r\nnot in anger, shook it in my face and said:  \"You rascal, if you had\r\nallowed me to have my rights I should not have been compelled to make\r\na corrupt bargain in order to get them.\"   Thus he admitted his\r\narrangement with Cox and the character of it, and laid the\r\nresponsibility upon me.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was a tyrant in his rule as leader of the House.  He was at\r\nonce able, bold and unscrupulous.  He was an anti-slavery man, a friend\r\nto temperance and an earnest supporter of the public school system, and\r\nhe would not have hesitated to promote those objects by arrangements\r\nwith friends or enemies.  He was unselfish in personal matters, but his\r\npublic policy regarded the State of Pennsylvania, and the Republican\r\nParty.  The more experienced members of the House avoided controversy\r\nwith Stevens.  First and last many a new member was extinguished by his\r\nsarcastic thrusts.  As for himself no one could terrorize him.  I\r\nrecall an occasion near the close of a session, when, as it was\r\nimportant to get a bill out of the Committee of the Whole, he remained\r\nupon his feet or upon his one foot and assailed every member who\r\nproposed an amendment.  Sometimes his remarks were personal and\r\nsometimes they were aimed at the member's State.  In a few minutes he\r\ncowed the House, and secured the adoption of his motion for the\r\ncommittee to rise and report the bill to the House.\r\n\r\nHe must have been a very good lawyer.  The impeachment article which\r\nreceived the best support was from his pen.  He possessed wit,\r\nsarcasm and irony in every form.  In public all these weapons were\r\npoisoned, but in private he was usually genial.  On one occasion\r\nJudge Olin of New York was speaking and in his excitement he walked\r\ndown and up the aisle passing Stevens' seat.  At length Stevens said:\r\n\"Olin, do you expect to get mileage for this speech?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the controversy with Andrew Johnson, Thayer, of Pennsylvania,\r\nbecame excited upon a matter of no consequence, denounced the report of\r\na committee, and in the course of his remarks said:  \"They ask us to\r\ngo it blind.\"  Judge Hale, of New York, with an innocent expression,\r\nsaid he would like to have the gentleman from Pennsylvania inform the\r\nHouse as to the meaning of the phrase \"go it blind.\"  Stevens said at\r\nonce:  \"It means following Raymond.\"  The pertinency of the hit was in\r\nthe circumstance that Raymond was supporting Johnson, and that Hale was\r\nfollowing Raymond, not from conviction but for the reason that they\r\nhad been classmates in college.\r\n\r\nRobert S. Hale was a man of large ability and a successful lawyer.\r\nDuring his term in Congress he was a prominent candidate for a seat\r\nupon the bench of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.  At\r\na critical moment he appeared in the House in the role of a reformer\r\nand proceeded to arraign members for their action in regard to the\r\nmeasure known as the \"salary grab.\"  The debate showed that Hale was\r\ninvolved in the business to such an extent that he lost his standing\r\nin the House and imperiled his chance of obtaining a seat upon the\r\nbench of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nThe bill for the increase of the salaries of public officers was a\r\nproper bill with the single exception that it should have been\r\nprospective as to the members of Congress.  It added $2,500 to the\r\nannual salary of the Congressman or $5,000 for a term.  The temptation\r\nto give the benefit of the increase to the members of the then\r\nexisting House was too strong for their judgment and virtue.  When,\r\nhowever, the indignation of the people was manifested, more than a\r\nmajority of the members of each House sought refuge in a variety of\r\nsubterfuges.  Some neglected to collect the increase, others who had\r\nreceived the added sum, returned it to the Treasury upon a variety of\r\npretexts.  Some endowed schools or libraries, and a minority received\r\nwhat the laws allowed them and upon an assertion of their right to\r\nreceive it.  Outside of the criminal classes there has but seldom been\r\na more melancholy exhibition of the weakness of human nature.  The\r\nmembers seemed not to realize that the wrong was in the votes for\r\nwhich those members were alone responsible who had sustained the bill,\r\nand that the acceptance of the salary which the law allowed was not\r\nonly a right but a duty.  At the end those members who took the\r\nsalary and defended their acts enjoyed the larger share of public\r\nrespect.  Indeed, not one of the shufflers gained anything by the\r\ncourse that he had pursued.  The public reasoned, and reasoned justly,\r\nthat they would have kept the money if they had dared to do so.\r\n\r\nSimilar conduct ruined many of the members of Congress who were\r\nbeneficiaries of the Credit Mobilier scheme.  Mr. Samuel Hooper was a\r\nlarge holder of the stock, but being a man of fortune the public\r\naccepted that fact as a defence against the suggestion that the stock\r\nhad been placed in his hands for the purpose of influencing his\r\naction as a member of Congress.  With others the case was different.\r\nMany were poor men.  They had paid no money for the stock.  Mr. Ames\r\nmade the subscriptions, carried the stocks, and turned over the profits\r\nto those who had paid nothing and risked nothing.  When the\r\ninvestigation was threatened, many of those who were involved ran to\r\nshelter under a variety of excuses and some of them hoped to escape by\r\nthe aid of falsehood which ripened into perjury when the investigation\r\nwas made.  A few admitted ownership and asserted their right to\r\nownership.  Those men escaped with but little loss of prestige.  Of the\r\nothers, some retained their hold upon public office and some were\r\nadvanced to higher places, but they carried always the smell of the\r\nsmoke of corruption upon their garments.\r\n\r\nJudge Hale defended Mr. Colfax, but at the end his condition was worse\r\nthan at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is something of error in our public policy.  With a few\r\nexceptions, the salaries of public officers are too low--in many cases\r\nthey are meager.  This fact furnishes a pretext for efforts to make\r\nmoney while in the public service.  All these efforts are adverse to\r\nthe public interests and often the proceedings are tainted with\r\ncorruption.  A member of Congress ought to receive $7,500 and a\r\nCabinet officer cannot live in a manner corresponding to his station\r\nupon less than $15,000.  Adequate salaries would not prevent\r\nspeculation on the part of public officers, but they could not offer\r\nas an excuse for their acts the meager salaries allowed by the\r\ngovernment.  From the \"salary grab\" bill there were two good results.\r\nThe President's salary was increased to $50,000 and the justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court received $10,000 instead of $6,000 per annum.  It has\r\nnot been any part of my purpose in what I have said in favor of an\r\nincrease of salaries to furnish means for campaign expenses by\r\ncandidates either before or after nominations have been made.\r\n\r\nIf the statements are trustworthy that have been made publicly in\r\nrecent years the conclusion cannot be avoided that money is used\r\nin elections for corrupt purposes--sometimes to secure nominations\r\nand sometimes to secure elections, when nominations have been made.\r\nThere are proper uses for money in political contests, but candidates\r\nshould not be required to make contributions in return for support.\r\nIf the statements now made frequently and boldly, are truthful\r\nstatements, then we are moving towards a condition of affairs when the\r\noffices of government will be divided between rich men and men who\r\nseek office for the purpose of becoming rich.  A general condition\r\ncannot be proved by the experiences of individuals, but the\r\nexperiences of individuals may indicate a general condition.  I cannot\r\ndoubt that an unwholesome change in the use of money in elections has\r\ntaken place in the last fifty years.  A gentleman now living (1901),\r\nwho was a member of the National Committee of the Democratic Party in\r\nthe year 1856 is my authority for the statement that the total sum of\r\nmoney at the command of the committee in the campaign for Mr.\r\nBuchanan was less than twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nI mention my own experience and in the belief that it was not\r\nexceptional.  From 1840 to 1850 I was the candidate of the Democratic\r\nParty of Groton for representative of the town in the general court.\r\nThe party in the town met its moderate expenses by voluntary\r\ncontributions.  I contributed with others, but never upon the ground\r\nthat I was a candidate.  We paid our local expenses.  We paid nothing\r\nfor expenses elsewhere, and we did not receive anything from outside\r\nsources.  In 1844-'46 and 1848 I was the candidate of the Democratic\r\nParty for the National House of Representatives.  I canvassed the\r\ndistrict at my own charge.  I did not make any contribution to any one\r\nfor any purpose, and I did not receive financial aid from any source.\r\nThe subject was never mentioned to me or by me in conversation or\r\ncorrespondence with any one.  Again, I may say the subject was not\r\nmentioned in my canvass for the office of Governor in the years 1849-\r\n1850 and 1851.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 I became the candidate of the Republican Party for a seat in\r\nCongress.  After my nomination the District Committee asked me for a\r\ncontribution of one hundred dollars.  I met their request.  The request\r\nwas repeated and answered in 1864, 1866 and 1868.  On one occasion I\r\nreceived a return of forty-two dollars with a statement that the full\r\namount of my contribution had not been expended.\r\n\r\nWhile General Butler was in the army, Mr. James Brooks, a member from\r\nthe city of New York, charged him, in an elaborate speech, with having\r\ntaken about fifty thousand dollars from a bank in New Orleans, and\r\nappropriated the same to his own use.  General Butler was then at\r\nWillard's Hotel.  That evening I called upon Butler, and said to him\r\nthat if he had any answer to the charge, I would reply the next day.\r\nI had secured the floor through Mr. Stevens, who moved the adjournment\r\nupon a private understanding that he would yield to me in case I\r\nwished to reply.  As Butler lived in my district and as I was ignorant\r\nof the facts, I avoided taking the floor lest an expectation should be\r\ncreated which I could not meet.  However, I found Butler entirely\r\nprepared for the contest.  From his letter books he read to me the\r\ncorrespondence with the Treasury Department, from which it appeared\r\nthat the money had been turned over to the department, for which\r\nButler had the proper receipts.  The money had been seized upon the\r\nground that it was the property of the Confederacy and was in the bank\r\nawaiting an opportunity to be transferred.  The morning following, I\r\ncalled upon Butler and obtained copies of the correspondence that had\r\nbeen prepared the preceding night.  I rode to the Capitol with Butler\r\nand on the way we prepared the letters in chronological order.  Having\r\nobtained the floor through Mr. Stevens I made the answer which\r\nconsisted chiefly of the letters.  It was so conclusive that the\r\nsubject was never again mentioned in the House of Representatives.  On\r\nthat occasion Butler's habit of making and keeping a full record of his\r\ndoings served to release him from very serious charges, and so speedily\r\nthat the charges did not obtain a lodgment in the public mind.\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion Brooks made an attack upon Secretary Chase and\r\ncharged various offences upon S. M. Clark, then the chief of the\r\nBureau of Engraving and Printing.  Some of the charges were personal,\r\nand some of them official.  I called upon the Secretary at his house,\r\nas I was on my way home from the Capitol, and gave him a statement of\r\nthe charges made by Brooks.  He seemed ignorant of the whole matter,\r\nand upon my suggestion that he should ask Clark for his explanation or\r\ndefence he hesitated, and then asked me to call upon Clark for his\r\nanswer.  This I declined and there the matter ended.  There never was\r\nany reply to Brooks.  In the end it may have been as well, for the\r\ncharges are forgotten, and they are not likely to be brought out of the\r\nmusty volumes of debates.  Mr. Chase's lack of resolution gave me an\r\nunfavorable impression of his ability for administrative affairs.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Randall first entered Congress in 1862.  Mr. Randall's\r\nresources were limited.  He was not bred to any profession, and he was\r\nnot a man of learning in any direction.  I cannot imagine that he had\r\na taste for study at any kind of investigation aside from politics.\r\nBy long experience he became familiar with parliamentary proceedings,\r\nand from the same source he acquired a knowledge of the business of\r\nthe Government.  He had one essential quality of leadership--a strong\r\nwill.  Moreover, he was destitute, apparently, of moral perceptions in\r\npublic affairs.  Not that he was corrupt, but as between the Government\r\nand its citizens the demands of what is called justice seemed to have\r\nno effect upon him.  He did not hesitate to delay the payment of a just\r\nclaim in order that the appropriation might be kept within the limits\r\nthat he had fixed.  This, not on the ground that the claim ought not be\r\npaid, but for the reason that the payment at the time would disarrange\r\nthe balance sheet.  A striking instance of his policy was exhibited in\r\nhis treatment of the land-owners whose lands were condemned and taken\r\nfor the reservoir at the end of Seventh Street, Washington, D. C.  The\r\nvalues were fixed by a commission and by juries under the law, and when\r\nthe time for an appropriation came, Mr. Randall provided for fifty per\r\ncent. and carried the remainder over to the next year.  The claimants\r\nwere entitled to full payment, but one half was withheld for twelve\r\nmonths without interest and that while dead funds were lying in the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\nINCIDENTS IN THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nTHE PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nWhen the Proclamation of Emancipation, of January 1, 1863, was issued,\r\nthe closing sentence attracted universal attention, and in every part\r\nof the world encomiums were pronounced upon it.  The words are these:\r\n\"And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,\r\nwarranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the\r\nconsiderate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty\r\nGod.\"  Following the appearance of the Proclamation, and stimulated,\r\npossibly, by the reception given to the sentence quoted, there appeared\r\nclaimants for the verbal authorship of the passage, or for suggestions\r\nwhich led to its writing by Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nA claim for exact authorship was set up for Mr. Chase, and claims for\r\nsuggestions in the nature of exact authorship were made in behalf of\r\nMr. Seward and in behalf of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nThe sentence quoted was furnished by Mr. Chase, after a very material\r\nalteration by the President.  He introduced the words, _\"warranted by\r\nthe Constitution upon military necessity,\"_ in place of the phrase,\r\n_\"and of duty demanded by the circumstances of the country,\"_ as\r\nwritten by Mr. Chase.\r\n\r\nThe main credit for the introduction of the fortunate phrase is due to\r\nSecretary Chase.  President Lincoln placed the act upon a legal basis,\r\njustifying it in law and in history.  The sentence is what we might\r\nhave expected from the head and heart of the man who wrote the final\r\nsentence of the first inaugural address:  \"The mystic chords of\r\nmemory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every\r\nliving heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet\r\nswell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will\r\nbe, by the better angels of our nature.\"  Mr. Lincoln had genius for\r\nthe work of composition, and the poetic quality was strong and it was\r\noften exhibited in his speeches and writings.  The omission of the\r\nsentence in question would so mar the Proclamation that it would cease\r\nto represent Mr. Lincoln.  Thus he became under great obligations to\r\nMr. Chase.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the nature of Mr. Lincoln to close a state paper, which\r\nhe could not but have realized was to take a place by the side of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, with a bald statement that the freedmen\r\nwould be received \"into the armed service of the United States to\r\ngarrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man\r\nvessels of all sorts in said service.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, 1863, the ladies of Chicago made a request of\r\nMr. Lincoln for \"the original\" of his \"proclamation of freedom,\" the\r\nsame to be disposed of \"for the benefit of the soldiers.\"  The letter\r\nin their behalf was written by Mr. Arnold, who was then a member of\r\nCongress.  Improvidently, I think we may say, Mr. Lincoln yielded to\r\ntheir request for the original draft of the Proclamation to be sold\r\nfor the benefit of the fair.  Its transmission was accompanied by a\r\nletter, written by Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\"WASHINGTON,\r\n\"_October_ 26, 1863.\r\n\r\n_\"Ladies having in charge The North Western Fair for the Sanitary\r\n  Commission, Chicago, Ill._\r\n\r\n\"According to the request made in your behalf, the original draft of\r\nthe Emancipation Proclamation is herewith enclosed.  The formal words\r\nat the top and at the conclusion, except the signature, you perceive,\r\nare not in my handwriting.  They were written at the State Department,\r\nby whom I know not.  The printed part was cut from a copy of the\r\npreliminary Proclamation and pasted on merely to save writing.\r\n\r\n\"I have some desire to retain the paper, but if it shall contribute\r\nto the relief of the soldiers, that would be better.\r\n\r\n\"Your obt. servt.,\r\n\"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nIn technical strictness the original Proclamation was of the archives\r\nof the Department of State when the signature of the President and\r\nSecretary of State had been affixed thereto, and its transfer by Mr.\r\nLincoln was an act not within his competency as President, or as the\r\nauthor of the Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThis point, however, is wholly speculative, but the country and\r\nposterity will be interested in the fate of the original of a document\r\nwhich is as immortal as the Declaration of Independence.  The\r\nProclamation was sold to the Honorable Thomas B. Bryan of Chicago for\r\nthe sum of three thousand dollars and it was then presented by him to\r\nthe Soldiers' Home of Chicago, of which he was then President.  That\r\nposition he still retains.  The document was deposited in the rooms of\r\nthe Chicago Historical Society, where it was destroyed in the great\r\nfire of 1871.\r\n\r\nFortunately the managers of the fair had secured the preparation of\r\n_fac simile_ copies of the Proclamation.  These were sold in large\r\nnumbers, and thus many thousands of dollars were added to the receipts\r\nof the fair.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the Soldiers' Home were offered twenty-five thousand\r\ndollars for the original Proclamation.*  The offer came from a\r\nshowman who expected to reimburse himself by the exhibition of the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe original now on the files of the State Department is not in the\r\nhandwriting of Mr. Lincoln and it has therefore no value derived from\r\nMr. Lincoln's personality.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon this inquiry, which has resulted in the preparation\r\nof this paper, I was ignorant of the fact that the original\r\nProclamation had been destroyed, and it was my purpose to secure its\r\nreturn to the archives of the Department of State.  That is now\r\nimpossible.  Its destruction has given value to the _fac simile_\r\ncopies.  Many thousands of them are in the possession of citizens of\r\nthe United States, and they will be preserved and transmitted as\r\nsouvenirs of the greatest act of the most illustrious American of this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn of 1864 a meeting was held in Faneuil Hall in\r\nhonor of the capture of Atlanta by the army under General Sherman, and\r\nthe battle in Mobile Bay under the lead of Admiral Farragut.  Strange\r\nas the fact may now appear, those historical events were not accepted\r\nwith satisfaction by all the citizens of Boston.  The leading\r\nDemocratic papers gave that kind of advice that may be found, usually,\r\nin the columns of hostile journals, when passing events are unfriendly,\r\nor when there is an adverse trend of public opinion.  Hard words should\r\nnot be used and nothing should be said of a partisan character.  Such\r\nwas the advice, and a large body of men assembled who were opposed to\r\npartisan speeches.  They were known as the McClellan Club of the\r\nNorth End of Boston and they were sufficient in numbers, when standing,\r\nto fill the main floor in front of the rostrum, which at that time was\r\nnot provided with seats.  The meeting was called by Republicans and it\r\nwas conducted under the auspices of Republicans.  Governor Andrew was\r\nto preside and Governor Everett, with others, had been invited to\r\nspeak.  Governor Andrew was not blessed with a commanding voice and it\r\nwas drowned or smothered by the hisses, cheers and cat-call cries of\r\nthe hostile audience in front of him.  The efforts of the sympathetic\r\naudience in the galleries were of no avail.  Mr. Everett's letter was\r\nthen read, but not a sentence of it was understood by any person in the\r\nassembly.  Next came Mr. Sennott, an Irishman, a lawyer, and a man of\r\nlarge learning in knowledge and attainments not adapted to general use.\r\nHe had then but recently abandoned the Democratic Party, but there was\r\na stain upon his reputation, traceable to the fact that in the year\r\n1859 he had volunteered to aid in the legal defence of John Brown at\r\nHarper's Ferry.  The city of Boston could not have offered a person\r\nless acceptable to the crowd in front of the speaker.  Mr. Sennott's\r\nvoice was weak and of the art of using what power he possessed he had\r\nno knowledge.  His speech was not heard by anyone in the assembly.\r\nBy the arrangement I was to follow Mr. Sennott.  I had had some\r\nexperience with hostile audiences, and in the year 1862 I had been\r\ninterrupted in a country town of Massachusetts by stones thrown\r\nthrough the windows of a hall in which I was speaking upon the war and\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nAs I sat upon the platform I studied my audience and I resolved upon my\r\ncourse.  I had one fixed resolution--I should get a hearing or I should\r\nspend the night in the hall.  Something of the character of my\r\nreception and the results reached may be gained from the report of the\r\nBoston _Journal_, and I copy the report without alteration, premising\r\nhowever that some minutes passed before I secured a quiet hearing.\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON THE CHICAGO RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n_Fellow Citizens:_ It depends very much upon what we believe as to the\r\nfuture of this country and the rights of the people, whether we rejoice\r\nor mourn in consequence of the events in Mobile Bay and before Atlanta.\r\nIf it was true on the 30th day of last month that the people of this\r\ncountry ought to take immediate efforts for the cessation of\r\nhostilities, then, gentlemen, we have cause to mourn rather than to\r\nrejoice.  I understand that there were some people in this country,\r\nwho, before the 30th of August, since this was opened, had not, as an\r\naggregate body of men, expressed their opinions in reference to this\r\nwar, who then declared that it ought to cease.  (A voice--\"They're\r\nfew.\")  I observed in a newspaper published in this city two\r\nobservations within the last two days.  One was that they were afraid\r\nhard names would be used; and the other was that there was some\r\napprehension that this meeting to-night would have some political\r\naspect or influence.  (Voices--\"No!  No!\")  I thought it likely\r\nenough that it would (laughter and applause) because I observed in the\r\nnewspapers that it was called to express congratulations over the\r\nevents which had taken place in Mobile Bay and before Atlanta, and I\r\nthought that I had observed that those events had rather a political\r\neffect.  (Renewed laughter.)  Therefore I did not see exactly how it\r\nwas possible that men should assemble together to rejoice over events\r\nhaving a political aspect without the meeting and the rejoicing having\r\na political aspect also.  Well, now, gentlemen, I haven't come here\r\nwith any design that, so far as I am concerned, it shall have anything\r\nbut a political aspect.  (\"Good\" and applause.)  These times are too\r\nserious for the acceptance of any suggestion that hard names are not\r\nto be called if hard names are deserved.  (Voices--\"That is it!\")  The\r\nquestion is not whether the meeting shall have a political influence,\r\nbut whether it is necessary to the salvation of the country that it\r\nshall have a political influence.  (Applause.)  Well, gentlemen, I\r\nobserved while the person who last occupied the platform was speaking\r\ncertain indications, which I thought were a slight deviation from the\r\nmuch talked-of right of free speech.  (Laughter, and a voice--\"Hit 'em\r\nagain.\")  Now, then, I am going to read a resolution adopted at\r\nChicago.  I am going to make two propositions in reference to it.  I am\r\nthen going to ask whether this assembly assents to or rejects those\r\npropositions.  If there is any man in this assembly who denies or\r\ndoubts those propositions, if I have the consent of the honored\r\nchairman of this meeting to ten minutes of time in which I can engage\r\nthe ear of the assembly, I surrender it to that man, that he may have\r\nthe opportunity upon this platform to refute, if he can, the\r\npropositions which I lay down.  (Applause.)  Now the second resolution\r\nof this platform is in these words--\r\n\r\n(At this point there was considerable disturbance in the rear of the\r\nhall, created by one individual, and several voices cried out--\"Free\r\nspeech!\"  \"Out with him!\")\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell continued:  He will be more useful to the country if he\r\nremain here.  If he goes away there is no chance for his conversion to\r\nthe truth: if he remain here he may be saved.  (Laughter.)  \"The vilest\r\nsinner may return, While the lamp holds out to burn.\"  (Renewed laughter\r\nand applause.)  I hope gentlemen who favor free speech will listen\r\nattentively to this resolution:\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That this convention does explicitly declare as the sense\r\nof the American people, that after four years of failure to restore\r\nthe Union by the experiment of war, during which under pretence of\r\nmilitary necessity, or war power higher than the Constitution, the\r\nConstitution has been disregarded in every part and public liberty and\r\nprivate rights alike trodden down, and the material prosperity of the\r\ncountry essentially impaired, justice, humanity, liberty and the public\r\nwelfare demand that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of\r\nhostilities with a view to an ultimate convention of all the States, or\r\nother peaceable means, to the end that at the earliest practicable\r\nmoment peace may be restored on the basis of a Federal Union of the\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n(The resolution was greeted with a feeble clapping of hands, a slight\r\nattempt at cheers in the rear of the hall, and a storm of hisses.  Mr.\r\nBoutwell continued:)\r\n\r\nIf there are any gentlemen here who approve this resolution, I hope\r\nthey will have the opportunity to cheer.  (About half a dozen persons\r\ncommenced to cheer, but abandoned it on hearing their own voices,\r\nwhen a voice exclaiming \"These are the Copperheads,\" caused loud\r\nlaughter.  The speaker proceeded:)\r\n\r\nNow then, gentlemen, the two propositions I lay down are these, and if\r\nany one of those gentlemen who indulged in the luxury of a cheer just\r\nnow chooses to come upon this platform, I fulfill my pledge:  The first\r\nis that this resolution, so far as known, meets the approval of the\r\nrebels in arms against this government.  (Voices--\"That's so,\" and\r\ncheers.)  The second is that this resolution meets the approval of all\r\nthe men in the North who sympathize with the cause of this rebellion\r\nand desire its success.  (Repeated cheers and \"That's it.\")  Now, then,\r\nif there is any one who would deny the truth of these propositions, let\r\nhim, with the leave of the chair, take ten minutes upon this platform.\r\n(Some confusion ensued, several voices shouting \"Make room for George\r\nLunt,\" \"Where's Lunt?\" etc., etc., etc.  No one appearing, Mr. Boutwell\r\ncontinued:)  If there is nobody to refute these propositions, I take it\r\nfor granted that they meet the general assent of this vast assembly.\r\n(cries of \"Good\" and cheers); and, if so, isn't this the time, when a\r\ngreat convention professing to represent a portion of the American\r\npeople in time of war, not having spoken since hostilities commenced,\r\nframe a leading resolution so as to meet the assent and approval of\r\nthe enemies of the Republic--isn't this the time, when such things are\r\ndone, for men who have a faith in the country and a belief in its right\r\nto exist, to declare the reasons of that belief?  (Voices--\"Yes.\")  Now\r\nI propose to discuss that resolution in some degree.  First, it\r\nproposes a cessation of hostilities.  I have heard the word armistice\r\nmentioned to-night.  The declaration of that resolution is not for an\r\narmistice.  An armistice, according to its general acceptation and\r\nuse, implies a suspension of hostilities upon the expectation and\r\ncondition that they are to be resumed; and if hostilities are not to\r\nbe resumed then a cessation of hostilities is an abandonment of the\r\nGovernment.  It is treason.  (Voices--\"That's so,\" and loud and\r\ncontinued cheers.)  I declare here that the proposition for a\r\ncessation of hostilities is moral and political treason (voices--\r\n\"Good\"); and, further, every man who knowingly and after investigation,\r\nand upon his judgment favors a cessation of hostilities, is a traitor.\r\n(Loud cheers.)  The issue, gentlemen, is no longer upon the tented\r\nfield.  No danger there to the cause of the Union.  The soldiers are\r\ntrue to the flag and they will fight on and march on until the last\r\nrebel has fallen to the dust or laid down his arms.  The soldiers are\r\ntrue, but the cause of the Union is in peril at home (voices--\"That's\r\nwhere it is\"), where secret organizations are mustering their forces\r\nand gathering in material of war for which there can be no possible use\r\nexcept to revolutionize this country through the fearful experience of\r\ncivil war.  (A voice--\"Shame on them.\")  O how I long for some\r\nknowledge of the English language so that I may select a word or a\r\nphrase which shall fully express the enormity of this treason!  (Voices\r\n--\"Hang them.\"  \"String them up.\")\r\n\r\nThe rebels of the South have some cause.  They believe in the\r\ninstitution of slavery,--they have been educated under its influence.\r\nThey thought it in peril.  They made war with some pretence on their\r\npart for a reason for war, but what excuse, what palliation is there\r\nfor those men in the North, who, regardless of liberty, of justice, and\r\nof humanity, ally themselves, openly some and secretly others, with the\r\nenemies of the Republic?  Spare, spare, your anathemas, gentlemen.  Do\r\nnot longer employ the harsh language which you can command in\r\ndenunciation of Southern traitors.  They of the North who give aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemy deserve to monopolize in the application all the\r\nharsh words and phrases of the English language.  (Applause.)\r\nCessation of hostilities--what follows?  Dissolution of the Union\r\ninevitably.  Will not Jefferson Davis and his associates understand\r\nthat when we have ceased to make war, when our armies become\r\ndemoralized, public sentiment relaxed, when they have had opportunity\r\nto gather up the materials for prosecuting this contest, that we\r\ncannot renew the contest with any reasonable hope of success.\r\nTherefore, if you abandon this contest now, it is separation--that is\r\nwhat is meant, and nothing else can follow.  But suppose that what\r\nsome gentlemen desire could be accomplished,--a reconstruction of the\r\nUnion by diplomatic relations inaugurated between this Government and\r\nJefferson Davis'--suppose the South should return--what follows?  When\r\nyou have permitted Jefferson Davis and his associates to come back and\r\ntake their places in the government of this country, do you not see\r\nthat with the help of a small number of representatives from the North\r\nwhose services they are sure to command, they will assume the war debt\r\nof the South.  When you have assumed that debt, and taken the\r\nobligation to pay it, these men of the South will treat the obligation\r\nlightly, and upon the first pretext will renew secession and will\r\nmarch straight out of the Union, and you, with your embarrassed\r\nfinance, will find yourselves unable to institute military proceedings\r\nfor their subjugation.  Therefore I say that by the reconstruction\r\nsome men desire you render secession certain, bankruptcy throughout\r\nthe North certain.  The repudiation of the Public Debt is not a matter\r\nof expectation or fear, it is a matter of certainty, if you assent to\r\nany reconstruction of this Union through the instrumentality of\r\nJefferson Davis and his associates.  You must either drive them into\r\nexile or exterminate them.  Break down the military power of the\r\npeople, and exterminate or exile their leaders, and bring up men at\r\nthe South in favor of the Union--there is no other way of security to\r\nyourselves.  (Cheers.)  Now, then, are you prepared to cease\r\nhostilities with the expectation of negotiations with Jefferson Davis\r\nfor the dissolution of the Union or for its restoration? (Voices--\r\n\"No!\")  Either course is alike fatal to you, for the war must go on\r\nuntil peace is conquered.  (Loud cheers and voices--\"That's so.\")  On\r\nthe one side they offer you as negotiators Franklin Pierce, perhaps,\r\nand A. H. Stephens; on the other, possibly one of the Seymours, either\r\nof Connecticut or New York, Wise of Virginia, Vallandingham of Ohio,\r\nand Soule of Louisiana.  The only negotiators, gentlemen, to be\r\ntrusted as long as the war continued or there is a rebel in arms--the\r\nonly negotiators are Grant upon one line and Sherman upon the other.\r\n(Tremendous cheers.)\r\n\r\nA Voice--\"You have left out Mr. Harris of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell--\"According to the reports, etc., we have had from\r\nChicago, he conducts negotiations upon his own account.\"\r\n\r\nVoice--\"How are you, Mr. Harris?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell--\"What does the cessation of hostilities mean?  It means\r\nthat the blockade is to be removed, and the South be allowed to\r\nfurnish itself with materials and munitions of war.  What does that\r\nmean on the land?  What does it mean on the sea?  That you are to furl\r\nyour flag at Fortress Monroe on the Petersburg line; that you are to\r\nremove your gunboats from the Mississippi River; that you are to\r\nabandon Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip at its mouth; that you are to\r\nundo the work which the gallant Farragut has already done in Mobile\r\nBay, and so along the coast and upon the line from the Atlantic beyond\r\nthe Mississippi River.  You, people of the North, who have been\r\nvictorious upon the whole through three years of war--you are to\r\ndisgrace your ancestry--you are to render yourselves infamous in all\r\nfuture time, by furling your flag and submitting anew to rebel\r\nauthority upon this continent.  Are you prepared for it?  (Voices--\r\n\"No!\" \"never!\")  I ask these men here, who cheered the resolution\r\nadopted at Chicago, whether they, men of Massachusetts, and in Faneuil\r\nHall, will say, one of them, with his face to the patriots of the\r\nRevolution--will say that he asks for peace through any craven spirit\r\nthat is within him?  Is there a man among them all, from whatsoever\r\nquarter of this city, renowned in history--is there a man of them all\r\nwho will stand here and say he is for the cessation of hostilities?  If\r\nso, let him speak, and let him, if he dare, come upon this platform and\r\nface his patriotic fellow-citizens.  (A call was made for cheers for\r\nMcClellan in the rear of the hall, but nobody seemed disposed to\r\nrespond.  The speaker continued.)  I am willing a cheer should be given\r\nfor any man who has been in the service of the country, however little\r\nhe may have done.  Is there any man in Faneuil Hall for peace? (Voices\r\n--\"No!\")  I intended, so far as was in my power, to give to this\r\nmeeting a political aspect (voices--\"Good!\") in favor of the country\r\nand against traitors.  (Cheers.)  If there are no peace men in this\r\nassembly, then that object, as far as we are concerned, is\r\naccomplished.  (Prolonged cheering.)\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE AND THE CHIEF JUSTICESHIP\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Chief Justice Taney the general public favored the\r\nappointment of Mr. Chase as his successor.  In that view I concurred,\r\nbut I had heard Mr. Chase make so many unjust criticisms upon Mr.\r\nLincoln that I resolved to say nothing.  I was willing to have Mr.\r\nChase appointed, but I was not willing to ask the President to confer\r\nso great a place upon a man who had been so unjust to him.  When the\r\nnomination had been made, I said to Mr. Lincoln that I was very glad\r\nthat he had decided to appoint Mr. Chase.  He then said:  \"There are\r\nthree reasons in favor of his appointment, and one very strong reason\r\nagainst it.  First, he occupies the largest place in the public mind\r\nin connection with the office, then we wish for a Chief Justice who\r\nwill sustain what has been done in regard to emancipation and the legal\r\ntenders.  We cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should and he\r\nshould answer us, we should despise him for it.  Therefore we must take\r\na man whose opinions are known.  But there is one very strong reason\r\nagainst his appointment.  He is a candidate for the Presidency, and if\r\nhe does not give up that idea it will be very bad for him and very bad\r\nfor me.\"  At that time Mr. Lincoln had been re-elected to the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase continued to be a candidate for the Presidency.  He abandoned\r\nthe Republican Party in 1868 and as Chief Justice he abandoned his own\r\npolicy or the policy that he had adopted in regard to the legal tender\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Mr. Sumner, who was very earnest for Chase's\r\nappointment, gave strong pledges to Mr. Lincoln that Mr. Chase would\r\nabandon his ambition for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF STATES\r\n\r\nIn 1864 I introduced a series of resolutions in the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the form of a Declaration of Opinion in regard to\r\nthe legal status of the States in rebellion.  At that time the country\r\nand Congress had no doubt of our ability to crush the rebellion, and\r\nthe public mind was occupied with various theories of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions had been already adopted by the National Union League.\r\nI prepared them at the instance of Governor Claflin and their\r\nadoption by the League had made the policy known to a large body of\r\nactive Republicans.  I did not seek to secure their adoption by the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  The resolutions were in this form:\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That the Committee on the Rebellious States be instructed\r\nto consider and report upon the expediency of recommending to this\r\nHouse the adoption of the following\r\n\r\n_Declaration of Opinions:_\r\n\r\n\"In view of the present condition of the country, and especially in\r\nregard to the recent signal successes of the national arms promising\r\na speedy overthrow of the rebellion, this House makes the following\r\ndeclaration of opinion concerning the institution of slavery in the\r\nStates and parts of States engaged in the rebellion, and embraced in\r\nthe proclamation of emancipation issued by the President on the first\r\nday of January, A. D. 1863: and also concerning the relations now\r\nsubsisting between the people of such States and parts of States on\r\nthe one side, and the American Union on the other.\r\n\r\n_\"It is therefore declared_ (as the opinion of the House of\r\nRepresentatives), that the institution of slavery was the cause of the\r\npresent rebellion, and that the destruction of slavery in the\r\nrebellious States is an efficient means of weakening the power of the\r\nrebels; that the President's proclamation whereby all persons\r\nheretofore held as slaves in such States and parts of States have been\r\ndeclared free, has had the effect to increase the power of the Union,\r\nand to diminish the power of its enemies; that the freedom of such\r\npersons was desirable and just in itself, and an efficient means by\r\nwhich the Government was to be maintained, and its authority re-\r\nestablished in all the territory and over all the people within the\r\nlegal jurisdiction of the United States; that it is the duty of the\r\nGovernment and of loyal men everywhere to do what may be practicable\r\nfor the enforcement of the proclamation, in order to secure in fact,\r\nas well as by the forms of law, the extinction of slavery in such\r\nStates and parts of States; and, finally, that it is the paramount\r\nduty of the Government and of all loyal men to labor for the\r\nrestoration of the American Union upon the basis of freedom.\r\n\r\n_\"And this House does further declare,_ That a State can exist or cease\r\nto exist only by the will of the people within its limits, and that it\r\ncannot be created or destroyed by the external force or opinion of\r\nother States, or even by the judgment or action of the nation itself;\r\nthat a State, when created by the will of its people, can become a\r\nmember of the American Union only by its own organized action and the\r\nconcurrent action of the existing National Government, that, when a\r\nState has been admitted to the Union, no vote, resolution, ordinance,\r\nor proceeding on its part, however formal in character or vigorously\r\nsustained, can deprive the National Government of the legal\r\njurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory and people of such\r\nState which existed previous to the act of admission, or which were\r\nacquired thereby; that the effect of the so-called acts, resolutions\r\nand ordinances of secession adopted by the eleven States engaged in\r\nthe present rebellion is, and can only be, to destroy those political\r\norganizations as States, while the legal and constitutional\r\njurisdiction and authority of the National Government over the people\r\nand territory remain unimpaired; that these several communities can be\r\norganized into States only by the will of the loyal people, expressed\r\nfreely and in the absence of all coercion; that States so organized can\r\nbecome States of the American Union only when they shall have applied\r\nfor admission, and their admission shall have been authorized by the\r\nexisting National Government; that, when a people have organized a\r\nState upon basis of allegiance to the Union and applied for admission,\r\nthe character of the institutions of such proposed State may constitute\r\na sufficient justification for granting or rejecting such application;\r\nand, inasmuch as experience has shown that the existence of human\r\nslavery is incompatible with a republican form of government, in the\r\nseveral States or in the United States, and inconsistent with the\r\npeace, prosperity and unity of the nation, it is the duty of the people\r\nand of all men in authority, to resist the admission of slave States\r\nwherever organized within the jurisdiction of the National Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe logical consequence of these positions was that upon the conquest\r\nof the States engaged in the rebellion the National Government could\r\ngovern the people as seemed expedient and readmit them into the Union\r\nat such times and upon such terms as the Government should dictate.\r\nThey antagonized the doctrine then accepted by many Republicans--\r\n\"Once a State always a State\"--a doctrine that would have transferred\r\nthe government at once into the hands of the men who had been engaged\r\nin an effort to destroy it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was wiser in this respect.  His theory that the\r\nrebellious States should be reduced to a Territorial condition was in\r\nharmony with the views that were embodied in the resolutions.  At the\r\ntime, however, they did not receive the support of all the members of\r\nthe Republican Party.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens maintained the doctrine that the rebel States were\r\nconquered States and wholly subject to the power of the conqueror.\r\nIn his view their previous condition as States in the Union had no\r\nvalue.  But Mr. Stevens was never troubled by the absence of logic or\r\nargument.  In the case of the rebel States he intended to assert power\r\nenough to meet the exigency and he was free of all fear as to the\r\njudgement of posterity.  When he had formed a purpose he looked only\r\nto the end.  If he could command the adequate means he left all\r\nquestions of logic and ethics to other minds and to future times.\r\n\r\nOthers maintained that the theory that the States were in a Territorial\r\ncondition or that they had ceased to exist as States, was an admission\r\nof the doctrine of secession.  Mr. Lincoln in his last public address\r\ncut clear of all theories and resolved the situation into a simple\r\nstatement of a fact to which all were compelled to assent:  \"We all\r\nagree, that the seceded States so-called, are out of their proper\r\npractical relations with the Union.\"  On this basis Congress finally\r\nacted, but during the process and progress of reconstruction the\r\nmilitary authority was absolute, and local and individual powers were\r\ncompletely subordinated to the authority of the General Government.\r\n\r\nCOUNTING THE ELECTORAL VOTES\r\n\r\nIn 1865 and 1869, questions were raised when the electoral votes were\r\ncounted, that gave rise to debates in the House of Representatives and\r\non one occasion subsequently in the Senate.  In the House, Francis\r\nThomas of Maryland and Samuel Shellabarger of Ohio took part.  Both\r\nwere able men.  Thomas had the qualities of an orator but he spoke so\r\ninfrequently that his power was not generally appreciated.  On that\r\noccasion he spoke exceedingly well, but the attendance was small, an\r\nevening session having been assigned for debate upon that subject.\r\nMr. Shellabarger was logical and effective but he was destitute of\r\nimagination utterly.  At the bar since his retirement from politics he\r\nhas enjoyed a large practice, but, unfortunately, as it appears to me,\r\nhe has preserved the style of speaking which he acquired upon the\r\nstump and in Congress.  A skillful speaker must adapt himself to the\r\ncircumstance and to his audience.  A stump speech, a speech in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, a speech in the Senate, an argument to a\r\ncourt, an argument to a jury, should each be framed on a model of its\r\nown.  Neither style will answer for any other.  The degree of variance\r\nmay not be considerable and with a well disciplined person the change\r\nmay not be apparent.  Mr. Webster adapted himself to every audience,\r\nbut the changes were slight.  Yet there were changes.  He was not over\r\nsolemn in the Supreme Court, and he was never boisterous when he\r\naddressed the multitude.\r\n\r\nAs far as I recollect my positions and arguments in the debates upon\r\nthe counting of the electoral votes, I now discard all I said then.\r\nMy present conclusion is that upon a reasonable construction of the\r\nConstitution there is no occasion for legislation or for an amendment\r\nto the fundamental law.  The Vice-President or the President of the\r\nSenate is the president of the convention.  He carries into the chair\r\nthe ordinary powers of a presiding officer.  He rules upon all\r\nquestions that arise.  He may and should rule upon the various\r\ncertificates that are sent up by the several States.  If, in any case,\r\nhis ruling is objected to, the two Houses separate, and each House\r\nvotes upon the question:--\"Shall the ruling of the Chair stand, etc.\"\r\nIf the Houses divide, the ruling is sustained.  The president and one\r\nHouse are a majority.  The decision is in accordance with our system of\r\ngovernment.  The suggestion that the president or that the Houses may\r\nact under the influence of personal or political prejudice, may, with\r\nequal force, be urged against any scheme that can be devised.  The\r\ncounting of the electoral votes must be left in the hands of men, and\r\nthe Constitution has given us all the security that can be had that the\r\ndecision will be honestly made.  The president of the convention and\r\nthe members of the Houses are bound by oath as solemnly as are the\r\njudicial tribunals of the country.  A judge is only a man, and he is\r\nsubject to like infirmities with other men.  It is a wise feature of\r\nour system that the courts have no voice in the political department\r\nof our Government.  The presidential office should never be in the\r\ncontrol of the judicial branch of the Government.\r\n\r\n[* Letter of the Honorable Thomas B. Bryan.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\nTHE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nI had no part in the preparation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, nor any part in its passage through the House other than\r\nto give my vote in its favor.  The Amendment resolution was passed by\r\nthe Thirty-eighth Congress at its last session and by the aid of\r\nDemocrats.  The elections of 1864 had resulted in a two-thirds majority\r\nand it was therefore certain that the resolution would be agreed to by\r\nthe next House.  Hence there was less inducement for the Democrats to\r\nresist its passage by the Thirty-eighth Congress.  A small number of\r\nDemocrats favored the measure.  English of Connecticut and Ganson of\r\nNew York were of the number.  There were others also whose names I do\r\nnot recall.  At the time of the contest a rumor was abroad that James\r\nM. Ashley, of Ohio, was engaged in making arrangements with certain\r\nDemocrats to absent themselves from the House when the vote was taken.\r\nSeveral were absent--some were reported in ill health.  Mr. Ashley was\r\ndeeply interested in the passage of the resolution and it was believed\r\nthat he made pledges which no one but the President could keep.  Such\r\nwas the exigency for the passage of the resolution that the means were\r\nnot subjected to any rigid rule of ethics.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment had its origin in a joint committee of fifteen\r\nof which Mr. Fessenden of Maine was chairman.  A record of its\r\nproceedings was kept which was printed recently by order of the\r\nSenate.  From that report it appears that I proposed an amendment for\r\nconferring the right to vote upon the freedmen of the State of\r\nTennessee.  As far as I know that was the first time the proposition\r\nwas made in connection with the proceedings of Congress.  The\r\ncommittee did not concur in the proposition.  Indeed the time had not\r\ncome for decisive action in that direction.  The motion was made in\r\nthe committee the 19th day of February, 1866, when the admission of\r\nthe State of Tennessee into the Union was under consideration.  The\r\nmotion was in these words:  \"Said State shall make no distinction in\r\nthe exercise of the elective franchise on account of race or color.\"\r\nThe motion was lost by the following vote:\r\n\r\nYeas:  Howard, Stevens, Washburne, Morrill, Boutwell.\r\nNays:  Harris, Williams, Grider, Bingham, Conkling, Rogers.\r\nAbsent:  Fessenden, Grimes, Johnson, Blow.\r\n\r\nThe 16th day of April Senator Stewart, of Nevada, came before the\r\ncommittee in support of a similar proposition that he had introduced\r\nin the Senate April 7.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1866, a bill was under discussion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives for the establishment of a government in the District\r\nof Columbia.  Mr. Hale of New York moved amendments by which the right\r\nof suffrage by negroes would be limited to those who could read and\r\nwrite, to those who had performed service in the army or navy or who\r\npossessed property qualifications.  The amendment was defeated.  My\r\nviews were thus stated in one of the very small number of my speeches\r\nthat have had immediate influence upon an audience or an assembly:\r\n\r\n\"I am opposed to the instructions moved by the gentleman from New\r\nYork, because I see in them no advantage to anybody, and I apprehend\r\nfrom their adoption much evil to the country.  It should be borne in\r\nmind, that, when we emancipated the black people we not only relieved\r\nourselves from the institution of slavery, we not only conferred upon\r\nthem their freedom, but we did more; we recognized their manhood,\r\nwhich, by the old Constitution and the general policy and usage of the\r\ncountry, had been, from the organization of the Government until the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, denied to all the enslaved colored people.\r\nAs a consequence of the recognition of their manhood, certain results\r\nfollow, in accordance with the principles of the Government; and they\r\nwho believe in this Government are, by necessity, forced to accept\r\nthose results as a consequence of the policy of emancipation which they\r\nhave inaugurated, and for which they are responsible.\r\n\r\n\"But to say now, having given freedom to the blacks, that they shall\r\nnot enjoy the essential rights and privileges of men, is to abandon\r\nthe principle of the Proclamation of Emancipation, and tacitly to admit\r\nthat the whole emancipation policy is erroneous.\r\n\r\n* * * \"What are the qualifications suggested?  They are three.  First\r\nand most attractive, service in the army or navy of the United States.\r\nI shall have occasion to say, if I discuss, as I hope to discuss, the\r\nnature and origin of the right of voting, that there is not the least\r\npossible connection between service in the army and navy and the\r\nexercise of the elective franchise,--none whatever.  These men have\r\nperformed service, and I am for dealing justly with them because they\r\nhave performed service.  But I am more anxious to deal justly by them\r\nbecause they are men.  And when it is remembered, that, for months and\r\nalmost for years after the opening of the rebellion, we refused to\r\naccept the services of colored persons in the armies of the country,\r\nit is with ill grace that we now decline to allow the vote of any man\r\nbecause he has not performed that service.\r\n\r\n\"The second is the property qualification.  I hope it is not necessary\r\nin this day and this hour of the Republic to argue anywhere that a\r\nproperty qualification is not only unjust in itself, but that it is\r\nodious to the people of the country to a degree which cannot be\r\nexpressed.  Everywhere, I believe, for half a century, it has been\r\nrepudiated by the people.  Does anybody contemplate such a\r\nqualification to the elective franchise, in the case of black people\r\nor white?\r\n\r\n\"And next, reading and writing, or reading as a qualification, is\r\ndemanded; and an appeal is made to the example of Massachusetts.  I\r\nwish gentlemen who now appeal to Massachusetts would often appeal to\r\nher in other matters where I can more conscientiously approve her\r\npolicy.  But it is a different proposition in Massachusetts as a\r\npractical measure.\r\n\r\n\"When, ten years ago, this qualification was imposed upon the citizens\r\nof Massachusetts, it excluded no person who was then a voter.  For two\r\ncenturies, we have had in Massachusetts a system of public instruction,\r\nopen to the children of the whole people without money and without\r\nprice.  Therefore all the people there had had opportunities for\r\neducation.  Why should the example of such a State be quoted to\r\njustify refusing suffrage to men who have been denied the privilege\r\nof education, and whom it has been a crime to teach?\r\n\r\n* * * \"The negro has everywhere the same right to vote as the white\r\nman, and I maintain still further, that, when you proceed one step\r\nfrom this line, you admit that your government is a failure.  What is\r\nthe essential quality of monarchical and aristocratic governments?\r\nSimply that by conventionalities, by arrangements of conventions, some\r\npersons have been deprived of the right of voting.  We have attempted\r\nto set up and maintain a government upon the doctrine of the equality\r\nof men, the universal right of all men, to participate in the\r\ngovernment.  In accordance with that theory, we must accept the ballot\r\nupon the principle of equality.  It is enjoyed by the learned and un-\r\nlearned, the wise and the ignorant, the virtuous and the vicious.\r\n\r\n\"The great experiment is going on.  If, before the war, any man in\r\nthis country was disposed to undervalue a government thus conducted, he\r\nshould have learned by this time the wisdom and strength of a\r\ngovernment which embraces and embodies the judgment and the will of the\r\nwhole people.  If the negroes of the South, four million strong, had\r\nbeen endowed with the elective franchise, and had united with the\r\nwhite people of that region in the work of rebellion, your armies would\r\nhave been powerless to subdue that rebellion, and you would to-day have\r\nseen your territory limited by the Potomac and the Ohio.\r\n\r\n* * * \"We are to answer for our treatment of the colored people of this\r\ncountry; and it will prove in the end impracticable to secure to men\r\nof color civil rights, unless the persons who claim those rights are\r\nfortified by the political right of voting.  With the right of voting,\r\neverything that a man ought to have or enjoy of civil rights comes to\r\nhim.  Without the right to vote he is secure in nothing.  I cannot\r\nconsent, after all the guards and safeguards which may be prepared for\r\nthe defence of the colored men in the enjoyment of their rights,--I\r\ncannot consent that they shall be deprived of the right to protect\r\nthemselves.  One hundred and eighty-six thousand of them have been in\r\nthe army of the United States.  They have stood in the places of our\r\nsons and brothers and friends.  Many of them have fallen in the defence\r\nof the country.  They have earned the right to share in the government;\r\nand, if you deny them the elective franchise, I know not how they are\r\nto be protected.  Otherwise you furnish the protection which is given\r\nto the lamb when he is commended to the wolf.\r\n\r\n\"There is an ancient history that a sparrow pursued by a hawk took\r\nrefuge in the chief Assembly of Athens, in the bosom of a member of\r\nthat illustrious body, and that the senator in anger hurled it\r\nviolently from him.  It fell to the ground dead; and such was the\r\nhorror and indignation of that ancient but not Christianized body,--\r\nmen living in the light of nature, of reason,--that they immediately\r\nexpelled the brutal Areopagite from his seat, and from the association\r\nof humane legislators.\r\n\r\n\"What will be said of us, not by Christian, but by heathen nations\r\neven, if, after accepting the blood and sacrifices of these men, we\r\nhurl them from us, and allow them to become the victims of those who\r\nhave tyrannized over them for centuries?  I know of no crime that\r\nexceeds this; I know of none that is its parallel; and, if this country\r\nis true to itself, it will rise in the majesty of its strength, and\r\nmaintain a policy, here and everywhere, by which the right of the\r\ncolored people shall be secure through their own power,--in peace,\r\nthe ballot; in war, the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\"It is a maxim of another language, which we may well apply to\r\nourselves, that, where the voting-register ends, the military roster of\r\nrebellion begins; and, if you leave these four million people to the\r\ncare and custody of the men who have inaugurated and carried on this\r\nrebellion, then you treasure up, for untold years, the elements of\r\nsocial and civil war, which must not only desolate and paralyze the\r\nSouth, but shake this government to its very foundation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was impossible in 1866 to go farther than the provisions of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  That amendment was prepared in form by Senators\r\nConkling and Williams and myself.  We were a select committee on\r\nTennessee.  The propositions were not ours, but we gave form to the\r\namendment.  The part relating to \"privileges and immunities\" came from\r\nMr. Bingham of Ohio.  Its euphony and indefiniteness of meaning were\r\na charm to him.  When the measure came before the Senate Mr. Sumner\r\nopposed its passage and alleged that we proposed to barter the right\r\nof the negroes to vote for diminished representation on the part of\r\nthe old slave States in the House and in the electoral college; while\r\nin truth the loss of representation was imposed as a penalty upon any\r\nState that should deprive any class of its adult male citizens of the\r\nright to vote.  Upon this allegation of Mr. Sumner the resolution was\r\ndefeated in the Senate.  There were then in that body a number of\r\nRepublicans from the old slave States and over them Mr. Sumner had\r\nlarge influence.  The defeat of the amendment was followed by bitter\r\ncriticisms by the Republican press and by Republicans.  These\r\ncriticisms affected Mr. Sumner deeply and he then devoted himself to\r\nthe preparation of an amendment which he could approve.  While he was\r\nengaged in that work I called upon him and he read seventeen drafts of\r\na proposition not one of which was entirely satisfactory to himself,\r\nand not one of which would have been accepted by Congress or the\r\ncountry.  The difficulty was in the situation.  Upon the return of the\r\nseceded States their representation would be increased nearly forty\r\nvotes in the House and in the electoral colleges while the voting force\r\nwould remain in the white population.  The injustice of such a\r\ncondition was apparent, and there were only two possible remedies.\r\nOne was to extend the franchise to the blacks.  The country--the loyal\r\nStates--were not then ready for the measure.  The alternative was to\r\ncut off the representation from States that denied the elective\r\nfranchise to any class of adult male citizens.  Finally Mr. Sumner was\r\ncompelled to accept the alternative.  Some change of phraseology was\r\nmade, and Mr. Sumner gave a reluctant vote for the resolution.\r\n\r\nAside from the debates on the constitutional amendment there were\r\nserious difficulties among Republicans in regard to the exercise of the\r\nright of suffrage by the negroes.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1868 there was a majority of Republicans who would\r\nhave imposed a qualification, some of service in the army or navy,\r\nsome of property and some of education.  It was with great difficulty\r\nthat the scheme of limitation was resisted in regard to the District\r\nof Columbia.  As to the Democrats they could always be counted upon to\r\naid in any measure which tended to keep the negroes in a subordinate\r\ncondition.  This of the majority--there was always a minority, usually\r\na small one, who were ready to aid in the elevation of the negro when\r\nhis emancipation had been accomplished.  I do not recall the name of\r\none man who favored emancipation as a policy and adhered to the\r\nDemocratic Party.  When a man reached the conclusion that the negroes\r\nshould be free, he could not do otherwise than join the Republican\r\nParty.  At the time of the admission of Tennessee, July, 1866, there\r\nwere only twelve men in the House of Representatives who insisted upon\r\nsecuring to the negro the right to vote.  A larger number favored the\r\nscheme, but they yielded to the claim of that State to be admitted\r\nwithout conditions.  At that time the power of the President was not\r\nimpaired seriously, and his wishes were heeded by many.  There was\r\nalso an understanding that the State would concede the right upon terms\r\nnot unreasonable.\r\n\r\nNext to the restoration of the Union and the abolition of slavery the\r\nrecognition of universal suffrage is the most important result of the\r\nwar.  It has its evils but they are incidental, and their influence is\r\nlimited to times and places, while the advantages are universal and\r\nenduring.  Universal suffrage is security for universal education.  It\r\nis security against chronic hostility to the Government and security\r\nagainst the manifestation of a revolutionary spirit among the people.\r\nThey realize that with frequent elections, the evils of administration\r\nmay be corrected speedily.  By a similar though slower process the\r\nfundamental law may be changed.  Hence it is in this country until\r\nrecently there was no difference of opinion as to the wisdom of the\r\nsystem of government under which we are living.  The existing diversity\r\nof opinion will soon disappear.  If suffrage were limited there would\r\nbe a body of discontented people ready to seize upon any pretext that\r\npromised a change.  In the present condition of our system the only\r\ndanger is due to the forcible or fraudulent withholding of the right\r\nfrom those who are entitled to enjoy it.  This condition of things\r\nmust soon end.  The safety of a state is yet further secured by\r\nfrequent elections.  The project to extend the Presidential term is\r\nfull of danger.  If the term were six or ten years the presence of an\r\noffensive or dangerous man in the office would provoke a revolution, or\r\ncause disturbances only less disastrous to business and to social and\r\ndomestic comfort.  In the little republic of Hayti there have been not\r\nless than seventeen revolutions in the hundred years of its existence\r\nand they were due in a large degree to the fact that the Presidential\r\nterm is seven years.\r\n\r\nThe various propositions submitted to the House of Representatives for\r\nsecuring the right to vote to all the male adult citizens of the United\r\nStates were referred to the Judiciary Committee of which I was a\r\nmember.  Among them was one submitted by myself.  In the committee they\r\nwere referred to a sub-committee consisting of myself, Mr. Churchill\r\nof New York, and Mr. Eldridge of Wisconsin.  Mr. Eldridge as a\r\nDemocrat was opposed to the measure, and he took no interest in\r\npreparing the form of an amendment.  Churchill and myself were fellow-\r\nboarders and we prepared and agreed to an amendment in substance that\r\nwhich was adopted finally and which in form was almost the same.  When\r\nI reported the amendment to the committee not one word was said either\r\nin criticism or commendation, nor was there a call for a second\r\nreading.  After a moment's delay Mr. Wilson, the chairman, said:--\"If\r\nthere is no objection Mr. Boutwell will report the amendment to the\r\nHouse.\"  There was no objection and at the earliest opportunity I made\r\nthe report--that is, I reported the resolution for amending the\r\nConstitution.  Mr. Wilson made a speech which I have not since read,\r\nbut which made an impression upon my mind that he was opposed to the\r\nmeasure, or at least had doubts about the wisdom of urging the\r\namendment upon Congress and the country.\r\n\r\nThe resolution passed the House as it was reported by the committee.\r\nWhen it was taken up in the Senate Mr. Sumner, who was opposed to the\r\nresolution, assailed it with an amendment that would have been fatal if\r\nhis lead had been followed by the two Houses.  He proposed to insert\r\nafter the words \"to vote\" the words \"or hold office.\"  At that time he\r\nwas a recognized leader upon all matters relating to the negro race,\r\nand his standing with that race was such that the Republican senators\r\nfrom the slave States were obedient to his wishes.  His amendment was\r\nadopted by the Senate.  In presence of the fact that Mr. Sumner was\r\nopposed to any amendment of the Constitution upon the subject and he\r\nproposed to rely upon a statute, it is difficult to explain his conduct\r\nupon any other theory than that he intended to defeat the measure\r\neither in Congress or in the States.  He had claimed when the\r\nFourteenth Amendment was pending that a joint resolution would furnish\r\nan adequate remedy and protection.  His proposition was in these\r\nwords:  \"There shall be no oligarchy, aristocracy, caste or monopoly\r\ninvested with peculiar privileges and powers and there shall be no\r\ndenial of rights, civil or political, on account of color or race\r\nanywhere within the limits of the United States or the jurisdiction\r\nthereof: but all persons therein shall be equal before the law, whether\r\nin the court room or at the ballot-box.  And this statute made in\r\npursuance of the Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land,\r\nanything in the constitution or laws of any State notwithstanding.\"\r\nThis resolution is a sad impeachment of Mr. Sumner's quality as a\r\nlawyer and it is an equally sad impeachment of his sense or of his\r\nintegrity as a man that he was willing to risk the rights of five\r\nmillion persons upon a statute whose language was rhetorical and\r\nindefinite, a statute which might be repealed and which was quite\r\ncertain to be pronounced unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the resolution and amendment to the House, my own\r\nposition was an embarrassing one.  I was counted as a radical and in\r\nfavor of securing to the negro race every right to which the white race\r\nwas entitled.  My opposition to the Senate amendment seemed to place\r\nme in a light inconsistent with my former professions.  However, I met\r\nthe difficulty by an argument in which I maintained that the right\r\nto vote carried with it the right to hold office.  That in the United\r\nStates there were only a few exceptions, and those were exceptions\r\nunder the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFinally, the House, by a reduced vote refused to concur with the\r\namendment of the Senate.  It was at this crisis that Wendell Phillips\r\nwrote an article in the _Anti-Slavery Standard_ over his own name in\r\nwhich he said in substance and in words, that the House proposition was\r\nadequate and that it ought to be accepted by the Senate.  His name and\r\nopinion settled the controversy.  The Southern Republicans deserted\r\nMr. Sumner feeling that the opinion of Phillips was a sufficient\r\nshield.  A slight change of phraseology was made and the proposition of\r\nthe House became the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI wrote a letter of acknowledgment to Mr. Phillips in the opinion\r\nthat he had saved the amendment.  At that time the prejudice against\r\nnegroes for office was very strong in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and in\r\nvarying degrees the prejudice extended over the whole North.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the right to vote has not been fully secured to the\r\nnegro race, but no one has appeared to deny his right to hold office.\r\nIndeed, the Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party has\r\nplaced him in office, both by election and appointment.  Thus has\r\nexperience shown the folly of Mr. Sumner's amendment.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Sumner should have been willing to risk the rights of the\r\nwhole negro race upon a statute whose constitutionality would have\r\nbeen questioned upon good ground, and which might have been repealed,\r\nis a marvel which no one not acquainted with Mr. Sumner can\r\ncomprehend.  First of all, though he was learned, he was not a lawyer.\r\nHe was impractical in the affairs of government to a degree that is\r\nincomprehensible even to those who knew him.  He was in the Senate\r\ntwenty-three years and the only mark that he left upon the statutes is\r\nan amendment to the law relating to naturalization by which Mongolians\r\nare excluded from citizenship.  The object of his amendment was to\r\nsave negroes from the exclusive features of the statute which was\r\ndesigned to apply only to the Chinese.  His amendment made plain what\r\nthe committee had designed to secure.  He was a great figure in the\r\nwar against slavery and as a great figure in that war he should ever\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment saved the country from a series of calamities\r\nthat might have been more disastrous even than the Civil War.  The\r\nSouth might, under the Fourteenth Amendment, grant to the negroes the\r\nright to vote but upon conditions wholly impracticable and thus have\r\nsecured their full representation in Congress at the same time that the\r\nvoting power was retained in the hands of the white race.  Or they\r\nmight have denied to the negro race the right to vote and submitted to\r\na loss of representation.  Such a policy would have given the whole\r\ncountry over to contention and possibly in the end, to civil war.  The\r\ndiscontented and oppressed negroes, increasing in numbers and wealth,\r\nwould have demanded their rights ultimately, even by the threat of\r\nforce, or by the use of force they would have secured their rights.  In\r\nthe North there would have been a large body of the people, only less\r\nthan the whole body, who would have sympathized with the negroes and\r\nwho, in an exigency would have rendered them material aid.  The Dorr\r\nWar in Rhode Island and the struggles in Kansas, are instances of the\r\ndanger of attempting to found society or to maintain social order upon\r\nan unjust or an unequal system for the distribution of political power.\r\nIt is true that at this time (1901) the operation of the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment has been defeated and consequently the governments of States\r\nand the Government of the United States have become usurpations, in\r\nthat they have been in the hands of a minority of men.  Nevertheless\r\nthe influence of the amendment is felt by all, and the time is not\r\ndistant when it will be accepted by all.  Thus our Government will be\r\nmade to rest upon the wisest and safest foundation yet devised by\r\nman:  The Equality of Men in the States, and the Equality of States in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner opposed the amendment and he declined to vote upon the\r\npassage of the resolution.  Wendell Phillips saved it in the Senate.\r\nGeneral Grant, more than anyone else secured its ratification by the\r\npeople.  I append a copy of my letter to Mr. Phillips:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March_ 13, 1870.\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--\r\n\r\nThis letter will recall to your mind the circumstance that when the\r\nFifteenth Amendment was suspended between the two houses you published\r\nan editorial in the _Standard_ in favor of the House proposition.  Can\r\nyou send me that article?  It may not be known to you that that article\r\nsaved the amendment.  A little of the secret history was thus.  Various\r\npropositions were offered in the House--among them one of my own--and\r\nall were referred to the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nIn the Judiciary Committee, upon my motion the various resolutions for\r\namending the Constitution in that particular were referred to a sub-\r\ncommittee consisting of myself, Churchill of New York and Eldridge of\r\nWisconsin.  Churchill and myself were living at the same house and\r\nconferred together several times.  Eldridge took no interest in the\r\nmatter and never joined us--perhaps he was not invited.  After an\r\nexamination of all the plans I wrote that proposed amendment which was\r\npassed by the House and is in substance and almost in language the\r\namendment as adopted.\r\n\r\nWith the concurrence of Mr. Churchill I reported it to the committee\r\nand without one word of criticism and as far as I could judge without\r\nany particular consideration I was directed to report it to the House.\r\nIn the House it encountered considerable opposition and Mr. Wilson,\r\nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, made a speech which was a great\r\nsurprise to me, though directed chiefly to the bill which I had also\r\nreported by direction of the Judiciary Committee giving at once the\r\nright of suffrage to negroes in all national elections and for members\r\nof the Legislature.  This I thought necessary to secure the passage of\r\nthe amendment through the State Legislatures.  However, the resolution\r\nwas finally passed by the House.  In the Senate it met with great\r\nopposition because it omitted to secure in terms the right to hold\r\noffice.  This point had been raised in the House where I had\r\nsuccessfully met the proposition by the statement and an argument in\r\nsupport of the statement that the right to vote as a matter of fact and\r\nin law carries with it the right to hold office.  In the Senate, Mr.\r\nSumner, supported by all the Southern Republicans and a part of the\r\nNorthern Republicans succeeded in substituting a new resolution\r\nsecuring in terms the right to hold office.  Upon the return of the\r\nResolution to the House I was obliged to take what appeared a\r\nconservative position and resist the proposition to concur with the\r\nSenate upon the ground that the change was unnecessary and that its\r\nadoption threatened the loss of the measure in doubtful States as Ohio,\r\nIndiana, West Virginia and others.  The House adhered to its position,\r\nyet with such weakness of purpose on the part of many who sustained me,\r\nas indicated that they would not withstand another assault.  The\r\nstruggle was then renewed in the Senate and with every indication that\r\nthe Senate would insist upon its amendment.  It was then that your\r\narticle appeared.  Its influence was immediate and potential.  Men\r\nthought that if you the extremest radical could accept the House\r\nproposition they might safely do the same.  Had the Senate adhered one\r\nof two things would have happened, either the House would have seceded\r\nor the amendment would have failed.\r\n\r\nHad the House concurred I fear we should have failed to carry several\r\nStates which have since ratified it.\r\n\r\nUpon reflection I think as at the time I thought that your voice saved\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nI am very truly,\r\nGEO. S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nP. S.  This letter is not for the public use in so far as names are\r\nmentioned, and of course, not for publication.\r\nG. S. B.\r\n\r\nThe article of Mr. Phillips became so important in its influence upon\r\nthe final action of the Senate that I reproduce it in justice to Mr.\r\nPhillips and as a further record of an historical event.\r\n\r\n\"We see the action of the Senate touching the Constitutional\r\nAmendment with great anxiety.  The House had passed a simple measure,\r\none covering all the ground that people are ready to occupy.  It\r\nanswered completely the lesson of the war.  Its simplicity gave it all\r\nthe chance that exists for any form of amendment being ratified.\r\n\r\n\"Why was it not left in that shape?  Leaving out of sight the manifest\r\nrisk of attempting too much, the very fact of the little time left\r\nbefore the session closes, was warning enough to clutch at anything\r\nsatisfactory and to run no risk of possible disagreement between the\r\nHouses.  We wait further knowledge before indulging any conjectures as\r\nto the motive for this strange course of the Senate; before even\r\nsuspecting that it grew out of any concealed hate toward the whole\r\nmeasure and was indeed a trick to defeat it.  Whoever, in either House,\r\ngratifies some personal whim to the extent of defeating or even\r\npostponing this measure will incur the gravest responsibility.  We\r\nexhort every man who professes himself a friend of liberty to drop all\r\nundue attachment to any form of words and to co-operate, heartily,\r\nearnestly, with the great body of the members in carrying through as\r\npromptly as possible, any form which included the substance of a\r\nconstitutional protection to the votes and right to office of the\r\ncolored race.  That is the work of the hour.  That is the lesson the\r\nwar has burned in on the brain and conscience of the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"To include with this, 'Nationality, education, creed,' etc., is utter\r\nlack of common sense.  Such a total forgetfulness of the commonest\r\npolitical prudence as makes it hard to credit the good intentions of\r\nthe proposers.\r\n\r\n\"Our disappointment is the greater because we had reason to believe\r\nthat the Senators who have this matter in charge, would be the last\r\nmen to forget themselves at such a crisis.  They have been timidly\r\n'practical,' ludicrously tied up to precedents, when, in times past we\r\nhave urged them to some act which seemed likely to jeopard party.  Then\r\nSir Oracle was never more sententious, more full of 'wise saws and\r\nmodern instances,' than they.  The inch they were willing to move ahead\r\nwas hardly visible to the naked eye.  How they lectured us on the 'too\r\nfast' and 'too far' policy!  Now in an emergency which calls for the\r\nmost delicate handling, they tear up not one admitted abuse, but\r\ninclude in the grasp half a dozen obstinate prejudices, which no logic\r\nof events has loosened.  For the first time in our lives we beseech\r\nthem to be a little more _politicians_--and a little less _reformers_--\r\nas those functions are usually understood.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the date of March 18, 1869, I received from Mr. Phillips a letter\r\nin acknowledgment of my letter of thanks and commendation, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the intimation in your letter.  I am glad if any words\r\nof mine helped get rid of the too prompt action at that time.  I\r\nthink it was of the greatest importance to act at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe public mind seems to be misled in regard to the scope and legal\r\nvalue of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  The amendments were\r\nin the nature of grants of power to the National Government, and in a\r\ncorresponding degree they were limitations of the powers of the States,\r\nbut the grants of power to the nation were also subject to limitations.\r\nUntil the ratification of the amendments the States had full power to\r\nextend the right of suffrage, or to restrict its enjoyment with the\r\nfreedom that they possessed when the Treaty of Peace of 1783 had been\r\nsigned, and when the Constitution had not been framed and ratified.\r\n\r\nAll limitations of the right of suffrage by male inhabitants of\r\ntwenty-one years of age, must fall under the control of the Fourteenth\r\nor Fifteenth Amendments.\r\n\r\nIf in any State the right to vote shall be \"denied or abridged on\r\naccount of race, color or previous condition of servitude,\" the\r\nstatutes may be annulled by a decision of the Supreme Court.  Neither\r\nthe people of the United States in their political sovereignty, nor\r\nthe political branch of the Government in its representative capacity\r\ncan exert any direct influence upon the decision of the questions that\r\nmay arise.  The questions that may arise will be judicial questions,\r\nand they will fall under the decision of the judicial tribunals.  Hence\r\nthere has never been a time when it was the duty or when it was in the\r\npower or within the scope of the duty of the executive branch of the\r\nNational Government to take official notice of the legislation in some\r\nof the former slave States, which is designed manifestly to limit the\r\nvoting power of the negro population in those States.\r\n\r\nIf such legislation does not fall under the Fifteenth Amendment it will\r\nbe subject to the penalty imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment,--a\r\nproportionate loss of representative power in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and in the Electoral Colleges.\r\n\r\nAs one of the three remaining members of the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary, and as one of the three remaining members of the Committee\r\non Reconstruction, I wish to say, without any reservation whatever,\r\nthat the amendments are accomplishing and are destined to accomplish\r\nall that was expected by the committees that were charged with the\r\nduty of providing for the protection of the rights of the freedmen.\r\n\r\nThey were relived from the disparaging distinctions that came into\r\nexistence with the system of slavery.  They were placed upon an\r\nequality with other citizens and in the forms of law all\r\ndiscriminations affecting unfavorably the right of suffrage must\r\napply equally to all citizens.  The injustice and unwisdom of the\r\nrestrictive legislation in which the Southern States are indulging,\r\nare subject of concern for the whole country, but the negro populations\r\nhave no ground for the complaint that their rights have been neglected\r\nby the General Government.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is true:  The negro population, in common with all\r\nothers, has ground for just and continuing complaint against the\r\nlegislation of Congress by which a portion of the inhabitants of the\r\nHawaiian Islands have been denationalized on account of race or color,\r\nor on account of a condition of mental or physical inferiority.\r\n\r\nThe process of reasoning by which the legislation of the States of the\r\nSouth is condemned, by those who uphold the legislation in regard to\r\nHawaii involves a question in political ethics which for the moment I\r\nam not able to answer in a manner satisfactory to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\nINVESTIGATIONS FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nIn the years 1865, '66 and '67 three important subjects of inquiry were\r\nplaced in the hands of committees of which I was a member.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives by\r\nresolutions adopted respectively the 9th and 30th days of April, 1866,\r\nwas directed \"to inquire into the nature of the evidence implicating\r\nJefferson Davis and others in the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nJames M. Ashley of Ohio introduced a resolution for the impeachment of\r\nPresident Johnson, and on the 7th day of January, 1867, the House\r\nauthorized the Committee on the Judiciary \"to inquire into the official\r\nconduct of Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United States,\r\ndischarging the powers and duties of President of the United States,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBy a resolution of the two Houses of Congress passed the 12th and 13th\r\nof December, 1865, a joint committee was created under instructions to\r\n\"inquire into the condition of the States which formed the so-called\r\nConfederate States of America and report whether they or any of them\r\nare entitled to be represented in either House of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt Fessenden was chairman on the part of the Senate and\r\nThaddeus Stevens was chairman of the part of the House.  Upon the\r\ndeath of Mr. Stevens I succeeded to his place.  The testimony taken\r\nin these cases fills three huge volumes.  No inconsiderable part of the\r\ntestimony was taken by myself, and I was but seldom absent from the\r\nmeetings of the committees.\r\n\r\nJOHN WILKES BOOTH\r\n\r\nIn no other situation in life is the character of a man more fully and\r\ntruthfully brought into view than when he is placed upon the witness-\r\nstand and subjected to an examination by counsel or others who aim to\r\nsupport opposite opinions and to reach adverse results.  The committees\r\nthat conducted the investigations were composed of men who entertained\r\nopposite views in regard to the reconstruction of the government and in\r\nregard to the impeachment of President Johnson.  There was also a\r\ndifference of opinion upon the question of the responsibility of the\r\nConfederate authorities for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.  As a\r\nconsequence of this diversity of opinion the witnesses were subjected\r\nto the equivalent of a cross-examination in a court of justice.  Some\r\nof the impressions of men that I received in the many hearings, and\r\nsome of the opinions I formed, are recorded here.\r\n\r\nIn each branch of these comprehensive inquiries there may be found\r\nsomething in the nature of evidence that may appear to have a bearing\r\nupon the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.  It is my purpose in these\r\nparagraphs to bring in to view the testimony which relates directly to\r\nJohn Wilkes Booth, the most conspicuous and without question the chief\r\ncriminal in the tragedy of the assassination of President Lincoln, and\r\nthe attempt upon the life of Mr. Seward.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the proceedings which culminated in the murder was\r\nthe deposit at Surrattsville (a place about five miles from Washington,\r\nand owned by the Surratt family) of a carbine, two bottles of whiskey,\r\na small coil of rope, a field glass, a monkey wrench, and some other\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThe house was kept by a man named Lloyd, and neither the character of\r\nthe house nor that of the keeper could bear a rigid test in ethics.\r\nThe deposit was made about the first of March by John H. Surratt,\r\nAtzerodt and David E. Herold, all of whom were afterwards implicated\r\nin the crime.  The articles were received and secreted by Lloyd, but\r\nonly after objections by him, as appears from his testimony.  Lloyd\r\nconnected Mrs. Surratt with the crime by these facts as related by\r\nhim.  She called upon Lloyd the Tuesday preceding the fatal Friday\r\nand gave him this message:  \"She told me to have them ready (speaking\r\nof the shooting-iron) that they would be called for or wanted soon,\r\nI have forgotten which.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Surratt made a second call the afternoon preceding the murder,\r\nwhen this conversation took place, as stated by Lloyd:  \"When I drove\r\nup in my buggy to the back yard Mrs. Surratt came out to meet me.  She\r\nhanded me a package, and told me as well as I remember to get the guns\r\nor those things--I really forget now which, though my impression is\r\nthat guns was the expression she made use of--and a couple of bottles\r\nof whisky and give them to whoever should call for them that night.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, after the murder, Booth and Herold called, and took the\r\ncarbine and drank of the whisky.  In these facts there is a basis for\r\na reasonable theory.  The theory is this.  Previous to the fall of\r\nRichmond and the surrender of Lee's army the Confederate authorities\r\nset on foot a scheme for the capture and abduction of Mr. Lincoln.\r\nThe articles deposited, including the rope and the monkey wrench,\r\nmight be useful had Mr. Lincoln been abducted, but when the crime\r\nbecame murder the rope and wrench were neglected.\r\n\r\nThis view derives support from two directions.  In Booth's diary is\r\nthis entry.  \"April 13-14 Friday.  The Ides.  Until to-day nothing was\r\never thought of sacrificing to our country's wrongs.  For six months\r\nwe had worked to capture.  But our cause being almost lost something\r\ndecisive and great must be done.  But its failure was owing to others\r\nwho did not strike for their country with a heart.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Baker, a detective, testified that when he was in Canada,\r\nengaged in negotiations for the purchase of letters that had passed\r\nbetween the Confederate authorities at Richmond and Clay, Tucker,\r\nThompson and others, he read a letter from Jefferson Davis to Jacob\r\nThompson dated March 8, 1865, in which was this expression:  \"The\r\nconsummation of the act that would have done more to have ended this\r\nterrible strife, being delayed, has probably ruined our cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe scheme for the abduction of Mr. Lincoln was a wild scheme, born of\r\ndesperation, and its success would have worked only evil to the\r\nConfederacy.  The purpose of the North would have been strengthened,\r\nthe public feeling would have been embittered and the friendship of\r\nEngland and of the Continental states would have been suppressed.\r\nWhen Lee had surrendered, when Davis was fleeing from Richmond, when\r\nBenjamin was preparing to leave the country, the leaders of the\r\nConfederacy could not have entertained a project for the capture of\r\nMr. Lincoln, nor of any injury to him whatever.  Their opposition to\r\nMr. Lincoln was not tainted with personal hostility.  One fact remains;\r\nthe persons who had knowledge of the project to abduct Mr. Lincoln and\r\nwho were engaged in it at Washington, were implicated in the final\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nIf Booth's diary can be accepted as a faithful representation of his\r\nmental condition it will appear that he had on that fatal Friday\r\nsubmitted himself to the influence of three strong passions.  He had\r\naccepted the South as his country, and he had come to look upon Mr.\r\nLincoln as a tyrant and as its enemy.  Hence he was influenced with\r\nhatred for Mr. Lincoln.  Finally he had become maddened by an ambition\r\nto rival, or to excel Brutus.  The influence of his possession is to\r\nbe seen in the entries in his diary in the days following the 14th of\r\nApril:\r\n\r\n\"I can never repent it, though we hated to kill.  Our country owed all\r\nour troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\"The country is not what it was.  This forced union is not what I have\r\nloved.  I have not desired to outlive my country. . . . After being\r\nhunted like a dog through swamps, woods, and last night being chased\r\nby gunboats till I was forced to return wet, cold, and starving with\r\nevery man's hand against me, I am here in despair.  And why?  For doing\r\nwhat Brutus was honored for--what made Tell a hero.  And yet I for\r\nstriking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew, am looked upon as\r\na common cut-throat.  My action was purer than either of theirs.  One\r\nhoped to be great.  The other had not only his country's, but his own\r\nwrongs to avenge.  I knew no private wrong.  I struck for my country\r\nand that alone.  A country that groaned beneath this tyranny, and\r\nprayed for the end, and yet now behold the cold hand they extend to me.\r\n\r\n\"God cannot pardon me if I have done wrong, yet I cannot see my wrong\r\nexcept in serving a degenerate people.  The little, the very little I\r\nleft behind to clear my name, the Government will not allow to be\r\nprinted.  So ends all.  For my country I have given up all that makes\r\nlife sweet and holy, brought misery upon my family, and am sure there\r\nis no pardon for me in Heaven since man so condemns me.\r\n\r\n\"I do not repent of the blow I struck.  I may before my God but not to\r\nman.  I think I have done well.  Thought I am abandoned with the curse\r\nof Cain upon me, when if the world knew my heart that one blow would\r\nhave made me great, though I did desire no greatness.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, he writes:\r\n\r\n\"I bless the entire world.  Have never hated or wronged anyone.  This\r\nlast was not a wrong unless God deems it so; and it is with him to\r\ndamn or bless me.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from Booth's diary reveal the influences that controlled\r\nhim in the great tragedy in which he became the principal actor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Booth was only a lesser tragedy than the death of Mr.\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nFollowing the murder and escape of Booth a small military force was\r\norganized hastily under the direction and command of Colonel Lafayette\r\nC. Baker, a detective in the service of the War Department.  The force\r\nconsisted of about thirty men chiefly convalescents from the army\r\nhospitals in Washington.  Colonel Everton G. Conger was in command of\r\nthe expedition, and his testimony contains a clear account of what\r\ntranspired at Garrett's Farm, where Booth was captured and shot.\r\nConger reached Garrett's Farm on the night of the 25th of April, or the\r\nearly morning of the 26th.  The men were posted around the tobacco shed\r\nin which Booth and Herold were secreted and their surrender was\r\ndemanded by Conger.  Booth refused to surrender and tendered, as a\r\ncounter proposition, a personal contest with the entire force.  Herold\r\nsurrendered.  Upon Booth's persistent refusal to surrender, a fire was\r\nlighted in a corner of the building.  Booth then came forward with his\r\ncarbine in his hand and engaged in a conversation with Lieut. L. Byron\r\nBaker.  While so engaged a musket was fired from the opposite side of\r\nthe shed and Booth fell, wounded fatally in the neck, at or near the\r\nspot where Mr. Lincoln had been struck.  Conger had given orders to the\r\nmen not to shoot under any circumstances.  The examination disclosed\r\nthe fact that the shot was fired by a sergeant, named Boston Corbett.\r\nWhen Colonel Conger asked Corbett why he shot without orders Corbett\r\nsaluted the colonel and said:  \"Colonel, Providence directed me.\"\r\nThus the parallel runs.  Booth claimed that he was the instrument of\r\nthe Almighty in the assassination of Lincoln, and Boston Corbett\r\nclaimed that he acted under the direction of Providence when he shot\r\nBooth.\r\n\r\nBooth was shot at about three o'clock in the morning of April 26, and\r\nhe died at fifteen minutes past seven.  During that time he was\r\nconscious for about three fourths of an hour.  He asked whether a\r\nperson called Jett had betrayed him.  His only other intelligible\r\nremark was this:\r\n\r\n\"Tell my mother I died for my country.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon preceding the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, Booth\r\nmet John Matthews a brother actor, and requested him to hand a letter\r\nto Mr. Coyle, of the _National Intelligencer,_ the next morning.\r\nMathews had a part in the play at Ford's Theater.  When the shot was\r\nfired and Mathews was changing his dress to leave the theater, he\r\ndiscovered the letter, which for the time he had forgotten.  When he\r\nreached his rooms he opened the letter.  It contained an avowal of\r\nBooth's purpose to murder the President, and he named three of his\r\nassociates.  Booth referred to a plan that had failed, and he then\r\nadded:  \"The moment has at length arrived when my plans must be\r\nchanged.\"  These statements were made by Mathews from recollection.\r\nMathews destroyed the letter under the influence of the apprehension\r\nthat its possession would work his ruin.\r\n\r\nThe records seem to warrant certain conclusions:\r\n\r\n1.  That the Confederate authorities at Richmond made a plan for the\r\ncapture of Mr. Lincoln, and that Booth, Mrs. Surratt and others--who\r\nwere implicated finally in the murder--were concerned in the project\r\nto abduct the President and to hold him a hostage.\r\n\r\n2.  That the undertaking failed.\r\n\r\n3.  That following Lee's surrender and the downfall of the Confederacy,\r\nBooth originated the plan to murder the President, under the influence\r\nof the motives and reasons that are set forth in his diary and in the\r\nletter to Mr. Coyle.\r\n\r\n4.  His influence over the persons who were involved in the conspiracy\r\nto abduct Mr. Lincoln, was so great that he was able to command their\r\naid in the commission of the final crime.\r\n\r\nWhen the investigations were concluded there remained in the possession\r\nof the Committee on the Judiciary a quantity of papers, affidavits,\r\nletters and memoranda of no value as evidence.  These were placed\r\nwithin a sealed package.  The package was deposited with the clerk of\r\nthe House of Representatives.  The preservation of the papers may have\r\nbeen an error.  They should have been destroyed by the committee.  Some\r\ndoubts were expressed however as to the authority of the committee.\r\nFurther investigations were suggested as not impossible.  I am the only\r\nperson living who has knowledge of the papers.  They are now in the\r\npossession of the House of Representatives.  It is not in the public\r\ninterest that the papers should become the possession of the public.\r\n\r\nMR. LINCOLN AND THE ATTACK ON FORT SUMTER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of John Minor Botts of Virginia, given before the Joint\r\nCommittee on Reconstruction, February 18, 1866, presents Mr. Lincoln as\r\na diplomatist at the outset of his experience as President.\r\n\r\nMr. Botts had been a leading member of the Whig Party and he was a\r\nUnion man from the beginning of the contest to the end of the war.  As\r\nthe work of secession was advancing in the Gulf States Mr. Lincoln\r\nbecame anxious for the fate of the border States and especially for\r\nVirginia and Kentucky, which promised to serve as barriers to the\r\naggressive movements of the South in case of war.  Mr. Botts came to\r\nWashington at the request of Mr. Lincoln in the early days of April,\r\n1861, and they were together and in private conversation during the\r\nevening of the 7th of April from seven to eleven o'clock.  In the\r\nconversation of that evening the President gave Mr. Botts an account\r\nof the steps that he had taken to prevent a collision in the harbor\r\nof Charleston.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers and Mr. Baldwin of Virginia had been delegates in the Peace\r\nCongress and they had been counted among the Union men of the State.\r\nSoon after the inauguration the President was informed that the small\r\ngarrison in Fort Sumter was nearly destitute of provisions and that\r\nan attempt to add to the supply would be resisted.  The President,\r\nMr. Summers and Mr. Botts had served together as Whigs in the Thirtieth\r\nCongress and the President invited Mr. Summers by letter and by special\r\nmessenger to a conference in Washington.  To this invitation no\r\nanswer was given by Mr. Summers until the 5th of April, when Mr.\r\nBaldwin appeared and said that he had come upon the request of Mr.\r\nSummers.  Mr. Lincoln said at once:  \"Ah!  Mr. Baldwin, why did you\r\nnot come sooner?  I have been expecting you gentlemen to come to me\r\nfor more than a week past.  I had a most important proposition to make\r\nto you.  I am afraid you have come too late.  However, I will make the\r\nproposition now.  We have in Fort Sumter with Major Anderson about\r\neighty men and I learn from Major Anderson that his provisions are\r\nnearly exhausted . . . I have not only written to Governor Pickens, but\r\nI have sent a special messenger to say that if he will allow Major\r\nAnderson to obtain his marketing at the Charleston market, or, if he\r\nobjects to allowing our people to land at Charleston, if he will have\r\nit sent to him, then I will make no effort to provision the fort, but,\r\nthat if he does not do that, I will not permit these people to starve,\r\nand that I shall send provisions down,--and that if fires on that\r\nvessel he will fire upon an unarmed vessel, loaded with nothing but\r\nbread but I shall at the same time send a fleet along with her, with\r\ninstructions not to enter the harbor of Charleston unless the vessel\r\nis fired into; and if she is, then the fleet is to enter the harbor\r\nand protect her.  Now, Mr. Baldwin, that fleet is now lying in the\r\nharbor of New York and will be ready to sail this afternoon at five\r\no'clock, and although I fear it is almost too late, yet I will submit\r\nanyway the proposition which I intended for Mr. Summers.  Your\r\nconvention in Richmond, Mr. Baldwin, has been sitting now nearly two\r\nmonths and all they have done has been to shake the rod over my head.\r\nYou have recently taken a vote in the Virginia Convention, on the right\r\nof secession, which was rejected by ninety to forty-five, a majority\r\nof two thirds, showing the strength of the Union Party in that\r\nconvention; and, if you will go back to Richmond and get that Union\r\nmajority to adjourn and go home without passing the ordinance of\r\nsecession, so anxious am I for the preservation of the peace of this\r\ncountry and to save Virginia and the other States from going out, that\r\nI will take the responsibility of evacuating Fort Sumter, and take the\r\nchance of negotiating with the cotton States, which have already gone\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThis quotation is from the testimony of Mr. Botts and there cannot be\r\nbetter evidence of the facts existing in the first days of April, nor\r\na more trustworthy statement of the position of Mr. Lincoln in regard\r\nto the secession movement.  At that time the Virginia Convention had\r\nrejected a proposed ordinance of secession by a vote of ninety to\r\nforty-five, and there can be no doubt that Mr. Lincoln had hopes that\r\nhis proposition might calm the temper and change the purposes of the\r\nsecessionists in that State if he did not change the schemes of\r\nGovernor Pickens, of which, indeed, the prospect was only slight.\r\n\r\nIn his Inaugural Address, and in all his other public utterances, Mr.\r\nLincoln sought to place the responsibility of war upon the seceding\r\nStates.  At a later day Mr. Lincoln, in a conversation with Senator\r\nSumner and myself, expressed regret that he had neglected to station\r\ntroops in Virginia in advance of the occupation of the vicinity of\r\nAlexandria by the Confederates, a course of action to which he had\r\nbeen urged by Mr. Chase and others.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's proposition for the relief of Fort Sumter was rejected\r\nby Mr. Baldwin, as was the proposition for the adjournment of the\r\nconvention, _sine die_.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Botts appeared the time had passed when arrangements could\r\nhave been made for the relief of Sumter and the adjournment of the\r\nconvention.  Although the situation may not have been realized at the\r\ntime it was not the less true that Mr. Botts and the small number\r\nof Union men in Virginia were powerless in presence of the movement\r\nin favor of secession under the lead of Tyler, Seddon and others.\r\n\r\nThe political side of Mr. Lincoln's character is seen in the fact that\r\nhe enjoined secrecy upon Mr. Botts.  He may have been unwilling to\r\nallow his supporters in the North to know how far he had gone in the\r\nline of conciliation.  In the conversation with Mr. Baldwin, Mr.\r\nLincoln had given an assurance that upon the acceptance of his two\r\npropositions he would evacuate Fort Sumter.  When Mr. Lincoln made\r\nthese facts known to Mr. Botts at the evening interview, Mr. Botts\r\nsaid;  \"Will you authorize me to make that proposition to the Union\r\nmen of the convention?  I will take a steamboat to-morrow morning,\r\nand have a meeting of the Union men to-morrow night, I will guarantee\r\nwith my head, that they will adopt your proposition.\"  In reply, Mr.\r\nLincoln said:  \"It is too late.  The fleet has sailed.\"  In truth it\r\nwas too late for the acceptance of the propositions in Virginia.  The\r\nUnion men were powerless, and the secessionists were dominant in\r\naffairs and already vindictive.  The charge that Mr. Seward gave a\r\npromise that Sumter would be abandoned, may or it may not have been\r\ntrue, but there can be no ground for doubting the statement made by\r\nMr. Botts in regard to the terms tendered by Mr. Lincoln, and which\r\nwere rejected by Mr. Baldwin.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin admitted the interview with Mr. Lincoln, and the nature of\r\nit as herein given, to Mr. John F. Lewis, who was a Union man and a\r\nmember of the convention that adopted the Ordinance of Secession by\r\na vote of eighty-eight to fifty-five.\r\n\r\nOf the three witnesses, Baldwin, Botts and Lewis, Mr. Baldwin was the\r\nfirst witness who was examined by the Committee on Reconstruction.\r\nAt that time the committee had no knowledge of the conversation\r\nbetween Mr. Baldwin and President Lincoln.  Speaking, apparently, under\r\nthe influence of the criticisms of Botts and Lewis of his rejection of\r\nMr. Lincoln's propositions, Baldwin introduced the subject with the\r\nremark:  \"I had a good deal of interesting conversation with him (that\r\nis with Mr. Lincoln) that evening.  I was about to state that I have\r\nreason to believe that Mr. Lincoln himself had given an account of\r\nthis conversation which has been understood--but I am sure\r\n_mis_understood--by the persons with whom he talked, as giving the\r\nrepresentation of it, that he had offered to me, that if the Virginia\r\nConvention would adjourn _sine die_ he would withdraw the troops from\r\nSumner and _Pickens_.\"  As there was no occasion in the conversation\r\nbetween Lincoln and Baldwin for a reference to Fort Pickens, and as the\r\nPresident did not mention _Fort Pickens_ in the account of the\r\nconversation that he gave to Mr. Botts, the denial of Mr. Baldwin may\r\nfall under one of the forms of falsehood mentioned by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is conclusive to this point:  That at an interview at the\r\nExecutive Mansion, April 5, 1861, between President Lincoln and Colonel\r\nJohn B. Baldwin, then a member of the Virginia Convention that finally\r\nadopted the Ordinance of Secession, President Lincoln assured Mr.\r\nBaldwin that he would evacuate Fort Sumter if the fort could be\r\nprovisioned and the Virginia Convention would adjourn _sine die_.\r\n\r\nColonel Baldwin's voluntary and qualified denial is of no value in\r\npresence of President Lincoln's report of the interview as given by\r\nMr. Botts and in presence of the testimony that Mr. Baldwin did not\r\ndeny the truthfulness of Mr. Botts' limited statement, when it was\r\nasserted by Mr. Botts in the presence of Lewis.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER H. STEPHENS AND HIS STATE-RIGHTS DOCTRINES\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. Calhoun the task of maintaining the extreme\r\ndoctrine of State Rights, as that doctrine had been taught by Mr.\r\nCalhoun fell upon Jefferson Davis and Alexander H. Stephens.  That\r\ndoctrine was carried to its practical results in the ordinances of\r\nsecession as they were adopted by the respective States under the lead\r\nof Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Stephens advised against secession, the advice given was not due\r\nto any doubt of the right of a State to secede from the Union, but to\r\ndoubts of the wisdom of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn form of proceedings Mr. Stephens was examined by the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary, the 11th and 12th days of April, 1866, but in fact I was\r\nthe only member of the committee who was present, and I conducted the\r\nexamination in my own way, and without help or hindrance from others.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Governor Clifford of Massachusetts, that the\r\nexamination of Mr. Stephens gave the best exposition of the doctrine\r\nof State Rights that had been made.  I was then ignorant of the fact,\r\nthat in the convention of 1787 the form of the Preamble to the\r\nConstitution was so changed as to justify the opinion, if not to\r\nwarrant the conclusion that the State-Rights doctrines had been\r\nconsidered and abandoned.  In two plans of a constitution, one\r\nsubmitted by Mr. Randolph, and one by Mr. Charles Pinckney, and in\r\nthe original draft of the Constitution as reported by Mr. Rutledge,\r\nthe source of authority was laid in the respective States, which were\r\nnamed.  This form was adhered to in the Rutledge report, which was made\r\nAugust 6, 1787.  On the 12th of September the Committee on Style\r\nreported the Preamble which opens thus:  _\"We the people of the United\r\nStates, etc.\"_  This change seems not to have been known to Mr.\r\nWebster, nor have I noticed a reference to it in any of the speeches\r\nthat were made in the period of the active controversy on the\r\ndoctrine of State Rights.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens was a clear-headed and uncompromising expositor and\r\ndefender of the doctrine of State Rights as the doctrine was accepted\r\nby General Lee and by the inhabitants generally of the slave States.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens did not disguise his opinions:  \"When the State seceded\r\nagainst my judgment and vote, I thought my ultimate allegiance was due\r\nto her, and I prepared to cast my fortunes and destinies with hers and\r\nher people rather than take any other course, even though it might\r\nlead to my sacrifice and her ruin.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was asked for his reason for accepting the office of vice-\r\npresident in the Confederacy, he said:  \"My sole object was to do all\r\nthe good I could in preserving and perpetuating the principles of\r\nliberty as established under the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\nMr. Stephens advanced to his position by conclusively logical\r\nprocesses.  Standing upon the ground of Mr. Lincoln and the Republican\r\nParty, he assumed that, inasmuch as the States in rebellion had never\r\nbeen out of the Union, they had had the opportunity at all times during\r\nthe war of withdrawing from the contest and resuming their places in\r\nthe Senate and House as though nothing had occurred of which the\r\nexisting government could take notice.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there were to be terms of adjustment, then those terms\r\nmust have a \"continental basis founded upon the principles of mutual\r\nconvenience and reciprocal advantage, and the recognition of the\r\nseparate sovereignty of the States.\"  He was ready for a conference or\r\nconvention of all the States, but he did not admit the right of the\r\nsuccessful party to dictate terms to the States that had been in\r\nrebellion.  He expressed the personal, individual opinion, that tax\r\nlaws passed in the absence of representatives from the seceded States\r\nwould be unconstitutional.  It was the opinion of Mr. Stephens that\r\nthe people of Georgia by a large majority thought that the State was\r\nentitled to representation in the national Congress and without any\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWhen he was invited to consider the alternative of universal suffrage\r\nor a loss of representation as a condition precedent to the\r\nrestoration of the State, he said with confidence that neither branch\r\nof the alternative would be accepted.  \"If Georgia is a State in the\r\nUnion her people feel that she is entitled to representation without\r\nconditions imposed by Congress; and if she is not a State in the Union\r\nthen she could not be admitted as an equal with the others if her\r\nadmission were trammeled with conditions that did not apply to all the\r\nrest alike.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been his expectation, and in his opinion such had been the\r\nexpectation of the people generally that the State would assume its\r\nplace in the Union whenever the cause of the Confederacy should be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of the State-Rights doctrines as announced by\r\nthe most intellectual of the Southern leaders in the war of the\r\nRebellion.  In the opinion of Mr. Stephens a State could retire from\r\nthe Union either for purposes of peace or of war and return at will,\r\nand all without loss of place or power.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his examination he made this declaration:  \"My\r\nconvictions on the original abstract question have undergone no change.\"\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the doctrines of Mr. Stephens, I mention the history of\r\nAndrew J. Lewis.  When the Legislature of Massachusetts assembled in\r\nJanuary, 1851, Lewis took a seat in the House as the Democratic member\r\nfrom the town of Sandisfield.  He acted with the Coalitionists, and he\r\nvoted for Mr. Sumner as United States Senator.  Lewis was returned for\r\nthe year 1852, and in General Pierce's administration he held an office\r\nin the Boston Customs House.\r\n\r\nUpon the fall of Port Hudson I received a letter from General Banks.\r\nIn that letter he mentioned the fact that Lewis was among the\r\nprisoners, holding the office of captain in a South Carolina regiment.\r\nHis account of himself was this:  \"I was born in South Carolina.  When\r\nmy State seceded I thought I must go too, and so I left Massachusetts\r\nand returned to South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nGENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's examination during the investigation embraced a variety\r\nof topics and the report is a volume of not less than twenty thousand\r\nwords.  His testimony is marked by the qualities for which he was known\r\nboth on the civil and military side of his career.  These qualities\r\nwere clearness of thought, accuracy and readiness of memory, directness\r\nof expression and the absence of remarks in the nature of exaggeration\r\nor embellishment.  The character of the man and the history of events\r\nmay gain something from an examination of his testimony upon three\r\nimportant points to which it related:  the opinion of President Lincoln\r\nin regard to the reconstruction of the government; the opinion of\r\nPresident Johnson upon the same subject, and his own view of the\r\nrights of General Lee and of the army under his command that had\r\nsurrendered at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nWhen President Johnson entered upon the work of reconstructing the\r\ngovernment of North Carolina it was claimed that he was giving form\r\nand effect to the plan which President Lincoln had accepted as a wise\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThere was some foundation for the claim as appears from the testimony\r\nof General Grant, Mr. Seward, Mr. Stanton, and others, but there is no\r\nground for the claim that Mr. Lincoln had matured a plan or had\r\naccepted any scheme of reconstruction at the hands of any one.  In an\r\nexigency, as in the case of the resignation of General Hooker, he\r\ncould act immediately, but time and thought, and discussion with\r\nothers were accepted as valuable aids, whenever there was not a\r\npressure for instant action.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was examined in July, 1867, and the opening was conducted\r\nby Mr. Eldridge of Wisconsin.  It related to the parole granted to\r\nGeneral Lee and his army.  The nature of the questions led General\r\nGrant to make this remark:  \"I will state here, that I am not quite\r\ncertain whether I am being tried, or who is being tried, by the\r\nquestions asked.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant may have thought that Mr. Eldridge was endeavoring to\r\nsecure from him an admission that he had exceeded his authority in the\r\nterms of the parole granted to General Lee.  General Grant was able to\r\nstate the terms with exactness and within his powers as commander of\r\nthe conquering army.  He claimed that General Lee surrendered his\r\narmy \"in consideration of the fact that they were to be exempt from\r\ntrial so long as they conformed to the obligations which they had\r\ntaken.\"  President Johnson claimed that the leaders should be tried.\r\nThis position he abandoned previous to July, 1867.  Of an interview\r\nwith President Johnson, General Grant made this statement:\r\n\r\n\"He insisted on it that the leaders must be punished, and wanted to\r\nknow, when the time would come when those persons could be tried.  I\r\ntold him when they violated their parole.\"  In the opinion of General\r\nGrant the terms of the parole did not include Jefferson Davis, as he\r\nhad been captured.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the controversy President Johnson insisted that\r\nGeneral Lee should be tried for treason.  That purpose on the part of\r\nthe President was resisted by General Grant.  His position, in his own\r\nlanguage, was this:\r\n\r\n\"I insisted on it that General Lee would not have surrendered his army\r\nand given up all their arms if he had supposed that after surrender, he\r\nwas going to be tried for treason and hanged.  I thought we got a very\r\ngood equivalent for the lives of a few leaders in getting all those\r\narms and getting themselves under control bound by the oaths to obey\r\nthe laws.  That was the consideration, which I insisted upon, we had\r\nreceived.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant added:\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards he got to agreeing with me on that subject.\"\r\n\r\nOn the question of political rights as involved in the surrender and in\r\nthe parole, General Grant said:\r\n\r\n\"I never claimed that the parole gave those prisoners any political\r\nright whatever.  I thought that that was a matter entirely with\r\nCongress, over which I had no control, that simply as general-in-chief\r\ncommanding the army, I had a right to stipulate for the surrender on\r\nterms which protected their lives.  The parole gave them protection and\r\nexemption from punishment for all offences not in violation of the\r\nrules of civilized warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of difference between General Grant and President Johnson in\r\nregard to the parole is very clear from General Grant's answers to\r\nquestions by Mr. Thomas and Mr. Eldridge.\r\n\r\n\"You have stated your opinion as to the rights and privileges of\r\nGeneral Lee and his soldiers; do you mean that to include any political\r\nrights?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have explained that I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there any difference of opinion on that point between yourself and\r\nPresident Johnson at any time?\"\r\n\r\n\"On that point there was no difference of opinion; but there was as to\r\nwhether the parole gave them any privileges or rights . . . He claiming\r\nthat the time must come when they would be tried and punished, and I\r\nclaiming that that time could not come except by a violation of their\r\nparole.\"\r\n\r\nGrant claimed also that the army that had surrendered to Sherman came\r\nunder the same rules.\r\n\r\nThese quotations give General Grant's standing as an interpreter of\r\npublic law and as a leader capable of applying the rules and principles\r\nof public law to practical affairs.  His training at West Point may\r\nhave given him a knowledge of principles and his good sense enabled him\r\nto apply the principles in the terms that he dictated at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's natural qualities were such that with training he might\r\nhave succeeded in great causes involving principles, but he was not\r\nadapted to the ordinary business of a county-court lawyer.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain from the testimony of General Grant that Mr.\r\nLincoln had had in mind a scheme for the organization of the States\r\nthat had been in rebellion and that Mr. Johnson's proclamation for the\r\ngovernment of North Carolina was not a wide departure from that\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was present at two meetings of the Cabinet in Mr.\r\nLincoln's time, when a proclamation was read and considered.  In the\r\nlanguage of General Grant, \"after the assassination it continued right\r\nalong and I was there with Mr. Johnson.\"  General Grant's interest was\r\ndirected to two points:  First, that civil government should be set up\r\nbut subject to the final action of Congress, and second, that the\r\nparole should not be infringed.  He states his position thus:\r\n\r\n\"I was always ready to originate matters pertaining to the army, but I\r\nwas never willing to originate matters pertaining to the civil\r\ngovernment of the United States.  When I was asked my opinion about\r\nwhat had been done I was willing to give it.  I originated no plans and\r\nsuggested no plans for civil government.\"\r\n\r\nThe examination by Mr. Eldridge was in the nature of cross-examination\r\nand for the purpose of gaining an admission from General Grant that he\r\nhad advised or sanctioned President Johnson's plan of reconstruction.\r\nHence General Grant's declarations that his part was limited to the\r\nmilitary side of the measure and that in his view the entire plan was\r\nsubject to Congressional action.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's testimony is explicit upon these points:  He advised\r\nPresident Johnson to grant a pardon to General Lee and a pardon to\r\nGeneral Johnston.  He was especially urgent in favor of a pardon to\r\nGeneral Johnston in consideration of his speech to his army at the time\r\nof the surrender.  He advised against the proclamation of amnesty upon\r\nthe ground that the act was then premature.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's testimony adds strength to the statement that President\r\nJohnson contemplated the recognition of a Congress composed of\r\nDemocratic members from the North and of the representatives from the\r\nStates that had been organized under the President's proclamation.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard him say--and I think I have heard him say it twice in his\r\nspeeches--that if the North carried the election by members enough to\r\ngive them, with the Southern members, a majority why would they not be\r\nthe Congress of the United States?\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this question:  \"Have you heard him make a remark\r\nkindred to that elsewhere?\" General Grant said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have heard him say that aside from his speeches, in\r\nconversation.  I cannot say just when.\"\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina proclamation was read at an informal meeting at\r\nwhich only Grant and Stanton were with the President.  General Grant\r\ndid not criticise the paper.  He said of it:  \"It was a civil matter\r\nand although I was anxious to have something done I did not intend to\r\ndictate any plan.  I looked upon it simply as a temporary measure to\r\nestablish a sort of government until Congress should meet and settle\r\nthe whole question and that it did not make much difference how it was\r\ndone so there was a form of government there. . . . I don't suppose\r\nthat there were any persons engaged in that consultation who thought\r\nof what was being done at that time as being lasting--any longer than\r\nCongress would meet and either ratify that or establish some other\r\nform of government.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant understood that the North Carolina proclamation was in\r\nsubstance the paper which had been considered by Mr. Lincoln, but\r\nGeneral Grant said also, that Mr. Lincoln's plan was \"temporary, to be\r\neither confirmed, or a new government set up by Congress.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's testimony upon one point is supported by the testimony\r\nof Mr. Seward and the testimony of Mr. Stanton.  They agree that Mr.\r\nJohnson's plan of reconstruction was in substance the plan that Mr.\r\nLincoln had had under consideration.  Mr. Stanton regarded the plan as\r\ntemporary.\r\n\r\nIf President Johnson intended to enforce the plan upon the country he\r\nconcealed his purpose when the North Carolina proclamation was under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, 1866, the police commissioners of the city of\r\nBaltimore were engaged in the work of registering voters for the\r\nNovember elections, and the authorities were engaged in the work of\r\nregistering the voters in all parts of the State of Maryland.  It was\r\nclaimed that many thousands who had been engaged in the rebellion and\r\nwho were excluded under a provision of the Constitution had been\r\nregistered by the connivance of the authorities and especially by the\r\npolice commissioners of Baltimore.  There were rumors of secret,\r\nhostile organizations, there were threats of disturbance, and Governor\r\nSwann became alarmed.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson became alarmed also and under date of October 25 he\r\nwrote a letter to General Grant in which these paragraphs may be found:\r\n\r\n\"From recent development serious troubles are apprehended from a\r\nconflict of authority between the executive of the State of Maryland\r\nand the police commissioners of the city of Baltimore.\" . . . \"I\r\ntherefore request that you inform me of the number of Federal troops at\r\npresent stationed in the city of Baltimore and vicinity.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant informed the President on the 27th, that the number of\r\navailable and efficient troops was 1,550.  Thereupon, on the first day\r\nof November the President issued the following instruction to Secretary\r\nStanton:\r\n\r\n\"In view of the prevalence in various portions of the country of a\r\nrevolutionary and turbulent disposition which might at any moment\r\nassume insurrectionary proportions and lead to serious disorders, and\r\nof the duty of the government to be at all times prepared to act with\r\ndecision and effect this force is not deemed adequate for the\r\nprotection and security of the seat of government.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton referred the President's letter to General Grant with\r\ninstructions \"to take such measures as in his judgment are proper and\r\nwithin his power to carry into operation the within directions of the\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this order six or eight companies in New York and on the way to\r\njoin regiments in the South were detained at Fort McHenry, and a\r\nregiment in Washington was under orders to be ready to move upon notice.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of November the President qualified his demands in a\r\nletter to Secretary Stanton and limited the expression of anxiety to\r\nthe city of Baltimore.  It is certain that General Grant and Secretary\r\nStanton did not share the President's apprehensions and the day of\r\nelection passed without serious disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn the Philadelphia _Ledger_ of October 12, 1866, there appeared a\r\nseries of questions which were accompanied by the statement or the\r\nsuggestion that the President had submitted them to the Attorney-\r\nGeneral for an official opinion.  The questions related to the\r\nconstitutional validity of the Thirty-ninth Congress, and upon the\r\nground that all the States were not represented although hostilities\r\nhad ceased.\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony of Henry M. Flint, a newspaper correspondent, it\r\nappears that the President had no knowledge of the questions until\r\nafter the publications in the _Ledger_.  Flint's account of the affair\r\nmay be thus summarized.  For himself and without conference with the\r\nPresident, he reached the conclusion that the Thirty-ninth Congress was\r\nan illegal body and he had reached the conclusion also that the\r\nPresident entertained the same opinion.  Thereupon he assumed that the\r\nPresident would take the opinion of the Attorney-General.  Having\r\nadvanced thus far, he next proceeded to write the questions that he\r\nimagined the President would prepare and submit to the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nThese questions he transmitted to a brother correspondent in New York\r\n--Mr. F. A. Abbott--under cover of a letter which was not produced.\r\nFlint gave the substance of his letter to Abbott in these words:\r\n\r\n\"These questions are supposed or believed to have submitted by the\r\nPresident to the Attorney-General.\"  Speaking of Abbott, Flint said:\r\n\"I knew he was connected with several newspapers and I had no doubt\r\nwhen I sent these questions that they would appear in some paper in\r\nsome shape. . . . The object I had in view in writing these questions\r\nand in sending them to Mr. Abbott was that they might appear before the\r\npublic, and that the public mind might be directed to that point, and\r\nthat the newspapers particularly might be led to express their\r\nsentiments upon the questions involved in it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the publication \"had given rise to considerable discussion\" in the\r\nlanguage of Flint, \"I thought,\" he says, \"I ought to go the President\r\nand tell him what part of the despatch was mine and what connection I\r\nhad had with the publication of it.\"\r\n\r\nOf his interview with the President, he gives this report:  \"He showed\r\nme an article, which I think, appeared the day after the questions were\r\npublished, in the _Daily News_ of Philadelphia, which took pretty\r\nnearly the same ground my questions would indicate. . . . He spoke of\r\nit rather approvingly.\"\r\n\r\nFlint adds:  \"I had remarked to him:  'Mr. Johnson, it seemed to me\r\nthat it would be by no means remarkable that you should prepare such\r\nquestions as bear upon a subject which I know must have occupied your\r\nmind as it has the public mind.'  I forget what reply he made; it was\r\na sort of affirmative response or assent.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the origin of Flint's questions, their\r\nappearance in the manner indicated is an instance of volunteer service\r\nnot often paralleled in the rough contests of life.  Without any\r\neffort on his own part the President gained knowledge of a public\r\nsentiment upon the question of the legality of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress--a question in which he had much interest in the autumn of\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nThe project to increase the army around Washington and the project\r\nto proclaim the Thirty-ninth Congress an illegal body may have had an\r\nintimate connection with the project to send General Grant on a mission\r\nto Mexico and to place General Sherman in command at Washington, a\r\nproject of which I have spoken in another place.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ROBERT E. LEE\r\n\r\nGeneral Robert E. Lee was examined by the Committee on Reconstruction\r\nthe 17th day of February, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe inquiries related to the state of public sentiment in the South,\r\nand especially in Virginia with regard to secession, to the treatment\r\nof the negroes, to the public debts of the United States, and of the\r\nConfederacy, and to the treatment of Northern soldiers in Southern\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was then in good health and in personal appearance he\r\ncommended himself without delay.  He was large in frame, compactly\r\nbuilt, and he was furnished with all the flesh and muscle that could be\r\nuseful to a man who was passing the middle period of life.  The\r\nelasticity of spirits, the vigor of mind and body that are the wealth\r\nof a successful man at sixty were wanting in General Lee.  His\r\nappearance commanded respect and it excited the sympathy even of those\r\nwho had condemned his abandonment of the Union in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe examination gave evidence of integrity and of entire freedom from\r\nduplicity.  Freedom from duplicity was a controlling feature in General\r\nGrant's character and in that attribute of greatness Grant and Lee may\r\nhave been equals.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was free to disclose his own opinions, but he was cautious\r\nin his statements when questioned as to the opinions and purposes of\r\nthe men and States that had been in the Rebellion.  He was careful to\r\nsay at the beginning of the examination that he had no communication\r\nwith politicians and that he did not read the papers.  What he said of\r\nthe South assumed that the people were in poverty and were so dejected\r\nthat they had no plans for the future, nor any hopes of restoration to\r\nwealth, happiness and power in the affairs of the country.  His\r\ntestimony as a whole might justify the opinion that there would be no\r\nserious resistance to any form of government that might be set up.  He\r\nfavored the governments which President Johnson had organized and he\r\nexpressed the opinion that they were acceptable to the people\r\ngenerally.  A comprehensive statement was this:\r\n\r\n\"I do not know of a single person who either feels or contemplates\r\nany resistance to the government of the United States, or, indeed any\r\nopposition to it.\"  He gave this assurance to the committee:  \"The\r\npeople entirely acquiesce in the government of the United States and\r\nare for co-operating with President Johnson in his policy.\"\r\n\r\nThe payment of the public debt had not been a topic of discussion in\r\nhis presence, but the people were disposed to pay such taxes as were\r\nimposed and they were struggling to get money for that purpose.\r\n\r\nHe was of the opinion that the people made no distinction between the\r\nConfederate debt and the debt of the United States--that they were\r\ndisposed to pay both debts, and would pay both if they had the power.\r\nFor himself, however, he had no expectation that the indebtedness of\r\nthe Confederacy would ever be paid.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee manifested a kindly spirit for the freedmen, but he was\r\nunwilling to accept them as citizens endowed with the right of\r\nsuffrage.  Of the feeling in Virginia, General Lee said:  \"Every one\r\nwith whom I associate expresses kind feelings toward the freedmen.\r\nThey wish to see them get on in the world, and especially to take up\r\nsome occupation for a living.\"\r\n\r\nHe rejected the suggestion that there was anywhere within the State\r\nany combinations having in view, \"the disturbance of the peace, or any\r\nimproper or unlawful acts.\"  He characterized the negroes as \"an\r\namiable, social race, who look more to the present than to their\r\nfuture condition.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question whether the South would support the\r\ngovernment in case of a war with France or England, General Lee was\r\ndistinctly reserved:  \"I cannot speak with any certainty on that\r\npoint.  I do not know how far they might be actuated by their feelings.\r\nI have nothing whatever to base an opinion upon.  So far as I know\r\nthey contemplate nothing of the kind now.  What may happen in the\r\nfuture I cannot say.\"  He then added this remark:  \"Those people in\r\nVirginia with whom I associate express a hope that the country may not\r\nbe led into war.\"\r\n\r\nAs to an alliance during the war he said that he knew nothing of the\r\npolicy of the Confederate government:  \"I had no hand or part of it,\"\r\nwas his remark.  It was his opinion during the war that an alliance\r\nwith a foreign country was desirable, and he had assumed that the\r\nauthorities were of the same opinion.  His ideas were those of\r\nGeneral Grant, and he avoided responsibility for the measures of the\r\ngovernment on the civil side.\r\n\r\nWith kind feelings for the colored people of Virginia General Lee\r\nfavored the substitution of a white class of laborers, if an exchange\r\ncould be made, of which however, he had neither plan nor hope.  Nor\r\ncould he give any assurance that Northern men would be received upon\r\nterms of equality and friendship, if they avowed the opinions that\r\nthen prevailed generally in the North:  \"The manner in which they\r\nwould be received would depend entirely upon the individuals themselves\r\n--they might make themselves obnoxious, as you can understand,\" was the\r\nstatement of General Lee.  His testimony as a whole indicated an\r\nopinion that it was more important to secure capital for business, than\r\nit was to rid the State of the negro laborer.  In his opinion, most of\r\nthe blacks were willing to work for their former masters, but they were\r\nunwilling to make engagements for a year, a form of engagement which\r\nthe farmers and planters preferred, that they might be sure of help\r\nwhen it would be most needed.  The negroes may have been influenced by\r\none or both of two reasons.  Their unthrifty habits--the outcome of\r\nslavery--or an apprehension that a formal engagement for a year was a\r\nkind of bondage that might lead to a renewal of the old system.\r\n\r\nWhen General Lee was pressed by Senator Howard as to the feeling in the\r\nSouth in regard to the National Government, he said:  \"I believe that\r\nthey will perform all the duties that they are required to perform.  I\r\nthink that is the general feeling. . . . I do not know that there is\r\nany deep-seated dislike.  I think it is probable that there may be\r\nsome animosity still existing among some of the people of the South.\r\n. . . They were disappointed at the result of the war.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was of the opinion that a Southern jury would not find an\r\naccused guilty of treason for participation in the war.  Indeed his\r\ndoctrine of State Rights excused the citizen and placed the sole\r\nresponsibility on the State.  Of the common sentiment in the South he\r\nsaid:  \"So far as I know, they will look upon the action of the State,\r\nin withdrawing itself from the government of the United States, as\r\ncarrying the individuals of the State along with it; that the State\r\nwas responsible for the act, not the individual.\"  This was the\r\nframework of his own defence.  Speaking of the advocates of secession,\r\nhe said:  \"The ordinance of secession, or those acts of a State which\r\nrecognized a condition of war between the State and the General\r\nGovernment, stood as their justification for their bearing arms against\r\nthe Government of the United States.  They considered the act of the\r\nState as legitimate.  That they were merely using the reserved right,\r\nwhich they had a right to do.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these views General Lee was led to a specific statement of his\r\nown position:\r\n\r\nQuestion:  \"State, if you please, what your own personal views on that\r\nquestion were?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer:  \"That was my view; that the act of Virginia in withdrawing\r\nherself from the United States carried me along as a citizen of\r\nVirginia, and that her laws and her acts were binding on me.'\r\n\r\nQuestion:  \"And that you felt to be your justification in taking the\r\ncourse you did?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer:  \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the examination General Lee expressed the opinion that\r\nthe \"trouble was brought about by the politicians of the country.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee disclaimed all responsibility for the care and treatment of\r\nprisoners of war.  He had always favored a free exchange of prisoners,\r\nknowing that the proper means for the care and comfort of prisoners\r\ncould not be furnished in the Confederacy.  He thought that the\r\nhardships and neglects had been exaggerated.  As to himself, he had\r\nnever had any control over prisoners, except as they were captured on\r\nthe field of battle.  He sent his prisoners to Richmond where they came\r\nunder the command of the provost-marshal-general.  His orders to\r\nsurgeons on the field were to treat all the wounded alike.\r\n\r\nIn the examinations that were made by the committee I read a large\r\nnumber of reports of surgeons connected with the prisons and hospitals\r\nand I may say that in all cases they exhibited humanity and in many\r\ncases specific means of relief for the sufferings of the soldiers were\r\nrecommended.  Their reports were forwarded from officer to officer, but\r\nin a large majority of cases the reports were neglected.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by General Lee to his sister a few days before he\r\nabandoned the service of the United States, he expressed the opinion\r\nthat there was no sufficient cause for the rebellion.  This opinion, in\r\nconnection with his opinion that the rebellion was the work of\r\npoliticians demonstrates the power which the doctrine of State Rights\r\nhad obtained over a man of experience and of admitted ability.  Upon\r\nhis own admission, he subordinated his conduct to the action of his\r\nState, and in disregard of his personal obligation through his oath of\r\noffice.  If he had followed his own judgment as to what was wise and\r\nproper he would have remained in his place as an officer in the army of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIf in 1861 an officer of the army had entertained the opinion that the\r\nNorth was in the wrong and that the South was in the right, it could be\r\nclaimed, fairly, that that officer might forswear his obligations to\r\nthe old Government and accept service in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nMoral obliquity is not to be assumed in the case of General Lee.  His\r\npecuniary and professional interests must have invited him to remain\r\nin the army.  General Scott, a Virginian, was at the head of the army,\r\nand General Scott was his friend.  His promotion was certain, and\r\nimportant commands were probable.  His large estates in the vicinity of\r\nthe city of Washington were exposed to the ravages of war if not to\r\nconfiscation.  These sacrifices, some certain, and others probable were\r\npresent when he left Washington and entered into the service of the\r\nConfederacy under the superior authority of the State of Virginia in\r\ndisregard of his own opinion, and in disregard, not to say violation,\r\nof his oath as a soldier who had sworn to support the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.  General Lee was unable to say whether he had\r\ntaken an oath to support the Confederate States.  He could not recall\r\nthe fact of taking the oath, but he said he should have taken the oath\r\nif it had been tendered to him.\r\n\r\nThe full report of the testimony of General Lee should appear in any\r\ncomplete biography of the man.  It reveals his character, explains the\r\nleading influences to which he was subjected, and it sheds light upon\r\nthe state of public opinion in the South at the end of the contest in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott and General George H. Thomas were Virginians, but they\r\nacted in defiance of the State-Rights doctrines of the South.  In\r\nApril, 1861, General Scott gave me an account of the efforts that had\r\nbeen made to induce him to follow the fortunes of Virginia, and he\r\nspoke with a voice of emotion of his veneration for the flag, and of\r\nhis attachment to the Union.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS\r\n\r\nOf the soldiers of the Northern army in the war of the Rebellion,\r\nGeneral George H. Thomas takes rank next after the first three--Grant,\r\nSherman and Sheridan.  When Grant became President and Sherman was\r\ngeneral of the army the President was unwilling to appear to neglect\r\neither Sheridan or Thomas.  With high appreciation of Thomas as a\r\nsoldier, the President gave higher rank to Sheridan.  He said to me\r\nthat he placed Sheridan above every other officer of the war.  He gave\r\nSheridan credit for two supreme qualities--great care in his plans and\r\ngreat vigor in execution.\r\n\r\nYet, although the President acted upon a sound basis of opinion, the\r\nchoice left a painful impression upon his memory.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas and General Lee were alike in personal appearance, and\r\nthey resembled each other in their mental characteristics.  In one\r\nimportant particular they differed--General Thomas had no respect for\r\nState-Rights doctrines.  He was a native of Virginia, but there was no\r\nindication in his testimony, nor were there rumors, that he had ever\r\nhesitated in his course when the rebellion opened.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas was examined by the Committee on Reconstruction January\r\n29, and February 2, 1866.  He was then in command of the Military\r\nDivision of the Tennessee which included the States of Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.  It was the main object of\r\nthe committee to obtain information as to the public sentiment touching\r\nthe treatment of the negroes and the re-establishment of civil\r\ngovernment in the States that had been in rebellion.  The Union\r\nsentiment was stronger in Tennessee than in any other State of the\r\nConfederacy.  The inhabitants of the mountainous districts of eastern\r\nand middle Tennessee had been loyal from the opening of the contest in\r\n1860 and 1860.  Yet in 1866 General Thomas advised the committee that\r\nit would \"not be safe to remove the national troops from Tennessee, or\r\nto withdraw martial law; or to restore the writ of habeas corpus to\r\nits full extent.\"  At that time the peace of eastern Tennessee was\r\ndisturbed by family feuds and personal quarrels, the outcome of\r\npolitical differences.  In west Tennessee and in portions of middle\r\nTennessee there was a deep seated hostility to Union men, and\r\nespecially to Southern men who had served in the Union army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas said of them:  \"They are more unfriendly to Union men\r\nnatives of the State of Tennessee or of the South, who have been in\r\nthe Union army, than they are to men of Northern birth.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time the contract system of labor had been introduced, and the\r\ncontracts were regarded as binding both by whites and blacks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas advised the admission of Tennessee into the Union as a\r\nState, and his advice was acted upon favorably by its admission in the\r\nsummer of that year.  His recommendations were based upon the facts\r\nthat Tennessee had \"repudiated the rebel debt, had abolished slavery,\r\nhad adopted the Constitutional amendment upon that subject, had passed\r\na franchise law prohibiting from voting every man who had been\r\nengaged in the rebellion\" and had \"passed a law allowing negroes to\r\ntestify.\"\r\n\r\nHis opinion of the four other States of his command was not as\r\nfavorable.  \"I have received communications from various persons in the\r\nSouth that there was an understanding among the rebels and perhaps\r\norganizations formed or forming, for the purpose of gaining as many\r\nadvantages for themselves as possible; and I have heard it also\r\nintimated that these men are very anxious and would do all in their\r\npower to involve the United States in a foreign war, so that if a\r\nfavorable opportunity should occur, they might then again turn against\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of his first examination he gave this opinion as the result\r\nof his experience:\r\n\r\nQuestion:  \"In what could those advantages consist in breaking up the\r\ngovernment?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer:  \"They would wish to be recognized as citizens of the United\r\nStates, with the same rights they had before the war.\"\r\n\r\nQuestion:  \"How can they do that?  By wishing us in a war with England\r\nor France, in which they would take part against us?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer:  \"In that event their desire is to establish the Southern\r\nConfederacy.  They have not yet given up their desire for a separate\r\ngovernment, and if they have an opportunity to strike for it again they\r\nwill do so.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he knew of secret organizations he said that he had\r\nreceived several communications to that effect but the parties were\r\nunwilling to have their names made public.  He added:  \"The persons\r\ncommunicating with me are reliable and truthful and I believe their\r\nstatements are correct in the main.\r\n\r\n\"The nature and object of the organizations,\" he said, \"are the\r\nembarrassment of the Government of the United States in the proper\r\nadministration of the affairs of the county, and if possible, to\r\nrepudiate the national debt, or to gain such an ascendency in Congress\r\nas to make provision for the assumption by Congress of the debt\r\nincurred by the rebel government; also, in case the United States\r\nGovernment can be involved in a foreign war to watch their opportunity\r\nand take advantage of the first that comes to strike for the\r\nindependence of the States lately in rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from the testimony of General Thomas are a fair\r\nexposition of the condition of public sentiment in the Confederate\r\nStates with the exception in a degree of the border States.  It is\r\napparent also that General Thomas had not the degree of confidence in\r\nthe good purposes of those who had been in the rebellion that was\r\nentertained by Northern officers including Grant, Sherman and Sheridan.\r\n\r\nAs the loyal men of the South were greater sufferers from the war,\r\ntheir hostility was more intense against those who were responsible\r\nfor the war.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot say that Thomas was a great soldier in the large use of\r\nthe phrase, it can be said that he was a good soldier and that without\r\nqualifying words.  He should live in history as a true patriot and a\r\nman of the highest integrity.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY STANTON\r\n\r\nOf the men who occupied places in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, no one was\r\nmore free from just criticism affecting unfavorably the value of his\r\npublic services than Secretary Stanton.\r\n\r\nOf those who were nearest to him, no one ever received the impression\r\nfrom his acts or his conversation that he thought of the Presidency\r\nas a possibility under any circumstances.  Seward, Chase and Bates had\r\nbeen candidates at Chicago in 1860, and whatever may have been the\r\nfact in regard to Seward and Bates, it is quite certain that ambition\r\nfor the Presidency never lost its hold upon Mr. Chase, even when he\r\nbecame Chief Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nCoupled with the absence of ambition, or perhaps in a degree incident\r\nto the absence of ambition, Mr. Stanton was the possessor of courage\r\nfor all the emergencies of the place that he occupied--a courage that\r\nwas always available, whether in its exercise the wishes of individuals\r\nor the fortunes of the country were involved.\r\n\r\nIt was understood by those who frequented the War Office in the gloomy\r\ndays of 1862 and '63 that a card signed \"A. L.\" would not always\r\ncommand full respect from Secretary Stanton.  He was a believer in the\r\nrigid principles of the army, and although he was a humane man he\r\nsmothered or subdued his sympathy for heart-broken mothers whose sons\r\nhad deserted the cause of the country, in his determination to save\r\nthe country through the strictest enforcement of the rules and\r\nregulations of the army.  Mr. Lincoln, in his abounding good nature,\r\ncould not resist the appeals of disconsolate wives and heart-stricken\r\nmothers, and it was often Mr. Stanton's fortune to resist such appeals\r\neven when supported by the President's card in the form of a request\r\nwhich in ordinary times and upon ordinary men would be treated as an\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHence there may have been a foundation for the report that an\r\nunsuccessful user of one of the President's cards returned to the\r\nPresident for a reinforcement of the order.  The President insisted\r\nupon a full report of the Secretary's answer.  The applicant repeated\r\nthe Secretary's remark, which was not complimentary to the President's\r\ngood sense.  The President hesitated, and then declined to renew the\r\norder, saying:  \"Stanton is generally right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton's testimony was taken February 11, 1867, and on subsequent\r\ndays.  The record of the text and the accompanying documents cover more\r\nthan two hundred printed pages.  The evidence was taken by the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary, and it had special reference to the charges\r\nthat had been made against President Johnson.  At that time, the\r\nseparation between Mr. Stanton and the President had become\r\nirreconcilable, but there are no indications of hostility in the\r\nanswers given by the Secretary.  Indeed, he assumed, without reserve,\r\nfull responsibility for acts that had been charged on the President by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the railroads that fell within our lines were\r\nappropriated to the use of the United States, and heavy outlays had\r\nbeen made upon some of them for repairs and improvements.  In many\r\ncases expenses had been incurred, that in the hands of the corporation\r\nwould not have been chargeable to a construction account.  In a\r\nmajority of cases, if not in all, the roads had been surrendered\r\nwithout compensation, and the rolling stock had been transferred for\r\nvery slight consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton assumed the responsibility of the policy, upon the ground\r\nthat it was important to the South and to the country that the channels\r\nof commerce should be made available without delay and that the army\r\ncould not be used wisely in commercial traffic.  As the President was\r\ninterested in one of the railroads that received a large benefit by the\r\nrestoration of its property much improved, he was relieved of all\r\nresponsibility for a policy that had been much condemned.\r\n\r\nThrough the testimony of Secretary Stanton the committee was enabled\r\nto find the origin and to trace with a degree of accuracy the history\r\nof President Johnson's plan of reconstruction.  At a time not many days\r\nprior to Mr. Lincoln's death, Secretary Stanton prepared an order which\r\ncontained a _projet_ for the government of the States that had been in\r\nrebellion.  The paper was submitted to President Lincoln and it was\r\nconsidered by him in a cabinet meeting that was held during the day\r\npreceding the night of the assassination.\r\n\r\nAs this paper became the basis for the proclamations for the government\r\nof the States that had been in rebellion, its history, as given by\r\nMr. Stanton, is worthy of exact report in his own words:\r\n\r\n\"On the last day of Mr. Lincoln's life, there was a Cabinet meeting, at\r\nwhich General Grant, and all the members of the Cabinet, except Mr.\r\nSeward, were present.  General Grant at that time made a report of the\r\ncondition of the country, as he conceived it to be, and as it would be\r\non the surrender of Johnston's army, which was regarded as absolutely\r\ncertain.  The subject of reconstruction was talked of at considerable\r\nlength.  Shortly previous to that time I had myself, with a view of\r\nputting into a practicable form the means of overcoming what seemed to\r\nbe a difficulty in the mind of Mr. Lincoln, as to the mode of\r\nreconstruction, prepared a rough draft of a form or mode by which the\r\nauthority and laws of the United States should be re-established, and\r\ngovernments reorganized in the rebel States under the Federal\r\nauthority, without any necessity whatever for the intervention of\r\nrebel organizations or rebel aid.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that consultation Mr. Lincoln alluded to the paper,\r\nwent into his room, brought it out, and asked me to read it, which I\r\ndid, and explained my ideas in regard to it.  There was one point which\r\nI had left open; that was as to who should constitute the electors in\r\nthe respective States . . . I left a blank upon that subject to be\r\nconsidered.  There was at that time nothing adopted about it, and no\r\nopinions expressed; it was only a _projet_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the request of Mr. Lincoln and the Cabinet, the order was printed\r\nand a copy was given to each member, and a copy was given to Mr.\r\nJohnson when he had become President.\r\n\r\nThe plan was further considered in Mr. Johnson's Cabinet, and some\r\nalterations were made.  The point of chief difference related to the\r\nelective franchise--whether it should be extended to the negro race.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton said:  \"There was a difference of opinion upon that\r\nsubject.  The President expressed his views very clearly and\r\ndistinctly.  I expressed my views, and other members of the Cabinet\r\nexpressed their views.  The objection of the President to throwing\r\nthe franchise open to the colored people appeared to be fixed, and I\r\nthink every member of the Cabinet assented to the arrangement as it\r\nwas specified in the proclamation relative to North Carolina.  After\r\nthat I do not remember that the subject was ever again discussed in\r\nthe Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThus from Mr. Stanton's testimony we gather the important facts as to\r\nthe origin of a measure which became the subject of bitter controversy\r\nbetween President Johnson and the Republican Party.  The framework of\r\nthe North Carolina proclamation was furnished by Mr. Stanton.  When\r\nalterations had been made the proclamation was agreed to by the\r\nCabinet but without a declaration or even an understanding upon the\r\npoint which, without much delay, became the vital point:  was the\r\npolicy of government that was announced in the proclamation a permanent\r\npolicy or was it a temporary expedient, a substitute for military\r\ngovernment, and subject to the approval or disapproval of Congress?\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was of the opinion that the organizations which the\r\nPresident set up in the States were temporary and that they were\r\nsubject to the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton's opinion is expressed carefully, in his own words:  \"My\r\nopinion is, that the whole subject of reconstruction and the relation\r\nof the State to the Federal Government is subject to the controlling\r\npower of Congress; and while I believe that the President and his\r\nCabinet were not violating any law, but were faithfully performing\r\ntheir duty in endeavoring to organize provisional governments in\r\nthose States, I supposed then, and still suppose, that the final\r\nvalidity of such organizations would rest with the law-making power of\r\nthe government.\"\r\n\r\nIn an official letter, dated January 8, 1866, Secretary Stanton gave\r\nhis reasons for the payment of the salaries of the provisional\r\ngovernors:  \"The payments were made from the appropriation of army\r\ncontingencies because the duties performed by the parties were regarded\r\nof a temporary character ancillary to the withdrawal of military force,\r\nand to take the place of the armed forces in the respective States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the President chose to treat the governments that had\r\nbeen set up as permanent governments and beyond the control of\r\nCongress.  On this point, the contest between President Johnson and the\r\nRepublican Party was made up.  It ended in an appeal to the people, who\r\nrendered a judgment against _the President_ by a two-thirds majority.\r\nThe testimony of Secretary Seward, and official papers that were issued\r\nby the Department of State in the year 1865, may warrant the conclusion\r\nthat President Johnson was not then prepared to treat the new state\r\norganizations as final and binding upon Congress and the country.\r\n\r\nUnder date of July 8, 1865, Secretary Seward said, in an official\r\nletter to Governor Holden of North Carolina:  \"It is understood here\r\nthat besides cotton which has been taken by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury under Act of Congress there were quantities of resin, and\r\nother articles, as well as funds, lying about in different places in\r\nthe State and not reduced into possession by United States officers as\r\ninsurgent property.  The President is of the opinion that you can\r\nappropriate these for the inevitable and indispensable expenses of the\r\ncivil government of the State during the continuance of the provisional\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 14th day of November, 1865, Mr. McCulloch authorized Mr. Worth,\r\nacting as treasurer in North Carolina, to use the fragments of rebel\r\nproperty that might be gathered to defray the expenses of the\r\nprovisional government of the State.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question put to Secretary Seward, he said:  \"I do not\r\nremember that any provisional governor held a military office, except\r\nMr. Johnson.\"\r\n\r\nIn the further examination of Mr. Seward, May 16, 1867, he indicated\r\nhis concurrence with President Johnson in this remark:  \"The object was\r\nto proceed with the work of the restoration of the Union as speedily\r\nand effectively and wisely as possible, having no reference as to\r\nwhether Congress would be in session or not.\"\r\n\r\nThis question was put to Mr. Seward:\r\n\r\n\"Did not he (the President) urge these parties to be prepared to be at\r\nthe doors of Congress by the time of its next meeting?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was:  \"Very likely he did.  I do not know of the fact.  I\r\nknow that I was very anxious that these States should be represented\r\nin Congress, and that he was equally so, that they should be provided\r\nwith representatives who could be admitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy of the administration, July 24, 1865, is set forth in a\r\ndespatch from Secretary Seward to Governor Sharkey, of Mississippi (he\r\nis addressed as Provisional Governor):  \"The President sees no occasion\r\nto interfere with General Slocum's proceedings.  The government of the\r\nState will be provisional only until the civil authorities shall be\r\nrestored with the approval of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the united testimony of General Grant, Secretary Stanton and\r\nSecretary Seward, it may be claimed fairly that the governments that\r\nwere set up under proclamations of the President were treated in the\r\nbeginning as provisional governments and subject to the final judgment\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, when the rupture between Congress and the President had taken\r\nform, the President with the support of Mr. Seward announced the\r\ndoctrine that the governments which had been set up were valid\r\ngovernments, and that claimants for seats in Congress from those who\r\ncould prove their loyalty were entitled to admission.\r\n\r\nThus was a foundation laid for the impeachment of President Johnson by\r\nthe House of Representatives, and his trial by the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\nIMPEACHMENT OF ANDREW JOHNSON\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Andrew Johnson to the Vice-Presidency in 1864, by the\r\nRepublican Party, was a repetition of the error committed by the Whig\r\nParty in 1840, in the nomination of John Tyler for the same office.\r\n\r\nIn each case the nomination was due to an attempt to secure the support\r\nof a body of men who were not in accord in all essential particulars\r\nwith the party making the nomination.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler was opposed to the administration of Mr. Van Buren, but he\r\nwas opposed also to a national bank, which was then an accepted idea\r\nand an assured public policy of the Whig Party.  Hence, it happened\r\nthat when Mr. Tyler came to the Presidency, he resisted the attempt of\r\nCongress to establish a national bank, and by the exercise of the veto-\r\npower, on two occasions, he defeated the measure.  This controversy\r\ncaused the overthrow of the Whig Party, and it ended the contest in\r\nbehalf of a United States bank.\r\n\r\nIn the case of John Tyler and in the case of Andrew Johnson there was\r\nan application, in dangerous excess, of a policy that prevails in all\r\nnational conventions.  When the nomination of a candidate for the\r\nPresidency has been secured, the dominant wing of the party turns to\r\nthe minority with a tender of the Vice-Presidency.  In 1880, when the\r\nnomination of General Garfield had been made, the selection of a\r\ncandidate for the Vice-Presidency was tendered to the supporters of\r\nGeneral Grant, and it was declined by more than one person.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson never identified himself with the Republican Party; and\r\nneither in June, 1864, nor at any other period of his life, had the\r\nRepublican Party a right to treat him as an associate member.  He was,\r\nin fact, what he often proclaimed himself to be--a Jacksonian Democrat.\r\nHe was a Southern Union Democrat.  He was an opponent, and a bitter\r\nopponent, of the project for the dissolution of the Union, and a\r\nvindictive enemy of those who threatened its destruction.\r\n\r\nHis speeches in the Senate in the Thirty-sixth and the Thirty-seventh\r\nCongress were read and much approved throughout the North, and they\r\nprepared the way for the acceptance of his nomination as a candidate\r\nof the Republican Party in 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was an earnest supporter of the Crittenden Compromise.\r\nThat measure originated in the House of Representatives.  It was\r\ndefeated in the Senate by seven votes and six votes of the seven came\r\nfrom the South.  The provisions of the bill were far away from the\r\nideals of Republicans generally, although the measure was sustained\r\nby members of the party.  By that scheme the Fugitive Slave Law was\r\nmade less offensive in two particulars, but the United States was to\r\npay for fugitives from slavery whenever a marshal failed to perform his\r\nduty.  As an important limitation of the powers of Congress, the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia was to be dependent\r\nupon the consent of the States of Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson gave voice to his indignation when he spoke of the Southern\r\nmen whose votes contributed to the defeat of the Crittenden Compromise.\r\n\"Who, then,\" said he, \"has brought these evils upon the country?  Whose\r\nfault is it?  Who is responsible for it?  With the help we had from the\r\nother side of the chamber, if all those on this side had been true to\r\nthe Constitution and faithful to their constituents, and had acted with\r\nfidelity to the country, the amendment of the Senator from New\r\nHampshire could have been voted down.  Whose fault was it?  Who did it?\r\nSouthern traitors, as was said in the speech of the Senator from\r\nCalifornia.  They did it.  They wanted no compromise.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts show the style of speech in which Mr. Johnson indulged,\r\nand they prove beyond question that in the winter of 1861 he had no\r\nsympathy with the Republican Party of 1856 and 1860.  These facts\r\nexplain, and in some measure they palliate, the peculiarities of his\r\ncareer, which provoked criticism and an adverse popular judgment when\r\nhe came to the Presidency.  Nor is there evidence within my knowledge\r\nthat he ever denied the right of secession.  However that may have\r\nbeen, he disapproved of the exercise of the right at all stages of the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nIn the Thirty-sixth Congress Mr. Johnson proposed amendments to the\r\nConstitution which gave him consideration in the North.  By his\r\nproposition the Fugitive Slave Law was to be repealed, and in its place\r\nthe respective States were to return fugitives or to pay the value of\r\nthose that might be retained.\r\n\r\nSlavery was to be abolished in the District of Columbia with the\r\nconsent of Maryland and upon payment of the full value of the slaves\r\nemancipated.  The Territories were to be divided between freedom and\r\nslavery.  His scheme contemplated other changes not connected\r\nnecessarily with the system of slavery.  Of these I mention the\r\nelection of President, Vice-President, Senators, and Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court by the people, coupled with a limitation of the terms of\r\njudges to twelve years.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden Resolution contained these declarations of facts and\r\npolicy:\r\n\r\n1.  The present deplorable war has been forced upon the country by the\r\ndisunionists of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n2.  Congress has no purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of\r\noverthrowing or interfering with the established rights of those States.\r\n\r\nUpon a motion to include disunionists in the North under the first\r\ncharge, Mr. Johnson voted in the negative with Sumner, Wilson, Wade,\r\nand other Republicans.\r\n\r\nThis brief survey of Mr. Johnson's Congressional career at the opening\r\nof the war may indicate the characteristics of his mind in controversy\r\nand debate, and furnish means for comprehending his actions in the\r\ntroublous period of his administration.\r\n\r\nSome conclusions are deducible from this survey.  First of all it is\r\nto be said that he never assumed to be a member of the Republican\r\nParty.  Next, I do not find evidence which will justify the statement\r\nthat he was a disbeliever in the right of a State to secede from the\r\nUnion.  It is manifest that he was not an advocate of the doctrine of\r\npolitical equality as it came to be taught by the leaders of the\r\nRepublican Party.  When he became President, he was an opponent of\r\nnegro suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis record, though not concealed, was not understood by the members\r\nof the convention that placed him in nomination for the second office\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nThis analysis prepares the way for an extract from the testimony of Mr.\r\nStanley Matthews, who was afterwards a justice of the Supreme Court,\r\nand who was examined by the Judiciary Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives when engaged in investigating the doings of the\r\nPresident previous to his impeachment.  Mr. Johnson was appointed\r\nMilitary Governor of Tennessee the third day of March, 1862.  Colonel\r\nMatthews was provost-marshal at Nashville, where Johnson resided during\r\nhis term as Governor.  In that term Matthews and Johnson became\r\nacquainted.  When Johnson was on his way to Washington to take the oath\r\nof office, he stopped at the Burnet House in Cincinnati.  Matthews\r\ncalled upon him.  Matthews had been a Democrat until the troubles in\r\nKansas.  In the conversation at the Burnet House Mr. Johnson made these\r\nremarks, after some personal matters had been disposed of.  I quote\r\nfrom the testimony of Judge Matthews:\r\n\r\n\"I inquired as to the state of public feeling on political matters in\r\nTennessee at that time.  He remarked that very great changes had\r\ntaken place since I had been there, that many of those who at first\r\nwere the best Union men had turned to be the worst rebels, and that\r\nmany of those who had originally been the worst rebels were now the\r\nbest Union men.  I expressed surprise and regret at what he said in\r\nreference to the matter.\r\n\r\n\"We were sitting near each other on the sofa.  He then turned to me and\r\nsaid, 'You and I were old Democrats.'  I said, 'Yes.'  He then said,\r\n_'I will tell you what it is, if the country is ever to be saved, it is\r\nto be done through the old Democratic Party.'_\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether I made any reply to that, or, if I did, what it\r\nwas; and immediately afterwards I took my leave.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger part of this quotation is only important as leading up to\r\nthe phrase that is emphasized, and which may throw light upon Mr.\r\nJohnson's policy and conduct when he came to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThis conversation occurred in the month of February, 1865, and it must\r\nbe accepted as evidence, quite conclusive, that Mr. Johnson was then\r\nopposed to the policy of the Republican Party, whose honors he had\r\naccepted.  In a party sense Mr. Johnson was not a Republican: he was a\r\nUnion Democrat.  He was opposed to the dissolution of the Union, but\r\nnot necessarily upon the ground that the Union had a supreme right to\r\nexist in defiance of what is called \"State sovereignty.\"  This with\r\nthe Republican Party was a fundamental principle.  Under the influence\r\nof the principles of the old Democratic Party Mr. Johnson advanced to\r\nthe Vice-Presidency, and while under the influence of the same idea he\r\nbecame President.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican Party came to power, the State of Maryland, that\r\nportion of Virginia now known as West Virginia, the State of Kentucky,\r\nand the State of Missouri were largely under the influence of\r\nsympathizers with the eleven seceding States of the South.  It was\r\nnecessary in Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri to maintain the\r\nascendency of the National Government by the exhibition of physical\r\nforce, and in some instances by its actual exercise.  Mr. Lincoln's\r\npolicy in regard to the question of slavery was controlled, up to the\r\nmonth of July, 1862, by the purpose to conciliate Union slave-holders\r\nin the States mentioned.  Of his measures I refer to the proposition\r\nto transfer the free negroes to Central America, for which an\r\nappropriation of $25,000 was made by Congress.  Next, Congress passed\r\nan act for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia upon\r\nthe payment of three hundred dollars for each slave emancipated.\r\n\r\nWithout representing in his history or in his person the slave-holding\r\ninterests of the South, Mr. Johnson was yet a Southern man with Union\r\nsentiments.  The impression was received therefrom that his influence\r\nwould be considerable in restraining, if not in conciliating slave-\r\nholders in what were called the \"border States.\"  These facts tended\r\nto his nomination for the Vice-Presidency.  I have no means for\r\nforming an opinion that is trustworthy as to the position of Mr.\r\nLincoln in reference to the nomination of Mr. Johnson.  His nomination\r\nmay justify the impression that the Republican Party was in doubt as to\r\nits ability to re-elect Mr. Lincoln in 1864.  From the month of July,\r\n1862, to the nomination in 1864, I had frequent interviews with Mr.\r\nLincoln, and I can only say that, during the period when the result of\r\nthe election was a subject of thought, he gave no intimation in the\r\nconversations that I had with him that the element of doubt as to the\r\nresult existed in his mind.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, the inference may be drawn that Mr. Johnson\r\ncame to the Vice-Presidency in the absence of any considerable degree\r\nof confidence on the part of the Republican Party, although there were\r\nno manifestations of serious doubt as to his fitness for the place, or\r\nas to his fidelity to the principles of the party.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of the inauguration of Mr. Johnson in the Senate Chamber,\r\nand especially his speech on the occasion, which was directed,\r\napparently, to the diplomatic corps, excited apprehensions in those\r\nwho were present, and the confidence of the country was diminished\r\nmaterially concerning his qualifications for the office to which he had\r\nbeen elected.  Without delay these apprehensions circulated widely, and\r\nthey were deepened in the public mind by the assassination of Mr.\r\nLincoln and the elevation of Mr. Johnson to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe public confidence received a further serious shock by his\r\nproclamation of May 29, 1865, for the organization of a State\r\ngovernment in North Carolina.  That proclamation contained provisions\r\nin harmony with what has been set forth in this paper concerning the\r\npolitical principles of Mr. Johnson.  First of all, he limited the\r\nfranchise to persons \"qualified as prescribed by the constitution and\r\nlaws of the State of North Carolina in force immediately before the\r\n20th day of May, 1861, the date of the so-called Ordinance of\r\nSecession.\"  This provision was a limitation of the suffrage, and it\r\nexcluded necessarily the negro population of the State.  It was also a\r\nrecognition of the right of the State to reappear as a State in the\r\nUnion.  It was, indeed, an early assertion of the phrase which\r\nafterwards became controlling with many persons--\"Once a State, always\r\na State.\"  He further recognized the right of the State to reappear as\r\na State in the organization and powers of the convention which was to\r\nbe called under the proclamation.  As to that he said:  \"The convention\r\nwhen convened, or the legislature which may be thereafter assembled,\r\nwill prescribe the qualification of electors and the eligibility of\r\npersons to hold office under the constitution and laws of the State,\r\na power the people of the several States composing the Union have\r\nrightfully exercised from the origin of the Government to the present\r\ntime.\"  There were further instructions given in the proclamation as to\r\nthe duties of various officers of the United States to aid Governor\r\nHolden, who, by the same proclamation, was appointed \"Provisional\r\nGovernor of the State of North Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the publication of this proclamation I was so much disturbed that\r\nI proceeded at once to Washington, but without any definite idea as to\r\nwhat could be done to arrest the step which seemed to me a dangerous\r\nstep towards the re-organization of the Government upon an unsound\r\nbasis.  At that time I had had no conversation with Mr. Johnson, either\r\nbefore or after he came to the Presidency, upon any subject whatever.\r\nThe interview which I secured upon that visit was the sole personal\r\ninterview that ever occurred between us.  I called upon Senator Morrill\r\nof Vermont, and together we made a visit to the President.  I spoke of\r\nthe features of the proclamation that seemed to be objectionable.  He\r\nsaid that \"the measure was tentative\" only, and that until the\r\nexperiment had been tried no other proclamation would be issued.  Upon\r\nthat I said in substance that the Republican Party might accept the\r\nproclamation as an experiment, but that it was contrary to the ideas\r\nof the party, and that a continuance of the policy would work a\r\ndisruption of the party.  He assured us that nothing further would be\r\ndone until the experiment had been tested.  With that assurance we left\r\nthe Executive Mansion.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th day of June, 1865, a similar proclamation was issued in\r\nreference to the State of Mississippi, and on the 17th of June,\r\ncorresponding proclamations were issued in reference to the States of\r\nGeorgia, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Florida.  In each State a\r\nperson was named as Provisional Governor.  This action led to a\r\ndivision of the party and to its subsequent reorganization against the\r\nPresident's policy.\r\n\r\nIn his letter of acceptance of the nomination made by the Union\r\nConvention, Mr. Johnson endorsed, without reserve, the platform that\r\nhad been adopted.  The declarations of the platform did not contain a\r\nreference to the reorganization of the Government in the event of the\r\nsuccess of the Union arms.  The declarations were enumerated in this\r\norder:  the Union was to be maintained; the war was to be prosecuted\r\nupon the basis of an unconditional surrender of the rebels; and\r\nslavery, as the cause of the war, was to be abolished.  The added\r\nresolutions related to the services of the soldiers and sailors, and to\r\nthe policy of Abraham Lincoln as President.  It was further declared\r\nthat the public credit should be maintained, that there should be a\r\nvigorous and just system of taxes, and that the people would view with\r\n\"extreme jealousy,\" and as enemies to the peace and independence of\r\nthe country, the efforts of any power to obtain new footholds for\r\nmonarchical government on this continent.  Such being the character of\r\nthe platform, it cannot be said that Mr. Johnson challenged its\r\ndeclarations in the policy on which he entered for the reorganization\r\nof the Government.  In Mr. Johnson's letter of acceptance he preserved\r\nhis relations to the Democrats by the use of this phrase:  \"I cannot\r\nforego the opportunity of saying to my old friends of the Democratic\r\nParty proper, with whom I have so long and pleasantly been associated,\r\nthat the hour has come when that great party can justly indicate its\r\ndevotion to the Democratic policy in measures of expediency.\"\r\n\r\nThe controversy with Mr. Johnson had its origin in the difference of\r\nopinion as to the nature of the Government.  That difference led him to\r\nthe conclusion that the rebellion had not worked any change in the\r\nlegal relations of the seceding States to the National Government.  His\r\nmotto was this:  \"Once a State, always a State,\" whatever might be its\r\nconduct either of peace or war.  There were, however, differences of\r\nopinion among those who adhered to the Republican Party.  Mr. Stevens,\r\nwho was a recognized, if not the recognized, leader of the Republican\r\nParty, advocated the doctrine that the eleven States were to be treated\r\nas enemy's territory, and to be governed upon whatever system might be\r\nacceptable to the States that had remained true to the Union.  Mr.\r\nSumner maintained the doctrine that the eleven States were Territories,\r\nand that they were to be subject to the General Government until\r\nCongress should admit the several Territories as State organizations.\r\nThe fourth day of May, 1864, I presented a series of resolutions in\r\nthe House of Representatives, in which I asserted this doctrine:  The\r\ncommunities that have been in rebellion can be organized into States\r\nonly by the will of the loyal people expressed freely and in the\r\nabsence of all coercion; that States so organized can become States of\r\nthe American Union only when they shall have applied for admission and\r\ntheir admission shall have been authorized by the existing National\r\nGovernment.  A small number of persons who were identified with the\r\nRepublican Party sustained the policy of Mr. Johnson.  Others were of\r\nthe opinion that the eleven States were out of their proper relation to\r\nthe Union, as was declared by Mr. Lincoln in his last speech, and that\r\nthey could become members of the American Union only by the organized\r\naction of each, and the concurrent action of the existing National\r\nGovernment.  The Government was reorganized without any distinct\r\ndeclaration upon the question whether the States that had been in\r\nrebellion were to be treated as enemy's territory, or as Territories\r\naccording to the usage of former times.  The difference of opinion was\r\na vital one with Mr. Johnson.  Whatever view may be taken of his moral\r\nqualities, it is to be said that he was not deficient in intellectual\r\nability, that his courage passed far beyond the line of obstinacy, and\r\nthat from the first to last he was prepared to resist the claims of\r\nthe large majority of the Republican Party.  The issue began with his\r\nproclamation of May, 1865, and the contest continued to the end of his\r\nterm.  The nature of the issue explains the character and violence of\r\nhis speeches, especially that of the twenty-second day of February,\r\n1866, when he spoke of Congress as a \"body hanging on the verge of the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the many speeches which he delivered in his trip through the West,\r\nhe made distinct charges against Congress.  He was accompanied by Mr.\r\nSeward, General Grant, Admiral Farragut, and some others.  In a speech\r\nat Cleveland, Ohio, he said, among other things, \"I have called upon\r\nyour Congress, which has tried to break up the Government.\"  Again, in\r\nthe same speech he said, \"I tell you my countrymen, that although the\r\npowers of Thad Stevens and his gang were by, they could not turn me\r\nfrom my purpose.  There is no power that can turn me, except you and\r\nthe God who put me into existence.\"  He charged, also, that Congress\r\nhad taken great pains to poison their constituents against him.  \"What\r\nhad Congress done?  Had they done anything to restore the Union in\r\nthose States?  No; on the contrary, they had done everything to prevent\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIn a speech made at St. Louis, Missouri, September 8, 1866, Mr. Johnson\r\ndiscussed the riot at New Orleans.*  In that speech he said, \"If you\r\nwill take up the riot in New Orleans, and trace it back to its source,\r\nor its immediate cause, you will find out who was responsible for the\r\nblood that was shed there.  If you will take up the riot at New\r\nOrleans and trace it back to the radical Congress, you will find that\r\nthe riot at New Orleans was substantially planned.\"  After some\r\nfurther observations, he says:  \"Yes, you will find that another\r\nrebellion was commenced, having its origin in the radical Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from Mr. Johnson's speeches should be considered in\r\nconnection with his proclamations of May, June, and July, 1865.  They\r\nare conclusive to this point:  that he had determined to reconstruct\r\nthe Government upon the basis of the return of the States that had been\r\nengaged in the rebellion without the imposition of any conditions\r\nwhatsoever, except such as he had imposed upon them in his\r\nproclamations.  In fine, that the Government was to be re-established\r\nwithout the authority or even the assent of the Congress of the United\r\nStates.  In his proclamations he made provision for the framing of\r\nconstitutions in the respective States, their ratification by the\r\npeople, excluding all those who were not voters in April, 1861, and for\r\nthe election of Senators and Representatives to the Congress of the\r\nUnited States without the assent of the Representatives of the existing\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Washington to attend the meeting of Congress at the\r\nDecember session, 1866, I received a note from Mr. Stanton asking me to\r\nmeet him at the War Office with as little delay as might be\r\npracticable.  When I called at the War Office, he beckoned me to retire\r\nto his private room, where he soon met me.  He then said that he had\r\nbeen more disturbed by the condition of affairs in the preceding weeks\r\nand months than he had been at any time during the war.  He gave me to\r\nunderstand that orders had been issued to the army of which neither he\r\nnor General Grant had any knowledge.  He further gave me to understand\r\nalso that he apprehended an attempt by the President to re-organize the\r\nGovernment by the assembling of a Congress in which the members from\r\nthe seceding States and the Democratic members from the North might\r\nobtain control through the aid of the Executive.  He then said that he\r\nthought it necessary that some act should be passed by which the power\r\nof the President might be limited.  Under his dictation, and after such\r\nconsultation as seemed to be required, I drafted amendments to the\r\nAppropriation Bill for the Support of the Army, which contained the\r\nfollowing provisions:  The headquarters of the General of the Army were\r\nfixed at Washington, where he was to remain unless transferred to duty\r\nelsewhere by his own consent or by the consent of the Senate.  Next, it\r\nwas made a misdemeanor for the President to transmit orders to any\r\nofficer of the army except through the General of the Army.  It was\r\nalso made a misdemeanor for any officer to obey orders issued in any\r\nother way than through the General of the Army, knowing that the same\r\nhad been so issued.  These provisions were taken by me to Mr. Stevens,\r\nthe chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.  After some\r\nexplanation, the measure was accepted by the committee and incorporated\r\nin the Army Appropriation Bill.  The bill was approved by the President\r\nthe second day of March, 1867.  His approval was accompanied by a\r\nprotest on his part that the provision was unconstitutional, and by the\r\nstatement that he approved the bill only because it was necessary for\r\nthe support of the army.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my interview with Mr. Stanton, I was not informed fully\r\nas to the events that had transpired in the preceding months, nor can\r\nI say now that everything which had transpired of importance was then\r\nknown to Mr. Stanton.  The statement that I am now to make was derived\r\nfrom conversations with General Grant.  At a time previous to the\r\nDecember session of 1866, the President said to General Grant, \"I may\r\nwish to send you on a mission to Mexico.\"  General Grant replied, \"It\r\nmay not be convenient for me to go to Mexico.\"  Little, if anything,\r\nfurther was said between the President and General Grant.  At a\r\nsubsequent time General Grant was invited to a Cabinet meeting.  At\r\nthat meeting Mr. Seward read a paper of instruction to General Grant\r\nas Minister of some degree to Mexico.  The contents of the paper did\r\nnot impress General Grant very seriously, for in the communication that\r\nhe made to me he said that \"the instructions came out very near where\r\nthey went in.\"  At the end of the reading General Grant said, \"You\r\nrecollect, Mr. President, I said it would not be convenient for me to\r\ngo to Mexico.\"  Upon that a conversation followed, when the President\r\nbecame heated, and rising from his seat, and striking the table with\r\nsome force, he said \"Is there an officer of the army who will not\r\nobey my instructions?\"  General Grant took his hat in his hand, and\r\nsaid, \"I am an officer of the army, but I am a citizen also; and this\r\nis a civil service that you require of me.  I decline it.\"  He then\r\nleft the meeting.  It happened also that previous to this conversation\r\nthe President had ordered General Sherman, who was in command at Fort\r\nLeavenworth, to report at Washington.  General Sherman obeyed the\r\norder, came to Washington, and had a conference with General Grant\r\nbefore he reported to the President.  In that situation of affairs\r\nGeneral Sherman was sent to Mexico upon the mission which had been\r\nprepared for General Grant.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that Mr. Johnson contemplated the re-organization of the\r\nGovernment by the admission of the States that had been in rebellion,\r\nand by the recognition of Senators and Representatives that might be\r\nassigned from those States, received support from the testimony given\r\nby Major-General William H. Emory, and also from the testimony of\r\nGeneral Grant.  In the latter part of the year 1867 and the first part\r\nof the year 1868, General Emory was in command of the Department of\r\nWashington.  When he entered upon the command, he called upon the\r\nPresident.  A conversation, apparently not very important, occurred\r\nbetween them, as to the military forces then in that department.  In\r\nFebruary, 1868, the President directed his secretary to ask General\r\nEmory to call upon him as early as practicable.  In obedience to that\r\nrequest General Emory called on the twenty-second day of February.  The\r\nPresident referred to the former conversation, and then inquired\r\nwhether any changes had been made, and especially within the recent\r\ndays, in the military forces under Emory's command.  In the course of\r\nthe conversation growing out of these requests for information, General\r\nEmory referred to an order which had then been recently issued which\r\nembodied the provisions of the act of March, 1867, in regard to the\r\ncommand of the army and the transmission of orders.  The President\r\nthen said to Emory:\r\n\r\n\"What order do you refer to?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply Emory said:  \"Order No. 17 of the Series of 1867.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was produced and read by the President, who said:\r\n\r\n\"This is not in conformity with the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthat makes me commander-in-chief, or with the terms of your commission.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory said:  \"That is the order which you have approved and\r\nissued to the army for our government.\"\r\n\r\nThe President then said:  \"Am I to understand that the President of the\r\nUnited States cannot give an order except through the head of the army,\r\nor General Grant?\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conversation, General Emory informed the President\r\nthat eminent lawyers had been consulted, that he had consulted Robert\r\nJ. Walker, and that all of the lawyers consulted had expressed the\r\nopinion that the officers of the army were bound by the order whether\r\nthe statute was constitutional or unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant was before the Judiciary Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives during the impeachment investigation, this question\r\nwas put to him:\r\n\r\n\"Have you at any time heard the President make any remark in regard\r\nto the admission of members of Congress from rebel States in either\r\nHouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say positively what I have heard him say.  I have heard him\r\nsay as much in his public speeches as anywhere else.  I have heard him\r\nsay twice in his speeches that if the North carried the election by\r\nmembers enough to give them, with the Southern members, the majority,\r\nwhy should they not be the Congress of the United States?  I have\r\nheard him say that several times.\"\r\n\r\nThat answer was followed by this question:\r\n\r\n\"When you say the North, you mean the Democratic Party of the North,\r\nor, in other words, the party advocating his policy?\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant replied:\r\n\r\n\"I meant if the North carried enough members in favor of the admission\r\nof the South.  I did not hear him say that he would recognize them as\r\nthe Congress, I merely heard him ask the question, 'Why would they not\r\nbe the Congress?'\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, and without further discussion of the purpose of Mr.\r\nJohnson in regard to the reorganization of the Government, I think it\r\nmay be stated without injustice to him, that while he was opposed to\r\nsecession at the time the Confederate Government was organized, and\r\nthenceforward and always without change of opinion, yet he was also\r\nof opinion that the act of secession by the several States had not\r\ndisturbed their legal relations to the National Government.  Acting\r\nupon that opinion, he proceeded to reorganize the State governments,\r\nand with the purpose of securing the admission of their Senators and\r\nRepresentatives without seeking or accepting the judgment of Congress\r\nupon the questions involved in the proceeding.  On one vital point he\r\nerred seriously and fundamentally as to the authority of the President\r\nin the matter.  From the nature of our Government there could be no\r\nescape in a legal point of view from the conclusion that, whatever the\r\nrelations were of the seceding States to the General Government, the\r\nmethod of restoration was to be ascertained and determined by Congress,\r\nand not by the President acting as the chief executive authority of the\r\nnation.  In a legal and constitutional view, that act on his part,\r\nalthough resting upon opinions which he had long entertained, and which\r\nwere entertained by many others, must be treated as an act of usurpation.\r\n\r\nThe facts embodied in the charges on which Mr. Johnson was impeached\r\nby the House and arraigned before the Senate were not open to doubt,\r\nbut legal proof was wanting in regard to the exact language of his\r\nspeeches.  The charges were in substance these:  That he had attacked\r\nthe integrity and the lawful authority of the Congress of the United\r\nStates in public speeches made in the presence of the country.  The\r\nsecond charge was that he had attempted the removal of Mr. Stanton\r\nfrom the office of Secretary of War, and that, without the concurrence\r\nof the Senate, he had so removed him, contrary to the act of Congress,\r\nknown as the Tenure of Office Act.  In the first investigation into\r\nthe conduct of Andrew Johnson, he was described in the resolution as\r\n\"Vice-President of the United States, discharging at present the duties\r\nof President of the United States.\"  The resolution was adopted by the\r\nHouse of Representatives the seventh day of March, 1867.  A large\r\namount of testimony was taken, and the report of the committee, in\r\nthree parts, by the different members, was submitted to the House the\r\nfourth day of the following December.  The majority of the committee,\r\nconsisting of George S. Boutwell, Francis Thomas, Thomas Williams,\r\nWilliam Lawrence, and John C. Churchill, reported a resolution\r\nproviding for the impeachment of the President of the United States,\r\nin these words:  \"Resolved, that Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.\"  It will\r\nbe observed that in the resolution for his impeachment he is described\r\nas \"President of the United States,\" while in the resolution\r\nauthorizing the inquiry into his conduct he is described as \"Vice-\r\nPresident, discharging at present the duties of the President of the\r\nUnited States.\"  This question received very careful consideration by\r\nthe committee, and the conclusion was reached that he was the President\r\nof the United States, although he had been elected only to the office\r\nof Vice-President.  As that question was not raised at the trial by\r\ndemurrer or motion, it may now be accepted as the established doctrine\r\nthat the Vice-President, when he enters upon the duties of President,\r\nbecomes President of the United States.  The extended report that was\r\nmade by the majority of the committee was written by Mr. Williams.\r\nThe summary, which was in the nature of charges, was written by myself.\r\nThat summary set forth twenty-eight specifications of misconduct on the\r\npart of the President, many of which, however, where abandoned when the\r\narticles of impeachment were prepared in February, 1868.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the committee there were serious differences of\r\nopinion upon provisions of law.  The minority of the committee,\r\nconsisting of James F. Wilson, who was chairman of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, Frederick E. Woodbridge, S. S. Marshall, and Charles R.\r\nEldridge, maintained the doctrine that a civil officer under the\r\nConstitution of the United States was not liable to impeachment except\r\nfor the commission of an indictable offence.  This doctrine had very\r\nlarge support in the legal profession, resting on remarks found in\r\nBlackstone.  On the other hand, Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries,\r\nhad given support to the doctrine that a civil officer was liable to\r\nimpeachment who misdemeaned himself in office.  The provision of the\r\nConstitution is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"The President, Vice-President, and all Civil Officers of the United\r\nStates shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction\r\nof, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Judiciary Committee, in the controversy which\r\narose in the committee and in the House of Representatives, maintained\r\nthat the word \"misdemeanors\" was used in a political sense, and not in\r\nthe sense in which it is used in criminal law.  In support of this\r\nview attention was called to the fact that the party convicted was\r\nliable only to removal from office, and therefore that the object of\r\nthe process of impeachment was the purification and preservation of the\r\ncivil service.  In the opinion of the majority, it was the necessity of\r\nthe situation that the power of impeachment should extend to acts and\r\noffences that were not indictable by statute nor at common law.  The\r\nreport of the Judiciary Committee, made the twenty-fifth day of\r\nNovember, was rejected by the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of the President to remove Mr. Stanton from the office of\r\nSecretary for the Department of War revived the question of\r\nimpeachment, and on Monday, the twenty-fourth day of February, 1868,\r\nthe House of Representatives \"resolved to impeach Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors.\"  The\r\narticles of impeachment were acted on by the House of Representatives\r\nthe second day of March, and on the fourth day of March they were\r\npresented to the Senate through Mr. Bingham, chairman of the managers,\r\nwho was designated for that duty.\r\n\r\nThe articles were directed to the following points, namely:  That the\r\nPresident, by his speeches, had attempted \"to set aside the rightful\r\nauthority and powers of Congress\"; that he had attempted \"to bring\r\ninto disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach the Congress of\r\nthe United States and the several branches thereof\"; and \"that he had\r\nattempted to incite the odium and resentment of all the good people of\r\nthe United States against Congress and the laws by them duly and\r\nconstitutionally enacted.\"  Further, it was alleged that he had\r\ndeclared in speeches that the \"Thirty-ninth Congress of the United\r\nStates was not a Congress of the United States authorized by the\r\nConstitution of the United States to exercise legislative power in the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nA further charge, and on which greater reliance was placed, was set\r\nforth in these words:  \"That he had denied and intended to deny the\r\npower of the Thirty-ninth Congress to propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\"  These articles were in substance\r\nthe articles that had been rejected by the House of Representatives in\r\n1867.  Finally, as the most important averment of all, the President\r\nwas charged with an \"attempt to prevent the execution of the act\r\nentitled 'An Act Regulating the Tenure of Certain Civil Offices,'\r\npassed March 2, 1867, by unlawfully devising and contriving and\r\nattempting to contrive means by which he could prevent Edwin M. Stanton\r\nfrom forthwith resuming the function of the office of the Secretary for\r\nthe Department of War, notwithstanding the refusal of the Senate to\r\nconcur in the suspension theretofore made by said Andrew Johnson of the\r\nsaid Edwin M. Stanton from said office of Secretary for the Department\r\nof War.\"  In various forms of language these several charges were set\r\nforth in the different articles of impeachment--eleven in all.  The\r\neleventh article, which was prepared by Mr. Stevens, embodied the\r\nsummary of all the charges mentioned.  It is to be observed that in the\r\neleventh article there is no allegation that the President had\r\ncommitted an offence that was indictable under any statute of the\r\nUnited States or that would have been indictable at common law.  It\r\nmay be assumed, I think, that for this country, at least, the question\r\nthat was raised at the beginning and argued with great force, and by\r\nwhich possibly the House of Representatives may have been influenced\r\nin the year 1867, has been settled in accord with the report of the\r\nmajority of the Judiciary Committee.  The House decided that the\r\nPresident was impeachable for misdemeanors in office.  With stronger\r\nreason it may be said that every other civil officer is bound to\r\nbehave himself well in his office.  He cannot do any act which impairs\r\nhis standing in the place which he holds, or which may bring discredit\r\nupon the public, and especially he may not do any act in disregard of\r\nhis oath to obey the laws and to support the Constitution of the\r\ncountry.  The eleventh article was the chief article that was\r\nsubmitted to a vote in the Senate.  The question raised by that article\r\nis this in substance:  Is the President of the United States guilty in\r\nmanner and form as set forth in this article?  On that question thirty-\r\nfive Senators voted that he was guilty, and nineteen Senators voted\r\nthat he was not guilty.  Under the Constitution the President was found\r\nnot guilty of the offences charged, but the majority given may be\r\naccepted, and probably will be accepted, as the judgment of the Senate\r\nthat the President of the United States is liable to impeachment and\r\nremoval from office for acts and conduct that do not subject him to the\r\nprocess of indictment and trial in the criminal courts.  At this point\r\nI express the opinion that something has been gained, indeed that much\r\nhas been gained, by the decision of the House of Representatives,\r\nsupported by the opinions of a large majority in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the respondent, considered in connection with the\r\narguments that were made by his counsel, sets forth the ground upon\r\nwhich the Republican members of the Senate may have voted that the\r\nPresident was not guilty of the two principal offences charged, viz:\r\nthat in his speeches he had denounced and brought into contempt,\r\nintentionally, the Congress of the United States; and, second, that his\r\nattempted removal of Edwin M. Stanton was a violation of the Tenure\r\nof Office Act.  In the President's answer to article ten, which\r\ncontained the allegation that in his speech at St. Louis, in the year\r\n1866, he had used certain language in derogation of the authority of\r\nthe Congress of the United States, it was averred that the extracts did\r\nnot present his speech or address accurately.  Further than that, it\r\nwas claimed that the allegation under that article was not \"cognizable\r\nby the court as a high misdemeanor in office.\"  Finally, it was claimed\r\nthat proof should be made of the \"actual\" speech and address of the\r\nPresident on that occasion.  The managers were not able to meet the\r\ndemand for proof in a technical sense.  The speech was reported in the\r\nordinary way, and the proof was limited to the good faith of the\r\nreporters and the general accuracy of the printed report in the\r\nnewspapers.  In this situation as to the charges and the answer, it is\r\nnot difficult to reach the conclusion that members of the Senate had\r\nground for the vote of not guilty upon the several charges in regard\r\nto the speeches that were imputed to the President.\r\n\r\nJudge Curtis, in his opening argument, furnished a technical answer to\r\nthe article in which the President was charged with the violation of\r\nthe Tenure of Office Act, in his attempt to remove Mr. Stanton from the\r\noffice of Secretary of the Department of War.  Judge Curtis gave to the\r\nproviso to that statute an interpretation corresponding to the\r\ninterpretation given to criminal statutes.  Mr. Stanton was appointed\r\nto the office in the first term of Mr. Lincoln's administration.  The\r\nproviso of the statute was in these words:  \"Provided that the\r\nSecretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, etc., shall hold their\r\noffices for and during the term of the President by whom they may have\r\nbeen appointed, and for one month thereafter, subject to their removal\r\nby and with the advice of the Senate.\"  The proviso contained\r\nexceptions to the body of the statute, by which all civil officers who\r\nheld appointments by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\r\nwere secure in their places unless the Senate should assent to their\r\nremoval.  It was the object of the proviso to relieve an incoming\r\nPresident of Secretaries who had been appointed by his predecessor.\r\nThe construction of the proviso, as given by Judge Curtis, was fatal\r\nto the position taken by the managers.  It was claimed by the managers\r\nthat the sole object of the proviso was the relief of an incoming\r\nPresident from the continuance of a Secretary in office beyond thirty\r\ndays after the commencement of his term, and that it had no reference\r\nwhatever to the right of the President to remove a Secretary during\r\nhis term.\r\n\r\nThere were incidents in the course of the proceedings that possess\r\nhistorical value.  By the Constitution the Chief Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court is made the presiding officer in the Senate when the\r\nPresident is put upon trial on articles of impeachment.  Chief Justice\r\nChase claimed that he was to be addressed as \"Chief Justice.\"  That\r\nclaim was recognized by the counsel for the President and by some\r\nmembers of the Senate.  The managers claimed that he was there as the\r\npresiding officer, and not in his judiciary capacity.  He was addressed\r\nby the managers and some of the Senators as \"Mr. President.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a difference of opinion in the Senate, and a difference\r\nbetween the managers and the counsel for the respondent, as to the\r\nright of the presiding officer to rule upon questions of law and\r\nevidence arising in the course of the trial.  Under the rule of the\r\nSenate as adopted, the rulings of the President were to stand unless a\r\nSenator should ask for the judgment of the Senate.\r\n\r\nOther instances occurred which do not possess historical value, but\r\nwere incidents unusual in judicial proceedings.  When the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of the House was entering upon the investigation of the\r\nconduct of President Johnson, General Butler expressed the opinion that\r\nupon the adoption of articles of impeachment by the House the President\r\nwould be suspended in his office until the verdict of the Senate.  As\r\nthis view was not accepted by the committee, I made these remarks in\r\nmy opening speech to the House after a review of the arguments for and\r\nagainst the proposition:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot doubt the soundness of the opinion that the President, even\r\nwhen impeached by the House, is entitled to his office until he has\r\nbeen convicted by the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThis view was accepted.\r\n\r\nAt the first meeting of the managers I was elected chairman by the\r\nvotes of Mr. Stevens, General Logan, and General Butler.  Mr. Bingham\r\nreceived the votes of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Williams.  Upon the\r\nannouncement of the vote, Mr. Bingham made remarks indicating serious\r\ndisappointment and a purpose to retire from the Board of Managers.  I\r\naccepted the election, and acted as chairman at the meeting.  At the\r\nnext meeting, and without consultation with my associates, I resigned\r\nthe place and nominated Mr. Bingham.  The nomination was not objected\r\nto, and Mr. Bingham took the chair without comment by himself, nor was\r\nthere any comment by any other person.  The gentlemen who had given\r\nme their votes and support criticized my conduct with considerable\r\nfreedom, and were by no means reconciled by the statement which I made\r\nto them.  Having reference to the nature of the contest and the\r\ncondition of public sentiment, I thought it important that the\r\nmanagers should avoid any controversy before the public, especially as\r\nto a matter of premiership in the conduct of the trial.  It seemed to\r\nbe important that the entire force of the House of Representatives\r\nshould be directed to one object, the conviction of the accused.\r\nBeyond this, Mr. Bingham and Mr. Wilson had been opposed to the\r\nimpeachment of Mr. Johnson when the attempt was first made in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  I thought it important to combine the\r\nstrength that they represented in support of the proceeding in which\r\nwe were then engaged.  If Mr. Stevens had been in good health, he\r\nwould have received my support and the support of General Butler and\r\nGeneral Logan.  At that time his health was much impaired, but his\r\nintellectual faculties were free from any cloud.\r\n\r\nAnother incident occurred which does not require explanation, and which\r\nmay not be open to any explanation.  After the report of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, and its rejection by the House of Representatives, I was\r\nsurprised to receive an invitation from the President to dine with him\r\nat what is known as a State dinner.  I assumed that arrangements had\r\nbeen made for a series of such dinners, and that the invitation had\r\nbeen sent out by a clerk upon a prearranged plan as to the order of\r\ninvitations.  When the matter had passed out of my mind, but before\r\nthe day named for the dinner, I received a call on the floor of the\r\nHouse from Mr. Cooper, son-in-law of the President and secretary in\r\nthe Executive Mansion.  He asked me if I had received an invitation to\r\ndine with the President.  I said I had.  Next he said, \"Have you\r\nanswered it?\"  I said, \"No, I have not.\"  That was followed by the\r\nfurther question, \"Will you answer it?\"  I said, \"No, I shall not.\"\r\nThat ended the conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter the decision in the Senate had been made, the managers proceeded\r\nunder the order of the House to investigate the truthfulness of rumors\r\nthat were afloat, that money and other valuable considerations had been\r\nused to secure the acquittal of the President.  That investigation\r\nestablished the fact that money had been in the possession of persons\r\nwho had been engaged in efforts to secure the acquittal of the\r\nPresident.  Those persons, with perhaps a single exception, were\r\npersons who had no official connection with the Government, and none\r\nof them were connected with the Government at Washington.  As to most\r\nof them, it appeared that they had no reasons, indeed no good cause,\r\nwhy they should have taken part either for the conviction of the\r\nPresident or in behalf of his acquittal.  The sources from which funds\r\nwere obtained did not appear, nor was there evidence indicating the\r\namount that had been used, nor the objects to which the money had\r\nbeen applied.  It should be said as to Senators, that there was no\r\nevidence implicating them in the receipt of money or other valuable\r\nconsiderations.  One very important fact not then known to the managers\r\nappeared afterwards in the report of the Treasury Department, showing\r\na very large loss by the Government during the last eighteen months of\r\nMr. Johnson's administration.  In that period the total receipts from\r\nthe duties on spirits amounted to $41,678,684.34.  During the first\r\neighteen months of General Grant's administration, when the rates of\r\nduties and taxation remained the same, the total receipts of revenue\r\nfrom spirits amounted to $82,417,419.85, showing a difference of\r\n$40,738,735.51.  It is not easy to explain in full this money loss in\r\none branch of the public service.  Something may be attributed to the\r\nfact that persons obtained nominations for office by representations to\r\nthe President that they were his friends and supporters, and would\r\ncontinue to be so, under all circumstances.  When their nominations\r\ncame to the Senate, they made representations of an opposite character.\r\nWhen they had received their appointments, they very naturally allied\r\nthemselves with the President's policy, inasmuch as they could not be\r\neasily removed except upon an initiative taken by him.  This deficiency\r\noccurred in the states and districts in which the money should have\r\nbeen collected and through the agents employed there.  It other words,\r\nno part of the deficiency ever passed into the Treasury of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that a majority of the people now entertain the\r\nopinion that the action of the House of Representatives in the attempt\r\nthat was made to impeach President Johnson was an error.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to engage in a discussion on that point.  I end by\r\nthe expression of the opinion that the vote of the House and the vote\r\nof the Senate, by which the doctrine was established that a civil\r\nofficer is liable to impeachment for misdemeanor in office, is a gain\r\nto the public that is full compensation for the undertaking, and that\r\nthese proceedings against Mr. Johnson were free from any element or\r\nquality of injustice.\r\n\r\nJohnson's case ought to be borne in mind in all agitation for a longer\r\nPresidential term.  Whenever the country is engaged in a Presidential\r\ncontest there are complains by business men accompanied by a demand for\r\nan extension of the term of office to six or in some instances to ten\r\nyears.  The disturbance of business is due to the importance of the\r\nelection, and the importance of an election is due to the amount of\r\npower that is to be secured by the successful party.  An extension of\r\nthe term would add to the importance of the election, and a term of\r\nsix or ten years would intensify the contest and the injury to business\r\nwould be intensified, proportionately.  It is doubtful whether in a\r\nperiod of twenty or fifty years any appreciable relief to business\r\nwould be furnished by an extension of the term of the Presidential\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that the total of business is not as great\r\nas it would be in the same four years if the term were ten years\r\ninstead of four.  The total of production and consumption cannot be\r\naffected seriously by a political controversy that does not extend\r\nusually, over a period of more than three months.  If business is\r\ndiminished during those months there will be a corresponding gain in\r\nthe months that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIn a popular government there must be elections, and in all such\r\ngovernments business interests must be subordinated to the general\r\nwelfare.  The changes that have taken place since the Government was\r\norganized would justify the shortening rather than the lengthening\r\nof the Presidential term.  The means of communication are such that\r\ntwo years may give the mass of the people better means for judging\r\nmen and measures than could be had in four years at the opening of this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThere is no form of education that more fully justifies its cost than\r\nthe education that is gained in a Presidential canvass.  The\r\nnewspapers, the magazines, and more than all the speakers--\"stump\r\norators\" as they are called--communicate information and stimulate\r\nthought.  The voters are converted into a great jury, and after full\r\nallowance is made for weakness, corruption and coercion, they are\r\nadvanced at each quadrennial contest in their knowledge of men, in\r\ntheir ability to deal with measures of policy, and in comprehension\r\nof the principles of government.  If the losses in business were as\r\ngreat as is ever represented, the educational advantages of a\r\nPresidential canvass are an adequate set-off.  The people have an\r\nopportunity to see and hear the men who are engaged in public affairs\r\nand questions are discussed upon their intrinsic merits.  In the sixty\r\nyears of my experience there has been a great advance in the quality\r\nof the speeches to which the people have listened.  The speeches of\r\n1840 would not be tolerated in 1900.\r\n\r\nWhen great questions are under debate appeals are made to the\r\nprinciples of government and proportionately the education of the\r\npeople is of a higher grade.\r\n\r\nA serious objection to a long term in the Presidential office is the\r\nfact that a spirit of discontent, that always exists, will develop into\r\ninsubordination or even revolution.  We have an example in the history\r\nof the Republic of Hayti.  The term is seven years and in many cases\r\nthe President has been superseded by the leader of a revolutionary\r\nparty.  The most recent instance was the overthrow of President\r\nLegitime and the instalment of Hyppolite.  The peace and prosperity of\r\nHayti would be promoted by reducing the term of the Presidential office\r\nto two years.  The contests that are sure to arise among a mercurial\r\npeople would thus be transferred from the battle-field to the ballot-\r\nbox.  Who could have answered for the peace of the United States in\r\n1868 if President Johnson's term had been six years instead of eight\r\nmonths?\r\n\r\n[* This was a race riot, which occurred July 30, 1866, and in which\r\nmany negroes were killed.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\nTHE TREASURY DEPARTMENT IN 1869\r\n\r\nIn March, 1869, I was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by President\r\nGrant.  Soon after my appointment Mr. McCulloch, the retiring\r\nSecretary, said to me that I should find the department in excellent\r\norder, and that in his opinion the financial difficulties of the\r\nGovernment had been overcome.  The first of these statements was true\r\nin part, and in part it was very erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe accounting branch of the service was properly administered\r\npractically, but there were about one hundred persons on the pay rolls\r\nwho had no desks in the department, and who performed but little work\r\nat their homes, where some of them ostensibly were employed in\r\ncopying.\r\n\r\nSeveral heads of bureaus were notoriously intemperate.  This condition\r\nof things was due in part to the war and to the exigencies of the\r\ndepartment consequent upon the war; and in part it was due to the\r\nconstitutional infirmities of Mr. Chase and Mr. McCulloch.  In some\r\nrespects they resembled each other.  They were phlegmatic in\r\ntemperament, lacking in versatility, and lacking in facility for labor\r\nand business.\r\n\r\nMr. McCulloch was diligent, industrious and conscientiously devoted to\r\nhis duties.  He had been crippled in his administration by the conflict\r\nbetween Congress and the President.  The head of the Treasury needs\r\nthe confidence of the President, and the confidence and the support of\r\nCongress.  The latter Mr. McCulloch did not enjoy, and there were\r\nindications that in some respects he differed with the President.  He\r\nwas hampered by the fact that any change in the personnel of his\r\ndepartment would be followed by inquiries from one party or the other,\r\ncoupled oftentimes with complaints and criticisms.\r\n\r\nGreat evils existed in the revenue system.  The controversy between\r\nCongress and the President led to many removals of collectors of\r\ncustoms and of internal revenue.  Their places were supplied by persons\r\nwho could accommodate themselves to both parties.  The President was\r\nmade to believe that the applicants were his friends, but that their\r\nrelations with Republican Senators were such that they could secure\r\nconfirmation.  When nominated these men represented themselves as good\r\nRepublicans and friendly to the Congressional policy.  From such\r\npersons an honest performance of duty could not have been expected.\r\nHence gross frauds upon the revenue were perpetrated and in most\r\ninstances by the connivance of those in office.\r\n\r\nThe returns for the last year of Johnson's administration, and the\r\nfirst years of Grant's administration, showed that the loss on whisky\r\nin the first named period was not less than thirty million dollars.\r\n\r\nThat there were other great losses was proved by the facts that the\r\npayments on the public debt were less than thirty million dollars\r\nduring the last year of Johnson's administration and that the payments\r\nwere one hundred million dollars during the first year of Grant's\r\nadministration, and that without any additional sources of revenue.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. McCulloch's first statement had been true in the most important\r\nparticulars, his second claim would not have been open to debate.  It\r\nwas true that the department had passed the point where there was any\r\nexigency for money.  The Government was no longer a borrower.  Payments\r\non the public debt had been made, but otherwise nothing had been done\r\nto relieve the country of the interest account, nor was the credit of\r\nthe Government such that any practicable movement in that direction\r\ncould have been made.\r\n\r\nThe six per cent bonds were worth only 83 or 84, and no step had been\r\ntaken to redeem the pledge of the Government in regard to the Sinking\r\nFund made in the act of February 25, 1862.  The interest account\r\nexceeded two hundred and thirty-three million dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. S. M. Clark was the chief of the Bureau of Printing and Engraving\r\nand everything was confided to him.  It is to be said after the lapse\r\nof thirty years for examination, that not a tittle of evidence has\r\nbeen found warranting any imputation upon his integrity.  It is true\r\nthat in one instance a dishonest plate printer took an impression of\r\na bond upon a sheet of lead for use in counterfeiting.  The possibility\r\nof such an act was due to a lack of system and not to any want of\r\nfidelity in Mr. Clark.  One of my first acts was to remove Mr. Clark,\r\nand then to open a new set of books.  The printing of the old issues\r\nwas suspended permanently, and new plates were prepared.  Mr. Clark had\r\nhad control of the manufacture of the paper, the control of the\r\nengravers, the control of the plates, the control of the printers, of\r\nthe counters, and he had had the custody of the red seal.  The postal\r\ncurrency was printed under his direction.  The pieces were not\r\nnumbered, they were due bills only.  At the end of twenty years the\r\nbooks showed an issue of about fifteen million dollars in excess of the\r\nredemptions.\r\n\r\nHis power was unlimited as there were no checks upon him.  He once said\r\nto me when a committee of Congress was investigating his bureau, during\r\nMr. McCulloch's administration:\r\n\r\n\"They will never find a five cent piece out of the way.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the discharge of Clark, I ordered an account of stock to be\r\ntaken.  I appointed a custodian of the plates after a full inventory\r\nhad been made, whose duty it was to deliver the plates each morning\r\nto the printers, to charge them to the printers, to receive them at the\r\nclose of the day, and to settle the account of each man.  A special\r\npaper was designated and public notice was given under the statute by\r\nwhich it was made a crime for any person to make, use or have in his\r\npossession any paper so designated.  The paper was manufactured under\r\nthe supervision of an agent of the department, who was authorized to\r\ncount and receive all the paper at the mills and to answer the orders\r\nfor its delivery to the printers.  The paper making machine was\r\nequipped with a register which numbered the sheets of paper.  That\r\nrecord was compared daily with the number of sheets received by the\r\nagent, and thus the Government was protected against any fraudulent or\r\nerroneous issue of paper.  Registers were also placed upon each\r\nprinting press.  Each morning one thousand sheets of paper were\r\ndelivered to each plate printer, and at the close of work his printed\r\nsheets were counted and the number compared with the register before\r\nthe printer was allowed to leave the office.  In like manner there was\r\nan accounting with each counter.  The same system was extended to the\r\nmanagers of the machines used for numbering bonds and bank notes.  The\r\nregistering machine was made by an employee, under my direction, and\r\nat the cost of the Government.\r\n\r\nBooks of account were opened upon the new system.  During my\r\nadministration, as far as I know, there was never the loss of a sheet\r\nof paper nor was there a fraud committed in connection with the\r\nbusiness of the bureau.  For further security, I made arrangements by\r\nwhich two bank note companies in the City of New York prepared sets\r\nof plates for a single printing on each security, the red seal being\r\nimprinted in the Treasury Bureau.  By this arrangement collusion was\r\nimpossible.  The expense of printing was increased by this arrangement,\r\nbut it seemed to be more important to attain absolute security against\r\nfraud than to save money.  My successors have thought otherwise and the\r\nprinting is now done in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nDuring my term I ascertained that a man in New York who had once been\r\nemployed to print certain securities, had in his possession the plates\r\nwhich he had used and which he claimed as his property.  The printing\r\nhad been done in Mr. Chase's administration and there was no agreement\r\nthat the plates were to be delivered to the Government.  The plates\r\nwere obtained, finally, by the payment of a sum of money.  The person\r\nwho had the plates was an old man, and there was danger that they might\r\nfall into the hands of dishonest parties.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in charge of the Treasury I had an understanding with\r\nColonel Whiteley, the Chief of the Secret Service that I should have an\r\ninterview with any expert professional criminals who might fall into\r\nhis hands.  I recall an interview with one such criminal.  A man of\r\nforty years and a gentleman in appearance, and a professional\r\ngentleman, as well as a criminal by profession.\r\n\r\nUpon the suggestion of Colonel Whiteley I gave the prisoner a fresh\r\none dollar green-back note.  He took a phial of liquid from his\r\npocket, wet one half of the paper with the liquid and in my presence\r\nthe colors disappeared from the paper.  Time and exposure have given\r\na dark tinge to the paper which was a pure white when the experiment\r\nwas ended.  By the use of the liquid the counterfeiter was able to\r\nobtain a piece of fibre paper on which a bill of large denomination\r\nmight be printed, given only the engraving.\r\n\r\nThe revenue marine service was impaired by the incompetency of many of\r\nthe officers, and its efficiency was also impaired by the size and\r\nquality of the ships.  Some of them were sailing vessels, most of them\r\nwere of wood, and the modern ones were unnecessarily large in size.  I\r\ncreated a commission and all the officers except a few who were too old\r\nfor active service were subjected to an examination and those who were\r\nfound incompetent were discharged from the service.  Their places were\r\nfilled by young, active and well qualified men.\r\n\r\nA commission was appointed to consider and report upon the size of the\r\nvessels that were best adapted to the service.  Three reports from\r\nsuccessive commissions were made before a satisfactory result was\r\nreached.  Finally, a report was made by Captain Carlisle Patterson,\r\nthat was approved by me and by a committee of Congress.  The\r\nrecommendations of that report have been followed, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Mint Service was without organization.  Each mint and\r\nassay office was in charge of an officer called superintendent, but\r\nthere was no head unless the Secretary of the Treasury could be so\r\nconsidered, as all the business came to him.  Upon my recommendation\r\nCongress authorized the appointment of a Director of the Mint, and\r\nupon my recommendation the President appointed Dr. Linderman, a\r\nPhiladelphia Democrat, but a gentleman familiar with the service.\r\nUnder him the service was organized and made systematic.\r\n\r\nWhen I took charge of the Treasury Department there was no system of\r\nbookkeeping and accounting, that was uniform in the various customs\r\nhouses of the country.  Each port had a plan or mode of its own, and\r\nthere was no one that was so perfect that it could be accepted as a\r\nmodel in all the ports.  The books and forms were made and prepared at\r\nthe several ports and often at inordinate rates of cost.\r\n\r\nI appointed a commission of Treasury experts to prepare forms and books\r\nfor every branch of business.  Their report was accepted and since that\r\ntime the modes of accounting have been the same at all the ports.  The\r\nstationery prepared is furnished through the Government printing\r\noffice, at a considerable saving in cost, and clerks in the accounting\r\nbranch of the Treasury are relieved of much labor in the preparation\r\nof statements.\r\n\r\nUpon the transfer of Mr. Columbus Delano from the office of\r\ncommissioner of Internal Revenue to the Secretaryship of the Interior\r\nDepartment, the question of the appointment of a successor was\r\nconsidered.  The President named General Alfred Pleasanton, who was\r\nthen a collector of internal revenue in the city of New York.  He had\r\nbeen a good cavalry officer, a graduate of West Point, and the\r\nPresident was attached to him.  My acquaintance with Pleasanton was\r\nlimited, but I was quite doubtful of his fitness for the place.  My\r\nopposition gave rise to some delay, but at the end the appointment\r\nwas made, the President saying in reply to my doubts that if he did\r\nnot succeed he had only to say so to the General and he would leave\r\nat once.  The appointment of Pleasanton was urged by Mr. Delano and\r\nGeneral Horace Porter as I understood, both of whom were very near\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nPleasanton had been informed of my position, and although I was his\r\nimmediate superior he did not call upon me, nor did he ever, except\r\nupon one occasion, come into my office, unless I sent for him.  On\r\nmy part I resolved to avoid any criticism upon his official conduct\r\nunless compelled to do so.  He entered upon his duties the first of\r\nJanuary, 1871, and although in several instances I had occasion to\r\ncontrol his purposes in regard to contracts and to the refund of\r\ntaxes, I did not feel called upon to mention the facts to the\r\nPresident.  In May the President said:\r\n\r\n\"I have come to the conclusion that Pleasanton is not succeeding in\r\nhis office.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:  \"That is so.\"\r\n\r\nThe President then said:  \"I will try to find some other place for him,\r\nand I will then ask him to resign.\"\r\n\r\nThe President went to Long Branch for the summer and nothing was done.\r\nI had very early discovered that Samuel Ward was exercising a good\r\ndeal of influence over the commissioner.  It was his policy to secure\r\ninfluence by giving dinners and entertainments, and, as far as\r\npossible, he obtained the attendance of influential members of Congress\r\nand of the chief officers in the executive departments.  He once said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not introduce my measures at these entertainments, but I put\r\nmyself upon terms with persons who have power.\"\r\n\r\nOn a time I received a report on the subject of refunding a cotton\r\ntax amounting to about $600,000.  It bore two endorsements--one by the\r\nsolicitor \"Examined and disallowed, Chesley,\" and one by the\r\ncommissioner \"Allowed, Pleasanton.\"\r\n\r\nI placed the report in my private drawer with the purpose of delaying\r\naction until I should ascertain where the propelling force existed.\r\nHaving occasion to go to Massachusetts I was absent about two weeks.\r\nUpon my return Mr. Ward came into my office and inquired whether I had\r\nreceived the report.  I replied that I had received it.  \"Had I acted\r\nupon it?\"  I said that I had not.  He then proceeded to say that the\r\nclaim was a good one,--that Mr. Delano had examined it, and had\r\nconcluded to pass it, but as he left the office rather suddenly he had\r\nneglected to act upon it.  Finally, he expressed the hope that I would\r\nact without delay.  I had already decided the case adversely upon the\r\nground that the allowance was unauthorized.  Therefore I had only to\r\nendorse the word \"disallowed\" with my signature and to return the\r\nreport to the commissioner.  I learned that the commissioner was\r\nengaged through the agency of Ward in making a contract with a\r\nConnecticut firm that was in my opinion at once improvident and\r\nirregular.  This act led me to determine to end the difficulty at once.\r\nI went to the Executive Mansion and asked General Babcock to go to\r\nLong Branch and say to the President that the business of the Internal\r\nRevenue Office was in such a condition that immediate action was\r\nnecessary.  As a result the President returned that night and early\r\nthe next morning he sent for me.  I stated the facts, and he said he\r\nwould send for General Pleasanton and ask him to resign.  At the\r\ninterview Pleasanton asked for the reasons.  The President said:  \"The\r\nSecretary is not satisfied with your administration.\"  Pleasanton\r\nreplied:  \"I think I can make everything satisfactory to the\r\nSecretary.\"  The President replied, naturally:  \"If you can, I am\r\ncontent.\"  Then for the first time Pleasanton came to my office\r\nwithout a request from me.  I invited him into my private room, and\r\nwhen he had related his interview with the President, I said:\r\n\"General, if this were a personal matter we might come to an\r\nunderstanding, but your administration of the office has been a\r\nfailure from the first and you must resign.\"  This ended the interview.\r\nHe refused to resign and the President removed him.  He appealed to\r\nthe Senate in a lengthy communication, but without effect.  Pleasanton\r\nmay have been, and probably was, a good military officer, but he did\r\nnot possess the qualities that are essential in the discharge of\r\nimportant civil trusts.\r\n\r\nNeither from my experience in Congress nor in the Treasury Department\r\ncan I deduce much support for the doctrines of the class of politicians\r\ncalled Civil Service Reformers.  From their statements it would appear\r\nthat every member of Congress was the recipient of an amount of\r\npatronage in the nature of clerkships that he could and did control.\r\nI can say for myself that as a member I never asserted any such right\r\nand as the head of the Treasury I can say that no such claim was ever\r\nmade upon me by any member of Congress.  The nearest approach to it was\r\nby George W. Julian.  During one of his canvasses for re-nomination,\r\na clerk named Smith, and a correspondent of a journal in Mr. Julian's\r\ndistrict, had advocated the nomination of Mr. Wilson (Jeremiah).  When\r\nMr. Julian secured the nomination, Smith gave him his support.\r\nNevertheless when Julian returned to Washington he demanded Smith's\r\nremoval.  After hearing all the facts I declined to act.  Julian was\r\nvery indignant, and afterwards from the Astor House, New York, wrote me\r\na violent, I think I might say unreasonable letter.\r\n\r\nThe public mind has been much misled by the statements in regard to\r\nremovals and appointments.  The employees in a department are of two\r\nsorts.  There is a class who are trained men in the places that they\r\noccupy.  They have been in the service for a long period.  They are\r\nfamiliar with the laws relating to their duties, and to the decisions\r\nof the courts thereon, and they are the possessors of the traditions\r\nof the offices.  They are as nearly indispensable as one man can be\r\nto another, or to the safe management of business.  The head of a\r\ndepartment cannot dispense with the services of such men.  All thought\r\nof political opinions disappears.  The responsibility of a change in\r\nsuch a case is very great.  No prudent administrator of a public trust\r\nwill venture upon such experiments.  There is another class of clerks\r\nwho are employed in copying, in making computations in simple\r\narithmetic, in writing letters under dictation, and in other ordinary\r\nclerical work.\r\n\r\nThe public interest is not very large in the retention of such persons.\r\nThe ordinary graduates of the high schools of the country are competent\r\nfor all those duties.  But the clerks of this class are not removed in\r\nmass, and they never will be, under any administration.  Even a fresh\r\nman at the head of a department will soon find that the fancied\r\npolitical advantages are no adequate compensation for the trouble that\r\nhe assumes and the risk of error and fraud that he runs when he takes\r\nnew and untried persons in the place of those who have been tested.\r\nAs late as 1870 about thirty per cent. of the employees of the\r\nTreasury in 1860 were in office, and this notwithstanding that the\r\nTreasury furnished recruits for both armies.  During my time and for\r\nyears afterward, the post of Assistant Secretary was held by Mr.\r\nHartley, a Democrat from the days of Pierce and Buchanan.  He was\r\nexperienced, diligent and entirely trustworthy.\r\n\r\nOf the first class of employees it is to be said that there is no\r\noccasion to embalm them in their offices, and if their pay is adequate\r\nthere is no ground for placing them upon the pension rolls.  Their\r\nduties are not as exacting as the duties and labors of men in\r\ncorresponding stations in private life.  As to the second class, their\r\nrelations to the public are such that no public obligation arises\r\nexcept to pay them the stipulated salaries.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to a proper administration that the Secretary or the\r\nPresident should have the power of removal, and it should never be\r\ncoupled with the duty of making a statement of the cause.  Not\r\ninfrequently a statement would be the occasion of scandal and of\r\nsuffering by innocent parties.  The power may be abused as every\r\npower may be, in the hands of dishonest or corrupt men.  This is one\r\nof the perils to the public, a peril from which no government can\r\nescape.  With us a change of rulers is a remedy for political wrongs\r\nthat do not belong to the catalogue of crimes.  It may be said,\r\nhowever, that this power of removal gives to a dishonest administrator\r\nof a department the opportunity to secure the appointment of his\r\npolitical friends in the place of political opponents removed, and this\r\nwhatever may be the method of appointment.  The candidates may pass\r\nthe competitive examination, and they may enter upon their duties, but\r\ntheir chief in thirty or sixty days may find them lacking in practical\r\naptitude, and so on, until those of the true faith shall be sent\r\nforward by the examining board.\r\n\r\nHonest administrators of official duties are embarrassed by the system\r\nand dishonest ones evade it.  The system may become the enemy of\r\nhonesty and the shield of hypocrisy.  Only this is needed.  When the\r\nappointing power has designated a person for an office, let that person\r\nbe examined by an independent board with reference to character and\r\nthose qualifications which seem to be a fit preparation for the\r\npractical duties of the place.  Whenever the power of appointment and\r\nremoval is abused the public has a remedy in a change of\r\nadministration.  And herein is one reason why the Presidential term\r\nshould not be extended.  There may be many evils of administration\r\nwhich are not so flagrant as to warrant proceedings for impeachment.\r\nSuch evils may be borne for brief periods, when if the term of the\r\nPresident were extended to six or eight years the dissatisfied elements\r\nof society might be tempted to engage in revolutionary movements.  Nor\r\nis there wisdom in limiting the Presidential office to a single term in\r\nthe same person.  The thought that one has a future is a great stimulus\r\nto careful and energetic action in the performance of public duties.\r\nFor a President there is no future except a re-election, which is in\r\nfact an approval by the country of his administration.  A wise man will\r\nstrive to so conduct affairs as to merit that approval.  A House of\r\nRepresentatives already condemned by a popular verdict is but a poor\r\nguardian of the rights of the people; and a defeated administration\r\nperforms its duties in the most indifferent manner.  After a defeat\r\nappointments will be made and acts done that would not have been\r\nhazarded pending an election.  It is true, probably, of every\r\nadministration, not excepting that of General Washington, that the\r\nsecond term was less acceptable to the country than the first.  Mr.\r\nLincoln had no second term, and it is useless to speculate upon its\r\nprobable character, if he had lived to perform its duties.\r\n\r\nIt was my habit to be at the Treasury every morning at nine o'clock,\r\nand I usually sent immediately for one or more heads of division or\r\nchiefs of bureau for conference upon some matter connected with their\r\nduties.  By frequent interviews I acquired such knowledge of their\r\nduties and of pending questions that I always had a reason for those\r\ninterviews.  By this course I maintained relations of familiarity with\r\nthe officers who constituted the department for administrative\r\npurposes, and I also established a system of punctuality in the matter\r\nof attendance.  When the head of a division is tardy, the clerks soon\r\nventure to follow his example, and if he is prompt they are ashamed\r\nto be dilatory unless they have an adequate excuse.  The same relation\r\nexists between the bureau officers and the head of a department.\r\n\r\nOne of my first acts in the nature of a financial policy was to\r\nestablish the Sinking Fund, agreeably to the act of February 25, 1862.\r\nSeven years had passed since the passage of the law and four years\r\nsince the end of the war and yet nothing had been done to provide for\r\nthe redemption of the public debt agreeably to the promise that had\r\nbeen made when the Government was a large borrower of money and when\r\nits credit was depreciated, seriously, in all the markets of the\r\nworld.  In my first annual report, December, 1869, I advised Congress\r\nof my action and I recommended the application of the bonds that I had\r\nthen purchased, amounting to about fifty-four million dollars, to the\r\nSinking Fund, until the deficiency then existing had been met.  The\r\nstep that I then took was taken in obedience to the law, and not\r\nfrom any great faith in the wisdom of the Sinking Fund policy, nor was\r\nit from any fear that the Government could not pay its debts whether\r\na Sinking Fund was or was not created.\r\n\r\nThe faith of the Government had been pledged to a particular policy and\r\nI thought that the observance of that policy was both wise and just.  A\r\ngovernment cannot afford to disregard the terms of its undertakings\r\neven if a violation or neglect does not work harm to anyone.  The\r\npayments to the Sinking Fund were made regularly during General Grant's\r\nadministration, and the credit of the Government was thereby somewhat\r\nstrengthened.  The chief element of strength was in the fact that the\r\npayments were such as to astonish the heavily taxed and debt burdened\r\nStates of Europe.  In my four years of service as the head of the\r\nTreasury the payments on the debt reached the enormous sum of three\r\nhundred and sixty-four million dollars.  No one of my successors has\r\npaid an equal amount, nor has an equal amount been paid in any other\r\nequal period of time by the United States or by any other government.\r\n\r\nAt the time I entered the Treasury the price of gold was at about\r\nforty per cent premium and when I left the Treasury it was at about\r\ntwelve per cent premium.  In the summer of 1869 I entered upon the\r\npolicy of selling gold and buying bonds.  The sales and purchases\r\nwere made by the Assistant Treasurer in New York, but the bids were\r\nreported to me and by me accepted or rejected.  A leading criticism was\r\nthis:  It was claimed that the simple method was to buy bonds in gold\r\nand thus to secure the bonds by one transaction.\r\n\r\nThis policy would have limited the number of purchasers of gold to\r\nthose who could command bonds.  By the policy pursued the sales of gold\r\nwere open to anyone who had money.  The gold was sold for currency, and\r\nthe bonds were purchased with currency.  When the Treasury announced\r\nits purpose to purchase bonds the price advanced in the market.  The\r\nPresident remarked to me jocularly that he had suffered by not knowing\r\nwhat the department was about to do, inasmuch as he had sold bonds a\r\nfew days too early and at a price below their then present value.\r\nDuring my service as Secretary of the Treasury I carried two\r\nquestions only to the Cabinet discussions--and I have forgotten one\r\nof the questions, but it had some political significance.  The other\r\narose in this manner:  My method of negotiating the sale of new bonds\r\nunder the Funding Act of July, 1870, had been severely criticized.\r\nThe Government was compelled to give ninety days' notice of its\r\npurpose to redeem five-twenty bonds, and as we could not with safety\r\nmake a call until we had the funds, and as our chief source was the\r\nproceeds of new bonds we could not call until a sale was made.  As a\r\nconsequence the Government was a loser of interest on all called bonds\r\nfor the period of ninety days.  I arranged with the subscribers for\r\nnew bonds, that they should have the interest for the ninety days\r\nupon a deposit of old bonds as security for the new ones subscribed\r\nand taken.  The Government lost nothing, and the subscribers were\r\nbenefitted greatly, and thus the subscriptions were increased.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1872 I had an opportunity to negotiate a new\r\nloan upon the same basis.  Knowing that the proceeding would renew\r\ncriticism, I thought it proper to lay the case before the President\r\nand Cabinet.  Upon their advice the negotiations were suspended.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fish on more than one occasion complained that the Cabinet\r\nwere as ignorant of the proceedings and purposes of the Treasury as\r\nwas the outside world.  His complaints were well founded.  Much of the\r\nbusiness aside from routine matters was secret.  For example my orders\r\nfor the sale of gold and the purchase of bonds were never issued at\r\nany other time than Sunday evening, and then always by myself.  The\r\norders were sent to the Sub-Treasurer at New York, and given to the\r\nAssociated Press at the same time.  Consequently, on Monday morning\r\nall the country was informed, and under such circumstances that the\r\nchance of some to speculate upon the ignorance of others were reduced\r\nto the minimum.  Moreover, the members of the Cabinet might divide.  I\r\nshould then be compelled to act upon my own judgment, and against the\r\nviews of some of my associates.  Again, if I had the support of the\r\nPresident and Cabinet, I could not have used the fact as an excuse for\r\nmyself.  The public knew no one but the Secretary.  I chose to act upon\r\nmy own judgment knowing that there was no one else to share the\r\nresponsibility in case of failure.\r\n\r\nIn my report to Congress, in December, 1869, I set forth a system for\r\nrefunding the Public Debt.  I had unfolded the scheme in a speech in\r\nthe House of Representatives, July 1868.  I had already taken two\r\nsteps preparatory to the undertaking.  First, in May, 1869, I\r\nestablished the Sinking Fund under the Act of February 25, 1862.\r\nSecond, by the purchase of bonds the world had assurance that the debt\r\nwould be paid.  The effect of these two measures was seen in the\r\nincreasing market value of the bonds.  In other words the credit of the\r\ncountry was improving.  When the President was preparing his message of\r\nDecember, 1869, he called upon me for my views in regard to the\r\nTreasury, and I furnished him with a synopsis of my plan which he\r\nembodied in his message.  I retained a copy of the synopsis and that\r\ncopy is in the hands of my daughter.  Simultaneously I prepared a bill\r\nupon the basis of the report and caused the same to be printed upon the\r\nTreasury press.  Upon an examination of the papers on file in the\r\narchives of the Senate I find that cuttings from my printed bill form\r\na part of the bill which was printed by the Finance Committee of the\r\nSenate of which Senator Sherman was chairman.  The bill was changed in\r\ndetails but not in principle.  The loan was in three parts as my bill\r\nwas prepared.  A portion at 5 per cent, a portion at 4˝ per cent,\r\nand a third portion at 4 per cent.  The division was retained in the\r\nstatute, but the amount of the loan at each of the several rates was\r\nchanged.  By my bill the interest could be made payable in Europe.\r\nThis feature was stricken out by the committees in the House or the\r\nSenate.  This change I overcame or avoided ultimately by a rule of the\r\ndepartment by which interest on registered bonds could be made payable\r\nin checks of the Treasurer.  These checks are now sent to all parts of\r\nthe world and through the banking facilities they are everywhere as\r\ngood as gold, subject only to the natural rates of exchange between\r\ndifferent countries.  Since that time railroad companies and other\r\nbusiness corporations have accepted the system.  My plan of making the\r\ninterest on the bonds payable in Europe was rejected under the lead of\r\ngentlemen who thought it involved some sort of national degradation.\r\nMy object was to make the loan more negotiable in Europe and thus to\r\nextend the demand, and consequently, to increase the value of our\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Treasury Department show that on the 23rd day of\r\nDecember, 1869, I sent to General Schenck of the House, a draught of a\r\nbill for refunding the Public Debt.  The same records show that on the\r\n19th of January, 1870, I sent to Senator Sherman eight copies of a\r\nbill.  These bills were framed in conformity to the plan marked out in\r\nmy report of December, 1869.  Previous to the preparation of that\r\nreport I had not any conference with any member of Congress nor with\r\nany other person in regard to the details of the scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, 1870, Mr. Sumner introduced a bill for refunding\r\nthe Pubic Debt (Sen. S. 80).  As might have been expected it was not\r\na practical measure, and on the 3rd day of the following February Mr.\r\nSherman reported the bill of Mr. Sumner in a new draught.  A single\r\ncopy of that bill is on file in the office of the secretary of the\r\nSenate, and no other copy can be found.\r\n\r\nThis bill conforms to my report, and upon my recollection it is the\r\nbill as prepared by me.  The division of the loan conforms to my\r\nrecommendation in the report, and it provides that the interest may be\r\nmade payable abroad.  Subsequently these provisions were changed.\r\nGeneral Schenck had then recently returned from Europe and he was of\r\nthe opinion that the loan could all be negotiated at four or four and\r\none half per cent and it was this opinion on his part which led to\r\ndelays.  The bill was not passed till July, 1870, at the very moment\r\nwhen the Franco-Prussian War opened.  Had the bill been passed in\r\nMarch, quite large negotiations could have been made in April of that\r\nyear.  But the sale of the new five per cent bonds was an undertaking\r\nof great difficulty.  It is now impossible to realize that a six per\r\ncent bond was not worth par in 1869-'70.  At that time the leading\r\nbankers of the world were unwilling to engage in the undertaking.  The\r\nRothschilds and Barings stood aloof.  The Amsterdam bankers wrote\r\nletters of inquiry, but they did nothing more.  Mr. Morton, of the firm\r\nof Morton, Bliss & Co., New York, was inclined to engage in the\r\nbusiness, but his partner, Mr. Bliss was doubtful of the success of\r\nthe scheme, and they therefore stood aside when the first negotiations\r\nwere attempted.  Finally an arrangement was made with Jay Cooke & Co.,\r\nby which they advertised what was called a popular loan, asking for a\r\nsubscription to the five per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nSubsequently I advised Congress to issue four per cent fifty year bonds\r\nas a basis of the banking system, coupled with an offer to the existing\r\nbanks of a preference, but in case any bank should refuse to exchange\r\nthe bonds then held by such bank, its charter after one year should be\r\nannulled and its banking privileges should be open to any other\r\nassociation that would purchase the four per cent bonds.  This\r\nproposition aroused the hostility of the national banks and forthwith\r\nthe city was invaded by bank officers and agents who succeeded in\r\ndefeating the bill.\r\n\r\nI had early foreseen that the Public Debt could be paid without much\r\ndelay, and without a system of oppressive taxation.  In July, 1863, in\r\nthe introduction to my volume on the tax system of the country, I had\r\npredicted that the revenues would be equal to the payment of interest\r\non a debt twice as large as the Public Debt then was, together with\r\nlarge annual payments of principal.  I predicted also that these\r\npayments would menace the national banking system.  My scheme looked\r\nfor the perpetuation of that system for fifty years at least.  The\r\nbanks looked upon the scheme as a hostile project and they were\r\ntherefore led to defeat a measure which in fact was liberal in the\r\nextreme.  At that time the capital of all the national banks was\r\nlimited to three hundred million dollars.  Thus did the banks defeat a\r\nmeasure which was designed to secure their perpetuity and calculated\r\nto promote their financial interests.  They acted upon the idea that\r\nthe credit of the country could never be so far advanced that a four\r\nper cent bond would be worth par.\r\n\r\nThe success of the five per cent loan of 1871, of which I give a full\r\naccount elsewhere, should have ended the contest in regard to the\r\ncredit of the United States.  A five per cent bond had been sold at par\r\nin the London market.  The principal of the Public Debt was undergoing\r\na monthly reduction and the gain in the interest account was sufficient\r\nto guarantee the payment of the principal in half a century.  From that\r\ntime forward, the leading bankers of Europe and American were ready to\r\nco-operate in placing the remaining five per cents, and then the four\r\nand a half and four per cents.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward the credit of the Government has been improving\r\nconstantly.  It was no longer difficult to borrow money at the rate of\r\nfive per cent, and with the adjustment of our controversy with Great\r\nBritain there remained no reason to question the rapid progress of the\r\nUnited States in wealth and population.  Indeed, it was then entirely\r\nfeasible for the Government to have resumed specie payments, as any\r\ndemand upon the Treasury for gold could have been met with proceeds of\r\nbonds sold in Europe.  It was my opinion, however, that it would be\r\nwiser to delay resumption until the balance of trade should be so much\r\nin our favor that specie payments could be maintained by our own\r\nresources.  And this was accomplished in less than six years.  It is\r\nwith a state as it is with an individual.  With an established credit,\r\nor with a credit improving constantly and an income in excess of\r\nexpenditures, there is no difficulty in meeting all liabilities as\r\nthey mature.  Such was the condition of the Treasury when I left it in\r\nMarch, 1873.  In March, 1869, the Government was paying interest,\r\nmeasured at the gold value of its securities at the rate of seven per\r\ncent.  In 1873 the rate was five per cent or less.  In that time the\r\nnet Public Debt had been reduced in the sum of three hundred and sixty-\r\nfour million dollars, and the interest account had been reduced about\r\nthirty million dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen I was engaged in placing bonds in Europe, a discussion arose among\r\nbankers in regard to the conflict of statements as to the amount of the\r\nPublic Debt.  By the reports of the Treasurer, which were the basis of\r\nthe monthly statements, the debt was represented by the securities\r\nactually issued after deducting those which had been redeemed.  By the\r\nreport from the Registrar's Office which once each year corresponded\r\nin time to the monthly report, the balance was widely different.  These\r\nfacts impaired our standing financially.  Upon the register's books the\r\nGovernment was charged with every issue that passed out of his office,\r\nand it was days, usually, and not infrequently it was weeks, before the\r\nsecurities passed from the Treasury into the hands of creditors or\r\npurchasers of securities.  On the other hand the Treasurer would be\r\nentitled to credit for redemptions made days or weeks before the\r\nevidence of such payments would appear on the register's books.  An\r\nanalogous fact exists in the discrepancy between a depositor's account\r\nwith his bank and the account at the bank as long as there are\r\noutstanding checks.  The books would not agree and yet each might be\r\naccurate.  As it was a necessity of the situation that the business\r\nof the Treasury should proceed day by day without interruption and it\r\nwas difficult to explain the discrepancy to the many inquirers, I\r\nordered Mr. Allison, the register, to accept for his annual reports the\r\nstatement of the Treasurer, as his statements conformed to the existing\r\nfacts on the days when the statements were made.  The register\r\nprotested that the order was not justified by the law, and that was\r\nthe truth although there was no law forbidding such an act.  The\r\ntransaction, including my order, was brought before a committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, but as far as I know, the question of the\r\nlegality of the proceedings, was not canvassed, or if attention was\r\ndirected to the subject the committee may have treated it as an act in\r\nthe public interest and from which no injury had arisen.  Upon these\r\nfacts, Senator Henry G. Davis, of West Virginia, made the charge that\r\nthe books of the Treasury had been altered by my direction and that it\r\nwas possible that some great fraud had been perpetrated which might be\r\ndiscovered if a committee were appointed to investigate the Treasury.\r\nA committee was granted, of which Senator Davis was a member.  The\r\ninvestigation was a failure from his standpoint.  Indeed, the\r\nalteration of the books of the Treasury would required the collusive\r\nco-operation of many persons, and evidence of the fact of the\r\nalteration would, of necessity, become known to hundreds of clerks.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis and some other Democrats implicated me in an analogous matter\r\nwhich they tried to understand but did not.  The Loan Accounts of the\r\nTreasury Department showed that the payments on the Public Debt\r\nexceeded the receipts from loans in the enormous sum of one hundred and\r\nsixteen million dollars.  I appointed a committee of clerks to examine\r\nthe account in detail for the purpose of ascertaining whether the\r\ndiscrepancy was real or only apparent.  The fact of the discrepancy was\r\nreported to Congress and the progress made in the investigation was\r\nnoted in the appendix to the Annual Reports.  It is probable, however,\r\nthat these reports were never seen by Mr. Davis, and hence his\r\nsuspicion that an investigation into the accuracy of the Treasury\r\naccounts would show an alteration of Treasury books, and of course, for\r\nsome improper purpose.\r\n\r\nThe error began in Mr. Hamilton's time, and in consequence of the\r\nassumption of the State debts.  Bonds were issued for those debts but\r\nthere were no receipts paid into the Treasury, and consequently the\r\ndebit side of the account was a blank.  When the bonds were paid the\r\npayment became a credit on the loan account.  In after times bonds were\r\nissued and sold below par.  The account was charged with the receipts\r\nand upon payment the loan account was credited with the full amount\r\npaid.  In some cases the discrepancy was augmented by the purchase of\r\nbonds and the payment of a premium, as was done in the second term of\r\nGeneral Jackson.  The investigation showed that the discrepancy was\r\nonly apparent, and the criticisms and complaints ceased.\r\n\r\nDuring my administration of the Treasury Department, the government of\r\nthe Territory of Alaska was in my hands.  The legislation of Congress\r\nwas brief and indefinite and the only officers were collectors of\r\ncustoms, treasury agents and the revenue cutter officials.  The\r\nprincipal topics of thought were the exclusion of liquors and firearms\r\nand the protection of the fur seal fishery.  During the session of the\r\nForty-first Congress a bill was passed which required the Secretary to\r\nlease the seal fishery to the best bidder, with a preference to the\r\ncompany which was then engaged in the fishery.  On the question of the\r\nnature of the preference I took the opinion of the Attorney-General in\r\nadvance of the contract.  At that time I was opposed to any system of\r\nleasing and I so advised the House of Representatives in a report upon\r\nthe subject.  Congress, however, adopted the system of leasing and upon\r\nexperience that system was shown to be more advantageous to the\r\ncountry.  The value of the fur seal fishery depends upon the market for\r\nthe dressed furs, and the value of the dressed furs depends upon the\r\nfashions, and the fashions are manipulated by the producers of the\r\nvaried competing goods.  The Government could never engage in the\r\nbusiness of promoting fashions and training the markets.  Fur seal\r\nskins have only a moderate commercial value when the fashion is not\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe question of the claim on Behring Sea was not then much considered.\r\nBy the law of nations it is difficult to maintain the position that\r\nthat vast body of salt water can be treated as a closed sea, but there\r\nare peculiarities which distinguish it from other bodies of water as\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, which are partially\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nRussia for a long time was the possessor of the adjacent mainland and\r\nof the islands which mark the limits and in a degree enclose the sea.\r\nThat country claimed jurisdiction over the water.  That claim was\r\nknown and its validity was not disputed seriously.  By the treaty\r\nRussia ceded about one half of the sea to the United States.  Russia\r\nand the United States are the countries directly interested.  England\r\nhas no territorial rights and therefore she has no interest that is\r\nnot common to other nations.  The United States and Russia are\r\ninterested in the seal fishery which can be preserved only by the\r\nprotection of the animals in Behring Sea.  It may be claimed fairly\r\nthat Russia and the United State have property in these animals due to\r\nthe fact that they gather upon the territory of the countries at\r\ncertain seasons of the year.  At other seasons they roam over the water\r\nas other animals roam over the land.  They are, at least, partially\r\ndomesticated.  They are accustomed to the presence of the inhabitants\r\nof the islands which they occupy as breeding grounds and which they\r\nvisit annually.  Moreover, England has an interest in the preservation\r\nof the fishery.  The skins are dressed in London, and thus far no one\r\nhas been found, either in Europe or in the United States, who can\r\ncompete with the London workmen.  For the purpose of protecting and\r\npreserving the seal fishery, Behring Sea ought to be treated as a\r\nclosed sea.  For general commercial purposes it may be used as other\r\nparts of the ocean are used.\r\n\r\nAt a time, while I was Secretary of the Treasury, when I was detained\r\nat my lodgings by a slight illness, I received a visit from William E.\r\nDodge a New York merchant and an importer of tin, whom I had known some\r\nyears before when I was a member of Congress.  He said that he had\r\ncalled to see me in regard to charges against his house preferred by\r\nthe revenue officers relating to the importation of tin.  I said, what\r\nwas true, that I had not heard of the charges and that I had never\r\nsuspected his house of any wrong-doing in their business.  His\r\nstatement in reply was a great surprise to me.  He said that if there\r\nwas anything which appeared to be wrong, or that was in fact a\r\nviolation of law, the error or wrong was unintentional--that he and his\r\npartners intended to act always in good faith.  He then stated that\r\nthe claim amounted to more than two hundred thousand dollars, and he\r\nproposed then and there to pay the amount claimed, coupled, however,\r\nwith the condition that the payment should be kept secret.  I replied\r\nthat I could not take the money upon such terms and that secrecy was\r\nimpossible.  Upon his statement there were three persons besides\r\nourselves who had knowledge of the existence of the charges and the\r\npayment of money must come to the knowledge of the Treasury officials.\r\nI then said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dodge, you cannot afford to pay this money.  If you are innocent\r\nyou should contest the matter in the courts, and if you convince the\r\njudge, even if you are technically wrong, that there was no intent to\r\ndefraud the Government the Secretary can remit all the penalty, leaving\r\nyou to pay the duty.\"  His counsel, if they were competent, must have\r\ngiven him similar advice and yet he paid voluntarily, about two hundred\r\nand seventy-six thousand dollars to the officials in New York, of\r\nwhich he and his friends proceeded to complain.  There was a suit, but\r\nit was the duty of the firm to contest the claim of the Government,\r\nif they had a defence.  And if they had had a defence they were in no\r\ndanger even if they had violated the law ignorantly, for no Secretary\r\nwould have allowed honest men to suffer for an ignorant violation of\r\nthe revenue laws.  Senator Edmunds placed upon the records of the\r\nSenate a full statement of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\nTHE MINT BILL AND THE \"CRIME OF 1873\"\r\n\r\nOf the many measures of my administration of the Treasury Department,\r\nthe Mint Bill of 1873 is the only one which has been made a party\r\nissue, and which has entered permanently into the policy of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, in the year 1869, I came to the head of the\r\nTreasury Department.  At an early day my attention was directed to\r\nthe disordered condition of the mint service, which was then, as it\r\never had been, without a responsible head.  The proceedings at the\r\nmints were unsystematic, and I resolved upon an attempt to codify the\r\nlaws and to place the administration in the hands of a recognized,\r\nresponsible officer.  President Grant appointed John Jay Knox\r\ncomptroller of the currency.  For many years Mr. Knox had held the\r\noffice of deputy comptroller.  He had been a careful, constant student,\r\nand he was already a recognized authority in financial matters.\r\n\r\nI appointed Mr. Knox commissioner to codify the mint laws and to\r\nsuggest alterations.  He was assisted by Dr. Linderman, then an eminent\r\nexpert in the theory and practice of coinage, by Mr. Patterson,\r\nsuperintendent of the mint at Philadelphia, and by others.\r\n\r\nWhen the codification of the laws relating to the mint service had been\r\ncompleted the statute, as passed, contained seventy-one sections,\r\nincluding a number of new provisions.  The political and personal\r\ncontroversy of twenty years and more was directed to a single section,\r\nwhich was in these words:  \"No coins, either of gold, silver, or minor\r\ncoinage, shall hereafter be issued from the mints other than those of\r\nthe denominations, standards and weights herein set forth.\"  The\r\ncoinage of the silver dollar piece was discontinued in the bill as\r\nprepared by the commissioners and the purpose to discontinue its\r\ncoinage was thus announced in the report that was made to Congress:\r\n\r\n\"The coinage of the silver dollar piece, the history of which is here\r\ngiven, is discontinued in the proposed bill. . . . The present gold\r\ndollar piece is made the dollar unit in the proposed bill, and the\r\nsilver piece is discontinued.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to\r\nrecognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard.  I was of the\r\nopinion then, as I am of the opinion now, that nations cannot escape\r\nfrom the gold standard in all inter-state transactions.  The value of\r\nevery article is resolved finally by the ascertainment of its value\r\nin gold.  Silver or paper may be used for domestic purposes, but the\r\nvalue of that silver or paper is determined by its value in gold.\r\n\r\nIn America, as in England, all the attempts to fix a ratio between\r\ngold and silver coins and to maintain that ratio in business had\r\nfailed, and hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a\r\ndouble standard, reserving in mind, however, the possibility that an\r\nagreement by commercial countries might overcome the difficulty.  That\r\npossibility has now disappeared.  The history of the United States is\r\nan instructive history.  The coin ratio between gold and silver was\r\nfixed in Mr. Hamilton's time and with the concurrence of Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 silver was at a premium upon the legal ratio between gold and\r\nsilver coins, and such had been the fact from the year 1837, and\r\nprobably from the year 1792.  Indeed, there has never been a day,\r\nfrom the organization of the government, when the actual standard was\r\nsilver.  Until the act of 1878 was passed, silver coins had had no\r\nappreciable influence upon the volume of currency or the business of\r\nthe country.  The total coinage of silver dollars had been 8,000,000\r\npieces only.  The coinage was suspended in 1805 or 1806, and the silver\r\ndollars had been exported or they had disappeared in melting pots.\r\nSuch was the commercial demand for American silver coins that in 1853\r\nCongress authorized the debasement of the subsidiary silver coins as\r\nthe only means of securing their circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite doubtful whether in the year 1860 there was a person living\r\nwho had seen an American silver dollar doing duty in the channels of\r\ntrade.  From 1806 to 1873 the business standard of the country was the\r\ngold standard.  Silver had been recognized in the Coinage Act, but\r\npractically it had not played any part in the financial policy or\r\nfortunes of the country.\r\n\r\nThe choice of gold as the standard was not due to hostility to silver\r\nor to the silver mining interests, but to the well grounded opinion\r\nthat gold was a universal currency, while in some countries, as in\r\nEngland and Germany, silver coins were not a debt-paying currency.\r\n\r\nThese--within the limits of a statement--are the reasons for the\r\ndemonetization of the silver dollar and the adoption of the single gold\r\nstandard.  The measure was in accord with my policy, and it was in\r\naccord with the unbiased judgment of the commission.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular instance in legislative proceedings that a measure\r\nthat had no active support and that was free from opposition at its\r\nenactment should be assailed vigorously after the lapse of years and\r\nthrough a long period of time.  The measure was soon followed by the\r\ndepreciation of silver and coincident with that change came the\r\nattacks upon the Mint Bill, and the denunciation of the \"Crime of 1873.\"\r\n\r\nThe charges were two:\r\n\r\nFirst:  The authors of the change had been corrupted by English gold\r\nthrough one Ernest Seyd, a writer on economic topics.  It was alleged\r\nthat Seyd came to this country at the time when the measure was under\r\nconsideration.  Seyd was not living when the charges were made, but the\r\nfact of a visit to this country was denied by his son.  Hon. Samuel\r\nHooper was chairman of the Committee on Coinage.  In the search for\r\ninformation Mr. Hooper invited Mr. Seyd to give him his opinion.  Seyd\r\nwas a writer, a man of good reputation, and a bimetallist.  In a letter\r\nto Mr. Hooper, which is still in existence, and which is printed in the\r\n_Congressional Record,_ Seyd condemned the demonetization of the silver\r\ndollar.  His letter was dated at London, February 17, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe second charge was secrecy.  The answer to this charge was to be\r\nfound in historical facts.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is this:  Mr. Knox's report contained two specific\r\nstatements that it was a purpose of the bill to prohibit the coinage\r\nof the silver dollar; the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for\r\nthe year 1872 made a specific recommendation to that effect; the bill\r\nwas printed six times; it was considered in each House during the\r\nForty-first and Forty-second Congresses; the precise question in\r\ncontroversy was the subject of discussion, and two years and ten months\r\nwere given to the consideration of the bill.\r\n\r\nThe bill was discussed in the House of Representatives.  Mr. Reed has\r\nstated that the report of the debate covers one hundred and ninety-six\r\ncolumns of the _Congressional Record_.  Senator Jones, in his report\r\nof 1876, as chairman of the Silver Commission, refers to the debate in\r\nthese words:  \"In the brief discussion on the bill in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the principal reason assigned in favor of those\r\nsections which interdicted the future coinage of the silver dollar was\r\nthat its value was three per cent greater than the value of the gold\r\ndollar.\"  Thus Senator Jones admits that the debate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives was upon the question of the abolition of the silver\r\ndollar, and he recognizes his knowledge of the fact of the debate.\r\n\r\nFinally the bill passed the Senate without one dissenting vote.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of silver has not been due to any legislation in America\r\nor Europe, nor to any decrees or despotic policy in Asia, but to the\r\ninventive faculties of one Charles Burleigh, of Fitchburg,\r\nMassachusetts, the inventor of the power drill.\r\n\r\nIf through him many silver mines have been rendered valueless, so it\r\nis to him that the world is indebted for a new application of force by\r\nwhich mountains are penetrated and mining in all its forms is carried\r\non at one fourth part of the former cost.  Every step in civilization,\r\nevery advance movement that we call progress, is a peril to many and a\r\nruin to some.  By one stroke of genius, and limiting our thoughts to\r\none only of its many consequences we may say that Burleigh has made\r\ngold so abundant and cheap that all substitutes for a currency from\r\nwampum to silver must soon disappear.\r\n\r\nThere is historical evidence tending to show that the representatives\r\nof the silver mining interest had sufficient and worthy reasons for\r\nassenting to the suspension of the silver dollar.  In 1872 silver was\r\nat a slight premium as compared with gold.  Therefore the privilege of\r\ncoinage of the dollar was of no advantage to the owners of bullion.\r\n\r\nThe Mint Bill had a new and attractive feature.  It provided for the\r\ncoinage of a dollar that was to contain 420 grains of standard silver,\r\nand was to be known as the trade dollar.\r\n\r\nThis passage may be found in my report to Congress for the year 1872:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, in renewing the recommendations heretofore made for the\r\npassage of the Mint Bill, I suggest such alterations as will prohibit\r\nthe coinage of silver for circulation in this country, but that\r\nauthority be given for the coinage of a silver dollar that shall be as\r\nvaluable as the Mexican dollar and to be furnished at its actual cost.\"\r\n\r\nThe dollar was coined and it was known as the Trade Dollar.  It\r\ncontained 420 grains of standard silver.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican dollar which contained about 416 grains, was then sold at\r\na premium, and it was used extensively in the China and India trade.\r\n\r\nIt was my expectation and the expectation of all concerned, that the\r\ntrade dollar, from its added value, would take the place of the Mexican\r\ndollar in the immense trade of the East.  My own confidence was great.\r\nIndeed, the thought of failure never occurred to me.  Unfortunately,\r\nthe stolidity of the Chinese and the force of habit among that people\r\nwere not considered by us.  From long use they had become accustomed\r\nto the Mexican dollar.  They refused our trade dollar, notwithstanding\r\nits greater weight.\r\n\r\nWe coined and put into circulation, at home and abroad, about\r\n36,000,000 pieces, many of which were afterwards recoined as legal\r\ntender dollars under a special act of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith the failure of that undertaking came the crusade against the act\r\nof 1873.  Whether the two events sustained to each other the relation\r\nof cause and effect, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that Senator Stewart of Nevada was assenting to the\r\ndemonetization of the silver dollar derives support from the fact that,\r\nin the month of February, 1874, he indorsed the gold standard in two\r\nspeeches, delivered, respectively, on the 11th and 20th days of that\r\nmonth.  On the 11th he said:  \"I want the standard gold, and no paper\r\nmoney not redeemable in gold.\"  On the 20th he added:  \"Gold is the\r\nuniversal standard of the world.  Everybody knows what a dollar in gold\r\nis worth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain that in the month of February, 1874, when the contents\r\nof the Mint Bill were in the public statutes, the demonetization of the\r\nsilver dollar, and the recognition of the gold dollar as the unit of\r\nvalue, had not affected the judgment nor disturbed the sensibilities of\r\nthe advocates of silver.\r\n\r\nI dismiss this branch of the subject with the observation that the act\r\nof 1873 placed the United States in a commanding position in regard to\r\nthe use of silver.  If that metal had continued to maintain its\r\nsupremacy upon the ratio then established between gold and silver coin,\r\nthere could have arisen no demand for the coinage of silver.  If, on\r\nthe other hand, silver should depreciate, the government might, at\r\nits pleasure, use, or it might decline to use, that metal as coin.\r\n\r\nI now pass to a part of the history of the controversy not heretofore\r\nconsidered in public discussions, from which it will appear that the\r\ntrusted representatives of the silver interest put aside the most\r\ninviting opportunity, if not the only opportunity, for the adoption of\r\nthe bimetallic system by the commercial nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1873 prepared the way for the use of silver by the\r\ncommercial nations of the world, upon an agreed ratio with gold, if\r\nindeed, the possibility of such an arrangement ever existed.  We were\r\nupon a gold basis; the balance of trade, by groups of years, was in our\r\nfavor; we had a gold revenue from customs of about $200,000,000, and\r\nthe excess of Treasury receipts over expenditures was nearly\r\n$100,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\nIf we had chosen to accumulate gold and postpone payments upon the\r\nPublic Debt, we could have brought the nations of the earth to our feet.\r\n\r\nIt was under circumstances thus favorable for negotiations for the use\r\nof silver that the Silver Commission of 1876 was constituted, and\r\nauthorized, among other things, to inquire \"into the policy of the\r\nrestoration of the double standard in this country, and if restored,\r\nwhat the legal relation between the two coins of silver and gold,\r\nshould be.\"\r\n\r\nThis authority opened a way for the introduction of a policy on the\r\npart of the United States looking to an arrangement for the use of\r\nsilver by the states of Europe, and on that authority the commission\r\ndealt with the project of an international bimetallic system.\r\n\r\nThe commission consisted of eight persons.  Senator Jones was the\r\nchairman, and Mr. Bland, of Missouri, was an influential member.  It\r\nwas my fortune to be of the commission and it was my fortune also to\r\nbe alone in opinion upon the main questions that were treated in the\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commission consisted of Messrs. Jones, Bogy,\r\nWillard, Bland and Groesbeck.  They favored the remonetization of the\r\nsilver dollar, and that without delay.\r\n\r\nOf the points made in their report, I mention these.  They said:  \"The\r\nsupply of gold is diminishing, being now but little more than one half\r\nwhat it was in 1852, and is always so fitful and irregular from the\r\nmethod of its production that it is ill-suited to be a sole measure of\r\nvalue.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement as a statement of an existing fact was wide of the\r\ntruth, and as a prophecy it was as fallacious as are the prophecies\r\nwhich predict the destruction of the world.  From 1851 to 1855 the\r\nannual gold product of the world was 6,410,324 ounces.  From 1876 to\r\n1880 the annual gold product of the world was 5,543,110 ounces.  The\r\ngold product of the latter period was eighty-six per cent of the gold\r\nproduct of the former period.\r\n\r\nFar wide of the truth were the predictions of the majority in regard\r\nto the future product of gold.  For the year 1894 the product was\r\n8,737,788 ounces, or about thirty-seven per cent over the product of\r\n1851-'55.\r\n\r\nThey, the majority, said:  \"No increase in the yield of silver in the\r\nimmediate future seems upon the whole to be probable.\"  The commission\r\nsaid further:  \"The exchanges of the world, and especially of this\r\ncountry, are continually and largely increasing; while the supplies of\r\nboth the precious metals, taken together, if not diminishing, are at\r\nleast stationary, and the supply of gold, taken by itself, is falling\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nEach of these two statements in regard to the precious metals was a\r\nserious error, and in their controlling influence upon the judgment of\r\nthe commission they were fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThe gold product of the world in 1876 was 5,016,488 ounces.  In 1894\r\nthe product had risen to 8,737,788 ounces, a gain of more than\r\nseventy-four per cent in the short period of eighteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the product of silver was 67,753,125 ounces, and in 1894 it\r\nwas 167,752,561 ounces, a gain of about 147 per cent in eighteen years.\r\n\r\nUpon these errors the majority of the commission based a policy by\r\nwhich the only opportunity that the country ever had for the\r\nestablishment of a bimetallic system which should include the\r\ncommercial nations of Europe, was put aside and forever lost.\r\n\r\nIf, in 1876, I had anticipated the immense increase in the product of\r\nsilver, I might have hesitated, but in the view that I was then able\r\nto command I had great confidence that a bimetallic arrangement might\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commission favored bimetallism but they demanded,\r\nfirst, the remonetization of the silver dollar.  On the other hand,\r\nI claimed that all thought of the further use of silver should be\r\npostponed until the attempt to secure the co-operation of other\r\ncountries had been tried faithfully.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the majority of the commission prevailed, and it was\r\nconsummated by the Statute of 1878, which was passed over the veto of\r\nPresident Hayes, and which authorized the coinage of the silver dollar.\r\n\r\nWhen we had accepted silver, when we had abandoned the vantage ground\r\nthat we had occupied, it was in vain that we solicited the co-operation\r\nof England, France and Germany.  The adoption by the United States of\r\na silver-using policy led the statesmen of those countries to\r\nanticipate the more extended and continuous use of silver leaving to\r\nthem a monopoly of gold, while we should sink financially to the level\r\nof the degraded states of the world.  That catastrophe we have escaped\r\nafter an experience of twenty-five years, and then only by the\r\ncombined efforts of the two great political parties.\r\n\r\nI submit brief extracts from the report of the majority of the\r\ncommission and from my individual report of 1876, that our relative\r\npositions may be understood.\r\n\r\nThe commission said:  \"We believe that the remonetization of silver in\r\nthis country will have a powerful influence in preventing, and probably\r\nwill prevent, the demonetization of silver in France and in other\r\nEuropean countries in which the double standard is still legally and\r\ntheoretically maintained.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the majority said:  \"It may be added that a legislative\r\nremonetization on the relation to gold of 15.5 to 1 accomplishes\r\nwithout delay all the objects of the proposition for an international\r\nconference, which is urged from various quarters.\"\r\n\r\nThat I may place myself where I stood in 1876 I present brief extracts\r\nfrom my report of that year.\r\n\r\nFirst I said:  \"There can be but one standard of value in any country\r\nat the same time, and a successful use of gold and silver\r\nsimultaneously can be effected only by their consolidation upon an\r\nagreed ratio of value, and by the concurrence of the commercial nations\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned is also of opinion that it is expedient for this\r\nGovernment to extend an invitation to the commercial nations of the\r\nworld to join in convention for the purpose of considering whether it\r\nis wise to provide by treaties and concurrent legislation for the use\r\nof both silver and gold in all such nations upon a fixed relative\r\nvaluation of the two metals; and, finally, that until such an\r\nagreement between this Government and other commercial nations can be\r\neffected, the United States should pursue the existing policy in regard\r\nto the resumption of specie payments.\"\r\n\r\nFurther I said:  \"It is to be apprehended that the remonetization of\r\nsilver by the United States at the present time would be followed by\r\nsuch a depreciation in its value as to furnish a reason against the\r\nadoption of the plan by the rest of the world, and that an independent\r\nmovement on our part would increase the difficulties rather than\r\ndiminish them.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts shall suffice.  I now repeat the assertion with which I\r\nintroduced this topic, viz.:  That in 1876 the majority of the Silver\r\nCommission put aside the most favorable opportunity, indeed the only\r\nopportunity, that the country has ever had for the organization of a\r\nuniversal system of bimetallism.\r\n\r\nOf that majority, Senator Jones of Nevada, and Representative Bland, of\r\nMissouri, were the leading members.  If in defence or in extenuation\r\nof the policy of the majority it shall be said that the United States\r\nhas not remonetized silver, and that, therefore, the policy of the\r\nmajority has not been tested, a partial rejoinder, if not, indeed, a\r\nsatisfactory reply, may be deduced from the facts that between the\r\nyears 1878 and the year 1893 the Government coined more than\r\n400,000,000 silver dollars, and yet, in that period of time, silver\r\nbullion fell from 1.15 plus per ounce to .65 plus per ounce.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the product of silver in the United States\r\nhas increased with the demand for silver.  Upon the passage of the\r\nSherman Bill the product advanced from 45,000,000 ounces in 1888 to an\r\naverage of 55,000,000 ounces from 1889 to 1893, inclusive.  Upon the\r\nrepeal of that act the product fell to 49,000,000 ounces in 1894.\r\n\r\nIt is not only probable, it is certain, that with every increasing\r\ndemand for silver there will be an added supply.  Consider what has\r\nhappened since the appearance of the inventions of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\nThe world's annual product of silver from 1493 to 1865, inclusive, was\r\n16,887,157 ounces.  The largest annual product was from 1861 to 1865,\r\nwhen it reached 35,401,972 ounces.  From 1866 to 1894 inclusive, the\r\nannual average product was 114,326,397 ounces.  In 1894 the product was\r\n167,752,561 ounces, which, as will be observed, was about nine times\r\nthe annual product from 1493 to 1865.\r\n\r\nFrom 1876 to 1894 the business of silver mining was increased 147 per\r\ncent.  Can any one name any other business or pursuit in which there\r\nwas a like increase?  And is not the inference justified that the\r\nprofits have been large and tempting, notwithstanding the\r\ndemonetization of silver in some countries and the suspension of\r\ncoinage in other countries?\r\n\r\nI turn now to the future, and first as to the possibility of the\r\nfurther use of silver as currency.\r\n\r\nI assume that in countries where the standard is gold there may be a\r\nconsiderable use of silver, as in the United States to-day.\r\n\r\nAn international bimetallic system, binding nations to each other for\r\na definite term of years, is a proposition involving large\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nIf in 1885 it was not practicable to secure the adoption of the\r\nbimetallic system, when silver was worth eighty-four cents per ounce,\r\nwhat is the prospect of its adoption when silver is worth only sixty-\r\nfour cents per ounce, with an annually increasing product and a\r\ndiminishing price?\r\n\r\nWhat remains?  This, possibly:  That the nations may agree to purchase\r\neach a per cent of a fixed amount of silver as the product of each\r\nyear.  This scheme might prove, and probably it would prove, to be only\r\na temporary expedient.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase in the business of silver mining is evidence that\r\nthe profits are far in excess of the profits that are gained in other\r\npursuits.  The increase in product is likely to be followed by a fall\r\nin price.  Such are the resources of the earth that an increase in the\r\ndemand for silver will be followed by an increase in the supply.\r\n\r\nGold mining is obedient to the same law.  From 1876 to 1894 the product\r\nincreased 74 per cent.  That ratio of increase is likely to continue.\r\nThe world is not in peril of a gold famine.  Gold as a currency,\r\npassing from hand to hand, will be used less and less.  Substitutes,\r\nfor which gold can be obtained, will be preferred.  The volume of\r\ncurrency in a country is not limited by the amount of gold that a\r\ncountry may possess.  It may increase the amount of subsidiary coin\r\nvery largely, and it may add to the sum of paper money, provided that\r\nthat paper money is always redeemable in gold.\r\n\r\nNor does the quantity of gold in a country determine the price of\r\ncommodities, except as that gold is a part of the total volume of the\r\ncurrency of the country.  The volume of currency as a whole is the\r\nforce by which the salable value of commodities is affected.\r\n\r\nIn truth, gold plays a small part only in actual business.  It is a\r\nregulator of business rather than an active instrument for the\r\ntransaction of business.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the\r\nuse of gold in business is limited to a small fraction of one per cent\r\nof the aggregate transactions in countries where gold is the standard.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that in the near future the world is to meet a\r\nsurfeit of gold, as it is now meeting a surfeit of silver.  Yet even\r\nthen its capacity as a standard will not be affected.  History does\r\nnot carry us to a time when gold was not the recognized standard for\r\nthe measurement of every other kind of property, and that not by one\r\ntribe or people only, but by mankind in every clime and in every stage\r\nof savageness or of civilization.\r\n\r\nAs the Mint Bill and the demonetization of silver have occupied the\r\nattention of the country for a third of a century, and as there may be\r\na revival of the controversy at a time in the future I have thought it\r\nwise for me to make a record of the facts in the most enduring form at\r\nmy command.\r\n\r\nAt the end this is my claim for the Mint Bill of 1873:  It established\r\nthe gold standard for the United States for all time.  All the\r\nsubsequent legislation has rested upon the fact that the Statute of\r\n1873 made the gold dollar the standard of value in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\nBLACK FRIDAY--SEPTEMBER 24, 1869\r\n\r\nSo much time has passed since September 24, 1869, that there may be a\r\nlarge public who may become interested in a review of the events of the\r\nspring and summer of that year which culminated in Wall Street, New\r\nYork, in the transactions and experiences of the day known as \"Black\r\nFriday.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Forty-first Congress assembled in December of that year, the\r\nHouse of Representatives directed the Committee on Banking and\r\nCurrency \"to investigate the causes that led to the unusual and\r\nextraordinary fluctuations of gold in the city of New York, from the\r\n21st to the 27th of September, 1869.\"  The committee made a report\r\nwhich was printed under date of March 1, 1870, and which may be found\r\nin a volume entitled \"Garfield's Report on the Gold Panic\r\nInvestigation.\"  From that report it appears that certain persons in\r\nthe city of New York entered into an arrangement, or understanding, or\r\ncombination, as early as the month of April, 1869, for the purpose of\r\nforcing the price of gold artificially to a rate far beyond what might\r\nbe called the natural price.  The committee, of which General Garfield\r\nwas chairman, characterized the combination as a conspiracy.\r\nTechnically and in a legal point of view the parties concerned could\r\nnot be treated properly as conspirators.  It does not appear that they\r\ncontemplated the violation of any law, but only a policy by which gold\r\nmight be advanced from time to time, and out of which advance large\r\nsums of money might be realized by those who were holders of gold.\r\nUpon that theory Jay Gould and James Fisk, Jr., who were the leaders\r\nand organizers of the combination, with their associates, made large\r\npurchases of gold at prices varying from thirty to thirty-five per\r\ncent premium.  At the close of the month of April, the price of gold,\r\nnot then, as far as known, under the influence of any speculative\r\nmovement, was at a premium of about thirty-four per cent.  The\r\nindications were that, during the months of May and June, the parties\r\ninterested in the combination made large purchases.  By the 20th of\r\nMay the price had reached a premium of forty-four per cent.  From\r\nthat time onward, until the last of July, the premium diminished, and\r\nat that date the rate was thirty-six per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the Treasury Department in March, there had not been\r\nsales of gold nor purchases of bonds by the Treasury Department as a\r\npolicy, and but few transactions on either side had been made by my\r\npredecessors in office.  As early as the 12th day of May I commenced\r\nthe purchase of bonds for the sinking fund and for the reduction of the\r\ninterest-bearing public debt.  The total purchases during the year\r\n1869 amounted to something more than $88,000,000, for which there was\r\npaid in currency $102,000,000 and a margin over.  At that time, the\r\ncustoms receipts were in gold exclusively, and the purchase of bonds\r\ncould only be made by a sale of gold or by a direct purchase of bonds\r\nto be paid for in gold.  Suggestions were made by bankers and others\r\nin the city of New York, and perhaps elsewhere, that the purchase of\r\nbonds should be made in gold.  This suggestion was not acceptable to\r\nme, and upon the ground that the sale of gold would be limited to those\r\nwho had bonds, or who could procure bonds, for the payment of gold.\r\nFrom the 29th of April, when the first sale of gold was made, until the\r\n31st day of December, the sales amounted to something more than\r\n$53,000,000, and the proceeds to something over $70,000,000.  The\r\ndifference in the amount realized from the sale of gold and the amount\r\npaid for bonds purchased was met by the excess of receipts over the\r\nexpenditures of the Government during that period.\r\n\r\nAs having some connection, and perhaps an important connection, with\r\nwhat is to be said hereafter touching General Grant's action in the\r\ndays of September, when the speculation was going on, I think it proper\r\nto make a statement of my relations to the President.  I had declined\r\nthe office of Secretary of the Treasury, and on the morning of my\r\nnomination to the Senate I wrote a letter to Mr. Washburne, through\r\nwhom the invitation of the President that I should accept the office\r\nwas made, requesting him and urging him to say to the President that\r\nI was unwilling to accept the place.  My nomination was sent to the\r\nSenate and confirmed, and as there seemed to be no alternative for me,\r\nI entered upon the duties of the office.  Due in part to these\r\ncircumstances, as I think, the President accepted the idea that the\r\nmanagement of the Treasury Department was in my hands, and from first\r\nto last, during the four years that I was in his Cabinet, his acts and\r\nhis conversation proceeded upon that idea.  Moreover, he was influenced\r\nby a military view that an officer who was charged with the conduct of\r\na business, or of a undertaking, should be left free to act, that he\r\nshould be made responsible, and that, in case of failure, the\r\nconsequences should rest upon him.  It happened, and as a plan on my\r\npart, that neither the President nor the Cabinet was made responsible\r\nfor what was done in the Treasury Department.  Hence it was that I\r\npresented to the Cabinet but two questions.  One of these was of no\r\nconsiderable consequence.  The other related to the political effect\r\nthat might follow a loan that I contemplated making upon certain terms\r\nin the year 1872, when the Presidential contest was pending.  In the\r\nline of these views, it happened that I announced my purpose to\r\npurchase bonds in May, 1869, without conference either with the\r\nCabinet or with the President.  When the announcement was made, there\r\nwas a slight advance in bonds.  In order that the business interests\r\nof the country might not be influenced by an apprehension that changes\r\nmight take place in the policy of the Department, I announced (as\r\nstated in Chapter XXXIII) at the beginning of each month the sales of\r\ngold and the purchases of bonds that were to be made during the coming\r\nmonth.  Those announcements were sent out on the evening of Sunday,\r\neither the last Sunday of the closing month or the first Sunday of the\r\nopening month.  The despatches were written by myself Sunday evening,\r\nand sent to the Assistant Treasurer at New York.  A copy was given to\r\nthe agent of the Associated Press, that the public might be informed\r\nin the morning of the policy for the ensuing month, and that there\r\nshould be no opportunity for speculation by persons who might obtain\r\ninformation in advance of the general public.  Unhappily, this policy\r\nwas made the basis of the proceedings in New York which culminated in\r\n\"Black Friday.\"  The parties interested--I do not call them\r\nconspirators--assumed that for thirty days the policy of the department\r\nas to the sale of gold and the purchase of bonds would remain\r\nunchanged, and on that basis they proceeded to make arrangements for\r\nthe advance in gold.  Not satisfied with that policy, which was\r\ndesigned to save the business community from unnecessary apprehensions,\r\nan attempt was made to induce me to make an announcement for two or\r\nthree months.  Such suggestions were made in letters that I received\r\nfrom interested parties in the city of New York.\r\n\r\nSpeculation in gold was not all on one side.  There were speculators\r\nwho were anxious to break down the price of gold, and between the lines\r\nI could read the condition of the respective parties from whom I\r\nreceived letters.  Under date of September 23, I received a letter\r\nfrom a prominent house in New York in which the writer said:  \"I am\r\nactuated to again portray to you the state of financial affairs as they\r\nnow exist in this city.  The speculative advance in gold has brought\r\nlegitimate business almost to a standstill, owing to the apprehension\r\nof a corner, which from appearances may appear at any moment.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not follow that the writer of the letter was \"short on gold,\" as\r\nthe phrase is.  I had, however, in my possession at the time a list of\r\npersons in New York who were supposed to be contestants, some for an\r\nadvance in gold and others for a fall.  The writer of the letter was\r\namong those whose names had been given to me as speculators for a fall\r\nin gold.  In this connection I may say that it was no part of my policy\r\nto regulate affairs in Wall Street or State Street or Lombard Street.\r\nUntil it became apparent that the operations in New York affected\r\nlargely and seriously the business interests of the country, and until\r\nit became apparent that the Treasury receipts were diminished by the\r\npanic that had taken possession of the public, I refrained from any\r\ninterference with those who were engaged either in forcing up or\r\nforcing down the price of gold.\r\n\r\nUnder date of the 24th day of September, I received a letter from my\r\nspecial and trusted correspondent in the city of New York in which I\r\nfind this statement:  \"This has been the most dreadful day I have ever\r\nseen in this city.  While gold was jumping from forty-three to sixty-\r\none the excitement was painful.  Old, conservative merchants looked\r\naghast, nobody was in their offices, and the agony depicted on the\r\nfaces of men who crowded the streets made one feel as if Gettysburg\r\nhad been lost and that the rebels were marching down Broadway.  Friends\r\nof the Administration openly stated that the President or yourself must\r\nhave given these men to feel that you would not interfere with them or\r\nthey would never dare to rush gold up so rapidly.  In truth, many\r\nparties of real responsibility and friends of the Government openly\r\ndeclared that somebody in Washington must be in this combination.\"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence in this quotation unfolds the policy which had guided\r\nGould and Fisk and their associates from April to the culmination of\r\ntheir undertaking, the 24th day of September.  As far as I know, the\r\neffort had been directed chiefly to the support of a false theory that\r\nthe President was opposed to the sale of gold, especially during the\r\nautumn months, when a large amount of currency is required, or in those\r\ndays was supposed to be required, for \"the moving,\" as it was called,\r\nof the produce of the West to the sea coast for shipment to Europe.\r\nThey even went so far as to allege that the President had ordered the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to suspend the sale of gold during the\r\nmonth of September, for which there was no foundation whatever.\r\nIndeed, up to the 22d of September, when I introduced the subject of\r\nthe price of gold to the President, he had neither said nor done\r\nanything, except to write a letter from New York City under date of\r\nSeptember 12, 1869, in the following words:\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY, _September_ 12, 1869.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:  I leave here for western Pennsylvania to-morrow morning and\r\nwill not reach Washington before the middle or last of next week.  Had\r\nI known before making my arrangements for starting that you would be in\r\nthis city early this week, I would have remained to meet you.  I am\r\nsatisfied that on your arrival you will be met by the bulls and bears\r\nof Wall Street, and probably by merchants, too, to induce you to sell\r\ngold, or pay the November interest in advance, on the one side, and to\r\nhold fast on the other.  The fact is, a desperate struggle is now\r\ntaking place, and each party wants the Government to help him out.  I\r\nwrite this letter to advise you of what I think you may expect, to put\r\nyou on your guard.\r\n\r\nI think, from the lights before me, I would move on without change\r\nuntil the present struggle is over.  If you want to write me this week,\r\nmy address will be Washington, Pennsylvania.  I would like to hear\r\nyour experience with the factions, at all events, if they give you time\r\nto write.  No doubt you will have a better chance to judge than I,\r\nfor I have avoided general discussion on the subject.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nHon. GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,\r\n  _Secretary of Treasury_.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting, which was accidental, as far as the President was\r\nconcerned, on board one of Fisk and Gould's Fall River steamers, when\r\nhe was on his way to Boston, in June of that year, to attend the Peace\r\nJubilee, an attempt was made to commit General Grant to the policy of\r\nholding gold.  I was present on the trip with the President.  What\r\nhappened on the boat may be best given in the language of Mr. Fisk and\r\nMr. Gould.  Mr. Fisk, in his testimony before the committee, said:\r\n\r\n\"On our passage over to Boston with General Grant, we endeavored to\r\nascertain what his position in regard to the finances was.  We went\r\ndown to supper about nine o'clock, intending while we were there to\r\nhave this thing pretty thoroughly talked up, and, if possible, to\r\nrelieve him from any idea of putting the price of gold down.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gould's account before the committee was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At this supper the question came up about the state of the country,\r\nthe crops, prospects ahead, etc.  The President was a listener; the\r\nother gentlemen were discussing.  Some were in favor of Boutwell's\r\nselling gold, and some were opposed to it.  After they had all\r\ninterchanged their views, some one asked the President what his view\r\nwas.  He remarked that he thought there was a certain amount of\r\nfictitiousness about the prosperity of the country, and that the\r\nbubble might as well be tapped in one way as another. . . . We\r\nsupposed from that conversation that the President was a\r\ncontractionist.  His remark struck across us like a wet blanket.\"\r\n\r\nThe error of Fisk and Gould and their associates, from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the contest, was in the supposition that the President was\r\ntaking any part in the operations of the Treasury concerning the price\r\nof gold.  If he expressed any opinions outside in conversation, there\r\nwere no acts on his part in harmony with or in antagonism to the views\r\nhe entertained.  As a matter of fact, with the exception of the letter\r\nfrom the city of New York, he had no conference or correspondence with\r\nme up to the 22d day of September, when I called upon him, and gave\r\nhim a statement of the price of gold in the city of New York, and of\r\nthe nature and character of the combination that existed there, as far\r\nas it was understood by me.  Their policy was directed to two points:\r\nfirst, to influence the President, if possible, to interfere in a way\r\nto advance the price of gold; and, second, to satisfy their adherents\r\nand opponents that the President either had so interfered or would so\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nEven Fisk and Gould may at a period of time have rested in the belief\r\nthat the President either had interfered or that he would interfere.\r\nTheir confidence was in Mr. A. R. Corbin, a brother-in-law of the\r\nPresident, who, under the influence of various considerations, which\r\nappear to have been personal and pecuniary to a very large extent, lent\r\nhimself to the task of influencing the President.  As a matter of fact,\r\nhis attempts were very feeble and misdirected and of no consequence\r\nwhatever.  Indeed, such is my opinion of the President, and such my\r\nbelief as to his opinion concerning Mr. Corbin, that nothing which Mr.\r\nCorbin did say, or could have said, did have or could have had the\r\nleast influence upon the President's opinion or conduct.  It is,\r\nhowever, also true that Fisk and Gould employed Corbin and gave him\r\nconsideration in their undertakings out of which he realized some\r\nmoney.  I received information, also, which may not have been true,\r\nthat they suggested to him that he might become president of the Tenth\r\nNational Bank, which had a very conspicuous part in the events which\r\nculminated in Black Friday.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to strengthen the impression that it was the purpose of the\r\nPresident to prevent the sale of gold was made through an article\r\nprepared by Mr. Corbin, probably under the direction of Mr. Gould and\r\nothers, which appeared finally, with some alterations and omissions, in\r\nthe New York _Times_ of the 25th of August.  It appears to have been\r\nthe purpose of the parties interested to mislead the _Times_ as to the\r\nauthorship of the article, and they secured the agency of Mr. James\r\nMcHenry, a prominent English capitalist, who called at the _Times_\r\noffice, and presented the article to Mr. Bigelow, the editor, as the\r\nopinion of a person in the intimate confidence of the President.  The\r\narticle was put in type and double leaded.  When so prepared,\r\nsuspicions were aroused, and the financial editor, Mr. Norvell, made\r\nvery important corrections, taking care to omit sentences and\r\nparagraphs that contained explicit statements as to the purposes of the\r\nPresident.  Some of the phrases omitted were in these words:  \"It may\r\nbe that further purchases of bonds will be made directly with gold.\"\r\n\"As gold accumulates, the less would be the premium upon it.  High\r\nprices for gold before the sale of our products would cause lower\r\nprices of gold after the sale of products.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the statements made which were preserved in the article as\r\nprinted finally were these:  \"The President evidently intends to pay\r\noff the 5-20s as rapidly as he may in gold\"; \"So far as current\r\nmovements of the Treasury are concerned, until crops are moved it is\r\nnot likely Treasury gold will be sold for currency to be locked up.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the appearance of this article, I received a letter from Mr.\r\nGould, dated the 30th of August, in which this sentence appears:  \"If\r\nthe New York _Times_ correctly reflects your financial policy during\r\nthe next three or four months; namely, to unloose the currency balance\r\nat the Treasury or keep it at the lowest possible figure, and also to\r\nrefrain during the same period from selling or putting gold on the\r\nmarket, thus preventing a depression of the premium at a season of the\r\nyear when the bulk of our agricultural products have to be marketed,\r\nthen I think the country peculiarly fortunate in having a financial\r\nhead who can take a broad view of the situation, and who realizes the\r\nimportance of settling the large balance of debt against us by the\r\nexport of our agricultural and mining products instead of bonds and\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\nOf my reply to that letter, the committee say:  \"The brief and formal\r\nreply of the Secretary gave Gould no clew to the purpose of the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of September 20, I received a letter from Gould to which I\r\nmade no reply.  Aside from the topics to which he directed my attention\r\nin the letter, it is the unavoidable inference from the context as a\r\nwhole that Gould had then no faith in the statements given to the\r\npublic that the President was in any manner pledged to interfere and\r\nprevent the sale of gold.  The following extracts from the letter of\r\nSeptember 20 are a full exposition of his policy and of the means on\r\nwhich he relied to advance the price of gold during the month of\r\nSeptember:\r\n\r\n\"On the subject of the price of gold and its effect upon the producing\r\ninterests of the West, permit me to say that during the months of\r\nSeptember of the past two years the price has averaged about forty-\r\nfive.  Gold must range this year at about that premium to enable the\r\nexport of the surplus crops of wheat and corn.  We have to compete with\r\nthe grain-producing countries bordering on the Black and Mediterranean\r\nseas, and it requires a premium of over forty per cent on gold to\r\nequalize our high-priced labor and long rail transportation to the\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\n\"My theory is to let gold go to a price that we can export our surplus\r\nproducts to pay our foreign debts, and the moment we turn the balance\r\nof trade in our favor gold will decline from natural causes.  In my\r\njudgment, the Government cannot afford to sell gold during the next\r\nthree months while the crops are being marketed, and if such a policy\r\nwere announced, it would immediately cause a high export of bread-\r\nstuffs and an active fall trade.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.  In addition to the above, if gold were put upon the market,\r\ngovernment bonds would decline to at least fifteen, leaving the\r\npurchases made by the Government in the past few months open to\r\ncriticism as showing a loss.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as the 20th of September, I had evidence satisfactory to me\r\nthat the Tenth National Bank in the city of New York was a party to the\r\nspeculation in gold, and that its assistance was rendered largely\r\nthrough the certification of checks drawn by the brokers, and largely\r\nin excess of the balances due them upon the books of the bank when the\r\ncertifications were made.  It appeared from the evidence submitted\r\nthat these certifications of checks in excess of the balances due to\r\nbrokers amounted to about $18,000,000 on the 22d and 23d of September,\r\nwhen the speculation was at its height.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of arresting that process and checking the speculation\r\nin gold, I detained the comptroller of the currency and three competent\r\nclerks after the close of business on the 22d of September.  The clerks\r\nreceived commissions as bank examiners, and were instructed to go to\r\nNew York that night and to take possession of the Tenth National Bank,\r\nat the opening of business in the morning, and to give directions that\r\nthe habit of certifying checks in excess of the balances due must be\r\nsuspended.  It was my expectation that the enforcement of that rule\r\nwould, or might, end the speculation, inasmuch as the purchasers of\r\ngold would be unable to meet their obligations, and therefore it would\r\nbe out of their power to create them.  This expectation was not\r\nrealized.  Whether the certification went on at the Tenth National\r\nBak in defiance of the order, or whether other banks were so\r\nconnected with the speculation that checks were certified elsewhere,\r\nwas not known to me.\r\n\r\nI called upon the President after business on the 23d of September,\r\nand made a statement of the condition of the gold market in the city\r\nof New York, as far as it had been communicated to me during the day.\r\nI then said that a sale of gold should be made for the purpose of\r\nbreaking the market and ending the excitement.  He asked me what sum\r\nI proposed to sell.  I said:  \"Three million dollars will be sufficient\r\nto break the combination.\"\r\n\r\nHe said in reply:  \"I think you had better make it $5,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nWithout assenting to his proposition or dissenting from it, I returned\r\nto the department, and sent an order for the sale of $4,000,000 of gold\r\nthe next day.  The order was to the assistant treasurer in these\r\nwords:  \"Sell $4,000,000 gold to-morrow, and buy $4,000,000 bonds.\"\r\nThe message was not in cipher, and there was no attempt to keep it\r\nsecret.  It was duplicated and sent by each of the rival telegraph\r\nlines to New York.  Within the space of fifteen minutes after the\r\nreceipt of the despatch, the price of gold fell from 160 to 133, and\r\nin the language of one of the witnesses, \"half of Wall Street was\r\ninvolved in ruin.\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the condition of Wall Street and the Gold Exchange\r\nseemed to justify the statement of the person whose language has just\r\nbeen quoted.  As a matter of fact, however, many of the people involved\r\nrecovered from the panic, and were able to meet their obligations.\r\nSome were gainers, probably, by the proceedings of the month of\r\nSeptember, and some were losers.  As I have already said, I had no\r\npurpose to help anybody or to hurt anybody, and I interfered in Wall\r\nStreet only when the operations that were going on there involved\r\ninnocent parties who were engaged in legitimate business, and also\r\nimposed upon the Government a sacrifice in the loss of revenue.\r\n\r\nFollowing the downfall of the combination, there appeared in the\r\nnewspapers statements and imputations which reflected upon the\r\nPresident and his family as to their relations to the gold operations.\r\nAll these statements were without foundation.  Mr. Corbin's connection\r\nwas established beyond controversy, but the evidence which established\r\nhis relations to the parties engaged in the gold speculation was also\r\nconclusive as to the fact that the President had no connection with it,\r\nand that he was not in any way interested in any policy calculated to\r\nadvance the interests of the combination.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions that were entertained on the evening of the 24th and\r\non the 25th of September as to the extent of the disaster to business\r\nand to individuals engaged in gold speculation were not realized in\r\nfull.  My special correspondent in New York said in a letter dated\r\nSeptember 25:  \"Many of the houses hurt and reported failed yesterday\r\nare likely to recover.\"  Again he said:  \"The demoralization in the\r\nstreet was never equaled, and it must take several days at least\r\nbefore matters get fairly straightened.  There is a wholesome dread\r\nagainst making any obligations.  Smith, Gould and Martin are just\r\nreported as paying in full.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated September 27 at 6:30 P. M., the assistant treasurer\r\nat New York wrote me:  \"From the best evidence to be gathered in the\r\nexcitement here, it is safe to infer that the Gold Exchange Bank will\r\nsuffer losses to the extent of its capital and surplus at least, and\r\nperhaps more.\"  To the contrary of that prediction, it is to be said\r\nthat the Gold Exchange Bank was able to meet all its obligations.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Mr. Grinnell, then collector of the port of New\r\nYork, under date of September 24, after the announcement of the sale of\r\ngold had been made, I find this statement:  \"Had you not taken the\r\ncourse which you did, I believe a large proportion of our most reliable\r\nmerchants and bankers would have been obliged to suspend before three\r\no'clock to-day, as confidence was entirely gone and the panic was\r\nbecoming universal.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the break in the price of gold, there were persons who became\r\napprehensive that the rate would fall to a point which would affect\r\ntheir interests unfavorably, and I received a letter, dated after\r\nbusiness hours on the 24th, in which the writer said:  \"It is not\r\nimpossible that, in view of the largeness of the amount of gold to be\r\nsold to-morrow, there may be a combination to procure it at a low\r\nprice, and you will therefore excuse a suggestion that, as the effect\r\nof your intervention has already been realized, it might be well to\r\nprotect the Government by making it known that you will reject all\r\nunacceptable bids.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from letters received previous to and during the crisis\r\nmay lead to the conclusion that it is not safe to trust to persons\r\nengaged in large business and commercial transactions as guides for the\r\nadministration of the Government in financial matters.  Indeed, one may\r\ngo still further, and say that it is not safe to trust the guidance of\r\nthe Government in financial affairs to men whose life business it has\r\nbeen to convert information into gold.\r\n\r\nThe most unpleasant incident of the gold speculation of 1869 was the\r\nfact that General Butterfield, the assistant treasurer in the city of\r\nNew York, was so far involved as to lead the President to ask for his\r\nresignation.  That request did not arise from any evidence that General\r\nButterfield was in any way concerned in the movement or combination,\r\nwhich led to the advance in gold.  Indeed, the evidence was conclusive\r\nto the contrary.  This fact, however, did appear--that during the\r\nperiod of the excitement he had made some purchases and sales of gold\r\nand bonds.  The suspicions that existed in the city of New York as to\r\nhis connection with the gold movement were largely exaggerations of\r\nthe actual facts.  There was no evidence which impeached his official\r\nor personal integrity in business.  His resignation was requested upon\r\nthe ground that it was essential to the proper administration of the\r\noffice that the person holding the important place of assistant\r\ntreasurer in the city of New York, should not be engaged in business\r\ntransactions which might give rise to the conjecture that he had\r\nadvantages over others in consequence of his connection with the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be said the Mr. Gould, in his testimony before the\r\ncommittee, which was given at great length and with singular clearness\r\nof statement, denied expressly the existence of any combination.  In\r\nfine, he claimed, what may have been the truth, and upon the whole\r\nprobably was the truth, that it was not part of his purpose to carry\r\nthe price of gold above forty or forty-five per cent premium.  He\r\nattributed the excessive and rapid advance of the price of gold to the\r\npersons who had sold short and who, becoming alarmed, attempted to\r\ncover their sales by making purchases, and by bidding against each\r\nother carried the price from about 140 to 160.\r\n\r\nThe same statement was made by Mr. Fisk as to the cause of the\r\nexcessive rise in the price of gold.  He said:  \"It went up to sixty,\r\nfor the reason that there were in that market a hundred men short of\r\ngold.  There were banking houses which had stood for fifty years, and\r\nwho did not know but what they were ruined.  They rushed into the\r\nmarket to cover their shorts.  I think it went from forty-five to\r\nsixty without the purchase of more than $600,000 or $700,000 of gold.\r\nIt went there in consequence of the frightened bear interests.  There\r\nwas a feeling that there was no gold in the market and that the\r\nGovernment would not let any gold go out.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the gold panic, Gould and Fisk were interested in the\r\nbusiness of railway transportation from the West to the seaboard, and\r\nMr. Fisk made a statement which sets forth the theory on which he and\r\nGould professed to act.  Fisk said:  \"The whole movement was based\r\nupon a desire on our part to employ our men and work our power getting\r\nsurplus crops moved East and receiving for ourselves that portion of\r\nthe transportation properly belonging to our road.  That was the\r\nbeginning of the movement, and the further operations were based upon\r\nthe promise of what Corbin said the Government would do.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony of Jay Gould and James Fisk, Jr., as it appeared\r\nin the printed report, we are able to comprehend the characteristics\r\nof the two men.  Gould was cool and collected from beginning to end,\r\nwith no indication in his statements that the events of the 24th of\r\nSeptember had in any particular disturbed him in temper or nerve or\r\nconfidence in his ability to meet the exigencies of the situation.\r\nOn the other hand, the testimony of Fisk indicated the absence of the\r\nqualities ascribed to Gould, and during his examination he failed to\r\nmaintain even ordinary equanimity of temper.  He interfered with the\r\nproceedings, and delivered this address to the committee:  \"I must\r\nstate that I must ask you gentlemen to summon witnesses whose names I\r\nshall give you.  My men are starving.  When the newspapers told you\r\nwe were keeping away from this committee, I say to you that there is\r\nno man in this country who wants to come before you as bad as Jim Fisk,\r\nJr.  I have thirty or forty thousand wives and children to feed with\r\nthe money disbursed from our office.  We have no money to pay them, and\r\nI know what has brought them to this condition.\"\r\n\r\nAnother extract from Fisk's testimony gives a graphic view of his\r\ncondition when the crash came:  \"I went down to the neighborhood of\r\nWall Street Friday morning.  When I got back to our office you can\r\nimagine I was in no enviable state of mind, and the moment I got up\r\nstreet that afternoon I started right round to old Corbin's to rake him\r\nout.  I went into the room, and sent word that Mr. Fisk wanted to see\r\nhim in the dining-room.  I was too mad to say anything civil, and when\r\nhe came into the room, said I, 'Do you know what you have done here,\r\nyou and your people?'  He began to wring his hands, and 'Oh,' he says,\r\n'this is a horrible position.  Are you ruined?'  I said I didn't know\r\nwhether I was or not; and I asked him again if he knew what had\r\nhappened.  He had been crying, and said he had just heard; that he had\r\nbeen sure everything was all right; but that something had occurred\r\nentirely different from what he had anticipated.  Said I, 'That don't\r\namount to anything.  We know that gold ought not to be at thirty-one,\r\nand that it would not be but for such performances as you have had this\r\nlast week; you know ---- well it would not if you had not failed.'  I\r\nknew that somebody had run a saw right into us, and said I, 'This whole\r\n---- thing has turned out just as I told you it would.'  I considered\r\nthe whole party a pack of cowards; and I expected that, when we came\r\nto clear our hands, they would sock it right into us.  I said to him,\r\n'I don't know whether you have lied or not, and I don't know what ought\r\nto be done with you.'\r\n\r\n\"He was on the other side of the table, weeping and wailing, and I was\r\ngnashing my teeth.  'Now,' he says, 'you must quiet yourself.'  I told\r\nhim I didn't want to be quiet; I had no desire to ever be quiet again.\r\nHe says, 'But, my dear sir, you will lose your reason.'  Says I,\r\n'Speyers has already lost his reason; reason has gone out of everybody\r\nbut me.'\"\r\n\r\nMy part and my interest in the events of Black Friday came to an end\r\nwith an effort to ascertain the authorship of an anonymous\r\ncommunication, written in red ink, that I received the 6th day of\r\nOctober.  It was postmarked at New York, the 5th of October, 1869.\r\n(A reduced facsimile of the communication is shown below.)  An attempt\r\nwas made through the police and the secret service system to trace the\r\nauthorship of the superscription.  The attempt was ineffectual.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\nIf gold does not sell at 150 within 15 days I am a ruined man.  You\r\nwill be the cause of my ruin!  Your life will be in danger.\r\n  Wilkes Booth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears in the review that Mr. Gould originated the scheme of\r\nadvancing the price of gold and that Mr. Fisk was his principal\r\ncoadjutor.  It also appears that Mr. Fisk entered into the arrangement\r\nupon the basis of friendship for Mr. Gould, and not in consequence of\r\nan opinion on his part that the scheme was a wise one.  Mr. Gould had\r\ntwo main purposes in view:  first, the profit that he might realize\r\nfrom an advance in gold; and, second, the advantage that might accrue\r\nto the railroad with which he was connected through an increase of its\r\nbusiness in the transportation of products from the West.  As set forth\r\nin Mr. Gould's letter, he entertained the opinion, which rested upon\r\nsatisfactory business grounds, that an advance in the price of gold\r\nwould stimulate the sale of Western products, increase the business\r\nof transportation over the railways, and aid us in the payment of\r\nliabilities abroad.  If the price of gold had not been advanced beyond\r\na premium of forty or perhaps forty-five per cent, all these results\r\nmight have been realized, without detriment to the public, while Mr.\r\nGould and his associates would have realized large profits.  When the\r\nprice had advanced to forty or forty-five per cent, Mr. Gould or his\r\nassociates made calls upon those who were under contracts to deliver\r\ngold to make their margins good or else to produce the gold.  These\r\ndemands created a panic, and the parties who had agreed to deliver gold\r\nentered the market, and bidding against each other, they carried the\r\nprice beyond the point that Mr. Gould had contemplated.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\nAN HISTORIC SALE OF UNITED STATES BONDS IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIf there should be any considerable interest in the history of the\r\nfunding system of the United States, the interest would be due to a\r\nsale of bonds some thirty years ago and certain incidents which could\r\nnot have been anticipated, which arose from the execution of the trust.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1868, a bill for funding the national debt which\r\nhad passed the Senate of the United States was reported, without\r\namendments, to the House of Representatives by the Committee on Ways\r\nand Means.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was under consideration in the House, I proposed a\r\nsubstitute.  In the debate of July 21 I made a statement of the nature\r\nof my substitute, and I reproduce an extract which sets forth the\r\nfirst step in a policy which culminated in the Act for Funding the\r\nPublic Debt, and which was approved by President Grant July 14, 1870:\r\n\r\n\"The amendment to which I wish to call the attention of the House\r\nprovides for the funding of $1,200,000,000 of the public debt\r\n$400,000,000 payable in fifteen years @ 5 per cent interest,\r\n$400,000,000 payable in twenty years @ 4˝ per cent interest, and\r\n$400,000,000 payable in twenty-five years @ 3.65 per cent interest,\r\nthe latter sum of $400,000,000 payable, principal and interest, at the\r\noption of the takers, either in the United States, or in London, Paris,\r\nor Frankfort.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time I had not entertained the thought that I might come to be\r\nthe head of the Treasury Department.  Indeed, I had no other purpose in\r\npublic life than to remain in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI had had experience on the executive side of the Government and also\r\non the legislative side, and I had a fixed opinion in favor of the\r\nlatter form of service.\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of the Treasury, I proposed a bill in 1869 in the line of\r\nthe substitute for the bill of the Committee on Ways and Means which I\r\nhad challenged in July, 1868.  The bill proposed an issue of three\r\nclasses of bonds, each of four hundred million dollars, which were to\r\nmature at different dates, and to bear interest at the rates of 5, 4˝,\r\nand 4 per cent.  It was further provided that the principal and\r\ninterest of the bonds bearing the lowest rate should be made payable\r\neither in the United States, or at Frankfort, Paris, or London, as the\r\ntakers might prefer.  The provision was rejected through the influence\r\nof General Schenck, who had then returned recently from Europe, and\r\nwith the opinion that the concession involved an impairment of national\r\nhonor.  As a substitute for the feature so rejected, I originated a\r\nplan for the issue of registered bonds, upon the condition that the\r\ninterest could be paid in checks to be forwarded by the mails to the\r\nholders of bonds at the places designated by them in any part of the\r\nworld.

C.\r\n_January_ 25, 1900.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,\r\n  Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Mr. Secretary:_  It gives me pleasure to enclose to you a\r\ntable showing by classes of bonds the percentage of interest paid by\r\nchecks.  The interest on all registered bonds is now so paid.  Only\r\nthe coupon bonds, by their nature, are differently treated.\r\n\r\nYour plan has worked admirably, and the drift is slowly from the coupon\r\nto the registered form, and so to an increase of the payment of\r\ninterest by checks.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards, Yours very truly,\r\n(Signed)  ELLIS H. ROBERTS,\r\n  _Treasurer of the United States._\r\n\r\nThe plan has been adopted by corporations that are borrowers of large\r\nsums of money upon an issue of bonds, and the use of the system is\r\nvery general in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn my report to Congress in December, 1869, I made recommendation of\r\nthe Funding Bill, and I placed copies of the bill that I had prepared\r\nin the hands of the Finance Committee of the Senate, and in the hands\r\nof the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill became a law, the authorized issue of five per cent\r\nbonds was limited to two hundred million dollars, and the issue of four\r\nper cent was raised to twelve hundred million.  Simultaneously with the\r\npassage of the Funding Bill of July, 1870, the war between France and\r\nPrussia opened, and the opportunity for negotiations was postponed\r\nuntil the early months of the year 1871.  In these later years, when\r\nbonds of the United States have been sold upon the basis of their par\r\nvalue at two per cent income, it is difficult to realize that in 1869\r\nthe six per cent bonds of the United States were worth in gold only\r\n83-5/10 cents to the dollar.  The first attempt to dispose of the five\r\nper cent bonds was made by the Treasury Department through an\r\ninvitation to the public to subscribe for the bonds, payment to be\r\nmade in the currency of the country, or by an exchange of outstanding\r\nfive-twenty bonds which bore interest at the rate of six per cent.\r\nThe subscriptions reached the sum of sixty-six million dollars, of\r\nwhich the national banks were subscribers to the amount of sixty-four\r\nmillion, leaving two million only as the loan to the general public.\r\nA portion of the amount taken by the banks was for the account of\r\npatrons and clients.  This experience justified the opinion that future\r\nefforts with the general public would be unsuccessful, while the credit\r\nof the country was not established and placed beyond the influence of\r\ncavilers and doubters.\r\n\r\nIt was under such circumstances that the aid of banks and bankers\r\nbecame important for the furtherance of subscriptions, in view of the\r\nfact that they could give personal service of a nature not possible in\r\nthe case of salaried officers of the Government, nor compatible with\r\ntheir daily duties.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, in this age of comparative freedom and power in\r\nfinancial affairs, to comprehend that in the year 1871 the long\r\nestablished bankers of New York, Amsterdam, and London, either declined\r\nor neglected the opportunity to negotiate the five per cent coin bonds\r\nof the United States upon the basis of their par value.  It may not be\r\nout of place for me to mention Mr. Morton, of the house of Morton,\r\nBliss & Co., as an exception, to the bankers of Europe and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same months of 1871 that I recommended the issue of a\r\nfour per cent fifty-year bond as the basis of the currency to be issued\r\nby the national banks.  This proposition, which would have been\r\nadvantageous to the banks, in an increasing ratio as the value of money\r\ndiminished, was defeated by the organized opposition of the banks\r\nthrough an effective lobby that was assembled in the city of\r\nWashington.  Such was the public sentiment in the year 1871, even in\r\nthe presence of these important facts, that in the month of December\r\nI was able to say in my annual report that the debt had been diminished\r\nduring the next preceding year in the sum of ninety-four million\r\ndollars, and that the total decrease from March 1, 1869 to December 1,\r\n1871, was over two hundred and seventy-seven million dollars.\r\n\r\nIt was in this situation of affairs that Messrs. Jay Cooke & Co.\r\nproposed to undertake the sale in London, by subscription, of one\r\nhundred and thirty-four million five per cent bonds then unsold.\r\nAuthority was given to Cooke & Co. to proceed with the undertaking,\r\nand when the books were closed, September 1, I was informed that the\r\nloan had been taken in full.  By the terms prescribed by Cooke & Co.,\r\nthe subscribers deposited five per cent as security for the validity\r\nof their subscriptions.  The bonds were to be delivered the first day\r\nof December.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the information that the undertaking had been a\r\nsuccess, the bonds were prepared, and the Hon. William A. Richardson,\r\nthen an assistant secretary of the Treasury, was designated as the\r\nagent of the department for the delivery of the bonds.  The bonds were\r\nplaced in safes, on each of which there were three locks.  The clerks\r\nwere sent over in different vessels, and the keys were so distributed\r\namong them, that there were not keys in any one vessel by which any\r\none of the safes could be opened.\r\n\r\nThe success of the subscription gave rise to an unexpected difficulty.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were outstanding one hundred and ninety-four million\r\nten-forty United States bonds that carried interest at the rate of\r\nfive per cent.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular coincidence, and a coincidence probably not due to\r\nnatural causes, that some five per cent bonds, having fifteen years to\r\nrun, should be at par, and that other five per cent bonds that might\r\nrun thirty years should fall below par in the same market.  In the\r\nthree months from August to December, these ten-forties were quoted\r\nas low as ninety-seven, or even for a time at ninety-six.  Cooke became\r\nanxious, if not alarmed, lest the rate should fall below ninety-five,\r\nand consequently lest the subscribers should refuse to meet their\r\nobligations.  Early on the morning of the first Monday in December, I\r\nreceived the information that the bonds were taken as soon as the\r\noffices were open.  I may mention in passing that Cooke & Co. paid for\r\nthe bonds as they were delivered, either in coin or in five-twenty\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nAs bonds were taken, and as payments were made, a difficulty appeared\r\nwhich had been anticipated, but not in its fullness.  The proceeds from\r\nthe sales of the five per cent bonds were pledged to the redemption of\r\nthe six per cent five-twenty bonds, reckoned at their par value.\r\n\r\nIt was provided by the statute that whenever five-twenty bonds were\r\ncalled, a notice of ninety days should be given, when interest would\r\ncease.  Thus it happened that whenever a bond was called it was worth\r\npar and interest to the end of the ninety days.  Of the called bonds\r\nsome were in America, and the owners did not choose to present them in\r\nLondon in exchange for five per cent bonds, nor for coin.  Hence it\r\nhappened that the total proceeds of the five per cent bonds, about\r\ntwenty million dollars were paid in gold coin by Cooke & Co.  This\r\ncoin was deposited in the Bank of England, but upon such terms as\r\nwere imposed by the governors:\r\n\r\n(1)  The deposits must be made in the name of William A. Richardson.\r\nThis was done, but a statement was made by Judge Richardson that the\r\ndeposit was the property of the United States.\r\n\r\n(2)  The gold was not to be taken out of the country.  This stipulation\r\nwas in the line of our policy, which was to invest the entire sum in\r\nfive-twenty bonds, whenever they could be bought at par.  The\r\nopportunity came in a manner that was not anticipated.  The documents\r\nreferred to are of historical value, and they are therefore inserted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_(a)_  A declaration of trust by William A.

GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury._\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_ It is my purpose in this letter to give you an account of\r\nthe way in which I have kept the money arising from the sale of the\r\nFunded Loan, and the manner in which it has been drawn from time to\r\ntime to pay for bonds purchased and redeemed.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the first of December, 1871, the money began to\r\naccumulate very rapidly.  Up to the first of December no money whatever\r\nhad been received, all bonds delivered having been paid for by the\r\ncalled bonds and coupons or secured by deposit of other bonds; but on\r\nthe second day of that month nearly two and a half millions of dollars\r\ncash were paid to me; then on the fourth, nearly five millions of\r\ndollars more; and on the fifth, above three millions, and so on in\r\ndifferent sums till the present time.\r\n\r\nOf course it was wholly impracticable to receive, handle, count and\r\nkeep on hand such large amounts of gold coin, weighing between a ton\r\nand three quarters and two tons to each million of dollars.  At one\r\ntime my account showed more than sixteen millions of dollars on hand,\r\nand to have withdrawn from circulation that amount of coin would have\r\nproduced a panic in the London market; and the risk in having it\r\nhoarded in any place within my reach would have been immense,\r\nespecially as it would have soon been known where it was.\r\n\r\nI ascertained that there would be some difficulty in keeping an\r\nofficial Government account in the Bank of England, and I did not feel\r\nauthorized, or justified in my own judgment, in entrusting so much\r\nmoney to any other banking institution in this city.  I found, also,\r\nthat the Bank of England never issues certificates of deposit, as do\r\nour banks in the United States.  But it issues \"post notes,\" which are\r\nvery nearly like its ordinary demand notes, but _payable to order,_ and\r\non seven days' time, thus differing only in the matter of time from\r\ncertificates of deposit.  Availing myself of this custom of the Bank\r\nof England, I put all the money into post notes, and locked them up in\r\none of the safes from which the bonds had been taken.  This I regarded\r\nas a safe method of keeping the funds, and I anticipated no further\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nBut when the Bank made its next monthly or weekly return of its\r\ncondition, and published it in all of the newspapers as usual, the\r\nattention of all the financial agents, bankers, and financial writers\r\nof the daily money articles in the journals was immediately attracted\r\nto the sudden increase of the \"post notes\" outstanding, and the\r\nunusually large amount of them, so many times greater than had ever\r\nbeen known before.  They were immensely alarmed lest the notes should\r\ncome in for redemption in a few days, and the coin therefor should be\r\nwithdrawn from London and taken to a foreign country; and lest there\r\nshould be a panic on account thereof.  Some of the financial writers\r\nsaid they belonged to Germany, and that they represented coin which\r\nmust soon be transmitted to Berlin.  The Bank officers themselves,\r\nalthough they knew very well that these notes belonged to the United\r\nStates, were not less alarmed because they feared that I would\r\nwithdraw the money to send it to New York, which they knew would make\r\ntrouble in the London Exchange.  Money, which for a short time before\r\nhad been at the high rate of interest, for this place, of five per\r\ncent, had become abundant, and the people were demanding of the Bank\r\na reduction in the rate; but so timid were they about these post\r\nnotes that they did not change the rate until I took measures to\r\nallay their fears.  This I did because I thought it would be injurious\r\nand prejudicial to the Funded Loan to have a panic in London, in which\r\nthe market price of the new loan would drop considerably below par\r\njust at a time when its price and popularity were gradually rising,\r\nand just as it was coming into great favor with a new class of\r\ninvestors in England, the immensely rich but timid conservatives.\r\n\r\nI determined to open a deposit account with the Bank of England, and in\r\ndoing so experienced the difficulties which I anticipated.  I assured\r\nthe officers that the money was Government (U. S.) money, which I did\r\nnot intend, and was not instructed to take home with me; but which I\r\nshould use in London in redeeming bonds and coupons, and should leave\r\nin the bank on deposit unless by the peculiarity of their rules, I\r\nshould be obliged to withdraw it.  They objected to taking the money\r\nas a Government deposit, or as an official deposit in my name, having\r\nsome vague idea that if they took it and opened an official Government\r\naccount they should be liable for the appropriation of the money unless\r\ndocuments from the United States were filed with them taking away\r\nthat liability, but they could not tell me exactly what documents\r\nthey wanted nor from whom they must come.  They did, however, agree to\r\nopen an account with me, and that was the best I could do.  In signing\r\nmy name to their book, I added my official title, and when, some time\r\nafter, I came to drawing checks, I signed in the same way.  This\r\nbrought from the officers a letter which I annex hereto, saying that\r\nmy deposit would be regarded as a private and personal one.\r\n\r\nWhat I was most anxious to provide for was the power in some United\r\nStates officer to draw the money in case of my death (knowing the\r\nuncertainty of life), without the delay, expense, and trouble which\r\nmust necessarily arise, if it stood wholly to my personal credit.  I\r\nasked the officers to allow it to stand in your name as Secretary and\r\nmine as Assistant Secretary, jointly and severally, so as to be drawn\r\nupon the several check of either, and by the survivor in case of the\r\ndeath of either one.  I suggested other arrangements which would have\r\nhad the same result, but they said their rules prevented their\r\nagreeing to my requests, that they were conservative and did not like\r\nto introduce anything new into their customs.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of January, 1872, I renewed my request in writing,\r\nafter having had several conversations with the officers on the\r\nsubject, and received an answer which, with the letter of request, is\r\nhereto annexed.\r\n\r\nIn this, their most recent communication, they express a willingness\r\nto enter the account in our joint names as I suggested, regarding it,\r\nhowever, as a \"personal account\" and requiring that you should \"join\r\nin the request and concur in the conditions proposed before either\r\nparty can in that case draw upon the account.\"\r\n\r\nAs I must now almost daily draw from the account for money with which\r\nto pay bonds, I cannot join your name therein until you have sent me\r\na written compliance with the conditions which they set forth, because\r\nto do so would shut me out from the account altogether for several\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nBesides, having no instruction from you on the subject, I don't know\r\nthat you would care to give written directions as to the deposit.  I\r\nknow very well that, in case of my sudden decease, you would be glad\r\nenough to find that you could at once avail yourself of the whole\r\namount of money here on deposit, and so I should have joined your name\r\nas I have stated.  Now you can do as you please.  I have taken every\r\npossible precaution within my power, and have no fear that the\r\narrangements are insufficient to protect the Government in any\r\ncontingency whatever.  With the correspondence which has passed between\r\nthe officers of the Bank and myself, and our conversation together, the\r\naccount is sufficiently well known to them as a U. S. Government\r\ndeposit, and is fully enough stamped with that character, as I intended\r\nit should be, however much they may ignore it now.\r\n\r\nBut for still greater caution, I made the written declaration of trust\r\non the very day of the first deposit, signed and sealed by me,\r\ndeclaring the money and account as belonging to our Government, and not\r\nto me, a copy of which is hereto annexed.\r\n\r\nI also gave written instruction to Messrs. Bigelow and Prentiss to\r\ndraw all the checks, and how to draw them and keep an account thereof.\r\nAs I make all my purchases through Jay Cooke, McCullough & Co., every\r\ncheck is in fact payable to that house, so that the account is easily\r\nkept, and the transactions cannot be mingled with others, for there\r\nare no others.  I annex a copy of these instructions.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, will give you a pretty correct idea of the\r\ndifficulties which have been presented to me in the matter of taking,\r\nkeeping, and paying out the money arising from the sale of the bonds,\r\nand the manner in which I have met them.\r\n\r\nI may add that when the officers of the Bank were satisfied that I was\r\nnot to withdraw the money and take it to New York, they reduced the\r\nrate of interest and there has been an easy market ever since.\r\n\r\nThere are now on deposit more than twelve million dollars; but I hope\r\nit will be reduced very fast next month.  Had you not sent over the\r\nlast ten million of bonds, we should have been able to close up very\r\nsoon.  I hope now that you will make another call of twenty million at\r\nleast, because I think it would enable us to purchase more rapidly.\r\n\r\nI annex:\r\n(1)  Copy of declaration of trust.\r\n(2)  Copy of instructions for drawing checks.\r\n(3)  Copy of letter from Cashier of Bank of England, stating that the\r\naccount would be considered personal.\r\n(4)  Copy of my letter to the Governor of the Bank, asking that your\r\nname might be joined.\r\n(5)  Copy of reply to last mentioned letter.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully,\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n(Signed)  WILLIAM A. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cooke & Co. had completed their undertaking, the deposits in the\r\nBank of England exceeded fifteen million dollars, and for three months\r\nthey were for the most part unavailable, as the five-twenty bonds which\r\nhad not matured under the calls that had been made were above par in\r\nthe market.  It was a condition of the loan that the five-twenty bonds\r\nredeemed should equal the 5 per cent bonds that had been issued, both\r\nissued to be reckoned at their par value.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1872, the Commissioners who had been designated\r\nunder the Treaty of Washington of 1871 to ascertain and determine the\r\ncharacter and magnitude of the claims that had been preferred by the\r\nUnited States against Great Britain, growing out of the depredations\r\ncommitted by the \"Alabama\" and her associate cruisers, were about to\r\nmeet at Geneva for the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nThe administration had appointed the Hon. J. C. Bancroft Davis, the\r\nmost accomplished diplomatist of the country, as the agent of the\r\nUnited States, and the preparation of \"the Case of the United States\"\r\nwas placed in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe British Ministry discovered--or they fancied that there was\r\nconcealed in covert language--a claim for damages, known as\r\n\"consequential or indirect damages\"--in other words, a claim to\r\ncompensation for the value of American shipping that had been driven\r\nfrom the ocean and made worthless through fear of the cruisers that had\r\nbeen fitted out in British ports.\r\n\r\nThis claim, in the extreme form in which it had been presented by Mr.\r\nSumner, had been relinquished by the Administration, and a present\r\nreading of \"the Case of the United States\" may not justify the\r\nconstruction that was put upon it by the British Ministry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Administration received notice that Great Britain\r\nwould not be represented at the Geneva Conference.\r\n\r\nThe subject was considered by the President and Cabinet on three\r\nconsecutive days at called sessions.  At the final meeting I handed\r\na memorandum to the President, which he passed to the Secretary of\r\nState.  The memorandum was not read to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, the Commissioner for the United States, had not then left\r\nthe country.  By a despatch from the Secretary of State Mr. Adams\r\nwas asked to meet me at the Parker House in Boston, on the second day\r\nafter the day of the date of the despatch.\r\n\r\nWhat occurred at the meeting may be best given through an extract from\r\nthe diary of Mr. Adams, which has been placed in my hands by Mr.\r\nCharles Francis Adams, Jr., with the privilege of its full and free\r\nuse by me.\r\n\r\nThe first entry is under date of Saturday, April 20, 1872, and is in\r\nthese words:  \"Charles brought me a telegram from Governor Fish,\r\ndesiring me to meet Mr. Boutwell, who will be at the Parker House\r\nat eleven o'clock on Monday.\"  The second entry is under date of\r\n\"Monday, 22d of April.\"\r\n\r\n\"At eleven o'clock called on Mr. Boutwell, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, at Parker's Hotel, according to agreement.  Found him\r\nalone in his minute bedroom.  He soon opened his subject--handed over\r\nto me a packet from Governor Fish, and said that it was the desire of\r\nthe Government, it I could find it consistent with what they\r\nunderstood to be my views of the question of indirect damages, that I\r\nwould make such intimation of them to persons of authority in London\r\nas might relieve them of the difficulty which had been occasioned by\r\nthem.  I told them of my conversation held with the Marquis of Ripon,\r\nin which I had assumed the heavy responsibility of assuring him that\r\nthe Government would not press them.  I was glad now to find that I\r\nhad not been mistaken.  I should cheerfully do all in my power to\r\nconfirm the impressions consistently with my own position.\"\r\n\r\nThus, through Mr. Adams, the claim for \"indirect damages\" was\r\nrelinquished.  When the fact of the disturbed relations between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain became public there was a panic in\r\nthe London stock market, and in the brief period of eight and forty\r\nhours our deposit of twelve million or more in the Bank of England was\r\nconverted into five-twenty United States 6 per cent bonds, purchased\r\nat par.\r\n\r\nIn my annual report for December, 1872, I was able to make this statement:\r\n\r\n\"Since my last annual report the business of negotiating two hundred\r\nmillion of 5 per cent bonds, and the redemption of two hundred million\r\n6 per cent five-twenty bonds has been completed and the accounts have\r\nbeen settled by the accounting officers of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Further negotiations of 5 per cent bonds can now be made on the basis\r\nof the former negotiation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\nGENERAL GRANT'S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe greatness of General Grant in war, in civil affairs, and in\r\npersonal qualities which at once excite our admiration and deserve our\r\ncommendation, was not fully appreciated by the generation to which he\r\nbelonged, nor can it be appreciated by the generations that can know\r\nof him only as his life and character may appear upon the written\r\nrecord.  He had weaknesses, and of some of them I may speak; but they\r\ndo not qualify in any essential manner his claim to greatness in the\r\nparticulars named.  He was not fortunate in the circumstances incident\r\nto the appointment of his Cabinet.  The appointment of Mr. Washburne\r\nas Secretary of State for the brief period of one or two weeks was not\r\na wise opening of the administration, if the arrangement was designed,\r\nand was a misfortune, if the brief term was due to events not\r\nanticipated.  The selection of Mr. Fish compensated, and more than\r\ncompensated, for the errors which preceded his appointment.  The\r\ncountry can never expect an administration of the affairs of the\r\nDepartment of State more worthy of approval and eulogy than the\r\nadministration of Mr. Fish.  Apparently we were then on the verge of\r\nwar with Great Britain, and demands were made in very responsible\r\nquarters which offered no alternative but war.  The treaty of 1871,\r\nwhich was the outcome of Mr. Fish's diplomacy, re-established our\r\nrelations of friendship with Great Britain, and the treaty was then\r\naccepted as a step in the direction of general peace.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, 1869, I received an invitation from General\r\nGrant to call upon him on an evening named and at an hour specified.\r\nAt the interview General Grant asked me to take the office of Secretary\r\nof the Interior.  As reasons for declining the place, I said that my\r\nduties and position in the House were agreeable to me and that my\r\nservices there might be as valuable to the Administration as my\r\nservices in the Cabinet.  General Grant then said that he intended to\r\ngive a place to Massachusetts, and it might be the Secretary of the\r\nInterior or the Attorney-Generalship.  He then asked for my advice as\r\nto persons, and said that if he named an Attorney-General from\r\nMassachusetts, he had in mind Governor Clifford, whom he had met.\r\nGovernor Clifford was my personal friend, he had been the Attorney-\r\nGeneral of the State during my term as Governor, he was a gentleman of\r\ngreat urbanity of manner, a well-equipped lawyer, and as an advocate he\r\nhad secured and maintained a good standing in the profession and through\r\nmany years.  He had come into the Republican Party from the Webster\r\nwing of the Whig Party.  To me he was a conservative, and I was\r\napprehensive that his views upon questions arising, or that might\r\narise, from our plan of reconstruction might not be in harmony with the\r\npolicy of the party.  Upon this ground, which I stated to General\r\nGrant, I advised against his appointment.  I named Judge Hoar for\r\nAttorney-General and Governor Claflin for the Interior Department.  I\r\nwrote the full address of Judge Hoar upon a card, which I gave to\r\nGeneral Grant.  Judge Hoar was nominated and confirmed.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Alexander T. Stewart, of New York, was nominated\r\nand confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury.  It was soon discovered\r\nthat Mr. Stewart, being an importer, was ineligible for the office.\r\nMr. Conkling said there were nine statutes in his way.  A more\r\neffectual bar was in the reason on which the statutes rested, namely,\r\nthat no man should be put in a situation to be a judge in his own\r\ncause.  The President made a vain effort to secure legislation for the\r\nremoval of the bar.  Next, Judge Hilton, then Mr. Stewart's attorney,\r\nsubmitted a deed of trust by which Mr. Stewart relinquished his\r\ninterest in the business during his term of office.  The President\r\nsubmitted that paper to Chief Justice Cartter of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe District of Columbia.  The Chief Justice gave a brief, adverse,\r\noral opinion, and in language not quotable upon a printed page.\r\n\r\nWe have no means of forming an opinion of Mr. Stewart's capacity for\r\nadministrative work, and I do not indulge in any conjectures.  His\r\nnomination was acceptable to the leading business interests of the\r\ncountry, and in the city of New York it was supported generally.  He\r\nwas a successful man of business and an accumulator of wealth, and at\r\nthat time General Grant placed a high estimate upon the presence of\r\ntalents by which men acquire wealth.\r\n\r\nFollowing these events, there were early indications that Mr. Stewart's\r\ninterest in the President had been diminished, and gradually he took\r\non a dislike to me.  When I knew of his nomination, or when I knew it\r\nwas to be made, I met him in Washington and assured him of my\r\ndisposition to give my support to his administration.  On two occasions\r\nwhen I was in New York I made calls of civility upon him, but, as he\r\nmade no recognition in return, my efforts in that direction came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner given by merchants and bankers in the early part of\r\nSeptember, 1869, at which I was a guest, Mr. Stewart made a speech in\r\nwhich he criticized my administration of the Treasury.  In the canvass\r\nof 1872 the rumor went abroad that Mr. Stewart had given $25,000 to\r\nthe Greeley campaign fund.  In the month of October of that year, the\r\ntwenty-eighth day, perhaps, I spoke at the Cooper Union.  Upon my\r\narrival in New York, I received a call from a friend who came with a\r\nmessage from Mr. Stewart.  Mr. Stewart would not be at the meeting,\r\nalthough except for the false rumor in regard to his subscription to\r\nthe Greeley fund, he should have taken pleasure in being present.  As\r\nGeneral Grant was to be elected, his attendance at the meeting might\r\nbe treated by the public as an attempt to curry favor with General\r\nGrant and the incoming Administration.\r\n\r\nAs I was passing to the hall, a paper was placed into my hands by a\r\nperson who gave no other means of recognizing his presence.  When I\r\nreached the hall and opened the paper, I found that it was a summons\r\nto appear as a defendant in an action brought by a man named Galvin,\r\nwho claimed damages in the sum of $3,000,000.  At the close of the\r\nmeeting and when the fact became known one gentleman said to me:  \"I\r\ndo not see how you could have spoken after such a summons.\"\r\n\r\nI said in reply:  \"If the suit had been for $3,000 only, it might have\r\ngiven me some uneasiness, as a recovery would have involved payment.\r\nA judgment of $3,000,000 implies impossibility of payment.\"\r\n\r\nI had no knowledge of Galvin, but his letters of advice were found on\r\nthe files of the Treasury.  Even after the suit, I did not examine them\r\nfor the purpose of forming an opinion of their value or want of value.\r\nGalvin alleged in his declaration that he had furnished the financial\r\npolicy that I had adopted, that it had benefitted the country to the\r\namount of $300,000,000 and more, and that a claim of $3,000,000 was a\r\nmoderate claim.  Under the statute, the Department of Justice assumed\r\nthe defence.  The case lingered, Galvin died, and the case followed.\r\n\r\nAt the election of 1872, I voted at Groton in the morning, and in the\r\nafternoon I went to New York, to find that General Grant had been\r\nre-elected by a sufficient majority.  On the morning of the next day, I\r\nleft the hotel with time for a call upon General Dix, who had been\r\nelected Governor, and for a call upon Thurlow Weed.  General Dix was\r\nnot at home.  Notwithstanding the criticisms of Thurlow Weed as a\r\nmanager of political affairs in the State of New York and in the\r\ncountry, I had reasons for regarding him with favor, although I had\r\nnever favored the aspirations of Mr. Seward, his chief.  When I was\r\norganizing the Internal Revenue Office in 1862-1863, Mr. Weed gave me\r\ninformation in regard to candidates for office in the State of New\r\nYork, including their relations to the factions that existed--usually\r\nSeward and anti-Seward--and with as much fairness as he could have\r\ncommanded if he had had no relation to either faction.\r\n\r\nAs I had time remaining at the end of my call upon Mr. Weed, and as I\r\nhad in mind Mr. Stewart's message at the Cooper Union meeting, I drove\r\nto his down-town store, where I found him.  He received me with\r\ncordiality, but in respect to his health he seemed to be already a\r\ndoomed man.  He was anxious chiefly to give me an opportunity to\r\ncomprehend the nature and magnitude of his business.  As I was about\r\nto leave, he took hold of my coat button and said:  \"When you see the\r\nPresident, you give my love to him, and say to him that I am for him\r\nand that I always have been for him.\"  Still holding me by the button,\r\nhe said:  \"Who buys the carpets for the Treasury?\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"Mr. Saville is the chief clerk, and he buys the carpets.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart said:  \"Tell him to come to me; I will sell him carpets\r\nas cheap as anybody.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I repeated Mr. Stewart's message to the President he made no\r\nreply, and he gave no indication that he was hearing what I was saying.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Judge Hoar's relations to President Grant, the public has\r\nbeen invited to accept several errors, the appointment to the bench of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Justices Bradley and Strong, by whose votes the\r\nfirst decision of the court in the Legal Tender cases was overruled,\r\nand the circumstances which led to the retirement of Judge Hoar from\r\nthe Cabinet.  First of all I may say that President Grant was attached\r\nto Judge Hoar, and, as far as I know, his attachment never underwent\r\nany abatement.  Whatever bond there may be in the smoking habit, it\r\nwas formed without delay at the beginning of their acquaintance.  While\r\nGeneral Grant was not a teller of stories, he enjoyed listening to good\r\nones, and of these Judge Hoar had a large stock always at command.\r\nGeneral Grant enjoyed the society of intellectual men, and Judge Hoar\r\nwas far up in that class.  General Grant had regrets for the retirement\r\nof Judge Hoar from his Cabinet, and for the circumstances which led to\r\nhis retirement.  His appointment of Judge Hoar upon the Joint High\r\nCommission and the nomination of Judge Hoar to a seat upon the bench of\r\nthe Supreme Court may be accepted as evidence of General Grant's\r\ncontinuing friendship, and of his disposition to recognize it,\r\nnotwithstanding the break in official relations.\r\n\r\nJudge Hoar's professional life had been passed in Massachusetts, and\r\nhe had no personal acquaintance with the lawyers of the circuit from\r\nwhich Justices Strong and Bradley were appointed.  Strong and Bradley\r\nwere at the head of the profession in the States of New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, and in truth there was no debate as to the fitness of\r\ntheir appointment.  Judge Hoar was not responsible for their\r\nappointment, and I am of the opinion that the nomination would have\r\nbeen made even against his advice, which assuredly was not so given.\r\nJudge Strong, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,\r\nhad sustained the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Act, and it\r\nwas understood that Bradley was of the same opinion.  As the President\r\nand Cabinet were of a like opinion, it may be said that there could\r\nhave been no \"packing\" of the Supreme Court except by the exclusion\r\nof the two most prominent lawyers in the circuit and the appointment\r\nof men whose opinions upon a vital question were not in harmony with\r\nthe opinion of the person making the appointment.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I had never accepted the original decision as sound law\r\nunder the Constitution, nor as a wise public policy, if there had\r\nbeen no Constitution.  By the decision the Government was shorn of a\r\npart of its financial means of defence in an exigency.  When the\r\nSupreme Court had reached a conclusion, Chief Justice Chase called\r\nupon me and informed me of that fact, about two weeks in advance of\r\nthe delivery of the opinion.  He gave as a reason his apprehension of\r\nserious financial difficulties due to a demand for gold by the\r\ncreditor class.  Not sharing in that apprehension, I said:  \"The\r\nbusiness men are all debtors as well as creditors, and they cannot\r\nengage in a struggle over gold payments, and the small class of\r\ncreditors who are not also debtors will not venture upon a policy in\r\nwhich they must suffer ultimately.\"  The decision did not cause a\r\nripple in the finances of the country.\r\n\r\nPursuing the conversation, I asked the Chief Justice where he found\r\nauthority in the Constitution for the issue of non-legal-tender\r\ncurrency.  He answered in the power to borrow money and in the power\r\ngiven to Congress to provide for the \"general welfare of the United\r\nStates.\"  I then said, having in mind the opinion in the case of\r\nMacCulloch and Maryland, in which the court held that where a power\r\nwas given to Congress, its exercise was a matter of discretion unless\r\na limitation could be found in the Constitution:  \"Where do you find\r\na limitation to the power to borrow money by any means that to Congress\r\nmay appear wise?\"  The Chief Justice was unable to specify a\r\nlimitation, and the question remains unanswered to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the case of Hepburn and Griswold was overruled in the Legal Tender\r\ncases, the Chief Justice was very much disturbed, and with the\r\nexhibition of considerable feeling, he said:  \"Why did you consent to\r\nthe appointment of judges to overrule me?\"  I assured him that there\r\nwas no personal feeling on the part of the President, and that as to\r\nmy own unimportant part in the business, he had known from the time of\r\nour interview in regard to the former action of the court that I\r\nentertained the opinion that the decision operated as a limitation of\r\nthe constitutional powers of Congress and that its full and final\r\nrecognition might prove injurious to the country whenever all its\r\nresources should be required.  At the time of the reversal, the Chief\r\nJustice did not conceal his dissatisfaction with his life and labors\r\non the bench, and at the interview last mentioned he said that he\r\nshould be glad to exchange positions with me, if it were possible to\r\nmake the exchange.\r\n\r\nVarious reasons have been assigned for the step which was taken by\r\nPresident Grant in asking Judge Hoar to retire from the Cabinet.  Some\r\nhave assumed that the President was no longer willing to tolerate the\r\npresence of two members from the same State.  That consideration had\r\nbeen passed upon by the President at the outset, and he had overruled\r\nit or set it aside.  In my interview with Mr. Washburne the Sunday\r\nbefore my nomination, I had said to him that Judge Hoar and I were not\r\nonly from the same State, but that we were residents of the same\r\ncounty, and within twenty miles of each other.  Moreover, any public\r\ndissatisfaction which had existed at the beginning had disappeared.\r\nIn the meantime the President had become attached to Judge Hoar.  Nor\r\nis there any justifying foundation for the conjecture that a vacancy\r\nwas created for the purpose of giving a place in the Cabinet to another\r\nperson, or to another section of the country.  General Grant's\r\nattachment to his friends was near to a weakness, and the suggestion\r\nthat he sacrificed Judge Hoar to the low purpose of giving a place to\r\nsome other person is far away from any true view of his character.\r\n\r\nJudge Hoar had had no administrative experience on the political side\r\nof the government, and he underestimated the claims, and he undervalued\r\nthe rights, of members of Congress.  As individuals the members of\r\nCongress are of the Government, and in a final test the two Houses may\r\nbecome the Government.  More than elsewhere the seat of power is in the\r\nSenate, and the Senate and Senators are careful to exact a recognition\r\nof their rights.  They claim, what from the beginning they have\r\nenjoyed, the right to be heard by the President and the heads of\r\ndepartments in their respective States.  They do not claim to speak\r\nauthoritatively, but as members of the Government having a right to\r\nadvise, and under a certain responsibility to the people for what may\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed by Senators that the Attorney-General seemed not to\r\nadmit their right to speak in regard to appointments, and that\r\nappointments were made of which they had no knowledge, and of which\r\nneither they nor their constituents could approve.  These differences\r\nreached a crisis when Senators (I use the word in the plural) notified\r\nthe President that they should not visit the Department of Justice\r\nwhile Judge Hoar was Attorney-General.  Thus was a disagreeable\r\nalternative presented to the President, and a first impression would\r\nlead to the conclusion that he ought to have sustained the Attorney-\r\nGeneral.  Assuming that the complaints were well founded, it followed\r\nthat the Attorney-General was denying to Senators the consideration\r\nwhich the President himself was recognizing daily.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant looked upon members of his Cabinet as his family for\r\nthe management of civil affairs, as he had looked upon his staff as\r\nhis military family for the conduct of the army, and he regarded a\r\nrecommendation for a Cabinet appointment as an interference.  His\r\nfirst Cabinet was organized upon that theory somewhat modified by a\r\nreference to locality.  Mr. Borie who became Secretary of the Navy\r\nwas a most excellent man, but he had had no preparation either by\r\ntraining or experience for the duties of a department.  Of this he\r\nwas quite conscious, and he never attempted to conceal the fact.  He\r\noften said:\r\n\r\n\"The department is managed by Admiral Porter, I am only a figure-head.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few months he resigned.  His associates were much attached to him.\r\nHe was a benevolent, genial, well informed man.  His successor, Mr.\r\nRobeson, was a man of singular ability, lacking only the habit of\r\ncareful, continuous industry.  This failing contributed to his\r\nmisfortunes in administration and consequently he was the subject of\r\nmany attacks in the newspapers and in Congress.  After his retirement\r\nhe became a member of the House of Representatives, and it was a\r\nnoticeable fact, that from that day the attacks in Congress ceased.\r\nAs a debater he was well equipped, and in reference to his\r\nadministration of the Navy Department, he was always prepared with an\r\nanswer or an explanation in every exigency.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Governor Fish to the Department of State, gave rise\r\nto considerable adverse comment.  The chief grounds of complaint were\r\nthat he was no longer young and that recently he had not been active\r\nin political contests.  He had been a Whig when there was a Whig Party,\r\nand he became a Republican when the Republican Party was formed.  As a\r\nWhig he had been a member of the House of Representatives and of the\r\nSenate of the United States, but he had not held office as a\r\nRepublican, nor was he known generally as a speaker or writer in\r\nsupport of the policies or principles of the party.  His age, then\r\nabout sixty, was urged as a reason against his appointment.  His\r\nselection as Secretary was extremely fortunate for General Grant and\r\nhis administration.  Governor Fish was painstaking in his office,\r\nexacting in his demands upon subordinates, without being harsh or\r\nunjust, diligent in his duties, and fully informed as to the traditions\r\nand usages of his department.  Beyond these administrative qualities\r\nhe had the capacity to place every question of a diplomatic character\r\nupon a foundation at once reasonable and legal.  If the failure of Mr.\r\nStewart led to the appointment of Governor Fish the change was\r\nfortunate for General Grant and the country.  After the failure of Mr.\r\nStewart, Mr. Washburne spoke of his appointment to the State\r\nDepartment, as only temporary, but for a few days he acted as though\r\nhe expected to remain permanently.  If his transfer to France was an\r\nafterthought, he and the President very carefully concealed that fact.\r\nIt is not probable that the President at the outset designed to take\r\nthe Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury from New York\r\nCity.  Hence I infer that the failure of Mr. Stewart worked a change\r\nin the headship of the State Department, and hence I am of the opinion\r\nthat the failure of Mr. Stewart was of great advantage to the\r\nadministration and to the country, and that without considering whether\r\nthere was a gain or loss in the Treasury Department.  There can be no\r\ndoubt that Governor Fish was a much wiser man than Mr. Washburne for\r\nthe management of foreign affairs and there can be as little doubt that\r\nMr. Washburne could not have been excelled as Minister to Paris in the\r\ntroublous period of the years 1870 and 1871.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish had no ambitions beyond the proper and successful\r\nadministration of his own department.  He did not aspire to the\r\nPresidency, and he remained in the State Department during General\r\nGrant's second term, at the special request of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's removal from the chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations was due to the fact that a time came when he did not\r\nrecognize the President, and when he declined to have any intercourse\r\nwith the Secretary of State outside of official business.  Such a\r\ncondition of affairs is always a hindrance in the way of good\r\ngovernment, and it may become an obstacle to success.  Good government\r\ncan be secured only through conferences with those who are responsible,\r\nby conciliation, and not infrequently by concessions to the holders of\r\nadverse opinions.  The time came when such a condition was no longer\r\npossible between Mr. Sumner and the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe President and his Cabinet were in accord in regard to the\r\ncontroversy with Great Britain as to the Alabama Claims.  Mr. Sumner\r\nadvocated a more exacting policy.  Mr. Motley appeared to be following\r\nMr. Sumner's lead, and the opposition to Mr. Sumner extended to Mr.\r\nMotley.  It had happened that the President had taken on a prejudice\r\nto Mr. Motley at their first interview.  This I learned when I said\r\nsomething to the President in the line of conciliation.  The President\r\nsaid:  \"Such was my impression of Motley when I saw him that I should\r\nhave withheld his appointment if I had not made a promise to Sumner.\"\r\nMy acquaintance with Mr. Motley began in the year 1849, when we were\r\nmembers of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and I had a\r\nhigh regard for him, although it had been charged that I had had some\r\npart in driving him from politics into literature.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the natures and the training of the two men, it is\r\nnot easy to imagine agreeable co-operation in public affairs by Mr.\r\nSumner and General Grant.  Mr. Sumner never believed in General Grant's\r\nfitness for the office of President, and General Grant did not\r\nrecognize in Mr. Sumner a wise and safe leader in the business of\r\ngovernment.  General Grant's notion of Mr. Sumner, on one side of his\r\ncharacter, may be inferred from his answer when, being asked if he\r\nhad heard Mr. Sumner converse, he said:  \"No, but I have heard him\r\nlecture.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am to speak of Mr. Sumner in our personal relations, which for\r\nthirteen years before his death were intimate, I shall use some words\r\nof preface.  Never on more than two occasions did we have differences\r\nthat caused any feeling on either side.  Mr. Sumner was chairman in the\r\nSenate of the Committee on the Freedmen's Bureau, and Mr. Eliot was\r\nchairman of the Committee of the House.  A report was made in each\r\nHouse, and each bill contained not less than twenty sections.  Each\r\nHouse passed its own bill.  A committee of conference was appointed.\r\nIts report was rejected.  I was appointed a member of the second\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nI examined the bills, and I marked out every section that was not\r\nessential to the working of the measure.  Four sections remained.\r\nI then added a section which provided for the lease and ultimate sale\r\nof the confiscated lands to the freedmen and refugees.  President\r\nJohnson's restoration of those lands made that section non-operative.\r\nThe committee, upon the motion of General Schenck, transferred the\r\njurisdiction of the Bureau from the Treasury to the War Department.\r\nThe bill was accepted by the committee, and passed by the two Houses.\r\n\r\nWhen within a few days I was in the Senate Chamber, Mr. Sumner came to\r\nme, and said in substance:  \"The Freedmen's Bureau Bill as it passed is\r\nof no value.  I have spent six months upon the bill, and my work has\r\ngone for nothing.  You and General Schenck cannot pretend to know as\r\nmuch as I know about the measure.\"\r\n\r\nWith some feeling, which was not justifiable, I said:  \"I have not\r\nspent six hours upon the measure, but after what you have said I will\r\nsay that the fifth section is of more value than all the sections which\r\nyou have written.\"  I did not wait for a reply.  The subject was not\r\nagain mentioned; our friendly relations were not disturbed, and it is\r\nto Mr. Sumner's credit on the score of toleration that he passed over\r\nmy rough remarks, even though he had given some reason for a retort.\r\n\r\nMy next difference from Mr. Sumner was a more serious difference, but\r\nit passed without any break in our relations.  He had not acquired the\r\nchurch-going habit, or he had renounced it, and my church-going was\r\nspasmodic rather than systematic.  Thus it became possible and\r\nagreeable for me to spend some small portion of each Sunday in his\r\nrooms.  The controversy over Mr. Motley and his removal from the post\r\nof minister to Great Britain excited Mr. Sumner to a point far beyond\r\nany excitement to which he yielded, arising from his own troubles or\r\nfrom the misfortunes of the country.  To him it was the topic of\r\nconversation at all times and in all places.  That habit I accepted at\r\nhis house with as much complacency as I could command.  Indeed, I was\r\nnot much disturbed by what he said to me in private, and certainly not\r\nby what he said in his own house, where I went from choice, and without\r\nany obligation to remain resting upon me.  In all his conversation he\r\nmade General Grant responsible for the removal of Motley, accompanied,\r\nusually, with language of censure and condemnation.  On two occasions\r\nthat were in a measure public, one of which was at a dinner given to me\r\nby Mr. Franklin Haven, a personal friend of twenty years' standing,\r\nwhen he insisted upon holding the Motley incident as the topic of\r\nconversation.  On one of these occasions, and in excitement, he turned\r\nto me and said:  \"Boutwell, you ought to have resigned when Motley\r\nwas removed.\"\r\n\r\nI said only in reply:  \"I am the custodian of my own duty.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the only personal remark that I ever made to Mr. Sumner in\r\nconnection with the removal of Motley.  The removal was the only\r\nreasonable solution of the difficulty in which Motley was involved;\r\nbut I sympathized with him in the disaster which had overtaken him,\r\nand I was not disposed to discuss the subject.  The incident at the\r\ndinner led me to make a resolution.  I called upon Mr. Sumner, and\r\nwithout accepting a seat, I said:  \"Senator, if you ever mention\r\nGeneral Grant's name in my presence, I will never again cross your\r\nthreshold.\"\r\n\r\nWithout the delay of half a minute he said:  \"Agreed.\"\r\n\r\nThere the matter ended, and the promise was kept.  In 1872, and not\r\nmany days before he left for Europe, he said:  \"I want to ask you a\r\nquestion about General Grant.\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"You know that that is a forbidden topic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I am not going to speak controversially.\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"Say on.\"\r\n\r\nHe said:  \"What do you think of Grant's election?\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"I think he will be elected.\"\r\n\r\nHe held up his hands, and in a tone of grief said:  \"You and Wilson\r\nare the only ones who tell me that he has any chance.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Europe it was apparent that his feelings in\r\nregard to the Republican Party, and especially in regard to General\r\nGrant, had undergone a great change.  Our conversations concerning\r\nGeneral Grant were resumed free from all restrictions, and without\r\nany disturbance of feeling on my part.  Not many months before his\r\ndeath Mr. Sumner made a speech in executive session that was\r\nconciliatory and just in a marked degree.  I urged him to repeat it\r\nin public session.  He seemed to regard the suggestion with favor, but\r\nthe speech was not made.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mr. Sumner had been borne down under the resolutions of\r\ncensure passed by the State of Massachusetts in disapproval of his\r\nposition in regard to the return of Confederate flags.  That resolution\r\nwas rescinded at the winter session of 1874.  The act brought to Mr.\r\nSumner the highest degree of satisfaction that it was possible for him\r\nto realize.  Above all things else of a public nature, he cherished\r\nthe good name of the commonwealth, and for himself there was nothing\r\nmore precious than her approval.  The blow was unexpected, its weight\r\nwas great, and its weight was never lessened until it was wholly\r\nremoved.  The rescinding resolutions came to me the Saturday next\r\npreceding the Wednesday when Mr. Sumner died.  I was then in ill\r\nhealth, so ill that my attendance at the Senate did not exceed one\r\nhalf of each day's session through many weeks.  Mr. Sumner called upon\r\nme to inquire, and anxious to know, whether I could attend the session\r\nof Monday and present the resolutions.  I gave him the best assurance\r\nthat my condition permitted.  When the resolutions had been presented,\r\nand when I was leaving the chamber, Mr. Sumner came to me, and, putting\r\nhis arm over my shoulder, he walked with me into the lobby, where,\r\nafter many thanks by him, and with good wishes for my health, we\r\nparted, without a thought by me that he had not before him many years\r\nof rugged life.  For several years previous to 1874, Mr. Sumner had\r\nbeen accustomed to speak of himself as an old man, and on more than one\r\noccasion he spoke of life as a burden.  To these utterances I gave but\r\nlittle heed.\r\n\r\nThe chief assurance for any considerable well-doing in the world is to\r\nbe found in good purposes and in fixedness of purpose when a purpose\r\nhas been formed.  These characteristics were Mr. Sumner's possession,\r\nbut in him they were subject to very important limitations as powers in\r\npractical affairs.  He did not exhibit respect or deference for the\r\nopinions of others even when the parties were upon a plane of equality,\r\nas is the usual situation in legislative bodies.  He could not concede\r\nsmall points for the sake of a great result.  Hence it was that\r\nmeasures in which he had an interest took on a form at the end that\r\nwas not agreeable to him.  Hence it is that he has left only one piece\r\nof legislation that is distinctly the work of his hand.  When the bill\r\nwas under consideration which denied to colored persons the privilege\r\nof naturalization in the United States, he secured an amendment by\r\nwhich the exclusion was limited to the Mongolian race.  His\r\ndeclaration as to the status of the States that had been in rebellion\r\nwas not far away from the policy that was adopted finally, but he did\r\nnot accept as wise and necessary measures the amendments to the\r\nConstitution which were designed to make that policy permanent.\r\nIndeed, it was his opinion, at one period of the controversy over the\r\nquestion of negro suffrage, that a legislative declaration would be\r\nsufficient.  The field of his success is to be found in the\r\nargumentative power that he possessed and in its use for the overthrow\r\nof slavery.  Of the anti-slavery advocates who entered the Senate\r\nprevious to the opening of the war, he was the best equipped in\r\nlearning, and his influence in the country was not surpassed by the\r\ninfluence of any one of his associates.  In his knowledge of diplomacy,\r\nhe had the first rank in the Senate for the larger part of his career.\r\nHis influence in the Senate was measured, however, by his influence in\r\nthe country.  His speeches, especially in the period of national\r\ncontroversy, were addressed _to_ the country.  He relied upon\r\nauthorities and precedents.  His powers as a debater were limited, and\r\nit followed inevitably that in purely parliamentary contests he was\r\nnot a match for such masters as Fessenden and Conkling, who in learning\r\nwere his inferiors.\r\n\r\nMy means for information are so limited that I do not express an\r\nopinion upon the question whether Mr. Sumner's ambitions in public life\r\nwere or were not gratified.  On one or two occasions he let fall\r\nremarks which indicated a willingness to be transferred to the\r\nDepartment of State.  Major Ben. Perley Poore had received the\r\nimpression that there was a time when Mr. Sumner looked to the\r\nPresidency as a possibility.  At an accidental meeting with Major\r\nPoore, he said to me:  \"I have dined with Sumner, and he gave me an\r\naccount of the conversation he had with you this morning, in which you\r\nconsoled him for not gaining the Presidency.\"\r\n\r\nI recalled the conversation.  It was a Sunday-morning talk, and there\r\nwas no special purpose on my part, however my remarks may have been\r\nreceived by Mr. Sumner.  He spoke of the opportunity furnished to Mr.\r\nJefferson for the exposition of his views in his first inaugural\r\naddress.  I then proceeded to say that, omitting the incumbent of the\r\noffice, of whom nothing could then be said, not more than three or four\r\nmen had gained in standing by their elevation to the Presidency, beyond\r\nthe fact that their names were upon the roll.  The exceptions were,\r\nfirst of all, Lincoln, who had gained most.  Then Jackson, who had\r\ngained something--indeed, a good deal by his defence of the Union when\r\ncompared with what he might have lost by neglect of duty in the days of\r\nnullification.  Washington had gained much by demonstrating his\r\ncapacity for civil affairs, by the legacy of his farewell address,\r\nand by the shaping of the new government under the Constitution in a\r\nmanner calculated to strengthen the quality of perpetuity.  At the end,\r\nI claimed that the other occupants of the Presidential office had not\r\ngained appreciably by their promotion.\r\n\r\nIn two important particulars, Samuel Adams and Charles Sumner are\r\nparallel characters in American history.  Mr. Adams was a leader in\r\nthe contest that the colonies carried on against Great Britain.  Our\r\nlegal standing in the controversy with the mother country has never\r\nelsewhere been presented as forcibly and logically as it was stated by\r\nMr. Adams in his letters to the royal governors in the name of the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives, between the years 1764 and\r\n1775.  When the contest of words and of arms was over he was not\r\nonly not an aid in the organization of the new Government, but he was\r\nan obstacle to its success.  He accepted the Constitution with\r\nhesitation and under constraint.  After the overthrow of slavery and\r\nthe ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Mr.\r\nSumner gave no wise aid to the work of reconstructing the government\r\nupon the basis of the new conditions that had been created by the war\r\nand by the abolition of slavery.  As every guarantee for freedom\r\ncontains some element of enslavement over or against some who are not\r\nwithin the guarantee, men sometimes hesitate as to the wisdom of\r\naccepting guarantees of rights in one direction which work a limitation\r\nof rights or privileges in other directions.  The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, while it gave power to the body of States and guaranteed\r\nsecurity to each yet deprived the individual States of many of the\r\nprivileges and powers that they had enjoyed as colonies.  Every\r\namendment to the Constitution, from the first to the last, has limited\r\nthe application of the doctrine of home rule in government.\r\n\r\nUpon the election of Mr. Wilson to the office of Vice-President, I was\r\nchosen by the Legislature of Massachusetts as his successor in the\r\nSenate.  I left the Treasury and General Grant's Cabinet with\r\nreluctance, but my experience in both branches of the government had\r\nled me to prefer the legislative branch, where there is at least more\r\nfreedom of action than can be had in the executive department.  This\r\nopinion is in no sense due to the nature of my relations with General\r\nGrant.   His military habits led him to put responsibility upon\r\nsubordinates and this habit he carried into civil affairs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in my own case, he recognized that fact that I had accepted\r\nthe place upon his urgent request, command indeed, and not to gratify\r\nany ambition of my own.  And further, I think I may assume, that his\r\nconfidence was such that he was content to leave the department in my\r\nhands.  During my time he put only one person--General Pleasanton--\r\ninto the department, and he never commanded or required the removal of\r\nany one.  On a few occasions he named persons whom he said he would be\r\nglad to have employed if places could be found.  They were always\r\nsoldiers, or widows or children of soldiers, and he never forgot his\r\nsuggestions, nor allowed the passage of time to diminish his interest\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nThe important places in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, New\r\nOrleans and Philadelphia were filled by him, usually upon consultation,\r\nbut upon his judgment.  He gave very little attention to others beyond\r\nsigning the commissions.  I often called his attention to the more\r\nimportant ones, but it was his practice to send applicants and their\r\nfriends to me with the remark that the business was in my hands.\r\n\r\nBy this course the President avoided much labor, and escaped some\r\nresponsibility.  The disappointed ones charged their misfortunes to\r\nthe Secretary, and the President was able to say that he knew nothing\r\nof the case, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that the President did not exhibit equal\r\nconfidence in my successors, especially in Mr. Bristow.  The President\r\nreceived the impression very early, that Bristow was engaged in a\r\nscheme to secure the nomination by an alliance with the enemies of\r\nGeneral Grant.  In my time three Secretaries of the Treasury attempted\r\nin turn to secure a nomination for the Presidency through the influence\r\nand patronage of that department.  All were failures, and failures well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nSuch a policy breeds corruption inevitably.  Venal men aspiring to\r\nplace, avow themselves the friends of the Secretary, and if through\r\nsuch avowals they secure appointments, the offices will be used for\r\nimproper purposes.\r\n\r\nMy successor, Judge Richardson, had been Assistant Secretary for three\r\nyears and more, and no one could have surpassed him in industry,\r\nfidelity and knowledge of the business.  I recommended his appointment.\r\nThe President hesitated, but he finally nominated him to the Senate,\r\nand the nomination was confirmed.\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL GRANT UPON MY RESIGNATION OF THE OFFICE OF\r\nSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON,\r\n  _March_ 17, 1873.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\nHaving been elected to the Senate of the United States by the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts, I tender my resignation of the office of\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIn severing my official relations with you it is a great satisfaction\r\nto me that on all occasions you have given me full confidence and\r\nsupport in the discharge of my public duties.\r\n\r\nIn these four years my earlier acquaintance with you has ripened into\r\nearnest personal friendship, which, I am confident, will remain\r\nunbroken.  I am\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n  GEO. S. BOUTWELL.\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\nWASHINGTON, _March_ 17, 1873.\r\n\r\nHON. GEO. S. BOUTWELL,\r\n_Dear Sir:_--\r\nIn accepting your resignation of the office of Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, an office which you have filled for four years with such\r\nsatisfaction to the country, allow me to express the regret I feel at\r\nsevering official relations which have been at all times so agreeable\r\nto me, and,--as I am assured by your letter of resignation,--to you\r\nalso.  Your administration of the important trust confided to you\r\nfour years since, has been so admirably conducted as to give the\r\ngreatest satisfaction to me because as I read public judgment and\r\nopinion it has been satisfactory to the country.  The policy pursued in\r\nthe office of Secretary of the Treasury by your successor I hope may\r\nbe as successful as yours has been, and that no departure from it\r\nwill be made except such as experience and change of circumstances\r\nmay make necessary.\r\n\r\nAmong your new official associates I trust you will find the same warm\r\nfriends and co-workers that you leave in the Executive branch of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nYou take with you my most sincere well wishes for your success as a\r\nlegislator and as a citizen, and the assurance of my desire to continue\r\nthe warm personal relations that have existed between us during the\r\nwhole of our official connection.\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\nGENERAL GRANT AS A STATESMAN*\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's father was a Whig and an admirer and supporter of Mr.\r\nClay.  The public policy of Mr. Clay embraced three great measures:\r\nFirst, a national bank, or a fiscal agency as an aid to the Treasury\r\nin the collection and disbursement of the public revenues; secondly,\r\na system of internal improvements to be created at the public expense\r\nand controlled by the National Government; and, thirdly, a tariff\r\nsystem which should protect the American laborer against the active\r\ncompetition of the laborers of other countries who were compelled to\r\nwork for smaller compensation.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1834 to the year 1836 the country was engaged in an\r\nactive controversy over the policy of the Whig Party, of which Mr.\r\nClay was then the recognized head.  Indeed, the controversy began as\r\nearly as the year 1824, and it contributed, more than all other causes,\r\nto the new organization of parties under the leadership, respectively,\r\nof Mr. Clay and General Jackson.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was educated under these influences, and in the belief\r\nthat the policy of the Whig Party would best promote the prosperity\r\nof the country.  Those early impressions ripened into opinions, which\r\nhe held and on which he acted during his public life.  It happened\r\nby the force of circumstances that the Republican Party was compelled\r\nto adopt the policy of Mr. Clay--not in measures, but in the ideas on\r\nwhich his policy was based.  It is not now necessary to inquire\r\nwhether the weight of argument was with Mr. Clay or with his opponents.\r\nThe war made inevitable the adoption of a policy which Mr. Clay had\r\nadvocated as expedient and wise.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Railways were built by the aid of the Government and under\r\nthe pressure of a general public opinion that the East must be brought\r\ninto a more intimate connection with our possessions on the Pacific\r\nOcean, for mutual support and for the common defence.\r\n\r\nThe national banking system was established for the purpose of securing\r\nthe aid of the banks as purchasers and negotiators of the bonds of the\r\nGovernment, at a time when the public credit was so impaired that it\r\nseemed impossible to command the funds necessary for the prosecution\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nThe same exigency compelled Congress to enact, and the country to\r\naccept, a tariff system more protective in its provisions than any\r\nscheme ever suggested by Mr. Clay.  The necessities of the times\r\ncompelled free-traders, even, to accept the revenue system with its\r\nprotective features; but General Grant accepted it as a system in\r\nharmony alike with his early impressions and with his matured opinions.\r\n\r\nIt has happened, by the force of events, that the policy of the old\r\nWhig Party has been revived in the national banking system, while the\r\nIndependent Treasury, the leading measure of the old Democratic Party,\r\nhas been preserved in all its features as the guide of the Treasury\r\nDepartment in its financial operations.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant became President, these three measures had been\r\nincorporated into the policy of the Republican Party.  Their full\r\nacceptance by him did not require any change of opinion on his part.\r\nIt was true that he had voted for Mr. Buchanan in 1856; but his vote\r\nwas given in obedience to an impression that he had received touching\r\nthe qualifications of General Fremont.  The fact that he had voted\r\nfor Mr. Buchanan excited suspicions in the minds of some Republicans,\r\nand it engendered hopes in the bosoms of some Democrats that he might\r\nact in harmony with the Democratic Party.  The suspicions and the\r\nhopes were alike groundless.\r\n\r\nAs early as the month of August, 1863, in a letter to Mr. E. B.\r\nWashburne, he said:  \"It became patent to my mind early in the\r\nrebellion that the North and South could never live at peace with\r\neach other except as one nation, and that without slavery.  As anxious\r\nas I am to see peace established, I would not, therefore, be willing\r\nto see any settlement until this question is forever settled.\"\r\n\r\nThus was General Grant, at an early moment, and upon his own judgment,\r\nbrought into full accord with the Republican Party upon the two\r\ndebatable and most earnestly debated questions during Mr. Lincoln's\r\nadministration--the prosecution of the war and the abolition of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is apparent that in 1868 he was in a condition, as to all\r\nmatters of opinion, to accept a nomination at the hands of the\r\nRepublican Party; and it is equally apparent that he was separated\r\nfrom the Democratic Party by a chasm wide, deep, and impassable.  It\r\nis, however, true that General Grant's feelings were not intense, and\r\nin the expression of his opinions his tone was mild and his manner\r\ngentle.  It often happened, also, that he did not undertake to\r\ncontrovert opinions and expressions with which he had no sympathy.\r\nThis peculiarity may at times have led to a misunderstanding, or to\r\na misinterpretation of his views.  Upon this basis of his early\r\nimpressions, and matured opinions his administrative policy was\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nWhen he became President, there was a body of American citizens, not\r\ninconsiderable in numbers, who doubted the ability of the Government\r\nto pay the war debt; there were others who advocated payment in\r\ngreenbacks, or the substitution of a note not bearing interest for a\r\nbond that bore interest; and there were yet others who denied the\r\nvalidity of the existing obligations.  All these classes, whether they\r\nwere dishonest or only misled, were alike rebuked in his inaugural\r\naddress.  These were his words:  \"A great debt has been contracted\r\nin securing to us and to our posterity the Union.  The payment of this\r\ndebt, principal and interest, as well as the return to a specie basis,\r\nas soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the\r\ndebtor class, or to the country at large, must be provided for. . . .\r\nTo protect the national honor, every dollar of Government indebtedness\r\nshould be paid in gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the\r\ncontract. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Let it be understood that no repudiator of one farthing of our public\r\ndebt will be trusted in public place, and it will go far toward\r\nstrengthening a credit which ought to be the best in the world, and\r\nwill ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing less\r\ninterest than we now pay.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same address he asserted the ability of the country to pay the\r\ndebt within the period of twenty-five years, and he also declared his\r\npurpose to secure a faithful collection of the public revenues.  At\r\nthe close of his administration of eight years one fifth part of the\r\npublic debt had been paid, and if the system of taxation that existed\r\nin 1869 had been continued the debt would have been extinguished in\r\nless than a quarter of a century from the year 1869.  In his\r\nadministration, however, the crisis was passed.  The ability and the\r\ndisposition of the country were made so conspicuous that all honest\r\ndoubts were removed, and the repudiators were shamed into silence.\r\nThe redemption of the debt by the purchase of bonds in the open market\r\nstrengthened the public credit, and laid a foundation for the\r\nresumption of specie payments.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's inaugural address was followed by the passage of the\r\nact of March 18, 1869, entitled \"An act to strengthen the public\r\ncredit.\"  This act was a pledge to the world that the debts of the\r\nUnited States, unless there were in the obligations express\r\nstipulations to the contrary, would be paid in coin.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nPresident Grant, in his annual message of December, 1869, recommended\r\nthe passage of an act authorizing the funding of the public debt at a\r\nlower rate of interest.\r\n\r\nFollowing this recommendation, the bill for refunding the public debt,\r\nprepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, was enacted and approved\r\nJuly 14, 1870.\r\n\r\nBy this act the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to issue bonds\r\nto the amount of $200,000,000 bearing interest at the rate of 5 per\r\ncent, $300,000,000 bearing interest at the rate of 4˝ per cent, and\r\n$1,000,000,000 bearing interest at the rate of 4 per cent.\r\n\r\nUnder this act, and the amendments thereto, the debt has been refunded\r\nfrom time to time until the average rate of interest does not now\r\nexceed 3˝ per cent.  Although these two important measures of\r\nadministration were not prepared by General Grant, they were but the\r\nexecution of his policy set forth in his inaugural address.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the rights of the negro race, General Grant must be\r\nranked with the advanced portion of the Republican Party.  Upon the\r\ncapture of Fort Donelson, a number of slaves fell into the hands of the\r\nUnion army.  General Grant issued an order, dated Feb. 26, 1862, in\r\nwhich he authorized their employment for the benefit of the Government,\r\nand at the close he said that under no circumstances would he permit\r\ntheir return to their masters.\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural address he urged the States to ratify the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment, and its ratification was due, probably, to his advice.  At\r\nthat moment his influence was very great.  It may well be doubted\r\nwhether any other President ever enjoyed the confidence of the country\r\nin as high a degree.  He gave to that measure the weight of his opinion\r\nand the official influence of his administration.  The amendment was\r\nopposed by the Democratic Party generally, and a considerable body of\r\nRepublicans questioned its wisdom.  General Grant was responsible for\r\nthe ratification of the amendment.  Had he advised its rejection, or\r\nhad he been indifferent to its fate, the amendment would have failed,\r\nand the country would have been left to a succession of bitter\r\ncontroversies arising from the application of the second section of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, which provided that the representation of a State\r\nshould be based upon the number of male citizens over twenty-one years\r\nof age entitled to vote.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant accepted the plan of Congress in regard to the\r\nreconstruction of the Union.  There were three opinions that had\r\nobtained a lodgment in the public mind.  President Johnson and his\r\nsupporters claimed that the President held the power by virtue of his\r\noffice to convene the people of the respective States, and that under\r\nhis direction constitutions might be framed, and that Senators and\r\nRepresentatives might be chosen who would be entitled to seats in\r\nCongress, as though they represented States that had not been engaged\r\nin secession and war.  Others maintained that neither by the ordinances\r\nof secession nor by the war had the States of the Confederacy been\r\ndisturbed in their legal relations to the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was the theory of the Republican Party in Congress that the eleven\r\nStates by their own acts had destroyed their legal relations to the\r\nUnion; that the jurisdiction of the National Government over the\r\nterritory of the seceding States was full and complete; and that, as\r\na result of the war, the National Government could hold them in a\r\nTerritorial condition and subject to military rule.  Upon this theory\r\nthe re-appearance of a seceded State as a member of the Union was made\r\nto depend upon the assent of Congress, with the approval of the\r\nPresident, or upon an act of Congress by a two-thirds vote over a\r\nPresidential veto.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant sustained the policy of Congress during the long and\r\nbitter contest with President Johnson, and when he became President\r\nhe accepted that policy without reserve in the case of the restoration\r\nof the States of Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and Mississippi.  Upon this\r\nstatement it appears that General Grant was a Republican, and that he\r\nbecame a Republican by processes that preclude the suggestion that his\r\nnomination for the Presidency wrought any change in his position upon\r\nquestions of principle or policy in the affairs of government.  Indeed,\r\nhis nomination in 1868 was distasteful to him, as he then preferred to\r\nremain at the head of the army.  It was in the nature of things,\r\nhowever, that he should have wished for re-election.  He was re-\r\nelected, and at the end of his second term he accepted a return to\r\nprivate life as a relief from the cares and duties of office.  The\r\nsupport which he received for the nomination in 1880 was not due to\r\nany effort on his part.  Not even to his warmest supporters did he\r\nexpress a wish, or dictate or advise an act.  His only utterance was\r\na message to four of his friends at the Chicago Convention, that\r\nwhatever they might do in the premises would be acceptable to him.\r\nHis political career was marked by the same abstention from personal\r\neffort for personal advancement that distinguished him as an officer\r\nof the army.  But he did not bring into civil affairs the habits of\r\ncommand that were the necessity of military life.  Although by virtue\r\nof his position he was the recognized head of the Republican Party,\r\nhe made no effort to control its action.  Wherever he placed power,\r\nthere he reposed trust.\r\n\r\nThere was not in General Grant's nature any element of suspicion, and\r\nhis confidence in his friends was free and full.  Hence it happened\r\nthat he had many occasions for regret.\r\n\r\nOn no man in public life in this generation were there more frequent\r\ncharges and insinuations of wrong-doing, and in this generation there\r\nhas been no man in public life who was freer from all occasion for\r\nsuch insinuations and charges.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that the Treasury Department was purchasing bullion of\r\na company in which he was a stockholder, he sold his shares without\r\ndelay, and without reference to the market price or to their real value.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had no disposition to usurp power.  He had no policy to\r\nimpose upon the country against the popular will.  This was shown in\r\nthe treatment of the Santo Domingo question.  General Grant was not\r\nindisposed to see the territories of the Republic extended, but his\r\nlove of justice and fair dealing was such that he would have used\r\nonly honorable means in his intercourse with other nations.  Santo\r\nDomingo was a free offering, and he thought that its possession would\r\nbe advantageous to the country.\r\n\r\nYet he never made it an issue, even in his Cabinet, where, as he well\r\nknew, very serious doubts existed as to the expediency of the measure.\r\nHe was deeply pained by the unjust attacks and groundless criticism\r\nof which he was the subject, but he accepted the adverse judgment of\r\nthe Senate as a constitutional binding decision of the question, and\r\nof that decision he never complained.\r\n\r\nIn a message to the Senate of the 31st of May, 1870, he urged the\r\nannexation of Santo Domingo.  He said, \"I feel an unusual anxiety for\r\nthe ratification of this treaty, because I believe it will redound\r\ngreatly to the glory of the two countries interested, to civilization,\r\nand to the extirpation of the institution of slavery.\"  He claimed for\r\nthe scheme great commercial advantages, that it was in harmony with the\r\nMonroe doctrine, and that the consummation of the measure would be\r\nnotice to the states of Europe that no acquisitions of territory on\r\nthis continent would be permitted.  In his second inaugural address\r\nGeneral Grant referred to the subject in these words:  \"In the first\r\nyear of the past administration the proposition came up for the\r\nadmission of Santo Domingo as a Territory of the Union. . . . I believe\r\nnow, as I did then, that it was for the best interests of this country,\r\nfor the people of Santo Domingo, and all concerned, that the\r\nproposition should be received favorably.  It was, however, rejected\r\nconstitutionally, and therefore the subject was never brought up\r\nagain by me.\"  General Grant considered the failure of the treaty as\r\na national misfortune, but he never criticised the action of its\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's firmness was shown in his veto of the Senate currency\r\nbill of 1874.  It is known that unusual effort was made to convince\r\nhim that the measure was wise in a financial view, and highly expedient\r\nupon political grounds.  The President wrote a message in explanation\r\nof his act of approval, but upon its completion he was so much\r\ndissatisfied with his own argument that he resolved to veto the bill.\r\nHence the veto message of April 22, 1874.\r\n\r\nIn foreign policy, the principal measure of General Grant's\r\nadministration was the treaty with Great Britain of May, 1871.  The\r\nspecific and leading purpose of the negotiations was the adjustment\r\nof the claim made by the United States that Great Britain was liable\r\nin damages for the destruction of American vessels, and the consequent\r\nloss of commercial power and prestige, by the depredations of\r\nConfederate cruisers that were fitted out or had obtained supplies in\r\nBritish ports.  Neither the treaty of peace of 1783, nor the subsequent\r\ntreaties with Great Britain, made a full and final settlement of the\r\nfishery question or of our northern boundary-line at its junction\r\nwith the Pacific Ocean.  These outlying questions were considered in\r\nthe negotiations, and they were adjusted by the terms of the treaty.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the island of San Juan on the Pacific coast, then\r\nin controversy, was referred to the Emperor of Germany as arbitrator,\r\nwith full and final power in the premises.  By his award the claim of\r\nthe United States was sustained.\r\n\r\nThe fishery question was referred to arbitrators, but it was a\r\nmisfortune that the award was not satisfactory to the United States,\r\nand the dispute is reopened with capacity to vex the two governments\r\nfor an indefinite period of time.\r\n\r\nThe claims against Great Britain growing out of the operations of the\r\nConfederate cruisers, known as the Alabama claims, were referred to\r\narbitrators, by whose award the Government of the United States\r\nreceived the sum of $15,500,000.  But the value of the treaty of 1871\r\nwas not in the award made.  The people of the United States were\r\nembittered against the Government of Great Britain, and had General\r\nGrant chosen to seek redress by arms he would have been sustained\r\nthroughout the North with substantial unanimity.  But General Grant\r\nwas destitute of the war spirit, and he chose to exhaust all the powers\r\nof negotiation before he would advise a resort to force.  A passage\r\nin his inaugural address may have had an influence upon the policy of\r\nthe British Government:  \"In regard to foreign policy, I would deal\r\nwith nations as equitable law requires individuals to deal with each\r\nother. . . . I would respect the rights of all nations, demanding\r\nequal respect for our own.  _If others depart from this rule in their\r\ndealings with us, we may be compelled to follow their precedent.\"_\r\n\r\nThe reference of the question at issue to the tribunal at Geneva was\r\na conspicuous instance of the adjustment of a grave international\r\ndispute by peaceful methods.\r\n\r\nBy the sixth article of the treaty of 1871, three new rules were made\r\nfor the government of neutral nations.  These rules are binding upon\r\nthe United States and Great Britain, and the contracting parties\r\nagreed to bring them to the knowledge of other maritime powers, and\r\nto invite such powers to accede to the rules.\r\n\r\nIn those rules it is stipulated that a neutral nation should not\r\npermit a belligerent to fit out, arm, or equip in its ports any vessel\r\nwhich it has reasonable ground to believe is intended to cruise or\r\ncarry on war against a power with which it is at peace.  It was further\r\nagreed, as between the parties to the treaty, that neither would\r\nsuffer a belligerent to make use of its ports or waters as a base of\r\noperations against the other.  Finally, the parties agreed to use due\r\ndiligence to prevent any infraction of the rules so established.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish was then Secretary of State, and to him was General Grant and\r\nthe country largely indebted for the settlement of the Alabama\r\ncontroversy; but the settlement was in harmony with General Grant's\r\ninaugural address.\r\n\r\nBefore the final adjustment of the controversy, by the decision of the\r\ntribunal at Geneva, General Grant had occasion to consider whether\r\nthe allegation against Great Britain, growing out of her recognition,\r\nin May, 1861, of the belligerent character of the Confederacy, could\r\nbe maintained upon the principles of public law.  Upon his own judgment\r\nhe reached the conclusion that the act was an act of sovereignty within\r\nthe discretion of the ruler, for which a claim in money could not be\r\nmade.  This opinion was accepted, finally, by his advisers, by the\r\nnegotiators, and by the country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was not a trained statesman.  His methods of action were\r\ndirect and clear.  His conduct was free from duplicity, and artifice of\r\nevery sort was foreign to his nature.  In the first years of his\r\nadministration he relied upon his Cabinet in all minor matters relating\r\nto the departments.  Acting upon military ideas, he held the head of a\r\ndepartment to his full responsibility, and he waited, consequently,\r\nuntil his opinion was sought or his instructions were solicited.\r\n\r\nIn his conferences with the members of his Cabinet he expressed his\r\nopinions with the greatest freedom, and, upon discussion, he often\r\nyielded to the suggestions or arguments of others.  He was so great\r\nthat it was not a humiliation to acknowledge a change in opinion, or\r\nto admit an error in policy or purpose.\r\n\r\nIn his intercourse with members of Congress upon the business of the\r\nGovernment, he gave his opinions without reserve when he had reached\r\ndefinite conclusions, but he often remained a silent listener to the\r\ndiscussion of topics which he had not considered maturely.\r\n\r\nHis politics were not narrow nor exclusive.  He believed in the growth\r\nof the country, and in the power of republican ideas.  He was free from\r\nrace prejudice, and free from national jealousy, but he believed in the\r\nenlargement of our territory by peaceful means, in the spread of\r\nrepublican institutions, and in the predominance of the English-\r\nspeaking race in the affairs of the world.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of philanthropy animated his politics, and the doctrines of\r\npeace controlled his public policy.\r\n\r\n[* This article was printed in Appleton's Cyclopedia for the year 1885.\r\nCopyright, 1886, by D. Appleton & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\nREMINISCENCES OF PUBLIC MEN\r\n\r\nGENERAL BANKS\r\n\r\nOf the men whom I have known in public affairs, General Banks was in\r\nhis personality one of a small number who were always agreeable and\r\npermanently attractive.  He was the possessor of an elastic spirit;\r\nhe was always hopeful of the future and in adversity he saw or fancied\r\nthat he saw, days of prosperity for himself, for his party, for the\r\ncommonwealth and for the country.  His interest in the fortunes of the\r\nlaboring classes was a permanent interest, and they are largely\r\nindebted to him for the passage of the eight-hour law by the Congress\r\nof the United States.  Not infrequently his thoughts and schemes were\r\ntoo vast for realization.  While the contest in Kansas was going on,\r\nhe suggested an organization of capitalists for the purchase of the\r\nlow-priced lands in Delaware, then a sale to Northern farmers and the\r\nconversion of Delaware into a free State.\r\n\r\nHis studies in law had been fragmentary and superficial, and nature had\r\nnot endowed him with all the qualities that are essential to the\r\nsuccessful lawyer.  His reading on the literary side was considerable,\r\nespecially in the Spanish language.  Early in life he accepted the idea\r\nthat our relations with the Spanish race were to be intimate in a not\r\nfar off future.  He was a careful observer of character, and of\r\nconditions in affairs, and in a free debate he was never in peril of\r\nbeing overmatched.  Of a mutual friend and an associate in politics\r\nhe said:  \"He has no serious side to his character--a defect that has\r\nbeen the bane of many otherwise able men.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the coalition came into power Banks was made speaker of the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives.  Wilson was president of the\r\nSenate and I was in the office of Governor.  In an evening stroll with\r\nBanks around Boston Common, engaged in a survey of public affairs,\r\nhe changed the conversation suddenly with the remark:  \"It's almighty\r\nqueer that the people of this commonwealth have put their government\r\ninto the hands of men who have no last and usual place of abode.\"  The\r\npertinency of this remark is to be found in the facts to which it was\r\napplicable.  There were some men of wealth in the Coalition Party but\r\nthe three places that I have named were held by men who were destitute\r\nof even the means of well-to-do mechanics and tradespeople.\r\n\r\nMr. Banks had power in repartee which made him a formidable adversary\r\nin parliamentary debate.  When he was a mechanic at Waltham he took\r\nan active part in temperance meetings.  At one of the meetings a\r\nUnitarian clergyman of conservative leanings, made a speech in which he\r\ncriticized the speeches and said finally:  \"I do not attend the\r\nmeetings because I cannot approve of what I hear said.\"  He then\r\nreferred to Mr. Banks as a young man who was guilty of indiscretions\r\nin speech.  He had seen him once only at his church.  He had made\r\ninquiries of his brethren and he could not learn that Mr. Banks was a\r\nregular attendant at any church.  Banks in reply admitted that he had\r\nbeen in the church of the reverend gentleman but once, and that he was\r\nnot a regular attendant at any church.  Said he:  \"I do not go to\r\nchurch because I hear things said there which I do not approve.\"  The\r\nreverend gentleman was forced to join in the general laugh which was\r\nraised at his expense.\r\n\r\nTwo extracts from General Banks' letters, written to me during the war\r\nmay give an idea of his characteristics in his maturer years.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, CAMP AT DAMSTOWN, MD.\r\n_October_ 15, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--\r\nI received your letter of the 8th inst . . . and also one of an earlier\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear from you.  I see few people and hear little news\r\nfrom home.  Newspapers I have little relish for and scarcely time to\r\nread them, if I had.\r\n\r\nI am glad to know that you contemplate the army for a pursuit.  Our\r\npeople will in the end surrender all business except that of the war,\r\nand that which pertains to the war.  Our country is in a sad condition.\r\nIt is already clear that the influence of France and England is against\r\nus.  How sadly all our anticipations in regard to the war have failed\r\nus,--the insurrection of the blacks, the material deficiencies of the\r\nSouth, their want of men, and worst of all the friendship or the\r\nindifference of England.  We have now, or shall have by and by to do\r\nwhat we should have done at the start, rely upon ourselves and prepare\r\nfor our work upon a scale proportionate to its magnitude.  It would\r\namuse you to know how far the highest civil authority is subordinated\r\nto military direction.  I do not doubt in the slightest degree the\r\nsuccess of the Government in the end, but it grieves me to see how\r\nslow we have been and still are in comprehension and preparation.\r\n\r\nThis continent is just as important to England and France as it is to\r\nus.  It is hardly to be doubted that they will postpone all\r\ninternational questions, and secure what has never before been offered\r\nto them--a controlling foothold here.  How many times I have spoken to\r\nyou in the old Executive Chamber of the importance to the whole world\r\nof the possession of Mexico--and of the power it would infallibly give\r\nto this continent, as in Europe to those who possessed it.  And now\r\nSpain, France, and England are there.  \"Birnam Wood _has_ to great\r\nDunsinane come.\"  There is but one remedy for us.  Every male creature\r\nborn and unborn must become a soldier.  Soldiers do not criticize, so\r\nyou must consider this _Private_.  And believe me very truly yours,\r\netc.\r\n  N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF.\r\n  _New Orleans, 27 Decr._ 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--\r\nI have written to the President upon the subject of a free State\r\norganization in Louisiana.  It appears quite certain to me that the\r\ncourse pursued here by the officers to whom the matter is entrusted\r\nwill not lead to an early or a certain result.  It will not be\r\naccomplished sooner than August or September, and then will be involved\r\nin the struggles of the Presidential contest, and very likely share\r\nthe fate of that struggle.  It certainly ought not to be dependent upon\r\nthat issue, and settled, not only independent of it, but before it\r\nopens.  It can be easily done, in March.  A Free State government upon\r\nthe basis of immediate emancipation can be acquired as early as March\r\nwith the general consent of the People, and without any material\r\nopposition, in such a manner as to draw after it _all_ the Southern\r\nStates, on the same basis, and by the same general consent.  But it\r\ncannot be done in the manner now proposed here.  It is upon this subject\r\nthat I have written the President.  Three months ago I wrote him upon\r\nthe same idea but did not send my letter.  Subsequent reflection and\r\ninquiry have made the theory so clear to mind that I felt impelled\r\nto put my views before him.  I write this as from the request of my\r\nprevious letter you may have spoken to him upon the subject of the\r\nDepart't and the reorganization of the State.  The election of next\r\nyear does not seem as clear to me as it appears to you.  I fancy it to\r\nbe a struggle between the Democratic Party, backed by the entire power\r\nof the regular army and the People.  It will be a contest of great\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * *\r\nThe report of General Halleck is singularly incorrect, in its references\r\nto the Department--so much so that it is impossible to attribute them\r\nto anything else but misapprehension of facts.  I refer to that which\r\nrelates to Galveston, and the movement against Port Hudson in April.\r\nIf it were not so palpable, I shd think the Department hostile & shd be\r\nvery glad to know if you see or hear anything to indicate such feeling\r\ntowards me.  General Wilson would probably know the facts.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Consul here, said to me the other day that he was confident\r\nthat Maximilian would not go to Mexico.  He is a sensible and well\r\ninformed man, and I have confidence in his opinion.  I shall send you\r\nby Satds mail _three_ despatches from Europe of recent date.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n  N. P. BANKS.\r\n  M. G. C.\r\nHON. GEO. S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the conclusion of my remarks upon General Banks, I refer to my final\r\nand unexaggerated estimate of General Banks as given in the chapter on\r\nthe Legislature of 1849 (Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\nGENERAL SHERMAN, GENERAL SHERIDAN AND GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Sherman removed the last member of the triumvirate\r\nof soldiers who achieved the highest distinction in the Civil War.  In\r\nthe Senate one speaker gave him the highest place, but on the contrary\r\nI cannot rank him above either Grant or Sheridan.  When we consider the\r\nvastness of the command with which Grant was entrusted through a period\r\nof more than a year, the magnitude and success of his operations, and\r\nthe tenacity with which he prosecuted all his varied undertakings, it\r\nmust appear that neither Sherman nor Sheridan was entitled to the\r\nposition of a rival.  As to Sherman, I can say from a long and intimate\r\nacquaintance with him, and under circumstances when his real feeling\r\nwould have been disclosed, that he never assumed an equality with Grant.\r\n\r\nAs between Sherman and Sheridan it is not easy to settle the question\r\nof pre-eminence.  For myself the test would be this:  Assume that Grant\r\nhad disappeared during the Battle of the Wilderness, would the fortunes\r\nof the country have been best promoted, probably, by the appointment of\r\nSherman or Sheridan?  I cannot now say what my opinion would have been\r\nin 1864, but I should now have pronounced for Sheridan.  He was more\r\ncool and careful in regard to the plan of operations and equally bold\r\nand vigorous in execution.  General Grant expressed the opinion to me\r\nin conversation that Sheridan was the best officer in the army.  He\r\nspoke of his care and coolness in the preparation of his plans and his\r\ncelerity in execution.  Of \"the younger set of officers\" he placed Ames\r\n(Adelbert) as the most promising.\r\n\r\nIn one of my last conversations with Sheridan he expressed the opinion\r\nthat the improvement in the material of war was so great that nations\r\ncould not make war, such would be the destruction of human life.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Germany at the end of the Franco-Prussian War, he\r\nspoke very disparagingly of the military movements and among several\r\nthings he said that the French forces were placed where the Germans\r\nwould have dictated had they had the power.  He added the either of\r\nour armies at the close of the war could have marched over the country\r\nin defiance of both the French and German forces combined.  This was a\r\nrash remark, probably; a remark which he could not justify upon the\r\nfacts.  Without intending to betray any confidence, the remark, as\r\ncoming through me, got into the newspapers.  Sheridan with a skill\r\nsuperior to that of politicians caused the announcement to be made\r\nthat General Sheridan had never had any conversation with Governor\r\nBoutwell in regard to the Franco-Prussian war.\r\n\r\nAt the end it may be claimed justly, that they were three great\r\nsoldiers--that they served the country with equal fidelity--that they\r\nlived and acted without the manifestation in either of a feeling of\r\nrivalry, and that they earned the public gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Sherman was followed to two contradictory\r\nstatements from his sons.  The younger, Tecumseh, is reported as saying\r\nthat his father was never a Catholic, while the older, Thomas, who is\r\na priest of the Order of Jesuits, had stated over his signature that\r\nhis father was baptized as a Catholic, was married as a Catholic, and\r\nthat he had heard him say often, \"that if there was any true religion\r\nit was the Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nAll this may be true and yet General Sherman may not have been a\r\nCatholic.  His baptism may have been without his consent or knowledge,\r\nhis marriage by the Catholic Church may have been in deference to his\r\nwife's wishes, and because he was wholly indifferent to the matter,\r\nand the remark may have been made in the impression that there was no\r\ntrue religion, and that the Catholic was as likely, or even more likely\r\nto be true, than any other.\r\n\r\nThe statement made by Thomas puts an imputation upon General Sherman\r\nthat he ought not to bear.  Of the thousands that one may meet in a\r\nlifetime, General Sherman was among the freest from anything in the\r\nnature of hypocrisy or dissimulation.  Of those who knew him intimately\r\nafter the close of the war there are but few, probably, who did not\r\nhear him speak with hostility and bitterness of the Catholic Church.\r\nFor myself I can say that I heard him speak in terms of contempt of\r\nthe church.  On one occasion with reference to fasts and abstinence\r\nfrom meat of Friday, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I know better than these priests what I want to eat.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman was not a friend to the Catholic Church in the last\r\nyears of his life and there is no honor in the attempt to enroll his\r\nname among its devotees now that he is dead and cannot speak for himself.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY WINDOM\r\n\r\nFuneral services were performed February 2, 1891, at the Church of the\r\nCovenant in Washington in honor of Mr. Windom, late Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  He made a good record, if not a distinguished one.  As a\r\nmember of the House of Representatives and of the Senate he was noted\r\nfor fairness, for freedom from bitterness of opinion upon party\r\nquestions, and for good sense in action.\r\n\r\nHe was indisposed to take responsibility and he went no farther than\r\nthe case in hand seemed to require.  As the head of the Treasury he was\r\nanxious to gather opinions upon matters of general public interest, and\r\nit was in his nature to strive to accommodate his action to the public\r\nopinion, if he could do so without serious consequences.  He worked\r\nwithin narrow limits, the limits set by business and politics.  Of\r\nenemies he had but few--of warm friends but few--the many had confidence\r\nin his integrity in the affairs of government, and in his ability to\r\nguide those affairs in ordinary times.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL\r\n\r\nIn a number of the _Edinburgh Review_ is an article on James Russell\r\nLowell in which the writer errs widely in two particulars as to the\r\neffect of the \"Biglow Papers.\"  The writer's name is not given, but\r\nhe is not an American and he is ignorant, probably, of America as it\r\nwas from 1830 to 1850.  When the \"Biglow Papers\" appeared, I was a\r\nDemocrat, and I am quite sure that the publication produced no effect,\r\nnot even the least, upon the opinions of Democrats or the action of\r\nthe Democratic Party.  Upon my knowledge of the Democratic Party I can\r\nsay with confidence that the writer is in error when he says:  \"He\r\n(Lowell) converted many bigoted Northern Democrats to a course of\r\naction in conflict with their old party relations and apparent\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\nFor this broad statement there is no evidence.  The first break came\r\nin 1848 and it was due to rivalries in the Democratic Party.  If the\r\n\"Biglow Papers\" played any part it was too unimportant to produce an\r\nappreciable result.  They were treated as a fortunate _jeu d'esprit_\r\nthat everybody enjoyed, but the Democratic Party did not change its\r\npolicy nor did it lose adherents.  The Mexican War was prosecuted\r\nand bigotry political and religious continued to flourish.  They may\r\nhave contributed though, insensibly, to a public opinion that became\r\nformidable in the end but the effect was not as perceptible as was\r\nthe effect of Garrison's legend that slavery was a covenant with hell\r\nand a league with death, which had its place at the head of the\r\n_Liberator_ through successive years.  Nor do I believe that \"it\r\nrevolutionized the tone of Northern society.\"  Indeed, there is a\r\n\"tone\" of Northern society that has not been revolutionized to this\r\nday.  The South is still the land of gentle birth.  The slave-holder\r\nstill lives as a man of breeding and the owner of estates.  The negro\r\nis still of an inferior caste and in some circles the days of slavery\r\nwere the great days of the Republic.  When the \"Biglow Papers\" appeared\r\nMr. Lowell had not achieved distinction.  Society did not know him to\r\nfollow him.  It cared nothing for what he thought, and it was only\r\namused by what he said.  The Lowell of 1840 was not the Lowell of 1890.\r\nNor can any series of statements be more untruthful and absurd than\r\nthe statements of the writer that \"thenceforth it became creditable to\r\nadvocate abolition in drawing rooms, and to preach it from fashionable\r\ncity pulpits to congregations paying fancy prices for their pews.  In\r\nthe workshops, the barrooms and other popular resorts the laugh was\r\nturned against the slave-owners; the ground was prepared for the popular\r\nenthusiasm which recruited the armies that exhausted the South, and\r\nLowell must share with Lincoln and Grant the glory of the crowning\r\nvictories.\"\r\n\r\nIf any work of romance contains more fiction in the same space, it is\r\nmy fortune not to have seen that work.  The circulation of the _Boston\r\nCourier_ in which the papers were printed was very limited.  It did not\r\ngo into barrooms nor into workshops.  It was read chiefly by the\r\nconverted and semi-converted abolitionists.  As to fashionable pulpits\r\nthenceforth preaching abolition it is to be said that there was only\r\none leading pulpit, Theodore Parker's pulpit, in which abolitionism was\r\ntolerated until years after the appearance of the \"Biglow Papers.\"  As\r\nto society, it is to be said that in the Fifties Charles Sumner, a\r\nSenator, was ostracized for his opinions upon slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is nearer the truth to say that what passes for society in New\r\nEngland never tolerated abolitionists nor encouraged abolitionism.\r\n\r\nThe one writing which in an historical point of view contributed most\r\nlargely to recruit the armies of the Republic during the Rebellion was\r\nWebster's speech in reply to Hayne.  The closing paragraph of the\r\nspeech was in the schoolbooks of the free States, and it had been\r\ndeclaimed from many a schoolhouse stage.\r\n\r\nLowell deserves credit for what he did.  He chose his place early and\r\nfirmly on the anti-slavery side, but it is absurd and false to say that\r\nthenceforward and therefor abolitionism became popular and abolitionists\r\nthe sought for or the accepted by society.  Mr. Lowell was the son of a\r\nBoston Unitarian clergyman.  In the Forties he had not gained standing\r\nground for himself, to omit all thought of his ability to carry an\r\nunpopular cause.\r\n\r\nIndeed, up to the time of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise the\r\nwhole array of anti-slavery writers and speakers had not accomplished\r\nthe results which the reviewer attributes to the \"Biglow Papers.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, should there be a signal reform in the fashion and cost of\r\nladies' dresses it might with equal propriety be attributed to Butler's\r\npoem \"Nothing to Wear.\"\r\n\r\nGENERAL GARFIELD AND GENERAL ROSECRANS\r\n\r\nThe statement is revived that General Garfield, when chief of the staff\r\nof General Rosecrans in the campaign which ended at Chickamauga was\r\nfalse to Rosecrans.  The allegation and the fact are that he wrote to\r\nMr. Chase, then in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, that Rosecrans was incompetent\r\nto the command.  Garfield's statements, as I recall the letters, were\r\nfree from malice and the professional and ethical question is, \"Was\r\nGarfield justified as a citizen and soldier, in giving his opinion to\r\nthe Administration?\"  His view of Rosecrans was confirmed by events, and\r\nit may be assumed that the opinion was free from any improper influence\r\nwhen the letters were written.  On this assured basis of facts I cannot\r\ndoubt that Garfield did only what was his duty.  Neither the President\r\nnor the War Department could obtain specific knowledge of the officers\r\nin command except through associates and subordinates unless they\r\ntrusted to newspapers and casual visitors to the army.  The struggle\r\nwas a desperate one and the volunteer army was composed of men who were\r\ncitizens before they were soldiers and they remained citizens when they\r\nbecame soldiers.  Garfield was of the citizen soldiery and to him and\r\nto the country the etiquette of the army and the etiquette of society\r\nwere subordinate to the fortunes of the nation.  Of General Rosecrans'\r\nunfitness for any important command there can be no doubt.  After the\r\ndisaster of Chickamauga, Rosecrans was relieved and General Thomas was\r\nput in command and General Grant was ordered to the field.  He met\r\nRosecrans at Nashville where they had an interview.  From General Grant\r\nI received the statement that Rosecrans had sound views as to the means\r\nof relieving the army; \"And,\" said General Grant, \"my wonder was that\r\nhe had not put them in execution.\"\r\n\r\nThis one fact expresses enough of the weak side of Rosecrans as a\r\nmilitary leader to warrant the opinion given to Chase by Garfield,\r\nand that opinion having been formed upon a knowledge of facts and of\r\nRosecrans as a military man and not from prejudice or rivalry, Garfield\r\nshould be honored for his course, rather than condemned.\r\n\r\nGEORGE BANCROFT\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr. Bancroft at the age of more than ninety years removes\r\none of the few men in private life who can be ranked as personages.  He\r\nwas, perhaps, the only person in private life whose death would have\r\nreceived a semi-public recognition from any of the rulers of Europe.\r\nSuch a recognition was accorded by the Emperor of Germany, and chiefly,\r\nas it is understood, on account of the friendship which existed between\r\nMr. Bancroft and the grandfather of the present Emperor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft's long and successful career as a writer and diplomatist\r\nwould seem to be evidence of the presence of qualities of a high order,\r\nand yet no one who was near him accepted that opinion.  His\r\nconversation was not instructive, certainly not in later years, nor was\r\nhe an original thinker upon any subject.  He was an enthusiast in\r\npolitics in early and middle life, and while his mental faculties\r\nremained unimpaired his interest in political movements was great--and\r\nusually it was in sympathy with the Democratic Party.  He was an\r\nadhesive man in politics, capable of appearing to be reconciled to the\r\nsuccess of his opponents and ready to accept favors from them in the\r\nway of office and honors and yet without in fact committing himself\r\nto their policy.\r\n\r\nHe was a laborious student, and he had access to standard and in many\r\nparticulars to original authorities.  At the commencement of his history\r\nhe erred in denying with much confidence the claim of the visits of the\r\nNorthmen to this continent in the ninth and tenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThat early claim seems to be supported by evidence which is nearly, if\r\nnot absolutely, conclusive.  Of all his chapters that on Washington\r\nwas most attractive to me and it is quite the equal of Mr. Everett's\r\noration, that yielded a large sum of money, that the orator applied to\r\nthe purchase of Mount Vernon.  Mr. Bancroft aimed to illustrate his\r\nhistory by an exhibition of philosophy.  This feat in literature can\r\nbe accomplished successfully only by a great mind.  First the events,\r\nthen the reasons for or sources of, then the consequences, then the\r\nwisdom or unwisdom of the human agencies that have had part in weaving\r\nthe web, are all to be considered.  Examples are Gibbon and Buckle.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT AS A MAN AND A FRIEND\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of General Grant's nature, his frankness in all his\r\nintercourse with his fellow men, his freedom from duplicity were not\r\ntouched unfavorably in any degree by his rapid advancement from the\r\nordinary pursuits of ordinary men to the highest places in military\r\nand civil life.  There was never in his career any ostentatious display\r\nof power, never any exercise of wanton or unnecessary authority.\r\n\r\nHe disliked controversy even in conversation, and his reticence when\r\nnot in the company of habitual companions and trusted friends was due\r\nin part to his rule of life on this subject.\r\n\r\nFrom the many years of my acquaintance with General Grant I cannot\r\nrecall an instance of a reference to theological opinions upon\r\ncontroverted topics of faith.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian side of his nature was strong, but it was not\r\nostentatiously exhibited--indeed it was concealed rather than\r\nproclaimed.  It was made known to me by his interest and by his lack of\r\ninterest in appointments in the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nOf salaried places he controlled the appointment of General Pleasanton\r\nas commissioner of internal revenue, and of that only.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions he suggested the designation of a person named for\r\nemployment in some menial and non-salaried service.  The person named\r\nwas in every instance the widow or daughter of some soldier of the war.\r\nAt intervals, not widely separated, he would bring the subject to my\r\nnotice.  Thus, without a command, I was forced to follow his suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe purity of his conversation might have been a worthy example for the\r\nmost carefully trained person in etiquette and morals.  My intercourse\r\nwith General Grant was intimate through many years, and never on any\r\noccasion did he repeat a story or a phrase that contained a profane\r\nremark or carried a vulgar allusion.  He had a relish for untainted wit\r\nand for genial humor, and for humor he had some capacity.  He was not\r\nan admirer of Mr. Sumner and a trace of irony may be found in a remark\r\nattributed to him:  When some one said:  \"Mr. Sumner does not believe\r\nin the Bible,\" General Grant said:  \"No, I suppose not, he didn't write\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was attracted by a horse driven by a butcher.  He\r\npurchased the animal at the cost of five hundred dollars.  He invited\r\nSenator Conkling to a drive behind the new horse.  The Senator\r\ncriticised the animal, and said:  \"I think I should prefer the five\r\nhundred dollars to the horse.\"  \"That is what the butcher thought,\"\r\nsaid General Grant.\r\n\r\nHe was sincere and devoted in his friendships, but when he discovered\r\nthat his confidence had been misplaced, a reconciliation became\r\nimpossible.  With him there could be no genuine forgiveness, and his\r\nnature could not tolerate any degree of hypocrisy.  All voluntary\r\nintercourse on his part had come to an end.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when a demand for my removal from office was made by\r\nsome Republican Senators and by the New York _Herald_, to which he gave\r\nno attention.\r\n\r\nThe imperturbability of spirit which was indicated in his conversation\r\nand movements was deep-seated in his nature.  I was with him in a\r\nnight trip to New York; when the train was derailed in part.  As the\r\nwheels of the car struck the sleepers, he grasped the back of the seat\r\nin front of him and remained motionless, while many of the passengers\r\nadded to their peril by abandoning their seats.\r\n\r\nOn a time General Grant received a pair of large roan horses from his\r\nfarm in Missouri.  He invited me to take one of the horses and join him\r\nin a ride on the saddle.  I declined the invitation.  I was then invited\r\nto take a seat with him in an open wagon.  When we were descending a\r\nslight declivity one of the horses laid his weight on the pole and\r\nbroke it, although the parts did not separate.  General Grant placed\r\nhis foot upon the wheel, thus making a brake and saving us from a\r\ndisaster.  General Grant's faculties were at command on the instant\r\nand under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ku Klux organizations were active in the South, the President\r\ngave members of Congress to understand that he would send a message\r\nwith a recommendation for punitive legislation.  Upon reflection he\r\ncame to doubt the wisdom of the measure, especially as the use of the\r\nmilitary forces at New Orleans and elsewhere had been criticised in the\r\ncountry.  While the subject was thus undisposed of, I received a\r\nmessage from the President which ended with a request that I should\r\naccompany him to the Capitol.  On the way he informed me that he\r\ndoubted the wisdom of a message and that he intended to so inform those\r\nto whom he had given encouragement.  At the interview which followed\r\nseveral members who were present urged adherence to the original policy.\r\nWhile the discussion was going on, the President returned to his\r\noriginal opinion and wrote a message which was transmitted to the\r\nCongress after one or two verbal changes that may have been suggested by\r\nSecretary Fish or Secretary Robeson.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's sense of justice was exact and he did not spare himself\r\nin his criticism.  He said to me in conversation, what is indicated in\r\nhis Memoirs, that he assumed some responsibility upon himself for the\r\nremoval of General Warren at Five Forks.  He had known that General\r\nWarren was disqualified by natural defects from command in the field,\r\nand hence that it was an error on his part that he had not assigned\r\nWarren to duty at a station.\r\n\r\nAgain he said to me that his final campaign against Vicksburg was the\r\nonly one of his campaigns that he could not criticise adversely when\r\ntested by reflection and experience.\r\n\r\nDuring my term of service an appointment of some importance was made by\r\nthe collector of New York.  The appointment was approved by me.  In the\r\nmeantime some opponents of the appointee approached the President.  Upon\r\nhis suggestion the appointment was suspended.  After a delay I received\r\na letter from the President dated June 28th, 1869, in which he says:\r\n\"If it should still be the pleasure of Mr. Grinnell to confer the\r\nappointment before tendered, let it be so, so far as I am concerned.\r\nI am not willing knowingly to do anyone injustice as I now am led to\r\nbelieve I may have done in the case of General Egan.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1884, there were paragraphs in the newspapers\r\nwhich justified the apprehension that General Grant was suffering from\r\na cancer.  In the late days of the month, I called upon him at his\r\nhouse in New York.  He was then in good health, apparently.  I found\r\nhim in his library engaged in the preparation of articles for the\r\n_Century Magazine_.  In the days of our more intimate acquaintance he\r\nhad said to me that it was his purpose to leave the history of his\r\ncampaigns to others.  He referred to that remark and said that his\r\nfinancial embarrassments had forced him to change his purpose.  As I\r\nwas about to leave, he referred to a difficulty in his throat that he\r\nhad noticed for about six months.  He expressed the fear that he had\r\nneglected it too long.  I avoided any serious remark in reply.  Soon\r\nafter my return to Groton my daughter received a letter from him, which,\r\nin photographic copy, I here give.  It contains his parting words to\r\nme and my family.  It is a precious souvenir of my acquaintance and\r\nservice with a man who was great and good above any estimate that the\r\nworld has placed upon him.\r\n\r\nI called upon him in the month of June.  He rose to receive me.  His\r\npower of speech was much impaired, and our interview was brief.  The\r\nfinal parting was a sad event to me.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\nNew York City,\r\nJanuary 3d, 1884;\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Boutwell:\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your New Year welcome, just received.  There is no\r\nfamily that I have ever known whose friendship I prize more highly than\r\nthat of your father.  I wish for him and his family many returns of\r\nnew years, and that all of them may find him and his in the enjoyment\r\nof good health and peace of mind.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nU. S. Grant\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT AS A SOLDIER*\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant came before the public, and into a position that\r\ncompelled notice, he was called to meet a difficulty that his\r\npredecessor in the office of President had encountered and overcome\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nAn opinion existed in the cultivated classes, an opinion that was\r\nespecially local in the East, that a great place could not be filled\r\nwisely and honorably, unless the occupant had had the benefit of a\r\nuniversity training.\r\n\r\nOf such training Mr. Lincoln was destitute, utterly, and the training\r\nwhich General Grant had received at West Point, where it was his\r\nfortune to attain only to advanced standing in the lower half of his\r\nclass, was at the best the training thought to be necessary for the\r\nvocation of a soldier.  That minority of critics overlooked the fact\r\nthat the world had set the seal of its favorable judgment upon\r\nCromwell, Washington, Franklin, Napoleon, Hamilton and others who had\r\nnot the advantages of university training.  Napoleon in a military\r\nschool and Hamilton in Columbia College for the term of a year, more\r\nor less, did not rank among university men.\r\n\r\nThat minority of critics did not realize the fact that colleges and\r\nuniversities cannot make great men.  Great men are independent of\r\ncolleges and universities.  In truth, a really great man is supreme\r\nover college and universities.\r\n\r\nLincoln was such a man in speech, in power of argument, in practical\r\nwisdom, by which he was enabled to act fearlessly and with success in\r\nthe great affairs of administration.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was General Grant on the military side of his career.  With\r\ngreat military capacity, he was destitute of the military spirit.\r\nDuring the period of his retirement from the army after the close of\r\nthe Mexican War he gave no attention to military affairs.  When he came\r\nto Washington in 1865 as General of the Army, he was not the owner of a\r\nwork on war nor on the military art or science.\r\n\r\nHis military capacity was an endowment.  It might have been impaired or\r\ncrippled by the training of a university; but it is doubtful whether it\r\ncould have been improved thereby, and it is certain that it was, in\r\nits quality, quite outside of the possibilities of university training.\r\n\r\nAs General Grant approached the end of his career the voice of the\r\ncritics, who judged men by the testimony of college catalogues and the\r\ndecorations of learned societies, was heard less frequently; and his\r\ndeath, followed by the publication of his memoirs, written when the\r\nhand of death was upon him, silenced the literary critics at once and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nSince the month of July, 1885, there has appeared on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic a set of military critics, of whom General Wolseley,\r\nCommander of the British Army, must be treated as the chief, who deny\r\nto General Grant the possession of superior military qualities, and who\r\nassert that General Lee was his superior in the contest which they\r\ncarried on from February, 1864, to April, 1865.  On this side of the\r\nAtlantic there is toleration, if not active and open support of General\r\nWolseley's opinion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wolseley is entitled to an opinion and to the expression of his\r\nopinion; but his authority cannot be admitted.  On the practical side\r\nof military affairs his experience is a limited experience only.\r\n\r\nIt is not known that General Wolseley ever, in any capacity, engaged in\r\nany battle that can be named in comparison with the battles of the\r\nWilderness, with Spottsylvania, with Cold Harbor, or the battle of Five\r\nForks; and it is certain that it was never his fortune to put one\r\nhundred thousand men, or even fifty thousand men, into the wage of\r\nbattle and thus assume the responsibility of the contest.\r\n\r\nIt was never the necessity of the situation that General Lee should\r\nassume the offensive, and in the two instances where he did assume the\r\noffensive his campaigns were failures; and can any one doubt that if\r\nGeneral Grant had been in command either at Antietam or Gettysburg, the\r\nwar would than have come to an end of the left bank of the Potomac\r\nRiver by the capture of Lee's army?  If this be so, then Lee's\r\nundertaking was a hazard for which there could have been no justifying\r\nreason, and his escape from destruction was due to the inadequacy of the\r\nmen in command of the Northern armies.  Following this remark I ought to\r\nsay that General Meade was a brave and patriotic officer, but he lacked\r\nthe qualities which enable a man to act promptly and wisely in great\r\nexigencies.  While General Lee was acting on the defensive did he\r\nengage in and successfully execute any strategic movement that can be\r\ncompared with Grant's campaign of May, 1863, through Mississippi and to\r\nthe rear of Vicksburg?  Or can General Wolseley cite an instance of\r\nindividual genius and power more conspicuous than the relief of our\r\nbesieged army at Chattanooga, the capture of six thousand prisoners,\r\nforty pieces of artillery, seven thousand stands of small arms and\r\nlarge quantities of other material of war?\r\n\r\nDuring the period of reconstruction Alexander H. Stephens was examined\r\nby the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives as to\r\nthe condition and purposes of the South.  When the examination was over\r\nI asked him when he came to the conclusion that the South was to be\r\ndefeated.  He said:  \"In the year 1862.\"  I then said:  \"In that year\r\nyou had your successes.  What were the grounds of your conclusions?\"\r\nIn reply he said:  \"It was then that I first realized that the North\r\nwas putting its whole force into the contest, and I knew that in such\r\na contest we were to be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were to imagine a reason, or to suggest an excuse for General Lee's\r\ntwo unsuccessful aggressive campaigns, I should assume that,\r\nsimultaneously with Mr. Stephens, he had reached the conclusion that\r\ntime was on the side of the North, and that the Fabian policy must fail\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\nIn an aggressive movement there was one chance of success.  A victory\r\nand capture of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington might lead to an\r\narrangement by which the Confederacy would be recognized, or a\r\nrestoration of the Union secured upon a basis acceptable to the South.\r\nA desperate undertaking, no doubt, but it is difficult to suggest a\r\nmore adequate reason for the conduct of General Lee.\r\n\r\nI cannot, as a civilian, assume to give a judgment which shall be\r\naccepted by any one, upon the relative standing of military men; but I\r\ncannot accept, without question, the decision of a military man who\r\nnever won a great victory in a great battle, upon a chieftain who\r\nfought many great battles and never lost one.\r\n\r\nI end my observations upon General Grant as a soldier by the relation\r\nof an incident in my acquaintance with General Sherman, which was\r\nintimate during the four years that I was at the head of the Treasury\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nIt was my custom in those years to spend evenings at General Sherman's,\r\nwhere we indulged ourselves in conversation and in the enjoyment of the\r\ngame of billiards.  Our conversations were chiefly upon the war.  In\r\nthose conversations General Grant's name and doings were the topics\r\noften.  General Sherman never instituted a comparison between General\r\nGrant and any one else, nor did he ever express an opinion of General\r\nGrant as a military leader; but his conversation always assumed that\r\nGeneral Grant was superior to every other officer, himself, General\r\nSherman, included.\r\n\r\nIn concurrence with the opinion of General Sherman the friends of\r\nGeneral Grant may call an array of witnesses who, both from numbers and\r\ncharacter, are entitled to large confidence.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years of the Civil War more than two million men served\r\nin the Northern Army.  Many of them, more than a majority of them,\r\nprobably, served for at least three years each.  With an unanimity that\r\nwas never disturbed by an audible voice of dissent, the two million\r\nveterans gave to General Grant supremacy over all the other officers\r\nunder whom they had served.  With like unanimity the chief officers of\r\nthe army assigned the first place to General Grant, and never in any\r\nother war of modern times has there been equal opportunity for the\r\napplications of a satisfactory test to leaders.  In all the wars which\r\nEngland has been engaged since the fall of Napoleon, except, possibly,\r\nthe Crimean War, the opposing forces have been composed of inferior\r\nraces of men.  The fields of contest have been in India, Egypt and South\r\nAfrica.  From such contests no satisfactory opinion can be formed as to\r\nthe qualities of the leaders of the victorious forces.\r\n\r\nIn our Civil War the men and the officers were of the same race in the\r\nmain, and the educated officers had been alike trained at West Point.\r\nExcept in numbers, the armies of the North and the South were upon an\r\nequality, and in all the great contests, the numbers engaged were\r\nequal substantially.  The quality of the man and officers may be gauged\r\nand measured with accuracy from the fact that at Shiloh, in the\r\nWilderness and at Gettysburg the same fields were contested for two\r\nand three continuous days.  It has been said of Mr. Adams that when an\r\nEnglish sympathizer with the South lauded the bravery of the Southern\r\nArmy, Mr. Adams replied:  \"Yes, they are brave men; they are my country-\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern Army was composed of brave men and its officers were\r\nqualified by training and experience to command any army and to contest\r\nfor supremacy on any field.\r\n\r\nMy readers should not assume that I have avoided a discussion of the\r\ncharacteristics of General Grant in his personality and as a civil\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nThe voice of those who in 1872 denied his ability and questioned his\r\nintegrity is no longer heard; but there are those at home and abroad\r\nwho either teach or accept the notion that General Grant has become\r\ngreat historically by having been the favorite of fortune.\r\n\r\n[* From the New York _Independent_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\nBLAINE AND CONKLING AND THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1880\r\n\r\nThe controversy between Mr. Blaine and Mr. Conkling on the floor of the\r\nHouse of Representatives in the Thirty-ninth Congress was fraught with\r\nserious consequences to the contestants, and it may have changed the\r\nfortunes of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling was a member of the Thirty-seventh Congress, but he was\r\ndefeated as a candidate for the Thirty-eighth.  He was returned for the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress.  During the term of the Thirty-eighth Congress\r\nhe was commissioned by the Department of War as judge-advocate, and\r\nassigned for duty to the prosecution of Major Haddock and the trial of\r\ncertain soldiers known as \"bounty jumpers.\"  That duty he performed.\r\n\r\nWhen the army bill was before the House in April, 1866, Mr. Conkling\r\nmoved to strike out the section which made an appropriation for the\r\nsupport of the provost-marshal general.  General Grant, then in\r\ncommand of the army, had given an opinion, in a letter dated March 19,\r\n1866, that that office in the War Department was an unnecessary office.\r\nMr. Conkling supported his motion in a speech in which he said:  \"My\r\nobjection to this section is that is creates an unnecessary office for\r\nan undeserving public servant; it fastens, as an incubus upon the\r\ncountry, a hateful instrument of war, which deserves no place in a free\r\ngovernment in a time of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Conkling not only assailed the office, he assailed the officer,\r\nand in a manner calculated to kindle resentment, especially in an\r\nofficer of high rank.  General James B. Fry was provost-marshal-general.\r\nHe was able to command the friendship of Mr. Blaine, and on the\r\nthirtieth day of April, Mr. Blaine read from his seat in the House a\r\nletter from General Fry addressed to himself.  Thus Mr. Blaine endorsed\r\nthe contents of the letter.\r\n\r\nIn that letter General Fry made three specific charges against Mr.\r\nConkling, but he made no answer to the arraignment that Mr. Conkling\r\nhad made of him and his office.  Thus he avoided the issue that Mr.\r\nConkling had raised.  His charges were these:\r\n\r\n1.  That Mr. Conkling had received a fee for the prosecution of Major\r\nHaddock, and that the same had been received improperly, if not\r\nillegally.\r\n\r\n2.  That in the discharge of his duties he had not acted in good faith,\r\nand that he had been zealous in preventing the prosecution of deserters\r\nat Utica.\r\n\r\n3.  That he had notified the War Department that the Provost-Marshal in\r\nWestern New York needed legal advice, and that thereupon he received\r\nan appointment.\r\n\r\nThe fourth charge was an inference, and it fell with the allegation.\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of the letter a debate arose which fell below any\r\nrecognized standard of Congressional controversy and which rendered a\r\nreconciliation impossible.\r\n\r\nAt that time my relations to Mr. Conkling were not intimate, and I am\r\nnow puzzled when I ask myself the question:  \"Why did Mr. Conkling\r\ninvite my opinion as to his further action in the matter?\"  That he did,\r\nhowever; and I advised him to ask for a committee.  A committee of five\r\nwas appointed, three Republicans and two Democrats.  Mr. Shellabarger\r\nwas chairman, and Mr. Windom was a member.\r\n\r\nThe report was a unanimous report.  The committee criticised the\r\npractice of reading letters in the House, which reflected upon the\r\nHouse, or upon the acts or speeches of any member.\r\n\r\nAt considerable length of statement and remarks, the committee\r\nexonerated Mr. Conkling from each and every one of the charges, and,\r\nwith emphasis, the proceedings on the part of General Fry were\r\ncondemned.  The most important of the resolutions reported by the\r\ncommittee was in these words:\r\n\r\n_Resolved,_ That all the statements contained in the letter of General\r\nJames B. Fry to Hon. James G. Blaine, a member of this House, bearing\r\ndate the 27th of April, A. D. 1866, and which was read in this House\r\nthe 30th day of April, A. D. 1866, in so far as such statements impute\r\nto the Hon. Roscoe Conkling, a member of this House, any criminal,\r\nillegal, unpatriotic, or otherwise improper conduct, or motives, either\r\nas to the matter of his procuring himself to be employed by the\r\nGovernment of the United States in the prosecution of military offences\r\nin the State of New York, in the management of such prosecutions, in\r\ntaking compensation therefor, or in any other charge, are wholly without\r\nfoundation truth, and for their publication there were, in the judgment\r\nof the House, no facts connected with said prosecutions furnishing\r\neither a palliative or an excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe controversy thus opened came to an end only with Mr. Conkling's\r\ndeath.  It is not known to me that Mr. Conkling and Mr. Blaine were\r\nunfriendly previous to the encounter of April, 1866.  That they could\r\nhave lived on terms of intimacy, or even of ordinary friendship, is not\r\nprobable.  Yet it may not be easy to assign a reason for such an\r\nestrangement unless it may be found in the word incompatibility.  My\r\nrelations with Mr. Blaine were friendly, reserved, and as to his\r\naspirations for the Presidency, it was well understood by him that I\r\ncould not be counted among his original supporters.\r\n\r\nOnly on one occasion was the subject ever mentioned.  About two weeks\r\nbefore the Republican Convention of 1884, I met Mr. Blaine in Lafayette\r\nSquare.  He beckoned me to a seat on a bench.  He opened the\r\nconversation by saying that he was glad to have some votes in the\r\nconvention, but that he did not wish for the nomination.  He expressed\r\na wish to defeat the nomination of President Arthur, and he then said\r\nthe ticket should be General Sherman and Robert Lincoln.  Most\r\nassuredly the nomination of that ticket would have been followed by an\r\nelection.  To me General Sherman had one answer to the suggestion:\r\n\"I am not a statesman; my brother John is.  If any Sherman is to be\r\nnominated, he is the man.\"\r\n\r\nI did not then question, nor do I now question, the sincerity of the\r\nstatement that Mr. Blaine then made.  My acquaintance with Mr. Blaine\r\nbegan with our election to the Thirty-eighth Congress, and it continued\r\non terms of reserved friendship to the end of his life.  That reserve\r\nwas not due to any defect in his character of which I had knowledge,\r\nnor to the statements concerning him that were made by others, but to\r\nan opinion that he was not a person whose candidacy I was willing to\r\nespouse in advance of his nomination.  I ought to say that in my\r\nintercourse with Mr. Blaine he was frank and free from dissimulation.\r\n\r\nI was on terms of intimacy with Mr. Conkling from the disastrous April,\r\n1866, to the end of his life.  Hence it was that I ventured upon an\r\nexperiment which a less well-assured friend would have avoided.  I\r\nassumed that Mr. Blaine would close the controversy at the first\r\nopportunity.  It may be said of Mr. Blaine that, while he had great\r\nfacility for getting into difficulties, he had also a strong desire to\r\nget out of difficulties, and great capacity for the accomplishment of\r\nhis purposes in that direction.\r\n\r\nOn a time, and years previous to 1880, I put the matter before Mr.\r\nConkling, briefly, upon personal grounds, and upon public grounds in\r\na party sense.  He received the suggestion without any manifestation\r\nof feeling, and with great candor he said:  \"That attack was made\r\nwithout any provocation by me as against Mr. Blaine, and when I was\r\nsuffering more from other causes than I ever suffered at any other time,\r\nand I shall never overlook it.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's strength was so overmastering in 1868 and 1872 that\r\nthe controversy between Blaine and Conkling was of no importance to the\r\nRepublican Party.  The disappearance of the political influence of\r\nGeneral Grant in 1876 revived the controversy within the Republican\r\nParty, and made the nomination of either Blaine or Conkling an\r\nimpossibility.  Its evil influence extended to the election, and it put\r\nin jeopardy the success of General Hayes.  At the end, Mr. Conkling\r\ndid not accept the judgment of the Electoral Commission as a just\r\njudgment, and he declined to vote for its affirmation.\r\n\r\nI urged Mr. Conkling to sustain the action of the commission, and upon\r\nthe ground that we had taken full responsibility when we agreed to the\r\nreference and that there was then no alternative open to us.  I did not\r\nattempt to solve the problem of the election of 1876 either upon ethical\r\nor political grounds.  The evidence was more conclusive than\r\nsatisfactory that there had been wrong-doing in New York, in Oregon,\r\nin New Orleans, and not unlikely in many other places.  As a measure of\r\npeace, when ascertained justice had become an impossibility, I was\r\nready to accept the report of the commission, whether it gave the\r\nPresidency to General Hayes or to Mr. Tilden.  The circumstances were\r\nsuch that success before the commission did not promise any\r\nadvantage to the successful party.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I pass by the Convention of 1880 and the events of the\r\nfollowing year.  In the year 1884 Mr. Conkling was in the practice of\r\nhis profession and enjoying therefrom larger emoluments, through a\r\nseries of years, than ever were enjoyed by any other member of the\r\nAmerican bar.  He once said to me:  \"My father would denounce me if\r\nhe knew what charges I am making.\"  That conjecture may have been well\r\nfounded, for the father would not have been the outcome of the period\r\nin which the son was living.  The father was an austere county judge,\r\nlargely destitute of the rich equipment for the profession for which\r\nthe son was distinguished.  After the year 1881, when Mr. Conkling\r\ngave himself wholly to the profession, Mr. Justice Miller made this\r\nremark to me:  \"For the discussion of the law and the facts of a case\r\nMr. Conkling is the best lawyer who comes into our court.\"\r\n\r\nIf this estimate was trustworthy, then Mr. Conkling's misgivings as to\r\nhis charges may have been groundless.  If a rich man, whose property is\r\nput in peril, whose liberty is assailed, or whose reputation is\r\nthreatened, will seek the advice and aid of the leading advocate of the\r\ncity, state, or country, shall not the compensation be commensurate\r\nwith the stake that has been set up?  Is it to be measured by the\r\n_per diem_ time pay of ordinary men?\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Mr. Conkling's pecuniary interests or\r\nprofessional engagements in the year 1884, he found time to take a quiet\r\npart in the contest of that year, and to contribute to Mr. Blaine's\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, and after the election, I had occasion to pass\r\na Sunday in New York.  It happened, and by accident, that I met Mr.\r\nConkling on Fifth Avenue.  After the formalities, he invited me to call\r\nwith him upon Mr. William K. Vanderbilt.  Mr. Vanderbilt was absent\r\nwhen we called.  Upon his return, the election was the topic of\r\nconversation.  Mr. Vanderbilt said that he voted for Garfield in 1880,\r\nbut that he had not voted for Blaine.  Mr. Conkling expressed his\r\nregret that Mr. Blaine had come so near a success, and he attributed it\r\nto the fact that he had not anticipated the support which had been\r\ngiven to Blaine by the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nOn a time in the conversation Mr. Conkling said:  \"Mr. Vanderbilt, why\r\ndid you sell Maud S.?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Vanderbilt proceeded to give reasons.  He had received letters from\r\nstrangers inquiring about her pedigree, care, age, treatment, etc.,\r\nwhich he could not answer without more labor than he was willing to\r\nperform.  As a final reason, he said:  \"When I drive up Broadway, people\r\ndo not say, 'There goes Vanderbilt,' but they say, 'There goes Maud S.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant was on his journey around the world I wrote him a\r\nletter occasionally, and occasionally I received a letter in reply.  In\r\ntwo of my letters I mentioned as a fact what I then thought to be the\r\ntruth, that there was a very considerable public opinion in favor of\r\nhis nomination for President in 1880, and that upon his return to the\r\ncountry some definite action on his part might be required.  Upon a\r\nrecent examination of his letters, I find that they are free from any\r\nreference to the Presidency.  If Mr. Conkling, General Logan, Mr.\r\nCameron, and myself came to be considered the special representatives\r\nof General Grant at the Chicago Convention of 1880, the circumstance was\r\nnot due to any designation by him prior to the Galena letter, of which\r\nI am to speak and which was written while the convention was in session,\r\nand when the contest between the contending parties was far advanced.\r\n\r\nOur title was derived from the constant support that we had given him\r\nthrough many years and from his constant friendship for us through the\r\nsame many years.  We were of the opinion then, and in that belief we\r\nnever faltered, that the nomination and election of General Grant were\r\nthe best security that could be had for the peace and prosperity of\r\nthe country.  That opinion was supported by an expressed public\r\nsentiment in the conventions of New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois,\r\nand in other parts of the country there were evidences of a disposition\r\nin the body of the people to support General Grant in numbers far in\r\nexcess of the strength of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the people were not disturbed by the thought that General\r\nGrant might become President a third time.  They did not accept the\r\nabsurd notion that experience, successful experience, disqualified a\r\nman for further service.  Nor did that apprehension influence any\r\nconsiderable number of the leaders.  They demanded a transfer of power\r\ninto new hands.  This, unquestionably, was their right, and as a\r\nmajority of the convention, as the convention was constituted finally,\r\nthey were able to assert and to maintain their supremacy.\r\n\r\nIt is too late for complaints, and complaints were vain when the causes\r\nwere transpiring, but there were delegates who appeared in the\r\nconvention as opponents of General Grant who had been elected upon the\r\nunderstanding that they were his friends.  Upon this fact I hang a\r\nsingle observation.  If there is a trust in human affairs that should be\r\ntreated as a sacred trust it is to be found in the duty that arises\r\nfrom the acceptance of a representative office in matters of government.\r\nWhen a public opinion has been formed, either in regard to men or to\r\nmeasures, whoever undertakes to represent that opinion should do so in\r\ngood faith.\r\n\r\nTo this rule there were many exceptions in the Republican Convention of\r\n1880, and it was no slight evidence of devotion to the party and to the\r\ncountry when General Grant and Mr. Conkling entered actively into the\r\ncontest after the fortunes of the party had been prostrated, apparently,\r\nby the disaster in the State of Maine.\r\n\r\nOf the many incidents of the convention no one is more worthy of notice\r\nthan the speech of Mr. Conkling when he placed General Grant in\r\nnomination.  Whatever he said that was in support of his cause,\r\naffirmatively, was of the highest order of dramatic eloquence.  When he\r\ndealt with his opponents, his speech was not advanced in quality and its\r\ninfluence was diminished.  His reference in his opening sentence to his\r\nassociates who had deserted General Grant:  \"In obedience to\r\ninstructions which I should never dare to disregard,\" was tolerated even\r\nby his enemies; but his allusion to Mr. Blaine in these words:  \"without\r\npatronage, without emissaries, without committees, without bureaus,\r\nwithout telegraph wires running from his house to this convention, or\r\nrunning from his house anywhere,\" intensified the opposition to General\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\nIn many particulars his speech is an unequaled analysis of General\r\nGrant's character and career, presented in a most attractive form.  An\r\nextract may be tolerated from a speech that can be read with interest\r\neven by those who are ignorant of the doings, or it may be, by those\r\nwho have no knowledge of the existence, of the convention:\r\n\r\n\"Standing on the highest eminence of human distinction, modest, firm,\r\nsimple, and self-poised, having filled all lands with his renown, he\r\nhas seen not only the high-born and the titled, but the poor and the\r\nlowly, in the uttermost ends of the earth, rise and uncover before him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling was the recognized leader of the three hundred and six who\r\nconstituted the compact body of the supporters of General Grant.\r\n\r\nSuggestions were made that the substitution of Mr. Conkling's name for\r\nGeneral Grant's name would give the nomination to Mr. Conkling, and\r\nthere was a moment of time when General Garfield anticipated or\r\napprehended such a result.  There was, however, never a moment of time\r\nwhen such a result was possible.  The three hundred and six would never\r\nhave consented to the use of any name in place of General Grant's name\r\nunless General Grant's name were first withdrawn by his authority.\r\n\r\nA firmer obstacle even would have been found in Mr. Conkling's sturdy\r\nrefusal to allow the use of his name under such circumstances.  Among\r\nthe friends of General Grant the thought of such a proceeding was never\r\nentertained, although the suggestion was made, but without authority,\r\nprobably, from those charged with the management of the organizations\r\nengaged in the struggle.\r\n\r\nAfter many years had passed, and the proceedings of the convention were\r\nwell-nigh forgotten, Mr. John Russell Young printed a letter in which he\r\nmade the charge that Conkling, Cameron, Boutwell, and Lincoln had\r\nconcealed the contents of a letter from General Grant in which he\r\ndirected them as his representatives to withdraw his name from the\r\nconvention.  Mr. Young was in error in two particulars.  Lincoln was not\r\nnamed in the letter.  General Logan was the fourth person to whom the\r\nletter was addressed.\r\n\r\nYoung brought the letter from Galena, where Grant then was, and he\r\nclaims that the letter was addressed to himself.  General Frederick D.\r\nGrant, who was then at Chicago, claims that the letter was addressed to\r\nhim, and that, after reading it, he handed it to Mr. Conkling.\r\n\r\nAs late as the first half of the year 1897, Mr. Conkling's papers had\r\nnot been examined carefully.  The contents of the letter are important,\r\nand for the present the evidence is circumstantial; but to me it is\r\nconclusive against Mr. Young's statement that Conkling, Cameron, Logan,\r\nand Boutwell were directed by General Grant to withdraw his name from\r\nthe convention.  I cannot now say that I read the letter, but of its\r\nreceipt and the contents I had full knowledge, and I referred to it\r\nin these words in a letter to my daughter dated May 31, 1880:\r\n\r\n\"Grant sent for Young to visit him at Galena.  Young returned to-day,\r\nand says that Grant directed him to say to Cameron, Logan, Conkling,\r\nand Boutwell that he should be satisfied with whatever they may do.\"\r\n\r\nWithout any special recollection upon the point, the conclusion of\r\nreason is that my letter was written from a conversation with Young,\r\nand before I had knowledge of the contents of Grant's letter.  I may\r\nadd, however, that his letter produced no change in my opinion as to\r\nour authority and duty in regard to Grant's candidacy.  My mind never\r\ndeparted for a moment from the idea that we were free, entirely free,\r\nto continue the contest in behalf of General Grant upon our own judgment.\r\n\r\nUpon the views and facts already presented and with even greater\r\ncertainty upon the correspondence with General Frederick D. Grant,\r\nI submit as the necessary conclusion of the whole matter that the letter\r\nof General Grant of May, 1880, did not contain any specific\r\ninstructions, and especially that it did not contain instructions for\r\nthe withdrawal of his name from the convention; in fine, that the\r\nfurther conduct of the contest was left to the discretion and judgment\r\nof the four men whom he had recognized as his representatives.\r\n\r\nI annex the correspondence with General Frederick D. Grant:\r\n\r\nBOSTON, MASS., _May_ 28, 1897.\r\nCOL. FRED. D. GRANT, NEW YORK, N. Y.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_  You will of course recall the fact that John Russell Young,\r\nsome months ago, made a public statement in which he declared that he\r\nbrought from Galena to Chicago, during the session of the Republican\r\nConvention of 1880, a letter from General Grant in which he gave\r\nspecific directions to Conkling, Cameron, and Boutwell to withdraw his\r\nname as a candidate from the convention.  Some months ago I had some\r\ncorrespondence with A. R. Conkling, and also with yourself, in regard\r\nto the contents of the letter written by General Grant.  Mr. A. R.\r\nConkling sent me a copy of a portion of a letter which, as he advised\r\nme, he had received from you.  A copy of that extract I herewith\r\nenclose.  As one of the friends of General Grant and as one of the\r\npersons to whom bad faith was imputed by Mr. Young, it is my purpose to\r\nplace the matter before the public with such evidence as I can\r\ncommand, for the purpose of showing the character of the letter.\r\n\r\nI wish to obtain from you such a statement as you are willing to make,\r\nwith the understanding that whenever the case shall be presented to the\r\npublic your letter may be used.\r\n\r\nAside from actual evidence tending to show that Young's statement is\r\nerroneous, I cannot believe that General Grant would have recognized\r\nas a friend either one of the persons named, if his explicit\r\ninstructions for the withdrawal of his name had been made by him and\r\ndisregarded by them.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n  GEO S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n25 EAST 62D STREET,\r\nNEW YORK, _May_ 30, 1897.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Senator:_  I received yesterday your letter of May 28th, in\r\nwhich you asked me what I remember about a letter which my father,\r\nGeneral Grant, wrote to his four leading friends during the session of\r\nthe Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1880.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this matter my recollection is, that Mr. John Russell\r\nYoung, who had been visiting father in Galena, brought from him a\r\nlarge sealed envelope, which he delivered to me at my home in Chicago,\r\nwith directions from my father that I should read the letter contained\r\ntherein, and then see that it was received safely by his four friends,\r\nSenators Conkling, Boutwell, Cameron, and Logan.\r\n\r\nThe substance of General Grant's letter was, that the personal feelings\r\nof partisans of the leading candidates had grown to be so bitter, that\r\nit might become advisable for the good of the Republican Party to\r\nselect as their candidate some one whose name had not yet been\r\nprominently before the convention, and that he therefore wrote to say\r\nto those who represented his interest in the convention, that it would\r\nbe quite satisfactory to him if they would confer with those who\r\nrepresented the interests of Mr. Blaine and decided to have both his\r\nname and Mr. Blaine's withdrawn from before the convention.\r\n\r\nI delivered in person this letter from my father, to Senator Conkling--\r\nI do not know what disposition he made of it.\r\n\r\nWith highest regards, my dear Senator, for your family and yourself,\r\nbelieve me, as ever,\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\nFREDERICK D. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the visit of General Grant and Mr. Conkling to Mentor in the\r\nautumn of 1880, I was informed by Mr. Conkling that he had not been\r\nalone one minute with General Garfield, intending by that care-taking\r\nto avoid the suggestion that his visit was designed to afford an\r\nopportunity for any personal or party arrangement.  Further, it was the\r\nwish of General Grant, as it was his wish, that the effort which they\r\nwere then making should be treated as a service due to the party and to\r\nthe country, and that General Garfield should be left free from any\r\nobligation to them whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAfter the election and after Mr. Blaine became Secretary of State, he\r\nvolunteered to speak of the situation of the party in New York and of\r\nMr. Conkling's standing in the State.  Among other things, he said that\r\nMr. Conkling was the only man who had had three elections to the Senate,\r\nand that Mr. Conkling and his friends would be considered fairly in\r\nthe appointments that might be made in that State.\r\n\r\nWhen in a conversation with Conkling, I mentioned Blaine's remark, he\r\nsaid, \"Do you believe one word of that?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Yes, I believe Mr. Blaine.\"\r\n\r\nHe said with emphasis, \"I don't.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent events strengthened Mr. Conkling in his opinion, but those\r\nevents did not change my opinion of Mr. Blaine's integrity of purpose\r\nin the conversations of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the events, not important in themselves, but which\r\nseem to have the relation of a prelude to the great tragedy, was\r\nderived from three persons, Mr. Conkling, Mr. Blaine, and Mr. Marshall\r\nJewell.  At the request of the President, Mr. Conkling called upon him\r\nthe Sunday preceding the day of catastrophe.  The President gave Mr.\r\nConkling the names of persons that he was considering favorably for\r\ncertain places.  To several of these Mr. Conkling made objections, and\r\nin some cases other persons were named.  As Mr. Conkling was leaving\r\nhe said, \"Mr. President, what do you propose about the collectorship\r\nof New York?\"  The President said, \"We will leave that for another\r\ntime.\"  These statements I received from Mr. Conkling.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Jewell I received the following statement as coming from the\r\nPresident:  When the New York nominations were sent to the Senate, the\r\nPresident was forthwith in the receipt of letters and despatches in\r\nprotest, coupled with the suggestion that everything had been\r\nsurrendered to Conkling.  Without delay and without consultation with\r\nany one, the President nominated Judge Robertson to the office of\r\ncollector of New York.  Further, the President said, as reported by Mr.\r\nJewell, Mr. Blaine heard of the nomination, and he came in very pale\r\nand much astonished.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Blaine I received the specific statement that he had no\r\nknowledge of the nomination of Judge Robertson until it had been made.\r\n\r\nThese statements are reconcilable with each other, and they place the\r\nresponsibility for the sudden and fatal rupture of the relations\r\nbetween Mr. Conkling and the President upon the President.  Mr. Conkling\r\ncould not fail to regard the nomination of Robertson as a wilful and\r\npremeditated violation of the pledge given at the Sunday conference.\r\nIt was, however, only an instance of General Garfield's impulsive and\r\nunreasoning submission to an expression of public opinion, without\r\nwaiting for evidence of the nature and value of that opinion.  That\r\nweakness had been observed by his associates in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and on that weakness his administration was wrecked.\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling was much misrepresented and of course he was much\r\nmisunderstood.  As a Senator from New York he claimed a right to be\r\nconsulted in regard to the principal appointments in the State.  His\r\nrecommendations were few and they were made with great care.  He\r\nconfined himself to the chief appointments.  It was quite difficult\r\nto secure his name or his favorable word in behalf of applicants for\r\nthe subordinate places.\r\n\r\nIn my experience with him, which was considerable in the Internal\r\nRevenue Office and in the Treasury, I found him ready to concede to\r\nthe opinions of the Executive Department.  He was one of those who\r\nheld to the opinion that it was the duty of Representatives and Senators\r\nto give advice in regard to appointments and to give it upon their\r\nresponsibility as members of the Government.  Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are not officers of the Government, they are members\r\nof the Government, and the duty of giving aid to the administration\r\nrests upon them.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is chosen to represent a State or a district, a presumption\r\nshould arise that he will act for the good of the country to the best\r\nof his ability.  Advice in regard to appointments is a part of his\r\nduty, and in the main the Senators and Representatives are worthy of\r\nconfidence.  The present Civil Service system rests upon the theory that\r\nthey are not to be trusted and that three men without a constituency\r\nare safer custodians of power.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Garfield and the accession of Arthur, Mr. Conkling\r\nlooked for one thing, and one thing only--the removal of Robertson.\r\nWhen this was not done he separated from Arthur.  I have no knowledge\r\nof the reasons which governed the President, but I think his career\r\nwould have been more agreeable to himself if he had so far vindicated\r\nhis own course and the course of his friends as to have removed from\r\noffice the man who had contributed so largely to the defeat of the wing\r\nof the Republican Party with which Mr. Arthur was identified.\r\n\r\nWhen General Garfield died, the Republican Party was broken, and it\r\nseemed to be without hope.  President Arthur's conciliatory policy did\r\nmuch to restore harmony of all the elements except the wing represented\r\nby Mr. Conkling.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that a better result might have been secured by\r\nthe early removal of Robertson.  That course of action would have been\r\nsatisfactory to Conkling, and given strength to the party in New York,\r\nwhere strength was most needed.  With Mr. Conkling's aid in 1884, Mr.\r\nArthur might have been nominated, and if nominated it is probable that\r\nhe might have been elected with Mr. Conkling's aid.  Arthur's error was\r\nthat he offended two important factions of the party.  By retaining\r\nRobertson he alienated Conkling, and by the removal of Blaine he\r\nalienated him and his friends.  Hence in 1884 two elements of the party\r\nthat were bitterly opposed to each other harmonized in their opposition\r\nto Arthur.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\nFROM 1875 TO 1895\r\n\r\nTHE HAWAIIAN TREATY AND RECIPROCITY\r\n\r\nIn January, 1875, Mr. Fish negotiated a treaty with the representatives\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands by which there was to be a free exchange of\r\nspecified products and manufactures.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth article the King agreed not to dispose of any port or\r\nharbor in his dominions or create a lien thereon in favor of any other\r\ngovernment.  When the treaty came to the Senate it had no original\r\nfriends, and it met with determined opposition, especially from Sherman\r\nof Ohio, and Morrill and Edmunds of Vermont.  The reciprocity feature\r\nannoyed them, they fearing that it might be used as a precedent for\r\nreciprocity with Canada.\r\n\r\nI was early impressed with the importance of securing a foothold in the\r\nislands and I considered the exclusion of other nations as a step in\r\nthe right direction.  The trustworthy estimates showed that the\r\nreciprocity feature would work a loss to the Treasury of the United\r\nStates of more than half a million dollars a year.  This the supporters\r\nof the treaty were compelled to admit, but after argument the requisite\r\nmajority ratified the treaty and upon the theory that the political,\r\nnaval and commercial advantages were an adequate compensation.  Upon the\r\nrenewal of the treaty the King ceded Pearl River Harbor to the United\r\nStates.  After the expiration of the fixed period of seven years during\r\nwhich the two nations were bound mutually, there was a class of men who\r\nwere anxious to abrogate the treaty, and at each session of Congress\r\nfor several years a proposition was introduced for that purpose.  By\r\nsomething of argument and something of art, the scheme was defeated.\r\nThe opposition, led usually by Holman, of Indiana, consisted largely of\r\nDemocrats.  Their reason was loss of revenue.  That fact was always\r\nadmitted by the friends of the treaty.  It was claimed also that there\r\nwas no advantage gained by the country from the introduction of rice\r\nand sugar from the islands duty-free.  It was asserted by the\r\ncombinations the prices were as high on the Pacific Coast as on the\r\nAtlantic.  On the other hand the Louisiana sugar planters opposed the\r\ntreaty on the ground that they were unfavorably affected.  As the\r\nimportations from the islands never exceeded four per cent of the\r\nconsumption of the country, the treaty had no perceptible effect upon\r\nprices.  The sugar and rice interests were reinforced by the delegations\r\nfrom Michigan, Ohio and Vermont, who opposed the treaty under an\r\napprehension that it would operate as a precedent for a revival of the\r\nsystem of reciprocity with Canada.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the annexation of Canada to the United States, whether the\r\nevent shall occur in a time near or be postponed to a time remote,\r\ndepends probably on our action upon the subject of reciprocity.\r\n\r\nCanada needs our markets and our facilities for ocean transportation,\r\nand, as long as these advantages are denied to her, she can never attain\r\nto a high degree of prosperity.  England may furnish capital for\r\nrailways, but railways are profitable only where there is business and\r\nproduction on the one hand, and markets on the other.  The system of\r\nqualified intercourse tends to make the Canadian farmer dissatisfied\r\nwith his condition, and as long as there are cheap lands in the United\r\nStates he will find relief in emigration.\r\n\r\nThe time, however, is not far distant, when the Canadian farmer will be\r\nunable to sell his lands in the Dominion and with the proceeds purchase\r\na home in the States.  When that time arrives he will favor annexation\r\nas a means of raising his own possessions to a value corresponding to\r\nthe value of land in the States.  The body of farmers, laborers, and\r\ntrading people will favor annexation, ultimately, should the policy of\r\nnon-intercourse be adhered to on our part, and they will outnumber the\r\noffice-holding class, and thus the union of the two countries will be\r\nsecured.  It is apparent also that a policy of free intercourse would\r\npostpone annexation for a long time, if not indefinitely.  Give to the\r\nCanadian farmer and fisherman free access to our markets and there will\r\nremain only a political motive in favor of annexation.  The English\r\ngovernment is pursuing a liberal policy in its dealings with the\r\nDominion, and there is no reason for anticipating a retrograde course\r\nof conduct on the part of the home government.\r\n\r\nTHE MISSISSIPPI ELECTION OF 1875\r\n\r\nIn 1876 I was made chairman of a committee of the Senate charged with\r\nthe duty of investigating the election of 1875 in the State of\r\nMississippi.  My associates were Cameron of Wisconsin, McMillan of\r\nMissouri, Bayard of Delaware, and McDonald of Missouri.\r\n\r\nBy the election of 1875 the Republican Party had been overthrown and\r\nthe power of the Democratic Party established upon a basis which has\r\ncontinued firm, until the present time.  The question for investigation\r\nwas this:  Was the election of 1875 an honest election?  There was an\r\nagreement of opinion that there were riots, shootings and massacres.\r\nOn the side of the Democrats it was contended that these outrages had\r\nno political significance, that they were due to personal quarrels,\r\nand to uprisings of negroes for the purpose of murdering the whites.\r\nThe testimony was of the same character and the conclusions of the two\r\nbranches of the committee followed the lead of these conflicting\r\ntheories and statements.  For myself I had no doubt that the election\r\nof 1875 was carried by the Democrats by a preconcerted plan of riots\r\nand assassinations.  To me the evidence seemed conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe town of Aberdeen was the scene of murderous intimidation on the\r\nday of election, and at about eleven o'clock the Republicans left the\r\npolling place and abandoned the contest.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal witnesses for the Democrats was General Reuben\r\nDavis, a cousin of Jefferson Davis.  He had been a member of the\r\nThirty-sixth Congress, and he had resigned his seat to take part in the\r\nRebellion.  He was a Brigadier-General in the service, but without\r\ndistinction.  He explained and excused all the transactions at\r\nAberdeen and with emphasis and adroitness he laid the responsibility\r\nupon the Republicans.  Of certain things there was uncontradicted\r\ntestimony.  1.  That the Democrats placed a cannon near the voting-place\r\nand trained it upon the window where the Republicans, mostly negroes,\r\nwere to vote, and that there was a caisson at the same place.  2.  That\r\nthere was a company of mounted men and armed cavalry upon the ground.\r\n3.  That guns were discharged in the vicinity of the voting place.\r\n4.  That at about eleven o'clock the sheriff of the county, a white man\r\nand a Republican, who had been a colonel in the rebel army, made a\r\nbrief address to the Republican voters in which he said that there could\r\nbe no election and advised them to go to their homes.  This they did\r\nwithout delay.  The sheriff locked himself in the jail where he remained\r\nuntil the events of the day were ended.  General Davis insisted that\r\nall these demonstrations of apparent hostility had no significance--\r\nthat the artillery men had no ammunition--that the cavalry men were\r\nassembled for sport only--and that the discharge of muskets was made by\r\nboys and lawless persons, but without malice.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the State the canvass previous to the election was\r\ncharacterized by assassinations and midnight murders.  But all were\r\nexplained upon non-political grounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 General Davis offered himself to the electors as a Democratic\r\ncandidate for Congress.  The convention nominated another person.  He\r\nthen entered the field as an independent candidate.  He was defeated,\r\nor rather the Democrat was declared to have been elected.  The\r\nRepublicans had voted for Davis, and when the contest was decided by\r\nthe returning board Davis published a letter in which he charged upon\r\nthe Democratic leaders the conduct which in 1876, he had explained and\r\ndefended.  After the election of General Harrison in 1888, General Davis\r\nappeared at Indianapolis as a Republican, and as such he had an\r\ninterview with the President-elect.\r\n\r\nWhile I was conducting the investigation at Jackson, a stout negro from\r\nthe plantation sought an interview with me after he had been examined\r\nby the committee.  He was a mulatto of unusual sense, but he was under\r\na strong feeling in regard to the outrages that had been perpetrated\r\nupon the negro race.\r\n\r\nFinally he said:  \"Had we not better take off the leaders?  We can do it\r\nin a night.\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"No.  It would end in the sacrifice of the black population.\r\nIt would be as wrong on your part as is their conduct towards you.\r\nMoreover, we intend to protect you, and in the end you will be placed\r\non good ground.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a lesson and a warning in what that negro said.  If\r\nthe wrongs continue, some \"John Brown\" black or white, may appear in\r\nMississippi or South Carolina or in several states at once, and engage\r\nin a vain attempt to regain the rights of the negro race by brutal\r\ncrimes.  The negroes are seven million to-day, and they are increasing\r\nin numbers and gaining in wealth and intelligence.  The South, and\r\nindeed the whole country were not more blind to impending perils in the\r\ndays of slavery than we now are to the perils of the usurpation in\r\nwhich the South is engaged.  With such examples as this country\r\nfurnishes and with the traditions under whose influence all classes are\r\nliving, there will always be peril as long as large bodies of citizens\r\nare deprived of their legal rights.\r\n\r\nShould such a contest arise, there will be wide spread sympathy in the\r\nNorth, which might convert a servile or social war into a sectional\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nCOURTESY OF THE SENATE--SENATORIAL ELECTION OF 1887\r\n\r\nOne of my last acts as Secretary was to advise the President to nominate\r\na Mr. Hitchcock for collector of the port of San Diego, California.\r\nHitchcock was a lawyer by profession, a graduate of Harvard and a man of\r\ngood standing in San Diego.  Mr. Houghton, the member for the San Diego\r\ndistrict, had recommended a man who was a saloon-keeper and a Democrat\r\nin politics, but he had supported Houghton in the canvass.  Houghton's\r\nrequest was supported by Senator Sargent.  Upon the facts as then\r\nunderstood the President nominated Hitchcock and one of the first\r\nquestions of interest to me was the action of the Senate upon the\r\nnomination of Hitchcock which I supported.\r\n\r\nSargent appealed to what was known as the courtesy of the Senate a rule\r\nor custom which required Senators of the same party to follow the lead\r\nof Senators in the matter of nominations from the respective States.  To\r\nthis rule I objected.  I refused to recognize it, and I said that I\r\nwould never appeal to the \"courtesy\" of the Senate in any matter\r\nconcerning the State of Massachusetts.  Hitchcock was rejected.  The\r\nPresident nominated Houghton's candidate.\r\n\r\nThis action on my part was followed by consequences which may have\r\nprevented my re-election to the Senate.  When Judge Russell, who was\r\ncollector of the port of Boston, was about to resign, General Butler,\r\nwho had early knowledge of the purpose of Russell, secured from General\r\nGrant the nomination of his friend William A. Simmons.  Simmons had been\r\nin the army, he had had experience in the Internal Revenue Service and\r\nhis record was good.  He was, however, Butler's intimate friend, and\r\nall the hostility in the State against Butler, which was large, was\r\ndirected against the confirmation.  I was not personally opposed to\r\nSimmons, but I thought that his appointment was unwise in the extreme,\r\nand therefore I opposed his confirmation.  There were fair offers of\r\ncompromise on men who were free from objections, all of which were\r\nrefused by Butler.  The President declined to withdraw the nomination\r\nunless it could be made to appear that Simmons was an unfit man.  This\r\ncould not be done.  I was upon the Committee on Commerce to which the\r\nnomination was referred, and upon my motion the report was adverse to\r\nthe nomination.  Butler came to my room and denounced my action,\r\nsaying that he would spend half a million dollars to defeat my re-\r\nelection.  I said in reply:--\r\n\r\n\"You can do that if you choose, but you cannot control my action now.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate I opposed the confirmation on the ground that a majority\r\nof the Republican Party were dissatisfied, that it was an unnecessary\r\nact of violence to their feelings, that there were men who were\r\nacceptable who could be considered, and that the means by which the\r\nnomination was secured could not be defended.  I was then challenged to\r\nsay whether I appealed to the courtesy of the Senate.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not.  I ask for the rejection of Simmons upon the ground that\r\nthe nomination ought not to have been made.\"\r\n\r\nSumner appealed to the courtesy of the Senate, but he had then wandered\r\nso far from the Republican Party that his appeal was disregarded.\r\nSimmons was confirmed.\r\n\r\nEnough of the proceedings were made public to enable my opponents to\r\nallege that I might have defeated Simmons, and that my action was\r\ninsincere.  As a result I had no further political intercourse with\r\nButler, and when the contest came in 1877 his action aided Mr. Hoar in\r\nsecuring the seat in the Senate.  I presume, however, that Butler\r\npreferred my election, but he had hopes for himself, or at least that\r\nthe election would go to a third party.  A day or two before the\r\nelection he sent me a friendly despatch urging me to go to Boston.  I\r\nhad already determined to avoid any personal participation in the\r\ncontest.  That non-interference I have never regretted.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTORAL COMMISSION\r\n\r\nAs I now view the subject (1900) the Electoral Commission was an\r\nindefensible necessity.  In the division of parties it seemed\r\nimpossible, and probably it was impossible, to secure a result with\r\npeace to the country, except by a resort to extraordinary means.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill passed the two houses the chances were with the Democrats.\r\nJudge Davis was in the list of judges from the Supreme Court.  His\r\nsympathies, and perhaps his opinions, were with the Democratic Party,\r\nand there was reason to apprehend that he might incline to act with the\r\nDemocratic members of the commission.  After the passage of the bill\r\nJudge Davis was chosen Senator from Illinois, and Judge Strong became\r\na member.  Upon the pivotal questions the members acted upon their\r\npolitical opinions, or, most certainly in accordance with them.\r\n\r\nI voted for the bill upon the understanding that there was no specific\r\nauthority for such a proceeding.  Indeed, the questions might have been\r\nreferred to the mayors of New York and Brooklyn, upon grounds equally\r\ndefensible in a legal point of view, although the tribunal selected was\r\nmuch better qualified for the duty.  Having agreed to the use of an\r\nunconstitutional tribunal, or to an extra constitutional tribunal, I\r\nhad no qualms about accepting the result.  Nor was I especially\r\ngratified by the action of the commission.  My connections with Mr.\r\nConkling led me to think that he had great doubts about the propriety\r\nof the decision in the case of Louisiana, and that doubt may have led\r\nhim to avoid the vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\nREVISION OF THE STATUTES OF THE UNITED STATES, 1878\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the Committee on the Revision of the Statutes, I framed\r\nand reported the amendments to the Revised Statutes, which were\r\nafterwards incorporated in the edition of 1878, which I prepared by\r\nthe appointment of President Hayes after my term in the Senate expired,\r\nwhich was made probably, upon the recommendation of Attorney-General\r\nDevens and without any solicitation on my part, or by any of my friends,\r\nas far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe edition of 1878 contains references to every decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt down to and including volume 194.  It contains a reference to the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, all arranged and classified under the\r\nvarious sections, articles and paragraphs of that instrument.  In doing\r\nthis work I was compelled to read all the opinions of the Court from\r\nthe beginning of the Government, so far, at least, as to understand\r\nthe character of each opinion.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the index was the work of months.  Its value is great\r\nand the credit is due to Chief Justice Richardson who not only aided me,\r\nbut he devised the plan and gave direction to the work as it went on.\r\nIt was our rule to index every provision under at least three heads,\r\nand in many cases there is a sub-classification under the general\r\ndesignation.  We avoided an error into which many writers fall--we\r\nnever indexed under the lead of an adjective, article or participle.\r\n\r\nFRENCH AND AMERICAN CLAIM COMMISSION, 1880\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Mr. Evarts, the Secretary of State, invited me to act as\r\ncounsel for the Government in defence of the claims of French citizens\r\nfor losses sustained during the Civil War.  There were more than\r\nseven hundred cases and the claims amounted to more than thirty-five\r\nmillion dollars including interest.  The recoveries fell below six\r\nhundred and thirty thousand dollars.  The printed record covered sixty\r\nthousand pages, and my printed arguments filled about two thousand\r\npages.  The discussion and decisions involved many important questions\r\nof international law, citizenship, the construction of treaties, and\r\nthe laws of war.\r\n\r\nThe chairman was Baron de Arinos.  He was a man of unassuming manners,\r\nof great intelligence, and of extensive acquaintance with diplomatic\r\nsubjects.  He was reserved, usually, but he was never lacking in ability\r\nwhen a subject had received full consideration at his hands.  As far as\r\nI recall his decisions, when he had to dispose of cases on which the\r\nFrench and American commissioners differed, I cannot name one which\r\nappeared to be unjust.\r\n\r\nThe insignificant sum awarded was due to many circumstances.  Of those,\r\nwho as French citizens had suffered losses during the war, many had\r\nbecome American citizens by naturalization.  Again others were natives\r\nof Alsace and Lorraine, and the commission held that they were not\r\nentitled to the protection of France in 1880 when the treaty was made.\r\nBut the losses were chiefly due to the absence of adequate evidence as\r\nto the ownership of the property for which claims were made, and to the\r\nenormous exaggerations as to values in which the claimants indulged.\r\n\r\nCOURTS-MARTIAL\r\n\r\nBetween the year 1880 and the year 1895 there were five general courts-\r\nmartial held in the city of Washington and I appeared for the defendants\r\nin four of them.\r\n\r\nI was also retained for the investigation of two cases of officers of\r\nthe Navy who had been convicted by courts-martial, one of them held in\r\nthe waters of China and the other on the coast of Brazil.  The latter,\r\nthe case of Reed, which may be found in volume 100 of the United States\r\nReports, became important as the first attempt by the Supreme Court to\r\ndefine and limit the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals over the\r\nproceedings of courts-martial.\r\n\r\nThe courts consist of thirteen officers of the service to which the\r\naccused may belong, and by a majority in number they are his seniors in\r\nrank, if the condition of the service will permit such a selection.\r\n\r\nA court thus constituted is an imposing tribunal, and in dignity of\r\nappearance not inferior to the Supreme Court of the United States.  The\r\nmembers are well instructed in the requirements of the service, but\r\ntheir knowledge of the science of law, especially in its technicalities,\r\nis limited.  It is the theory of the system that the judge-advocate\r\nwill be an impartial adviser of the court and that he will protect the\r\naccused against any irregular proceeding and especially protect him\r\nagainst the admission of any testimony that would be excluded in an\r\nordinary court of law.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however, the judge advocate becomes the attorney of the\r\nGovernment, especially when the accused has the aid of counsel.  His\r\nadvice to the court becomes the rule of the court.  Questions of\r\ntestimony are important usually, and the line between what is competent\r\nand that which should be excluded is often a very delicate line.  The\r\njudge should be a disinterested person.  It is too much to assume that\r\nan advocate can in a moment transform himself into an impartial judge.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Reed, which was an application by a _habeas corpus_\r\nproceeding for the discharge of Reed from prison, the Supreme Court\r\nheld that it could not examine the proceedings of the court-martial\r\nfurther than to inquire whether the act charged was an offence under\r\nthe rules of the service, and, second, whether the punishment was one\r\nwhich the court had power to impose.\r\n\r\nThus it follows, that intermediate errors and wrongs whether by the\r\nexclusion or admission of testimony, or by corruption even, cannot be\r\nremedied by judicial tribunals on the civil side.\r\n\r\nA partial remedy for possible evils may be found through the appointment\r\nof a judge from the civil courts, or of an experienced lawyer who should\r\nbecome the adviser of the court-martial, in place of the judge-advocate\r\n--thus leaving to him the duties of an attorney in behalf of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\nLAST OF THE OCEAN SLAVE-TRADERS*\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1861, a bark, registering 215 tons, anchored in\r\nthe bay of Port Liberté, a place of no considerable importance, on the\r\nnortherly coast of the island of Hayti, about twenty miles from the\r\nboundary of Santo Domingo.  The vessel carried the flag of France, and\r\nthe captain called himself Jules Letellier.  The name of the vessel\r\nwas not painted upon the stern, as is required by our law; but the\r\ncaptain gave her name as _Guillaume Tell_, bound from Havana to Havre.\r\nHe stated that he had suffered a disaster at the island of Guadaloupe,\r\nand that he had been compelled to throw a part of his cargo overboard.\r\nHe said also that his object in putting into the port was to obtain\r\nassistance for the recovery of his cargo; and for that purpose he\r\nsolicited recruits.  The authorities became suspicious of the craft, and\r\nan arrest was made of the vessel, her officers and men.  After some\r\ndelay the vessel was sent to Port au Prince, where she was condemned\r\nand confiscated upon the charge of being engaged \"in piracy and slave-\r\ntrading on the coast of Hayti.\"\r\n\r\nUpon investigation it appeared that the true name of the vessel was\r\n_William_, and that the name of the captain was Antonio Pelletier.\r\nPelletier was tried according to the laws of Hayti, convicted and\r\nsentenced to death.  The sentence was commuted to imprisonment for a\r\nterm of years.  The facts of his arrest and of the sentence pronounced\r\nupon him were published in the New York _Herald;_ and thereupon, as it\r\nappeared in the investigation that was afterward made, his wife\r\nmarried and, taking Pelletier's two children, left the country.\r\nPelletier was kept in prison for about two years, when he escaped,\r\nprobably with the connivance of the authorities.  He returned to the\r\nUnited States.  Previous to his escape he gained the confidence of\r\nthe commissioner of the United States at Port au Prince, who made a\r\nreport in his behalf and upon the ground that he had been arrested,\r\ntried and convicted for an offense of which he was not guilty.\r\n\r\nThat report was made to the Department of State, when Mr. Seward was\r\nSecretary of State.  Mr. Seward declined to act, upon two grounds--\r\nfirst, it was not proved that Pelletier was a citizen of the United\r\nStates; and second, the course of Hayti seemed justified by the facts\r\nas they then appeared.  Pelletier presented a statement of his claim,\r\namounting in all to about $2,500,000.  He placed the value of the bark\r\n_William_ and her cargo, with some money which he claimed was on her,\r\nat about $92,000.  He claimed also that he had been subjected to many\r\nlosses in business transactions, which he had been unable to consummate\r\nowing to his arrest in Hayti.  These amounted to about $750,000.  The\r\nmost extraordinary claim was the claim for damages to his person, in\r\nthe matter of his arrest and captivity, and the loss of his wife,\r\nchildren and home, for all of which he charged $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe claimant pressed his claim persistently to the State Department;\r\nand in the year 1884, when Mr. Frelinghuysen was Secretary of State,\r\na protocol was entered into between him and Mr. Preston, then minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the republic of Hayti, by which this claim, with\r\nanother large claim in behalf of A. H. Lazare against the republic of\r\nHayti, was submitted to an international arbitrator,--the Hon. William\r\nStrong, formerly a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nThe republic of Hayti retained Charles A. de Chambrun and myself as\r\ncounsel for the defence.  This hearing occupied one year of time, and\r\nthe documents and the testimony taken covered two thousand printed\r\npages.  The investigation showed that Pelletier was born at\r\nFontainebleau in France in the year 1819.  At the age of fourteen he\r\nran away from his home and country and came to the United States, where\r\nhe found employment on board a ship, which was owned and navigated\r\nby one Blanchard of the State of Maine.  From about the year 1835 to\r\nthe year 1850, Pelletier was employed upon shipboard in various menial\r\ncapacities, until finally he became master of several small vessels,\r\nwhich were employed on short voyages in the Caribbean Sea and on the\r\ncoast of South America.  About the year 1850 he appeared in the city\r\nof New York, and between that time and 1859 he was in the city of\r\nChicago, where on one occasion and as the representative of some local\r\nparty he was a candidate for alderman.  He was also engaged for a time\r\nin the manufacture of boots and shoes at Troy, New York.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1860 there appeared a statement in the newspapers that\r\na bark called the _William_ had been arrested and condemned at Key West\r\nupon the charge of having been fitted out for the slave trade.  Guided\r\nby that notice, Pelletier went to Havana, and employed an agent to go\r\nto Key West and to purchase the bark.  The purchase was made at a cost\r\nof $1,504.  In Pelletier's statement of his claim, he asserted that he\r\npaid something over $10,000 for the vessel.  From Key West the vessel\r\nwas sent to Mobile in charge of a man named Thomas Collar, who became\r\nPelletier's mate, but who was known on the vessel as Samuel Gerdon.  At\r\nMobile the _William_ was fitted out for the voyage under the direction\r\nand apparent ownership of a firm in that city known as Delauney, Rice\r\n& Co., of which Pelletier claimed to be a member and proprietor to the\r\nextent of $50,000, the patrimony which he had received upon the death\r\nof his father.  The vessel was freighted with lumber, and was cleared\r\nfor Carthagena, New Granada, in October.  She arrived at that port\r\nlate in November.  The investigation showed that a portion of the lumber\r\nwas placed upon the deck when there was space below where it might have\r\nbeen stored.  It appeared also that the vessel contained a large number\r\nof water casks, some twenty or twenty-five, about twenty pairs of\r\nmanacles, a quantity of ammunition, and that the number of sailors was\r\nconsiderably in excess of the number required for the navigation of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nAt Carthagena Pelletier made a contract with a colored man named Cortes,\r\nto carry him with his wife and children and servant to a point on the\r\ncoast east of Carthagena, known as Rio de Hache.  This contract he\r\nnever performed.  The original object of the voyage, as he alleged,\r\nwas to obtain a cargo of guano, at an island which he named Buida.  As\r\na matter of fact, there is no such island, or at any rate none could\r\nbe found on the maps, nor was its existence known to the officers of\r\nour Government who had been engaged in taking soundings in the Caribbean\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nWhile the _William_ was at Carthagena, one of the men deserted and\r\nnotified the commander of a British man-of-war that the object of the\r\nvoyage of the bark _William_ was a cargo of negroes to be carried to\r\nthe United States and sold as slaves.  Following the desertion of this\r\nman, Pelletier left Carthagena and, instead of proceeding to Rio de\r\nHache, which was understood to be the destination of the British man-of-\r\nwar, he took a northerly course toward the island of Grand Inagua.\r\nUpon this change of the course of the vessel, Cortes became alarmed for\r\nhis safety, and he urged Pelletier to put him ashore, and especially\r\nfor the reason that the shades of maternity were falling on his wife.\r\nAfter a delay of ten days, Pelletier consented to land him, which he\r\ndid at Grand Inagua, and secured in payment the goods and effects which\r\nCortes had on board the vessel, and which were understood to be of the\r\nvalue of $500 or more.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1861, Pelletier arrived in the harbor of Port-\r\nau-Prince, Hayti, where he was accused of being engaged in a slave-\r\ntrading expedition by five of his men whom he had landed and caused to\r\nbe put in prison on the charge of insubordination.  The authorities were\r\nso well convinced of the unlawful character of the expedition that they\r\nordered Pelletier to leave without delay.  He was conveyed out of the\r\nharbor by an armed vessel, and upon the understanding that he was to\r\nsail for New Orleans.  As a matter of fact, however, he employed the\r\nmonths following, until April, in expeditions among the islands of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.  In the course of the investigation, Pelletier appeared\r\non the stand as a witness.  In a series of questions which I put to\r\nhim, I asked for the names of the vessels which he had commanded,\r\nprevious to the voyage of the _William_.  Among others he mentioned the\r\n_Ardennes_, which was an American ship, registered.  It turned out upon\r\nfurther investigation that that ship was fitted out by him at\r\nJacksonville in the year 1859, and cleared for the Canary Islands.  Her\r\ncargo consisted of rum, sugar, cigars and tobacco.  From the admission\r\nof Pelletier it appeared that he never reached the Canary Islands, but\r\nmade the coast of Africa, near the mouth of the Congo River.  Upon\r\nbeing pressed for a reason for the change, he stated that he had been\r\ndriven there by a storm.  We were able to cause an examination to be\r\nmade of the records of the _Pluto_, a British man-of-war, that\r\ndiscovered the _Ardennes_ near Magna Grand in April, 1859.  The officers\r\nof the _Pluto_ boarded the _Ardennes_, and made such an examination as\r\nthey thought proper.  The captain made this entry after an examination\r\nof the vessel's papers and register, namely:  \"Which, though not\r\nappearing to be correct, I did not detain or molest them.\"  The\r\n_Ardennes_ lingered in the vicinity of the mouth of the Congo, where she\r\nwas arrested by the officers of the United States ship _Marion_, under\r\ncommand of Captain Brent.  The results of the examination which he\r\nmade and the circumstances of which he obtained knowledge were such that\r\nhe took possession of the vessel and sent her to New York upon the\r\ncharge of being engaged in the slave trade.  The evidence produced at\r\nNew York was not sufficient to lead the court to condemn her, but the\r\njudge gave a certificate that there was probable cause for her arrest.\r\n\r\nThe real character of the voyage of the _William_ from Mobile was\r\nfinally established beyond all controversy.  In the year 1880, a treaty\r\nwas made between the United States and France, by which an international\r\ncommission was created for the purpose of determining the validity of\r\nclaims made by citizens of the United States against France and of\r\nclaims made by citizens of France against the United States.  Among\r\nthe claimants against the United States were two Frenchmen by the name\r\nof Le More, residents of New Orleans.  At the time of the capture of\r\nNew Orleans in the year 1862, these men had in their possession a large\r\nsum of money belonging to the Confederate government.  By the\r\nproclamation of General Butler, made immediately upon the capture of\r\nthe city, all intercourse with the Confederate authorities by residents\r\nof New Orleans was interdicted.  Notwithstanding the proclamation, the\r\nLe Mores contrived to convey the funds in their possession across the\r\nline, and to procure their delivery to the Confederate authorities.\r\nGeneral Butler, having obtained knowledge of this transaction, had the\r\nLe Mores brought before him.  He then questioned them, and upon his\r\nown judgment and without trial he sent them as prisoners to Ship\r\nIsland, where they were confined for a time with an attachment of a\r\nball and chain.  Each of these men presented a claim to the commission,\r\nand, there being no defence, an award of $20,000 was made to each.  If\r\nGeneral Butler had convened a military court or commission, as he should\r\nhave done, and had obtained a conviction, as he would have obtained one,\r\nhe would not have subjected the United States to the judgments which\r\nwere rendered finally.\r\n\r\nIn that hearing, De Chambrun represented the Government of France and I\r\nrepresented the Government of the United States.  Thus having knowledge\r\nof the Le Mores, who were yet in New Orleans, we applied to them for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining the character of Delauney, Rice & Co., and\r\nalso whether there was any person living who had knowledge of the\r\nfitting out of the bark _William_.  They found a man by the name of\r\nLouis Moses, who had been a resident of New Orleans since the year\r\n1852, and who was well acquainted with the house of Delauney, Rice &\r\nCo., having transacted business for it, and who was himself concerned\r\nin the fitting out of the bark _William_.  He had indeed invested, in\r\none form or another, the sum of $15,000 in the enterprise, of which he\r\nhad evidence in writing.  He stated that the object of the voyage was\r\nto obtain a cargo of negroes in some of the islands of the Caribbean\r\nSea, and to bring them to a desert island on the west bank of the\r\nMississippi, near the mainland of Louisiana; in fine, that there was\r\nno purpose to obtain a cargo of guano.\r\n\r\nWhen the hearing commenced, in the year 1884, Pelletier came before the\r\narbitrator in perfect health and with the appearance of a man of ability\r\nand of fortune.  After an acquaintance of about a year I was able to use\r\nthis language in my final arguments:  \"It is a singular circumstance\r\nthat Captain Pelletier has not produced an original paper or document\r\nin support of his claim.  He is sixty years of age or more.  He is a\r\nman not deficient in intellectual capacity, whatever else may be said\r\nof him.  He is endowed by nature with ability for large and honest\r\nundertakings.  He claims to have had an extensive business experience;\r\nto have been the possessor of large wealth; to have been trusted in\r\nfiduciary ways; and he comes here and claims compensation for a great\r\noutrage, as he alleges, upon his person and his rights; and yet he has\r\nnot produced a paper that has the signature of any being, living or\r\ndead, by which he can sustain the claim he makes.  What is his answer\r\nin regard to the absence of papers?  It is that they were on board the\r\nbark _William_.  According to the best information we can obtain, that\r\nbark was not less than twelve or fifteen years of age.  We know that it\r\ndid not much exceed two hundred tons burden.  It was bound on a voyage\r\ninto tempestuous seas; and, leaving behind him wealth, as he says, to\r\nbe measured by the million, he embarks on that vessel with all his\r\npapers, including title deeds, articles of copartnership, powers of\r\nattorney, and preliminary accounts relating to unsettled affairs.  He\r\nis a member of the house of Delauney, Rice & Co., in which he had\r\ndeposited his patrimony to the extent of fifty thousand dollars; and\r\nhe carries away on that frail bark all evidence of his investment in\r\nthat firm.  He had, he said, a partnership agreement; he had accounts\r\nof profits that had been rendered from time to time,--and all are gone.\r\nHe had a dear wife and two children, for whose loss he now demands large\r\ncompensation; and yet he carried away the evidence of which their right\r\nto his estate would have depended, in case of his death.  The statement\r\nmay be true, but in the nature of things it is not probable.  That we\r\nmay believe a statement of that sort, evidence is required, not from\r\none man unknown, not from one man impeached, but from many men of\r\nreputable standing in society.  It is not to be believed that a man\r\nwho had been engaged in transactions measured by hundreds of thousands\r\nof dollars, through a period of ten years, should take every evidence\r\nof those transactions on board a vessel of hardly more than two\r\nhundred tons burden, manned by a crew composed of highbinders, as he\r\nhas described them, and sail to foreign lands, over tempestuous seas,\r\nupon the poor pretext of procuring guano for the plantations of\r\nLouisiana,--and this, as he says, when war was imminent.\"\r\n\r\nIn my argument to the arbitrator I attempted to trace the voyage of the\r\n_Ardennes_ and the voyage of the _William_ with as much minuteness as\r\nseemed to me to be wise under the circumstances, and for the sole\r\npurpose of establishing the charge that Pelletier was engaged in the\r\nslave trade.  The character of the voyage of the _Ardennes_ was\r\nimportant in view of the rule of law that, in the trial of a person\r\ncharged with the crime of slave-trading, evidence is admissible which\r\ntends to prove that the accused had been engaged in similar\r\nundertakings at about the same time.\r\n\r\nMy argument occupied the business hours of two sessions of the court.\r\nAt the opening of the court Pelletier appeared, took a seat, and\r\nremained during the first thirty or forty minutes of my argument,\r\nwhen he disappeared.  The New York _Herald_, on the morning of the\r\nthird day after Pelletier's last appearance, contained the announcement\r\nthat Antonio Pelletier had died suddenly at the Astor House in the city\r\nof New York.  The hearing proceeded, and on the 30th day of June, 1885,\r\nMr. Justice Strong filed his opinion in the Department of State.  In\r\nthat opinion, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly escape from the conviction that the voyage of the bark\r\n_William_ was an illegal voyage; that its paramount purpose was to\r\nobtain a cargo of negroes, either by purchase or kidnaping, and bring\r\nthem into slavery in the State of Louisiana; and that the load of\r\nlumber, and the profession of a purpose to go for a cargo of guano\r\nwere mere covers to conceal the true character of the enterprise.\"  He\r\nstates also \"that Pelletier had applied to a Haytian to obtain fifty\r\nmen and some women, blacks, of course, to assist him in obtaining\r\nguano.\"  The arbitrator found, however, that by the law of nations the\r\ncourts of Hayti had no jurisdiction of the case.  \"It is undeniable,\"\r\nsaid Justice Strong, \"that none of them were piratical in view of the\r\nlaw of nations.\"\r\n\r\nBy the _act d'accusation_ Pelletier was charged with piracy and slave-\r\ntrading on the coast of Hayti.  The arbitrator found that he was not\r\nguilty of piracy and that the act of slave-trading was never committed,\r\nalthough the design and purpose of the voyage were perfectly clear.\r\nThe claims as presented were all rejected by the arbitrator, except the\r\nclaim for injury to Pelletier personally by his confinement in prison.\r\nFor that injury the arbitrator allowed Pelletier the sum of $25 a day\r\nduring his confinement, and the interest thereon up to the time the\r\njudgment was rendered, amounting in all to $57,250.\r\n\r\nWhen the judgment had been rendered, the counsel for Hayti presented\r\na memorial to the State Department, setting forth the impropriety and\r\nbad policy of a presentation by the Government of the United States of\r\na judgment rendered in favor of a claimant who had been found guilty of\r\nfitting out a slave-trading expedition within the limits of the United\r\nStates, and using the flag of the United States as a protection in the\r\nprosecution of his illegal undertaking.  Mr. Bayard was then Secretary\r\nof State, and Mr. Cleveland was President.  That view of the counsel\r\nof Hayti was accepted by the Secretary of State and by the President,\r\nand the government of Hayti was relieved from the payment of the claim.\r\nI ought to add that Mr. Justice Strong concurred with the counsel for\r\nHayti, and made a representation to the Department of State urging\r\nthe remission of the penalty in the judgment he had rendered.\r\n\r\nThe decision of Mr. Justice Strong raises a question of very serious\r\ncharacter--that is to say, whether an international tribunal can take\r\nnotice of proceedings in the judicial tribunals of a foreign state,\r\nfurther than to ascertain whether the proceedings were according to\r\n\"due process of law\" in the state where the proceedings were had.\r\nJustice Strong went so far as to hold that the courts of Hayti had erred\r\nupon the question of their own jurisdiction.  Such a ruling, if applied\r\nto cases of public importance, might lead to very serious results.\r\n\r\n[* Printed in the _New England Magazine_.  Copyright, 1900, by Warren\r\nF.

LINCOLN AS AN HISTORICAL PERSONAGE.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED BEFORE THE LA SALLE CLUB, CHICAGO, FEBRUARY 12, 1889\r\n\r\nThe services and fame of Mr. Lincoln are so identified with the\r\norganization, doings and character of the Republican Party, that\r\nsomething of the history of that party is the necessary incident of\r\nevery attempt to set forth the services and the fame of Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIn a very important sense Mr. Lincoln may be regarded as the founder of\r\nthe Republican Party.  He was its leader in the first successful\r\nnational contest, and it was during his administration as President\r\nthat the policy of the party was developed and its capacity for the\r\nbusiness of government established.  The Republican Party gave to Mr.\r\nLincoln the opportunity for the services on which his fame rests, and\r\nthe fame of Mr. Lincoln is the inheritance of the Republican Party.\r\nHis eulogy is its encomium, and therefore when we set forth the\r\ncharacter and services of Mr. Lincoln we set forth as well the claims\r\nof the Republican Party to the gratitude and confidence of the country,\r\nand the favorable opinion of mankind.\r\n\r\nIf it could be assumed that for the Republican Party the Book of Life\r\nis already closed, it is yet true that that party is an historical\r\nparty and Mr. Lincoln is an historical personage, not less so than\r\nCromwell, Napoleon, or Washington, and all without the glamor that\r\nrests upon the brows of successful military chieftains.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Lincoln's predecessors in the Presidential office, two only,\r\nWashington and Jefferson, can be regarded as historical persons in a\r\nlarge view of history.  The author of the Declaration of Independence\r\nis so identified with the history of the country that that history\r\ncannot outlast his name and fame.\r\n\r\nAs the author of that Declaration and as the exponent of new and\r\nadvanced ideas of government, Jefferson was elected to the Presidency,\r\nbut his administrations, excepting only the acquisition of Louisiana,\r\nwere not marked by distinguished ability, nor were they attended or\r\nfollowed by results which have commanded the favorable opinion of\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\nWashington had no competitors.  The gratitude of his countrymen rebuked\r\nall rivalries.  He was borne to the Presidency by a vote quite\r\nunanimous, and he was supported in the discharge of his duties by a\r\nconfidence not limited by the boundaries of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is only a moderate exaggeration to say that when Mr. Lincoln was\r\nnominated for the Presidency, he was an unknown man; he had performed\r\nno important public service; his election was not due to personal\r\npopularity, nor to the strength of the party that he represented; but\r\nto the divisions among his opponents.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, when eleven hostile States were not represented in the\r\nGovernment, the weakness of the administration was such that only a\r\nbare majority of the House of Representatives was secured after a\r\nvigorous and aggressive campaign on the part of the Republican Party.\r\nThus do the circumstances and incidents of the formative period in\r\nMr. Lincoln's career illustrate and adorn the events that distinguished\r\nthe man, the party and the country.\r\n\r\nI am quite conscious that in our attempt to give Mr. Lincoln a\r\nconspicuous place in the ranks of historical personages, we are to\r\nencounter a large and intelligent public opinion which claims that\r\ndistance in time and even distance in space are the necessary conditions\r\nof a wise and permanent decision.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of that opinion maintain that contemporaries are too\r\nnear the object of vision, that to them a comprehensive view is\r\nimpossible, and that the successive generations of one's countrymen\r\nmay be influenced by inherited passions, or by transmitted traditions.\r\n\r\nSome of us were Mr. Lincoln's contemporaries, and one and all we are\r\nhis countrymen, and in advance we accept joyfully any qualifications\r\nof our opinions that may be made in other lands or by other ages, if\r\nqualifying facts shall be disclosed hereafter.  But nearness of\r\nobservation, and a knowledge of the events with which Mr. Lincoln's\r\npublic life was identified, may have given to his associates and\r\nco-workers opportunities for a sound judgment that were not possessed\r\nby contemporary critics and historians of other lands, and that the\r\nstudents of future times will be unable to command.\r\n\r\nThe recent practical improvements in the art of printing, the telegraph\r\nand the railway, have furnished to mankind the means of reaching safe\r\nconclusions in all matters of importance, including biography and\r\nhistory, with a celerity and certainty which to former ages were\r\nunknown.  In these five and twenty years, since the death of Mr.\r\nLincoln, there has been a wonderful exposition of the events and\r\ncircumstances of the stupendous contest in which he was the leading\r\nfigure, and all that knowledge is now consummated on the pages of\r\nNicolay and Hay's complete and trustworthy history.  Of the minor\r\nincidents of Mr. Lincoln's career, time and research will disclose\r\nmany facts not now known, which may lend coloring to a character whose\r\nmain features, however, cannot be changed by time nor criticism.  The\r\nnature of Mr. Lincoln's services we can comprehend, but their value\r\nwill be more clearly realized and more highly appreciated by posterity.\r\nAs to the nature of those services the judgment of his own generation\r\nis final--it can never be reversed.  Indeed, it may be asserted of\r\nhistorical personages generally, that the judgment of contemporaries is\r\nnever reversed.  Attempts have been made to reverse the judgment of\r\ncontemporaries, in the cases of Judas Iscariot, of Henry the Eighth,\r\nand of Shakespeare, and I venture the assertion that all these attempts\r\nhave failed, most signally.  In our own country there have been no\r\nreversals.  Modifications of opinions there have been--growth in some\r\ncases, decrease in others, but absolute change in none.  The country\r\nhas grown towards Hamilton and away from Jefferson.  They are, however,\r\nas they were at the beginning of the last century, the representatives\r\nof antagonistic ideas in government, but their common patriotism is\r\nas yet unchallenged.  It is the fate of those who take an active part\r\nin public affairs, to be misjudged during their lives, but death\r\nsoftens the asperities of political and religious controversies and\r\ntempers the judgment of those who survive.  Franklin, Washington,\r\nJackson, Clay and Webster, are to this generation what they were to the\r\nsurvivors of the respective generations to which they belonged.  Mr.\r\nCalhoun has suffered by the attempt to make a practical application of\r\nhis ideas of government, but the nature and dangerous character of those\r\nideas were as fully understood at the time of his death as they are at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nI pass over as unworthy of serious consideration the detractions and\r\nattacks, sometimes thoughtless, and sometimes malicious, to which Mr.\r\nLincoln was subject during his administration.  He made explanations\r\nand replied to these detractions and attacks only when they seemed to\r\nput in peril the fortunes of the country; but when he made replies,\r\nthere were none found, either among his political friends or his\r\npolitical enemies who were capable of making an adequate answer.\r\nConsult, as we may consult, his correspondence in regard to the\r\ntransit of troops through Maryland, in regard to the invasion of\r\nVirginia, in case the city of Washington should be attacked or\r\nmenaced from the right bank of the Potomac, in regard to the suspension\r\nof the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_, in regard to the arrest\r\nof Vallandingham, in regard to our foreign relations, and, finally,\r\nconsult his numerous papers in regard to the objects for which the\r\nwar should be prosecuted, and the means, as well, by which it could be\r\nprosecuted.  Consider, also, that this work was done by a man called to\r\nthe head of an administration that had no predecessor, to the management\r\nof the affairs of a government distracted by civil war, its navy\r\nscattered, its treasury bankrupted, its foreign relations disturbed by\r\na traditional and almost universal hostility to republican institutions,\r\nand all while he was threatened constantly by an adverse public\r\njudgment in that section of the country in which his hopes rested\r\nexclusively.  And consider, also, that Mr. Lincoln had had little or\r\nno experience on the statesmanship side of his political career, that\r\nas an attorney and advocate he had dealt only with local and municipal\r\nlaws; that he was separated by circumstances from a practical\r\nacquaintance with maritime and international jurisprudence, and yet\r\nconsider further with what masterful force he rebuked timid or\r\nuntrustworthy friends who would have abandoned the contest and consented\r\nto the independence of the seceding States, in the vain hope that time\r\nmight aid in the recovery of that which by pusillanimity had been lost;\r\nwith what serenity of manner he put aside the suggestion of Mr. Seward\r\nthat war should be declared against France and Spain as a means of\r\nquieting domestic difficulties which were even then represented by\r\ncontending armies; with what calmness of mind he laid aside Mr.\r\nGreeley's letter of despair and self-reproach of July 29, 1861, and\r\nproceeded with the preparation of his programme of military operations\r\nfrom every base line of the armies of the Republic; with what skill and\r\nstatesmanlike foresight he corrected Mr. Seward's letter to Mr. Adams\r\nin regard to the recognition by Great Britain of the belligerent\r\ncharacter of the Confederate States; and, finally, consider with what\r\nfirmness and wisdom he annulled the proclamations of Fremont and\r\nHunter, and assumed to himself exclusively the right and the power to\r\ndeal with the subject of slavery in the rebellious States.  In what\r\nother time, to what other ruler have questions of such importance been\r\npresented, and under circumstances so difficult?  And to what other\r\nruler can we assign the ability to have met and to have managed\r\nsuccessfully all the difficult problems of the Civil War?  It cannot be\r\nclaimed for Mr. Lincoln that he had had any instructive military\r\nexperience, or that he had any technical knowledge of the military\r\nart; but it may be said with truth that his correspondence with the\r\ngenerals of the army, and his memoranda touching military operations\r\nindicate the presence of a military quality or facility, which in\r\nactual service might have been developed into talent or even genius.\r\nHis letter to General McClellan, of October 13, 1862, is at once a\r\nmemorable evidence and a striking illustration of his faculty on the\r\nmilitary side of his official career.  He sets forth specifically, and\r\nin the alternative, two plans of operation, and with skill and caustic\r\nseverity he contrasts the inactivity and delays of General McClellan,\r\nwith the vigor of policy and activity of movement which characterized\r\nthe campaign on the part of the enemy.  He brings in review the facts\r\nthat General McClellan's army was superior in numbers, in equipment,\r\nand in all the material of war.  The President in conclusion said:\r\n\"this letter is not to be considered as an order,\" and yet it is\r\ndifficult to reconcile the continued inactivity of General McClellan\r\nwith the claim of his friends that he was a patriotic, not to say an\r\nactive, supporter of the cause of the Union.  With that letter in hand\r\na patriotic and sensitive commander would have acted at once upon one\r\nof the alternatives presented by the President, or he would have formed\r\na plan of campaign for himself and ordered a movement without delay, or\r\nhe would have asked the President to relieve him from duty.  No one of\r\nthese courses was adopted, and the policy of inactivity was continued\r\nuntil Lee regained the vantage ground which he abandoned when he\r\ncrossed the Potomac into Maryland.  It is at this point, and in this\r\njuncture of affairs that the policy of Mr. Lincoln requires the\r\nexplanation of a friendly critic.  The historian of the future may\r\nwonder at the procrastination of the President.  He may criticize his\r\nconduct in neglecting to relieve McClellan when it was apparent that he\r\nwould not avail himself of the advantages that were presented by the\r\nvictory at Antietam.  The explanation or apology, is this, in substance:\r\nThe Army of the Potomac had been created under the eye of McClellan and\r\nthe officers and men were devoted to him as their leader and chief.\r\nThey had had no opportunity for instituting comparisons between him and\r\nother military men.  After Pope's defeat, the army had been unanimous,\r\nsubstantially, in the opinion that McClellan should be again placed in\r\ncommand.  The President had yielded to that opinion against his own\r\njudgment, and against the unanimous opinion of his Cabinet.  Having\r\nthus yielded, it was wise to test McClellan until the confidence of the\r\narmy and the country should be impaired, or, as the President hoped\r\nwould be the result, until McClellan should satisfy the Administration\r\nand the army, that he was equal to the duty imposed upon him.  Hence\r\nthe delay until the 5th of November, when McClellan was relieved,\r\nfinally, from the military service of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was known to those who were near President Lincoln, that he was a\r\ncareful student of the war maps and that he had daily knowledge of the\r\nposition and strength of our armies.  I recall the incident of meeting\r\nPresident Lincoln on the steps of the Executive Mansion at about eleven\r\no'clock in the evening of the day when the news had but just reached\r\nWashington that Grant had crossed the Black River and that the army was\r\nin the rear of Vicksburg.  The President was returning from the War\r\nOffice with a copy of the despatch in his hand.  I said:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, have you any news?\"  He said in reply:\r\n\r\n\"Come in, and I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading the despatch, the President turned to his maps and traced\r\nthe line of Grant's movements as he then understood and comprehended\r\nthose movements.  That night the President became cheerful, his voice\r\ntook on a new tone--a tone of relief, of exhilaration--and it was\r\nevident that his faith in our ultimate success had been changed into\r\nabsolute confidence.  In the dark days of 1862 he had never despaired\r\nof the Republic, when others faltered, he was undismayed.  He put aside\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Seward that he should surrender the chief\r\nprerogative of his office; he rebuked the suggestion of General Hooker\r\nthat he should declare himself dictator; and he treated with silent\r\ncontempt the advice of General McClellan, from Harrison's Landing, in\r\nJuly, 1862, that the President should put himself at the head of the\r\narmy with a general in command, on whom he could rely, and thus assume\r\nthe dictatorship of the Republic.  He asserted for himself every\r\nprerogative that the laws and the Constitution conferred upon him, and\r\nhe declined to assume any power not warranted by the title of office\r\nwhich he held.  He was resolute in his purpose to perform every duty\r\nthat devolved upon him, but he declared that the responsibility of\r\npreserving the Government rested upon the people.\r\n\r\nOf the officers who successively were at the head of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, none ever possessed his entire confidence, until General\r\nGrant assumed that command, in person.  His letter to General Grant\r\nwhen he entered upon the Campaign of the Wilderness contains conclusive\r\nevidence that his confidence was given to that officer, without\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\nTurning again to the civil side of his administration, consider the\r\nsteps by which he led the country up to the point where it was willing\r\nto accept the abolition of slavery in the States engaged in the\r\nrebellion.  History must soon address itself to generations of\r\nAmericans who will have had no knowledge of the institution of slavery\r\nas an existing fact.  Indeed, at the present moment, more than two\r\nthirds of the population of the United States have no memory of the\r\ntime when slavery was the dominating force in the politics of the\r\ncountry, when it was interwoven in the daily domestic life of the\r\ninhabitants of fifteen States; when it muzzled the press, perverted\r\nthe Scriptures, compelled the pulpit to become its apologist, and when\r\nsuccessive generations of statesmen were brought down on an \"equality\r\nof servitude\" before an irresponsible and untitled oligarchy.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1839, Mr. Clay estimated the value of the slaves at\r\n$1,200,000,000, and upon the same basis, their value in 1860, exceeded\r\n$2,000,000,000.  This estimate conveys only an inadequate idea of the\r\npower of slavery and it presents only an imperfect view of the\r\ndifficulties which confronted Mr. Lincoln in 1861 and 1862.  Delaware,\r\nMaryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri were slave States, and\r\nall of them, with the exception of Delaware, were hesitating between\r\nsecession and the cause of the Union.  They were in favor of the Union,\r\nif slavery could be saved with the Union, but it was doubtful in all\r\nthe year 1861, whether those States could be held, to the \"Lincoln\r\nGovernment\" as it was derisively called, if the abolition of slavery\r\nwere a recognized part of our public policy.  Nor is this even yet a\r\nfull statement of the difficulties which confronted Mr. Lincoln.  With\r\nvarying degrees of intensity, the Democratic Party of the North\r\nsympathized with the South in its attempts to dissolve the Union.\r\nDuring the entire period of the war, New York, Ohio and Indiana were\r\ndivided States, and Indiana was only kept in line by the active and\r\ndesperate fidelity of Oliver P. Morton.  In the presence of these\r\ndifficulties Mr. Lincoln recommended the purchase of all the slaves in\r\nthe States not in rebellion; then he suggested the deportation of the\r\nmanumitted slaves and the free blacks, to Central America, and for this\r\npurpose an appropriation was made; then came the proposition to give\r\npecuniary aid to States that might voluntarily make provision for the\r\nabolition of slavery, and then came, finally, the statute of July,\r\n1862, by which slaves captured, and the slaves of all persons engaged\r\nin the rebellion were declared to be free.  It is not probable that Mr.\r\nLincoln entertained the opinion that these measures, one or all, would\r\nsecure the complete abolition of slavery, but they gave to the slave-\r\nholders of the border States an opportunity to obtain compensation\r\nfor the loss of their slaves, and the pendency of these propositions\r\noccupied the attention of the country while the formative processes were\r\ngoing on, which matured finally in the opinion that slavery and the\r\nUnion could no longer co-exist.  In the same time the country arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that separation and continuous peace were impossible.\r\nThe alternative was this:  Slavery, a division of territory, and a\r\ncondition of permanent hostility on the one side; and on the other, a\r\nunion of States, domestic peace, a government of imperial power, with\r\nequality of citizenship in the States and an equality of States in the\r\nUnion.  Thus his measures, which were at once measures of expediency and\r\nof delay, prepared the public mind to receive his monitory Proclamation\r\nof September 1862.  In that time the border States had come to realize\r\nthe fact that the negroes were no longer valuable as property, and they\r\ntherefore accepted emancipation as a means of ending the controversy.\r\nTo the Republicans of the North, the Proclamation was a welcome message;\r\nto the Democrats it was a result which they had predicted, and against\r\nwhich they had in vain protested.  But the controversy would not have\r\nended with the war.  Slavery existed in the States that had not\r\nparticipated in the rebellion, and the legality of the Emancipation\r\nProclamation might be drawn in question in the courts.  One thing more\r\nwas wanted, an amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery\r\neverywhere within the jurisdiction of the Government.  This was secured\r\nafter a protracted struggle, and the result was due in a pre-eminent\r\ndegree to the personal and official influence of Mr. Lincoln.  In one\r\nphrase it may be said that every power of his office was exerted to\r\nsecure the passage, in the Thirty-eighth Congress, of the resolution,\r\nby which the proposed amendment was submitted to the States.  Mr.\r\nLincoln did not live to see the consummation of his great undertaking,\r\nin the cause of Freedom, but the work of ratification by the States\r\nwas accelerated by his death, and on the 18th day of December, 1865,\r\nMr. Seward, then Secretary of State of the United States, made\r\nproclamation that the amendment had been ratified by twenty-seven of the\r\nthirty-six States then composing the Union, and that slavery and\r\ninvoluntary servitude were from that time and forever forth impossible\r\nwithin our limits.  Such was then the universal opinion in all America.\r\nIt was our example that wrought the abolition of slavery in Brazil, and\r\nin colonies of Spain and Portugal; it has led to the extermination of\r\nthe trans-Atlantic slave trade, and it was an inspiration to the nations\r\nof Europe in their effort to destroy the traffic in human beings on the\r\ncontinent of Africa.\r\n\r\nThere is an aspect of Mr. Lincoln's career, which must attract general\r\nattention and command universal sympathy.  His loneliness in his office\r\nand in the performance of his duties is deeply pathetic.  It is true\r\nthat Congress accepted and endorsed his measures as they were presented\r\nfrom time to time, but there were bitter complaints on account of his\r\ndelays on the slavery question, and not infrequently doubts were\r\nexpressed as to the sincerity of his avowed opinions.  There were\r\nlittle intrigues in Congress, and personal aspirations in the Cabinet\r\nin regard to the succession.  Of the commanders of the Army of the\r\nPotomac from McDowell to Meade, each and all had failed to win\r\nvictories, or they had failed to secure the reasonable advantages of\r\nvictories won.  There were divisions in the Cabinet which were\r\naggravated by personal rivalries.  On one occasion, leading Republican\r\nmembers of Congress engaged in a movement for a change in the Cabinet;\r\na movement which was without a precedent and wholly destitute of\r\njustification under our system of government.\r\n\r\nHis want of faith in his Cabinet was shown in his preliminary statement\r\nwhen he proceeded to read the Proclamation of Emancipation.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas then about to take the most important step ever taken by a President\r\nof the United States and yet he informed the men, the only men whose\r\nopinions he could command by virtue of his office that the main\r\nquestion was not open for discussion; that the question had been by him\r\nalready decided, and that suggestions from them would be received only\r\nin reference to the formalities of the document.\r\n\r\nIt may be the truth, and our estimation of Mr. Lincoln would not be\r\nlowered, if, indeed, it were shown to be the truth, that he chose to\r\nact upon his own judgment in a matter of the supremest gravity, and\r\nin which, from the nature of the case, the sole responsibility was\r\nupon him.  On the great question of the abolition of slavery his mind\r\nreached a definite conclusion, a conclusion on which he could act, but\r\nneither too early nor too late.  The Proclamation was issued at a\r\nmoment when the exigencies of the war justified its issue as a military\r\nnecessity, and when, as a concurrent fact, the public mind was first\r\nprepared to receive it, and to give to the measure the requisite support.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln prepared the way for the reorganization of the government.\r\nUnder him the old order of things was overthrown and the introduction\r\nof a new order became possible.  Through his agency the Constitution\r\nof the United States has been brought into harmony with the Declaration\r\nof Independence.  The system of slavery has perished, the institutions\r\nof the country have been reconciled to the principles of freedom, and\r\nin these changes we have additional guarantees for the perpetuity of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nA just eulogy of Mr. Lincoln is a continuing encomium of the Republican\r\nParty.  By the election of 1860 he became the head of that party and\r\nduring the four years and more of his official life he never claimed\r\nto be better nor wiser than the party with which he was identified.\r\nFrom first to last he had the full confidence of the army and of the\r\nmasses of the voters in the Republican Party, and of that confidence\r\nMr. Lincoln was always assured.  Hence he was able to meet the\r\naspirations of rivals and the censures of the disappointed with a good\r\ndegree of composure.  To the honor of the masses of the Republican\r\nParty it can be said that they never faltered in their devotion to the\r\nPresident and in that devotion and in the fidelity of the President to\r\nthe principles of the party were the foundations laid on which the\r\ngreatness of the country rests.\r\n\r\nThe measure of gratitude due to Mr. Lincoln and to the Republican Party\r\nmay be estimated by a comparison of the condition of the country when he\r\naccepted power in March, 1861, with its condition in 1885, and in 1893,\r\nwhen we yielded the administration to the successors of the men who had\r\nwell-nigh wrecked the Government in a former generation.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party found the Union a mass of sand; it left it a\r\nstructure of granite.  It found the Union a by-word among the nations\r\nof the earth, it left it illustrious and envied, for the exhibition of\r\nwarlike powers, for the development of our industrial and financial\r\nresources in times of peace, for the unwavering fidelity with which\r\nevery pecuniary obligation was met; for the generous treatment\r\nmeasured out with an unstinted hand to the conquered foe; and, finally,\r\nfor the cheerful recognition of the duty resting upon the Republican\r\nParty and upon the country to enfranchise, to raise up, to recreate\r\nthe millions that had been brought out of bondage.\r\n\r\nThis work was not accomplished fully in Mr. Lincoln's time, but he was\r\nthe leader of ideas and policies which could have no other consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end it must be said of Mr. Lincoln that he was a great man, in a\r\ngreat place, burdened with great responsibilities, coupled with great\r\nopportunities, which he used for the benefit of his country and for the\r\nwelfare of the human race.  Among American statesmen he is conspicuously\r\nalone.  From Washington to Grant he is separated by the absence on his\r\npart of military service and military renown.  On the statesmanship side\r\nof his career, there is no one from Washington along the entire line\r\nwho can be considered as the equal or the rival of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAnd we may wisely commit to other ages and perhaps to other lands the\r\nfull discussion and final decision of the relative claims of\r\nWashington and Lincoln to the first place in the list of American\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\nSPEECH ON COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nDELIVERED AT GROTON, MASS., OCTOBER 21, 1892\r\n\r\nWe celebrate this day as the anniversary of the discovery of the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\n  \"The hand that rounded Peter's dome.\r\n   And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,\r\n   Wrought in a sad sincerity;\r\n   Himself from God he could not free;\r\n   He builded better than he knew.\"\r\n\r\nOf these lines of Emerson, the last three are as true of Columbus, as of\r\n\r\n  \"The hand that rounded Peter's dome,\r\n   And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,\"\r\n\r\nfor he, too,\r\n\r\n  \"Wrought in a sad sincerity;\r\n   Himself from God he could not free;\r\n   He builded better than he knew.\"\r\n\r\nAnd shall we therefore say that he is not worthy of praise, of tribute,\r\nof memorials, of anniversary days, of centennial years, of national and\r\ninternational gatherings and exhibitions, that in some degree mankind\r\nmay illustrate and dignify, if they will, the events that have followed\r\nthe opening of a new world to our advanced and advancing civilization?\r\n\r\nIn great deeds, in great events, in great names, there is a sort of\r\nimmortality, an innate capacity for living, a tendency to growth, to\r\nexpansion, and thus what was but of little comment in the beginning is\r\nseen, often after the lapse of years, possibly only after the lapse of\r\ncenturies, to have been freighted with consequences whose value can only\r\nbe measured by the yearly additions to the sum of human happiness.\r\n\r\nFranklin's experiments in electricity were followed at once by the\r\ncommon lightning-rod, but a century passed before the electrical power\r\nwas utilized, and made subservient, in some degree, to the control of men.\r\n\r\nEvery decade of three centuries has added to the greatness of that one\r\nimmortal name in the literature of the whole English speaking race.  The\r\nsecurity for the world that the name of Shakespeare and the writings of\r\nShakespeare cannot die may be found in the selfishness, the intelligent\r\nselfishness of mankind, which will struggle constantly to preserve and\r\nto magnify a possession which if once lost, could never be regained.\r\n\r\nAfter four centuries of delay we have come to realize, with some degree\r\nof accuracy, the magnitude of the event called the Discovery of America.\r\nIdentified with that event, and as its author, is the man Columbus.\r\nInvolved in controversies while living, the object of the base passions\r\nof envy, hatred and jealousy, consigned finally to chains and to prison,\r\nand in death ignorant of the magnitude of the discovery that he had\r\nmade, there seemed but slight basis for the conjecture that his name\r\nwas destined to become the one immortal name in the annals of modern\r\nItaly and Spain.\r\n\r\nAs if accident and fate and the paltry ambitions of men had combined to\r\nrob Columbus of his just title to fame, the name of the double continent\r\nthat he discovered was given to another.  To that other the name\r\nremains, but the continent itself has become the continent of Columbus.\r\nIn connection with the event no other name is known, and so it will\r\never be in all the centuries of the future.\r\n\r\nIn these years we are inaugurating a series of centennial anniversary\r\ncelebrations in honor of Columbus, and in testimony of the importance\r\nof the discovery that he made.  This we do as the greatest of the states\r\nthat have arisen on the continent that he discovered, and I delay what\r\nI have to say of Columbus and of the discovery that I may express my\r\nregret and the reasons for my regret, that the celebration and the\r\nceremonies have not been made distinctively and exclusively national.\r\nIn this I do not disparage, on the other hand I exalt, the public\r\nspirit, the capacity for large undertakings, the will and the courage\r\nof the city and the citizens of Chicago in assuming burdens and\r\nresponsibilities from which any other city on this continent would have\r\nshrunk.\r\n\r\nMy point is this:  If the people and Government of the United States\r\nwere of the opinion that the discovery of a continent--a continent in\r\nwhich one of the great governments of the world has found an abiding\r\nplace--was worthy of a centennial celebration, then the conduct of the\r\ncelebration ought not to have been left to the care of any community\r\nless than the whole.  Nor is it an unworthy thought that something of\r\ndignity would have been added to the celebration if the nations of the\r\nearth could have been invited to the capital which bears the name of\r\nthe discoverer of the continent and the founder of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThere are occasions which confer greatness upon an orator.  Such are\r\nrevolutionary periods, the overthrow of states, radical changes in a\r\nlong-settled public policy, struggles for power, empire, dominion.\r\nThese and kindred exigencies in the affairs of men and states, seem to\r\ncreate, or at least to furnish opportunity and scope for, statesmen,\r\norators, poets and soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis peaceful ceremony in peaceful times, of which we now speak, will\r\nnot produce orators like Patrick Henry and James Otis at the opening\r\nof our Revolutionary struggle, like Mirabeau in France, or Cicero in\r\nRome, pleading for a dying republic, or Demosthenes in Athens\r\ncontending hopelessly against the domination of one supreme will.\r\n\r\nAn orator for this occasion was not to have been waited for, he was to\r\nhave been sought out and found if possible.\r\n\r\nIf Webster were living and in the fullness of his powers, the country\r\nmight have looked to him for an oration that would have so linked itself\r\nwith the anniversary that it would have been recognized in every\r\nsucceeding centennial observance.\r\n\r\nTurning from this thought, which at best, can only serve as a standard\r\nto which our hopes aspire, I venture the remark, that there is not one\r\nof our countrymen who, by the studies of his life, by the philosophical\r\nqualities of his mind, by the possession in some large measure of that\r\nMiltonian power of imagination which Webster exhibited, is qualified for\r\nthe supreme task which I have thus imperfectly outlined.\r\n\r\nFor one day the rumor was voiced that Castelar of Spain had been invited\r\nto deliver the oration at the more formal opening of the exhibition in\r\nMay next.  That rumor has not been affirmed nor denied, but from the\r\ndelay, we cannot hope that its verification is now possible.\r\n\r\nHistorical knowledge, due to long and laborious studies, and the spirit\r\nof historical inquiry, are not often found in the same person, combined\r\nwith argumentative power and the quality of imagination stimulated by\r\nan emotional nature.  From what we know of Emilio Castelar of Spain, it\r\nmay be said that he possesses this rare combination in a degree beyond\r\nany other living man.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856 when he was only twenty-four years of age, he was\r\nappointed, after a competitive contest, to the chair of philosophy and\r\nhistory in the University of Madrid.  During his professorship, in\r\naddition to other work, he delivered lectures on the history of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe political disturbances, in which as a republican, he had taken an\r\nactive part, led to his exile for four years, but upon his return to\r\nSpain he resumed his place in the University.  In 1873 he was prime\r\nminister during the brief existence of the republic.  Of his published\r\nworks, the best known in this country is the volume entitled \"Old Rome\r\nand New Italy.\"  At present he is a member of the Cortes, where he\r\ngives support to the Government in its measures of administration\r\nwithout yielding his political principles or indorsing the monarchical\r\nsystem.  If this country were to pass beyond its own limits in the\r\nselection of an orator, then, without question Spain has the first,\r\nand indeed, the only claim to consideration.  Spain furnished the means\r\nfor the expedition and the world is indebted to her enlightened\r\npatronage for the discovery.  It may be assumed, reasonably, that\r\nCastelar would have brought from the archives of Spain fresh information\r\nin regard to the motives of Ferdinand and Isabella, trustworthy\r\nstatements as to the character and conduct of Pinzon, the ally of\r\nColumbus, and at the end he might have been able to prove or disprove\r\nthe theory that Columbus had knowledge of the existence of this\r\ncontinent, or that he had or had not reasons for believing that land\r\nin the west had been visited by Scandinavian voyagers in the tenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAs I pass to some more direct observations upon Columbus and the voyage\r\nof 1492, and to the expression of some thoughts as to the future of the\r\ncountry, I wish to say that I limit my criticism to our representative\r\nmen, whose estimate of the importance of the anniversary was quite\r\ninadequate.  They failed to see its connection with the past, its\r\nrelations to what now is, and more important than all else they failed\r\nto realize that this celebration is the first of a long line of\r\ncentennial celebrations, each one of which will mark the close of one\r\nepoch, and the beginning of another.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine that in a hundred years this anniversary, in its\r\norganization and conduct, will be thought worthy of imitation.  Let\r\nus imagine, or rather indulge the hope that then all the States of the\r\nsouth and the north, from the Arctic Seas to Patagonia, will be united\r\nin a national and international celebration in recognition of an event\r\nthat has increased twofold the possibilities, comfort and happiness of\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\nPassing from these criticisms, at once and finally, it is yet true that\r\nin this centennial celebration the two Americas, Southern Europe and\r\nthe Catholic churches throughout the world are united as one people,\r\nand for the moment differences in religion and diversities of race are\r\nforgotten.  Italy was the birth-place of Columbus; Spain, after long\r\nyears of doubt and vexatious delays lent its patronage to the scheme of\r\nthe \"adventurer\" as he was called; and the church, of which Columbus\r\nwas a devoted, and perhaps a devout disciple, bestowed its blessing\r\nupon those who staked their lives or their fortunes in the undertaking.\r\nIt is not probable that Columbus looked to that posthumous fame of which\r\nhe is now the subject.  His vision and his hopes extended not beyond the\r\npossession of new lands where he might rule as a potentate and enjoy\r\npower; where Spain might found an empire, and where the church might\r\nestablish its authority over millions of new converts.  Spain gained\r\nnew empires, and maintained her rule over them for three centuries and\r\nmore; the church enlarged its power by the acquisition of half a\r\ncontinent, in which its ecclesiastical authority remains, even to the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century.  For a moment, and but for a moment\r\nin the annals of time, Columbus was permitted to realize the dream of\r\nhis life.  After a brief period, however, instead of place, power,\r\ngratitude, wealth, he was subjected to chains, and consigned to prison.\r\nOf the three great parties to the undertaking, Columbus alone, seemed\r\nto have been unsuccessful, but at the end of four centuries he\r\nreappears as the one personage to whom the gratitude of mankind is due\r\nfor the discovery of the new world.  Nor do we enter into any inquiry\r\nas to the manner of man that Columbus was on the moral side of his\r\ncharacter.  We know that he was an enthusiast, that he was richly\r\nendowed with the practical virtues of patience, of perseverance, of\r\ncontinuing fortitude under difficulties, and we know that neither Spain,\r\nnor the Church, nor Pinzon the ship-builder and capitalist, nor all of\r\nthem together would have made the discovery when it was made.  To\r\nColumbus they were essential, but without Columbus they were nothing.\r\n\r\nTo the wide domain of history may be left the inquiry as to the truth\r\nof his visit to Iceland in the preceding decade, his knowledge of the\r\nexpeditions of the Scandinavian voyagers to Greenland and the coasts\r\nof New England in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and his theories\r\nor beliefs concerning the spherical figure of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have happened previous to the voyage from Palos, and\r\nwhatever might have been the extent of Columbus' knowledge, the\r\ndiscovery of America for the purposes of settlement and civilization,\r\nwas made by Columbus himself at eight o'clock in the evening of\r\nOctober 11, O. S., when he saw the shimmer of fire on the Island of\r\nSan Salvador.  That fact being established, the fact of the existence\r\nof land near by was established also.  The sight of land at three\r\no'clock next morning was not the discovery; it was evidence only of\r\nthe reality of the discovery made by Columbus the evening before.\r\n\r\nIn these four hundred years the empires that Spain founded in the New\r\nWorld have slipped from her grasp; the church has lost its temporal\r\npower, but the fame of Columbus has spread more and more widely and his\r\nclaims to the gratitude of mankind have been recognized more generally.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each coming century, and for many centuries, no one can\r\nforesay how many, millions on millions in the Americas and in Europe\r\nwill unite in rendering tribute of praise to the enthusiast and\r\nadventurer whose limited ambitions for himself were never realized, but\r\nwho opened to mankind the opportunity to found states freed from the\r\ndomination of the church and churches freed from the domination of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWe do not deceive ourselves, when we claim for the United States the\r\nfirst place among the states on this continent.  We are the first of\r\nAmerican states in population, in wealth, in our system of public\r\ninstruction, in our means of professional and technical education, in\r\nthe application of science to the practical purposes of life, and\r\nfinally, in experience and success in the business of government.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten by any of us, nor should the fact be\r\noverlooked or neglected by the young that these results have been\r\ngained by the labors and sacrifices of our ancestors, and we should\r\nrealize that the task of preserving what has been won, is the task that\r\nis imposed upon the generations as they succeed each other in the great\r\ndrama of national life.  Vain and useless are all conjectures as to\r\nthe future.  The coming century must bring great changes--equal,\r\npossibly, to those that have occurred since 1792.  At that time our\r\nterritory did not extend beyond the Mississippi River, our population\r\nwas hardly four million, our national revenues were less than four\r\nmillion dollars annually, manufacturing industries had not gained a\r\nfooting, for agricultural products there was no market, the trade in\r\nslaves from Africa was guaranteed in the Constitution, the thirteen\r\nStates had not outgrown the disintegrating influence of the\r\nConfederation, the Post-Office Department was not organized, and the\r\nNational Government was not respected for its power, justice or\r\nbeneficence, of which the mass of people knew nothing.\r\n\r\nIn this century our territory has been enlarged fourfold, our\r\npopulation is eighteen times as great as it was in 1792, our revenues\r\nhave been multiplied by a hundred, and the convertible wealth of the\r\npeople has been increased in a greater ratio even.  The railway, the\r\ntelegraphic, the telephonic systems have been created.  The dream of\r\nShakespeare has been realized--we have put a girdle round about the\r\nEarth in forty minutes.\r\n\r\nMore than all else, and as the culmination of all else, we have\r\ndemonstrated the practicability of a government of the people, by the\r\npeople, and for the people.  All this has been made possible by and\r\nthrough a system of universal public education--a system which taxes\r\nthe whole people, and educates the whole people in good learning, and\r\nin the cardinal virtues which adorn, dignify and elevate the individual\r\nman and furnish the only security for progressive, successful,\r\nillustrious national life.\r\n\r\nThis is the inheritance to which the generations before us are born.\r\nA great inheritance--a great inheritance of opportunity, a great\r\ninheritance of power, a great inheritance of responsibility, from which\r\nthe coming generations are not to shrink.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\nIMPERIALISM AS A PUBLIC POLICY\r\n\r\nThis paper is introduced upon two grounds mainly.  It sets forth with a\r\nreasonable degree of fulness the views that I have entertained for\r\nthree years in regard to President McKinley's policy in the acquisition\r\nand control of the islands in the Caribbean Sea and in the Pacific\r\nOcean, and it presents a history of my relations to political movements\r\nthrough a long half century.\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED AT SALEM, MASS., OCTOBER 18, 1900, IN REPLY TO A SPEECH\r\nMADE BY THE HONORABLE WILLIAM H. MOODY, M. C.\r\n\r\nA truthful statement that I have been inconsistent in the opinions that\r\nI have held and advocated upon questions of public concern, would not\r\ndisturb me by day, nor consign me to sleepless nights.\r\n\r\nIt is now sixty years since I first held public office by the votes of\r\nmy fellow-citizens.  In that long period of time my opinions have\r\nundergone many changes.  When I have had occasion to address my fellow-\r\ncitizens upon public questions I have not reviewed my previous sayings\r\nthrough fear that some critic might arraign me for inconsistency.\r\n\r\nI have considered only my present duty in relation to the questions\r\nimmediately before me.\r\n\r\nIn the first ten or fifteen years of my manhood I accepted political\r\neconomy as a cosmopolitan science and free trade as a wise policy for\r\nevery country.  My views in favor of free trade for the United States\r\nare set forth in printed articles, which are now accessible.  They are\r\nat the service of the critics and of the advocates of free trade.\r\nConsistency is not always a virtue, and inconsistency is not always a\r\nvice.  Even courts of justice change their rulings and holdings when\r\nthey find themselves in error.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has reversed its first decision\r\nin the cases that have arisen under the confiscation acts of 1862, and\r\nin other cases the court has qualified its opinions from time to time.\r\nThis authority is valuable as proving or as tending to prove, that\r\ninconsistencies in opinion may be consistent with integrity of purpose.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to change the issue while the trial is going on is not\r\ninfrequently the weak device of misguided advocates who happen to be\r\ncharged with the care of weak cases.\r\n\r\nIt is now twenty years of more since I appeared before Judge Endicott\r\nof your city in a cause between a trustee and the _cestui que_ trust.\r\nThe counsel for the trustee in an argument of considerable length,\r\nproceeded to demonstrate the unwisdom, the incapacity, indeed, of my\r\nadministration of the Treasury Department.  I made no attempt to meet\r\nthe new issue, and the Judge gave no opinion upon it.  I made an effort\r\nto satisfy the Judge that the trustee was withholding money that\r\nbelonged to my clients, and Judge Endicott so held.  My opponent had an\r\nopportunity to argue an issue that was not before the court, and his\r\nclient was doomed to lose his case.\r\n\r\nA cause is now pending before the American people.  The issue is this:\r\nIs it wise and just for us, as a nation, to make war for the seizure\r\nand government of distant lands, occupied by millions of inhabitants,\r\nwho are alien to us in every aspect of life, except that we are\r\ntogether members of the same human family?  The seriousness of this\r\nissue cannot be magnified by the art and skill of writers and speakers,\r\nnor can it be dwarfed to the proportions of a personal controversy.\r\nNor does it follow from any possible construction of the Constitution\r\nthat it is wise and just for the American people to seize, through\r\nwar, and to govern by force, the hostile tribes and peoples of the\r\nearth whether near to or remote.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of weak causes have two methods of defence to which they\r\nmost frequently resort:  epithets and a change of issues.\r\n\r\nIt was in this city that Mr. Webster made a remark that is applicable\r\nto the use of epithets and the avoidance of issues.  Mr. Webster had\r\ncome to this city to aid the Attorney-General in the trial of Frank\r\nand Joseph Knapp.  His presence was disagreeable to the counsel for\r\nthe accused, and they more than intimated that he had been brought to\r\nSalem to carry the court against the law, and to hurry the jury beyond\r\nthe evidence.  In reply, Mr. Webster referred to the Goodridge trial,\r\nin which he had appeared for the accused, and he said:  \"I remember\r\nthat the learned head of the Suffolk Bar, Mr. Prescott, came down in\r\naid of the officers of the government.  This was regarded as neither\r\nstrange nor improper.  The counsel for the prisoners, in that case,\r\ncontented themselves with answering his arguments, as far as they were\r\nable, instead of carping at his presence.\"  This is, in substance, the\r\ndemand that we make upon the supporters of the war in the Philippines.\r\nLet them cease to denounce us as traitors; let them explain the facts\r\non which they are arraigned; and let them answer the arguments that we\r\noffer in defence of the Republic.\r\n\r\nCauses may be lost by misinterpreting or misrepresenting the issues, or\r\nby undervaluing the character and ability of opponents, but causes are\r\nnot often won by such expedients.  The political issues in popular\r\ngovernments are the outcome of measures and policies, and the issues\r\ncan be changed only by a change of policies and measures.  President\r\nMcKinley's administration has been an administration of new policies and\r\nnew measures, and, consequently, it is an administration of new issues\r\n--issues that will remain until the measures and policies, to which they\r\nowe their origin, have been abandoned.  Therefore, the struggle to\r\nchange the issues, however made, or by whomsoever made, is a vain\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nIf, in this year 1900, it could be proved beyond controversy that in\r\nthe year 1859, I had maintained the doctrine that the Constitution of\r\nthe United States did not apply to the Territories, and that in the\r\nyear 1899 I had expressed the opposite opinion, would these facts,\r\nincluding the change of opinion, and whether considered together or\r\nconsidered separately, possess any value argumentative, or otherwise,\r\nas a justification of President McKinley in seizing the Philippine\r\nIslands through war, and in attempting to govern the inhabitants by\r\nforce?  Is it of any consequence when this country is dealing with a\r\npublic policy of which war is the incident, and the continuing\r\ninevitable incident, whether the opinions that one man may have\r\nentertained one and forty years ago are acceptable opinions now that\r\nthe one and forty years have passed away?  Yet, my fellow-citizens, this\r\nis the argument which the representative of the ancient and honored\r\ncounty of Essex offers to you and to the country in justification of\r\na policy of war degenerating at times into brutal massacres, carried on\r\nagainst ten million people, inhabitants of a thousand islands, ten\r\nthousand miles from our shores, and at a cost of four million dollars a\r\nweek, and at the sacrifice each year of thousands of the youth of\r\nAmerica, and the destruction of the health and happiness of tens of\r\nthousands more.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of President McKinley's administration, and such is\r\nthe defence offered by the representative of the county of Essex.\r\n\r\nThere may have been no sinister design in the attempt to demonstrate\r\nmy inconsistency upon a question of constitutional law.  I do not\r\nassume the existence of personal hostility.  An end would be answered\r\nif you and others could be induced to believe that in 1859 I had so\r\nconstrued the Constitution as to justify President McKinley in governing\r\nthe Philippine Islands as though the Constitution of the United States\r\ndid not exist.  Thus do my opinions receive more consideration from an\r\nopponent than they could command at the hands of a friend.\r\n\r\nI am now to speak more directly in explanation of the opinion that I\r\ngave in 1859, with something of the history of the circumstances\r\nwhich led to the preparation of the paper of that year.  It is an error\r\nto assume that the question whether or not the Constitution extends to\r\nthe Territories, was a prominent question, in the period of the anti-\r\nslavery controversy.  That question was not publicly and seriously\r\ndiscussed on either side.\r\n\r\nThe controversy was conducted upon the theory that the Territories were\r\nunder the Constitution.  The question was this:  Can a slaveholder move\r\nfrom a slave State to a Territory and be protected under the\r\nConstitution in holding his slaves as property?\r\n\r\nIt was the theory of the Missouri Compromise Measure of 1820 and it was\r\nthe theory of the compromise measures of 1850, that the Constitution\r\nneither authorized slavery anywhere nor prohibited it anywhere.  The\r\nKansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 recognized, as an admitted fact, the\r\ndoctrine that the Constitution extended to the Territories, and it\r\nasserted as a conclusion of law and as a public policy, the doctrine\r\nthat the Constitution \"should have the same force and effect within the\r\nTerritory of Kansas as elsewhere within the United States.\"  Thus it\r\nwas maintained by the friends of the compromise measures that the\r\nConstitution neither authorized slavery in the Territories nor\r\nprohibited it.  This view of the Constitution was accepted by the\r\nopponents of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution did not authorize slavery in the States nor did it\r\nprohibit slavery in the States.  Until the Dred Scott Decision, the\r\ncontroversy proceeded upon the idea that States and Territories were\r\nalike under the Constitution, and that by the Constitution slavery was\r\nneither authorized nor prohibited in any State, nor in any Territory of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as at that time slavery was not prohibited under the\r\nConstitution, there was a general agreement in the proposition that\r\nCongress might authorize slavery in the Territories and that Congress\r\nmight prohibit slavery in the Territories.  One party contended for its\r\nauthorization, the other party demanded its prohibition.  On this issue\r\nthe contest was made up.  From first to last the contest proceeded upon\r\nthe theory, on all sides admitted to be a true theory, that the\r\nConstitution of the United States, by its own force, applied to all the\r\nTerritories of the United States.  In that opinion I concurred.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Douglas concluded to become a Presidential candidate, he\r\nbroached a theory of constitutional interpretation for which he may\r\nhave found some support in the Dred Scott Decision.\r\n\r\nHis theory was this:  The Constitution so applies to the Territories\r\nthat they must take places as States in the American Union, and the\r\nConstitution also requires Congress to accept the Territories as States,\r\nand with such institutions as the Territories, when on their way to\r\nStatehood, might choose to establish.\r\n\r\nHence it was, that in the article in reply to Mr. Douglas, I made this\r\nstatement:  \"But now under the new political dispensation, these\r\nthirty million can have no opinion concerning the admission of States\r\nwhich may have established Catholicism, Mohammadanism, Polygamy or\r\neven Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI interrupt the course of my remarks to say that already in the\r\nPhilippines we are tolerating and supporting slavery and polygamy,\r\nand preparing the way for the organization of Catholic and Mohammedan\r\nStates, and their admission into the American Union.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1859, and in the article now under debate, that I used this\r\nlanguage as a fair exposition of Mr. Douglas' plans:\r\n\r\n\"The people of a Territory have all the rights of the people of a\r\nState; and therefore there are no Territories belonging to the\r\nAmerican Union, but all are by the silent negative operations of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, converted into independent sovereign\r\nmembers of the North American Confederacy.  We commend this system to\r\nthe advocates of popular sovereignty.  It offers many advantages.  It\r\nwill not be possible for the people or the Congress of the United States\r\nto resist the admission of new States, inasmuch as their consent will\r\nnot be asked.  It avoids all unpleasant issues.  It provides for new\r\nslave States; it disposes of Utah; it settles, in anticipation, all\r\nquestions that may grow out of the annexation of the Catholic Mexican\r\nStates; and it permits the immigrants from the Celestial Empire to\r\nre-establish their institutions, and take their places as members of\r\nthis Imperial Republic.\"  This statement of Mr. Douglas' policy in the\r\ninterest of slavery is not a far-away prophecy of the doings under\r\nPresident McKinley's administration.\r\n\r\nI have reached a point in this discussion when this remark may be\r\njustified:  No impartial reader of my article of 1859 can fail to\r\ndiscover that the discussion did not involve the question now raised.\r\nThe issue was this:  Are the Territories bound by the Constitution\r\nto become States in the American Union against the judgment of the\r\npeople, and are the existing States bound to accept a new State and\r\nthat without regard to its institutions?  This was the theory of Mr.\r\nDouglas, and it was a theory designed to provide a certain way for the\r\nincrease of slave States.  My argument was aimed at that policy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my article there is a summary by propositions which\r\ncontains declarations that were outside of the controversy with Mr.\r\nDouglas.\r\n\r\nOne of these has been quoted, and quoted in error as evidence of my\r\ninconsistency.  I read the proposition:  \"The Constitution of the United\r\nStates may be extended over a Territory by the treaty of annexation, or\r\nby a law of Congress, in which case it has only the authority of the\r\nlaw; but the Constitution by the force of its own provisions is limited\r\nto the people and the States of the American Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn this general proposition there are several minor and distinct\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\n1.  The Constitution may be extended over a territory by a treaty of\r\nannexation.  This is now my distinct claim in regard to Porto Rico and\r\nthe Philippines, a position that I have uniformly maintained.\r\n\r\n2.  The Constitution may be extended to a territory by law, _in which\r\ncase it has only the authority of law._\r\n\r\nAs to this statement I can only say I may have had in mind instances\r\nof such legislation as may be found in the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that the Constitution of its own force, applies to the\r\nTerritories, we refer to the parts that are applicable to the\r\nTerritories as distinguishable from the parts that relate to States\r\nexclusively.  It is a provision of the Constitution that\r\n\r\n\"No State shall make any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\"\r\n\r\nIn terms this limitation does not extend to Territories.  Congress\r\nmight extend the limitation, but the Act of limitation would have only\r\nthe force of law.\r\n\r\n3.  \"The Constitution by the force of its own provisions is limited\r\nto the _people_ and States of the American Union.\"  This is only a\r\ndeclaration that the Constitution does not apply to other states and\r\ncommunities.  The word _people_ includes the inhabitants of the\r\nTerritories as well as the inhabitants of the States.  If there could\r\nhave been a doubt in 1859 of the validity of this interpretation, the\r\ndoubt has been removed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The inhabitants\r\nof Territories are thereby made citizens of the United States, are\r\nbrought within the jurisdiction of the Constitution, and as citizens\r\nthey are put upon an equality with the citizens of the States.  They\r\nare of the _people_ of the American Union, and as such they are under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese are the opening words of the amendment:--\r\n\r\n\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of\r\nthe State wherein they reside.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no subject classes in America excepting only such as have been\r\ncreated, temporarily, as I trust, in Porto Rico and the Philippine\r\nIslands, by the policy of President McKinley, and all in violation of\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which reads thus:\r\n\r\n\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\ncrime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\nwithin the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley claimed jurisdiction over the Philippine Islands and\r\nconsequently the inhabitants are entitled to the benign protection of\r\nthis provision of the Constitution.  There cannot be any form of\r\ninvoluntary servitude imposed upon any American citizen without a\r\nviolation of this fundamental law.  Hence it is that the administration\r\nis forced to deny citizenship to the inhabitants of the Island and to\r\nassert the claim that the President and Congress may govern the\r\ninhabitants of territories acquired by purchase, as in the case of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, or by conquest, as in the case of Porto Rico, as\r\nthey might be governed if the Constitution did not exist.  And this,\r\nwe are told by the President and his supporters, is not imperialism, but\r\na process of extending the blessings of liberty and civilization to\r\nthe inferior races of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the President is the assertion of a right in Congress to\r\nestablish a system of peonage or even of slavery in Alaska, Hawaii,\r\nand the rest.  Your representative finds himself called to the defence\r\nof this doctrine.  Thus is the amendment to the Constitution made of\r\nno effect in the Territories.\r\n\r\nThe character of President McKinley's policy is set forth in his own\r\nwords and they justify the charge of imperialism.\r\n\r\nIn his speech of acceptance he said:--\"The Philippines are ours, and\r\nAmerican authority must be supreme throughout the Archipelago.  There\r\nwill be amnesty, broad and liberal, but no abatement of our rights, no\r\nabandonment of our duty; there must be no scuttle policy.\"  What is\r\nthe meaning of this language?  Is it not an assertion of absolute,\r\nunconditional, permanent supremacy over the millions of the islands?\r\n\r\nImperialism is not a word merely.  It is a public policy.\r\n\r\nThe President denounces imperialism, and with emphasis he declares that\r\nwe are all republicans in America.  None of us are imperialists.\r\n\r\nOur answer is this:  In the language that I have quoted the President\r\ndescribes himself as an imperialist.  The test of Republicanism is\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment.  The President is subjecting ten million\r\npeople to involuntary subserviency under his rule.  This, by whatever\r\nname called, is the imperialism that we denounce.\r\n\r\nWe denounce it as a violation of a provision of our Constitution that\r\nwas gained at the cost of the lives of four hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nWe denounce it as a violation of the rights of ten million human beings\r\nwho owe no allegiance to us.  Our title! you exclaim.  I answer, What\r\nis it?  A title to rule an unwilling, revolutionary people, who, at the\r\ntime our title was acquired, were demanding of Spain the enjoyment of\r\nthe right of self-government.  That right was well-nigh gained when we\r\naccepted the place of substitute for Spain.  Through twenty months of\r\nwar we have been engaged in a fruitless attempt to subjugate our\r\npurchased victims, and we have been cajoled, continually, by the\r\ndeclaration that the war was ended.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the theory of the President that our title to Porto Rico\r\nand the Philippines is a good title, then that title can be exercised\r\nand enjoyed only in one of two ways under our Constitution and the\r\nexample that has been set in the case of Cuba.  They should be held as\r\nTerritories, on the way to Statehood, or as possessions entitled to\r\nself-government without delay by us.  Mr. McKinley, Senator Lodge and\r\nMr. Moody say neither way is acceptable--the lands and the people are\r\nours.  They have no rights under the Constitution.  We will hold them\r\nsubject to our will until they accept our authority and recognize our\r\nright to rule over them, and beyond that we will hold them until, in\r\nour opinion, they are qualified to govern themselves.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of imperialism is again set forth in the President's\r\nletter of acceptance of September 8.  \"The flag of the Republic now\r\nfloats over these islands as an emblem of rightful sovereignty.  Will\r\nthe Republic stay and dispense to their inhabitants the blessings of\r\nliberty, education and free institutions, or steal away, leaving them\r\nto anarchy or imperialism?\"\r\n\r\nThus the President is engaged in dispensing liberty to conquered peoples\r\ninstead of allowing them to enjoy liberty as a birthright.  He is\r\ndispensing to them such education as he thinks they ought to have,\r\ninstead of allowing them to decide for themselves as to the education\r\nwhich may be agreeable or useful for them.  He dictates for them the\r\n\"free institutions\" which in his opinion are best adapted to their\r\ncondition, instead of allowing them the freedom to choose their own\r\ninstitutions.  Thus the President assumes authority to furnish systems\r\nof education and institutions of government by force, denying to the\r\npeople all freedom of action for themselves, and thereupon he declares\r\nthat \"empire has been expelled from Porto Rico and the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\nCan the President show wherein his policy, in principle, differs from\r\nthe policy of Spain?\r\n\r\nSpain was engaged in war to compel the Filipinos to accept Spanish\r\ninstitutions of education and liberty.  We are attempting through war\r\nto compel the Filipinos to accept American institutions of education and\r\nliberty.  It is not an answer to say, what may be true, that American\r\nideas and systems of education are superior to Spanish ideas and\r\nsystems.  In each case there is compulsion.  In each case there is a\r\ndenial of freedom.  In each case, there is the same exercise of power.\r\nIn each case there is the same demand for a subservient class.  In each\r\ncase there is gross undisguised imperialism.  The difference is to the\r\nadvantage of Spain.  Spain was consistent.  Her policy was a policy of\r\nimperialism;--a policy of centuries.\r\n\r\nAmerica was a republic.  Self-government was at the basis of all her\r\ninstitutions.  It was a prominent feature of her history.  Our\r\naccusation against President McKinley is this:  He turned away from the\r\nhistory of America, he disdained our traditions, and he reversed the\r\npolicy of a century.\r\n\r\nMark the consequences of the change.  In other days we sympathized with\r\nGreece in its struggle for self-government; we denounced the suppression\r\nof liberty in Hungary, and in the opening years of this century we\r\nwelcomed the provinces of Central and South America as they emerged,\r\none by one, from a condition of imperial vassalage, and took their\r\nplaces in the galaxy of Republican States.\r\n\r\nIf in this year 1900, America had sent forth one word of official cheer\r\nto the States of South Africa, the act would have been an act of self-\r\nabasement that would have invited the contempt of all mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen we charge imperialism upon the administration this question is put\r\nexultingly:  \"Where is the crown?\"  I answer from history.  England\r\nwaited a century, after the conquests by Clive and Hastings, for a\r\nBeaconsfield to crown Britain's Queen \"Empress of the Indies.\"  The\r\ncrown is but a bauble.  Empire means vast armies employed in ignominious\r\nservice, burdensome taxation at home, and ruthless maladministration of\r\naffairs abroad.\r\n\r\nIn two short years of imperialism, these evils have ceased to be\r\nimaginative merely, and they have taken a place among the unwelcome\r\nrealities of our national life.\r\n\r\nBefore I close this discourse I shall return to the subject that I have\r\nnow introduced to your attention, and for the purpose of asking you to\r\nfoster and preserve the quality of consistency in the history of the\r\ncounty of Essex.\r\n\r\nMr. Moody introduced two topics to the Essex Club of which I am to take\r\nnotice.  They concern me personally, but there is an aspect of one of\r\nthem that may merit public attention.\r\n\r\nWith a kindliness of spirit, that I could not have anticipated, Mr.\r\nMoody attributes my failure to continue in the opinions that he claims\r\nwere entertained by me in 1859, to the infirmities incident to advancing\r\nyears.  He thus raises a question that I am not competent to discuss.\r\nI pass it by.\r\n\r\nI trust that Mr. Moody may live to the age of two and eighty years; that\r\nhis experience may be more fortunate than the fate that he attributes\r\nto me, and that at that advanced period of his life his ability to\r\ninterpret the Constitution of his country will not be less than it now\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Mr. Moody, as it appears in the _Transcript_ of August\r\n30, closes with this sentence:  \"He at least might spare the epithets\r\nto the party that has showered upon him every honor within its gift,\r\nexcept the presidency.\"  If I have applied any disparaging epithet to\r\nthe Republican Party, my error is due to my ignorance of the meaning of\r\nthe word.  The quotations which Mr. Moody has made from my speech at the\r\nCooper Institute contain a declaration in two forms of expression, which\r\nmay have led Mr. Moody to charge me with the use of epithets.  I find\r\nnothing else on which this allegation can be founded.  I reproduce the\r\nquotations:\r\n\r\n\"President McKinley and his imperialistic supporters through two steps\r\nin an argument have deduced an erroneous conclusion from admitted\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\n\"(1) Our government in common with other sovereignties has a right to\r\nacquire territory.\r\n\r\n\"(2) That right carries with it the right to govern territory so\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n\"From these propositions they deduce the false conclusion that Congress\r\nmay indulge a full and free discretion in the government of the\r\nterritories so acquired.  Herein is the error, and herein is the\r\nusurpation.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, \"We have the right to acquire territory and we have the right to\r\ngovern all territory acquired, but we must govern it under the\r\nConstitution, and in the exercise of those powers, and those only, which\r\nhave been conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.  Any attempt\r\nfurther is a criminal usurpation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first quotation I make the charge that President McKinley, in his\r\nattempt to govern the Philippine Islands as though the Constitution did\r\nnot apply to them, was exercising powers not granted to him by virtue\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\nThe President is the creature of the Constitution, and his jurisdiction\r\nis measured and limited by the jurisdiction of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen the President asserts that the Philippine Islands are not under the\r\nConstitution, he admits that the Philippine Islands are not within his\r\njurisdiction.  If, on the other hand, the islands are within his\r\njurisdiction, it follows that his right of jurisdiction over them must\r\nhave come from the presence of the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nLet there be no misunderstanding upon one point.  I claim that the\r\nPhilippine Islands are under the Constitution and that the President\r\nmay exercise in and over the islands whatever powers the Constitution\r\nand the laws may have placed in his hands.\r\n\r\nI claim further that as a right on the part of the Filipinos, and as a\r\npolicy of justice and wisdom on our part, we should relinquish our\r\ntitle, whatever it may be, and allow the Filipinos to enter upon the\r\nwork of governing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe President sets up the doctrine that the islands are not under the\r\nConstitution and that they may be governed by him outside of all\r\nconstitutional restraints.  This is the usurpation that I have charged\r\nupon him, but not upon the Republican Party of former days.  Upon the\r\nbasis specified the charge remains.  It is not an epithet.  Let the\r\ncharge be answered, or otherwise, let the President and the supporters\r\nof his policy abandon the doctrine that we can seize, hold and govern\r\ncommunities and peoples who are not within the jurisdiction of our\r\nConstitution and, who, consequently, are not subject to our laws.\r\n\r\nI have said that the President and his supporters are imperialists.  If\r\nthe word is descriptive of a policy then the word is not an epithet.\r\n\r\nIn the passage that I have quoted from the speech of Mr. Moody he\r\ncharges me in fact, if not in form of words, with a violation of my\r\nobligations to the Republican Party, and upon the ground that the party\r\n\"has showered upon me every honor in its gift except the Presidency.\"\r\nThe consideration that I have received from the Republican Party merits\r\nacknowledgment, and that I accord without reserve, but it cannot exact\r\nsubserviency from me.\r\n\r\nOn public grounds I ask this question:  Are those who may hold office\r\nunder the leadership of a party, to be held by party discipline to the\r\nsupport of measures and policies which they condemn?  Freedom of opinion\r\nand freedom of speech are of more value than public office.  The\r\nmovement for the reform of the civil service is, in its best aspect,\r\nbut an attempt to rescue the body of office holders from the tyranny\r\nand discipline of party and of party leaders.  Thus much upon public\r\ngrounds, but, for myself, I shall not seek protection under a general\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nNever for a moment from my early years did I entertain the thought that\r\nI would enter public life, or that I would continue in public life, as\r\na pursuit or as a profession.  Hence, it has happened that I have never\r\nasked for personal support at the hands of any, and hence it has\r\nhappened that I have never solicited a nomination or an appointment from\r\nor through the Republican Party or any member of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, a majority of the delegates to the Congressional Convention in\r\nmy district, favored my nomination, but not through any effort by me.\r\nI attended the Convention and placed in nomination Mr. Train, who had\r\nbeen in Congress one term.\r\n\r\nWithout any effort on my part I was nominated in 1862-'64-'66 and '68.\r\nNo aid in money or otherwise was given by the State Committee or the\r\nNational Committee.  Following my nomination in each case the District\r\nCommittee asked me for a contribution of one hundred dollars.  On one\r\noccasion the committee sent me a return check of forty-two dollars and\r\nsome cents with a statement that the full amount had not been expended.\r\nIf contributions of money were made by others the fact was not\r\ncommunicated to me.\r\n\r\nI became a candidate for the Senate upon a request signed by members of\r\nthe Legislature.  When the second contest was on, in 1877, I declined\r\na call by a telegraphic message to visit Boston and confer with my\r\nfriends who were anxious for my election.  I was a member of the Peace\r\nCongress of 1861 and I received several other appointments from Governor\r\nAndrew, but without solicitation by me.  At his request I went to\r\nWashington for a conference with Mr. Lincoln and General Scott.  I\r\nreached the city by the first train that passed over the road from\r\nAnnapolis.  Again, at his request, I went to Washington the Monday\r\nfollowing the battle of Bull Run.\r\n\r\nI received two appointments from President Lincoln, when, in each case,\r\nI had no knowledge that the place existed.\r\n\r\nFrom General Grant I received the offer of the Interior Department and\r\nthen of the Treasury Department, both of which I declined.  When\r\nGeneral Grant had taken the responsibility of sending my name to the\r\nSenate, I had no alternative as a member of the Republican Party and\r\nas a friend to General Grant.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. Folger, President Arthur asked me to take the\r\noffice of Secretary of the Treasury.  I was then concerned with the\r\naffairs of another government and I declined the appointment.\r\n\r\nWhen General Garfield had been nominated at Chicago in 1880 the\r\nnomination of a candidate for the Vice-Presidency was placed in the\r\nhands of the friends of General Grant.  That nomination was offered to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn the forty years from 1856 to 1896, I made speeches in behalf of the\r\nRepublican Party in Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois,\r\nOhio and Indiana and in no instance did I receive compensation for my\r\nservices.  When I spoke in Ohio my expenses were paid on all occasions\r\nbut one.  That was a volunteer visit.  My acquaintance with the\r\npoliticians of Ohio was agreeable from first to last.\r\n\r\nIn my many trips through New York it was understood that my expenses\r\nwere to be paid.  When General Arthur was at the head of the committee\r\nhis checks exceeded the expenses, perhaps by a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the State Committee asked me to make six or eight\r\nspeeches upon their appointment.  That service I performed; whether my\r\nexpenses were paid I cannot say.  If they were paid it is the exception\r\nin Massachusetts, unless local expenses may have been met where\r\naddresses were made.\r\n\r\nIf a mercantile account current could be written, it might appear that\r\nmy obligations to the Republican Party are not in excess of the\r\nobligations of the Republican Party to me.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience as a member of the Republican Party I add an incident\r\nto what I have said already.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1862, and at the request of President Lincoln and\r\nSecretary Chase, I entered upon the work of organizing the Internal\r\nRevenue Office.  That work was continued without the interruption of\r\nSabbaths or evenings, with a few exceptions only, till March, 1863,\r\nwhen, as was said by Mr. Chase, the office was larger than the entire\r\nTreasury had been at any time previous to 1861.  It was the largest\r\nbranch of government ever organized in historical times and set in\r\nmotion in a single year.  The system remains undisturbed.  Such changes\r\nonly have been made as were required by changes in the laws.  In the\r\nthirty-eight years of its existence the Government has received through\r\nits agency the enormous sum of five thousand and five hundred million\r\ndollars being twice the amount of all the revenues of the Government\r\nprevious to 1860.\r\n\r\nI have thus devoted many minutes of your time to the questions raised by\r\nMr. Moody.\r\n\r\nThe nature and the extent of my obligations to the Republican Party\r\nand the question of my consistency in the construction that I have\r\ngiven to the Constitution of the United States, are not matters of\r\ngrave concern for you.  They have come into the field of discussion\r\nthrough the agency of Mr. Moody.\r\n\r\nI come now to ask your attention to a view of your relations to passing\r\nevents which concerns the county of Essex.\r\n\r\nYour county has a distinguished history--distinguished for its men and\r\nfor its part in public affairs.  Shall the history that you are now\r\nmaking be consistent with that which you have inherited and which you\r\ncherish?  I mention one name only among your great names and I bring\r\nbefore your minds one event only.\r\n\r\nIn the order of time and in the order of events, the second most\r\nimportant paper in the annals of America is the \"Ordinance for the\r\nGovernment of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the\r\nRiver Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief value of that ordinance is in the sixth article which is in\r\nthese words:  \"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\nin the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crime,\r\nwhereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nBy repeated decisions the Supreme Court has held that the stipulations\r\nand terms of the ordinance remained in force after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, unless a conflict should appear, and in such a case the\r\nordinance would yield to the Constitution.  As the article in regard\r\nto slavery was not controlled by the Constitution, the exclusion of\r\nslavery became the supreme and continuing law of the Territories and\r\nStates that were organized in the vast region covered by the Ordinance\r\nof 1787, and it may be assumed, fairly, that the character and power of\r\nthose States made possible the extermination of the institution of\r\nslavery in all parts of the country.  The parties to the ordinance of\r\n1787 may have builded better than they knew, but their work is one of\r\nthe four great acts or events in the history of the Republic--The\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the Ordinance of 1787, the Constitution,\r\nand the amendment abolishing the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nNathan Dane of the county of Essex, was the author of the Ordinance of\r\n1787; and he was a delegate in the Continental Congress from 1785 to\r\n1788.  Of all the eminent men that you have sent forth into the service\r\nof the State and the country, he must be accounted the chief, when we\r\nconsider the value of his contribution, historically, and on the side of\r\nfreedom and civilization.  His fame is in your hands and I have come to\r\nask you to consider whether the policy of President McKinley in the\r\nPhilippines is in harmony with the Ordinance of 1787 and the amendment\r\nto the Constitution of 1865.\r\n\r\nBy the Ordinance of 1787, freedom and full right to self-government\r\nwere made secure to the coming millions who were to occupy the States\r\nnorthwest of the River Ohio.  By the amendment of 1865 freedom and\r\nequality in government were guaranteed to all and especially to the\r\nnegro race in America.\r\n\r\nShall the avoidance of the Amendment in States of this Union be tendered\r\nas a reason for a denial of equality and the right of self-government in\r\nthe Philippine Islands?  If the negroes in America are entitled to\r\nfreedom from a state of subserviency, are not the colored races in the\r\nPhilippines entitled to freedom, and that whether they are under the\r\nConstitution or beyond its jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nYou are called to a choice between the doctrines of Nathan Dane and\r\nAbraham Lincoln on one side and the doctrines and policy of President\r\nMcKinley and his supporters on the other side.  The point I make is\r\nthis:  The three propositions cannot stand together.  Dane and Lincoln\r\nare in harmony.  They guaranteed equality and self-government to all.\r\nPresident McKinley and his supporters demand subserviency of all who\r\nare not within the lines of the American seas.\r\n\r\nThey assert supreme authority over their fellow-men for an indefinite\r\nperiod of time, and they promise therewith good government.  Here are\r\nthe assertion of power and the promise of goodness that have attended\r\nthe origin and movement of every despotism that has risen to curse\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThat you may see, as in one view, the doctrines of Dane, Lincoln and\r\nMcKinley, I read again the records that they have made.\r\n\r\n\"There shall be neither slavery       \"The Philippines are ours and\r\nnor involuntary servitude in the      American authority must be su-\r\nsaid territory otherwise than in the  preme throughout the Archipelago.\r\npunishment of crimes whereof the      There will be amnesty, broad and\r\nparty shall have been duly            liberal, but no abatement of our\r\nconvicted.\"--NATHAN DANE.             rights, no abandonment of our\r\n                                      duty.
