No. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nHENRY BROUGHAM, LORD BROUGHAM AND VAUX.\r\nFROM A SKETCH BY ALFRED CROWQUILL, MADE IN JULY, 1850.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BROUGHAM.\r\n\r\nIt is generally understood that this most illustrious Englishman now\r\nliving, will, in the course of the present year, visit the United States.\r\nWhatever may be the verdict of the future upon his qualities or his\r\nconduct as a statesman, it is scarcely to be doubted that for the variety\r\nand splendor of his abilities, the extent, diversity and usefulness of\r\nhis labors, and that restless, impatient and feverish activity which has\r\nkept him so long and so eminently conspicuous in affairs, he will be\r\nregarded by the next ages as one of the most remarkable personages in the\r\nage now closing--the second golden age of England. Lord Brougham is of a\r\nCumberland family, but was born in Edinburgh (where his father had\r\nmarried a niece of the historian Robertson), on the 19th of September,\r\n1779. He was educated at the University of his native city, and we first\r\nhear of him as a member of a celebrated debating society, where he\r\ntrained himself to the use of logic. He was not yet sixteen years of age\r\nwhen he communicated a paper on Light to the Royal Society of London,\r\nwhich was printed in their transactions; and before he was twenty he had\r\nwritten discussions of the higher geometry, which, appearing  in the same\r\nrepository of the best learning, attracted the general attention of\r\nEuropean scholars. In 1802, with his friends Jeffrey, Francis Homer, and\r\nSidney Smith, he established the Edinburgh Review. In 1806 he published\r\nhis celebrated \"Inquiry into the Colonial Policy of the European Powers,\"\r\nand soon after was called to the English bar, and settled in London,\r\nwhere he rapidly rose to the highest eminence as a counselor and an\r\nadvocate. On the 16th of March, 1808, he appeared in behalf of the\r\nmerchants of London, Liverpool, Manchester, &c., before the House of\r\nCommons, in the matter of the Orders in Council restricting trade with\r\nAmerica, and greatly increased his fame by one of the most masterly\r\narguments he ever delivered. In 1810 he became a member of Parliament,\r\nand he soon distinguished himself here by his speeches on the slave trade\r\nand against the Orders in Council, which, mainly through his means, were\r\nrescinded. Venturing, at the general election of 1812, to contest the\r\nseat for Liverpool with Mr. Canning, he was defeated, and for four years\r\nhe devoted himself chiefly to his profession. In this period he made many\r\nof his most famous law arguments, and acquired the enmity of the Prince\r\nRegent by his defense of Leigh Hunt, and his brother, in the case of\r\ntheir famous libel in \"_The Examiner_.\" In 1816 he commenced those\r\npowerful and indefatigable efforts in behalf of education, by which he is\r\nperhaps best entitled to the gratitude of mankind. As chairman of the\r\neducational committee of forty, he drew up the two voluminous and\r\nmasterly reports which disclosed the exact condition of British\r\ncivilization, and induced such action on the part of government as\r\nadvanced it in ten years more than it had been previously advanced in a\r\ncentury. In 1820 he displayed in their perfection those amazing powers of\r\nknowledge, reason, invective, sarcasm, and elocution, on the trial of\r\nQueen Caroline, which more than anything else have made\r\nthat trial so memorable among legal and forensic conflicts. In 1822 he\r\nmade his unparalleled speech in the case of the Dean and Chapter of\r\nDurham against Williams, and in the following year was elected Lord\r\nRector of the University of Glasgow. On the downfall of the Wellington\r\nadministration, in 1830, and the consequent general election, he was\r\nreturned to Parliament as one of the members for Yorkshire, and a few\r\nweeks afterward was made Lord High. Chancellor, and elevated to the\r\npeerage under the title of Lord Brougham and Vaux. He continued in the\r\noffice of Lord Chancellor until the dissolution of the Melbourne cabinet,\r\nin 1834. In 1823 he wrote his \"Practical Observations on the Education of\r\nthe People,\" and was engaged with Dr. Birkbeck in the formation of the\r\nfirst Mechanics' Institution. In 1827 he was one of the originators of\r\nthe London University, and in the same year he founded the Society for\r\nthe Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, of which he was the first president,\r\nand for which he wrote its first publication, the admirable \"Treatise on\r\nthe Objects, Pleasures, and Advantages of Science.\" In 1830 he was\r\nelected a member of the Institute of France, and about the time of his\r\nresignation of the chancellorship he published his \"Discourse on Natural\r\nTheology.\" In 1840 he published his \"Historical Sketches of the Statesmen\r\nwho flourished in the Time of George the Third;\" in 1845-6, \"Lives of Men\r\nof Letters and Science who flourished in the Time of George the Third;\"\r\nand he has since given to the world works on \"The French Revolution,\" on\r\n\"Instinct,\" \"Demosthenes' Oration on the Crown,\" &c., &c. Collections  of\r\nhis Speeches and Forensic Arguments, and of his Critical Essays, as well\r\nas the other works above referred to, have been republished in\r\nPhiladelphia, by Lea and Blanchard.\r\n\r\nIn the language of the Editor of his \"Opinions\", Lord Brougham is\r\nremarkable for uniting, in a high degree of perfection, three things\r\nwhich are not often found to be compatible. His learning is all but\r\nuniversal: his reason is cultivated to the perfection of the\r\nargumentative powers; and he possesses in a rare and eminent degree the\r\ngift of eloquence.\r\n\r\nOf his learning it may be said that there is scarcely a subject, on which\r\ningenuity or intellect has been exercised, that he has not probed to its\r\nprinciples, or entered into with the spirit of a philosopher. That he is\r\na classical scholar of a high order, is shown by his criticisms on the\r\ninternal peculiarities of the works of the ancients and their styles of\r\ncomposition. They evince an intimate acquaintance with the great master\r\npieces of antiquity. The book-worms of Universities--those scholastic\r\ngiants who are great on small questions of quantity and etymology,--who\r\nbuckle on the ponderous armor of the commentators in the contest with\r\nmore subtle wits, on the interesting doubt of a wrong reading; such men,\r\nin the spirit of pedantry, have refused to Lord Brougham the merit of\r\nprofundity, while they allow that he possesses a sort of superficial\r\nknowledge of the classics; they say that he can gracefully skim the\r\nsurface of the stream, but that its depths would overwhelm him. Now,\r\nwhile this may be true as regards the fact, we dissent from it as regards\r\nthe inference. It is a question to be decided between the learned drones\r\nof a by-gone school and the quicker intellects of a ripening age, which\r\nis the better thing,--criticism on words--on accidental peculiarities of\r\nstyle--or a just and sympathizing conception of the feelings of the poet\r\nor the wisdom of the philosopher. Men are beginning to disregard the\r\nformer, while they set a high value upon the latter: so much\r\nlaboriously-earned learning is at a discount, and allowance should be\r\nmade for the petty spite, the depreciating superciliousness, of\r\ndisappointment. Lord Brougham's classical knowledge partakes more of that\r\nintimate regard and appreciation which we accord to the great writers,\r\nthan of this pedantry of the schools. Hence the cry of want of depth,\r\nthat has been raised against him. Like many other great men of his age,\r\nhe has read the authors of Greece and Rome in a spirit that has\r\nidentified him with their thoughts and feelings, by taking into account\r\nthe circumstances of their times; and the result has been, that he has\r\nexchanged the formalities and critical sharp-sightedness of acquaintance\r\nfor the intimacy of friendship.\r\n\r\nIn point of general political knowledge, and particularly of that branch\r\ncalled political  economy, Lord Brougham stands prominently among his\r\ncontemporaries. In his speeches and writings will be found the first\r\nprinciples of every new view of these subjects that has been taken by the\r\nmoderns. Of not a few he has himself been the originator. In the party\r\nhistory of the last century he is well versed, as many of his speeches\r\nshow; and no public man of the present day is so well acquainted with the\r\ntheory and practice of the constitution, whether as regards the broad\r\nprinciples of liberty on which it is based, or its gradual formation\r\nduring the different periods of our history. It may not be amiss here to\r\nobserve, that notwithstanding his long connection with the movement\r\nparty, and the countenance he has from time to time given to measures of\r\na decidedly liberal cast, he never was, and is still as far from being, a\r\nDemocrat. Throughout his career he has been a consistent Liberal: always\r\nadvocating such measures of reform as were calculated to remove abuses,\r\nwhile they in no way affected the stability and integrity of the\r\ninstitutions of the country. While, on the one hand, he has declared his\r\nmost unequivocal opposition to the ballot and universal suffrage, on the\r\nother he has advocated popular education, as the ultimate panacea for all\r\nthe evils to be feared from the extension of popular influence.\r\n\r\nThe legal knowledge of Lord Brougham has been questioned by the members\r\nof the profession whose abuses he desired to reform. It was even said,\r\nthat while his elevation to the Chancellorship was the unjustifiable act\r\nof a party to serve party purposes, it was at the same time desirable to\r\nMr. Brougham in a pecuniary point of view, from a falling off in his\r\nprofessional practice, caused by his hostility to those abuses. Now,\r\nalthough this is a question really of more interest to lawyers, than to\r\nthe public in general, and one which might, therefore, be left to their\r\ndecision, yet there was an _animus_ at the time among this class of men,\r\nthat rendered them not disinterested judges. Their opinion therefore must\r\nbe taken with a qualification, as well on the score of particular\r\nimmediate drawbacks, as on the score of their general professional\r\nprejudices. Lord Brougham respected too much the principles of justice,\r\nand he too little regarded the technicalities of law, to be agreeable to\r\nthat body. He had a faculty too, for giving speedy judgments, and a\r\ndetermination to prevent unnecessary expenses, that were particularly\r\ndisagreeable to men imbued with a conscientious desire that justice\r\nshould not be prejudiced by an unprecedented and informal haste in its\r\ndispensation, or by a reduction of the number of its advocates. The new\r\nLord Chancellor, too, thought that when one or two intelligent barristers\r\nhad been engaged at a large expense, and had well stated the case of\r\ntheir client, it was quite unnecessary that the same ground should be\r\nagain gone over by juniors, whose arguments marred more than they helped\r\nthe interests of their employers. When, therefore, he either put them\r\ndown, or was droned into a short nap, while the industrious advocate was\r\nearning his unnecessary fee, it was a specimen of \"the arrogance of an\r\nupstart wholly unacquainted with Chancery Law,\" or \"of an eccentricity\r\nbordering on insanity, and wholly unfitting its exhibitor for the high\r\nand responsible situation he held.\" Posterity will do justice to Lord\r\nBrougham in this respect. It will be felt to have been impossible that a\r\nman of such vast acquirements, who had been so successful in his\r\nprofession, and who had, in all other branches of knowledge, evinced such\r\nclearness of intellect, could have been the inefficient lawyer his\r\ndetractors have represented him to be.\r\n\r\nThere is another great department in which he has proved his\r\nexcellence--that of physical science. With the principles of all the\r\nsciences, his works show him to be familiar. His treatise \"on the\r\nObjects, Pleasures, and Advantages of Science\" is admirable, as a\r\nbird's-eye view of the subject, while at the same time it is an enticing\r\nstimulant to study. The work on \"Natural Theology\" necessarily touches\r\nupon the physical sciences, and their connection with the great mechanism\r\nof nature. The geometrical and optical papers, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, when he was only fifteen\r\nyears of age, show at least a firm groundwork of scientific knowledge.\r\nAnd if it be said that Lord Brougham's attainments are superficial only,\r\nwe say that knowledge of detail does not of itself make a man competent.\r\nThe _principles_ of all sciences are a _sine qua non_.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham is eminently clear-headed; and he is distinguished for his\r\nargumentative powers. He has peculiarly the faculty of analysis; that of\r\nkeeping in his own mind a comprehensive view of the whole bearings of a\r\nquestion, even while running at large into the minutest details; no man\r\ndetects the fallacy  of an opponent's argument more easily; nor can any\r\nman be more skillful in concocting a fallacy to suit a temporary purpose.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham's eloquence most distinguishes him from his contemporaries.\r\nLearning may be acquired; the habit of reasoning may be induced by\r\nconstant dialectic contest; but eloquence is far more than these the gift\r\nof nature. Lord Brougham's eloquence savors of the peculiar constitution\r\nof his mind. It is eminently adapted for educated men. He was never\r\nintended for a demagogue; for he never condescends to the art of\r\npandering to the populace. His speeches are specimens of argumentative\r\neloquence; and their only defect arises from his fertility of\r\nillustration. The extraordinary information he possesses has induced the\r\nhabit of drawing too largely upon it; and he is apt to be led aside from\r\nthe straight road of his argument, to elucidate some minor disputed\r\npoint. But the argumentative style of which we speak is almost peculiar\r\nto himself. There is a ripeness, a fruitfulness, in his mind, that places\r\nhim above the fetters of ordinary speakers. Such men, from the difficulty\r\nof clearing their heads for the contest, too often present a mere\r\nfleshless skeleton, as it were, very convincing to the judgment, but\r\npowerless over the feelings; so that no lasting impression is produced.\r\nBut Lord Brougham, from being a master in argument, is free to pursue his\r\nbent in illustration, and thus conjures up a whole picture that dwells on\r\nthe mind, and is remembered for its effect on the feelings or the\r\nimagination, even by men whose levity or dullness precluded their being\r\nfixed by the argument. The very structure of his sentences is more\r\nadapted for this kind of speaking than any other. They sometimes appear\r\ninvolved, to an ordinary mind, from their length, and the abundance of\r\nillustration and explanation which they embrace; but the extraordinary\r\nvigor with which the delivery is kept up, and the liveliness of fancy or\r\nof humor that flashes at every turn of the thought, soon dispel the\r\ntemporary cloud.\r\n\r\nIn irony and in sarcasm, Lord Brougham is unrivaled among the public men\r\nof the day. That his exuberant power of ridicule led him while Lord\r\nChancellor, into some excess of its use, cannot be denied, although a\r\nready excuse can be found in the circumstances of his situation. He might\r\nbe held to be the representative of liberal principles in a place where\r\nalmost the name of Liberal had, till then, been proscribed; and the\r\nanimosity toward  the new Chancellor, evinced by many peers, was\r\ncalculated to induce reprisals. The eccentricities, too, of men of genius\r\nare of such value that they may well be said to atone for themselves.\r\n\r\nA quality of Lord Brougham's mind, that is almost as extraordinary as his\r\nextent of information, is its singular activity. His energies never seem\r\nto flag--even for an instant; he does not seem to know what it is to be\r\nfatigued, or jaded. Some such quality as this, indeed, the vastness and\r\nuniversality of his acquirements called for, in order to make the weight\r\nendurable to himself, and to bear him up during his long career of\r\npolitical excitement. Take the routine of a day for instance. In his\r\nearly life he has been known to attend, in his place in court, on\r\ncircuit, at an early hour in the morning. After having successfully\r\npleaded the cause of his client, he drives off to the hustings; and\r\ndelivers, at different places, eloquent speeches to the electors. He then\r\nsits in the retirement of his closet to pen an address to the Glasgow\r\nstudents, perhaps, or an elaborate article in the Edinburgh Review. The\r\nactive labors of the day are closed with preparation for the court\r\nbusiness of the following morning; and then instead of retiring to rest,\r\nas ordinary men would, after such exertions, he spends the night in\r\nabstruse study, or in social intercourse. Yet he would be seen as early\r\nas eight next morning, actively engaged in the Court, in defense of some\r\nunfortunate object of government persecution; astonishing the auditory,\r\nand his fellow lawyers no less, with the freshness and power of his\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nA fair contrast with this history of a day, in early life, would be that\r\nof one at a more advanced period; say in 1832. A watchful observer might\r\nsee the Lord Chancellor in the Court over which he presided, from an\r\nearly hour in the morning until the afternoon, listening to the arguments\r\nof counsel, and mastering the points of cases with a grasp that enabled\r\nhim to give those speedy and unembarrassed judgments that have so injured\r\nhim with the profession. If he followed his course, he would see him,\r\nsoon after the opening of the House of Lords, addressing their Lordships\r\non some intricate question of Law, with an acuteness that drew\r\napprobation even from his opponents, or, on some all-engrossing political\r\ntopic, casting firebrands into the camp of the enemy, and awakening them\r\nfrom the complacent repose of conviction to the hot contest with more\r\nactive and inquiring intellects. Then, in an hour or so, he might follow\r\nhim to the Mechanics' Institution, and hear an able and stimulating\r\ndiscourse on education, admirably adapted to the peculiar capacity of\r\nhis auditors; and, toward ten perhaps, at a Literary and Scientific\r\nInstitution in Marylebone, the same Proteus-like intellect might be found\r\nexpounding the intricacies of physical science with a never tiring and\r\nelastic power. Yet, during all these multitudinous exertions, time would\r\nbe found for the composition of a discourse on Natural Theology,\r\nthat bears no marks of haste or excitement of mind, but presents as calm\r\na face as though it had been the laborious production of a contemplative\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great mistake that would suppose the man who has thus\r\nmultiplied the objects of his exertion to be of necessity superficial;\r\nsuperficial, that is, in the sense of shallowness or ignorance. Ordinary\r\nminds are bound by fetters, no doubt. Custom has rendered the pursuit of\r\nmore than one idea all but impossible to them, and the vulgar adage of\r\n\"Jack of all trades, master of none,\" applies to them in full force. But\r\nit must be remembered that a public man like Lord Brougham, who has\r\nchosen his peculiar sphere of action, and who prefers being of general\r\nutility to the scholar-like pursuit of any one branch of science\r\nexclusively, is not bound to present credentials of full and perfect\r\nmastership, such as are required from a professor of a university. His\r\npursuit of facts must of necessity be for the purpose of illustrating\r\ngeneral principles in political or moral science; and where more than a\r\ncertain  amount of knowledge is not laid claim to, the absence of more is\r\nno imputation.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham is thoroughly individualized as regards his talents and all\r\nthat constitutes idiosyncratic difference, even while he is identified\r\nwith the political and moral advancement of the people. During all the\r\nagitations of a period almost unparalleled, he has remained untainted by\r\nthe influence of party spirit. That he has entered, and hotly too, into\r\nalmost every question of any moment that has come before the Legislature\r\nduring many years is true; but he has never appeared in the character of\r\na partisan; he has always been the consistent supporter of liberal\r\nmeasures _per se_, and not because they were the means adopted by a party\r\nto gain political power. With his political steadfastness he has\r\npreserved his intellectual integrity from profanation. For although, had\r\nhe early devoted his powers to the study of abstract or practical\r\nscience, as a leading and not a subsidiary pursuit, the acuteness of his\r\nmind was such, that he must have risen to eminence upon the basis of\r\ndiscovery, yet it is no slight proof how little the struggles of the\r\nworld affect superior intellects, that he has all along turned aside,\r\nwith a never cloying  avidity, to the pursuits of mind--to science, to\r\nliterature, and to philosophy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE LADY.\r\n\r\nThe readers of _The International_ may have seen some account of an\r\napparition said to have been seen recently in the royal palace at Berlin,\r\nand known under the name of the \"White Lady.\" M. Minutoli, lately chief\r\nof the Police at Berlin, has been amusing himself by looking up the\r\nhistory of this visitant from the unknown world, and has published a\r\nvariety of curious particulars respecting her, drawn in a measure from\r\ndocuments preserved in the royal archives, as well as from old-time\r\nchronicles and dissertations, Latin and German middle age doggerel, and\r\nthe records of jurists, historians and theologists. Several persons are\r\ndesignated in the early history of the family of Hohenzollern as that\r\nunquiet soul who for some three hundred years has performed the functions\r\nof palace-ghost. Many writers agree that she was a Countess named\r\nOrlamünde, Beatrice, or Cunigunde, and that she was desperately in love\r\nwith Count Albert of Nuremberg, and was led by her passion to a crime\r\nwhich is the cause of her subsequent ghostly disquiet. Mr. Minutoli\r\nproves that this lady cannot be the same that alarms the palace with her\r\nuntimely visitations. The accounts of the White Lady ascend to 1486, and\r\nshe was first seen at Baireuth. Subsequently two ghosts were heard of,\r\none white and one black. They were several times boldly interrogated and\r\ninteresting discoveries arrived at. In 1540, Count Albert the Warrior\r\nlaid in wait for the apparition, seized it with his powerful arm and\r\nflung it head over heels down into the castle court-yard. The next\r\nmorning the chancellor, Christopher Hass, was found there with his neck\r\nbroken, and upon his person a dagger and a letter proving him to have had\r\ntreasonable designs. Notwithstanding the spirit has several times been\r\nthus compromised, it has maintained itself to the present day. It was\r\nfirst seen in Berlin January 1, 1598, eight days before the death of the\r\nPrince Royal John George. When the French invasion took place, it\r\nreturned to Baireuth and was patriotic enough to take up its abode in the\r\nnew chateau which had never been occupied before the arrival of the\r\nFrench officer. Even Napoleon called the place _ce maudit chateau_, on\r\naccount of its mysterious inhabitant, and had to give up his lodgings\r\nto the ghost. He stopped in the chateau on his way to Russia but when he\r\nreturned next year he avoided passing the night there. With regard to the\r\nlast appearance at the palace at Berlin just before the late attempt on\r\nthe life of the king, and which has been described as \"a fearful\r\napparition of a White Lady dressed in thin and flowing garments, moving\r\nslowly and silently around and around the fountain to the terror of a\r\ncorporal standing near the entrance to the silver chamber,\" M. Minutoli\r\nproves it to have been an old woman once a cook at the chateau who has\r\nsince lived there and is known, by the nickname of Black Minna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. FANNY KEMBLE READING SHAKSPEARE AT THE ST. JAMES'\r\nTHEATER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. FANNY KEMBLE'S \"READINGS\" IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nMRS. KEMBLE has been giving a series of dramatic readings in London, and\r\nher success in the scene of her early triumphs appears to have been as\r\ndecided as it was in New York. She was never in a situation more\r\nagreeable to her temper and ambition than that represented in the above\r\nengraving, which we have copied from one in _The Illustrated News_. She\r\nis triumphant, and \"alone in her glory.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemble is now about forty years of age. Gentleness is acquired in\r\nthree generations; she is removed but two from the most vulgar condition;\r\nand by the mother's side but one. The Kembles of the last age were\r\nextraordinary persons. John Philip Kemble and Mrs. Siddons had both\r\nremarkable genius, and Charles Kemble has been an actor of consummate\r\ntalent. Whatever intellect remains in the family is in his children; one\r\nof whom is a man of learning and refinement, another a woman of some\r\ncleverness in musical art, and Frances Anne, of whom we write more\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of Miss Kemble on the stage was on the evening of\r\nthe 5th October, 1829, at Covent Garden, and was hazarded with the view\r\nof redeeming the fortunes of the theater. The play was \"Romeo and\r\nJuliet,\" and the heroine was sustained by the debutante with unexpected\r\npower. Her Siddonian countenance and expressive eyes were the general\r\ntheme of admiration; while the tenderness and ardor of her action went to\r\nthe soul of the spectator, and her well-instructed elocution satisfied\r\nthe most critical ear. It was then, also, that her father took the part\r\nof \"Mercutio,\" for the first time. It is recorded that he earned by it\r\nthirteen rounds of applause. Nor was its merit overrated. It was then,\r\nand continued to be, a wonderful impersonation of the poetic-comic ideal.\r\nOn the 21st of the same month of October, the performers of Covent Garden\r\npresented to Miss Kemble a gold bracelet as a testimony of the services\r\nwhich she had rendered to the company by her performance of \"Juliet.\" It\r\nwas not until the 9th of December that she had to change her _role_. She\r\nthen performed Belvidera in \"Venice Preserved,\" and achieved another\r\ntriumph. For some time the part was alternated with that of \"Juliet.\" The\r\nlatter, during the season, was performed thirty-six times; the former,\r\ntwenty-three. The \"Grecian Daughter,\" and Mrs. Beverley, Portia in \"The\r\nMerchant of Venice,\" Isabella, and Lady Townley, followed, and in all\r\nshe was eminently successful. Her season finished on the twenty-eighth\r\nof May, and in it she performed altogether, one hundred and two times.\r\nHer reputation, however, proved to be greater in the metropolis than in\r\nthe provinces. Nevertheless, on her return to London, she was greeted\r\nwith an enthusiastic reception. The next season was celebrated by the\r\nfailure of the \"Jew of Aragon,\" and the affair with Mr. Westmacott;\r\nhowever, Miss Kemble added to her _répertoire_ the characters of Mrs.\r\nHaller, Beatrice, Lady Constance, and Bianca in \"Fazio.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832 she came with her father to the United States, where she played\r\nwith unprecedented success in the principal cities, confirming the\r\nreputation she had acquired, of being the greatest British actress of the\r\nage. While here she published her dramas, \"The Star of Seville\" and\r\n\"Francis the First,\" and at this period she was a frequent contributor\r\nto the literary journals,--many of her best fugitive poems having\r\nappeared in the old \"New York Mirror.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1834 she retired from the stage, and was married to Mr. Pierce Butler\r\nof Philadelphia, a gentleman of fortune, accomplishments, and an\r\nhonorable character. The history of this union is sufficiently notorious.\r\nOn both sides there was ambition: it was a distinction to be accepted by\r\na woman of so much genius; it was a great happiness to change the\r\ndominion of a spendthrift and sometimes tyrannical father for that of a\r\nrich and indulgent husband. But a woman accustomed to the applause of the\r\ntheater never yet was content with the repose of domestic life, and she\r\nwas of all her sex the most ill-fitted by nature for such an existence.\r\nHer second resort to the stage in 1847, her fortunes at Manchester and in\r\nLondon, her return to America, her public readings of Shakspeare here,\r\nher divorce, and the very curious and unexplained circumstance of her\r\ntranslation of a profligate French play, and disposal of it as a piece of\r\nher own original composition, are all matters of too late occurrence to\r\nneed recapitulation.\r\n\r\nShe is a woman of masculine abilities, tastes, and energies; fitted\r\nbetter for the camp than for the drawing-room, and often evincing a\r\ndegree of discontent that she is not a man. She always _acts_, and has\r\nseldom, except when on the stage, the tact or ability even to seem\r\nnatural. Her equestrian exhibitions in Boston and New York, during her\r\nmore recent visits, illustrated the quality of her aspirations. Every\r\nday, at a particular hour, so that a crowd might assemble to look upon\r\nthe performance, her horse was brought to the front of her hotel, and\r\nwhen mounted, with affected difficulty, made to rear and pitch as if he\r\nnever before had felt the saddle or bit, and then to dash off as if upon\r\na race-course or to escape an avalanche. The letters to her husband, with\r\nmuch tact but without any necessity displayed to the public, in her\r\nanswer to his process for divorce, were admirable as compositions, and\r\nseemed to have been written in the very phrensy of passion; but their\r\neffect upon the reader was changed somewhat when he reflected that she\r\nhad been sufficiently self-possessed meanwhile to make _careful copies_\r\nbefore sending them, to be exhibited, as specimens of her genius, to a\r\nmob of the pit, which never fails to recognize a _point_. Indeed, in\r\npetticoats or in pantaloons, making a show of her \"heart\" in the\r\npublication of these letters to a gentleman whom she had treated with\r\nevery species of contempt, obloquy, and insult, until she had made his\r\nhome insupportable, or courting the wondering admiration of country\r\nbumpkins by unsexing herself for feats of horsemanship, or for other\r\nathletic diversions, she is always anxious to produce a sensation,\r\nanxious to stir up the gentle public to a roar.\r\n\r\nStill, with all her infirmities of taste and temper, Mrs. Kemble is a\r\nwoman of unquestionable and very decided genius; a genius frequently\r\ndisplayed in literature, where its growth may be traced, in prose, from\r\nher foolish \"Journal in America\" to her more artistic \"Year of\r\nConsolation;\" and in poetry, where its development is seen from its\r\nbudding in \"Frances the First\" to its most perfect blossoming in the\r\nrecent collection of her \"Poems.\" As an actress, her powers and\r\nqualifications are probably greater than those of any other _tragedienne_\r\nnow on the English stage; and her characteristics and supremacy are\r\nlikely to be far more profitably as well as distinctly evinced in her\r\n\"Shakspeare Readings\" than in any appearance before the footlights.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE IN AFRICA.\r\n\r\nThe Bible has been translated into the principal language of eastern\r\nAfrica, and the American Bible Society has lately received a copy of\r\n\"EVANGELIO za avioondika LUCAS.

On Thursday, business began in all the\r\nsections, and in the evening Prof. Bennett delivered a lecture on the\r\npassage of the blood through the minute vesicles of animals, in\r\nconnection with nutrition. On Friday, a party of about seventy started\r\nunder the direction of Mr. R. Chambers, to examine into the groovings on\r\nthe western face of Corstophine Hill, and the striæ on the sandstone\r\nnear Ravelstone. They afterward visited Arthur's Seat and St. Margaret's,\r\nwhere they examined the striated rocks and stones. In the evening there\r\nwas a conversazione and promenade. Saturday was devoted to excursions. On\r\nMonday afternoon upward of two hundred members dined together, Sir David\r\nBrewster presiding. In the evening, Dr. Mantell delivered a lecture on\r\nthe extinct birds of New Zealand. On Tuesday evening there was a\r\nfull-dress promenade and _soirée_. On Wednesday, the general committee\r\nassembled to sanction the grants that had passed the Committee of\r\nRecommendations: and in the afternoon of the same day the concluding\r\ngeneral meeting of the Association, for the accustomed ceremonial\r\nproceedings, was held. The next annual meeting is to take place at\r\nIpswich, and Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, will preside. The meeting,\r\naltogether, was one of unusual interest; among the persons present were\r\nthe chief lights of science, in the empire and from the continent, and\r\nour own country was represented by Prof. Hitchcock and several other\r\nscholars. The papers read in the various sections were numerous, and some\r\nof them are described as of very remarkable freshness and value. They\r\nwill soon be accessible in the published Transactions, which will this\r\nyear be more voluminous than ever.\r\n\r\nThe retiring President, Dr. Robinson, at the opening meeting,\r\ncongratulated himself on being able to surrender his dominion to his\r\nsuccessor in a more prosperous condition than he had received it, and\r\nspoke in glowing terms of the character and scientific achievements of\r\nthat successor, of whose labors he gave a brief but glowing history. Sir\r\nDavid Brewster, who was one of the founders of the Association, is a\r\nnative of Jedburgh, in Roxburgshire; where he was born December 11, 1781.\r\nHe was educated for the Church of Scotland, of which he became a\r\nlicentiate; and in 1800 he received the honorary degree of M. A. from the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh. While studying here he enjoyed the friendship\r\nof Robison, who then filled the Chair of Natural Philosophy; Playfair, of\r\nMathematics; and Dugald Stewart that of Moral Philosophy. In 1808, he\r\nundertook the editorship of the \"Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,\" which was only\r\nfinished in 1830. In 1807 he received the honorary degree of LL. D. from\r\nthe University of Aberdeen; and in 1808 was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh. Between 1801 and 1812 he devoted his attention\r\ngreatly to the study of Optics; and the results were published in a\r\n\"Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments,\" in 1813. In 1815 he received\r\nthe Copley Medal of the Royal Society for one of his discoveries in\r\noptical science; and soon after was admitted a Fellow of that body. In\r\n1816, the Institute of France adjudged to him half of the physical prize\r\nof 3000 francs, awarded for two of the most important discoveries made in\r\nEurope, in any branch of science, during the two preceding years; and in\r\n1819, Dr. Brewster received from the Royal Society the Rumford gold and\r\nsilver medals, for his discoveries on the Polarization of Light. In 1816\r\nhe invented the Kaleidoscope, the patent-right of which was evaded, so\r\nthat the inventor gained little beyond fame, though the large sale of the\r\ninstrument must have produced considerable profit. In 1819, in\r\nconjunction with Dr. Jameson, he established the \"_Edinburgh\r\nPhilosophical Journal_\"; and subsequently he commenced the \"_Edinburgh\r\nJournal of Science_,\" of which sixteen volumes appeared. In 1825, the\r\nInstitute of France elected him a Corresponding Member; and he has\r\nreceived the same honor from the Royal Academies of Russia, Prussia,\r\nSweden, and Denmark. In 1831, he received the Decoration of the\r\nHanoverian Guelphic Order; and in the following year, the honor of\r\nKnighthood from William the Fourth.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster has edited and written various works, besides\r\ncontributing largely to the _Edinburgh Review_, the _Transactions of the\r\nBritish Association_, and other scientific societies, and the _North\r\nBritish Review_. Among his more popular works are \"A Treatise on the\r\nKaleidoscope;\" an original Treatise on Optics for the _Cabinet\r\nCyclopaedia;_ and Letters on Natural Magic and a Life of Sir Isaac Newton\r\nfor the \"Family Library.\" The latter work has been translated into\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster is likewise one of the editors of the _London and\r\nEdinburgh Philosophical Magazine_.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Sir David Brewster range from the kaleidoscope to the\r\nlaw of the angle of polarization, the physical laws of metallic\r\nreflection, and the optical properties of crystals; and the venerable\r\nphilosopher is the author of an immense number of facts and practical\r\napplications in every branch of optics.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION assembled this year at New Haven, and\r\nWas presided over by Alex. D. Bache, LL. D. of the Coast Survey. It was\r\nattended by many of the most eminent men of science in this country,\r\namong whom were President Woolsey, Professor Denison Olmsted, the elder\r\nand the younger Silliman, E. C. Herrick, and E. Loomis, of Yale College;\r\nProfessors Louis Agassiz, E. N. Hosford and Benjamin Pierce of Harvard\r\nUniversity; Lieutenant Charles H. Davis, U. S. N.; Professor O. M.\r\nMitchell, Superintendent of the Cincinnati Observatory; Dr. A. L. Elwyn\r\nof Philadelphia; Professor Walter R. Johnson of Washington; Professor\r\nJoseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; William C.\r\nRedfield of New York; and an unusual number of amateur scholars from\r\nvarious parts of the Union. There were several papers of remarkable\r\nvalue, among which that of Mr. Squier, our Charge d'Affaires for Central\r\nAmerica, was perhaps at this period of the most general interest. Others\r\nwere puerile, and as unfit in subject as in ability for presentation in\r\nsuch an assembly. It is to be regretted that the Association does not\r\nadopt the only protection against such discreditable annoyances, by\r\ninsisting upon the submission of everything offered for its consideration\r\nto a competent private committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA GREAT NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING, is said to have\r\nbeen discussed recently at the meetings of inferior societies, and we\r\nhave read a circular upon the subject, which contemplates a convention of\r\nscholars and men of letters, at Washington, some time in the coming\r\nwinter. The American Philosophical Society, founded by Franklin, and made\r\nrespectable by the labors of many eminent men, is no longer in authority,\r\nand its proceedings command little attention. The various societies for\r\nthe cultivation of the natural sciences, in Philadelphia, Boston, and\r\nNew York, are undoubtedly accomplishing much good, but the spheres and\r\ndegrees of their influence would be greatly enlarged under a central\r\norganization. In such a design, the initiative should be taken by men of\r\nnerve as well as men of abilities, so that the dead weights of mediocrity\r\nso constantly obtruding into and making ridiculous the present societies,\r\nshould be altogether excluded.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in this city, the most reputable and dignified association\r\nconnected with the advancement of learning, has been the Ethnological\r\nSociety. It is to be feared that with the death of Mr. Gallatin, its\r\npresident, and the dispersion of so many of its active members in the\r\ndiplomatic service, its action hereafter will deserve less consideration\r\nthan has thus far been awarded to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE'S APOLOGY FOR HIS CONFIDENCES.\r\n\r\nLamartine has just commenced the publication of a second part of his\r\nConfidences, in the feuilleton of _La Presse_, and precedes it by the\r\nfollowing letter to the editor of that paper, which we translate for _The\r\nInternational_ from _La Presse_ of July 30. It relates to the way in\r\nwhich he came to publish the work, and gives a deeply interesting account\r\nof the pecuniary embarrassments under which he had for some time been\r\nlaboring, and then eloquently defends the publication of what is real,\r\nand glowing in private life and experience.\r\n\r\n_To M. de Girardin:_\r\n\r\nIn addressing to you, my dear Girardin, this third volume of private\r\nnotes, to which the public have given the name of _Confidences_, I cannot\r\nrepress an emotion of pain. What I foresaw but too well has happened. I\r\nhave opened my life, and it has evaporated. This journal of my\r\nimpressions has found grace, indulgence, interest even, with some\r\nreaders, if I may judge from the anonymous friends who have written me.\r\nBut the unsparing critics, men who mingle even our tears with their ink,\r\nin order to give more bitterness to their sarcasms, have not pardoned\r\nthose outbursts of a soul of twenty. They have believed, or have\r\npretended to believe, that I was seeking a miserable celebrity in the\r\nashes of my own heart: they have said, that by an anticipation of vanity,\r\nI desired to gather and enjoy in advance, while yet living, the sad\r\nFlowers which might one day grow after me upon my tomb. They have cried\r\nout at the profanation of the inner feeling; at the effrontery of a soul\r\nshown naked; at the scandal of recollections made public; at the venality\r\nof sacred things; at the _simony_ of the poet selling his own fibers to\r\nsave the roof and the tree that overshadowed his cradle. I have read and\r\nheard in silence all their malign interpretations of an act, the true\r\nnature of which had been revealed to you long before it was to the\r\npublic. I have answered nothing. What could I say? The appearances were\r\nagainst me. You alone knew that these notes had long existed, shut up in\r\nmy casket of rosewood, along with the ten volumes of the notes of my\r\nmother; that they were intended never to be taken thence; that I rejected\r\nthe first suggestion of publishing them, with all possible warmth of\r\nresolution; that I refused the ransom of a king for those leaves of no\r\nreal value; and that finally, one day--a day for which I reproach\r\nmyself-constrained fatally to choose between the necessity of selling my\r\npoor _Charmettes_--_Charmettes_, as dear and more holy than the\r\n_Charmettes_ of the _Confessions_--and the necessity of publishing these\r\npages, I preferred myself to suffer rather than cause suffering to good\r\nold servants, by selling their roofs and their vines to strangers. With\r\none hand I received the price of the _Confidences_, and with the other I\r\ngave it to others in order to purchase time.\r\n\r\nBehold here all the crime that I am expiating.\r\n\r\nAnd let the critics rejoice till their vengeance is satiated. This\r\nsacrifice was in vain. It is in vain that I have cast upon the wind these\r\nleaves, torn from the book of my most pious memories. The time that their\r\nprice procured has not proved sufficient to conduct me to the threshold\r\nof that abode where we cease to regret anything. My _Charmettes_ have\r\nbeen sold. Let them be content. I have had the shame of publishing these\r\n_Confidences_, but not the joy of having saved my garden. Steps of\r\nstrangers will efface there the steps of my father and mother. God is\r\nGod, and sometimes he commands the wind to uproot the oak of a hundred\r\nyears, and man to uproot his own heart. The oak and the heart are his, we\r\nmust yield them to him, and yield him therewith justice, glory, and\r\nbenedictions!\r\n\r\nAnd now that my acceptance of these critics is complete, and that I\r\nconfess myself guilty, and still more, afflicted--am I as guilty as they\r\nsay, and is there no excuse, which, in the eyes of indulgent and\r\nimpartial readers, can extenuate my crime?\r\n\r\nIn order to judge as to this, I have but one question to ask you, and the\r\npublic, which deigns with distracted finger to turn these pages. My\r\nquestion is this:\r\n\r\nIs it to myself, or to others, that the published pages of these\r\n_Confidences_ can have done injury in the view of those who have read\r\nthem? Is there a single man now living, is there a single memory of one\r\nof the dead, on whom these recollections have cast an odious or even\r\nunfavorable light, whether on his name, his family, his life, or his\r\ngrave? Have they brought sadness to the soul of our mother in the heaven\r\nwhere she resides? Has the manly face of our father been lessened in the\r\nrespect of his descendants? Has _Graziella_, that precocious and withered\r\nflower of my early manhood, received aught beyond a few tears of young\r\ngirls shed on a tomb at Portici? Has Julia, the worship of my young\r\nenthusiasm, lost in the imagination of those who know the name, that\r\npurity which she has preserved in my heart? And my masters, those pious\r\nJesuits, whose name I love not, but whose virtue I venerate; my friends,\r\ndearest and first harvested, Virieu Vignet, the Abbe Dumont, could they\r\ncomplain, returning here below, that I have disfigured their beautiful\r\nnatures, discolored their noble images, or soiled one place in their\r\nlives? I appeal to all who have read. Would a single shade command me to\r\nefface a single line? Many of whom I have spoken are still living, or\r\ntheir sisters, or their sons, or their friends: have I humiliated them?\r\nThey would have told me.\r\n\r\nNo! I have embalmed only pure recollections. My shroud was poor, but it\r\nwas spotless. The modest name I have wrapped there for myself will\r\nneither be adorned nor dishonored by it. No tenderness will reproach me;\r\nno family will accuse me of profanation in naming it. A remembrance is an\r\ninviolable thing because it is voiceless, and must be approached with\r\npiety. I could never console myself if I had allowed to fall from this\r\nlife into that other life, whence no one can answer, one word which could\r\nwound those absent immortals whom we call the dead. I desire that not a\r\nsingle word, thoughtfully uttered, should remain after me against one of\r\nthe men who will one day be my survivors. Posterity is not the sewer of\r\nour passions--it is the urn of our memories, and should preserve nothing\r\nbut perfumes.\r\n\r\nThese _Confidences_ have then done injury or caused pain to no one, among\r\nthe living or among the dead. I mistake, they have done injury to me, but\r\nto me alone. I have depicted myself such as I was: one of those natures,\r\nalas! so common among the children of women, wrought not of one clay\r\nonly, not of that purified and exceptional substance which forms heroes,\r\nsaints, and sages, but moulded of every earth which enters into the\r\nformation of the weak and passionate man; of lofty aspirations, and\r\nnarrow wings; of great desires, and short hands to reach whither they are\r\nextended; sublime in ideal, vulgar in reality; with fire in the heart,\r\nillusion in the mind, and tears in the eyes; human statues, which attest\r\nby the diversity of the elements that compose them, the mysterious\r\nfailings of our poor nature; in which, as in the metal of Corinth, we\r\nfind after the fire the traces of all the melted metals which were\r\nmingled and confounded in it, a little gold and much lead. But, I repeat,\r\nwhom have I injured but myself?\r\n\r\nBut they say, these unvailed exposures of sentiments and of life offend\r\nthat virginal modesty of soul, of which outward modesty is but an\r\nimperfect emblem? You show ourself unvailed, and you do not blush! Who\r\nthen are you?\r\n\r\nAlas! I am what you see, a poor writer; a writer, that is to say, a\r\nthinker, in public. I am, less their genius and virtue, what were St.\r\nAugustine, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Montaigne, all those men\r\nWho have silently interrogated their souls and replied aloud, so that\r\ntheir dialogue with themselves might also be a useful conversation with\r\nthe century in which they lived, or with the future. The human heart is\r\nan instrument  which has neither the same number nor quality of chords in\r\nevery bosom, and on which new notes may eternally be discovered and added\r\nto the infinite scale of sentiments and melodies in the universe. This is\r\nour part, poets and writers in spite of ourselves, rhapsodists of the\r\nendless poem that nature chants to men and God! Why accuse me, if you\r\nexcuse yourselves? Are we not of the same family of the _Homeridae_, who\r\nfrom door to door recount histories, of which they are by turns the\r\nhistorians and the heroes? Is it, then, in the nature of thought to\r\nbecome a crime in becoming public? A thought, vulgar, critical,\r\nskeptical, dogmatic, may, according to you, be unvailed innocently:\r\na sentiment, commonplace, cold, not intimate, awaking no palpitation\r\nwithin you, no response in others, may be revealed without violation of\r\nmodesty; but a thought that is pious, ardent, lighted at the fire of the\r\nheart or of heaven, a sentiment burning, cast forth by an explosion of\r\nthe volcano of the soul; a cry of the inmost nature, awaking by its\r\naccent of truth young and sympathetic voices in the present age or the\r\nfuture: and above all, a tear! a tear not painted like those which flow\r\nupon your shrouds of parade, a tear of water and salt, falling from the\r\neyes, instead of a drop of ink, falling from the pen! This is crime! this\r\nis shame! this is immodesty, for you! That is to say, that whatever is\r\ncold and artificial is innocent in the artist, but what is warm and\r\nnatural is unpardonable in the man. That is to say, modesty in a writer\r\nconsists in exposing what is false, immodesty in setting forth what is\r\ntrue. If you have talent, show it, but not your soul, carrying mine away!\r\nOh, shame! What logic!\r\n\r\nBut after all, you are right at bottom, only you do not know how to\r\nexpress it. It is perfectly true that there are mysteries, nudities,\r\nparts of the soul not shameful but sensitive, depths, personalities, last\r\nfoldings of thought and feeling, which would cost horribly to uncover,\r\nand which an honorable and natural scruple would never permit us to lay\r\nbare, without the remorse of violated modesty. There is, I agree with\r\nyou, such a thing as indiscretion of heart. I felt this cruelly myself,\r\nthe first time when, having written certain poetic dreams of my soul\r\ncertain too real utterances of my sentiments, I read them to my most\r\nintimate friends. My face was covered with blushes, and I could not\r\nfinish. I said to them: \"No, I cannot go farther; you shall read it.\"\r\n\"And how is it,\" answered my friends, \"that you cannot read to us what\r\nyou are about to give to all Europe to read?\" \"No,\" I said, \"I cannot\r\ntell why, but I feel no shame in letting the public read it, though I\r\nexperience an invincible repugnance to reading it myself, face to face to\r\nonly two or three of my friends.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not understand me--I did not understand myself. We together\r\nexclaimed at the inconsistency of the human heart. Since then I have felt\r\nthe same instinctive repugnance at reading to a single person what cost\r\nme not a single effort of violated modesty to give to the public: and\r\nafter having long reflected on it, I find that this apparent\r\ninconsistency is at bottom only the perfect logic of our nature.\r\n\r\nAnd why is this? The reason is, that a friend is somebody and the public\r\nnobody; a friend has a face, the public has not; a friend is a being,\r\npresent, hearing, looking, a real being--the public is an invisible\r\nbeing, a being of the reason, an abstraction; a friend has a name, and\r\nthe public is anonymous; a friend is a confidant, and the public is a\r\nfiction. I blush before the one, because he is a man; I do not blush\r\nbefore the other, because it is an idea. When I write or speak before the\r\npublic, I feel myself as free, as exempt from the susceptibilities of one\r\nman to another, as if I were speaking or writing before God and in the\r\ndesert; the crowd is a solitude; you see it, you know that it exists, but\r\nyou know it only as a mass. As an individual it does not exist. Now this\r\nmodesty of which you speak, being the respect of one's self before some\r\nother person, when there is no person distinct on account of the\r\nmultitude, becomes without a motive. Psyche blushed under a lamp because\r\nthe hand of a single god passed over her, but when the sun gazed at her\r\nwith his thousand rays from the height of Olympus, that personification\r\nof the modest soul did not blush before the whole heaven. Here is the\r\nexact image of the modesty of a writer before a single auditor, and of\r\nthe freedom of his utterance before all the world. Do you accuse me of\r\nviolating mysteries before you? You have not the right: I do not know\r\nyou, I have confided nothing to you personally. You are guilty of\r\nimpropriety in reading what is not addressed to you. You are _somebody_,\r\nyou are not the public. What do you want with me? I have not spoken to\r\nyou: you have nothing to say to me, and I nothing to reply.\r\n\r\nSo thought St. Augustine, Plato, Socrates, Cicero, Cæsar, Bernardin de\r\nSt. Pierre, Montaigne, Alfieri, Chateaubriand, and all other men who have\r\nconfided to the world the genuine palpitations of their own hearts. True\r\ngladiators they are in the human Colosseum, not playing miserable\r\ncomedies of sentiment and style to distract an academy, but struggling\r\nand dying in earnest on the stage of the world, and writing on the sand,\r\nwith the blood of their own veins, the heroism, the failings, or the\r\nagonies of the human heart.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I resume these notes where I left them, blushing for\r\none thing only before these critics, that is, for not having either the\r\nsoul of St. Augustine or the genius of Jean Jacques Rousseau, in order to\r\nmerit, by indiscretions as sacred and touching, the pardon of tender\r\nhearts and the condemnation of narrow minds, that take every movement of\r\nthe soul for an obscenity, and hide their faces whenever they are shown a\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBALZAC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have news from Paris of the death of Honore De Balzac, one of the most\r\neminent French writers of the nineteenth century. \"Eighteen months ago,\"\r\nsays a Paris letter, \"already attacked by dropsy, he quitted France to\r\ncontract a marriage with a Russian lady, to whom he was devotedly\r\nattached. To her he had dedicated 'Seraphitus,' and he had accumulated in\r\nhis hotel of the Beaujoin quarters all the luxuries which could\r\ncontribute to her pleasure. He returned to France three months ago, in a\r\nstate of extreme danger. Last week he underwent an operation for abscess\r\nin his legs: mortification ensued. On the morning of the 18th he became\r\nspeechless, and at midnight he expired. His sister, Madame de Surville,\r\nvisited his deathbed, and the pressure of her hand was the last sign he\r\ngave of intelligence.\" We must defer for another occasion what we have\r\nto say of the great novelist-the idol of women, even at seventy-the\r\nVoltaire of our age, as he was accustomed to style himself in\r\nprivate--the historian of society--French society--as it is. The author\r\nof _Le Peau de Chagrin, Le Physiologie du Marriage, Le Dernier Chauan,\r\nEugene Grandet_, and the _Scenes de la Vie Parisienne_, and _Scenes de la\r\nVie de Province_, was one of the marks of the era, and being dead, we\r\nwill speculate upon him. At present we can only translate for the\r\n_International_ the following funeral oration by Victor Hugo, pronounced\r\nat his grave:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN--The man who has just descended into this tomb is one of those\r\nwhom the public sorrow follows to the last abode. In the times where we\r\nare all fictions have disappeared. Henceforth our eyes are fixed not on\r\nthe heads that reign but on the heads that think, and the whole country\r\nis affected when one of them disappears. At this day, the people put on\r\nmourning for the man of talent, the nation for the man of genius.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, the name of Balzac will be mingled in the luminous trace that\r\nour epoch will leave in the future.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Balzac belonged to that potent generation of writers of the\r\nnineteenth century who came after Napoleon, just as the illustrious\r\npleiades of the seventeenth century came after Richelieu, and in the\r\ndevelopment of civilization a law caused the domination of thought to\r\nsucceed the domination of the sword.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Balzac was one of the first among the greatest, one of the highest\r\namong the best. This is not the place to say all or that splendid and\r\nsovereign intelligence. All his books form only one hook, living,\r\nluminous, profound, in which we see moving all our contemporaneous\r\ncivilization, mingled with I know not what of strange and terrible; a\r\nmarvelous book, that the poet has entitled comedy, and which he might\r\nhave called history; which assumes all forms and all styles: which goes\r\nbeyond Tacitus and reaches Suetonius, which crosses Beaumarchais and\r\nreaches Rabelais; a book which is observation itself, and imagination\r\nitself; which is prodigal of the true, the passionate, the common, the\r\ntrivial, the material, and which at moments throws athwart realities,\r\nsuddenly and broadly torn open, the gleam of the most somber and tragic\r\nideal.\r\n\r\n\"Without knowing it, whether he will or not, whether he consents or not,\r\nthe author of this strange and immense work is of the mighty race of\r\nrevolutionary writers. Balzac goes directly to his object. He assails\r\nmodern society face to face. From all he forces something: from some\r\nillusions, from others hope, from these a cry of pain, from those a mask.\r\nHe unvails vice and dissects passion. He penetrates and sounds the heart,\r\nthe soul, the sentiments, the brain, the abyss that each man has within\r\nhim. And by a gift of his free and vigorous nature, by a privilege of the\r\nintelligences of our times,--who, having seen revolutions nearly and with\r\ntheir own eyes, perceive better the end of humanity and comprehend better\r\nthe course of Providence,--Balzac came forth serene and smiling from\r\nthose redoubtable studies which produced melancholy in Moliere and\r\nmisanthropy in Rousseau.\r\n\r\n\"This is what he has accomplished among us. Such is the work he has left\r\nus, lofty and solid, a pile of granite, a monumental edifice, from whose\r\nsummit his renown will henceforth shine. Great men make their own\r\npedestals: the future charges itself with their statues.\r\n\r\n\"His death has struck Paris with stupor. But a few months since he\r\nreturned to France. Feeling that he was about to die, he desired to see\r\nhis country, like one who on the eve of a long voyage comes to embrace\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\n\"His life was brief, but crowded; fuller of labors than of days.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, the powerful and indefatigable laborer, the philosopher, the\r\nthinker, the poet, the man of genius, lived among us the life of storms,\r\nof struggles, of quarrels, of combats, common in all times to all great\r\nmen. Today, behold him here at peace. He leaves collisions and\r\nhostilities. The same day he enters on glory and the tomb. Henceforth\r\nhe will shine above all the clouds over our heads, among the stars of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"And you all who are here, are you not tempted to envy him?\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, whatever be our sorrow in the presence of such a loss, let us\r\nresign ourselves to these catastrophes. Let us accept them in their\r\npoignancy and severity. It is good perhaps, and necessary, in an epoch\r\nlike ours, that from time to time a great death should communicate a\r\nreligious book to minds devoured by doubt and skepticism. Providence\r\nknows what it does when it thus puts a whole people face to face with the\r\nsupreme mystery, and gives it Death to meditate upon, which is at once\r\nthe great equality and the great liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Providence knows what it does, for here is the highest of instructions.\r\nThere can be in all hearts only austere and serious thoughts when a\r\nsublime spirit majestically makes its entrance upon the other life; when\r\none of those beings whom the visible wings of genius have long sustained\r\nabove the crowd, suddenly puts forth those other wings that we cannot\r\nsee, and disappears in the unknown!\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not the unknown! No, I have already said it on another mournful\r\noccasion, and I shall not weary in repeating it, it is not darkness, it\r\nis light! It is not the end, it is the beginning! It is not nothing, it\r\nis eternity! Is not this true, I ask all that hear me? Such graves as\r\nthis are proofs of immortality. In the presence of the illustrious dead\r\nwe feel more distinctly the divine destinies of this intelligence called\r\nman, which traverses the earth to suffer and to be purified; and we know\r\nthat those who have shone with genius during life, must be living souls\r\nafter death.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. GUTZLAFF, THE MISSIONARY.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GUTZLAFF the famous missionary in China is described in the\r\n_Grenzboten_ by a writer who lately heard him preach at Vienna, as a\r\nshort, stout man, with a deep red face, a large mouth, sleepy eyes,\r\npointed inward and downward like those of a China man, vehement\r\ngesticulations, and a voice more loud than melodious. He has acquired\r\nin his features and expression something like the expression of the\r\npeople among whom he lives. His whole manners also, as well as his\r\nface, indicate the genuine son of Jao and Chun, so that the Chinese when\r\nthey encounter him in the street salute him as their countryman. We\r\ntranslate for _The International_ the following sketch of his life and\r\nlabors:\r\n\r\nCharles Gutzlaff was born in 1803, at Pyritz, a village of Pomerania. His\r\nzeal as an apostle was first manifested some fifteen years ago. He\r\nmarried an English woman, who was animated with the same aspiration as\r\nhimself and who accompanied him on his voyages as a missionary. His\r\nextensive acquaintance with the Chinese and kindred languages even then\r\nmade deep impression on Robert Morrison, the founder of the Evangelical\r\nMission in China, whom he joined in 1831 at Macao, and caused his\r\nAcquaintance to be much sought by the merchants. In 1832 and 1833 he was\r\nemployed as an interpreter on board ships engaged in smuggling opium, but\r\nturned this occupation, which in itself was not of a very saintly\r\ncharacter, to his religious ends, by the dissemination of tracts and\r\nBibles. A missionary journey to Japan which he undertook in 1837 was\r\nwithout  any result. After Morrison's death Gutzlaff was appointed\r\nChinese Secretary to the British Consulate at Canton, and in 1840 founded\r\na Christian Union of Chinese for the propagation of the Gospel among\r\ntheir countrymen. His present journey through Europe has a similar\r\npurpose, the foundation of Missionary Societies for the spread of\r\nChristianity in China.\r\n\r\nHis literary labors have had an almost incredible extent and variety. He\r\nHimself gives the following enumeration of his writings: \"In Dutch I have\r\nwritten: a History of our Mission and of distinguished Missionaries, and\r\nan appeal for support of the Missionary Work; in German: Sketches of the\r\nMinor Prophets; in Latin: The Life of our Savior; in English: Sketches of\r\nChinese History; China Opened; Life of Kanghe, together with a great\r\nnumber of articles on the Religion, History, Philosophy, Literature and\r\nLaws of the Chinese; in Siamese: a Translation of the New Testament, with\r\nthe Psalms, and an English-Siamese Dictionary, English-Cambodian\r\nDictionary and English-Laos Dictionary. These works I left to my\r\nsuccessors to finish, but with the exception of the Siamese Dictionary\r\nthey have added nothing to them. In Cochin-Chinese: a Complete Dictionary\r\nCochin-Chinese-English and English-Cochin-Chinese; this work is not yet\r\nprinted. In Chinese: Forty Tracts, along with three editions of the Life\r\nof our Savior; a Translation of the New Testament, the third edition of\r\nwhich I have carried through the press. Of the Translations of the Old\r\nTestament the Prophets and the two first books of Moses are completed. In\r\nthis language I have also written The Chinese Scientific Monthly Review,\r\na History of England, a History of the Jews, a Universal History and\r\nGeography, on Commerce, a short Account of the British Empire and its\r\nInhabitants, as well as a number of smaller articles. In Japanese: a\r\nTranslation of the New Testament, and of the first book of Moses, two\r\ntracts, and several scientific pamphlets. The only paper to which I now\r\nsend communications is the Hong Kong Gazette, the whole Chinese\r\ndepartment of which I have undertaken. Till the year 1842 I wrote for\r\nthe Chinese Archives.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer in the _Grenzboten_ goes on to say that \"so vast a surface as\r\nthese writings cover, requires a surprising facility of mind and an\r\nindefatigable perseverance. When you see the man engaged in his\r\nmissionary toils you understand the whole at once. He arrives in a city\r\nand hastens to the church which is prepared for his reception. After\r\npreaching for an hour with the greatest energy he takes up his\r\ncollection and is gone. He speaks with such rapidity that it is  hardly\r\npossible to follow him. Such rapidity is not favorable to excellence\r\nin the work. Of all his writings, only one work is known to me, that\r\npublished in  Munich, in 1847, under the title of 'Gutzlaffs History of\r\nthe Chinese Empire from the earnest times to the Peace of Nankin'. In our\r\nimperfect acquaintance with Chinese history this compendium is not\r\nwithout value, but it displays no critical power, and is a mere external\r\ncompilation and poorly written. From it we learn as good as nothing of\r\nthe peculiar customs and state of mental culture of the country. The\r\nwhole resembles a Christian History of the World written in the\r\neighteenth century, Beginning with Adam and Eve, and leaving the Greeks\r\nand Romans out altogether because they were without a divine revelation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gutzlaff's family were recently for several months in the United\r\nStates, and the proceedings of the great missionary--second in eminence\r\nonly to our own Judson--have always been regarded with much interest by\r\nthe American churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS AND BOOKS\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic Society at Paris has just held its twenty-eighth yearly\r\nsession. According to the report of its Secretary and Financial\r\nCommittee, this society has suffered little from the disastrous times\r\nwhich have fallen on literature generally. In 1848, being uncertain as to\r\nthe future, it stopped receiving subscriptions to works with a view to\r\ntheir publication, and arrested the printing of those which were already\r\ncommenced, with the single exception of the Asiatic Journal, which the\r\nmembers determined not to alter in any case. The series of this journal\r\nis of great value, containing already fifty-five volumes, to which two\r\nnew ones are added every year. For many years it has contained only\r\noriginal articles, though formerly it admitted translations from other\r\nEuropean languages. Of course, in so voluminous a periodical work, the\r\ncontents vary in character, but the whole is of the greatest importance\r\nto History, Belles Lettres, and Philology, and should not be wanting in\r\nany public library. The society has now resumed the suspended\r\npublications, beginning with the \"Chronicles of Cashmir\", by the Austrian\r\nOrientalist Captain Troyer, two volumes of which were issued some time\r\nsince. Troyer is a remarkable man. As an Austrian artillery and staff\r\nofficer he served in all the wars, from the breaking out of the French\r\nRevolution to the Peace of Paris. While in Italy, he passed some time at\r\nthe head-quarters of Lord William Bentinck, as an Austrian Commissioner,\r\nand so gained his esteem and confidence that he was invited to go with\r\nLord William to Madras as his military secretary. When Lord William\r\nresigned the government of Madras, Troyer remained for some time as\r\nDirector of the East India Company's School for Artillery and Engineers,\r\ntill finally he resigned and came to Paris. In 1829, Lord William went\r\nagain to India as Governor-General, and persuaded Troyer to go with him.\r\nWhile in India at this time, among other offices Troyer filled that of\r\nSecretary of the Hindoo College. In 1834, when Bentinck again left India,\r\nTroyer once more resigned his functions, and has since been in Paris,\r\ndevoting an active and honorable old age to constant labors upon Persian\r\nand Indian literature.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe FRENCH ACADEMY held its annual public session on the 8th of August,\r\nin the presence of a large audience, including almost all the literary\r\ncelebrities of the metropolis, both masculine and feminine. The prizes of\r\nvictory were given to Napoleon Hurney, who had saved the lives of\r\nfourteen persons, and to Marguerite Briand, for having supported and\r\ntaken care for forty-five years of her mistress, who had fallen from\r\nwealth into the extremest poverty. M. de Salvandy, who bestowed these\r\nprizes, delivered the usual eulogy on virtue in general, winding up with\r\npraise of Louis Philippe and his reign, a thing more creditable perhaps\r\nto the fidelity and consistency of the speaker, who has never renounced\r\nhis allegiance to the Orleans family, than proper to the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe literary prizes were distributed by M. Villemain. The grand prize of\r\nten thousand francs for the best work on the history of France, was given\r\nto Augustin Thierry. Emile Angier received a prize of seven thousand\r\nfrancs for his comedy of \"Gabrielle,\" and M. Antran one of three thousand\r\nfor his \"Daughter of Æsehylus.\" Three ladies got prizes worth two\r\nthousand francs each for works of a popular nature on moral subjects; M.\r\nA. Garnier got one of one thousand for his _Morale Sociale_; M. Martin\r\nthe same for his _Philosophie Spiritualiste de la Nature_, and M. Kastus\r\nthe same for his _Psycologie d'Aristote_. The crown for the best\r\nspecimen of eloquence was awarded to M. Baudrillast for his Eulogy on\r\nMadame de Stael, in which the literary history and character of the\r\nsubject were served up in the most florid style. The same writer once\r\nbefore won the same prize by a eulogy on Turgot. His productions are more\r\nelaborate and showy than substantial and permanent in their character.\r\n\r\nIt must be said that this Academy is rather a respectable and slow-moving\r\ninstitutution. The most illustrious names of France are not always\r\nincluded in the list of its members. Neither Beranger nor Lamenais belong\r\nto it. A writer in the Paris _National_ says that after three hours at\r\nits meeting everybody he met in the street seemed to belong to the time\r\nof Louis XI.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDWARD EVERETT has been many years engaged in the collection and\r\narrangement of materials for a systematic Treatise on the Modern Law of\r\nNations; more especially in reference to those questions which nave been\r\ndiscussed between the governments of the United States and Europe since\r\nthe Peace of 1783. This will be Mr. Everett's \"life poem.\" Hitherto he\r\nhas written nothing very long except the \"Defense of the Christian\r\nReligion,\" published when he was about twenty-one years of age. We have\r\njust received from Little & Brown their edition of the \"Orations and\r\nSpeeches\" of Mr. Everett, in two very large and richly-printed volumes,\r\nwhich we shall hereafter notice more largely. These are to be followed,\r\nat the author's leisure, by his Political Reports and Speeches and\r\nOfficial Papers, in two large volumes, and his contributions to the\r\n_North American Review_, which, if all included, we think will make four\r\nothers: so that his works, beside the new treatise above mentioned, will\r\nbe completed in not less than eight volumes. We are gratified at the\r\nprospect of such a collection of these masterpieces of rhetoric, so full\r\nof learning and wisdom, and infused by so genial a spirit. We wish some\r\npublisher would give us in the same style all the writings of Alexander\r\nEverett.\r\n\r\nCHARLES MACKAY has lately published in London, a work upon which he had\r\nlong been engaged, under the title of \"Progress of the Intellect.\" We\r\nsuspect, from the reviewals of it which appear in the journals, that it\r\nis of the German free thinking class of philosophical histories. It\r\nembraces dissertations on Intellectual Religion, Ancient Cosmogony, the\r\nMetaphysical Idea of God, the Moral Notion of God, the Theory of\r\nMediation, Hebrew Theory of Retribution and Immortality, the Messianic\r\nTheory prevailing in the days of Jesus, Christian Forms and Reforms, and\r\nSpeculative Christianity. And these dissertations are written with an\r\neloquence and power unexampled in a work of so much learning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. AND MAD. DE LAMARTINE having returned from the East, are at present\r\nStaying at the Villa du Prado, a branch of the Hotel des Empereurs, a\r\npleasant house on the banks of the Huveaune, in the midst of the most\r\nbeautiful landscape. It was in a country box, upon the Avenue du Prado,\r\nthat Lamartine wrote, in 1847, his \"Histoire des Girondins.\" Lamartine is\r\npleased with his Smyrna estate; he was received there by his vassals _en\r\ngrand seigneur_, but he found that he would be obliged to expend a good\r\ndeal of money before the estate would be profitable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEODORE PARKER'S \"Massachusetts Quarterly Review,\" is dead, and--God be\r\nPraised that New England refused to support it any longer. Mr. Parker\r\nsays in the farewell to his readers, that the work \"has never become what\r\nits projector designed that it should be;\" and expresses a hope that\r\n\"some new journal will presently be started, in a more popular form,\r\nwhich will promote the great ideas of our times, by giving them an\r\nexpression in literature, and so help them to a permanent organization in\r\nthe life of mankind.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCAPT.

It consists simply of a prize of twenty thousand francs offered\r\nto the competition of the literary and artistic world. The first year it\r\nwill be given to the best among the poems, romances, and dramatic works\r\nsubmitted; the second year to the best picture; the third year to the\r\nbest piece of statuary; the fourth year to the best piece of music,\r\nwhether sacred or profane, opera or oratorio. This circle having been\r\ncompleted, the prize will next be given as at the first year; and so on\r\nin regular succession. The successful competitor is to remain proprietor\r\nof his work, as are all the others. The prize will he allotted by two\r\ncommittees, one at Weimar the other at Berlin. The establishment of the\r\nfund was celebrated at Weimar on the 23d of August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGIFFORD, some five-and-twenty years ago, declared that all the fools of\r\nthe country had taken to write plays; and it would appear that all the\r\ndull Englishmen of our day have taken to write pamphlets on the\r\nslave-trade. The London _Times_ is very severe upon a book just issued by\r\nMr. W. Gore Ouseley, who was several years British Charge d'Affaires at\r\nRio, as such conducted a voluminous correspondence on the subject with\r\nthe government of Brazil, and might have been expected to have there\r\nlearned something on the slave-trade worth telling. According to his\r\nreviewer he appears, however, to be one of that class of persons\r\ndescribed by Sterne, who, traveling from Dan to Beersheba, found all to\r\nbe barren; and no amount of observation can in any human being supply\r\ndefective reasoning faculties. So, says the _Times_, he has little or\r\nnothing to say about the Brazilian slave-trade that has not been better\r\nsaid a thousand times before; and when he does venture on a special\r\nstatement of his own, it topples down the whole superstructure of his\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nA work of rather more interest is \"Seven Years' Service on the Slave\r\nCoast of Africa\", by Sir Henry Huntley, who, when a lieutenant in the navy\r\nin 1831, was ordered to the scene of his observations. Shortly after his\r\narrival, he was appointed to the independent command of a small vessel,\r\nin which he visited stations, looked out for slavers, chased them when he\r\nsaw them, and captured them when he could. A few years subsequently he\r\nwas nominated Governor of the settlements on the Gambia. His two volumes\r\ncontain his adventures during the whole or nearly the whole of his seven\r\nyears' service upon the station; the last closing abruptly in the middle\r\nof preparations for a congress of black kings. The public is already\r\nfamiliar with many of the topics, from the occasional narratives of\r\nvoyages and adventures along the coast. Visits to the commandants of the\r\nso-called castles; a description of the European and native mode of life\r\nat the settlements; accounts of the slave-stations, the slave-dealers,\r\nthe slaves, and the slave-trade, together with sketches of more\r\nlegitimate commerce, and occasional trips to the islands lying off the\r\ncoast, for change of air and fresh supplies, are frequent features. Sir\r\nHenry Huntley's duties sometimes brought him in contact with native\r\nchiefs, and continually with slavers, in the search, the capture, and the\r\npursuit. During the latter part of his career, the office of Governor\r\ngave great variety and largeness to his subjects; consisting of public\r\nbusiness, palavers with native potentates, and matters connected with\r\nhome policy. In point of literary character this work very nearly\r\nresembles the author's \"Peregrine Scramble.\" Indeed, the \"Seven Years'\r\nService\" is a sort of continuation of that book, without the form of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. JULES LECHEVALIER, known in this country chiefly as one of the foreign\r\nCorrespondents of _The Tribune_, but in Europe as an able writer on the\r\nSocial Sciences, has recently delivered in Paris and Berlin, and in\r\nLondon, (where he is residing as a political exile,) a series of\r\nlectures, which will soon be given to the world in a volume, upon the\r\nsubject of his favorite studies. M. Lechevalier's system, which he\r\ndenominates \"New Political Economy,\" is based upon the principle of\r\nassociation, in opposition to that of competition and _laissez-faire_,\r\nwhich constitute the groundwork of the school of the present political\r\neconomists. In the course of his series he pointed out the gradual\r\ntendency of the competitive principle to produce extremes of riches and\r\npoverty, and ultimately revolutions, and maintained, that by the adoption\r\nof the associative principle alone, society can be preserved from\r\nconfusion and destruction. He contends that the new political economy,\r\nor _Socialism_, is essentially Conservative, while the present system of\r\nunlimited competition, or buying cheap and selling dear, is destructive,\r\nM. Lechevalier pretends to base his system on the moral principles of\r\nChrist, and maintains that Christianity cannot be practically carried out\r\nin any other way. His lectures abound in examples of the working of the\r\ntwo opposing systems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Doctrinal Tract and Book Society, Boston, are going forward in the\r\nwork of re-publishing the old standard works of the New-England theology.\r\nThey have issued a fine edition of Bellamy and have procured an edition\r\nof Edwards the younger. They are now about commencing the stereotyping of\r\nCatlin's Compendium, and the whole works of Dr. Hopkins. We wish they\r\nwould go back a century further, and give us the best works of Mather and\r\nhis contemporaries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a political novel by OTTO MULLER, of Manheim, announced, under\r\nthe title _Georg Volker: ein Vreiheits Roman_, which is said to give a\r\nfaithful picture of the Baden revolution, and to open with the rise of\r\nthe peasantry in the _Ottenwald_.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *      *\r\n\r\nTHE DUC DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD's celebrated \"Moral Reflections, Sentences,\r\nand Maxims,\" have just appeared in a new and very much improved\r\ntranslation, and with notes, pointing out similarities of sentiments in\r\nancient and modern authors, and sometimes proving that Rochefoucauld's\r\ngood things have been made use of without sufficient acknowledgment, by\r\nmoderns. There is also an introduction, which dissertates well on the\r\npurpose and quality of the reflections. Such books were once very\r\npopular; but in this country they have not been much read. We have indeed\r\nhad numerous editions of \"Lacon,\" and Dr. Bettner's \"Acton\" has found a\r\nthousand purchasers; but the Rev. Dr. Hooker's \"Maxims,\" which, in our\r\nopinion, are as good as anything of their kind in the English language,\r\nwe believe have not attracted attention, and Mr. Simms's \"Egeria\" has\r\nbeen printed only in the columns of a newspaper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new theory has just been propounded at Paris in a book called\r\n\"Armanase,\" (a Sanscrit word, meaning the \"Reign of Capacity\"). The author\r\nasserts the present forms of administrative government are injurious\r\ninstead of useful to society, and ought to be replaced by institutions of\r\na new and different order. His principle is, that the sovereignty of the\r\nindividual ought to be instituted for that of governments, and that great\r\nassociations of mutual assurance may be advantageously substituted for\r\nthe existing system of management by office-holders. The author shows\r\nalso that the progress of the natural and mechanical sciences will\r\ndeliver man from the pressure of the more painful sorts of labor; and\r\nthat wealth, freed from the barriers which now hinder its circulation,\r\nwould be distributed freely throughout society. Intellectual property\r\nwould be seriously guaranteed, and would enrich the men of genius, whose\r\ninventions and discoveries are now profitable, not to the authors, but to\r\nthe capitalists who take advantage of them. By this means an important\r\nelement of revolutions will be removed. The author proposes, that in\r\norder to prevent all suffering, a civil list shall be set apart for the\r\npeople, who will be the king. This civil list is to be composed of a tax\r\nof one per cent., levied on all who have property in favor of those who\r\nhave nothing. But, says he, let no one imagine that all would be\r\ndissolution and ruin in this system, without law or government. Crimes\r\nand offenses will be tried by juries, that is to say, by a living code.\r\nProperty will no longer be seizable for debt, and the courts will become\r\nuseless. Everybody shall have the absolute right to buy land by paying\r\nits possessor ten per cent, on its value: this is to give a chance for\r\ncarrying on all sorts of grand public enterprises without trouble from\r\nthe proprietors of little pieces of land. It may perhaps be doubted,\r\nwhether the \"Reign of Capacity\" has exhibited any astonishing endowments\r\nin that respect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY, in _Pendennis_, has given offense, it appears, to some of the\r\ngensd'armes of the Press, by his satirical sketches of the literary\r\nprofession. Those whose withers are unwrung will admit the truth of many\r\npages and laugh at the caricature in the rest. In the last number of the\r\n_North British Review_ is a clever article upon the subject, written with\r\ngood temper and good sense. Hitherto publishers have been ridiculed and\r\ndeclaimed against as \"tyrants\" and \"tradesmen,\"--made to bear the onus of\r\n\"poetical\" improvidence, and to sustain the weight of a crime which no\r\nauthor can pardon--the rejection of manuscripts. The _authors_ have\r\npainted the portraits of publishers; but an ancient fable suggests that\r\nif the _lion_ had painted a certain picture, it would not have been a\r\nlion we should see biting the dust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. DE LUYNES is now engaged at Paris in publishing a work on the\r\nantiquities of Cyprus. He has discovered a number of inscriptions\r\nin ancient Cyprian writing, and is having them engraved on copper. The\r\nwriting is that which preceded the introduction of the Phoenician\r\ncharacter upon the island, and seems to have no affinity either with that\r\nor with the Assyrian, which is discovered to have been once used there.\r\nThe work of M. de Luynes will open a new problem for the philologists. It\r\nwill be difficult to decipher the inscriptions and language, unless there\r\ncan be found somewhere an ancient Cyprian inscription, with a translation\r\nin some known tongue; but in a time which has read the riddles of the\r\npyramids, nothing of this sort is to be despaired of. M. de Luynes is the\r\nlast of the great French nobles who makes a worthy use of his riches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT PEEL left full and specific directions in his will for the\r\nearly publication of his political memoirs; and ordered that the profits\r\narising from the publication shall be given to some public institution\r\nfor the education of the working-classes. He believed his manuscripts and\r\ncorrespondence to be of great value, as showing the characters of the\r\ngreat men of his age; and directed that his correspondence with the Queen\r\nand Prince Albert shall not be published during their lives without their\r\nexpress consent. He confided the task of preparing these memoirs to Lord\r\nMahon and Mr. Cardwell. Their duty will, however, be comparatively light,\r\nthough delicate, from the admirable and orderly state in which he left\r\nhis papers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

BURNET DE PESLE has just published the first part of his _Examen\r\nCritique de la Succession des Dynasties Egyptiennes_, a work to which\r\ncompetent critics assign a high value. He follows the method of\r\nChampollion, rejecting hypotheses and admitting only the testimony of the\r\nhistorians and monuments. At the same time he treats his subject with\r\nindependence and originality, though he advances nothing for the sake of\r\nnovelty. The second part of the work will be devoted to the discussion of\r\nthe ancient inscriptions, dynasty by dynasty, and reign by reign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON IRVING is claimed by the English as by both _birth_ and spirit\r\na British author. In the question of copyright lately before the Vice\r\nChancellor, the case rested in part upon a plea that Mr. Irving's father\r\nwas from the Orkneys and his mother from Falmouth, so that, though he was\r\nborn in New York, he was not an _alien_. Still, our \"Diedrich\r\nKnickerbocker\" was _Colonel_ Irving once, and served in this capacity\r\nagainst the king, and it will not he safe for him to establish the\r\nposition assumed by his publisher.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

It is said to be a curious work which will\r\nenlighten much that is yet dark in the history of that period, throwing\r\nadditional obloquy upon some members, and relieving others of a portion\r\nof that which they have hitherto borne. M. Chemiega is also engaged upon\r\nhis own account in similar historical labors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR.

A writer in _The Leader_ answers after this\r\nwise:\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, she is somewhat of a myth, making her avatars in literature\r\nwith all the caprice and variety of Vishnou or Brougham; her maiden name\r\nof Rose Stewart has not, that we can discover, been stained with\r\nprinter's ink, but we trace her as 'Arthur Dudley' in the _Revue des\r\nDeux Mondes_ writing upon Bulwer and Dickens, we next find her as\r\n'Maurice Flassan' in _Les Français Aeints par eux-mémes_. Rumor further\r\nwhispereth that she had a finger in 'Albert Lunel,' one of the\r\neccentricities of an eccentric law-lord, which was hurriedly suppressed,\r\none knows not why; in the _Edinburgh Review_ she wrote a paper on\r\nMolière, and for Charles Knight's _Weekly Volume_ a pleasant little book\r\nabout Racine, on the title-page of which she is styled 'Madame Blaize\r\nBury;' since that time you observe she has blossomed into a Baroness _de_\r\nBury! Let us add that she is the wife of Henri Blaze, known as agreeable\r\ncritic and the translator of Faust, that she is said to be a great\r\nfavorite with the author of 'Albert Lunel,' and that she has the two\r\nnovels 'Mildred Vernon' and 'Leonie Vermont' placed to her account: how\r\nmany other shapes she may have assumed we know not; are these not enough?\r\nWhether, after all, a flesh-and-blood Madame de Bury exists is more than\r\nWe can decide. _Une supposition!_ what if, after all, she should turn out\r\nto be Lord Brougham himself? The restless energy of that Scottish\r\nPhenomenon renders everything possible. _He_ does not agree with Pliny's\r\nwitty friend, that it is better to be idle than to do nothing--_satius\r\nest otiosum esse quam nihil agere_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREV.

This critic\r\nis evidently honest and impartial, but not perfectly well informed. He\r\nsupposes that the majority of the artists as well as of the scholars in\r\nthe country are emigrants from Europe; and affirms that artists of great\r\ntalent, who have been esteemed and encouraged in Europe, have been\r\nreduced to misery in America, and compelled to resort to common labor for\r\ntheir living. Latterly, however, fashion has brought pictures into\r\nmarket; and we may now hear, in more refined circles, here and there a\r\nmisapplied artistic term, which shows that art is somewhat thought\r\nof. It is characteristic that an American will often bargain for pictures\r\nby the square foot. The New York Art Union has done a good deal of good\r\nin the culture of taste for art, and from the Philadelphia Art Union much\r\nmay also be expected. The daguerreotypes taken here may be compared with\r\nthe best of Voightländer of Vienna and Williams of Liverpool. The\r\ntalbotypes of this country are better than all others. Lithographing is\r\ndone mostly by French and Germans; wood-cutting and steel-engraving by\r\nEnglishmen and Americans. The products of the latter two resemble\r\nperfectly those of the same arts in England. Dramatic and musical art\r\nare in a feeble condition. The theaters in the great cities have been\r\nvisited by the writer, and nothing admirable found in them. They are all\r\nprivate enterprises, and no great things are to be expected in that line\r\nwithout the aid of a government. The theaters are built and furnished in\r\nthe most elegant and even luxurious style. The Italian Opera in New York\r\nis supplied by European artists whose best days are over. The actors\r\nnever rise to any commendable excellence, and the pieces they perform are\r\nwell adapted to their talents. Hardly ever is anything classical produced\r\nupon the stage.\r\n\r\nThe German drama in the United States is spoken of as being in a\r\ncondition of even more desperate degradation. The writer's remarks on\r\nthat subject will not specially interest our readers; but we trust that\r\nwhat we have given above from his strictures will be edifying to all whom\r\nit may concern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM ROME we hear of an extensive undertaking about to be commenced in\r\nthe way of Catholic Art. The plan is this: Overbeck, whose designs from\r\nScripture history are familiar to all lovers of Art who have not\r\noverlooked one of the most remarkable geniuses of the times, is now\r\nemployed upon fourteen compositions representing the fourteen Stations or\r\npauses of the Lord on his way to the cross. Part of them are already\r\ndone, and to judge from them the series will surpass all previous works\r\nof this great master. These designs are to be multiplied to the greatest\r\nextent and put within the means of churches, convents and even the\r\npoorest classes of the people. They will appear of the size of the\r\noriginal in colored lithography, which will probably be executed in\r\nGermany. Engravings of half size on copper are to be executed by the\r\neminent engraver Bartoccini, who is familiar with Overbeck's manner, and\r\nwho has worked under him in Germany. Indeed Bartoccini is already best\r\nknown from the engravings of Overbeck's designs to the New Testament, the\r\nbest of which were from his burin. In addition there are to be editions\r\nof these compositions in middling and small sizes as well as in wood\r\nengravings. The object is to provide something which has real artistic\r\nmerit in place of the wretched pictures which are offered for the\r\ndevotion of the faithful in so many churches and in Catholic\r\nprayer-books. The Pope himself, to whom the first colored drawings have\r\nbeen shown, takes a lively interest in the enterprise, and will probably\r\nrecommend it in a special circular to all the bishops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHARLES MULLER, a German sculptor, whose group, \"The Singer's Curse,\"\r\nReceived the second prize at the Exposition of 1849, at Paris, has\r\narrived in this country, where he proposes to take up his residence. The\r\n_Tribune_ states that \"The Singer's Curse\" will soon be exhibited to the\r\npublic in this city. It was suggested by one of the finest of Uhland's\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city of Paris is about to erect along the grand avenue of the Champs\r\nElysées three hundred statues, in marble, of Parisians distinguished in\r\nthe administration of the city, in letters, in science, the fine arts or\r\ncommerce. The statues will alternate with beautiful little fountains, and\r\nwill form rows on each side of the avenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOWER'S STATUE OF EVE is now-having been rescued from the waters off the\r\ncoast of Spain--on the way to New York, and it will soon be here. The\r\nPrince Demidoff has purchased the figure of the Greek Slave, originally\r\ncommenced for Mr. Robb of New Orleans, for £700, being £100 more than Mr.\r\nRobb was to have given for it. The Prince has placed it in a room by\r\nitself, in his palace at St. Donato, near Florence. He is one of the\r\nfinest critics of art now living, and his collection of masterpieces\r\nconstitutes to the man of taste one of the chief attractions of Italy.\r\nFrom a letter of Powers now before us, we learn that the model of his\r\n\"America\" was finished, and on the first of August the marble was about\r\nto be commenced, in the same size. This the sculptor and his friends\r\nthink will be his greatest work. We are happy in being able to mention a\r\nfact eminently honorable to a distinguished American gentleman, in this\r\nconnection. When the statue of Eve was lost, Powers wrote to the\r\nunderwriters to pay the insurance ($6000) to Mr. J.S. Preston of South\r\nCarolina, upon whom the loss was to fall; but Mr. Preston instantly upon\r\nhearing the circumstance directed that every cent of the money should\r\nbe sent to the artist, expressing only a regret that the country suffered\r\nthe loss of a performance so admirable. Mr. Powers had not at this time\r\nheard of the loss of the statue of Mr. Calhoun. This great work has not\r\nyet been recovered, but Mr. Kellogg has still hopes of its being rescued\r\nin perfect safety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Venice _Statuto_ of the 13th August announces that Venice and Italy\r\nhave experienced an irreparable loss. The celebrated Barbarigo Gallery,\r\nknown for ages, comprised amongst other masterpieces seventeen paintings\r\nof Titian, the Magdalen, Venus, St. Sebastian; the famous portraits of\r\nthe Doge Barbarigo, of Philip XIV., &c. After the extinction of the\r\nBarbarigo family, Count Nicholas Giustiniani, the brothers Barbaco, and\r\nthe merchants Benetti, who became proprietors of the collection,\r\npresented it to the Government. The Viceroy Raniere offered it for sale\r\nin 1847 to the Austrian Government, which refused to buy it. It has been\r\nlately purchased by the Court of Russia for five hundred and sixty\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPAINTING AND SCULPTURES of the early northern artists from the eighth to\r\nthe sixteenth century have just been discovered in great numbers in\r\nGothland, by Dr. Marilignis, of the Stockholm Royal Academy of Fine Arts.\r\nHe was sent to search for them by the Academy, and has spent eighteen\r\nmonths in his mission. A large proportion of the pictures were found in\r\nchapels built during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and were covered\r\nwith thick coats of plaster, which had to be removed with great care. The\r\nresults of Dr. Marilignis' investigations will be published by the\r\nSwedish Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE INAUGURATION OF THE STATUE OF LARREY, the famous surgeon of the\r\nImperial army, at the Val-de-Grace, took place in Paris lately. Among the\r\nassistants at this solemnity not the least interesting portion was a\r\ncorps of one hundred invalids upon whom Larrey had operated. The hero of\r\nthe day was Dupin, who walked in to the flourish of drums and trumpets at\r\nthe head of the commission of the monument. The statue of bronze, by\r\nDavid, of Angers, was unvailed amid the clang of \"sonorous metal blowing\r\nmartial sounds.\" Old Dupin, in a fit of happy inspiration, jumped up on\r\nthe chair from which he presided, and delivered perhaps the best speech\r\nhe ever made. He drew, in lively touches, the mission of the man whose\r\nhospital is the battle-field, of his intrepid coolness and humane\r\ndevotion. Larrey was wounded, while binding the wounds of others, in\r\nEgypt and at Waterloo, in the days of glory and of disaster. The\r\nPresident of the Assembly spoke with much feeling, and when he came down\r\nfrom his chair a general rush was made by his friends to embrace him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE STANDISH GALLERY OF PICTURES in the Louvre was decreed by the French\r\ncourts, a few days before his death, to be the private property of the\r\nlate Louis Philippe. It was left to the king by Mr. Frank Hall Standish,\r\nin 1838. The library of this collection is very valuable. It contains\r\namong other rare books the Bible of Cardinal Ximenes, valued alone at\r\n$5000. One of the last acts of Louis Philippe was to present it to the\r\nFrench people. He was desirous only of vindicating his rights in the\r\ncourts. The gallery therefore will not be removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF PICTURES by Düsseldorf artists was opened in\r\nthat city about the middle of July.

Ten pictures of peasant life in Norway by Adolf\r\nTidemond, a Norwegian artist, are said to display very remarkable merit.\r\nThey were retained in the exhibition only a few days, being destined for\r\nthe royal chateau of Oskarshall.

GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family of EDGAR A. POE was one of the oldest and most\r\nreputable in Baltimore. David Poe, his paternal grandfather, was a\r\nQuartermaster-General in the Maryland line during the Revolution, and the\r\nintimate friend of Lafayette, who, during his last visit to the United\r\nStates, called personally upon the General's widow, and tendered her\r\nacknowledgments for the services rendered to him by her husband. His\r\ngreat-grandfather, John Poe, married in England, Jane, a daughter of\r\nAdmiral James McBride, noted in British naval history, and claiming\r\nKindred with some of the most illustrious English families. His father,\r\nDavid Poe, jr., the fourth son of the Quartermaster-General, was several\r\nyears a law student in Baltimore, but becoming enamored of an English\r\nactress, named Elizabeth Arnold, whose prettiness and vivacity more than\r\nher genius for the stage made her a favorite, he eloped with her, and\r\nafter a short period, having married her, became himself an actor. They\r\ncontinued six or seven years in the theaters of the principal cities, and\r\nfinally died, within a few weeks of each other, in Richmond, leaving\r\nthree children, Henry, Edgar, and Rosalie, in utter destitution.\r\n\r\nEdgar Poe, who was born in Baltimore, in January, 1811, was at this\r\nperiod of remarkable beauty, and precocious wit. Mr. John Allan, a\r\nmerchant of large fortune and liberal disposition, who had been intimate\r\nwith his parents, having no children of his own, adopted him, and it was\r\ngenerally understood among his acquaintances that he intended to make him\r\nthe heir of his estate. The proud, nervous irritability of the boy's\r\nnature was fostered by his guardian's well-meant but ill-judged\r\nindulgence. Nothing was permitted which could \"break his spirit.\" He must\r\nbe the master of his masters, or not have any. An eminent and most\r\nestimable gentleman of Richmond has written to me, that when Poe was only\r\nsix or seven years of age, he went to a school kept by a widow of\r\nexcellent character, to whom was committed the instruction of the\r\nchildren of some of the principal families in the city. A portion of\r\nthe grounds was used for the cultivation of vegetables, and its invasion\r\nby her pupils strictly forbidden. A trespasser, if discovered, was\r\ncommonly made to wear, during school hours, a turnip or carrot, or\r\nsomething, of this sort, attached to his neck as a sign of disgrace. On\r\none occasion Poe, having violated the rules, was decorated with the\r\npromised badge, which he wore in sullenness until the dismissal of the\r\nboys, when, that the full extent of his wrong might be understood by his\r\npatron, of whose sympathy he was confident, he eluded the notice of the\r\nschoolmistress, who would have relieved him of his esculent, and made the\r\nbest of his way home, with it dangling at his neck. Mr. Allan's anger was\r\naroused, and he proceeded instantly to the school-room, and after\r\nlecturing the astonished dame upon the enormity of such an insult to his\r\nson and to himself, demanded his account, determined that the child\r\nshould not again be subject to such tyranny. Who can estimate the effect\r\nof this puerile triumph upon the growth of that morbid self-esteem which\r\ncharacterized the author in after life?\r\n\r\nIn 1816, he accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Allan to Great Britain, visited the\r\nmost interesting portions of the country, and afterward passed four or\r\nfive years in a school kept at Stoke Newington, near London, by the Rev.\r\nDr. Bransby. In his tale, entitled \"William Wilson,\" he has introduced a\r\nstriking description of this school and of his life here. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"My earliest recollections of a school life are connected with a\r\n  large, rambling Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of\r\n  England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and\r\n  where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a\r\n  dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this\r\n  moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its\r\n  deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand\r\n  shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep\r\n  hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each, hour, with sullen and\r\n  sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the\r\n  fretted Gothic steeple lay embedded and asleep. It gives me, perhaps,\r\n  as much of pleasure, as I can now in any manner experience to dwell\r\n  upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns. Steeped in\r\n  misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I shall be pardoned for\r\n  seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few\r\n  rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even\r\n  ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious\r\n  importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I\r\n  recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterward\r\n  so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember. The house. I have\r\n  said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive, and a high\r\n  and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass,\r\n  encompassed the whole. The prison-like rampart formed the limit of our\r\n  domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every Saturday\r\n  afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take\r\n  brief walks in a body through some of the neighboring fields--and\r\n  twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to\r\n  the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of\r\n  this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a\r\n  spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our\r\n  remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended\r\n  the pulpit! This reverend man with countenance so demurely benign,\r\n  with robes so glossy, and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely\r\n  powdered, so rigid and so vast,--could this be he who, of late, with\r\n  sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,\r\n  the Draconian Laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly\r\n  monstrous for solution! At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a\r\n  more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and\r\n  surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did\r\n  it inspire! It was never opened save for the three periodical\r\n  egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of\r\n  its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery--a world of matter\r\n  for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation. The extensive\r\n  inclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of\r\n  these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It\r\n  was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had\r\n  no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it\r\n  was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted\r\n  with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed\r\n  only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first advent to school or\r\n  final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having\r\n  called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or\r\n  Midsummer holidays. But the house!--how quaint an old building was\r\n  this!--to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really\r\n  no end to its windings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was\r\n  difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its\r\n  two stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there\r\n  were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.\r\n  Then the lateral branches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so\r\n  returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to\r\n  the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we\r\n  pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I\r\n  was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality\r\n  lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen\r\n  or twenty other scholars. The school-room was the largest in the\r\n  house--I could not help thinking, in the world. It was very long,\r\n  narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of\r\n  oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square inclosure of\r\n  eight or ten feet, comprising the _sanctum_, 'during hours,' of our\r\n  principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with\r\n  massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the 'Dominie,' we\r\n  would all have willingly perished by the _peine forte et dure_. In\r\n  other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced,\r\n  indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit\r\n  of the 'classical' usher, one of the 'English and mathematical.'\r\n  Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless\r\n  irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient and\r\n  time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so\r\n  beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque\r\n  figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have\r\n  entirely lost what little of original form might have been their\r\n  portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one\r\n  extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  \"Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed,\r\n  yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my\r\n  life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of\r\n  incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of\r\n  a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth\r\n  has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must\r\n  believe that my first mental development had in it much of the\r\n  uncommon--even much of the _outre_. Upon mankind at large the events\r\n  of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite\r\n  impression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an\r\n  indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.\r\n  With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy\r\n  of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as\r\n  deep; and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian medals. Yet\r\n  the fact--in the fact of the world's view-how little was there to\r\n  remember. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the\r\n  connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays and\r\n  perambulations; the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\r\n  intrigues; these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\r\n  involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an\r\n  universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\r\n  spirit-stirring. '_Oh, le bon temps, que se siecle de fer!_'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1822, he returned to the United States, and after passing a few\r\nmonths at an academy in Richmond, he entered the University at\r\nCharlottesville, where he led a very dissipated life; the manners which\r\nthen prevailed there were extremely dissolute, and he was known as the\r\nwildest and most reckless student of his class; but his unusual\r\nopportunities, and the remarkable ease with which he mastered the most\r\ndifficult studies, kept him all the while in the first rank for\r\nscholarship, and he would have graduated with the highest honors, had\r\nnot his gambling, intemperance, and other vices, induced his expulsion\r\nfrom the university.\r\n\r\nAt this period he was noted for feats of hardihood, strength, and\r\nactivity; and on one occasion, in a hot day of June, he swam from\r\nRichmond to Warwick, seven miles and a half, against a tide running\r\nprobably from two to three miles an hour.[A] He was expert at fence, had\r\nsome skill in drawing, and was a ready and eloquent conversationist and\r\ndeclaimer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This statement was first printed during Mr. Poe's lifetime,\r\nand its truth being questioned in some of the journals, the following\r\ncertificate was published by a distinguished gentleman of Virginia:\r\n\r\n\"I was one of several who witnessed this swimming feat. We accompanied\r\nMr. Poe in boats. Messrs. Robert Stannard, John Lyle, (since dead) Robert\r\nSaunders, John Munford, I think, and one or two others, were also of the\r\nparty. Mr. P. did not seem at all fatigued, and _walked_ back to Richmond\r\nimmediately after the feat--which was undertaken for a wager.\r\n\r\n\"ROBERT G. CABELL.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis allowance of money while at Charlottesville had been liberal, but he\r\nquitted the place very much in debt; and when Mr. Allan refused to accept\r\nsome of the drafts with which he had paid losses in gaming, he wrote to\r\nhim an abusive letter, quitted his house, and soon after left the country\r\nwith the quixotic intention of joining the Greeks, then in the midst of\r\ntheir struggle with the Turks. He never reached his destination, and we\r\nknow but little of his adventures in Europe for nearly a year. By the end\r\nof this time he had made his way to St. Petersburg, and our Minister in\r\nthat capital, the late Mr. Henry Middleton, of South Carolina, was\r\nummoned one morning to save him from penalties incurred in a drunken\r\ndebauch. Through Mr. Middleton's kindness he was set at liberty and\r\nenabled to return to this country.\r\n\r\nHis meeting with Mr. Allan was not very cordial, but that gentleman\r\ndeclared himself willing to serve him in any way that should seem\r\njudicious; and when Poe expressed some anxiety to enter the Military\r\nAcademy, he induced Chief Justice Marshall, Andrew Stevenson, General\r\nScott, and other eminent persons, to sign an application which secured\r\nhis appointment to a scholarship in that institution.\r\n\r\nMrs. Allan, whom Poe appears to have regarded with much affection, and\r\nwho had more influence over him than any one else at this period, died on\r\nthe 27th of February, 1829, which I believe was just before Poe left\r\nRichmond for West Point. It has been erroneously stated by all Poe's\r\nbiographers, that Mr. Allan was now sixty-five years of age, and that\r\nMiss Paterson, to whom he was married afterward, was young enough to be\r\nhis granddaughter. Mr. Allan was in his forty-eighth year, and the\r\ndifference between his age and that of his second wife was not so great\r\nas justly to attract any observation.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks the cadet applied himself with much assiduity to his\r\nstudies, and he became at once a favorite with his mess and with the\r\nofficers and professors of the Academy; but his habits of dissipation\r\nwere renewed; he neglected his duties and disobeyed orders; and in ten\r\nmonths from his matriculation he was cashiered.\r\n\r\nHe went again to Richmond, and was received into the family of Mr. Allan,\r\nwho was disposed still to be his friend, and in the event of his good\r\nbehavior to treat him like a son; but it soon became necessary to close\r\nhis doors against him forever. According to Poe's own statement he\r\nridiculed the marriage of his patron with Miss Paterson, and had a\r\nquarrel with her; but a different story,[B] scarcely suitable for\r\nrepetition here, was told by the friends of the other party. Whatever the\r\ncircumstances, they parted in anger, and Mr. Allan from that time\r\ndeclined to see or in any way to assist him. Mr. Allan died in the spring\r\nof 1834, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, leaving three children to\r\nshare his property, of which not a mill was bequeathed to Poe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The writer of an eulogium upon the life and genius of Mr.\r\nPoe, in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, for March, 1850, thus refers\r\nto this point in his history:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The story of the other side is different: and if true, throws a dark\r\nshade upon the quarrel, and a very ugly light upon Poe's character. We\r\nshall not insert it, because it is one of those relations, which we\r\nthink, with Sir Thomas Browne, should never be recorded,--being\r\n'verities whose truth we fear and heartily wish there were no truth\r\ntherein ... whose relations honest minds do deprecate. For of sins\r\nheteroclital, and such as want name or precedent, there is ofttimes a sin\r\neven in their history. We do desire no record of enormities: sins should\r\nhe accounted new. They omit of their monstrosity as they fall from their\r\nrarity; for men count it venial to err with their forefathers, and\r\nfoolishly conceive they divide a sin in its society.... In things of this\r\nnature, silence commendeth history: 'tis the veniable part of things\r\nlost; wherein there must never arise a Pancirollus, nor remain any\r\nregister but that of hell.'\"]\r\n\r\nSoon after he left West Point Poe had printed at Baltimore a small volume\r\nof verses, (\"Al Aaraaf,\" of about four hundred lines, \"Tamerlane,\" of\r\nabout three hundred lines, with smaller pieces,) and the favorable manner\r\nin which it was commonly referred to confirmed his belief that he might\r\nsucceed in the profession of literature. The contents of the book appear\r\nto have been written when he was between sixteen and nineteen years of\r\nage; but though they illustrated the character of his abilities and\r\njustified his anticipations of success, they do not seem to me to evince,\r\nall things considered, a very remarkable precocity. The late Madame\r\nd'Ossoli refers to some of them as the productions of a boy of eight or\r\nten years, but I believe there is no evidence that anything of his which\r\nhas been published was written before he left the university. Certainly,\r\nit was his habit so constantly to labor upon what he had produced--he was\r\nat all times so anxious and industrious in revision--that his works,\r\nwhenever first composed, displayed the perfection of his powers at the\r\ntime when they were given to the press.\r\n\r\nHis contributions to the journals attracted little attention, and his\r\nhopes of gaining a living in this way being disappointed, he enlisted\r\nin the army as a private soldier. How long he remained in the service I\r\nhave not been able to ascertain. He was recognized by officers who had\r\nknown him at West Point and efforts were made, privately, but with\r\nprospects of success, to obtain for him a commission, when it was\r\ndiscovered by his friends that he had deserted.\r\n\r\nHe had probably found relief from the monotony of a soldier's life in\r\nliterary composition. His mind was never in repose, and without some such\r\nresort the dull routine of camp or barracks would have been\r\ninsupportable. When he next appears, he has a volume of MS. stories,\r\nwhich he desires to print under the title of \"Tales of the Folio Club.\"\r\nAn offer by the proprietor of the Baltimore _Saturday Visitor_, of two\r\nprizes, one for the best tale and one for the best poem, induced him to\r\nsubmit the pieces entitled \"MS. Found in a Bottle,\" \"Lionizing,\" \"The\r\nVisionary,\" and three others, with \"The Coliseum,\" a poem, to the\r\ncommittee, which consisted of Mr. John P. Kennedy, the author of\r\n\"Horse-Shoe Robinson;\" Mr. J.H.B. Latrobe, and Dr. James H. Miller. Such\r\nmatters are usually disposed of in a very off-hand way: Committees to\r\naward literary prizes drink to the payer's health in good wines, over\r\nunexamined MSS., which they submit to the discretion of publishers, with\r\npermission to use their names in such a way as to promote the publishers'\r\nadvantage. So perhaps it would have been in this case, but that one of\r\nthe committee, taking up a little book remarkably beautiful and distinct\r\nin caligraphy, was tempted to read several pages; and becoming\r\ninterested, he summoned the attention of the company to the half-dozen\r\ncompositions it contained. It was unanimously decided that the prizes\r\nshould be paid to \"the first of geniuses who had written legibly.\" Not\r\nanother MS. was unfolded. Immediately the \"confidential envelope\" was\r\nopened, and the successful competitor was found to bear the\r\nscarcely-known name of Poe. The committee indeed awarded to him the\r\npremiums for both the tale and the poem, but subsequently altered their\r\ndecision, so as to exclude him from the second premium, in consideration\r\nof his having obtained the higher one. The prize tale was the \"MS. found\r\nin a Bottle.\" This award was published on the twelfth of October, 1833.\r\nThe next day the publisher called to see Mr. Kennedy, and gave him an\r\naccount of the author, which excited his curiosity and sympathy, and\r\ncaused him to request that he should be brought to his office.\r\nAccordingly he was introduced. The prize-money had not yet been paid, and\r\nhe was in the costume in which he had answered the advertisement of his\r\ngood fortune. Thin, and pale even to ghastliness, his whole appearance\r\nindicated sickness and the utmost destitution. A well-worn frock-coat\r\nconcealed the absence of a shirt, and imperfect boots disclosed the want\r\nof hose. But the eyes of the young man were luminous with intelligence\r\nand feeling, and his voice and conversation and manner, all won upon the\r\nlawyer's regard. Poe told his history, and his ambition, and it was\r\ndetermined that he should not want means for a suitable appearance in\r\nsociety, nor opportunities for just display of his abilities in\r\nliterature. Mr. Kennedy accompanied him to a clothing-store, and\r\npurchased for him a respectable suit, with changes of linen, and sent him\r\nto a bath, from which he returned with the suddenly regained style of a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nHis new friends were very kind to him, and availed themselves of every\r\nOpportunity to serve him. Near the close of the year 1834 the late Mr.\r\nT.W. White established in Richmond the _Southern Literary Messenger_. He\r\nwas a man of much simplicity, purity, and energy of character, but not a\r\nwriter, and he frequently solicited his acquaintances' literary\r\nassistance. On receiving from him an application for an article, early in\r\n1835, Mr. Kennedy, who was busy with the duties of his profession,\r\nadvised Poe to send one, and in a few weeks he had occasion to inclose\r\nthe following answer to a letter from Mr. White:\r\n\r\n\"BALTIMORE, April 13, 1835.\r\n\r\n\"_Dear Sir_: Poe did right in referring to me. He is very clever with his\r\npen--classical and scholarlike. He wants experience and direction, but I\r\nhave no doubt he can be made very useful to you. And, poor fellow! he is\r\n_very_ poor. I told him to write something for every number of your\r\nmagazine, and that you might find it to your advantage to give him some\r\npermanent employ. He has a volume of very bizarre tales in the hands of\r\n----, in Philadelphia, who for a year past has been promising to publish\r\nthem. This young fellow is highly imaginative, and a little given to the\r\n_terrific_. He is at work upon a tragedy, but I have turned him to\r\ndrudging upon whatever may make money, and I have no doubt you and he\r\nwill find your account in each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next number of the \"Messenger\" Mr. White announced that Poe was\r\nits editor, or in other words, that he had made arrangements with a\r\ngentleman of approved literary taste and attainments to whose especial\r\nmanagement the editorial department would be confided, and it was\r\ndeclared that this gentleman would \"devote his exclusive attention to\r\nthe work.\" Poe continued, however, to reside in Baltimore, and it is\r\nprobable that he was engaged only as a general contributor and a writer\r\nof critical notices of books. In a letter to Mr. White, under the date of\r\nthe thirtieth of May, he says:\r\n\r\n\"In regard to my critique of Mr. Kennedy's novel, I seriously feel\r\nashamed of what I have written. I fully intended to give the work a\r\nthorough review, and examine it in detail. Ill health alone prevented me\r\nfrom so doing. At the time I made the hasty sketch I sent you, I was so\r\nill as to be hardly able to see the paper on which I wrote, and I\r\nfinished it in a state of complete exhaustion. I have not, therefore,\r\ndone anything like justice to the book, and I am vexed about the matter,\r\nfor Mr. Kennedy has proved himself a kind friend to me in every respect,\r\nand I am sincerely grateful to him for many acts of generosity and\r\nattention. You ask me if I am perfectly, satisfied with your course. I\r\nreply that I am--entirely. My poor services are not worth what you give\r\nme for them.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterward he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"You ask me if I would be willing to come on to Richmond if you should\r\nhave occasion, for my services during the coming winter. I reply that\r\nnothing would give me greater pleasure. I have been desirous for some\r\ntime past of paying a visit to Richmond, and would be glad of an\r\nreasonable excuse for so doing. Indeed I am anxious to settle myself in\r\nthat city, and if, by any chance, you hear of a situation likely to suit\r\nme, I would gladly accept it, were the salary even the merest trifle. I\r\nshould, indeed, feel myself greatly indebted to you if through your means\r\nI could accomplish this object. What you say in the conclusion of your\r\nletter, in relation to the supervision of proof-sheets, gives me reason\r\nto hope that possibly you might find something for me to do in your\r\noffice. If so I should be very glad--for at present only a very small\r\nportion of my time is employed.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued in Baltimore till September. In this period he wrote several\r\nlong reviews, which for the most part were rather abstracts of works than\r\ncritical discussions, and published, with others, \"Hans Phall,\" a story\r\nin some respects very similar to Mr. Locke's celebrated account of\r\nHerschel's Discoveries in the Moon. At first he appears to have been ill\r\nsatisfied with Richmond, or with his duties, for in two or three weeks\r\nafter his removal to that city we find Mr. Kennedy writing to him:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to see you in such plight as your letter shows you in. It is\r\nstrange that just at this time, when everybody is praising you, and when\r\nfortune is beginning to smile upon your hitherto wretched circumstances,\r\nyou should be invaded by those blue devils. It belongs, however, to your\r\nage and temper to be thus buffeted--but be assured, it only wants a\r\nlittle resolution to master the adversary forever. You will doubtless do\r\nwell henceforth in literature, and add to your _comforts_ as well as to\r\nyour reputation, which it gives me great pleasure to assure you is\r\neverywhere rising in popular esteem.\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not bear his good fortune. On receiving a month's salary he\r\ngave himself up to habits which only necessity had restrained at\r\nBaltimore. For a week he was in a condition of brutish drunkenness, and\r\nMr. White dismissed him. When he became sober, however, he had no\r\nrecourse but in reconciliation, and he wrote letters and induced\r\nacquaintances to call upon Mr. White with professions of repentance and\r\npromises of reformation. With his usual considerate and judicious\r\nkindness that gentleman answered him:\r\n\r\n\"_My dear Edgar_: I cannot address you in such language as this occasion\r\nand my feelings demand: I must be content to speak to you in my plain\r\nway. That you are sincere in all your promises I firmly believe. But when\r\nyou once again tread these streets, I have my fears that your resolutions\r\nwill fail, and that you will again drink till your senses are lost. If\r\nyou rely on your strength you are gone. Unless you look to your Maker for\r\nhelp you will not be safe. How much I regretted parting from you is known\r\nto Him only and myself. I had become attached to you; I am still; and I\r\nwould willingly say return, did not a knowledge of your past life make me\r\ndread a speedy renewal of our separation. If you would make yourself\r\ncontented with quarters in my house, or with any other private family,\r\nwhere liquor is not used, I should think there was some hope for you.\r\nBut, if you go to a tavern, or to any place where it is used at table,\r\nyou are not safe. You have fine talents, Edgar, and you ought to have\r\nthem respected, as well as yourself. Learn to respect yourself, and you\r\nwill soon find that you are respected. Separate yourself from the bottle,\r\nand from bottle companions, forever. Tell me if you can and will do so.\r\nIf you again become an assistant in my office, it must be understood that\r\nall engagements on my part cease the moment you get drunk. I am your true\r\nfriend, T. W. W.\"\r\n\r\nA new contract was arranged, but Poe's irregularities frequently\r\ninterrupted the kindness and finally exhausted the patience of his\r\ngenerous though methodical employer, and in the number of the \"Messenger\"\r\nfor January, 1837 he thus took leave of its readers:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Poe's attention being called in another direction, he will decline,\r\nwith the present number, the editorial duties of the Messenger. His\r\nCritical Notices for this month end with Professor Anthon's Cicero-what\r\nfollows is from another hand. With the best wishes to the magazine, and\r\nto its few foes as well as many friends, he is now desirous of bidding\r\nall parties a peaceful farewell.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Richmond, with an income of but five hundred dollars a year, he\r\nhad married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a very amiable and lovely girl,\r\nwho was as poor as himself, and little fitted, except by her gentle\r\ntemper, to be tho wife of such a person. He went from Richmond to\r\nBaltimore; and after a short time, to Philadelphia, and to New York. A\r\nslight acquaintance with Dr. Hawks had led that acute and powerful writer\r\nto invite his contributions to the \"New York Review,\" and he had\r\nfurnished for the second number of it (for October, 1837) an elaborate\r\nbut not very remarkable article upon Stephens's then recently published\r\n\"Incidents of Travel in Egypt, Arabia Petrea, and the Holy Land.\" His\r\nabilities were not of the kind demanded for such work, and he never wrote\r\nanother paper for this or for any other Review of the same class. He had\r\ncommenced in the \"Literary Messenger,\" a story of the sea under the title\r\nof \"Arthur Gordon Pym\"[A], and upon the recommendation of Mr. Paulding\r\nand others, it was printed by the Harpers. It is his longest work, and is\r\nnot without some sort of merit, but it received little attention. The\r\npublishers sent one hundred copies to England, and being mistaken at\r\nfirst for a narrative of real experiences it was advertised to be\r\nreprinted, but a discovery of its character, I believe, prevented such a\r\nresult. An attempt is made in it, by simplicity of style, minuteness of\r\nnautical descriptions, and circumstantiality of narration, to give it\r\nthat air of truth which constitutes the principal attraction of Sir\r\nEdward Seaward's narrative, and Robinson Cursoe; but it has none of the\r\npleasing interest of these tales; it is as full of wonders as Munchausen,\r\nhas as many atrocities as the Book of Pirates, and as liberal an array of\r\npaining and revolting horrors as ever was invented by Anne Radcliffe or\r\nGeorge Walker. Thus far a tendency to extravagance had been the most\r\nstriking infirmity of his genius. He had been more anxious to be intense\r\nthan to be natural; and some of his _bizarréries_ had been mistaken for\r\nsatire, and admired for that quality. Afterward he was more judicious,\r\nand if his outlines were incredible it was commonly forgotten in the\r\nsimplicity of his details and their cohesive cumulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: THE NARRATIVE OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM, OF NANTUCKET; comprising\r\nthe Details of a Mutiny and Atrocious Butchery on board the American Brig\r\nGrampus, on her way to the South Seas--with an account of the Re-capture\r\nof the Vessel by the Survivors; their Shipwreck, and subsequent Horrible\r\nSufferings from Famine; their Deliverance by means of the British\r\nschooner Jane Gray; the brief Cruise of this latter Vessel in the\r\nAntarctic ocean; her Capture, and the Massacre of the Crew among a Group\r\nof Islands in the 84th parallel of southern latitude; together with the\r\nincredible Adventures and Discoveries still further South, to which that\r\ndistressing calamity gave rise.--I vol. 12mo. pp. 198 New-York, Harper &\r\nBrothers, 1838.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of the year 1838 he settled in Philadelphia. He had no very\r\nDefinite purposes, but trusted for support to the chances of success as a\r\nmagazinist and newspaper correspondent. Mr. Burton, the comedian, had\r\nrecently established the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" and of this he became a\r\ncontributor, and in May, 1839, the chief editor, devoting to it, for ten\r\ndollars a week, two hours every day, which left him abundant time for\r\nmore important labors. In the same month he agreed to furnish such\r\nreviewals as he had written for the \"Literary Messenger,\" for the\r\n\"Literary Examiner,\" a new magazine at Pittsburgh. But his more congenial\r\npursuit was tale-writing, and he produced about this period some of his\r\nmost remarkable and characteristic works in a department of imaginative\r\ncomposition in which he was henceforth alone and unapproachable. \"The Fall\r\nof the House of Usher\" and \"Legeia\", are the most interesting\r\nillustrations of his mental organization--his masterpieces in a peculiar\r\nvein of romantic creation. They have theunquestionable stamp of genius.\r\nThe analyses of the growth of madness in one, and the thrilling\r\nrevelations of the existence of a first wife in the person of a second,\r\nin the other, are made with consummate skill; and the strange and solemn\r\nand fascinating beauty which informs the style and invests the\r\ncircumstances of both, drugs the mind, and makes us forget the\r\nimprobabilities of their general design.\r\n\r\nAn awakened ambition and the healthful influence of a conviction that his\r\nworks were appreciated, and that his fame was increasing, led him for a\r\nwhile to cheerful views of life, and to regular habits of conduct. He\r\nwrote to a friend, the author of \"Edge Hill,\" in Richmond, that he had\r\nquite overcome \"the seductive and dangerous besetment\" by which he had so\r\noften been prostrated, and to another friend that, incredible as it might\r\nseem, he had become a \"model of temperance,\" and of \"other virtues,\"\r\nwhich it had sometimes been difficult for him to practice. Before the\r\nclose of the summer, however, he relapsed into his former courses, and\r\nfor weeks was regardless of everything but a morbid and insatiable\r\nappetite for the means of intoxication.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn he published all the prose stories he had then written, in\r\ntwo volumes, under the title of \"Tales of the Grotesque and the\r\nArabesque.\" The work was not salable, perhaps because its contents were\r\ntoo familiar from recent separate publication in magazines; and it was\r\nnot so warmly praised, generally, as I think it should have been, though\r\nin point of style the pieces which it embraced are much less perfect than\r\nthey were made subsequently.\r\n\r\nHe was with Mr. Burton until June, 1840--more than a year. Mr. Burton\r\nAppreciated his abilities and would have gladly continued the connection;\r\nbut Poe was so unsteady of purpose and so unreliable that the actor was\r\nnever sure when he left the city that his business would be cared for. On\r\none occasion, returning after the regular day of publication, he found\r\nthe number unfinished, and Poe incapable of duty. He prepared the\r\nnecessary copy himself, published the magazine, and was proceeding with\r\narrangements with for another month, when he received a letter from his\r\nassistant, of which the tone may be inferred from this answer:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you have thought it necessary to send me such a letter. Your\r\ntroubles have given a morbid tone to your feelings which it is your duty\r\nto discourage. I myself have been as severely handled by the world as you\r\ncan possibly have been, but my sufferings have not tinged my mind with\r\nmelancholy, nor jaundiced my views of society. You must rouse your\r\nenergies, and if care assail you, conquer it. I will gladly overlook the\r\npast. I hope you will as easily fulfill your pledges for the future. We\r\nshall agree very well, thought I cannot permit the magazine to be made a\r\nvehicle for that sort of severity which you think is so 'successful with\r\nthe mob.' I am truly much less anxious about making a monthly 'sensation'\r\nthan I am upon the point of fairness. You must, my dear sir, get rid of\r\nyour avowed ill-feelings toward your brother authors. You see I speak\r\nplainly; I cannot do otherwise upon such a subject. You say the people\r\nlove havoc. I think they love justice. I think you yourself would not\r\nhave written the article on Dawes, in a more healthy state of mind. I am\r\nnot trammeled by any vulgar consideration of expediency; I would rather\r\nlose money than by such undue severity wound the feelings of a\r\nkind-hearted and honorable man. And I am satisfied that Dawes has\r\nsomething the true fire in him. I regretted your word-catching spirit.\r\nBut I wander from my design. I accept your proposition to recommence your\r\ninterrupted avocations upon the _Maga_. Let us meet as if we had not\r\nexchanged letters. Use more exercise, write when feelings prompt, and be\r\nassured of my friendship. You will soon regain a healthy activity of\r\nmind, and laugh at your past vagaries.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was kind and judicious. It gives us a glimpse of Poe's theory\r\nof criticism, and displays the temper and principles of the literary\r\ncomedian in an honorable light. Two or three months afterward Burton went\r\nout of town to fulfill a professional engagement, leaving material and\r\ndirections for completing the next number of the magazine in four days.\r\nHe was absent nearly a fortnight, and on returning he found that his\r\nprinters in the meanwhile had not received a line of copy; but that Poe\r\nhad prepared the prospectus of a new monthly, and obtained transcripts of\r\nhis subscription and account books, to be used in a scheme for\r\nsupplanting him. He encountered his associate late in the evening at one\r\nof his accustomed haunts, and said, \"Mr. Poe, I am astonished: Give me my\r\nmanuscripts so that I can attend to the duties you have so shamefully\r\nneglected, and when you are sober we will settle.\" Poe interrupted him\r\nwith \"Who are you that presume to address me in this manner? Burton, I\r\nam--_the editor--of the Penn.--Magazine_--and you are--hiccup--_a fool_.\"\r\nOf course this ended his relations with the \"Gentleman's.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1840, Burton's miscellany was merged in \"The Casket,\" owned\r\nby Mr. George R. Graham, and the new series received the name of its\r\nproprietor, who encouraged Poe in its editorship. His connection with\r\n\"Graham's Magazine\" lasted about a year and a half, and this was one of\r\nthe most active and brilliant periods of his literary life. He wrote in\r\nit several of his finest tales and most trenchant criticisms, and\r\nchallenged attention by his papers entitled \"Autography,\" and those on\r\ncryptology and ciphers. In the first, adopting a suggestion of Lavater,\r\nhe attempted the illustration of character from handwriting; and in the\r\nsecond, he assumed that human ingenuity could construct no secret writing\r\nwhich human ingenuity could not resolve; a not very dangerous\r\nproposition, since it implied no capacity in himself to discover every\r\nriddle of this kind that should be invented. He however succeeded with\r\nseveral difficult cryptographs that were sent to him, and the direction\r\nof his mind to the subject led to the composition of some of the tales of\r\nratiocination which so largely increased his reputation. The infirmities\r\nwhich induced his separation from Mr. White and Mr. Burton at length\r\ncompelled Mr. Graham to seek for another editor; but Poe still remained\r\nin Philadelphia, engaged from time to time in various literary\r\noccupations, and in the vain effort to establish a journal of his own to\r\nbe called \"The Stylus.\" Although it requires considerable capital to\r\ncarry on a monthly of the description he proposed, I think it would not\r\nhave been difficult, with his well-earned fame as a magazinist, for him\r\nto have found a competent and suitable publisher, but for the unfortunate\r\nnotoriety of his habits, and the failure in succession of three persons\r\nwho had admired him for his genius and pitied him for his misfortunes, by\r\nevery means that tact or friendship could suggest, to induce the\r\nconsistency and steadiness of application indispensable to success in\r\nsuch pursuits. It was in the spring of 1848--more than a year after his\r\ndissociation from Graham--that he wrote the story of \"The Gold Bug,\" for\r\nwhich he was paid a prize of one hundred dollars. It has relation to\r\nCaptain Kyd's treasure, and is one of the most remarkable illustrations\r\nof his ingenuity of construction and apparent subtlety of reasoning. The\r\ninterest depends upon the solution of an intricate cypher. In the autumn\r\nof 1844 Poe removed to New York.\r\n\r\nIt was while he resided in Philadelphia that I became acquainted with\r\nhim. His manner, except during his fits of intoxication, was very quiet\r\nand gentlemanly; he was usually dressed with simplicity and elegance; and\r\nwhen once he sent for me to visit him, during a period of illness caused\r\nby protracted and anxious watching at the side of his sick wife, I was\r\nimpressed by the singular neatness and the air of refinement in his home.\r\nIt was in a small house, in one of the pleasant and silent neighborhoods\r\nfar from the center of the town, and though slightly and cheaply\r\nfurnished, everything in it was so tasteful and so fitly disposed that it\r\nseemed altogether suitable for a man of genius. For this and for most of\r\nthe comforts he enjoyed in his brightest as in his darkest years, he was\r\nchiefly indebted to his mother-in-law, who loved him with more than\r\nmaternal devotion and constancy.\r\n\r\nHe had now written his most acute criticisms and his most admirable\r\ntales. Of tales, beside those to which I have referred, he had produced\r\n\"The Descent into the Maelström,\" \"The Premature Burial,\" \"The Purloined\r\nLetter,\" \"The Murders of the Rue Morgue,\" and its sequel, \"The Mystery of\r\nMarie Roget.\" The scenes of the last three are in Paris, where the\r\nauthor's friend, the Chevalier Auguste Dupin, is supposed to reveal to\r\nhim the curiosities of his experience and observation in matters of\r\npolice. \"The Mystery of Marie Roget\" was first published in the autumn of\r\n1842, before an extraordinary excitement, occasioned by the murder of a\r\nyoung girl named Mary Rogers, in the vicinity of New York, had quite\r\nsubsided, though several months after the tragedy. Under the pretense of\r\nrelating the fate of a Parisian _grisette_, Mr. Poe followed in minute\r\ndetail the essential while merely paralleling the inessential facts of\r\nthe real murder. His object appears to have been to reinvestigate the\r\ncase and to settle his own conclusions as to the probable culprit. There\r\nis a great deal of hair-splitting in the incidental discussions by Dupin,\r\nthroughout all these stories, but it is made effective. Much of their\r\npopularity, as well as that of other tales of ratiocination by Poe, arose\r\nfrom their being in a new key. I do not mean to say that they are not\r\ningenious; but they have been thought more ingenious than they are, on\r\naccount of their method and air of method. In \"The Murders of the Rue\r\nMorgue,\" for instance, what ingenuity is displayed in unraveling a web\r\nwhich has been woven for the express purpose of unraveling? The reader is\r\nmade to confound the ingenuity of the supposititious Dupin with that of\r\nthe writer of the story. These works brought the name of Poe himself\r\nsomewhat conspicuously before the law courts of Paris. The journal, _La\r\nCommerce_, gave a _feuilleton_ in which \"The Murders of the Rue Morgue\"\r\nappeared in translation. Afterward a writer for _La Quotidienne_ served\r\nit for that paper under the title of \"_L'Orang-Otang_.\" A third party\r\naccused _La Quotidienne_ of plagiary from _La Commerce_, and in the\r\ncourse of the legal investigation which ensued, the _feuilletoniste_ of\r\n_La Commerce_ proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that he had\r\nstolen the tale entirely from Mr. Poe,[A] whose merits were soon after\r\ncanvassed in the \"_Revue des Deux Mondes_,\" and whose best tales were\r\nupon this impulse translated by Mme. Isabelle Meunier for the _Democratic\r\nPacifique_ and other French gazettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The controversy is wittily described in the following\r\nextract from a Parisian journal, _L'Entr*ficte_, of the 20th of October,\r\n1846:\r\n\r\n\"Un grand journal accusait l'autre jour M. Old-Nick d'avoir volé un\r\norang-outang. Cet intéressant animal flânait dans le feuilleton de _la\r\nQuotidienne_, lorsque M. Old-Nick le vit, le trouvâ à son goût et s'en\r\nempara. Notre confrère avait sans doute besoin d'un groom. On sait que\r\nles Anglais ont depuis long-temps colonisé les orangs-outangs, et les ont\r\ninstruits dans Part de porter bottes. Il paraitrait, toujours suivant le\r\nmeme grand journal, que M. Old-Nick, après avoir derobé cet orang-outang\r\nà _la Quotidienne_, l'aurait ensuite cédé au _Commerce_, comme propriété\r\nà lui appartenant. Je sais que M. Old-Nick est un garçon plein d'esprit\r\net plein d'honneur, assez riche de son propre fond pour ne pas\r\ns'approprier les orangs-outangs des autres; cette accusation me surprit.\r\nAprés tout, me dis-je, il y a éu des monomanies plus extraodinaires que\r\ncelle-là; le grand Bacon ne pouvait voir un bâton de cire à cacheter sans\r\nse l'approprier: dans une conférence avec M. de Metternich aux Tuileries,\r\nl'Empereur s'aperçut que le diplomate autrichien glissait des pains a\r\ncacheter dans sa poche. M. Old-Nick a une autre manic, il fait les\r\norangs-outangs. Je m'attendais toujours á ce que la _Quotidienne_ jeât\r\nfeu et flammes et demandat a grads cris son homme des bois. Il faut vous\r\ndire ques j'avaís la son histoire dans _le Commerce_, elle était\r\ncharmante d'esprit et de style, pleine de rapidité et de desinvolture;\r\n_la Quotidienne_ l'avait également publiée, mais en trois feuilletons.\r\nL'orang-outang du _Commerce_ n'avait que neuf colonnes. Il s'agissait\r\ndone d'un autre quadrumane litteraire. Ma foi non! c'etait le même;\r\nseulement il n'appartenait ni à _la Quotidienne_, ni au _Commerce_. M.\r\nOld-Nick l'avait emprunté a un romancier Américan qu'il est en train\r\nd'inventer dans la _Revue des Deux-Mondes_. Ce romancier s'appelle Poë;\r\nje ne dis pas contraire. Voilà done un écrivain qui use du droit légitime\r\nd'arranger les nouvelles d'un romancier Américan qu'il a inventé, et on\r\nl'accuse de plagiat, de vol au feuilleton; on alarme ses amis en leu\r\nfaisant croire que set ecrivain est possédé de la monomaine des\r\norangs-outangs. Par la Courchamps! voilà qui me parait léger. M. Old Nick\r\na écrit au journal en question une réponse pour rétablir sa moralité,\r\nattaquée à l'endroit des orangs-outangs. Cet orang-outang a mis, ces\r\njours derniers, toute la littérature en émoi; personne n'a cru un seul\r\ninstant à l'accusation qu'on a essayé, de faire peser sur M. Old Nick,\r\nd'autant plus qu'il avait pris soin d'indiquer luiméme la cage ou il\r\navait pris son orang-outang. Ceci va fournir de nouvelles armes à la\r\nsecte qui ereit aux romanciers Américans. Le préjugé de l'existence de\r\nCooper en prendra des nouvelles forces. En attendant que la vérité se\r\ndecouvre, nous sommes forcés de convenir que ce Poë est un gaillard bien\r\nfin, bien spirituel, quand il est arré par M. Old-Nick.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York Poe entered upon a new sort of life. Heretofore, from the\r\nCommencement of his literary career, he had resided in provincial\r\ntowns. Now he was in a metropolis, and with a reputation which might have\r\nserved as a passport to any society he might desire. For the first time\r\nhe was received into circles capable of both the appreciation and the\r\nproduction of literature. He added to his fame soon after he came to the\r\ncity by the publication of that remarkable composition \"The Raven,\" of\r\nwhich Mr. Willis has observed that in his opinion \"it is the most\r\neffective single example of fugitive poetry ever published in this\r\ncountry, and is unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception,\r\nmasterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of\r\nimaginative lift;\" and by that of one of the most extraordinary\r\ninstances of the naturalness of detail---the verisimilitude of minute\r\nnarrative--for which lie was preeminently distinguished, his \"Mesmeric\r\nRevelation,\" purporting to be the last conversation of a somnambule, held\r\nwith his magnetizer just before his death, which was followed by the yet\r\nmore striking exhibition of abilities in the same way, entitled \"The\r\nFacts in the case of M. Vaklemar,\" in which the subject is represented as\r\nhaving been mesmerized in _articulo mortis_. These pieces were reprinted\r\nthroughout the literary and philosophical world, in nearly all languages,\r\neverywhere causing sharp and curious speculation, and where readers could\r\nbe persuaded that they were fables, challenging a reluctant but genuine\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long in New York before he was engaged by Mr. Willis and\r\nGeneral Morris as a critic and assistant editor of _The Mirror_. He\r\nremained in this situation about six months, when he became associated\r\nwith Mr. Briggs in the conduct of _The Broadway Journal_, which, in\r\nOctober 1845, passed entirely into his possession. He had now the long\r\nsought but never before enjoyed absolute control of a literary gazette,\r\nand, with much friendly assistance, he maintained it long enough to show,\r\nthat whatever his genius, he had not the kind or degree of talent\r\nnecessary to such a position. His chief critical writing in _The Broadway\r\nJournal_, were a paper on Miss Barrett's Poems, and a long discussion of\r\nthe subject of plagiarism, with especial reference to Mr. Longfellow. In\r\nMarch, 1845, he had given a lecture at the Society Library upon the\r\nAmerican poets, composed, for the most part, of fragments of his\r\npreviously published reviewals; and in the autumn he accepted an\r\ninvitation to read a poem before the Boston Lyceum. A week after the\r\nevent, he printed in _The Broadway Journal_ the following account of it,\r\nin reply to a paragraph in one of the city papers, founded upon a\r\nstatement in the _Boston Transcript_.\r\n\r\n\"Our excellent friend, Major Noah, has suffered himself to be cajoled by\r\nthat most beguiling of all beguiling little divinities, Miss Walter, of\r\n_The Transcript_. We have been looking all over her article with the aid\r\nof a taper, to see if we could discover a single syllable of truth in\r\nit--and really blush to acknowledge that we cannot. The adorable creature\r\nhas been telling a parcel of fibs about us, by way of revenge for\r\nsomething that we did to Mr. Longfellow (who admires her very much) and\r\nfor calling her 'a pretty little witch' into the bargain. The facts of\r\nthe case seem to be these: We _were_ invited 'deliver'(stand and deliver)\r\na poem before the Boston Lyceum. As a matter of course, we accepted the\r\ninvitation. The audience was 'large and distinguished.' Mr Cushing[B]\r\npreceded us with a very capital discourse. He was much applauded. On\r\narising we were most cordially received. We occupied some fifteen minutes\r\nwith an apology for not 'delivering,' as is usual in such cases, a\r\ndidactic poem: a didactic poem, in our opinion, being precisely no poem\r\nat all. After some farther words--still of apology--for the\r\n'indefiniteness' and 'general imbecility' of what we had to offer--all\r\nso unworthy a _Bostonian_ audience--we commenced, and with many\r\ninterruptions of applause, concluded. Upon the whole, the approbation was\r\nconsiderably more (the more the pity too) than that bestowed upon Mr.\r\nCushing. When we had made an end the audience of course arose to depart;\r\nand about one-tenth of them, probably, had really departed, when Mr.\r\nCoffin, one of the managing committee, arrested those who remained, by\r\nthe announcement that we had been requested to deliver 'The Raven.' We\r\ndelivered 'The Raven' forthwith--(without taking a receipt)--were very\r\ncordially applauded again--and this was the end of it--with the exception\r\nof the sad tale invented to suit her own purposes, by that amiable little\r\nenemy of ours, Miss Walter. We shall never call a woman 'a pretty little\r\nwitch' again as long as we live.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Hon. Caleb Cushing, then recently returned from his mission\r\nto China.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We like Boston. We were born there--and perhaps it is just as well not\r\nto mention that we are heartily ashamed of the fact. The Bostonians are\r\nvery well in their way. Their hotels are bad. Their pumpkin pies are\r\ndelicious. Their poetry is not so good. Their common is no common\r\nthing--and the duck-pond might answer-if its answer could be heard for\r\nthe frogs. But with all these good qualities, the Bostonians have no\r\nsoul. They have always evinced toward us, individually, the basest\r\ningratitude for the services we rendered them in enlightening them about\r\nthe originality of Mr. Longfellow. When we accepted, therefore, an\r\ninvitation to 'deliver' a poem in Boston, we accepted it simply and\r\nsolely, because we had a curiosity to know how it felt to be publicly\r\nhissed--and because we wished to see what effect we could produce by a\r\nneat little _impromptu_ speech in reply. Perhaps, however, we overrated\r\nour own importance, or the Bostonian want of common civility--which is\r\nnot quite so manifest as one or two of their editors would wish the\r\npublic to believe. We assure Major Noah that he is wrong. The Bostonians\r\nare well-bred--as _very_ dull persons very generally are. Still, with\r\ntheir vile ingratitude staring us in the eyes, it could scarcely be\r\nsupposed that we would put ourselves to the trouble of composing for the\r\nBostonians anything in the shape of an _original_ poem. We did not. We\r\nhad a poem, of about 500 lines, lying by us--one quite as good as\r\nnew--one, at all events, that we considered would answer sufficiently\r\nwell for an audience of Transcendentalists. _That_ we gave them--it was\r\nthe best that we had--for the price--and it _did_ answer remarkably\r\nwell. Its name was _not_ 'The Messenger-Star'--who but Miss Walter would\r\never think of so delicious a little bit of invention as that? We had no\r\nname for it at all. The poem is what is occasionally called a 'juvenile\r\npoem,' but the fact is it is anything but juvenile now, for we wrote it,\r\nprinted it, and published it, in book form, before we had completed our\r\ntenth year. We read it _verbatim_, from a copy now in our possession, and\r\nwhich we shall be happy to show at any moment to any of our inquisitive\r\nfriends. We do not, ourselves, think the poem a remarkably good one: it\r\nis not sufficiently transcendental. Still it did well enough for the\r\nBoston audience--who evinced characteristic discrimination in\r\nunderstanding, and especially applauding all those knotty passages which\r\nwe ourselves have not yet been able to understand.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the auger of _The Boston Times_, and one or two other\r\nabsurdities--as regards, we say the wrath of Achilles--we incurred it-or\r\nrather its manifestation--by letting some of our cat out of the bag a few\r\nhours sooner than we had intended. Over a bottle of champagne, that\r\nnight, we confessed to Messrs. Cushing, Whipple, Hudson, Fields, and a\r\nfew other natives who swear not altogether by the frog-pond-we\r\nconfessed, we say, the soft impeachment of the hoax. _Et hine ille iræ_.\r\nWe should have waited a couple of days.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to suggest that this must have been written\r\nbefore he had quite recovered from the long intoxication which maddened\r\nhim at the time to which it refers--that he was not born in Boston-that\r\nthe poem was not published in his tenth year, and that the \"hoax\" was all\r\nan after-thought. Two weeks later he renewed the discussion of the\r\nsubject in _The Broadway Journal_, commenting as follows upon allusions\r\nto it by other parties:\r\n\r\n\"Were the question demanded of us--'What is the most exquisite of\r\nsublunary pleasures?' we should reply, without hesitation, the making a\r\nfuss, or in the classical words of a western friend, the 'kicking up a\r\nbobbery.' Never was a 'bobbery' more delightful than that which we have\r\njust succeeded in 'kicking up' all around about Boston Common. We never\r\nsaw the Frogpondians so lively in our lives. They seem absolutely to be\r\nupon the point of waking up. In about nine days the puppies may get open\r\ntheir eyes. That is to say, they may get open their eyes to certain facts\r\nwhich have long been obvious to all the world except themselves-the\r\nfacts that there exist other cities than Boston--other men of letters\r\nthan Professor Longfellow--other vehicles of literary information than\r\nthe _Down-East Review_.'\r\n\r\n\"We had _tact_ enough not to be 'taken in and done for' by the\r\nBostonians. _Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes_--(for _timeo_ substitute\r\n_contemno_ or _turn-up-your-nose-o_.) We knew very well that among a\r\ncertain _clique_ of the Frogpondians, there existed a predetermination to\r\nabuse us under _any_ circumstances. We knew, that write what we would,\r\nthey would swear it to be worthless. We knew, that were we to compose for\r\nthem a 'Paradise Lost,' they would pronounce it an indifferent poem. It\r\nwould have been very weak in us, then, to put ourselves to the trouble of\r\nattempting to please these people. We preferred pleasing ourselves. We\r\nread before them a 'juvenile'--a _very_ 'juvenile' poem--and thus the\r\nFrogpondians were _had_--were delivered up to the enemy bound hand and\r\nfoot. Never were a set of people more completely demolished. They have\r\nblustered and flustered--but what have they done or said that has not\r\nmade them more thoroughly ridiculous? What, in the name of Momus, is it\r\n_possible_ for them to do or say? We 'delivered' them the 'juvenile\r\npoem,' and they received it with applause. This is accounted for by the\r\nfact, that the _clique_ (contemptible in numbers as in everything else)\r\nwere overruled by the rest of the assembly. These malignants did not\r\n_dare_ to interrupt by their preconcerted hisses, the respectful and\r\nprofound attention of the majority. We have been told, indeed, that as\r\nmany as three or four of the personal friends of the little old lady\r\nentitled Miss Walter, did actually leave the hall during the\r\nrecitation--but, upon the whole, this was the very best thing they could\r\ndo. We have been told this, we say--we did not _see_ them take their\r\ndeparture:--the fact is, they belong to a class of people that we make it\r\na point _never to see_. The poem being thus well received, in spite of\r\nthis ridiculous little cabal--the next thing to be done was to abuse it\r\nin the papers. Here, they imagined, they were sure of their game. But\r\nwhat have they accomplished? The poem, they say, is bad. We admit it. We\r\ninsisted upon this fact in our prefatory remarks, and we insist upon it\r\nnow, over and over again. It _is_ bad--it is wretched--and what then? We\r\nwrote it at ten years of age--had it been worth even a pumpkin-pie,\r\nundoubtedly we should not have 'delivered' it to _them_. To demonstrate\r\nits utter worthlessness, _The Boston Star_ has copied the poem in full,\r\nwith two or three columns of criticism (we suppose), by way of explaining\r\nthat we should have been hanged for its perpetration. There is no doubt\r\nof it whatever--we should. The _Star_, however, (a dull luminary,) has\r\ndone us more honor than it intended; it has copied our _third_ edition of\r\nthe poem, revised and improved. We considered this too good for the\r\noccasion by one-half, and so 'delivered' our _first_ edition with all its\r\nimperfections on its head. It is the first--the original edition--the\r\n_delivered_ edition--which we now republish in our collection of Poems.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he accepted the invitation of the Lyceum he intended to write an\r\noriginal poem, upon a subject which he said had haunted his imagination\r\nfor years; but cares, anxieties, and feebleness of will, prevented; and a\r\nweek before the appointed night he wrote to a friend imploring\r\nassistance. \"You compose with such astonishing facility,\" he urged in his\r\nletter, \"that you can easily furnish me, quite soon enough, a poem that\r\nshall be equal to my reputation. For the love of God I beseech you to\r\nhelp me in this extremity.\" The lady wrote him kindly, advising him\r\njudiciously, but promising to attempt the fulfillment of his wishes\r\nShe was, however, an invalid, and so failed.[C] At last, instead of\r\npleading illness himself, as he had previously done on a similar\r\noccasion, he determined to read his poem of \"Al Aaraaf,\" the original\r\npublication of which, in 1829, has already been stated.\r\n\r\nThe last number of the _Broadway Journal_ was published on the third of\r\nJanuary,1846, and Poe soon after commenced the series of papers entitled\r\n\"The Literati of New-York City,\" which was published in _The Lady's Book_\r\nin six numbers, from May to October. Their spirit, boldness, and\r\noccasional causticity caused them to be much talked about, and three\r\neditions were necessary to supply the demand for some numbers of the\r\nmagazine containing them. They however led to a disgraceful quarrel, and\r\nthis to a premature conclusion. Dr. Thomas Dunn English, who had at one\r\ntime sustained the most intimate relations with Poe, chose to evince his\r\nresentment of the critic's unfairness by the publication of a card in\r\nwhich he painted strongly the infirmities of Poe's life and character,\r\nand alleged that he had on several occasions inflicted upon him personal\r\nchastisement. This was not a wise confession, for a gentleman never\r\nappeals to his physical abilities except for defense. But the entire\r\npublication, even if every word of it were true, was unworthy of Dr.\r\nEnglish, unnecessary, and not called for by Poe's article, though that,\r\nas every one acquainted with the parties might have seen, was entirely\r\nfalse in what purported to be its facts. The statement of Dr. English\r\nappeared in the New York _Mirror_ of the twenty-third of June, and on the\r\ntwenty-seventh Mr. Poe sent to Mr. Godey for publication in the _Lady's\r\nBook_ his rejoinder, which would have made about five of the large pages\r\nof that miscellany. Mr. Godey very properly declined to print it, and\r\nobserved, in the communication of his decision, that the tone of the\r\narticle was regarded as unsuitable for his work and as altogether wrong.\r\nIn compliance with the author's wishes, however, he had caused its\r\nappearance in a daily paper. Poe then wrote to him:\r\n\r\n\"The man or men who told you that there was anything wrong in _the tone_\r\nof my reply, were either my enemies, or your enemies, or asses. When you\r\nsee them, tell them so, from me. I have never written an article upon\r\nwhich I more confidently depend for _literary_ reputation than that\r\nReply. Its merit lay in its being precisely adapted to its purpose. In\r\nthis city I have had upon it the favorable judgments of the best men. All\r\nthe error about it was yours. You should have done as I\r\nrequested--published it in the _Book_. It is of no use to conceive a plan\r\nif you have to depend upon another for its execution.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I agree with Mr. Godey. Poe's article was as bad as that of\r\nEnglish. Yet a part of one of its paragraphs is interesting, and it is\r\nhere transcribed:\r\n\r\n--\"Let me not permit any profundity of disgust to induce, even for an\r\ninstant, a violation of the dignity of truth. What is _not false_, amid\r\nthe scurrility of this man's statements, it is not in my nature to brand\r\nas false, although oozing from the filthy lips of which a lie is the\r\nonly natural language. The errors and frailties which I deplore, it\r\ncannot at least be asserted that I have been the coward to deny. Never,\r\neven, have I made attempt at _extenuating_ a weakness which is (or, by\r\nthe blessing of God, was) a calamity, although those who did not know me\r\nintimately had little reason to regard it otherwise than a crime. For,\r\nindeed, had my pride, or that of my family permitted, there was\r\nmuch--very much--there was everything to be offered in extenuation.\r\nPerhaps, even, there was an epoch at which it might not have been wrong\r\nin me to hint--what by the testimony of Dr. Francis and other medical\r\nmen I might have demonstrated, had the public, indeed, cared for the\r\ndemonstration--that the irregularities so profoundly lamented were the\r\n_effect_ of a terrible evil rather than its cause.--And now let me thank\r\nGod that in redemption from the physical ill I have forever got rid of\r\nthe moral.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Francis never gave any such testimony. On one occasion Poe borrowed\r\nfifty dollars from a distinguished literary woman of South Carolina,\r\npromising to return it in a few days, and when he failed to do so, and\r\nwas asked for a written acknowledgment of the debt that might be\r\nexhibited to the husband of the friend who had thus served him, he denied\r\nall knowledge of it, and threatened to exhibit a correspondence which he\r\nsaid would make the woman infamous, if she said any more on the subject.\r\nOf course there had never been any such correspondence, but when Poe\r\nheard that a brother of the slandered party was in quest of him for the\r\npurpose of taking the satisfaction supposed to be due in such cases, he\r\nsent for Dr. Francis and induced him to carry to the gentleman his\r\nretraction and apology, with a statement which seemed true enough for the\r\nmoment, that Poe was \"out of his head.\" It is an ungracious duty to\r\ndescribe such conduct in a person of Poe's unquestionable genius and\r\ncapacities of greatness, but those who are familiar with the career of\r\nthis extraordinary creature can recall but too many similar anecdotes;\r\nand as to his intemperance, they perfectly well understand that its\r\npathology was like that of ninety-nine of every hundred cases of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: This lady was the late Mrs. Osgood, and a fragment of what\r\nshe wrote under these circumstances may be found in the last edition of\r\nher works under the title of \"Lullin, or the Diamond Fay.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the autumn of 1846 wore on, Poe's habits of frequent intoxication and\r\nhis inattention to the means of support reduced him to much more than\r\ncommon destitution. He was now living at Fordham, several miles from the\r\ncity, so that his necessities were not generally known even among his\r\nacquaintances; but when the dangerous illness of his wife was added to\r\nhis misfortunes, and his dissipation and accumulated causes of anxiety\r\nhad prostrated all his own energies, the subject was introduced into the\r\njournals. The _Express_ said:\r\n\r\n\"We regret to learn that Edgar A. Poe and his wife are both dangerously\r\nill with the consumption, and that the hand of misfortune lies heavy\r\nupon their temporal affairs. We are sorry to mention the fact that they\r\nare so far reduced as to be barely able to obtain the necessaries of\r\nlife. This is indeed a hard lot, and we hope that the friends and\r\nadmirers of Mr. Poe will come promptly to his assistance in his bitterest\r\nhour of need.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willis, in an article in the _Home Journal_ suggesting a hospital for\r\ndisabled laborers with the brain, said--\r\n\r\n\"The feeling we have long entertained on this subject, has been freshened\r\nby a recent paragraph in the _Express_, announcing that Mr. Edgar A. Poe\r\nand his wife were both dangerously ill, and suffering for want of the\r\ncommon necessaries of life. Here is one of the finest scholars, one of\r\nthe most original men of genius, and one of the most industrious of the\r\nliterary profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,\r\nfrom bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the common\r\nobjects of public charity. There was no intermediate stopping-place-no\r\nrespectful shelter where, with the delicacy due to genius and culture, he\r\nmight secure aid, unadvertised, till, with returning health, he could\r\nresume his labors and his unmortified sense of independence. He must\r\neither apply to individual friends--(a resource to which death is\r\nsometimes almost preferable)--or _suffer down_ to the level where Charity\r\nreceives claimants, but where Rags and Humiliation are the only\r\nrecognized Ushers to her presence. Is this right? Should there not be, in\r\nall highly civilized communities, an Institution designed expressly for\r\neducated and refined objects of charity--a hospital, a retreat, a home of\r\nseclusion and comfort, the sufficient claims to which would be such\r\nsusceptibilities as are violated by the above mentioned appeal in a daily\r\nnewspaper.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire article from which this paragraph is taken, was an ingenious\r\napology for Mr. Poe's infirmities; but it was conceived and executed in a\r\ngenerous spirit, and it had a quick effect in various contributions,\r\nwhich relieved the poet from pecuniary embarrassments. The next week he\r\npublished the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"_My Dear Willis_:--The paragraph which has been put in circulation\r\nrespecting my wife's illness, my own, my poverty, etc., is now lying\r\nbefore me; together with the beautiful lines by Mrs. Locke and those by\r\nMrs. ----, to which the paragraph has given rise, as well as your kind\r\nand manly comments in _The Home Journal_. The motive of the paragraph I\r\nleave to the conscience of him or her who wrote it or suggested it. Since\r\nthe thing is done, however, and since the concerns of my family are thus\r\npitilessly thrust before the public, I perceive no mode of escape from a\r\npublic statement of what is true and what erroneous in the report alluded\r\nto. That my wife is ill, then, is true; and you may imagine with what\r\nfeelings I add that this illness, hopeless from the first, has been\r\nheightened and precipitated by her reception at two different periods, of\r\nanonymous letters,--one inclosing the paragraph now in question; the\r\nother, those published calumnies of Messrs. ----, for which I yet hope to\r\nfind redress in a court of justice.\r\n\r\n\"Of the facts, that I myself have been long and dangerously ill, and that\r\nmy illness has been a well-understood thing among my brethren of the\r\npress, the best evidence is afforded by the innumerable paragraphs of\r\npersonal and literary abuse with which I have been latterly assailed.\r\nThis matter, however, will remedy itself. At the very first blush of my\r\nnew prosperity, the gentlemen who toadied me in the old, will recollect\r\nthemselves and toady me again. You, who know me, will comprehend that I\r\nspeak of these things only as having served, in a measure, to lighten the\r\ngloom of unhappiness, by a gentle and not unpleasant sentiment of mingled\r\npity, merriment and contempt. That, as the inevitable consequence of so\r\nlong an illness, I have been in want of money, it would be folly in me to\r\ndeny--but that I have ever materially suffered from privation, beyond the\r\nextent of my capacity for suffering, is not altogether true. That I am\r\n'without friends' is a gross calumny, which I am sure _you_ never could\r\nhave believed, and which a thousand noble-hearted men would have good\r\nright never to forgive me for permitting to pass unnoticed and undenied.\r\nEven in the city of New York I could have no difficulty in naming a\r\nhundred persons, to each of whom--when the hour for speaking had\r\narrived--I could and would have applied for aid with unbounded\r\nconfidence, and with absolutely _no_ sense of humiliation. I do not\r\nthink, my dear Willis, that there is any need of my saying more. I am\r\ngetting better, and may add--if it be any comfort to my enemies--that I\r\nhave little fear of getting worse. The truth is, I have a great deal to\r\ndo; and I have made up my mind not to die till it is done. Sincerely\r\nyours,\r\n\r\n\"December 30th, 1846. EDGAR A. POE.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written for effect. He had not been ill a great while, nor\r\ndangerously at all; there was no literary or personal abuse of him in the\r\njournals; and his friends in town had been applied to for money until\r\ntheir patience was nearly exhausted. His wife, however, was very sick,\r\nand in a few weeks she died. In a letter to a lady in Massachusetts, who,\r\nupon the appearance of the newspaper articles above quoted, had sent him\r\nmoney and expressions of sympathy, he wrote, under date of March 10,\r\n1847:\r\n\r\n\"In answering your kind letter permit me in the first place to absolve\r\nmyself from a suspicion which, under the circumstances, you could\r\nscarcely have failed to entertain--a suspicion of discourtesy toward\r\nyourself, in not having more promptly replied to you.... I could not help\r\nfeeling that should you see my letter to Mr. Willis--in which a natural\r\npride, which I feel you could not blame, impelled me to shrink from\r\npublic charity, even _at the cost of truth, in denying those necessities\r\nwhich were but too real_--I could not help fearing that, should you see\r\nthis letter, you would yourself feel pained at having caused me pain-at\r\nhaving been the means of giving further publicity to an unfounded\r\nreport--at all events to the report of a wretchedness which I had thought\r\nit prudent (since the world regards wretchedness as a crime) so publicly\r\nto disavow. In a word, venturing to judge your noble nature by my own, I\r\nfelt grieved lest my published denial might cause you to regret what you\r\nhad done; and my first impulse was to write you, and assure you, even at\r\nthe risk of doing so too warmly, of the sweet emotion, made up of respect\r\nand gratitude alone, with which my heart was filled to overflowing. While\r\nI was hesitating, however, in regard to the propriety of this step, I was\r\noverwhelmed by a sorrow so poignant as to deprive me for several weeks of\r\nall power of thought or action. Your letter, now lying before me, tells\r\nme that I had not been mistaken in your nature, and that I should not\r\nhave hesitated to address you; but believe me, my dear Mrs. L----, that I\r\nam already ceasing to regard those difficulties or misfortunes which have\r\nled me to even this partial correspondence with yourself.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year Mr. Poe was not often before the public, but he was as\r\nindustrious, perhaps, as he had been at any time, and early in 1848\r\nadvertisement was made of his intention to deliver several lectures, with\r\na view to obtain an amount of money sufficient to establish his\r\nso-long-contemplated monthly magazine. His first lecture--and only one at\r\nthis period--was given at the Society Library, in New York, on the ninth\r\nof February, and was upon the cosmogony of the Universe: it was attended\r\nby an eminently intellectual auditory, and the reading of it occupied\r\nabout two hours and a half; it was what he afterward published under the\r\ntitle of \"Eureka, a Prose Poem.\"\r\n\r\nTo the composition of this work he brought his subtlest and highest\r\ncapacities, in their most perfect development. Denying that the arcana of\r\nthe universe can be explored by induction, but informing his imagination\r\nwith the various results of science, he entered with unhesitating\r\nboldness, though with no guide but the divinest instinct,--that sense of\r\nbeauty, in which our great Edwards recognizes the flowering of all\r\ntruth--into the sea of speculation, and there built up of according laws\r\nand their phenomena, as under the influence of a scientific inspiration,\r\nhis theory of Nature. I will not attempt the difficult task of condensing\r\nhis propositions; to be apprehended they must be studied in his own terse\r\nand simple language; but in this we have a summary of that which he\r\nregards as fundamental: \"The law which we call _Gravity_,\" he says,\r\n\"exists on account of matter having been radiated, at its origin,\r\natomically, into a _limited_ sphere of space, from one, individual,\r\nunconditional irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper,\r\nby the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same\r\ntime, the two conditions, radiation and equable distribution throughout\r\nthe sphere--that is to say, by a force varying in _direct_ proportion\r\nwith the squares of the distances between the radiated atoms,\r\nrespectively, and the particular center of radiation.\"\r\n\r\nPoe was thoroughly persuaded that he had discovered the great secret:\r\nthat the propositions of \"Eureka\" were true; and he was wont to talk of\r\nthe subject with a sublime and electrical enthusiasm which they cannot\r\nhave forgotten who were familiar with him at the period of its\r\npublication. He felt that an author known solely by his adventures in the\r\nlighter literature, throwing down the gauntlet to professors of science,\r\ncould not expect absolute fairness, and he had no hope but in discussions\r\nled by wisdom and candor. Meeting me, he said, \"Have you read 'Eureka?'\"\r\nI answered, \"Not yet: I have just glanced at the notice of it by Willis,\r\nwho thinks it contains no more fact than fantasy, and I am sorry to\r\nsee--sorry if it be true--suggests that it corresponds in tone with that\r\ngathering of sham and obsolete hypotheses addressed to fanciful tyros,\r\nthe 'Vestiges of Creation;' and our good and really wise friend Bush,\r\nwhom you will admit to be of all the professors, in temper one of the\r\nmost habitually just, thinks that while you may have guessed very\r\nshrewdly, it would not be difficult to suggest many difficulties in the\r\nway of your doctrine.\" \"It is by no means ingenuous,\" he replied, \"to\r\nhint that there are such difficulties, and yet to leave them unsuggested.\r\nI challenge the investigation of every point in the book. I deny that\r\nthere are any difficulties which I have not met and overthrown. Injustice\r\nis done me by the application of this word 'guess:' I have assumed\r\n_nothing_ and proved _all_.\" In his preface he wrote: \"To the few who\r\nlove me and whom I love; to those who feel rather than to those who\r\nthink; to the dreamers and those who put faith in dreams as in the only\r\nrealities--I offer this book of truths, not in the character of\r\nTruth-Teller, but for the beauty that abounds in its truth: constituting\r\nit true. To these I present the composition as an Art-Product\r\nalone:---let us say as a Romance; or, if it be not urging too lofty a\r\nclaim, as a Poem. What I here propound is true: therefore it cannot die:\r\nor it by any means it be now trodden down so that it die, it will rise\r\nagain to the life everlasting.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I read \"Eureka\" I could not help but think it immeasurably superior\r\nas an illustration of genius to the \"Vestiges of Creation;\" and as I\r\nadmired the poem, (except the miserable attempt at humor in what purports\r\nto be a letter found in a bottle floating on the _Mare tenebrarum_,) so I\r\nregretted its pantheism, which is not necessary to its main design. To\r\nsome of the objections to his work be made this answer in a letter to Mr.\r\nC.F. Hoffman, then editor of the _Literary World_:\r\n\r\n\"_Dear Sir_:--In your paper of July 29, I find some comments on 'Eureka,'\r\na late book of my own; and I know you too well to suppose for a moment,\r\nthat you will refuse me the privilege of a few words in reply. I feel,\r\neven, that I might safely claim, from Mr. Hoffman, the right, which every\r\nauthor has, of replying to his critic _tone for tone_--that is to say, of\r\nanswering your correspondent, flippancy by flippancy and sneer by\r\nsneer--but in the first place, I do not wish to disgrace the _World_;\r\nand, in the second, I feel that I never should be done sneering, in the\r\npresent instance, were I once to begin. Lamartine blames Voltaire for the\r\nuse which he made of (_ruse_) misrepresentation, in his attacks on the\r\npriesthood; but our young students of Theology do not seem to be aware\r\nthat in defense or what they fancy to be defense, of Christianity, there\r\nis anything wrong in such gentlemanly peccadillos as the deliberate\r\nperversion of an author's text--to say nothing of the minor _indecora_ of\r\nreviewing a book without reading it and without having the faintest\r\nsuspicion of what it is about.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand that it is merely the _misrepresentations_ of the\r\n_critique_ in question to which I claim the privilege of reply:--the mere\r\n_opinions_ of the writer can be of no consequence to me--and I should\r\nimagine of very little to himself--that is to say if he knows himself,\r\npersonally, as well as _I_ have the honor of knowing him. The first\r\nmisrepresentation is contained in this sentence:--'This letter is a keen\r\nburlesque on the Aristotelian or Baconian methods of ascertaining Truth,\r\nboth of which the writer ridicules and despises, and pours forth his\r\nrhapsodical ecstasies in a glorification of the third mode--the noble art\r\nof _guessing_.' What I _really_ say is this:--That there is no absolute\r\n_certainty_ either in the Aristotelian or Baconian process--that, for\r\nthis reason, neither Philosophy is so profound as it fancies itself--and\r\nthat neither has a right to sneer at that _seemingly_ imaginative process\r\ncalled Intuition (by which the great Kepler attained his laws); since\r\n'Intuition,' after all, 'is but the conviction arising from those\r\n_in_ductions or _de_ductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to\r\nescape our consciousness, elude our reason or defy our capacity of\r\nexpression.' The second misrepresentation runs thus:--'The developments\r\nof electricity and the formation of stars and suns, luminous and\r\nnonluminous, moons and planets, with their rings, &c., is deduced, very\r\nmuch according to the nebular theory of Laplace, from the principle\r\npropounded above.' Now the impression intended to be made here upon the\r\nreader's mind, by the 'Student of Theology,' is evidently, that my theory\r\nmay all be very well in its way, but that it is nothing but Laplace over\r\nagain, with some modifications that he (the Student of Theology) cannot\r\nregard as at all important. I have only to say that no gentleman can\r\naccuse me of the disengenuousness here implied; inasmuch as, having\r\nproceeded with my theory up to that point at which Laplace's theory\r\n_meets_ it, I then _give Laplace's theory in full_, with the expression\r\nof my firm conviction of its absolute truth _at all points_. The _ground_\r\ncovered by the great French astronomer compares with that covered by my\r\ntheory, as a bubble compares with the ocean on which it floats; nor has\r\nhe the slightest allusion to the 'principle propounded above,' the\r\nprinciple of Unity being the source of all things--the principle of\r\nGravity being merely the Reaction of the Divine Act which irradiated all\r\nthings from Unity. In fact _no_ point of _my_ theory has been even\r\nso much as alluded to by Laplace. I have not considered it necessary,\r\nhere to speak of the astronomical knowledge displayed in the 'stars _and_\r\nsuns' of the Student of Theology, nor to hint that it would be better to\r\nsay that 'development and formation _are_, than that development and\r\nformation _is_. The third misrepresentation lies in a foot-note, where\r\nthe critic says:--'Further than this, Mr. Poe's claim that he can account\r\nfor the existence of all organized beings--man included--merely from\r\nthose principles on which the origin and present appearance of suns and\r\nworlds are explained, must be set down as mere bald assertion, without a\r\nparticle of evidence. In other words we should term it _arrant fudge_.'\r\nThe perversion at this point is involved in a willful misapplication of\r\nthe word 'principles.' I say 'wilful' because, at page 63, I am\r\n_particularly_ careful to distinguish between the principles proper,\r\nAttraction and Repulsion, and those merely resultant _sub_-principles\r\nwhich control the universe in detail. To these sub-principles, swayed by\r\nthe immediate spiritual influence of Deity. I leave, without examination,\r\n_all that_ which the Student of Theology so roundly asserts I account for\r\non the _principles_ which account for the constitution of suns, &c.\r\n\r\n\"In the third column of his 'review' the critic says:--'He asserts that\r\neach soul is its own God--its own Creator.' What I _do_ assert is, that\r\n'each soul is, _in part_, its own God--its own Creator.' Just below, the\r\ncritic says:--'After all these contradictory propoundings concerning God\r\nwe would remind him of what he lays down on page 23--'of this Godhead in\r\nitself he alone is not imbecile--he alone is not impious who propounds\r\n_nothing_. A man who thus conclusively convicts himself of imbecility and\r\nimpiety needs no further refutation.' Now the sentence, _as I wrote it_,\r\nand as _I find it_ printed on that very page which the critic refers to\r\nand which _must have been lying before him_ while he quoted my words,\r\nruns thus:--'Of this Godhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile, &c.,\r\nwho propounds nothing.' By the italics, as the critic well knew, I design\r\nto distinguish between the two possibilities--that of a knowledge of God\r\nthrough his works and that of a knowledge of Him in his _essential\r\nnature_. The Godhead, _in itself_, is distinguished from the Godhead\r\nobserved _in its effects_. But our critic is zealous. Moreover, being a\r\ndivine, he is honest--ingenuous. It is his _duty_ to pervert my meaning\r\nby omitting my italics--just as, in the sentence previously quoted, it\r\nwas his Christian duty to falsify my argument by leaving out the two\r\nwords, 'in part,' upon which turns the whole force--indeed the whole\r\nintelligibility of my proposition.\r\n\r\n\"Were these 'misrepresentations' (_is_ that the name for them?) made for\r\nany less serious a purpose than that of branding my book as 'impious'\r\nand myself as a 'pantheist,' a 'polytheist,' a Pagan, or a God knows what\r\n(and indeed I care very little so it be not a 'Student of Theology'),\r\nI would have permitted their dishonesty to pass unnoticed, through pure\r\ncontempt of the boyishness--for the _turn-down-shirt-collar-ness_ of\r\ntheir tone:--but, as it is, you will pardon me, Mr. Editor, that I have\r\nbeen compelled to expose a 'critic' who courageously preserving his own\r\n_anonymosity_, takes advantage of my absence from the city to\r\nmisrepresent, and thus vilify me, _by name_.    EDGAR A. POE.\r\n\r\n\"Fordham, September 20, 1848.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time Poe did not write much; he had quarreled with the\r\nconductors of the chief magazines for which he had previously written,\r\nand they no longer sought his assistance. In a letter to a friend, he\r\nlaments the improbabilities of an income from literary labor, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I have represented ---- to you as merely an ambitious simpleton, anxious\r\nto get into society with the reputation of conducting a magazine which\r\nsomebody behind the curtain always prevents him from quite damning with\r\nhis stupidity; he is a knave and a beast. I cannot write any more for the\r\nMilliner's Book, where T----n prints his feeble and _very_ quietly made\r\nDilutions of other people's reviews; and you know that ---- can afford to\r\npay but little, though I am glad to do anything for a good fellow like\r\n----. In this emergency I sell articles to the vulgar and trashy ----,\r\nfor $5 a piece. I inclose my last, cut out, lest you should see by my\r\nsending the paper in what company I am forced to appear.\"\r\n\r\nHis name was now frequently associated with that of one of the most\r\nbrilliant women of New England, and it was publicly announced that they\r\nwere to be married. He had first seen her on his way from Boston, when he\r\nvisited that city to deliver a poem before the Lyceum there. Restless,\r\nnear the midnight, he wandered from, his hotel near where she lived,\r\nuntil he saw her walking in a garden. He related the incident afterward\r\nin one of his most exquisite poems, worthy of himself, of her, and of the\r\nmost exalted passion.\r\n\r\n  \"I saw thee--once only--years ago;\r\n  I must not say _how_ many--but not many.\r\n  It was a July midnight; and from out\r\n  A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,\r\n  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\r\n  There fell a silvery-silken vail of light,\r\n  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,\r\n  Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand\r\n  Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,\r\n  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--\r\n  Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses\r\n  That gave out, in return for the love-light,\r\n  Their odorous souls in an estatic death--\r\n  Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses\r\n  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\r\n  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\r\n\r\n  \"Clad all in white, upon a violet bank\r\n  I saw thee half reclining; while the moon\r\n  Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses,\r\n  And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!\r\n\r\n  \"Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\r\n  Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)\r\n  That bade me pause before the garden-gate,\r\n  To breathe the incense of those Slumbering roses?\r\n  No footstep stirred; the hated world all slept,\r\n  Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!--oh, God!\r\n  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)\r\n  Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--\r\n  And in an instant all things disappeared.\r\n  (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)\r\n  The pearly luster of the moon went out:\r\n  The mossy banks and the meandering paths,\r\n  The happy flowers and the repining trees,\r\n  Were seen no more: the very roses' odors\r\n  Died in the arms of the adoring airs,\r\n  All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:\r\n  Save only the divine light in thine eyes--\r\n  Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.\r\n  I saw but them--they were the world to me.\r\n  I saw but them--saw only them for hours--\r\n  Saw only them until the moon went down.\r\n  What wild heart histories seemed to lie enwritten\r\n  Upon those crystalline celestial spheres!\r\n  How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!\r\n  How silently serene a sea of pride!\r\n  How daring an ambition! Yet how deep--\r\n  How fathomless a capacity for love!\r\n\r\n  \"But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight\r\n  Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;\r\n  And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees\r\n  Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained_.\r\n  They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.\r\n  Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,\r\n  _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.\r\n  They follow me--they lead me through the years\r\n  They are my ministers--yet I their slave.\r\n  Their office is to illumine and enkindle--\r\n  My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,\r\n  And purified in their electric fire,\r\n  And sanctified in their elysian fire.\r\n  They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope,)\r\n  And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to\r\n  In the sad, silent watches of my night;\r\n  While even in the meridian glare of day\r\n  I see them still--two sweetly scintillant\r\n  Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!\"\r\n\r\nThey were not married, and the breaking of the engagement affords a\r\nstriking illustration of his character. He said to an acquaintance\r\nin New York, who congratulated with him upon the prospect of his union\r\nwith a person of so much genius and so many virtues--\"It is a mistake: I\r\nam not going to be married.\" \"Why, Mr. Poe, I understand that the bans\r\nhave been published.\" \"I cannot help what you have heard, my dear Madam:\r\nbut mark me, I shall not marry her.\" He left town the same evening, and\r\nthe next day was reeling through the streets of the city which was the\r\nlady's home, and in the evening--that should have been the evening before\r\nthe bridal--in his drunkenness he committed at her house such outrages as\r\nmade necessary a summons of the police. Here was no insanity leading to\r\nindulgence: he went from New York with a determination thus to induce an\r\nending of the engagement; and he succeeded.\r\n\r\nSometime in August, 1849, Mr. Poe left New York for Virginia. In\r\nPhiladelphia he encountered persons who had been his associates in\r\ndissipations while he lived there, and for several days he abandoned\r\nhimself entirely to the control of his worst appetites. When his money\r\nwas all spent, and the disorder of his dress evinced the extremity of his\r\nrecent intoxication, he asked in charity means for the prosecution of his\r\njourney to Richmond. There, after a few days, he joined a temperance\r\nsociety, and his conduct showed the earnestness of his determination to\r\nreform his life. He delivered in some of the principal towns of Virginia\r\ntwo lectures, which were well attended, and renewing his acquaintance\r\nwith a lady whom he had known in his youth, he was engaged to marry her,\r\nand wrote to his friends that he should pass the remainder of his days\r\namong the scenes endeared by all his pleasantest recollections of youth.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 4th of October, he set out for New York, to fulfill a\r\nliterary engagement, and to prepare for his marriage. Arriving in\r\nBaltimore he gave his trunk to a porter, with directions to convey it to\r\nthe cars which were to leave in an hour or two for Philadelphia, and went\r\ninto a tavern to obtain some refreshment. Here he met acquaintances who\r\ninvited him to drink; all his resolutions and duties were soon forgotten;\r\nin a few hours he was in such a state as is commonly induced only by\r\nlong-continued intoxication; after a night of insanity and exposure, he\r\nwas carried to a hospital; and there, on the evening of Sunday, the 7th\r\nof October, 1849, he died, at the age of thirty-eight years.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy history. No author of as much genius had ever in this\r\ncountry as much unhappiness; but Poe's unhappiness was in an unusual\r\ndegree the result of infirmities of nature, or of voluntary faults in\r\nconduct. A writer who evidently knew him well, and who comes before us in\r\nthe \"Southern Literary Messenger\" as his defender, is \"compelled to admit\r\nthat the blemishes in his life were effects of character rather than of\r\ncircumstances.\"[A] How this character might have been modified by a\r\njudicious education of all his faculties I leave for the decision of\r\nothers, but it will be evident to those who read this biography that the\r\nunchecked freedom of his earlier years was as unwise as its results were\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Southern Literary Messenger_, March, 1850, p. 179.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is contended that the higher intelligences, in the scrutiny to which\r\nthey appeal, are not to be judged by the common laws; but I apprehend\r\nthat this doctrine, as it is likely to be understood, is entirely wrong.\r\nAll men are amenable to the same principles, to the extent of the\r\nparallelism of these principles with their experience; and the line of\r\nduty becomes only more severe as it extends into the clearer atmosphere\r\nof truth and beauty which is the life of genius. _De mortuis nil nisi\r\nbonum_ is a common and an honorable sentiment, but its proper application\r\nwould lead to the suppression of the histories of half of the most\r\nconspicuous of mankind; in this case it is impossible on account of the\r\nnotoriety of Mr. Poe's faults; and it would be unjust to the living\r\nagainst whom his hands were always raided and who had no resort but in\r\nhis outlawry from their sympathies. Moreover, his career is full of\r\ninstruction and warning, and it has always been made a portion of the\r\npenalty of wrong that its anatomy should be displayed for the common\r\nstudy and advantage.\r\n\r\nThe character of Mr. Poe's genius has been so recently and so admirably\r\ndiscussed by Mr. Lowell, with whose opinions on the subject I for the most\r\npart agree, that I shall say but little of it here, having already\r\nextended this notice beyond the limits at first designed. There is a\r\nsingular harmony between his personal and his literary qualities. St.\r\nPierre, who seemed to be without any nobility in his own nature, in his\r\nwritings appeared to be moved only by the finest and highest impulses.\r\nPoe exhibits scarcely any virtue in either his life or his writings.\r\nProbably there is not another instance in the literature of our language\r\nin which so much has been accomplished without a recognition or a\r\nmanifestation of conscience. Seated behind the intelligence, and\r\ndirecting it, according to its capacities, Conscience is the parent of\r\nwhatever is absolutely and unquestionably beautiful in art as well as in\r\nconduct. It touches the creations of the mind and they have life; without\r\nit they have never, in the range of its just action, the truth and\r\nnaturalness which are approved by universal taste or in enduring\r\nreputation. In Poe's works there is constantly displayed the most\r\ntouching melancholy, the most extreme and terrible despair, but never\r\nreverence or remorse.\r\n\r\nHis genius was peculiar, and not, as he himself thought, various. He\r\nremarks in one of his letters:\r\n\r\n\"There is one particular in which I have had wrong done me, and it may\r\nnot be indecorous in me to call your attention to it. The last selection\r\nof my tales was made from about seventy by one of our great little\r\ncliquists and claquers, Wiley Putnam's reader, Duyckinck. He has what he\r\nthinks a taste for ratiocination, and has accordingly made up the book\r\nmostly of analytic stories. But this is not _representing_ my mind in its\r\nvarious phases--it is not giving me fair play. In writing these tales one\r\nby one, at long intervals. I have kept the book unity always in\r\nmind--that is, each has been composed with reference to its effect as\r\npart of a _whole_. In this view, one of my chief aims has been the widest\r\ndiversity of subject, thought, and especially _tone_ and manner of\r\nhandling. Were _all_ my tales now before me in a large volume, and as the\r\ncomposition of another, the merit which would principally arrest my\r\nattention would be their wide _diversity and variety_. You will be\r\nsurprised to hear me say that, (omitting one or two of my first efforts,)\r\nI do not consider any one of my stories _better_ than another. There is a\r\nvast variety of kinds, and, in degree of value, these kinds vary-but\r\neach tale is equally good of _its kind_. The loftiest kind is that of the\r\nhighest imagination--and for this reason only 'Ligeia' may be called my\r\nbest tale.\"\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that this selection of his tales was altogether\r\njudicious. Had it been submitted to me I might indeed have changed\r\nit in one or two instances, but I should not have replaced any tale by\r\none of a different tone. One of the qualities upon which Poe prides\r\nhimself was his humor, and he has left us a large number of compositions\r\nin this department, but except a few paragraphs in his \"Marginalia,\"\r\nscarcely anything which it would not have been injurious to his\r\nreputation to republish. His realm was on the shadowy confines of human\r\nexperience, among the abodes of crime, gloom, and horror, and there he\r\ndelighted to surround himself with images of beauty and of terror, to\r\nraise his solemn palaces and towers and spires in a night upon which\r\nshould rise no sun. His minuteness of detail, refinement of reasoning,\r\nand propriety and power of language--the perfect keeping (to borrow a\r\nphrase from another domain of art) and apparent good faith with which he\r\nmanaged the evocation and exhibition of his strange and spectral and\r\nrevolting creations--gave him an astonishing mastery over his readers, so\r\nthat his books were closed as one would lay aside the nightmare or the\r\nspells of opium. The analytical subtlety evinced in his works has\r\nfrequently been overestimated, as I have before observed, because it has\r\nnot been sufficiently considered that his mysteries were composed with\r\nthe express design of being dissolved. When Poe attempted the\r\nillustration of the profounder operations of the mind, as displayed in\r\nwritten reason or in real action, he frequently failed entirely.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, as in prose, he was eminently successful in the metaphysical\r\ntreatment of the passions. Hia poems are constructed with wonderful\r\ningenuity, and finished with consummate art. They display a somber and\r\nweird imagination, and a taste almost faultless in the apprehension of\r\nthat sort of beauty which was most agreeable to his temper. But they\r\nevince little genuine feeling, and less of that spontaneous ecstasy which\r\ngives its freedom, smoothness and naturalness to immortal verse. His own\r\naccount of the composition of \"The Raven,\" discloses his methods--the\r\nabsence of all impulse, and the absolute control of calculation and\r\nmechanism. That curious analysis of the processes by which he wrought\r\nwould be incredible if from another hand.\r\n\r\nHe was not remarkably original in invention. Indeed some of his\r\nplagiarisms are scarcely paralleled for their audacity in all literary\r\nhistory: For instance, in his tale of \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the\r\ncomplicate machinery upon which the interest depends is borrowed from a\r\nstory entitled \"Vivenzio, or Italian Vengeance,\" by the author of \"The\r\nFirst and Last Dinner,\" in \"Blackwood's Magazine.\" And I remember having\r\nbeen shown by Mr. Longfellow, several years ago, a series of papers which\r\nconstitute a demonstration that Mr. Poe was indebted to him for the idea\r\nof \"The Haunted Palace,\" one of the most admirable of his poems, which he\r\nso pertinaciously asserted had been used by Mr. Longfellow in the\r\nproduction of his \"Beleaguered City.\" Mr. Longfellow's poem was written\r\ntwo or three years before the first publication of that by Poe, and it\r\nwas during a portion of this time in Poe's possession; but it was not\r\nprinted, I believe, until a few weeks after the appearance of \"The\r\nHaunted Palace.\" \"It would be absurd,\" as Poe himself said many times,\r\n\"to believe the similarity of these pieces entirely accidental.\" This was\r\nthe first cause of all that malignant criticism which for so many years\r\nhe carried on against Mr. Longfellow. In his \"Marginalia\" he borrowed\r\nlargely, especially from Coleridge, and I have omitted in the\r\nrepublication of these papers, numerous paragraphs which were rather\r\ncompiled than borrowed from one of the profoundest and wisest of our own\r\nscholars.[D]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: I have neither space, time, nor inclination for a\r\ncontinuation of this subject, and I add but one other instance, in the\r\nwords of the Philadelphia \"Saturday Evening Post,\" published while Mr.\r\nPoe was living:\r\n\r\n\"One of the most remarkable plagiarisms was perpetrated by Mr. Poe, late\r\nof the Broadway Journal, whose harshness as a critic and assumption of\r\npeculiar originality make the fault in his case more glaring. This\r\ngentleman, a few years ago, in Philadelphia, published a work on\r\nConchology as original, when in reality it was a copy, near verbatim, of\r\n'The Text-book of Conchology, by Captain Thomas Brown,' printed in\r\nGlasgow in 1833, a duplicate of which we have in our library, Mr. Poe\r\nactually took out a copyright for the American edition of Captain Brown's\r\nwork, and, omitting all mention of the English original pretended, in the\r\npreface, to have been under great obligations to several scientific\r\ngentlemen of this city. It is but justice to add, that in the second\r\nedition of this book, published lately in Philadelphia, the name of Mr.\r\nPoe is withdrawn from the titlepage, and his initials only affixed to the\r\npreface. But the affair is one of the most curious on record.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn criticism, as Mr. Lowell justly remarks, Mr. Poe had \"a scientific\r\nprecision and coherence of logic;\" he had remarkable dexterity in the\r\ndissection of sentences; but he rarely ascended from the particular to\r\nthe general, from subjects to principles; he was familiar with the\r\nmicroscope but never looked through the telescope. His criticisms are of\r\nvalue to the degree in which they are demonstrative, but his unsupported\r\nassertions and opinions were so apt to be influenced by friendship or\r\nenmity, by the desire to please or the fear to offend, or by his constant\r\nambition to surprise, or produce a sensation, that they should be\r\nreceived in all cases with distrust of their fairness. A volume might be\r\nfilled with literary judgments by him as antagonistical and inconsistent\r\nas the sharpest antitheses. For example, when Mr. Laughton Osborn's\r\nromance, \"The Confessions of a Poet,\" came out, he reviewed it in \"The\r\nSouthern Literary Messenger,\" saying:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing of the _vates_ about the author. He is no poet-and\r\nmost positively he is no prophet. He avers upon his word of honor that\r\nin commencing this work he loads a pistol and places it upon the table.\r\nHe further states that, upon coming to a conclusion, it is his intention\r\nto blow out what he supposes to be his brains. Now this is excellent.\r\nBut, even with so rapid a writer as the poet must undoubtedly be, there\r\nwould be some little difficulty in completing the book under thirty days\r\nor thereabouts. The best of powder is apt to sustain injury by lying so\r\nlong 'in the load.' We sincerely hope the gentleman took the precaution\r\nto examine his priming before attempting the rash act. A flash in the\r\npan--and in such a case--were a thing to be lamented. Indeed there would\r\nbe no answering for the consequences. We might even have a second series\r\nof the 'Confessions.'\"--_Southern Literary Messenger_, i. 459.\r\n\r\nThis review was attacked, particularly in the Richmond \"Compiler,\" and\r\nMr. Poe felt himself called upon to vindicate it to the proprietor of the\r\nmagazine, to whom he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"There is no necessity of giving the 'Compiler' a reply. The book is\r\n_silly enough of itself_, without the aid of any controversy concerning\r\nit. I have read it, from beginning to end, and was very much amused at\r\nit. My opinion of it is pretty nearly the opinion of the press at large.\r\nI have heard no person offer one serious word in its defense.\"--_Letter\r\nto T.W. White_.\r\n\r\nAfterward Mr. Poe became personally acquainted with the author, and he\r\nthen wrote, in his account of \"The Literati of New-York City,\" as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The Confessions of a Poet made much noise in the literary world, and no\r\nlittle curiosity was excited in regard to its author, who was generally\r\nsupposed to be John Neal.... The 'Confessions,' however, far surpassed\r\nany production of Mr. Neal's.... _He_ has done nothing which, as a whole,\r\nis _even respectable_, and 'The Confessions' are quite remarkable for\r\ntheir artistic unity and perfection. But on higher regards they are to be\r\ncommended. _I do not think, indeed, that a better book of its kind has\r\nbeen written in America_....Its scenes of passion are intensely wrought,\r\nits incidents are striking and original, its sentiments audacious and\r\nsuggestive at least, if not at all times tenable. In a word, it is that\r\nrare thing, a fiction of _power_ without rudeness.\"\r\n\r\nI will adduce another example of the same kind. In a notice of the\r\n\"Democratic Review,\" for September, 1845, Mr. Poe remarks of Mr. William\r\nA. Jones's paper on American Humor:\r\n\r\n\"There is only one really bad article in the number, and that is\r\ninsufferable: nor do we think it the less a nuisance because it inflicts\r\nupon ourselves individually a passage of maudlin compliment about our\r\nbring a most 'ingenious critic' 'and prose poet,' with some other things\r\nof a similar kind. We thank for his good word no man who gives palpable\r\nevidence, in other cases than our own, of his _incapacity_ to distinguish\r\nthe false from the true--the right from the wrong. If we _are_ an\r\ningenious critic, or a prose poet, it is not because Mr. William Jones\r\nsays so. The truth is that this essay on 'American Humor' is\r\nContemptible both in a moral and literary sense--is the composition of an\r\n_imitator and a quack_--and disgraces the magazine in which it makes its\r\nappearance.\"--_Broadway Journal_, Vol. ii. No. 11.\r\n\r\nIn the following week he reconsidered this matter, opening his paper for\r\na defense of Mr. Jones; but at the close of it said--\r\n\r\n\"If we have done Mr. Jones injustice, we beg his pardon: but we do not\r\nthink we have.\"\r\n\r\nYet in a subsequent article in \"Graham's Magazine,\" on \"Critics and\r\nCriticism,\" he says of Mr. Jones, referring only to writings of his that\r\nhad been for years before the public when he printed the above\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"Our most analytic, _if not altogether our best critic_, (Mr. Whipple,\r\nperhaps, excepted,) is Mr. _William A. Jones_, author of 'The Analyst.'\r\nHow he would write elaborate criticisms I cannot say; but his summary\r\njudgments of authors are, in general, discriminative and profound. In\r\nfact, his papers on _Emerson_ and on _Macaulay_, published in 'Arcturus.'\r\nare better than merely 'profound,' if we take the word in its now\r\ndesecrated sense; for they are at once pointed, lucid, and just:--as\r\nsummaries leaving nothing to be desired.\"\r\n\r\nI will not continue the display of these inconsistencies. As I have\r\nAlready intimated, a volume might be filled with passages to show that\r\nhis criticisms were guided by no sense of duty, and that his opinions\r\nwere so variable and so liable to be influenced by unworthy\r\nconsiderations as to be really of no value whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was among his remarkable habits that he preserved with scrupulous care\r\neverything that was published respecting himself or his works, and\r\neverything that was written to him in letters that could be used in any\r\nway for the establishment or extension of his reputation. In\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1843, he prepared with his own hands a sketch of his\r\nlife for a paper called \"The Museum.\" Many parts of it are untrue, but I\r\nrefer to it for the purpose of quoting a characteristic instance of\r\nperversion in the reproduction of compliments:\r\n\r\n\"Of 'William Wilson,' Mr. Washington Irving says: 'It is managed in a\r\nhighly picturesque style, and its singular and mysterious interest is\r\nably sustained throughout. In point of mere style, it is, perhaps, even\r\nsuperior to 'The House of Usher.' It is simpler. In the latter\r\ncomposition, he seems to have been distrustful of his effects, or,\r\nrather, too solicitous of bringing them forth fully to the eye, and thus,\r\nperhaps, has laid on too much coloring. He has erred, however, on the\r\nsafe side, that of exuberance, and the evil might easily be remedied, by\r\nrelieving the style of some of its epithets;' [since done.] 'There would\r\nbe no fear of injuring the graphic effect, _which is powerful_.' The\r\nitalics are Mr. Irving's own.\"\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Irving had said in a private letter that he thought the \"House of\r\nUsher\" Was clever, and that \"a volume of similar stories would be well\r\nreceived by the public.\" Poe sent him a magazine containing \"William\r\nWilson,\" asking his opinion of it, and Mr. Irving, expressly declining to\r\n_publish_ a word upon the subject, remarked in the same manner, that \"the\r\nsingular and mysterious interest is well sustained,\" and that in point of\r\nstyle the tale was \"much better\" than the \"House of Usher,\" which, he\r\nsays, \"might be improved by relieving the style from some of the\r\nepithets: there is no danger of destroying the graphic effect, which\r\nis powerful.\" There is not a word in _italics_ in Mr. Irving's letter,\r\nthe meaning of which is quite changed by Mr. Poe's alterations. And this\r\nletter was not only published in the face of an implied prohibition, but\r\nmade to seem like a deliberately-expressed judgment in a public reviewal.\r\nIn the same way Mr. Poe published the following sentence as an extract\r\nfrom a letter by Miss Barrett:\r\n\r\n\"Our great poet, Mr. Browning, the author of 'Paracelsus,' etc., _is\r\nenthusiastic in his admiration_ of the rhythm.\"\r\n\r\nBut on turning to Miss Barrett's letter, I find that she wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Our great poet, Mr. Browning, author of 'Paracelsus,' and 'Bells and\r\nPomegranates,' was struck much by the rhythm of that poem.\"\r\n\r\nThe piece alluded to is \"The Raven.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not true, as has been frequently alleged since Mr. Poe's death,\r\nthat his writings were above the popular taste, and therefore without a\r\nsuitable market in this country. His poems were worth as much to\r\nmagazines as those of Bryant or Longfellow, (though none of the\r\npublishers paid him half as large a price for them,) and his tales were\r\nas popular as those of Willis, who has been commonly regarded as the best\r\nmagazinist of his time. He ceased to write for _The Lady's  Book_ in\r\nconsequence of a quarrel induced by Mr. Godey's justifiable refusal to\r\nprint in that miscellany his \"Reply to Dr. English,\" and though in the\r\npoor fustian published under the signature of \"George R. Graham,\" in\r\nanswer to some remarks upon Poe's character in _The Tribune_, that\r\nindividual is made to assume a passionate friendship for the deceased\r\nauthor that would have become a Pythias, it is known that the personal\r\nill-will on both sides was such that for some four or five years _not a\r\nline by Poe was purchased for Graham's Magazine_. To quote again the\r\n\"Defense of Mr. Poe\" in the _Southern Literary Messenger_:\r\n\r\n\"His changeable humors, his irregularities, his caprices, his total\r\ndisregard of everything and body, save the fancy in his head, prevented\r\nhim from doing well in the world. The evils and sufferings that poverty\r\nbrought upon him, soured his nature, and deprived him of faith in human\r\nbeings. This was evident to the eye--he believed in nobody, and cared for\r\nnobody. Such a mental condition of course drove away all those who would\r\notherwise have stood by him in his hours of trial. He became, and was, an\r\nIshmaelite.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having, in no ungenerous spirit, presented the chief facts in Mr.\r\nPoe's history, not designedly exaggerating his genius, which none held in\r\nhigher admiration, not bringing into bolder relief than was just and\r\nnecessary his infirmities. I am glad to offer a portraiture of some of\r\nhis social qualities, equally beautiful, and--so changeable and\r\ninconsistent was the man--as far as it goes, truthful. Speaking of him\r\none day soon after his death, with the late Mrs. Osgood, the beauty of\r\nwhose character had made upon Poe's mind that impression which it never\r\nfailed to produce upon minds capable of the apprehension of the finest\r\ntraits in human nature, she said she did not doubt that my view of Mr.\r\nPoe, which she knew indeed to be the common view, was perfectly just, as\r\nit regarded him in his relations with men; but to women he was different,\r\nand she would write for me some recollections of him, to be placed beside\r\nmy harsher judgments in any notice of his life that the acceptance of the\r\nappointment to be his literary executor might render it necessary for me\r\nto give to the world. She was an invalid--dying of that consumption by\r\nwhich in a few weeks she was removed to heaven, and calling for pillows\r\nto support her while she wrote, she drew this sketch:\r\n\r\n\"You ask me, my friend, to write for you my reminiscences of Edgar Poe.\r\nFor you, who knew and understood my affectionate interest in him, and my\r\nfrank acknowledgment of that interest to all who had a claim upon my\r\nconfidence, for you, I will willingly do so. I think no one could know\r\nhim--no one _has_ known him personally--certainly no woman-without\r\nfeeling the same interest. I can sincerely say, that although I have\r\nfrequently _heard_ of aberrations on his part from the 'straight and\r\nnarrow path,' I have never _seen_ him otherwise than gentle, generous,\r\nwell-bred, and fastidiously refined. To a sensitive and\r\ndelicately-nurtured woman, there was a peculiar and irresistible charm in\r\nthe chivalric, graceful, and almost tender reverence with which he\r\ninvariably approached all women who won his respect. It was this which\r\nfirst commanded and always retained my regard for him.\r\n\r\n\"I have been told, that when his sorrows and pecuniary embarrassments had\r\ndriven him to the use of stimulants, which a less delicate organization\r\nmight have borne without injury, he was in the habit of speaking\r\ndisrespectfully of the ladies of his acquaintance. It is difficult for me\r\nto believe this; for to _me_, to whom he came during the year of our\r\nacquaintance for counsel and kindness in all his many anxieties and\r\ngriefs, he never spoke irreverently of any woman save one, and then only\r\nin _my_ defense; and though I rebuked him for his momentary\r\nforgetfulness of the respect due to himself and to me, I could not but\r\nforgive the offense for the sake of the generous impulse which prompted\r\nit. Yet even were these sad rumors true of him, the wise and\r\nwell-informed knew how to regard, as they would the impetuous anger of a\r\nspoiled infant, balked of its capricious will, the equally harmless and\r\nunmeaning phrensy of that stray child of Poetry and Passion. For the few\r\nunwomanly and slander-loving gossips who have injured _him_ and\r\n_themselves_ only by _repeating_ his ravings, when in such moods they\r\nhave accepted his society. I have only to vouchsafe my wonder and my\r\npity. They cannot surely harm the true and pure, who, reverencing his\r\ngenius, and pitying his misfortunes and his errors, endeavored, by their\r\ntimely kindness and sympathy, to soothe his sad career.\r\n\r\n\"It was in his own simple yet poetical home, that to me the character of\r\nEdgar Poe appeared in its most beautiful light. Playful, affectionate,\r\nwitty, alternately docile and wayward as a petted child-for his young,\r\ngentle, and idolized wife, and for all who came, he had, even in the\r\nmidst of his most harassing literary duties, a kind word, a pleasant\r\nsmile, a graceful and courteous attention. At his desk, beneath the\r\nromantic picture of his loved and lost Lenore, he would sit, hour after\r\nhour, patient, assiduous, and uncomplaining, tracing, in an exquisitely\r\nclear chirography, and with almost superhuman swiftness, the lightning\r\nthoughts--the 'rare and radiant' fancies as they flashed through his\r\nwonderful and ever-wakeful brain. I recollect, one morning, toward the\r\nclose of his residence in this city, when he seemed unusually gay and\r\nlight-hearted. Virginia, his sweet wife, had written me a pressing\r\ninvitation to come to them; and I, who never could resist her\r\naffectionate summons, and who enjoyed his society far more in his own\r\nhome than elsewhere, hastened to Amity-street. I found him just\r\ncompleting his series of papers entitled 'The Literati of New York.'\r\n'See,' said he, displaying, in laughing triumph, several little rolls of\r\nnarrow paper, (he always wrote thus for the press,) 'I am going to show\r\nyou, by the difference of length in these, the different degrees of\r\nestimation in which I hold all you literary people. In each of these, one\r\nof you is rolled up and fully discussed. Come, Virginia, help me!' And\r\none by one they unfolded them. At last they came to one which seemed\r\ninterminable. Virginia laughingly ran to one corner of the room with one\r\nend, and her husband to the opposite with the other. 'And whose\r\nlengthened sweetness long drawn out is that?' said I. 'Hear her!' he\r\ncried, 'just as if her little vain heart didn't tell her it's herself!'\r\n\r\n\"My first meeting with the poet was at the Astor House. A few days\r\nprevious. Mr. Willis had handed me, at the _table d'hote_, that strange\r\nand thrilling poem entitled 'The Raven,' saying that the author wanted my\r\nopinion of it. Its effect upon me was so singular, so like that of 'weird\r\nunearthly music,' that it was with a feeling almost of dread, I heard he\r\ndesired an introduction. Yet I could not refuse without seeming\r\nungrateful, because I had just heard of his enthusiastic and partial\r\neulogy of my writings, in his lecture on American Literature. I shall\r\nnever forget the morning when I was summoned to the drawing-room by Mr.\r\nWillis to receive him. With his proud and beautiful head erect, his dark\r\neyes flashing with the elective light of feeling and of thought, a\r\npeculiar, an inimitable blending of sweetness and hauteur in his\r\nexpression and manner, he greeted me, calmly, gravely, almost coldly; yet\r\nwith so marked an earnestness that I could not help being deeply\r\nimpressed by it. From that moment until his death we were friends;\r\nalthough we met only during the first year of our acquaintance. And in\r\nhis last words, ere reason had forever left her imperial throne in that\r\novertasked brain, I have a touching memento of his undying faith and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\"During that year, while traveling for my health, I maintained a\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Poe, in accordance with the earnest entreaties of\r\nhis wife, who imagined that my influence over him had a restraining and\r\nbeneficial effect. It _had_, as far as this--that having solemnly\r\npromised me to give up the use of stimulants, he so firmly respected his\r\npromise and me, as never once, during our whole acquaintance, to appear\r\nin my presence when in the slightest degree affected by them. Of the\r\ncharming love and confidence that existed between his wife and himself,\r\nalways delightfully apparent to me, in spite of the many little poetical\r\nepisodes, in which the impassioned romance of his temperament impelled\r\nhim to indulge; of this I cannot speak too earnestly--too warmly. I\r\nbelieve she was the only woman whom he ever truly loved; and this is\r\nevinced by the exquisite pathos of the little poem lately written, called\r\nAnnabel Lee, of which she was the subject, and which is by far the most\r\nnatural, simple, tender and touchingly beautiful of all his songs. I have\r\nheard it said that it was intended to illustrate a late love affair of\r\nthe author; but they who believe this, have in their dullness evidently\r\nmisunderstood or missed the beautiful meaning latent in the most lovely\r\nof all its verses--where he says,\r\n\r\n  \"'A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\r\n   My beautiful Annabel Lee,\r\n  So that her _high-born kinsmen_ came,\r\n   And bore her away from me.'\r\n\r\n\"There seems a strange and almost profane disregard of the sacred purity\r\nand spiritual tenderness of this delicious ballad, in thus overlooking\r\nthe allusion to the _kindred angels_ and the heavenly _Father_ of the\r\nlost and loved and unforgotten wife.\r\n\r\n\"But it was in his conversations and his letters, far more than in his\r\npublished poetry and prose writings, that the genius of Poe was most\r\ngloriously revealed. His letters were divinely beautiful, and for hours I\r\nhave listened to him, entranced by strains of such pure and almost\r\ncelestial eloquence as I have never read or heard elsewhere. Alas! in the\r\nthrilling words of Stoddard,\r\n\r\n  \"'He might have soared in the morning light,\r\n  But he built his nest with the birds of night;\r\n  But he lie in dust, and the stone is rolled\r\n  Over the sepulcher dim and cold;\r\n  He has canceled the ill he has done or said,\r\n  And gone to the dear and holy dead.\r\n  Let us forget the path he trod,\r\n  And leave him now to his Maker, God.'\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of Mr. Poe's aims and vicissitudes upon his literature, was\r\nmore conspicuous in his later than in his earlier writings. Nearly all\r\nthat he wrote in the last two or three years--including much of his best\r\npoetry,--was in some sense biographical: in draperies of his imagination,\r\nthose who take the trouble to trace his steps, will perceive, but\r\nslightly concealed, the figure of himself. The lineaments here disclosed,\r\nI think, are not different from those displayed in his biography, which\r\nis but a filling up of the picture. Thus far the few criticisms of his\r\nlife or works that I have ventured have been suggested by the immediate\r\nexamination of the points to which they referred. I add but a few words\r\nof more general description.\r\n\r\nIn person he was below the middle height, slenderly but compactly formed,\r\nand in his better moments he had in an eminent degree that air of\r\ngentlemanliness which men of a lower order seldom succeed in acquiring.\r\n\r\nHis conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence. His\r\nvoice was modulated with astonishing skill, and his large and variably\r\nexpressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who\r\nlistened, while his own face glowed, or was changeless in pallor, as his\r\nimagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His\r\nimagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision\r\nof genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply\r\ndefined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected the\r\nforms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of accretion,\r\nbuilt up his ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghastliest\r\ngrandeur, or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty--so minutely\r\nand distinctly, yet so rapidly, that the attention which was yielded to\r\nhim was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations--till he\r\nhimself dissolved the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and\r\nbase existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nHe was at all times a dreamer--dwelling in ideal realms--in heaven or\r\nhell--peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his brain. He\r\nwalked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in\r\nindistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer, (never for\r\nhimself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned,\r\nbut) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his\r\nidolatry;--or, with his glances introverted to a heart gnawed with\r\nanguish, and with a face shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest\r\nstorms; and all night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds\r\nand rains, would speak as if to spirits that at such times only could be\r\nevoked by him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals his disturbed soul\r\nsought to forget the ills to which his constitution subjected him--close\r\nby the Aidenn which were those he loved--the Aidenn which he might never\r\nsee, but in fitful glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less\r\nfiery and more happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the\r\ndoom of death. He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his\r\nwill and engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some\r\ncontrolling sorrow. The remarkable poem of \"The Raven\" was probably much\r\nmore nearly than has been supposed, even by those who were very intimate\r\nwith him, a reflection and an echo of his own history. _He_ was that\r\nbird's\r\n\r\n  \"----unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden\r\n  bore--\r\n  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n                            Of 'Never--never more.'\"\r\n\r\nEvery genuine author, in a greater or less degree, leaves in his works,\r\nwhatever their design, traces of his personal character; elements of his\r\nimmortal being, in which the individual survives the person. While we\r\nread the pages of the \"Fall of the House of Usher,\" or of \"Mesmeric\r\nRevelations,\" we see in the solemn and stately gloom which invests one,\r\nand in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both, indications of the\r\nidiosyncracies--of what was most remarkable and peculiar--in the author's\r\nintellectual nature. But we see here only the better phases of his\r\nnature, only the symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience\r\nhad deprived him of all faith, in man or woman. He had made up his mind\r\nupon the numberless complexities of the social world, and the whole\r\nsystem with him was an imposture. This conviction gave a direction to his\r\nshrewd and naturally unamiable character. Still, though he regarded\r\nsociety as composed altogether of villains, the sharpness of his\r\nintellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with villany,\r\nwhile it continually caused him by overshots to fail of the success of\r\nhonesty. He was in many respects like Francis Vivian, in Bulwer's novel\r\nof \"The Caxtons.\" Passion, in him, comprehended many of the worst\r\nemotions which militate against human happiness. You could not contradict\r\nhim, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak of wealth, but his\r\ncheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing natural advantages of this\r\npoor boy--his beauty, his readiness, the daring spirit that breathed\r\naround him like a fiery atmosphere--had raised his constitutional\r\nself-confidence into an arrogance that turned his very claims to\r\nadmiration into prejudices against him. Irascible, envious--bad enough,\r\nbut not the worst, for these salient angles were all varnished over with\r\na cold repellant cynicism, his passions vented themselves in sneers.\r\nThere seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and, what was more\r\nremarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the true point of\r\nhonor. He had, to a morbid excess, that desire to rise which is\r\nvulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the esteem or the love of his\r\nspecies; only the hard wish to succeed--not shine, not serve--succeed,\r\nthat he might have the right to despise a world which galled his\r\nself-conceit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"LAUGH AND GET FAT!\"\r\n\r\nBY JOHN KENYON\r\n\r\nLack we motives to laugh?

MARMIER.\r\n\r\nBY FAYETTE ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nToward the end of November, in the year 1831, one of those rude sleighs,\r\nmet with in winter on all the roads of Sweden, passed rapidly along the\r\nshores of the Gulf of Bothnia. For several hours the pale winter sun had\r\nbeen like a lamp extinguished beneath the horizon. The skies, however,\r\nhad that transparent clearness which is one of the charms of the nights\r\nof the north. Myriads of stars covered its surface with a network of\r\ngold, and glittered again on the snow which covered the surface of the\r\nearth. The wind was calm: space was silent. Nothing was heard but the\r\nsounds of the hoofs of two horses attached to a light vehicle, and\r\noccasionally the voice of the Swedish postillion, who from time to time\r\nurged them on by a word of affectionate reproach, or a joyous eulogium. A\r\ntraveler sat in the sleigh, wrapped up in heavy furs, and from time to\r\ntime cast aside the folds of the cloak which covered him, to take a\r\nthoughtful glance around him. A stranger in Sweden, he was traveling\r\nthrough it, and during the last month had experienced a multitude of\r\nemotions, altogether unexpected, and which seemed to increase as he drew\r\nnear the north. After having crossed the southern provinces of that\r\nkingdom bounded by the Baltic, and those on the vast silver basin of Lake\r\nMilar, seen Stockholm in all its pride, Upsal, the city of the ancient\r\ngods, and Gébel, the active and industrious, he found himself amid a\r\nregion entirely silent, inanimate, and wrapped in a snowy pall. Soon he\r\npenetrated the bosom of a long pine forest, the shafts of which seemed,\r\nas it were, giants wrapped in cloaks of white. Now he ascended steep\r\nhills, then rapidly hurried to the Gulf, the shores of which the waves\r\nhad made to look like point-lace, and looked up at the immense rocks on\r\nwhich the waters broke.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the same silence existed. Far in the distance a light was seen\r\nto shine, either the glitter of a woodman's fire, or the midnight torch\r\nkindled by some invalid. This light, fixed like a point in space, was but\r\nanother evidence of the isolation of man in these regions.\r\n\r\nIn this inanimateness of nature, in this sad uniformity of plains of\r\nsnow, in this desert of fields and woods, such sadness, such distress was\r\nevident, that the heart of the traveler, who however was young and brave,\r\nwas filled with a kind of mysterious fear. Before him, among all the\r\nother stars, shone that of the pole, that faithful light which is nightly\r\nkindled like a pharos, and in the seasons of storm, smiles on the pilgrim\r\nwho has gone astray, and guides the navigator's steps. The stranger, for\r\na few instants, kept his eyes fixed on this benevolent light, as if to\r\nfind some relief to the impressions he had received from the melancholy\r\nappearance of the earth. He then tapped the postillion on the shoulder,\r\nand said to him, with the laconism compulsory on him from his knowledge\r\nof the Swedish tongue, \"_Aland?_\" This was the name of the halting-place.\r\n\"_Intet tu,_\" (not yet,) replied the postillion, as he took his arm from\r\nthe sheepskin which surrounded his shoulders. At the same time he cracked\r\nhis whip, as if to show how impatient he was to reach his halting-place.\r\nThe animals, thus excited, set forth at a long gallop across that portion\r\nof the Gulf where the frequent passage of the fishermen had to a degree\r\nleveled the snow, and ascended with much difficulty a hill covered by\r\ntrees at least a hundred years old. At the extremity of this forest, the\r\npostillion turned toward the traveler, and with his finger pointed out to\r\nhim a spot so distant that it could be distinguished with difficulty.\r\n\"_Aland!_\" said he; and with his voice and gestures he encouraged his\r\nhorses, who doubled their ardor, as if they comprehended that this was\r\nthe last effort which would be required of them before they reached their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nThe sleigh soon halted at the foot of a vast wooden house. When the\r\ndriver cracked his whip, when the sound of the bells was heard, the door\r\nopened, and the stranger, it was evident to see, was expected. A servant\r\nadvanced to meet him, with a lantern in his hand, and led him through a\r\nlong corridor, introducing him into a room where a man with gray hair sat\r\nin an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"My uncle!\" said the traveler, rushing toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Ireneus, my dear child!\" said the old man. They stood in silence,\r\nclasped in each other's arms, until the old man, taking the young one by\r\nthe hand, led him to a table on which two lights were burning, looked at\r\nhim with complaisance, and said, \"It is indeed yourself--it is the\r\nlikeness of my poor brother: the same eyes, the same proud and resolute\r\nair. You look as he did thirty years ago, when he was about to cast\r\nhimself amid the dangers of war; when, unfortunately, he embraced me for\r\nthe last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear uncle,\" said Ireneus, \"instead of the brother you have lost, a\r\nson comes to you. In my early youth, my mother taught me to love you.\r\nThat duty I shall be glad to discharge.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very sound of his voice!\" continued the old man, who still looked at\r\nhim; \"the very sparkle of his eye! No painter could have made a more\r\nexact portrait. May you, however, have a far different destiny. Fatality\r\nweighs on the family of Vermondans. May you, the only vigorous offshoot\r\nof that old race of soldiers, already stricken by misfortune, already an\r\nexile from your country, never learn, as your father and I did, how\r\nbitter is the bread of the stranger--how difficult it is to go up and\r\ndown the stranger's staircase. But what do I say? You are in another\r\nfather's house. You come to it like a long-expected child, and you meet\r\nwith two sisters.\" Then going toward the door of another room, he said,\r\n\"Ebba, Alete, come to welcome your cousin.\"\r\n\r\nTwo young girls entered immediately. One of them was lively and active,\r\nwith black eyes and a ruddy complexion; the other pale, fair, and\r\ndelicate. The first gave her hand gaily to Ireneus, and kissed him on\r\nboth cheeks; the other advanced timidly, and with downcast eyes, leaning\r\nher brow forward to be kissed.\r\n\r\n\"My dear cousins,\" said Ireneus, \"my mother would have been delighted, as\r\nI am, to have seen you; but being unable to make this long journey in\r\nSweden, has sent you at least a token of her affection.\" As he spoke, he\r\ntook from his pocket a little morocco box, which the agile Alete took and\r\nopened with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"What pretty ear-rings!\" said she; \"what a charming ring! See that little\r\nblue cross, and the bracelet set with emeralds. Such jewels are made only\r\nin Paris. Come look at them, Ebba!\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Ebba stood aside motionless and silent. She then\r\napproached the table on which her sister had displayed the jewels, and\r\nlooked at them without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Is not this pretty?\" said Alete. \"We must divide them; and as I have a\r\nlover who will make it a point of honor to give me as many ornaments as\r\nmy whim dictates and his fortune will permit, I wish you to take the\r\nlarger part.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Ebba, with a voice soft as that of a child, \"as you are about\r\nto be married you should have all as a wedding present. If you will\r\nhowever let me keep this little cross, I shall be very grateful.\"\r\n\r\nAlete, who under the mask of frivolity concealed a tender and delicate\r\nheart, sought in vain to overcome the modesty of her sister; and finally,\r\nwith much reluctance, received three-quarters of the jewel-case.\r\n\r\n\"Now, young ladies,\" said their father, who had been an observer of this\r\ncontest of generosity, \"remember that your cousin has made a long\r\njourney. See if his room is in order and if supper is ready; for when one\r\nhas passed the whole day in crossing our snow-plains, some comfort is\r\nrequired.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are good and affectionate children,\" continued the father, when\r\nthey had gone out. \"The eldest is a gipsy who delights me with her\r\ngayety; the youngest often moves me even to tears. Her mother died in\r\ngiving birth to her. The poor girl seems constantly under the influence\r\nof the misfortune which presided over her birth.\r\n\r\n\"None of the things in which girls of her age delight, please or excite\r\nher. Her silent and retiring life, seems one long act of resignation.\r\nShe finds interest in story and books alone. She has learned three or\r\nfour languages, and read all the books either here or at the parsonage.\r\nWhen, however, she is in society, one would fancy her a very ignorant\r\nperson, so little does she say and so anxious does she appear to conceal\r\nher information. Her modesty is disturbed by no vanity, and the placidity\r\nof her meditations is interrupted by no vulgar commotion. One might\r\nalmost fancy her a stranger to this world, indifferent to its\r\ncalculations, lost to its joys, and submitting without effort to its\r\nsorrows. I have never seen her smile, but I have never heard her\r\ncomplain. Delicate and weak, the paleness of her face, the languor of her\r\nappearance, betray a physical suffering she herself denies.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as she perceives that I remark any indisposition in her, her\r\ncountenance becomes illuminated by a gentle light, her lips are gilded\r\nwith a sweet smile, as if she begged me to excuse the uneasiness she had\r\ninspired me with.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, dear Ireneus, for this unscrupulous thrusting on you of my\r\npaternal egotism. I should first have inquired after you and your hopes\r\nwhich were crushed so soon. Ebba, however, is ever a cause of anxiety to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus replied to this confidence by cordially clasping his hand. Just\r\nat that moment it was announced that the table was served.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the old man, \"you will not find here the gastronomical\r\nniceties of Paris. Like plain country people, we live on the produce of\r\nthe soil. A good bottle of old beer, however, has some merit, and\r\nvarieties of game are found in our forests, for which the _gourmets_ of\r\nParis would willingly exchange their hares and partridges.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus sat between his two cousins, and his youthful appetite, sharpened\r\nby the journey he had made, delighted the old man. As he ate large slices\r\nof the haunch of a reindeer, and drank cup after cup of a savory beer,\r\nprepared with particular care by Alete, he contrived to look at the young\r\ngirls on each side of him.\r\n\r\nThe eldest, always in motion, waited on her cousin and her father, went\r\nto the kitchen, sat again at the table, and when she laughed disclosed\r\ntwo rows of pearl between her rose-colored lips. She was indeed a\r\ncharming girl, round and dimpled as a child, fresh and gay as a bird,\r\nwith every gesture graceful, though she was a little espiegle and\r\ncoquettish. Her coquetry, however, was naive and chaste, of a kind which\r\nin many women is but the amiable manifestation of a sentiment of\r\nbenevolence, and an innocent desire to be agreeable.\r\n\r\nIreneus took pleasure in looking at her, and as she immediately acquired\r\nself-possession, she conferred the same privilege on others. She already\r\njested with him as if he had been an old friend, and he felt himself\r\nas unconstrained as if he had passed his whole life with her. When,\r\nhowever, he looked at Ebba, it was with strange emotion. Nothing in his\r\nwhole life had ever touched him so. The countenance of the young girl\r\nhad a cold marble whiteness, making it assume the appearance of a statue,\r\nwrought in the most artistic manner.\r\n\r\nTwo long tresses of yellow hair fell over her cheeks, and disclosed a\r\nbrow of ideal serenity. Her pale face was lit up with eyes clear as\r\ncrystal, and blue and deep as lakes reflecting the skies. Any one who had\r\nonce looked into her eyes could not forget them. Often they drooped\r\nbeneath the lids, like a heart overcome with grief sheltering itself\r\nbeneath a cloud. When they were lifted up no earthly desire animated\r\nthem, and in their vague radiation they seemed to look into the infinite.\r\n\r\nThere are plants which the dew and sun do not completely develop. There\r\nare beings like weak plants, attached to earth by but feeble roots, and\r\nwho from their very birth seem predestined to misfortune, and who, by\r\na kind of second-sight, made aware of the fate which awaits them, attach\r\nthemselves with fear and trembling to a world in which they anticipate\r\nonly an ephemeral existence and cruel deception. Their sadness is\r\nreflected on those who approach them. There is as it were a fatal circle\r\naround them, in which all feel themselves seized with indescribable fear,\r\nand with the evidences of sympathy entertained for them is mingled a kind\r\nof commiseration.\r\n\r\nIreneus experienced at the appearance of Ebba this sentiment of\r\nuneasiness and melancholy sympathy. When after supper he bade adieu to\r\nhis uncle and cousins, when he was alone in his room, he smiled when he\r\nremembered the amiable gayety of Alete, but became sad and pensive when\r\nhe recalled the dreamy look of her young sister, the sad melancholy\r\nglance which shone over her face like the twilight of an autumn day.\r\n\r\nIreneus was not however one of those sentimental beings belonging to the\r\nByronic or German school. His mind was rather energetic than tender; it\r\nwas rather ardent than despairing. The son of a brave country gentleman\r\nwho had devoted fortune and life to the cause of legitimacy, and after\r\nhaving followed the princes in their various emigrations, had died for\r\nthem in the wilderness of la Vendée. Ireneus had been the inheritor of\r\nthat obstinate will which never deviates from the end it proposes to\r\nitself, and of a chivalric worship of the Royal family, which to him\r\nseemed by a law divine to be invested with the imprescriptible right to\r\ngovern France. Of the large fortune which formerly belonged to his\r\nfamily, the revolution had left him but a dilapidated castle, a few\r\nfields and forests, the revenue of which scarcely sufficed to support his\r\nmother in comfort.\r\n\r\nThe condition of his fortune did not permit him to lead an idle life. His\r\nbirth made his profession certain. He entered Saint-Cyr, and left it with\r\nthe best possible recommendations. He could also appeal to the traditions\r\nof his fathers services. Through the union of these two claims he was so\r\nrapidly advanced that at twenty-eight he was already Captain of the\r\nLancers of the Guard, with an honorable name, a handsome person, some\r\nintelligence and that elegance of manners inherent in the class to which\r\nhe belonged, and which to us is known as the aristocracy, the young\r\nnobleman might without presumption anticipate a brilliant future. His\r\nmother amid the silence of her provincial castle followed him step by\r\nstep, with pride, and her solitary dreams saw him the husband of a rich\r\nheiress, Colonel and aide-de-camp of a prince, deputy and peer of France.\r\nWho can tell how vague were the hopes entertained in relation to that\r\nchild in whom all her hopes were centered!\r\n\r\nHis mother was lost in this study and observation of castles in the air,\r\nwhen the revolutions of July burst forth like a thunderbolt, and at one\r\nblow overturned all her aerial edifices.\r\n\r\nIreneus was at Paris when this terrible contest, the result of which was\r\nthe overturning of a monarchy, began with the crushing of a throne. He\r\nfought with the ardor inspired at once by his love of legitimacy and his\r\ninnate horror of the revolutionary flag. On the first day he had the\r\nhonor of resisting with his company a numerous body of insurgents, and\r\nsucceeded in protecting the post which had been confided to him. On the\r\nsecond day, after a desperate contest, the danger of which served only to\r\nmagnify his courage, he fell from his horse with a ball through his\r\nchest. His soldiers who were devoted to him bore him to a house where he\r\nwas kindly treated. A few hours after, a General who had seen him in the\r\nbattle, sent him the brevet of Major. It was an empty honor, for the hand\r\nwhich signed this promotion soon renounced all human grandeur and all\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe wound of Ireneus was severe. The kind attentions however which\r\nsurrounded, protected him from danger of death. As soon as he was\r\nbeginning to grow well, he went to his mother's house, where his cure\r\nwas completed. There he heard of the new exile of those for whom his\r\nfather had shed his blood and of the establishment of the new monarchy.\r\nMany of his friends were soon induced to connect themselves with the new\r\nmonarchy which retained them in service, and even conferred special\r\ncompliments on them, and they wrote to induce him to follow their\r\nexample. Such a thought never entered his mind. Without partaking of the\r\nexaggerated hatred of many of the Legitimists against the new monarchy,\r\nhe had stated that he would never serve it. He was not a man to violate a\r\npromise. But he was subject to the danger of inactivity, the greatest\r\ntorment of active and strong minds. As an ambitious man examines with\r\ngreat uneasiness the path which leads him to power, as the speculator\r\ncontemplates the capricious whims of fortune, as the young officer\r\nwaiting orders looks in every direction for action, did Ireneus. More\r\nthan once he resolved to join his fortunes with those of the exiled\r\nprinces in the arena of public opinion. They however had submitted to\r\ntheir fate, and no longer appealed to their faithful servants. The time\r\nof Royal crusades had gone by. Sovereigns made uneasy by the\r\neffervescence of revolutions, which like a contagion spread over Europe,\r\nhad enough to do to secure their own thrones, and had no disposition to\r\nruin themselves in lifting up that of a neighbor.\r\n\r\nMadame de Vermondans, after striving in vain to amuse her son, induced\r\nhim to visit his uncle in Sweden, hoping that travel would restore quiet\r\nto his mind. It was one of those healthful remedies which often escape\r\nthe observation of science, and are suggested only by the ingenuity of\r\ntenderness. Nothing in certain moral diseases is more efficacious than\r\ntravel. He who after having enjoyed all the emotions of active life,\r\nfinds himself at once condemned to the sterility of idleness, suffers\r\nunder a perpetual fever. Within him there is as it were an ever-acting\r\nspring he strives with a constant effort to repress.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual and physical faculties, his imagination, his senses seek\r\nto resume their old power. If the forces with which he is endowed, if the\r\nabundant grasp of his mind are paralyzed in their motion, these forces\r\nweigh on him like a useless burden. Soon in consequence of the internal\r\ncontest he has undergone, the constant desires he has given vent to, from\r\nthe very exuberance of life, which finding no outlet, recoils on itself,\r\nhe becomes a victim of the demon of satiety. To escape from its rude\r\ngrasp, air and space are required. The victim must be borne from the\r\nnarrow circle within which he is riveted as by a chain, which clasps his\r\nframe. He must shake from himself every chimera, and to enable him to\r\nforget himself, the aspect of strange lands, of scenes and pictures\r\nwhich one after the other exhibit themselves before him, all that\r\nforcibly attracts the attention, all that occupies the mind in a new\r\nland, material cares, unexpected incidents, the surprises of travel, and\r\nyet more the magical influence of nature, are required to restore tone to\r\nthe sick soul.\r\n\r\nIreneus had really experienced the effect of this moral remedy. In his\r\njourney across Germany and the North, he had not recovered his early\r\nimpetus, his natural ardor, but he at least felt himself master of\r\nhimself. He reached his uncle's house in the happiest possible\r\ndisposition of mind.\r\n\r\nWhen he arose on the next day, he took occasion to remark the delicate\r\nPrecaution taken to render his sojourn pleasant as possible. The\r\nfurniture of maple or birch was plain, but wonderfully neat; the bed\r\nlinen was of snowy whiteness and purity; and perfumed by aromatic plants\r\nwith which in the drawers it had been strewed. Here and there were a few\r\nchoice engravings, and on the floor was a carpet woven by his two\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\nAt the very dawn of day a servant came to open the earthen stove, which\r\nstood on the hearth like a vast column, and placed in it an armfull of\r\nthe pitch pine, which sent out jets of flame and a perfume which filled\r\nthe whole room. Double windows protected this room also against the\r\nseverity of the weather. Between them was a bed of flocks of wool on\r\nwhich the young girls had placed artificial flowers, as if to preserve in\r\nthe nudity of winter the smiling image of spring. Here windows looked out\r\non a landscape which in the summer time must have presented a charming\r\naspect. The house of M. Vermondans stood on a hill, on the brow of which\r\nwas a breast of pines. In front of the principal façade was a garden with\r\na proclivity toward the lake, which was surrounded and sheltered by a\r\nbelt of trees. In the distance the peasants' houses were seen, the tall\r\nclock spire of Aland, and far in the distance the chimneys of the furnace\r\nbelonging to M. de Vermondans. At this moment, the plain, the\r\nsnow-covered woods, the frozen lake presented one uniform color. Any one,\r\nhowever, might see they would present beautiful landscapes, when the sun\r\ncalled forth the field-flowers, made the forests lifeful, and gilded the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIreneus went to his uncle's room. He found the old man rested in an arm\r\nchair, with his legs crossed and a long pipe in his mouth.\r\n\r\nM. de Vermondans was not one of those persons who willingly distress\r\nthemselves about what the poets call the miseries of human life. He took\r\nthings as they came, and enjoyed prosperity without imagining future\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nWhile young, he had fought with his brothers the battles of legitimacy.\r\nLike his brother, he entertained a mortal hatred for revolutionary\r\nrabble: gradually, like many others, he had begun to reason on the\r\nmatter, and become so tolerant that his doctrines reached the point\r\nalmost of carelessness. Just as her [sic] nephew came in, he was\r\nreflecting and _quasi_ confirmed in the wisdom of his principles. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid he, as if he continued a conversation already begun, \"yes, my\r\nfriend, I am as much opposed as you are to a stormy revolution. I left my\r\nfather's house, I abandoned my patrimony to accompany our princes into\r\nexile. I have fought for them, in their holy cause I received a sabre cut\r\non the arm, which every now and then, by a very disagreeable sensation,\r\nrecalls my youthful patriotism to me. Soon, however, the idle pretensions\r\nof my comrades, the disputes of our chiefs, repressed my ardor. I left\r\none of the cohorts in which reason was treated as treachery, and where\r\nboasting alone was listened to with complacency. There firmness and\r\ncomplaisance were paralyzed now by erroneous movements and next by\r\ncontradictory orders. A faithful servant contrived to save a portion of\r\nmy estate, and at the peril of his own life brought me twenty thousand\r\nfrancs in gold. With this sum I came to Sweden, knowing that here\r\neverything was cheap, and determined to buy a small estate on which I\r\nmight live, until I could find an opportunity of serving to some purpose\r\nthat cause to which my heart was devoted, and which I had never yet\r\nentirely abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"At Stockholm one of those strange rencontres which we attribute to\r\nchance, but which the pious with more propriety think originate in\r\nProvidence, made me acquainted with a land-holder in Angermania, named\r\nGuldberg, as good a man as ever lived. I am indebted to him for all my\r\nprosperity, and I bless his memory. M. Guldberg had discovered a rich\r\nmineral deposit on his estate, was anxious to establish a furnace, and\r\nsought for some one to aid him in his enterprise. In the course of my\r\nstudies I had acquired some ideas of hydraulics and mechanics, trifling\r\nenough it is true, but one day conversation having been directed to these\r\nmatters, Guldberg, who knew even less than I did, appeared delighted with\r\nmy explanations, and asked me to aid him in his projected enterprise.\r\nWithout reflecting more than he did when he made the offer, I consented.\r\nI came hither with him: I superintended the construction and the first\r\nlabor of the furnace you see glowing there. I was not unlike the ignorant\r\nteacher who  studies in the morning the lesson he teaches in the\r\nafternoon. I made more than one unfortunate experiment. I committed more\r\nthan one error, but at last I got our establishment under way. Guldberg\r\nhad suffered patiently, and never complained of the mistakes I had made,\r\nand now appeared most grateful for my success. He very generously offered\r\nme a share of the profits of an enterprise which from the very\r\ncommencement promised the most favorable results. From this time\r\ncommences a series of derogations I now look on as so many wise\r\nresolutions, but which many would look on as acts of apostasy. Here I am,\r\na French noble, with I know not how many illustrious quarters,\r\ncompromising my escatcheon in an industrial occupation. This was the\r\nfirst derogation. Guldberg had an only daughter, very interesting, and\r\nwho pleased me. She had the kindness to show that I was not disagreeable;\r\nshe however had not a drop of noble blood, not even a single quartering.\r\nI married her, much to your father's discontent. That was my second\r\nderogation. This woman during her life was the very impersonation of\r\nvirtue, but was a protestant, and asked me as a favor that if our\r\nchildren were female, they might be educated in her faith. My two\r\ndaughters believe as their mother did. That is the third derogation.\r\n\r\n\"An honest young fellow has courted the eldest of these girls. He is the\r\nson of a priest, and will go into orders himself if he does not become\r\nprofessor of a college. I saw my dear Alete had confidence in him. I\r\nconsented that she should marry a plebeian and a heretic. In this was\r\ncomprised the fourth and fifth derogation. I suffered the revolutionary\r\ncrisis of France to pass without exciting me: I have learned through the\r\npapers that our dear country, the most intelligent in the world, has\r\nsuccessively adulated and cursed the bloody tyranny of Robespiere, the\r\ngallantry of Barras, the Consulate, Empire and the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\"When the lilies replaced the tricolor, and the amiable people of Paris\r\ncast themselves before the troops of the white-horse of Monsieur, with\r\nthe same enthusiasm they had a few years before manifested at the\r\nappearance of the proud charger of the conqueror of Wagram and Jena, I\r\nremained here and never changed my colors: I never cried 'down with the\r\nCorsican Ogre.' Smoking my pipe in peace, I watched my furnace, smiled on\r\nmy children and my harvests, in the sunlight of Sweden, which would be so\r\ndelightful if it were a little less rare. This was another and a terrible\r\nderogation.\r\n\r\n\"Gradually, however, dear Ireneus, I built up a faith to suit myself,\r\nfound, I think, in the works of no philosopher (I read but little), but\r\nwhich yet seems to me a very good rule of conduct, inasmuch as it leaves\r\nthe conscience at ease and makes me as happy as any one can be in this\r\nvalley of tears. I therefore think, dear Ireneus, that in our benevolence\r\nwe make monsters of certain ideas which we imbibe when we are children,\r\nand to which, without examination, we always submit ourselves. I think\r\nthat without violating any true principle of morality, without ceasing to\r\nbe, in any respect, a moral man, we may break some links of that network\r\nof traditions spun for us by our teachers at so much an hour, and which\r\nthrows a hood over us as it is thrown over a falcon, to keep it from\r\nflying in the infinitude of space. I respect every sincere belief, even\r\nhat which I look on as a prejudice, and I insist that my own be\r\nrespected. As a conclusion of my profession of faith, I am willing to\r\nadmit that even a republican convinced of the justness of his opinions\r\nappears as reasonable to me as a monarchist, and that a quaker or\r\nCalvinist is as near heaven as the devout Catholic.\r\n\r\n\"When my mind lifts itself up toward God, I imagine him the\r\nrepresentative and originater of all good, and I am convinced that the\r\nsurest way to approach him, to merit his favor and win his blessing, is,\r\nin the circle in which we are, whether large or small, to do as much good\r\nas possible. I say, that the workingman, who toils for a short time to\r\nassist his invalid neighbor, acquires more merit than the rich man, who\r\nwith an icy hand casts his coin into the lap of the indigent. I have the\r\naudacity to think that a king, who in the splendor of his court is\r\nforgetful of the suffering of his people; that a noble, who abandons\r\nhimself to all the enjoyments of his fortune, forgetful of misery\r\nlanguishing at his castle gate, are great criminals; and that God will\r\npunish their misdeeds, either on them, or, as the Bible says, 'on their\r\nchildren even until the fourth and fifth generation.'\"\r\n\r\nIreneus, who had listened in silence to this long profession of faith,\r\nasked himself if it was worth while to contradict it. The words of his\r\nuncle were contradictory of one of those doctrines, which are the more\r\ndifficult to shake, as they have their hold in the philosophy of the\r\nheart, and are fenced around with many noble sentiments. His loyalty,\r\nhowever, seemed to require some reply, and he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I understand well enough, my dear uncle, the chain of circumstances\r\nwhich has led you almost to lay aside the principles which now seem\r\nprejudices to you. I myself willingly immolate on the altar of new ideas\r\nthat pride of nobility which delights in the study of old parchments, and\r\nmakes a kind of fetish of scutcheons carved on the walls of an ancient\r\ncastle. I condemn as a foolish error, the airs of superiority affected by\r\nold nobles in respect to merit sprung from the people; and if, in the\r\nopinion of my father, your marriage with the daughter of your friend,\r\nseemed a degradation, forgive him. Remember that he died at an epoch of\r\nstrife and convulsion in which every noble defended, with the greatest\r\npossible ardor, the prerogatives of his rank, which he saw were attacked\r\nby the maddest passion, and were in danger of being lost. Since then we\r\nhave made much progress. The barriers which formerly divided society into\r\ntwo classes have been destroyed, space has been opened for every one to\r\ncarve his own way, and the people participate in governments, and in the\r\nroyal councils.\r\n\r\n\"The majority of the ministers of the Restoration were chosen from among\r\nthe people. In relation to this, I admit all the reasonings of the\r\nphilosophers of the eighteenth century, and of the liberals of our own\r\ntimes. In them I find expansion of heart, intelligence, and I care not\r\nfor genealogy. The qualities of mind, grace and beauty seem to me signs\r\nof distinction marked by the finger of God, who is wiser far than\r\nD'Hozier.[A] I cannot, however, forget that this race of nobles, so\r\ncruelly persecuted thirty years ago, so often trampled on in our own\r\ntimes, was the glory and the power of France. I was forced with pain to\r\nsee with what incessant malignity this race, though stripped of its\r\nancient power, was attacked. I have often said that in sapping the\r\nfoundations of the aristocratic edifice, that in crushing the legitimacy\r\nof the nobles, an attack was made on the legitimacy of monarchy. The\r\nrevolution just over has but too well justified my apprehensions. This\r\nrevolution which by a species of criminal conversion, selects one of the\r\nold royal blood to occupy the throne of the exile, which selects the one\r\nnearest the throne, is perhaps but the first of a series of convulsions,\r\nin which will be engulfed, by ambition and pride, the wisdom and\r\nexperience of the past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A genealogist of great repute in France, twenty years\r\nsince.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the uncle and nephew was interrupted by the\r\nsound of a horse's hoofs, dragging a sleigh rapidly toward the door of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"That is beyond doubt my future son-in-law,\" said M. de Vermondans,\r\n\"another philosopher, who, like yourself, does not in every respect agree\r\nwith you. He is, however, a good fellow, who under a by no means\r\naristocratic exterior conceals the noblest qualities.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she heard the sleigh, Alete ran to the door sill; and Ebba followed\r\nhim. At the appearance of the two sisters, like a rose and a lily, the\r\nyoung man hastened to divest himself of the thick fur which enwrapped\r\nhim, sprang from the sleigh, and hastened to his betrothed. He had not,\r\nhowever, remembered the caprice of Alete, who, instead of giving him her\r\nhand as usual, looked sternly at him, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you are incorrigible. How comes that waistcoat to be buttoned\r\nwrong? And why has that cravat wings, like those of a crow? Why does your\r\nshirt-collar come up to your ears? Is this the fruit of the lessons on\r\nthe toilette, which I have so often given you? Did I not also order you\r\nto attend to your hair, and not let it fall on your shoulder, like two\r\nbundles of flax, in disorder? You do not know that we have here a cousin\r\nfrom Paris, who will take you for a Goth, or the Lord knows what.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor young man, stupefied at this reception, looked down\r\nmechanically, with his hand on his waistcoat and his cravat, and did not\r\ndare to approach his rigorous mistress.\r\n\r\n\"Alete, Alete,\" said Ebba, with a voice of supplication, \"how can you be\r\nso cruel!\"\r\n\r\nAlete, satisfied beyond doubt by the respectful submission with which her\r\nReproaches had been received, sprang to the neck of her betrothed, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\"But I love my dear Eric truly. If I sometimes play the magnificent with\r\nhim, it is to make him think that he has himself, in a noble epistle,\r\ncalled me his sovereign. Is not this so, Eric?\" added she, leaning toward\r\nhim like a petted child. \"Do you not weary of my little wickednesses? At\r\npresent, you see, I use the remnant of my liberty: when we are married,\r\nhowever, I shall be a model of obedience.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of Eric had already become lighted up, and he kissed with\r\npleasure the little hand placed in his.\r\n\r\nAlete seemed to fear nothing so much as these sentimental manifestations,\r\nand took him into the room where the uncle and nephew had their political\r\ncontest, and pausing before Ireneus, said,\r\n\r\n\"Cousin, permit me to introduce to you M. Eric Goldberg, Doctor of the\r\nUniversity of Upsal, and a learned Grecian, who never in his life read a\r\nsingle line of the _Journal des Modes_, and cannot conceive of the\r\ndifference between a good and bad tailor; who would not know how to hold\r\na fan; or to perform a contradance, but who, in spite of all that, is one\r\nof the best fellows in the world, and is devoted to your cousin.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this singular introduction, a faint blush spread over the face of\r\nthe young doctor. A clasp of the hand, and an affectionate word, however,\r\nfrom Ireneus, put an end to all embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"A strange girl,\" said M. de Vermondans, following Alete with his eye as\r\nshe hurried to the kitchen to take charge of the preparations for dinner.\r\n\"Is not that an odd introduction of her husband and lover? She never does\r\nthings, however, like other people. Be seated, dear Eric, though, and\r\ntell me why we have not seen you for three days. We had began to be\r\nuneasy about you, and Alete often looked toward the window. Had you not\r\ncome to-day, I should have sent to ask the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father has been a little unwell,\" replied  Eric; as he placed his\r\nhands, made red by the cold, near the stove. \"I had to remain to assist\r\nhim in some of his duties, and to amuse him by reading to him. This\r\nmorning, as I learned that Monsieur--Monsieur--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say at once your cousin,\" said Ireneus, frankly.\r\n\r\n\"That my cousin\" resumed the timid Eric, with more confidence, \"had\r\narrived, I was unwilling to remain longer away, and my father was kind\r\nenough not to wish to retain me.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Upsal student pronounced these few simple words, Ireneus observed\r\nhim, and discovered in his face such an expression of kindness, and in\r\nhis clear blue eyes such intelligence that he felt a real sympathy for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said he, \"for thinking of me before you knew me. I hope\r\nthat when we shall be acquainted you will grant me a portion of the love\r\nyou have conferred on my family. I am already disposed to love you as a\r\ncousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Eric, springing up, and glancing at Ireneus with an\r\nexpression of radiant joy, \"how happy I am at what you say! I was afraid.\r\nI will confess, that I might find in you one of those careless men of the\r\nworld, as we hear most of the Parisians are. I see, however, you are a\r\nworthy nephew of him I shall soon call uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Alete, who from the door had, with a pleasant smile on\r\nher face, heard this amicable exchange of sentiments, \"will you be\r\npleased to come to dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they any caviar?\" asked M. de Vermondans.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, and as good as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can give this Parisian a complete specimen of the gastronomical\r\nrefinements of our out-kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must know, Ireneus,\" said he, as he led his nephew to a little table\r\nplaced in the corner of the dining-room, \"that we do not commerce our\r\nmeal as the rest of the world does. Our good ancestors certainly\r\ndiscovered, that the walls of the stomach being contracted by cold,\r\nneeded to be refreshed by something spirituous, and from time to time\r\nthis estimable precaution has been perpetuated in the country. We will\r\ntherefore first take a glass of this brandy, and then a cake of this\r\ncaviar, a few anchovies, and a slice or two of ham, after which we will\r\nreally sit at the festal board, where the soup, to which you assign the\r\nfirst rank, appears only as a secondary entree, after many culinary\r\npreparations.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done to the great amusement of Ireneus, who really would have\r\ntaken for the dinner itself the prelude to it.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sat down, Alete undertook to put him through a course of\r\nnational gastronomy.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think,\" asked she, \"of the fish to which my father has just\r\nhelped you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very good,\" replied Ireneus, \"and resemble smelts.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by smelts? They are doubtless some tasteless product of\r\nyour warm rivers. Know, Monsieur, that these are stroemlings, the finest\r\nand most delicate fish in the icy waters of the north. This other fish,\r\nwhich glows like a piece of gold in its porcelain plate, you would find\r\nit difficult to call by the correct name. It is a salmon, caught by a\r\nskillful hand, and smoked with particular care. Near you is the tongue of\r\na reindeer, prepared by a Laplander, unrivaled in this useful art. This\r\nbird, which yet looks fixedly at you with open eyes, though it died two\r\ndays ago, you might fancy a barn-door fowl, fattened up by the cook. Not\r\nso: it is the briar-cock, the honor of our forests. The two fowls in that\r\ndish are not a pair of vulgar pullets, but succulent grouse. I will not\r\nmention that haunch of sanglier, which, however, is worthy of a royal\r\ntable; nor of those vegetables, which strangers say are nowhere as finely\r\nflavored as they are in our loved Sweden; nor of those berries, gathered\r\nlast fall on the sides of our hills. Pay some attention, however, to that\r\nbread which you break so carelesely with your fingers. It is not coarse\r\nand heavy, like that of other countries. It is our _kneach-brad_,\r\ndelicate and light as a sheet of paper, and white as the purest flour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you done?\" said M. de Vermondans; \"and can you not, as an\r\naccompaniment to so many exquisite things, bring us a bottle of claret?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong again.\" said Alete; \"as if this beer, prepared from the best\r\nbarley, the most perfumed hops, yellow as the Baltic, amber and pure as\r\nspring-water, was not more valuable than the coarse red fluid you send to\r\nsuch a distance for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" said Ireneus, who in his turn wished to laugh at the\r\nyoung girl. \"It seems to me, that when seated in front of the riches of\r\nthe north, it would be a profanation to pour out a libation in a foreign\r\nbeverage. This beer has besides so excellent a flavor, that were there\r\nanything like it in France, it is probable that the owners of the Clos de\r\nVaugeot and Medoc would root out their vines to make room for hops and\r\nbarley.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are laughing at me, dear cousin,\" said Alete; \"take care, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peste!\" said M. de Vermondans, \"any one who knows you would be rash\r\nindeed to excite your ceaseless babble. I do not think that Ireneus, who\r\nhas more than once proved his courage, is bold enough for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two royal officers contending against a poor country-girl,\" said Alete.\r\n\"We are not fairly matched, and I will go for the claret.\"\r\n\r\nIt was wrong for Alete to leave just then, for the conversation, which\r\nhitherto had been gaily sustained, immediately began to languish, and\r\nassumed a direction which compelled her to silence.\r\n\r\nIreneus complained of the inroad of democratic ideas, of the trembling\r\nand fall of aristocratic institutions, of the authority of right divine,\r\nwhich in his chivalric enthusiasm he looked on as the basis of society.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" replied Eric, with a tone of voice which seemed aroused by a\r\nfeeling of affection, \"this holy authority will lift itself up from the\r\nlevel of the popular waves which threaten to overwhelm it. It will appear\r\nclear and brilliant as our polar star, above the clouds which now\r\nsurround it. It would subsist in all its power, if it were exercised by\r\nmen who comprehended the holy duties it imposed on them. Everything\r\nconnected with this primitive law, with this noble image of patriarchal\r\ngovernment, would yet exist, if each member of the great social family\r\nwould contemplate from a just point of view his own condition, and carry\r\nout the consequences in a Christian-like manner.\r\n\r\n\"Charity, that is to say love and compassion, the two expressions in\r\nwhich are summed up all the joys and miseries of human life, are two\r\nvirtues, ennobling and consoling man. Let the rich man be charitable to\r\nthe servant he has subjected to his will, toward the poor man who begs of\r\nhim. Let him say every day, as he awakes, every night as he prepares\r\nhimself for repose, that the more powerful he has been made by\r\nProvidence, the greater is the obligation he is under to aid and protect\r\nthose around him. In his turn, let the poor man be charitable to the\r\nrich; let him know that no rock of marble, no gilded platform can rescue\r\nthe prince from mortal anxiety, and that human grief is found beneath the\r\nimperial purple as well as wrapped in rags, and that often the noble,\r\nsurrounded by riches and at the festal board, is forced to envy the\r\nhumble hut and obscure repose of the coal-burner.\r\n\r\n\"If ever,\" pursued Eric, with an accent of enthusiasm, \"I shall be called\r\nto expound the word of God, this especially shall be the text of my\r\nsermons: Charity! Charity! By charity I do not mean the habit of\r\nextending the hand, which by a kind of instinctive motion, lets alms fall\r\nin the blind man's basket, nor the graceful action of a lady who at\r\ncertain hours leaves the saloon to visit the garret. True charity\r\nconsists not so much in material aid as in the gifts of the heart; and\r\nevery individual, humble as he may be, may perform a precious act of\r\ncharity. To pay correct esteem to a poor man who has been calumniated;\r\nto revive hope in a mind overpowered by misfortune and tortured by doubt;\r\nto console by kind words a soul mistaken and suffering from errors; each\r\nof these is a charity. To be mild and kind to all who approach you, to be\r\nindulgent to those blinded by the glitter of prosperity, to be kind and\r\naffectionate even when an effort is required to be so, to open a\r\nsympathizing heart to all complainings, to all diseases, to all human\r\nerrors, is the way to gain daily the choicest opportunities of charity.\r\nTo be charitable is to be good. One of your illustrious writers,\r\nBernardin de Saint Pierre, said, 'Were every one to regulate his own\r\nhouse, order would be the law of nature.' We may also say, were each one\r\nto do good, universal happiness would be certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear Eric,\" said Alete, clasping his hand. Then as if she\r\nreproached herself for this emotion, she suddenly withdrew it and said,\r\n\"You need not get into the pulpit to preach a very edifying sermon. You\r\ntreat us already as your future parishioners, and honor my cousin in the\r\nsame manner. Since you have begun, will you not complete his education?\r\nThat beautiful France, the wit and learning of which is so much extolled,\r\nexhibits a haughty disdain of the science of other lands. I am sure my\r\ncousin knows very little of the history of Sweden,--that magnificent\r\nchronicle which in its royal genealogies dates from the deluge. You can\r\nteach him. My learned sister Ebba will also teach him Swedish, the most\r\nbeautiful and harmonious tongue in the world, and certainly the oldest,\r\nsince savans have proven that Adam and Eve spoke it in Paradise. I also\r\nwish to do my duty, and will guide my cousin in the study of natural\r\nhistory of grouse and briar-cock, and the aromatic plants which grow on\r\nour hillsides.\"\r\n\r\n\"You jest,\" said Ireneus, \"but I seriously adopt your proposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! bah!\" cried M. de Vermondans. \"He would be a pretty Captain of\r\nLancers if he were to subject himself to pedagogues, like a school-boy,\r\nand study themes and versions like a college lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my dear uncle, the most unpleasant thing in the world to me\r\nis to be idle. Since circumstances condemn me to inactivity, I would, if\r\npossible, employ my time usefully. I shall be very grateful to Eric and\r\nmy cousins, if they will give me the instruction I need so much. I shall\r\nbe delighted to study the history of Sweden, a language spoken by persons\r\nI love better than any in the world, and the products of the soil of\r\nWhich Alete is the amiable Buffon.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said M. de Vermondans, who, in spite of his eclecticism in\r\npolitics, had, with a strange mental contradiction, preserved in relation\r\nto certain things very deeply rooted ideas, \"So be it. In my time people\r\ntook up no such fancies--more than one _emigre_ passed ten years of his\r\nlife in a foreign country, and never learned to speak its language. The\r\nyoung men of our times are not like those of to-day. The world, which\r\nwhen I knew it was so gay and careless, which from its very recklessness\r\nand its choleric daring was so interesting, now looks to me like a vast\r\nschool. Its atmosphere, formerly impregnated with perfumes, is now\r\nsaturated with the atmosphere of dusty tomes and damp newspapers. We meet\r\nwith no one but persons anxious either to teach or learn. What will\r\nbecome of us if we give way to this pedantic pride? If we surrender to\r\nthis anxiety to analyze everything? If we go on so, to suit us, God will\r\nbe compelled to make a new world, to give occupation to the lofty fancies\r\nof naturalists and physical philosophers, who seem to me to have weighed\r\nand examined this thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! bah! Mademoiselle the philosopher,\" said M. de Vermondans, as he\r\nsaw Ebba smile, \"I am not ignorant that just now I talk very much like a\r\nheretic. You have delighted in reading a multitude of books. I excuse\r\nyou, however, because you never boast of your acquisitions.\r\n\r\n\"You do not belong to those blue-stockings, and I have met many such,\r\nwho, as soon as you approach them, throw at your head the name of a poet\r\nlike a bomb-shell, and exhibit the wealth of their arsenal by firing a\r\nphilosophical cannon, or algebraic chain shot.\r\n\r\n\"May God almighty keep me from those women who forget in this manner the\r\nnatural graces of their sex. Let him protect me from those Laureates who\r\ncan see no natural phenomenon without crying out with stupid\r\nsatisfaction, 'I know the reason.'\r\n\r\n\"Imagine how delighted I should be, if when enjoying the delicious luxury\r\nof sunset, some bachelor of arts should say--\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur, will you suffer me to explain how various clouds assume the\r\ncolors which so vividly impress you, and with what rapidity light comes\r\nto the eye?'\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake let me enjoy in peace all the gifts of Providence,\r\nadmire its works in the innocence of my heart, and discover by what\r\ngeometrical process God has regulated the form of the globe, and to what\r\npallet, to use the painter's phrase, he has ground his colors.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you express a pious and respectable sentiment, which, however,\r\npermit me to say, cannot be admitted without some qualification. We must\r\nnot forget that the greatest gift with which God has endowed man is\r\nintelligence, and that one of our first duties is to attempt to develop\r\nthat intelligence by means of every faculty and all the means of\r\napplication with which he has endowed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. If you were sure that you would not lose yourself amid temptation,\r\nor, if like Tobias, you had an angel to guide you in the stormy voyage\r\nyou undertake. Into what derangement of pride has not man fallen, from\r\nthe fabulous Prometheus, who sought to snatch fire from heaven, to the\r\nPhilosophers of the eighteenth century, who extinguished fire in the\r\nlights of their reason. Prove to me that what you call human reason has\r\nin any manner purified or ennobled the moral sentiment, and I will bow\r\nmyself before your logicians and rhetoricians. To what direction soever I\r\nturn I see only vain puerilities, useless labor, doubtful hypotheses,\r\npresumption and falsehood. I admit that you may count amid the multitude\r\nof books lumbering the shelves of your libraries many innocent and\r\ninstructive works. Those books, however, prove your impotence.\r\n\r\n\"Act as you please, and you will never be able to develop equally the\r\nvarious mental powers. To expand one it is necessary to repress the\r\nothers. By giving your reason the rude aliment of scholastic argument,\r\nyou neglect your imagination. By illuminating your mind you overshadow\r\nyour heart. You congratulate yourself at the discovery of a problem, the\r\nsolution of which you have long sought for. Scientific journals become\r\nfilled with numerous dissertations about it, academies decree crowns and\r\nmedals to the author of the precious discovery. No one remembers, that\r\neach of these solutions breaks one of the wonderful chains of charming\r\nsymbols, of naive ideas which once animated and vivified the people. That\r\nit strips it of poetry, of the emotions of the heart, and the delightful\r\nand fairy-like creations of the imagination.\r\n\r\n\"The ancients were not so learned as we, yet they were wiser. They did\r\nnot explain the phenomena of nature, but described with a graceful and\r\nimposing imagery. The rainbow, reduced in our colleges to a mere\r\nconformation of matter, was the scarf of Iris; the light-footed hours\r\npreceded the car of night, and the rosy-fingered Aurora opened the\r\nhorizon to permit the car of Jove to pass. When the thunder rolled,\r\nJupiter spoke to attentive mortals. When volcanic mountains trembled, the\r\nold Titans sought to throw off the mass of rocks which weighed on them as\r\nan eternal punishment of crime. The middle age, yet more naïve and\r\npoetical, peopled the air, fields, woods, and waters with a crowd of\r\nmysterious beings who spoke to the senses and thought, and awakened in\r\nthe human mind a mild sentiment of faith or healthful fear.\r\n\r\n\"Now, thanks to your haughty reason, we have banished, like idle fancies,\r\nall these creations of our forefathers. Now we know that the air has no\r\nother voice than that of the wind and tempest; that the wood has no\r\nanimals other than those the structure of whom has been minutely\r\ndescribed; that there are no fairies in the green fields, and no\r\ninvisible spirits watching over the hearth and fireside. Man, relying on\r\nhis reason, would be ashamed to suffer himself to be excited by tales of\r\nghosts. He has cast aside all supernatural apprehensions; and I see the\r\ncoming of the time when even Saint Nicholas will not impose on children.\r\nWhat have we gained by thus shaking off the network of smiling and\r\nserious fancies, which both enlivened and restrained our fancy? Are we\r\nhappier, stronger, or better? Alas! for my own part, even were I to pass\r\nfor a mind behind the times, I would confess that I regret those days of\r\ncandid credulity in which each dark forest had its legend, every chapel\r\nits history. One of the reasons why I love the Swedes, amid whom I found\r\na peaceful home, is, that they have not yet sacrificed to the teachings\r\nof modern times their old poetry; and that in the majority of their\r\nwoodland homes are a multitude of popular songs, of traditional faiths,\r\nof domestic customs, which recall the poetic days of the middle age. Is\r\nnot this true, Ebba? You know something of this matter, for you\r\nparticipate in my predilections in relation to them; and more than once\r\nI have seen you listen anxiously to the stories of the old women of\r\nAland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father,\" said Ebba; who had listened with eager sympathy to the\r\nlong dissertation of the old man, while Eric and Ireneus listened\r\nmodestly to all he had said.\r\n\r\n\"When you give me a lesson in Swedish,\" said Ireneus, \"will you be kind\r\nenough to add to it some of those histories, which, I assure you,\r\ninterest me in no small degree?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish it,\" said Ebba, \"I will.\" Whenever she spoke she seemed with\r\ndifficulty to surmount her timidity.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear nephew,\" said M. de Vermondans, with Eric on one side,\r\nEbba on the other, and the practical knowledge of Alete, \"it seems to me\r\nyou can employ your time very profitably; for my own part I can only\r\ninduct you into the mysteries of bear-hunting, and the chase of the stag\r\nand reindeer. It is so rude that I shall not be able to keep up with you.\r\nAmong my people, however, I shall be able to find a guide, who finds game\r\nlike a blood-hound, and follows it like a lion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do wonderfully well, uncle; with so attractive an offer, I\r\nfear only that amid my amusements I shall forget my country and my\r\nregiment, and become faithless to my king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nEven if Ireneus had not willingly accepted the plan worked out for the\r\nEmployment of his leisure in study, the rigorous climate of Sweden would,\r\nin some manner, have made it compulsory for him to do so. To the cold and\r\ndry days, which, during the winter, enlightened and animated the people\r\nof the north, succeeded storms and hurricanes. Tempests of snow floated\r\nin the air, covered the paths, and blocked up the doors of the houses. A\r\ncloudy horizon and black sky seemed to close around every house, like a\r\ngirdle of iron. At a little distance not even a hill could be\r\ndistinguished from a forest; all was, as it were, drowned and overwhelmed\r\nin a misty ocean, in movable columns of snow, which were impetuous, and\r\nirresistible as the sand-whirlpools of the desert. About midday a light\r\npurple tint, like a dying twilight, glittered in somber space: a ray\r\nthrown by the sun across the clouds, gave an uncertain light. All,\r\nhowever, soon became dark again. One might have fancied that the god of\r\nday had retired over-wearied from regions he had in vain attempted to\r\nsubdue. Nowhere does the symbolical dogma of the contests of darkness\r\nand light manifest itself in more characteristic traits than in the\r\nScandinavian mythology; and nowhere does it appear physically under a\r\nmore positive image than in the regions which have been for centuries\r\ndevoted to this mythology. During the summer at the north, the sun reigns\r\nlike an absolute sovereign over nature, and ceaselessly lights it with\r\nhis crown of fire; he ever watches it, like a jealous lover. If he\r\ninclines toward the horizon, if his burning disk disappears behind the\r\npurple mountain brows, he leaves for only a moment those polar regions,\r\nand leaves even then a clearness behind like the dawn. He soon reappears\r\nin his spotless splendor.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, however, he yields to night, which, with her dark cortege,\r\noccupies the northern world. She envelops space with her black wings, and\r\ncasts the ice and snow from her bosom. Sometimes, for weeks, the storms\r\nare so violent, that one cannot, without danger, venture into the fields;\r\nand cruel necessity alone induces the peasant to take the road, either to\r\noffer something for sale in the nearest market, or to gain a few\r\nshillings as a guide to some adventurous traveler. Sometimes, even the\r\npeasants of this country are afraid to cast their nets in the river, and\r\ngulf, which in the greatest degree contribute to their subsistence.\r\nDuring the greater portion of the time, the poor people of the north,\r\nsecluded in their homes by masses of snow, isolated from their neighbors,\r\npass whole winters by the fireside. The men occupy themselves in\r\nrepairing the harness of their horses, in mending the iron work of their\r\ncarriages--for in that country the homes of people are so far from each\r\nother, that each family is forced to provide for its daily wants, and\r\nevery peasant is at once saddler, wagon-maker, and carpenter. Women are\r\nbusy in weaving and spinning. In many provinces, especially in that in\r\nwhich the uncle of Ireneus had established himself, there was in\r\nexistence an _industry_, which, during the last twenty years, has been\r\nmuch developed. Every peasant's house is a perfect workshop, for the\r\nmanufacture of linen. Woofs, white and fine as those of Holland, and\r\nquite as good, are there produced. This variety of work commences after\r\nharvest. In the autumn evenings, women, young girls, &c., assemble at\r\ndifferent houses, with their distaff or bundle of flax, which they place\r\nbefore the hearth. It is pleasant, indeed, to see this collection of\r\nindustrious women, busied in the performance of the task prescribed to\r\nthem, laughing, talking, without sometimes taking time even to listen to\r\nthe young lovers who hover around them.\r\n\r\nOften a respectable grandmother, the fingers of whom were wrinkled by\r\nage, and which neither weave nor spin, would bid the wild troop be\r\nsilent, as she told one of the mad  histories of old times. Then, one of\r\nthe work-women would merrily ring out the peasant songs, the chorus of\r\nwhich her companions would re-echo. After a few hours of toil, a young\r\nman would arise, and give a pleasant signal. All chairs and benches would\r\nat once be removed; the work-shop would be changed into a ball-room. To\r\nsupply the deficiency of an orchestra, one of the spectators defined the\r\nmodulations of a dance by some old traditionary song. Young men and women\r\ntook each other by the hand, and formed together one of those country\r\ngroups which are the elements of the chorographic art. They then parted,\r\nmaking a rendezvous for the next day, for another hearth-side, but for\r\nsimilar amusements. All the work-women, returned to their own houses,\r\nwhere they gaily retailed all the episodes of the evening's events, some\r\nrecording merely a silent glance, which met their own, or a furtive clasp\r\nof the hand which had aroused a blush. More than one happy acquaintance\r\noriginates in one of those northern evenings--and more than one girl,\r\nwho, in the autumn, has a heart free as air, in the spring wears on her\r\nfinger the ring of a promised bride.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather was good, Ebba went out sometimes alone, to be present\r\nat these re-unions. All rose to welcome her with a sentiment of respect\r\nand attention, for she was kind to the poor.\r\n\r\nThe young people silently withdrew, and the matron of the house gave her\r\nthe most pleasant seat by the hearth-side. The children, however, to whom\r\nshe brought every day fruits and presents, leaped and danced around her.\r\nThe old village story-tellers were also glad when she came, for no one\r\nQuestioned them with more kindness, or listened with more attention to\r\ntheir popular tales. Her delicate tournure, her graceful form, her pale\r\nand melancholy look, were in striking contrast with those around her. To\r\nsee her motionless and mute amid the merry girls and the robust young\r\npersons, would have induced a belief that she was one of those\r\nsupernatural beings, one of those fairy inhabitants of woods and\r\nwaters--strange legends about whom she so much delighted in. She entered\r\nand retired silently, and her light feet seemed scarcely to touch the\r\nground. She flitted away like an aerial being, leaving with all those\r\nwhom she visited an indefinable impression, and arousing in some the\r\nvague remembrance of a superstitious being.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when she was about to leave, a woman, who had looked\r\nAttentively at her, said, \"Dear young lady; how feeble and ill she\r\nseems!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said a timid voice, \"one might almost think she had joined in the\r\nelfin dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the elfin dance?\" asked a young man; \"I have seen many, but\r\nnever that.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant you never may,\" said the one to whom he spoke; \"the elves are\r\nwonderful beings, who come we know not whence; and live, we know not how,\r\nin the mountain gorges and woods. Probably they are the descendants of\r\nsome race accursed of God, and sentenced to live on earth, deprived of\r\nevery joy and hope. They never enter towns; do not associate with us; but\r\nwhen they see a solitary wanderer, they seek to win him to them, and\r\nexercise a most unhappy influence over him.\r\n\r\n\"You sometimes have seen large circles of grass in the meadows trampled\r\ndown. They are traced by the elves, as they dance in the summer night\r\nwhen the moon is shining. Wo to the wanderer, wo to the young girl, who\r\nat that time passes near them. The elves invite them to join in the\r\ndance, and sometimes drag them by force away. Into the veins of any one\r\nwho comes within their circle, a secret poison is infused, which makes\r\nhim languish and die. I tell you, I fear that Ebba, good and charitable\r\nas she is, has been surprised by those accursed beings; for she has the\r\npale face and languid air of those who suffer from philtre of the elves.\"\r\n\r\nSitting one morning in the room of her father, Ebba was discharging the\r\ntask she had proposed to herself in jest. She was teaching Ireneus the\r\nelements of the beautiful Swedish language, of the Islandic from which it\r\nis derived, and which has its ulterior origin in the old tongues of\r\nIndia, the cradle of the great Gothic races. \"It is pleasant,\" says\r\nByron, \"to learn a foreign tongue from the eyes and lips of a woman.\"\r\nIreneus enjoyed all the luxury of such a system of instruction.\r\n\r\nWithout having what is called a poetical nature, he was not a little\r\nunder the influence of the poetry of his situation, of the beautiful girl\r\nwho taught him, of her sweet smile, and the affectionate voice which\r\nstimulated his zeal or reproved his mistakes. Any accidental question,\r\nany quotation, a single word often would hurry the young girl's mind to\r\nher favorite theme, the mythology of the north.\r\n\r\nIn her early youth, she had studied the curious dogmas of the old\r\nScandinavians, a singular assemblage of terrible symbols and smiling\r\nimages borrowed from the flowery regions of the east, and of dark\r\nconceptions produced in the cloudy north.\r\n\r\nNot only did she know all the tales, but in some sort she lived in the\r\nmemory of the heroic and religious traditions sung in the solemn\r\ndithyrambics of the Edda, and met with in every page of the Islandic\r\nsagas. Though her heart was always Christian, she was amazed, from time\r\nto time, at hearing herself speak, like a pagan, of the beneficent\r\nBaldus, of Loki, the spirit of evil, and of Freya, the golden tears of\r\nwhom formed the Baltic amber. To her, the world was yet peopled by the\r\nmythological beings, created by the naïve faith of the north, and to them\r\nshe had learned to adapt the phenomena of nature. When she heard the\r\nthunder, she thought of Thor, and his mighty hammer, driving across the\r\nheavens in his iron car. If the sky was clear, she thought the luminous\r\nAlfis lighted up the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn the pantheism of Scandinavian mythology, which, though less seductive,\r\nis less comprehensive than that of the Greeks, all that she heard assumed\r\na mysterious existence. Plants were watered by the foam the horse of\r\nnight shakes on the earth, as he tosses his mane and champs his bit.\r\n\r\nCrows had a prophetic power. The eagle sailing through the air, recalled\r\n to her that deathless bird which sits on the boughs of Ygdrasil, the\r\ntree of the world. A secret spring, hidden amid the woods, seemed to her\r\nthe emblem of that deep spring in which the Nornas spin and cut the\r\nthread of life. To these traditions, far older than Christianity, she\r\nunited the popular legends of the middle age. If night, the whistling of\r\nthe wind, the rattling of the rain, the murmur of the trees, made a\r\nconfused murmur in her ears, she fancied that she heard the barking of\r\ndogs, the sound of horns, and the cry of the wild huntsman sentenced to\r\nwander forever from vale to vale, from mountain to mountain, because he\r\nhad violated a Sabbath or saints' day. If, on some calm day, she looked\r\nat the golden and purple surface of the lake, she fancied that she saw,\r\nin the depth of the water, the spires and roofs of the houses of some\r\ncity which God had punished for impiety, by burying it beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nIf she stood on the banks of a rapid stream, at the foot of a cascade,\r\nshe said that the sounds she heard came from Stromkarl. The Stromkarl has\r\na silver harp, on which he plays wild melodies. If his favor be gained,\r\nby any present, he teaches the listener his songs. Wo, however, to the\r\nman who hears him for the ninth time. He cannot shake off the\r\nsupernatural charm, and becomes a victim to his imprudent temerity.\r\n\r\nOne evening all the family was collected around the earthen stove. Eric\r\nwas there. Suddenly the sky, which in the morning had been dark and\r\ncloudy, was lit up as if by the blaze of a immense conflagration. The\r\naurora-borealis, that wonderful phenomenon of the north, glittered in the\r\nhorizon, and gradually extended its evolutions from the east to the west.\r\nSometimes all the colors of the rainbow were visible, and again it\r\nglittered like a mass of fusees, or transformed itself into a vast white\r\ncloud, sparkling like the milky-way. Again it would assume the most\r\nsplendid blaze, and appear like a mantle of purple and gold. For one\r\nmoment the rays would be alligned, and gradually disappear in the\r\ndistance; then they would cross each other like network. Again they would\r\narrange themselves in bows, dart out with arrowing points, shoot into\r\ntowers and form crowns. It might have been fancied the creation of a\r\nkaleidescope, into which the hand of a magician had cast jets of life,\r\noscillating and floating under every form. At the same time, there was\r\nheard in the air a sound like that accompanying the discharge of\r\nfireworks.\r\n\r\nEric, who had been asked to give an explanation of this phenomenon,\r\nanalyzed the various theories of philosophers on the subject. He\r\nespecially referred to those of the Society of Copenhagen. He said this\r\nwas one of the phenomena which no philosopher had as yet explained; that\r\nof all the hypotheses on the matter, the most specious was that which\r\nascribes the aurora-borealis to the reflection of the northern ices.\r\n\r\n\"My wise daughter, what do you think of it?\" said M. Vermondans, speaking\r\nto Ebba, who, with her hands crossed over her chest with religious\r\nsilence, sat looking at a phenomenon she had witnessed every winter,\r\nand which on every occasion awakened a new emotion.\r\n\r\nEbba said, \"I do not know the dissertations of academies, like Eric.\r\nSince, however, they do not explain the cause and motion of the aurora\r\nborealis, I had rather rely on the simple and religious traditions of an\r\nignorant people, to that of the Greenlanders, who say that the rays of\r\nthe aurora come from the glare of souls which wander over the skies.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my soul,\" said M. Vermondans, \"that idea pleases me. Like the\r\nproblems of the natural philosophers, it does not explain the problem of\r\nthe aurora-borealis, but it is much more poetical. This tradition\r\ncontributes to the assistance of an idea I advanced the other day, on the\r\nvanity of scientific speculations, especially when we compare them with\r\nthe delicious conceptions of the ignorant.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Eric, \"in the infancy of nations, as in the childhood of\r\nthe individual, there is a graceful poetry, an ideal and intellectual\r\nunderstanding of nature, which does not resist grave impressions or the\r\nreason of mature age. Thus, amid the wild nations of North America, the\r\npoor mother who has lost a child, fancies that she scents the perfume of\r\nits breath in the flowers, and hears its sigh in the voices of the birds.\r\nThus is it that our Lapland neighbors attach a touching faith to many\r\nphysical incidents.\r\n\r\n\"When one of them becomes ill, they say that his soul has been called to\r\na better world by the loving beings he has lost; and that his soul is\r\nabout to depart to yield to their prayers, and seek its final home with\r\nthem. Then they send for a sorcerer, who casts himself on his face on the\r\nground, and in mysterious words beseeches the wandering soul to return.\r\nIf it yields to the supplications, if it returns to the tabernacle it has\r\ninhabited, the invalid recovers breath and strength; if not, he dies.\r\nSuch, and a variety of other examples, we find in every direction, in the\r\nwonderful tales of the east, in the popular traditions of the north, and\r\nthey prove clearly enough that there are flowers of poetry and\r\nspring-like perfumes full of inimitable grace in all primitive societies,\r\neven where gross ignorance and coarse usages distress us.\r\n\r\n\"Think you though that science also is without poetry? If you understand\r\nby poetry, what I think you do, every ennobling of thought, every\r\nexaltation of mind, do you think there is no lofty and grand poetry in\r\nthat geology which searches into the bowels of the earth, and exhibits to\r\nyou the different layers of which it is composed, and the revolutions it\r\nhas undergone; in the researches of the naturalist, who exhibits the\r\ncreations of an antediluvian world; in the observations of the\r\nastronomer, who explains the configuration and harmonious movements of\r\nthose luminous orbs removed millions of miles from that on which we\r\ndwell? Do you think there is no poetry in the material development of\r\ncivilized societies, in the industrious activity which digs canals,\r\npierces mountains, subdues the elements, and moves all to man's will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, certainly I experience a very agreeable emotion, when in an old\r\ncustom I find the traces of the religious spirit of our fathers, and\r\nlisten to their legends and songs. This emotion, however, does not\r\nprevent me from thinking of that which should be created by the imposing\r\nspectacle of the progress of civilization, more than the pleasure I would\r\nenjoy if I reposed by the side of a fresh spring, mysteriously concealed\r\namid a forest, would prevent me from loving to look on a majestic river,\r\ndown which floated the canvas of some ship, or the boilers of a steamer.\r\nThe perfection of matters would be to kindle our soul with the lights of\r\nscience, and at the same time preserve the innocent candor of our hearts.\r\nThus will we obey the Bible-text which says, 'You shall not enter the\r\nKingdom of heaven, unless you be as little children.' To be a child in\r\nsimple-heartedness, a man in toil and labor, is the end we should propose\r\nto ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said M. de Vermondans, \"that is a truly noble object. We cannot\r\nhowever expect to attain it. Pride unnoticed, is created by the very\r\nlabor of our minds, and when that poison has inoculated our hearts,\r\nfarewell to innocence. I will agree with you as to the indisputable\r\nbenefits of science. Confess, however, that all the learning of your\r\nphilosophers and mathematicians can I never confer on any people the\r\nprecious customs of the days of old. When we look back on what has been\r\ndone by the would-be wise men of antiquity to ennoble the moral state\r\nof man, I will not speak of the mad ceremonial of the burlesque festivals\r\ninvented by the revolutionists of 1793. They were but scenes of disorder\r\nand frenzy. Imagine, however, the purest and most solemn of the\r\ndiscoveries of science, and compare it with the Christmas festival which\r\nthe Swedish peasant will celebrate in a few days, and tell me which\r\ncontributes to true emotion, to the moral good. Alete, give me my pipe.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words were the usual signal given by the good old man when he\r\nfelt the length of the conversation fatiguing, or felt his favorite ideas\r\nparadoxical, though they sometimes were pressed on by arguments the tenor\r\nof which he found it difficult to resist.\r\n\r\nAlete went to get the long pipe, with its stem of maple-root, and filled\r\nit with tobacco with her own pretty fingers. A sweet smile and a\r\ndeferential look from Eric recompensed her. When he saw M. de Vermondans\r\nseated in his chair, and inhaling the aroma of tobacco through the amber\r\nmouthpiece, he said,\r\n\r\n\"Since you remember our Christmas festival, you will not forget that we\r\nexpect you, Ebba, Alete, and Ireneus to keep it at our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Eric,\" said M. de Vermondans, \"I like your father, and shall be\r\nhappy to pass a day with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Eric,\" said Alete, \"I love your father. Pay however some\r\nattention to old Marguerite's preparations. I wish to be received like a\r\nprincess, and if all the plate is not produced to do me honor, if the\r\ntable be not covered with the finest linen and loaded with delicacies, if\r\nthe furniture does not glitter like glass, and the passage-hall and\r\ncorridor are not bright as if for a wedding, I will turn all the house\r\nupside down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well well,\" said Eric, \"there you are a queen. My father will turn over\r\nall power to you, and you may make as many reforms as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III.\r\n\r\nA few days after the visit of Eric, the groom of M. de Vermondans took\r\nfrom the carriage-house two sleighs, trimmed with wolf and bear-skins,\r\nand harnessed to each of them a spirited horse, the activity of which\r\nseemed enhanced by the cold morning air. In the first sleigh sat M. de\r\nVermondans and Alete; and Ireneus and Ebba entered the second.\r\n\r\n\"Are we ready?\" said the old man, as he took the reins in one hand, and\r\nthe whip in the other.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ireneus, after he had wrapped up the delicate frame confided\r\nto him in a large Astracan-skin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us start.\" The horses, as soon as the reins were loosed, left\r\nthe house at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" said Ebba to Ireneus, \"that you are in Sweden at this\r\nseason, which to us is so solemn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you then celebrate Christmas with so much pomp?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it is celebrated in any country of the world with so much\r\njoy and unanimity, from the northern extremity of the realm to the\r\nsouthern boundary, in town and country, in palace and peasant's hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that in this festival there are touching usages, with which\r\nyou are thoroughly acquainted. I shall be delighted if you will explain\r\nthem to me. All you have told me of your popular legends and\r\nsuperstitions, opens to me, as it were, a new world, in which, I assure\r\nyou, I am glad to wander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I not afraid that I would appear pedantic to you.\" said Ebba, \"I\r\nwould tell you what Eric has told me about our Christmas festival. It\r\nappears to date back to a remote day before the Christian era. At this\r\nseason our pagan ancestors celebrated the winter solstice, just as on the\r\n25th of June they did that of summer. The early name of this festival,\r\nwhich we yet preserve, indicates an astronomical idea. It was called\r\n_Julfest_. (the feast of the wheel,) certainly because the sun, the\r\nevolutions of which are on the 25th December marked by the shortest day,\r\nand June 25th by the longest. Whatever may have been, the primitive\r\nnature of this festival, Christianity gave it an august character. To us\r\nit is not a material symbol, but tho commemoration of the day on which\r\nthe Savior of earth was born in a stable. That day seems to announce glad\r\ntidings to the Swedish peasant, as it did to the shepherds of Bethlehem,\r\nfor each seem to rejoice. The courts and schools have recess, parents and\r\nfriends visit each other, not to discharge the common duty of politeness,\r\nto leave a card with the porter, but to pass whole hours in gayety and\r\nfrank intercourse.\"\r\n\r\nOn all the high and cross-roads, you see sleighs filled with travelers.\r\nOne will contain a daughter married at a distance from home, who at this\r\ntime of universal enjoyment wishes to visit the old hearth-side, The\r\nother contains a son, who comes from the University, or from the city\r\nwhere he is employed, to kiss his mother. The soldier who all the year\r\nhas borne in patience the severity of garrison duty, is satisfied with\r\nhis profession, if he can at that season obtain a leave of absence for a\r\nfew weeks. The sailor returned from a distant voyage, looks anxiously at\r\nthe sea and sky, and increases his zeal and activity, to be enabled to\r\nreach Sweden by Christmas. The houses everywhere are open, and the table\r\nis always spread. All is made scrupulously clean, for at this season,\r\nevery housewife loves to display her order and carefulness. The rich\r\ndisplay damask and rich hangings. The poor strew pine branches on the\r\nfloor, and white curtains newly bleached, deck the windows. You reach the\r\nfamily-hearth. One of the servants takes your horse to the stable,\r\nanother hangs your valise before the fire to dry it. The mistress of the\r\nhouse, while dinner is being prepared, offers you a glass of brandy, or\r\nof beer prepared expressly for Christmas, and called JULÆL. The young\r\nwomen bring you cakes prepared by themselves. Your hands are shaken\r\ncordially, presents are made, it matters not whether trifling or rich,\r\nthey are Christmas remembrances and a pledge of love.\r\n\r\nIn many of the peasants' houses, all the shoes of the family are, as a\r\nsign of this union, placed side by side of each other. In many also\r\nbefore and after meals, a hymn is sung. Then when dinner is over, old\r\nmen, women and children dance together. Servants and masters mingle\r\ntogether, and even the mendicant is kindly received. On that day the\r\nGod of mercy descended to save indiscriminately the rich and the poor,\r\nand to teach the proud and the humble the brotherhood of the Gospel. At\r\nthis season of universal sympathy, even the animals are not forgotten,\r\na larger ration of grain and hay is carried to the stable, and barley is\r\nstrewn on the snow for the birds, who are then unable to glean in the\r\nfields, and who, delighted by this unexpected provender, in their cries\r\nseem to warble forth a Christmas hymn. In some villages the little\r\ntomtegubbar or invisible genii, protecting the household, are yet\r\nremembered, and vases of milk are placed on the floor for them. Other\r\nsuperstitions are also joined to this religious festival. Thus in many\r\npeasant houses, a straw-bed is made on the floor, and on it the children\r\nand servants sleep during the night. On the next day, this bed is taken\r\nto the court-yard, or barn, and it is thought to preserve the fowls from\r\nbirds of prey, and the cattle from disease. This straw is also strewn on\r\nthe fields around fruit trees, which it is thought to make healthy. At\r\nevening, two torches are lit to burn all night; if one of them becomes\r\nextinguished or is burned out before day, it is a sign of trouble, that\r\nduring the course of the year there will be a death in the house. All\r\nfancy that in Christmas a revelation of the future is found. To read this\r\nprophecy however, it is necessary to rise before dawn, to go fasting and\r\nin silence into the wood, without speaking or looking around. If too at\r\nsunrise, the church is reached before the crowing of the cock, the\r\ncoffins of those who will die during the year will be seen, and by\r\nturning the head around, it may be learned if the harvest will be good or\r\nbad, or whether there will be a conflagration in the village.\r\n\r\nWhile Ebba was describing these usages and superstitions of Sweden, the\r\nsleighs passed rapidly along the snow plains, which had been previously\r\nleveled by other vehicles. The spire of the church in which the father\r\nof Eric for thirty years had officiated as PROST with honor and dignity\r\nwas seen. About fifty houses were arranged in a circle around the ascent\r\nof a hill. There was one among them of comparatively large dimensions, of\r\ntwo stories, and built of stone, a rare thing in Sweden, whose country\r\nhouses usually have but one story and an attic, and are built of wood.\r\nOne side of this house adjoined a large and beautiful church, and the\r\nother on an inclosure. Two rows of windows in the principal façade looked\r\nout on the gulf, and before the principal door was a terrace commanding a\r\nmost extensive view. At this moment the sun lit up the polished windows,\r\nand the plain, covered with an immense sheet of snow, shone brilliantly.\r\nThe sea with a fringe of ice close to the shore, rolled in the distance\r\nits free and azure waves, and the forests which appeared here and there\r\nin their somber verdure and mute majesty, the vast and silent space, the\r\nlittle village, the motion of the population of which was already\r\nvisible, presented to Ireneus a picture which differed so much from all\r\nhe had seen, that it filled him with wonder and surprise.\r\n\r\n\"The house,\" said Ebba, \"which I see has attracted your attention, is\r\nthat of Eric's father, a good and venerable old man, the whole of the\r\nlife of whom has been an example of prudence and usefulness. He does\r\nmuch good around him, by means of his religious exhortations and\r\nagricultural industry. In Sweden, many of the clergy act in this double\r\ncapacity. The greater portion of the revenue of many livings consists\r\nentirely of the revenue of the lands with which they are endowed. If the\r\npriest does not take pleasure in rural occupations, he farms out the\r\nlands, and quietly receives the rent. They render important services to\r\nthe districts amid which they live. They are teachers of labor, and often\r\nintroduce systems of agricultural improvement revealed to them by science\r\nor a new machine.\r\n\r\n\"The father of Eric is one of those farmer priests; for more than twenty\r\nyears without neglecting any of his sacerdotal duties, he has cultivated\r\na large farm attached to the presbytery. He has given lessons in\r\nagriculture to the peasants, and enforced them by success, for no fields\r\nare more productive than his own, and no yard has seen fine cattle. How\r\ngreat is his activity!\r\n\r\n\"How often have his people seen him brave, with a vigor they could not\r\nbut admire, the summer's heat and winter's ice. At present the\r\ninfirmities of age render this rude toil impossible. He, however, does\r\nnot cease to correspond with many agricultural societies, and encourage\r\nthose who have recourse to his counsels. He is one of those rare men\r\ngifted with meditative faculties, and with great practical capacity.\"\r\n\r\n\"How pleasant is it.\" said Ireneus, \"to suffer my mind to repose in the\r\nasylum you have opened for it. Since my coming hither I have met with\r\nnone but pure hearts, and have beheld only the mild pictures of a pure\r\nand peaceable existence. How different is it from the agitation of all\r\nparties in my own land! Yet, however, even amid the calm and repose I\r\nhere enjoy, how I regret it. I saw it so great and prosperous, and\r\nthought its destiny so certain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Console yourself, cousin,\" said Ebba, \"you will see that country again,\r\nwhich it is both a necessity and a duty for you to love. You will see it\r\nin that normal condition from which it has by a great crisis been thrown.\r\nMoral diseases, like physical ones, sometimes attack men, and God, to\r\npunish the errors of a people, to abase its pride, strikes it with one of\r\nthese mental contagions, yields it up to the effervescence of its bad\r\nthoughts, until the people humiliates and corrects itself, bending before\r\nthe arm of the Avenger in penitence, and returns to the path from which\r\nit has wandered.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus was amazed to hear her speak thus. The timid young girl seemed\r\nlike a prophetess animated with a mighty inspiration. A flush was on her\r\npale face, and in her glance was the light of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"You are a noble creature,\" said Ireneus, taking her by the hand. The\r\nhand of Ebba lay motionless and pale in his, her blush passed away, and\r\nthe dark shadows of her habitual melancholy returned.\r\n\r\nJust then the sleigh of M. de Vermondans arrived at its destination. Eric\r\nwas waiting for them at the threshold, clasped the hand of his\r\nfather-in-law, and helped Alete out, as Ireneus did as much for Ebba. The\r\nservants took care of the foaming horses.\r\n\r\nThe little party, as soon as they entered the house, could see that the\r\nfaithful Eric had sought to avoid the reproaches of his betrothed. The\r\nentrance of the corridor was so completely washed and dried that one\r\nmight fancy the joiner had just finished the floor. Through the open\r\nkitchen door a large brazier was seen in a glow, and the ringing of\r\nplates and dishes was heard. The antechamber was covered with a woolen\r\ncarpet, and the Christmas pine brought on the day before from the\r\nneighboring forest, decked with garland and moss, rose proudly from a\r\nlarge box, as if it knew how proud a part it played in the festival.\r\n\r\nAs she passed from the antechamber to the drawing-room, Alete paused to\r\nlook at the arrangement of the table. Seeing a false plait in one of the\r\nnapkins, she was probably about to give vent to her epigrams. The door of\r\nthe other room however was opened, and a handsome old man dressed in a\r\nlong frock appeared. His head was covered with a cap of black velvet,\r\nfrom beneath which his white hair escaped. This was Eric's father, and\r\nAlete paid much respect to him.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my daughter,\" said the pastor, as with much kind dignity he kissed\r\nher forehead. \"You too, my friend, and my gentle Ebba (speaking to M. de\r\nVermondans and his other daughter), are welcome. You too, Monsieur,\" said\r\nhe, turning to Ireneus, \"though I have not before had the honor to see\r\nyou, I welcome as a friend. You are all welcome to the hearthside of the\r\npoor priest, and may the festival of to-day be to us a commemoration of\r\nthe past, and a happier tie for the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man took his guests into his own room, in which there was an\r\nInconsiderable library, a few models of utensils for agricultural\r\npurposes, testifying to both his taste and his occupation. He sat on a\r\nsofa, which debility in his limbs made necessary to him, and placed his\r\nguests beside him. Alete, who could not sit quiet long, soon arose and\r\ntook Eric to the window. While, as was the custom with her, she tested\r\nthe patient character of her husband that was to be, the old man\r\nconversed with Ireneus, who from the very first had been attracted by his\r\nvenerable and pleasing face.\r\n\r\n\"From these instruments of labor collected around you, I see,\" said\r\nIreneus, \"that you have contrived a sure method of making your solitude\r\nactive. Ebba has already told me how usefully you employ your time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Usefully,\" replied M. Guldberg, with sincere modesty. \"Alas! let us act\r\nusefully as we may, how much weakness is there in our will, and\r\nforgetfulness in our best resolutions. If by the grace of God we\r\naccomplish any good, what is that in comparison with what we should do. I\r\nlove toil, but I can make no merit of it. In my youth it was a necessity.\r\nThe son of a laborer, who earned with his own hands the money which\r\nsupported me at school, I was compelled, at every risk, to repay him for\r\nhis paternal tenderness by my success. Gradually labor became a habit,\r\nand then a _quasi_ dogma of religion. I thought it my duty, as soon as\r\npossible, to release him from the necessity of sacrifice. I feel myself\r\nattracted by a brotherly sympathy to all who toil. I look with respect on\r\nthe sweaty brow and toil-stained hand. God himself prescribed labor to us\r\nas a law, and his infinite goodness unites with obedience to it the\r\nenjoyment of much happiness. Certainly no person with a heart can repress\r\nsympathy at the sight of the poor laborer, who is busy from morning to\r\nnight to earn his moderate wages, who braves every weather to sow and\r\nharvest his crop. This laborer, however, is often happier than the\r\nmajority of the rich, who, as they pass, look on him with pity. He has\r\ndone his duty. When his task is done he sits contented at his humble\r\nhearth. The sparkling wood, the bread on his table, he has earned\r\nhimself. He educates his child by his own exertions, and as he seeks his\r\nbed, may say he has done his duty. He is ignorant of the troubles which\r\nfill the hearts of the opulent. Ceaseless toil to him is a cuirass\r\nwarding off stormy passions. The door of his soul is shut to dark\r\nchimeras, to the mad fancies which people the area of the palace, and on\r\nhis rude pillow he enjoys a peaceful repose, which the lord of his\r\nvillage often asks for in vain. When I thus praise the efficaciousness of\r\ntoil, I do not speak only of manual labor. The labor of thought is often\r\nmost painful, and its fruits infinitely more valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" said Ireneus, \"you touch a sensitive string of my uncle's\r\nbreast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"Eric has told me of your discussions on this\r\nsubject. I however know my friend M. de Vermondans, and whatever disdain\r\nof science he may affect, I believe he would be distressed if he did not\r\nknow all that he has turned to so good a purpose in life. In attacking in\r\nyour conversations books and writers, he did not tell you how much he had\r\nborrowed from them, and how earnestly he had read them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What books?\" asked M. de Vermondans; \"a few incomplete histories, and\r\nsome odd volumes of philosophy. One must examine closely the reveries of\r\nhuman pride to be able to judge of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Traitor!\" said M. Guldberg, shaking his finger affectionately at his\r\nfriend, \"you not only persist in hypocrisy, but you attack the character\r\nof my library. A few incomplete histories! a few odd volumes! Must I then\r\nrecall to you the admiration with which you looked at my books, and\r\nstudied all that I had collected? Some incomplete histories! a few odd\r\nvolumes! Must I recall to you the delight with which you often have\r\nstudied my collection? Must I defend it against you? Know, that to attack\r\nmy books is to make war against myself. I passed forty years of my life\r\nin collecting them, and to each one is attached some pleasant\r\nremembrance. From some I date my student life, and my entry into the\r\npriesthood. From some I fix the epoch of my marriage, and the various\r\nphases of my existence; some I found in a country cabin, where they were\r\nforgotten; some I brought from Stockholm, where I had been to see my\r\nbishop and an old friend. All therefore recall to me kind teachers,\r\nskillful guides, and are the memorials of different events, which are the\r\ngreat items of my life. Gradually I have collected around me those books\r\nwhich interest me the most. When I am here in my woodland home they are\r\ncompany to me, and the most instructive friends man can meet with. Here\r\nI have the philosophers, who aid me in the examination of the mysteries\r\nof the soul; the historians, who record the revolutions of nations; the\r\ngeologists and natural philosophers, who expound to me the organic laws\r\nof nature; the poets, who sing the joyous or sad emotions of the heart.\r\nWhatever may be my moral disposition, I need only to reach my hand toward\r\none of them to seize on some brilliant intellect, to enlighten,\r\nstrengthen, and console me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How that delights me!\" said Ebba, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said M. de Vermondans, with emphasis, and with an intonation of\r\ngrief entirely contradicted by his face, \"see, this woman has been\r\nbewitched: the poison of your pernicious doctrines has reached the very\r\ninterior of my house. I fancied I would be able to educate my daughter in\r\nthe love of good principles, but I have warmed a very serpent at my\r\nheart. Luckily, I see my faithful Alete attending only to the positive\r\nand who now says that dinner is ready or Christmas-day. Christmas comes\r\nbut once a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner was in truth solemn and splendid, the whole table being loaded\r\nwith enormous dishes.\r\n\r\n\"What a luxuriance of richness!\" said M. de Vermondans. \"Thank God, a\r\nlove of books does not make us forget material things.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus said, \"This is in truth a banquet, with which, in France, a\r\ncandidate for the Chamber might win over many electors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily,\" said the old priest, \"we have no electors here to lead astray.\r\nWhen, though, we leave the table, my farmer-boys will make merry over\r\nwhat we have not eaten, and with them many poor people who on Christmas\r\nare in the habit of coming to the parsonage. You do not to-day dine with\r\nme, but with my people. On Christmas, in Sweden, we make presents to each\r\nother as in France is done on New-Year's day. This game, these fish, have\r\nbeen brought to me by the huntsmen and fishermen of my people. A peasant\r\ngave me a quarter of veal, another gave me cream, a third the butter.\r\nEven one woman has brought me an egg or two, saying that they should be\r\nboiled only for myself. Before long the house will be filled with a\r\ncrowd, and many strange stories will be told around the firesides. Whole\r\npitchers of beer will be emptied to the health of the old pastor and his\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will dance?\" asked Alete.\r\n\r\n\"No, mademoiselle, you will not have that profane amusement. But Nils the\r\nschoolmaster has a very fine voice. Olaf the fisherman, and his brother\r\nChristian, will be there also, and your cousin will be able to hear some\r\nof the popular songs. He never heard anything like them in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Alete; \"one or two rounds with those merry figures would\r\nhowever have been amusing enough. Hark! it seems to me I hear hurras at\r\nNils's arrival. If the two others are come, may I bring him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, my child,\" said the pastor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go, Alete,\" said Ebba, gaily.\r\n\r\nAlete went out, and came in shortly with three young men, who modestly\r\nlooked down, and twirled their hats between their fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, friends,\" said the pastor. \"Alete has told you I had a\r\nfavor to ask. I have a friend here who does not know our old Swedish\r\nsongs, and I rely on you to give him a good idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe three young men looked toward Ireneus and then toward each other.\r\nThen, being encouraged by signs from Ebba, and having drunken a glass of\r\nwine which was offered them, they sang a song which was designated.\r\n\r\nThey sang, one after the other, the romance of Agnete, who was surprised\r\non the shore and borne beneath the water by the amorous _Neck_. That of\r\nfair Carine, the victim of her virtue, the soul of whom flew to heaven in\r\nthe shape of a white dove, where it was again transformed into a joyous\r\nharp, the sweet sounds of which won the crown of queen. Much to his\r\nregret, Ireneus could not understand the sense of these songs, which are,\r\nso to say, idyls and charming dramas. He however listened with\r\nundefinable emotion to those simple and artless melodies, which, in their\r\nexpression of grief and joy, were so pure that they seemed to spring from\r\nthe very heart of the people. He begged Ebba to say to the singers how\r\ndelighted he was, and they then went to the kitchen to tell how pleased\r\nthe Parisian had been.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Alete and Ebba went into the drawing-room, and having\r\ncarefully shut the door, might have been heard going and coming, and\r\ngiving orders, while the pastor entertained his guests. Alete seemed very\r\nbusy. She called the servants--had the position of the furniture\r\nchanged--sometimes talked loudly, and then whispered. Some mysterious\r\nscene occupying the thoughts of Ireneus was taking place there.\r\n\r\nToward evening the mystery was explained. Alete came to take the arm of\r\nthe pastor in triumph, and he, M. de Vermondans, and Ireneus, went toward\r\nthe room. Drapery of many colors covered the wall, and bouquets of moss\r\nand artificial flowers, candelabras reflected from the mirrors, boughs of\r\ntrees, all made the light soft as that which penetrates the forest. On a\r\nlarge table was the Christmas tree, full of lights, and adorned with bows\r\nof ribbon. The pastor had asked Alete to arrange everything as she chose,\r\nand to place in the best possible light the presents intended for his\r\nfriends. With them Alete and Ebba had placed those they intended to make,\r\nand all had been arranged most tastefully. Of the pine branch she had\r\nmade a tree, miraculously bearing silk dresses, portfolios, slippers,\r\nembroidered collars, gold ear-rings, &c. The branches bent beneath the\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nM. de Vermondans gathered a meerschaum mounted with silver: Ireneus\r\nseveral pieces of silk worked by his cousins, and a wooden cup, very\r\nbeautifully carved by an Angermanian peasant. Exclamations were made as\r\nthe different objects were detached from the mystic tree, for Alete had\r\ntaken care to wrap each article with a double and triple envelope, in\r\norder to prolong the expectation of the spectators, and to enjoy their\r\nsurprise. Afterward the servants came in, and also the farmer's boys,\r\nnone of whom were forgotten, and who kissed the hands of the old priest.\r\nThe Christmas tree was stripped of its treasures, and all deserted it, as\r\nbarren and useless. Alas, for human ingratitude!\r\n\r\nThe pastor, taking advantage of a moment when none were looking, went to\r\nthe solitary tree, and took from it a letter with a red seal. Then\r\ncalling his future daughter-in-law, he said, \"Since when, dear Alete,\r\nhave you become so careless of the good things of this world, or so\r\nnegligent, as to abandon the Christmas tree, without ascertaining all\r\nthat hangs from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that I can get anything from it, except a few pieces of\r\nribbon and half-burnt lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so, do you? Well, look here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Alete; \"a letter, with Eric's name on it. This is a surprise\r\nfor him. What is it? That puzzles me. Look, Eric--one day I shall have a\r\nright to open your letters, but now be quick and open this yourself.\"\r\n\r\nEric unsealed the letter; and scarcely had he read it, then casting\r\nhimself at the feet of the old priest, he said--\"Ah, father, how I thank\r\nyou! Then turning to Alete, he said--\r\n\r\n\"It is an appointment by the Bishop of Hernos and of myself as vicar of\r\nthis parish. We waited only for that to be able to marry. Now there is no\r\nobstacle to our happiness. We will live here with my father, near your\r\nown family. May God grant that our hearts may not be disunited. May God\r\ngrant us new pleasures without robbing us of those of the past. Now, when\r\nshall we be married--tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How you go on!\" said Alete. \"Must I, because it has seemed fit to our\r\nvenerable prelate to make you a vicar--(after all it is a sensible\r\nappointment)--put on my wedding dress and go to the altar? Do you know I\r\nexpect a letter from Hernosand or Stockholm! Do you know------\"\r\n\r\nThe artless girl, however, sought in vain to conceal, beneath pretended\r\nlaughter, her deep emotion. She was unable to finish her sentence. She\r\nthrew herself in her father's arms, then into the old priest's, and gave\r\nher hand with dignity to Eric. She said:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever you please, dear Eric, though I am much amazed. I trust you\r\nwill never have occasion to repent having given me your love and honor.\"\r\n\r\nThis episcopal letter the pastor had received on the previous evening,\r\nand he had been courageous enough to keep the secret until Christmas\r\nnight, in order to give it more solemnity. It was now the sole subject of\r\nconversation, and they talked only of preparations for the marriage, and\r\nof the day on which it was to be celebrated. At the instance of Alete he\r\nconsented to prolong the delay, and the wedding was postponed for a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n\"Confess,\" said Alete to Ireneus, \"that you were fortunate in arriving\r\nhere in the middle of winter, when you could witness our dark tempests,\r\nour Christmas festivals, and be present at a Swedish wedding. You will\r\nthen have only to behold our delicious summer nights; and then, when you\r\nreturn to France, you will be able to speak more learnedly of Sweden than\r\nother travelers, who wrote long volumes about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I owe to this country some of the pleasantest hours of my life. I owe to\r\nit a calmness which I cannot any longer find in France. I am indebted to\r\nit for good and healthful emotions. I owe to it, exile as I am, a tender\r\nasylum, a family; and I shall feel your wedding-day one of the happiest\r\nof my life.\"\r\n\r\nOn the very next day all the house of M. de Vermondans was occupied with\r\npreparations for the approaching marriage. Dressmakers were busy, and\r\ncabinet-makers were preparing furniture, platforms, &c., for the\r\nwedding-day.\r\n\r\nAlete had enough to do to watch over the different works. Smiling and\r\nmerry as she used to be, a change had come over her, and she seemed\r\nalready dignified and matronly.\r\n\r\nEbba assisted her with great devotion, and ceased to give Ireneus lessons\r\nin Swedish.\r\n\r\nM. de Vermondans smoked his pipe with an air of thought, and sometimes of\r\nsorrow, for the idea of separation from his daughter weighed heavily on\r\nhim, much as he desired that she should marry so near him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he had reached his uncle's house, Ireneus was\r\nalone. A few days before the merry chat of Alete, the philosophical\r\nconversation of the old gentleman, the dreamy poetry of Ebba, and the\r\nactivity and motion of all the household had diverted the young officer's\r\nattention from himself. Now his thoughts involuntarily returned, in\r\nconsequence of news he had received from his country. His mother, who\r\nshared all his secrets, sought to encourage him, and to unfold a new\r\nhorizon. In spite of this, however, every letter increased his\r\nunhappiness. Some of his friends also wrote to him; and this\r\ncorrespondence surprised him painfully. He heard, in this manner, of\r\npolitical defections which he, in his chivalric exaggeration looked on as\r\nfelony, and at which he was most indignant.\r\n\r\n\"Villains!\" said he, one day, as he read to his uncle a letter which he\r\nhad just received. \"Now, this man owed everything to the kindness of\r\nCharles X., yet for the sake of office he has cast himself at the foot of\r\na new master. Here is one who, on the 28th of July, applauded the\r\nordinances, and swore that the hydra of liberalism should he destroyed:\r\nand said that he would pour out the last drop of his blood in defense of\r\nlegitimacy. He is now a partisan of the revolution. We live in a\r\nscandalous age. All principles of honor and religion are forgotten.\r\nOffice has great value, indeed, when honor and conscience are sacrificed\r\nto it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus, Ireneus strode up and down the room, and crushed the\r\nletter in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"My boy,\" said M. de Vermondans, with his kind philosophy, \"your feeling\r\nsprings from a sentiment which does you honor. Unfortunately, however, it\r\ncan but injure you without benefiting those for whom you have so much\r\nsympathy. To-day is not the first time that man has violated his oath,\r\nand made a traffic of obligation; one need only open a history, and read\r\non every page amid some noble actions, countless base intrigues and\r\nunworthy cowardice. The Roman senate erected statues to monsters it had\r\ndignified with the imperial purple. The middle age, which we are pleased\r\nto look on as an epoch of faith and chivalric devotion, is everywhere\r\nsullied by acts of felony and the consequences of mad ambition.\r\nCivilization, while it corrected the gross errors of rude nations, also\r\nrestrained their virtues. Love of prosperity, the sensations of luxury,\r\nbear to the wall the energetic principles of self-denial. Some\r\nindividuals, who, by their elevated position, attract attention to\r\nthemselves; here and there break a link of the moral chain; others\r\nimitate them, and by fracture after fracture the whole series of austere\r\nideas is interrupted and dislocated. A few of the faithful may attempt to\r\npreserve the remnants, but others look on them with pity, and treat this\r\nreligious faith as an anachronism. The worship of the great is destroyed,\r\nand replaced by that of sensual enjoyments. We do not ask God to give us\r\nthe heavenly manna. We have made another God from which no prophet\r\ncan win us. We prostrate ourselves before the calf of gold. This, dear\r\nIreneus, must be a sad prospect for a heart like yours. That all the\r\nrespect for the past, for religion and misfortune, which exists in your\r\nheart, should rise at the prospect of what you have read to me, I can\r\nwell enough understand. Can you however, repress the wrong which offends\r\nyou? Can the evils of which you complain be prevented? No, do what you\r\nwill, there must ever be men, over whom the passion for power will\r\nexercise vast influence, and this feeling will always induce them to turn\r\nfrom the sinking to the rising star. Even if you go to the depth of a\r\ndesert, to the jungles of an Indian archipelago, to the woods at\r\nCaffraria, to the desert plains of North America, or to the Cordilleras,\r\nyou will not escape from the miserable spectacles of human hypocrisy. The\r\nTurks have a proverb which says, 'Cure the hand you cannot spare.' Now we\r\ncan add to this maxim, 'Cure the hand which can serve you, satisfy your\r\npride, avarice and egotism.' Young and happy when you first entered on\r\nlife, dear Ireneus, you have seen much. A sudden revolution has covered\r\nyour eyes with a cloud, and unexpected treachery has pierced your heart.\r\nTime will show you many others, and if you do not give yourself up to\r\nuseless misanthropy, the most foolish and idle of all maladies, you will\r\nlearn to resign yourself to chagrins you cannot avoid. In your time of\r\ndistress you will draw near to those who do not deceive your esteem. You\r\nwill, without hatred and anger, be able to look at those whom base\r\ncalculation or cowardice has led astray, and if you congratulate yourself\r\nthat you have not followed their example, you will be glad that heaven\r\nhas endowed you with more firmness and a loftier ambition.\"\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of these reasonings touched the heart of Ireneus, but could\r\nnot subdue it. The ardent young man continued to curse those whom he had\r\nseen in the ranks of legitimacy, and who now had linked themselves with\r\nthe revolution. Often, to avoid the remonstrances of his uncle, or not to\r\nannoy him by recrimination, he wandered alone across the desert plains,\r\ncalling all the deserters of the cause he loved by name, and sometimes he\r\neven resolved, like a true knight-errant, to set out and demand an\r\naccount of their crime. When he returned from these solitary walks, his\r\nuncle, thinking that all argument would at such times be useless, said\r\nnothing. Ebba however looked at him with eager sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Alete, for a while, however, diverted him from his moody\r\nthoughts. The pastor and M. de Vermondans wished the marriage to be\r\ncontracted according to the custom of the country. Invitations had\r\nalready been given to many in the neighborhood, to the friends of the\r\npastor and of the two families. At the appointed time, a great number of\r\ncarriages had collected at the house of M. de Vermondans. Beds had been\r\nmade in every room. The house was full of guests, the stable of horses,\r\nnot to remain a few hours, for a wedding in Sweden lasts a whole week. M.\r\nde Vermondans, assisted by Eric and Ireneus, did the honors of the house.\r\nEbba dressed her sister, and this alone was not a trifling task, for in\r\nSweden brides are richly decked, and the daughter of the humblest peasant\r\nborrows or hires jewels to dress her like a lady.\r\n\r\nThe toilet, according to the old usage of the country, was at last\r\nfinished, under the inspection of the matrons of the village. Alete\r\nentered the drawing-room in a dress of rose-colored silk, covered with\r\nflounces, rosettes, a mass of ribbons, etc., and with a girdle, suspended\r\nto which were many ornaments of different devices, all of silver, and\r\nwhich, as she walked, rang like bells. Nothing can be more ungraceful\r\nthan such a dress, which, however, Alete wore with grace. When she\r\nappeared, a cry of admiration escaped from every mouth, and the\r\nspectators' eyes turned involuntarily to Eric to congratulate him.\r\n\r\nAlete took her father's arm to walk to the church, and the guests\r\nfollowed her. At the head of the procession were musicians, playing the\r\nflute and violin; next came about thirty young girls, two by two, in\r\ntheir richest dresses; then the guests and the women and children of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony, the young girls stood on each side of the altar; the\r\nbridegroom advanced to the altar; then the bride was led thither by her\r\nfather, who handed her to Eric, and withdrew a few paces, as if he thus\r\ntransferred to another all his own rights. The old pastor then, with an\r\nearnest voice and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the nuptial\r\nbenediction, and gave his children a touching exhortation. A religious\r\nchant terminated the ceremonies, and the couple left the church amid the\r\nsound of horns and the firing of guns. On their return home, M. de\r\nVermondans, after an old custom, handed each a glass of beer, which they\r\ndrank at the same time, as if to show that thenceforth all was common\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon served. The newly-married people sat side by side under a\r\ncanopy, prepared as if to shelter their happiness. At the end of the\r\nrepast a carpet was spread representing the nuptial bed. The two knelt\r\ntogether, and the company sang a hymn. Then the priest, speaking to the\r\ncompany, invoked every blessing on the couple about to enter a new walk\r\nof life, and bespoke the kind wishes of all their friends. He asked every\r\nguest to give them some token of sympathy, and no one sought to avoid\r\nthis invitation. Each one paid tribute: relations gave the married couple\r\na sum of money; their friends gave them furniture, stuffs, and jewels. In\r\nsimilar cases, at peasants houses, corn, wool, etc., utensils of\r\nhousehold use, are presented, so that often the house of the\r\nnewly-married couple is provided for a long time with provisions in this\r\nmanner. It is however true, that they are dearly purchased by the\r\nhospitality they have to extend for a long time to many guests.\r\n\r\nFrom the house of M. de Vermondans the guests went to that of the Pastor,\r\nwhere similar festivals were gone through with. Alete remained there, and\r\nM. de Vermondans returned with Ebba and Ireneus. As he placed his foot on\r\nthe threshold of the door where he had hitherto always been welcomed by\r\nhis smiling daughter, he was attacked by a sadness which he could not\r\novercome, and went to his room to weep.\r\n\r\nEbba also was sad, for though her character was very different from\r\nAlete's, she loved her sister dearly, and was most unhappy at the idea of\r\na separation.\r\n\r\nIreneus sought to console her.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said the young girl, \"for your kind expressions. I am not\r\nunhappy only on my own account at this separation. My father will never\r\nbe able to use himself to it. Alete was always happy. Joy left our\r\nhousehold with her. I wish I could replace her. Do however what I may, I\r\nnever shall succeed. You and all who know me, are aware that my nature is\r\nof altogether a different character. I am melancholy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentle, Ebba, gentle,\" said Ireneus.\r\n\r\n\"Gentle perhaps, and surely inoffensive, but I repeat melancholy. Why\r\ndoes this sadness continue? Alas, it is the law of God. Do not look at\r\nme, I beg you, as on one of those women whom I have seen and of whom I\r\nhave read, who create imaginary misfortunes for themselves, and deck\r\nthemselves with ideal suffering and melancholy. I have neither sorrow nor\r\npassionate regrets and I do not know the meaning of deception.\r\n\r\n\"My life has passed without storms, but without noise, like the spring\r\nwhich bubbles from the hill. Father and mother have sought to make me\r\nhappy, and no untimely event has interrupted the course of my life.\r\nMelancholy, however, I was born, and will die. That is all.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" added she, fixing on Ireneus a look impressed with\r\nstrange grief and affection. \"Heaven which denied me a brother seemed to\r\nsupply its neglect in yourself. The attachment you evince toward me\r\nappeals to my heart, and I will make you a confession.\r\n\r\n\"When I say nothing has troubled my thoughts, I do not say all. There is\r\none impression which to me has been an event, a circumstance, the\r\ninfluence of which I cannot speak of. I wish, however, to ask you, if you\r\nbelieve in presentiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a question!\" replied Ireneus, \"no one ever addressed me thus\r\nbefore, and I do not know what to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not\"--said Ebba, with as much evidence of surprise, as if she had\r\nsaid you do not believe in the sun or moon. \"I do, and I think this\r\nmatter plain and evident as the existence of God, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor all our faculties. God endows us with that intuition of secret\r\nevents, that species of devotion, sometimes as an act of mercy to prepare\r\nus for a misfortune which will overtake us, sometimes in mercy to point\r\nout to us the consequences of the concealed peril in which we are\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n\"Even you, who seem not to believe in presentiments, have more than once\r\nbeen seized with an involuntary apprehension. This dread, this sadness,\r\nis the antecedent of the tempest. It announces regret, accident, and\r\nunforeseen distress. Nay, I think we thus are informed of dangers which\r\nmenace one we love. I think there is a real link between souls which love\r\neach other, a mysterious tie, an invisible union, so powerful however,\r\nthat how great soever the distance may be, one cannot suffer without the\r\nother being unhappy; I will even say, that I think these bonds exist\r\nbetween the living and the dead, that the chilly grave does not crush all\r\nlove, that the dead are touched by the tears we shed for them, and by the\r\nfidelity of our affections to them. I will not in this connection repeat\r\nto you stories of apparitions, ghost stories, etc. If you do not believe\r\nwhat I say, you will also doubt all popular anecdotes. There are\r\nsentiments which cannot be demonstrated, inductions and revelations which\r\naustere reason rejects, and casts amid the empire of dreams, which exert\r\na great influence over the heart. I saw one night my mother standing at\r\nthe foot of my bed. She died when I was born. She leaned over me and\r\nkissed my forehead. Her lips seemed cold as ice, yet her kiss burned me.\r\nShe looked at me for a moment in silence, and her large blue eyes were\r\nfilled with tears. She then slowly withdrew, and as she did so, opened\r\nher arms to call me to her. Once again, as I opened a door I saw myself,\r\npale as my father used to describe my mother to me, and clad in a\r\nlong, white robe, which fell about me like a shroud. Old people will tell\r\nyou there is no more certain sign of death, and I am sure I shall not\r\nlive long. For that reason I do not attach myself to this world, nor\r\nindulge as others do in reveries about the future.\"\r\n\r\nThis conviction of Ebba was evidently deeply rooted that Ireneus knew not\r\nhow reply to it. He, however, sought to represent to Ebba that these\r\nimpressions should not be taken too seriously to heart, and that at her\r\nage, and with her qualities, she should not anticipate a sacrifice of\r\nexistence, nor give up the joys and hopes of life.\r\n\r\nEbba said nothing. She, however, looked long and moodily at him, clasped\r\nhis hand and left him.\r\n\r\nIreneus was yet more desolate than he had been during the days preceding\r\nAlete's marriage. A letter from one of his friends greatly excited him.\r\nThis friend informed him that the legitimist party was about to attempt\r\nthe reconquest of the realm. The Duchess de Berry had left Scotland, for\r\nMassa, thence she had opened a correspondence with many provinces. La\r\nVendée and the south opened their arms to her, and crowds of devoted\r\nservants had pledged themselves to her.\r\n\r\nAll announced an approaching conflict, and all seemed to promise success.\r\nWill you not, said his enthusiastic correspondent, join in our\r\nenterprise, and share in our glory? I have always known you faithful to\r\nyour principles, and determined to defend them. You will not suffer\r\nyourself to be led astray by a repose which is unworthy of you, and\r\nslumber in peasant life. Shall I write to you some day as the valliant\r\nBeornere did, \"go hang yourself, Crellon, for there was a battle at\r\nArques, and you were away?\"--No, the color under which you first fought\r\nis about to be flung to the wind, and your friends will not expect you in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this news, when he heard the trumpet call, Ireneus felt all\r\nhis military ardor revived. Often in the peaceable days he passed in his\r\nuncle's house, he reproached himself with a happiness to which he did not\r\nthink himself entitled. Now he could not absent himself from the arena,\r\nin which his friends were about to enter; he could not desert them. In\r\nthe ardor of his monarchical sentiments he forgot that this enterprise\r\nwas civil war, in which brothers would be arrayed against each other, and\r\nthe soil of France steeped in the blood of its own children. He only\r\nthought of his oath of allegiance and his banner. His first idea was to\r\ngo. When, however, he reflected more calmly, he thought it his duty to\r\ninform his uncle of his plans, and, under the pretext of hunting,\r\nwandered over the fields with his gun on his shoulder, forming his\r\nschemes and dreaming of the glory that awaited him.\r\n\r\nAn accident delayed the execution of his plans, and at the same time gave\r\nhim an additional excuse for leaving Sweden. M. de Vermondans, who saw\r\nhim come home every night with an empty game bag, said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I must, dear Ireneus, recompense you for your useless wanderings; and I\r\nwill procure you the pleasure of a bear-hunt. There are two young men in\r\nthe village, who will take you to a good place; and, in case of accident,\r\nwill assist you with a sure aim. Shall I send for them?\"\r\n\r\nIreneus, who was anxious to be actively engaged during the few days he\r\nexpected to pass in Sweden, accepted the proposition with eagerness. The\r\ntwo huntsmen, having been sent for, said that they knew the lair of an\r\nold bear they had hunted during the last winter. It was arranged, that on\r\nthe next morning, they should come for Ireneus.\r\n\r\nEbba had heard this conversation with evident uneasiness; but had said\r\nnothing. When the huntsmen left, she said, with an emotion which was\r\nevident in every glance, tone and gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin, bear-hunting here is a very serious affair, and none but the\r\nboldest of the villagers undertake it. When one of these ferocious\r\nanimals is killed, it is borne home in triumph, and the victory is\r\ncelebrated with shouts of joy and traditional ceremonies. He who kills\r\none of these old northern forest-kings, drives a brass nail in the stock\r\nof his gun. Our peasants have various superstitions about the bear. They\r\nwill not pronounce his name aloud for fear of offending him, but style\r\nhim the 'old man' and the 'grandfather.' When they have killed one, they\r\nask forgiveness, and speak kindly to him, and beg him to come with them,\r\nwhere he will he gladly welcomed. All these customs, and many others,\r\nwhich it would be too long to relate, evince the idea of danger attached\r\nto the pursuit of the bear. I do not wish to divert you from a plan, the\r\nvery danger of which, perhaps, pleases you. Be prudent, however, my dear\r\nIreneus, and take care of yourself. I beg you.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with an accent, the tenderness of which the\r\nyoung officer had not previously remarked. He looked at Ebba and saw that\r\nshe was troubled. A loud laugh, an exclamation of M. de Vermondans,\r\ndissipated the vague impression which Ireneus had received.\r\n\"Pardon,\" said the old man, \"women are strange things. If one yielded to\r\ntheir terrors, the front-door would never be passed, and a gun would be\r\nuseless. Because our peasants will not call a bear, should a brave young\r\nfellow hang up his gun, and never venture to pursue the animal? I trust,\r\nIreneus, that you will refute the dreams of this girl by success, and\r\nbring me home tomorrow a fine skin, to make a new hearth-rug of.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus said, \"I have listened to my cousin, but having a sure foot and a\r\nquick eye, I shall be rash enough to wait until the bear reaches the\r\nmuzzle of my gun, or I shall seek him out in his lair.\"\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, on the next day, the young officer, being well armed and\r\nequipped, took the field with his two companions. A servant had arisen to\r\ngive him breakfast. Every one else in the house slept. As, however, he\r\nwas about to leave the house, Ireneus heard a faint noise on the first\r\nstory. He looked up and saw a window. A white figure advanced to the\r\nglass, and then withdrew, as if afraid of being seen. Doubtless this was\r\nEbba. Under other circumstances, Ireneus would have called to bid her\r\nadieu. Since the conversation  of the evening before, however, Ireneus\r\nfelt annoyed, when he thought of her, and left without seeming to have\r\nseen her.\r\n\r\nHis guides led him across hills and ravines to a forest some leagues from\r\nthe village. When they had reached it, there was an eager discussion\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThenceforth they differed about the course to be followed. One wished to\r\ngo directly forward, and the other insisted that a detour should be made.\r\nAfter a long discussion, they resolved to place Ireneus between them, and\r\nadvance in three lines, keeping, however, near enough together to be able\r\nto unite against the enemy. They made Ireneus understand them by signs,\r\nand he assented to their plan. One of them took a bottle of brandy from\r\nhis pouch, and offered it to the young officer, who, _par complaisance_,\r\nplaced it to his lips, and handed it to his companion; he gave it an\r\nembrace, and passed it on to the third, from whom it received equal\r\nattention. Ireneus, who also had brought some provisions, drank a glass\r\nof generous wine to their health.\r\n\r\nThe three huntsmen then entered the forest. The boughs of the pines were\r\nsufficiently far apart not to impede their passage. The ground, however,\r\nwas covered with underwood, and trunks of trees covered with snow on\r\nwhich his foot slipped every minute. After a short time the peasants\r\nslackened their pace, and sought for the tracks of the bear. Ireneus went\r\non, without observing that he was in advance. He soon found that he was\r\nfar ahead, and halted for them. As he looked round for them, he saw\r\nsomething at the foot of a tree.\r\n\r\nIt was the bear, and an immense one. His paws were bent under his body,\r\nhis head was concealed in the snow, and he seemed asleep.\r\n\r\nIreneus rejoiced at this discovery, and recalling what Ebba had said,\r\nsmiled at the idea of acquiring, in the first attempt, the honor so much\r\ndesired in the country, of having a brass nail in the stock of his gun.\r\n\r\nTo make his shot surer, he ascended a little eminence still nearer the\r\nanimal. He cocked his gun, and advanced carefully. The eminence, however,\r\nwas formed only of a mass of leaves and twigs, the interstices being\r\nconcealed by the snow. As he put his foot on it, it gave way, he fell,\r\nand his gun was discharged.\r\n\r\nBefore he could rise the animal was awake, and rushed on him. It placed\r\nits two paws on the shoulder, and having him thus in its power, with its\r\neye sparkling with rage, joked at its victim. Unable to move, Ireneus\r\nclosed his eyes, and commended his soul to the mercy of God.\r\n\r\nThe claws of the animal had already pierced his flesh, when he heard the\r\nreport of a gun both on his right and left. Each had reached the animal's\r\nhead, which fell dead on the meditated victim, covering him with blood,\r\nand lacerating Ireneus's breast and chest in its convulsive agony.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, with a cry of triumph, the two peasants ran to him.\r\nThey found him paralyzed by the weight of the animal, and bathed in\r\nblood. They lifted him up, rubbed his temples with brandy, and holding\r\nhim by the belt, made him take a step or two, to see if he could walk. He\r\ncould do so.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to take him out of the forest, where no assistance could\r\nbe had. With great care, and frequent pauses, they at last reached the\r\nopen country. There the strength of Ireneus completely gave way, his\r\nwounds bleeding, and his limbs failing him. One of his companions took\r\noff his vest, laid it on the ground, and assisted Ireneus to stretch\r\nhimself on it, with touching kindness of heart and solicitude. The other\r\nran toward the high-road, and seeing a car loaded with hay, induced the\r\ndriver by tears, threats and promises to come to Ireneus's aid. They\r\nplaced him in it, and thus went to the village.\r\n\r\nWhen there, one of the hunters sent for his wife, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Go, fast as you can, to M. de Vermondans, and say that his nephew is\r\nll, but in no danger, and hurry back to prepare the table. We have made a\r\nfamous hunt. To-morrow we will have the bear-feast.\"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman, when he heard the news, hurried to his nephew. Then\r\nLooking into the huntsman's face, he passed his hand over Ireneus's body.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing serious, that is good.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after came Ebba, pale and trembling, who, when she saw her cousin's\r\nblood, fell half dead in her father's arms.\r\n\r\nThe physician said that the wounds of the young officer were trifling.\r\nHe, however, enjoined a few days of rest and repose.\r\n\r\nImmediately, on hearing of the accident, Eric and Alete hurried to see\r\nIreneus, evincing  the tenderest sympathy for him. M. de Vermondans, by\r\nhis assiduous care, proved how he loved his nephew. He also gave the two\r\npreservers a munificent reward.\r\n\r\nEbba seemed completely crushed. Her sister found her seated in a chair,\r\nwith her eye fixed, her lips motionless, and her face pale. Completely\r\nwrapped in thought, the young girl did not rouse, except at the sound of\r\nIreneus's name, and when she heard the various reports of the physician.\r\nOften, during the day, she went to the invalid's chamber, passing timidly\r\nup the steps, and placing her ear to the door. She would then to her\r\nfather, and sink again into her morbid sadness.\r\n\r\nOne night, when the nurse who sat with him had seen him sink to sleep and\r\nretired, the young officer awoke under the impression that a delicate\r\nhand was passed lightly over his forehead. He opened his eyes, and saw\r\nthe shadow of a woman flit behind the curtains. It was Ebba, who, unable\r\neven to sleep at night, had furtively come, when she thought no one would\r\nbe aware of it, to be certain that his medicine was prepared, and to look\r\ninto his position.\r\n\r\nThrough the care of the physician and the affectionate friends who\r\nsurrounded him, Ireneus regained his strength.\r\n\r\nThe day he returned to the table was a very festival. M. de Vermondans\r\nhad invited  his daughter, son-in-law, the doctor, and the two huntsmen\r\nto dine with him. The latter brought the skin of the bear they had\r\nkilled, and which they wished to present to their less fortunate\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThey then told gaily all the incidents of that memorable day; and when,\r\nduring the course of conversation, they heard how lightly Ireneus had\r\nconsidered the bear-hunt, one of them said:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I am not surprised at what has happened. One should not trifle with\r\na bear. He is cunning and proud, and understands everything said of him.\r\nIf he is not treated with respect, he takes a cruel revenge. I would not\r\nbe surprised if, having heard what Monsieur said, he laid at the foot of\r\nthe tree expressly to teach him a lesson.\"\r\n\r\nIreneus, to whom Ebba translated this, laughed at the superstition. The\r\nhuntsmen, seeing him laugh, shook their heads, as if to say, \"There is an\r\nimprudent fellow, who will not profit by experience.\"\r\n\r\nAs he regained strength, Ireneus again felt the necessity of action. The\r\nlast letters he received informed him that the legitimist movement had\r\nbecome more serious, the Duchess de Berry preparing to leave Massa. He\r\nalso heard that she had gone successively to the south, and had unfurled\r\nthe white flag in La Vendée. Ireneus resolved to go. When he saw the\r\nconduct of Ebba, her deep distress when he was sick and the joy which\r\nhad burst forth when he recovered, he could not conceal from himself that\r\nshe entertained sentiments toward him which he did not reciprocate. He\r\nloved the young girl, and experienced much pleasure from the\r\ncontemplation of her delicate grace and melancholy beauty. He loved the\r\nsound of her melodious voice. More than once since the discovery he had\r\nmade, he asked himself if he should not look on what had happened as a\r\nsignal interposition of Heaven in his favor. A quiet life, a comfortable\r\nhome, the love of friends and of a pretty woman, certainly deserved some\r\nthanks. He however was soon hurried from this idyllic existence by the\r\nardor of his youth, and the prospect of an adventurous career. To some\r\nmen a peaceable life does not seem existence. They are like certain\r\nbirds, which show themselves only in the tempest.\r\n\r\nIreneus was of this character. When he carefully scrutinized his heart,\r\nhe saw that but a portion of it could belong to Ebba: that with her he\r\nwould constantly be persecuted  by repinings at fate, and would long for\r\nthe excitement of battle and camp. Should he then accept a pure heart\r\nfrom the young girl? Should he deceive her? Honor required him to leave\r\nher.\r\n\r\nM. de Vermondans was painfully surprised when he heard of this\r\ndetermination. He had grown to look on Ireneus as a son, and perhaps, in\r\nthe fondness of his heart, had made a happy dream for the future career\r\nof Ebba and himself. He attempted to persuade him to lay aside the plan,\r\nbut in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, dear Ireneus, that you do not become dazzled by the prestige\r\nof a sentiment, generous and noble it is true, but which may result in\r\nmisfortune to yourself, without benefiting others. How many men thus\r\nneglect their advantages, and attribute the blame to Providence, which\r\nplaces happiness within their grasp, but which they do not see, so\r\ndazzled are they by some imaginary attraction. If this attraction fades\r\naway, they tell how they looked behind; they regret what they have lost\r\nwhen it is too late. Fortune has granted what they wished but neglected\r\nto others.\"\r\n\r\n\"But duty, uncle! duty!\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that I cease to respect that word. Suffer me only to observe,\r\nthat in the ardor of youth one easily mistakes that obligation. There are\r\ncircumstances in which duty appears so clearly and distinctly, and speaks\r\nso loudly, that it must be obeyed at all risks. Our force must be devoted\r\nto it--our soul, our life. Ordinarily, however, we are forced to decide\r\nbetween conflicting duties, and the one which seems the best is\r\nordinarily the least praiseworthy. The man who devotes himself to daily\r\ntoil has family affections, and diffuses good around him. Does not he\r\ndischarge his duty? Does not he occupy an honorable place in the social\r\nsystem? Does virtue exist only in extraordinary actions? Is there no\r\ncrown to be gathered except in adventurous enterprises or in the battle\r\nfield? And is not he a good citizen, who toils usefully, and properly\r\neducates his children?\"\r\n\r\nIreneus did justice to his uncle's arguments, and was moved by the\r\ntouching kindness he evinced. His mind was however made up, and nothing\r\ncould divert him.\r\n\r\nAlete, her husband, and the old pastor, sought to retain him. When Ebba\r\nheard he was about to leave, she said nothing: her head sunk on her\r\nbosom, and tears stole into her eyelids.\r\n\r\nIreneus left not without effort and distress. At sunset the rays of the\r\nsun have singular beauty, and life is never so attractive as to the dying\r\nman. Just at the moment of separation a strange reaction also takes\r\nplace. In an instant we see a kind of dazzling light, unfolding to us\r\nwhat we love and what we abandon. We regret in anticipation what we are\r\nabout to leave. The door is not yet passed, the farewell is not spoken.\r\nWe pause and hesitate. We may return, and joyfully cast ourselves into\r\narms still open to us. This is the last contest of the heart, perhaps the\r\nlast remonstrance of a good genius. Passion however conquers, and the\r\nbark is launched upon a sea without a port, beneath a sky without a star.\r\nMay God guide it!\r\n\r\nThus Ireneus departed, deserting domestic peace, leaving a family in\r\ndistress, and crushing a young heart. He was himself unhappy, but was\r\nsustained by the idea that he hearkened to the voice of honor, and that\r\nthe sacrifice was noble in proportion as it was painful.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of summer. The earth had become green, and the woods\r\nWere filled with the sound of birds. A pure sky, silvery lakes, all the\r\nvaried beauty of the north, seemed revived as if by magic at the first\r\nbreath of spring. Had anything been able to retain him, nature would.\r\n\r\nThanks to the clearness of the nights which permitted him to travel, he\r\nsoon reached Stockholm, where he embarked on the Lubeck steamer, went to\r\nsee his mother, and hurried to La Vendée, where he joined the flag he had\r\ncome so far to stand beneath.\r\n\r\nDuring his voyage, he wrote more than once to his uncle. Three weeks,\r\nhowever, rolled by and they received no news. M. de Vermondans complained\r\nof his silence--Alete sought to excuse him. Ebba suffered in silence.\r\nAfter the departure of her cousin, the delicate young girl had sunken\r\ninto a state of sadness which daily assumed a more dangerous character.\r\nShe loved to sit alone, looking toward the south, as if there lay her\r\nlast hope. She sometimes tried to read, but from her very look it was\r\nplain that her mind was unoccupied. If she saw her father, she sought to\r\nsmile and appear gay to soothe him; as soon, however, as he left, she\r\nbecame prostrate again. Her cheeks grew thin and flushed, she was ill,\r\nand the physicians were sent for--one said she had a slow fever, another\r\nthat she was consumptive. Ebba carefully followed their advice, and did\r\nall that her father and sister recommended. When alone, she shook her\r\nhead as if she thought all remedies in vain.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks passed without a word from Ireneus. What was he about? It was\r\nKnown that he had passed through Paris, and should be in La Vendée. Could\r\nhe not correspond with his friends? Could his letters have been\r\nintercepted? Might he not already have fallen a victim to his chivalric\r\nardor, and be wounded, a prisoner, perhaps dead!\r\n\r\nThe post was looked for with anxiety. The newspapers were read anxiously.\r\nVain hope! those of Sweden gave very meager details of the legitimist\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nAt last M. de Vermondans became angry and humiliated at suffering his\r\nimpatience to become manifest, and forbade Ireneus or La Vendée to be\r\nmentioned. He could not, however, stifle thought in his own mind or in\r\nEbba's.\r\n\r\nOne morning the young girl arose in great distress, and with a feverish\r\nagitation which made her look better. She dressed hastily, and went to\r\nher father's room. She said she wanted to see her sister.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said the old man, deceived by this deceitful animation, and\r\nquivering with joy at the idea of her recovery. \"Do you wish to go? I\r\nwill go with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the stable, had his horse harnessed, and in a few minutes,\r\nseated in his cabriolet, was crossing the fields. On her way, Ebba, with\r\npeculiar tenderness, pointed out various scenes of her childhood and\r\nyouth, the home of old servants, spots where she had been with Alete, and\r\nmade memorable by various little incidents.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she ceased to speak--looked at the scenery with deep interest\r\nglancing at the sea and the sky, and seemed absorbed in a melancholy\r\nreminiscence.\r\n\r\nHer father had listened to her with pleasure, and turned to ask why she\r\nwas silent. He was filled with delight. Had he been able, however, to\r\nlook into her mind, he would have seen a deep sentiment of sadness and\r\nresignation, united with resignation and hopelessness.\r\n\r\nIn the silent meditation of the poor invalid there might be read a last\r\nadieu to the blue wave, the green wood, the distant prospects which so\r\noften had occupied her reverie. The warm summer breeze, which played in\r\nher hair, the clear sky, the whole tapestry of nature she was about to\r\nleave, instinct as it was with poetic fancy. By her half open lips, by\r\nher wondering eye, she bade adieu to the scenes amid which she had lived,\r\nto the flowers which smiled on her as a sister, and where birds sang\r\ntheir matin lays as if she had been one of their kindred.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the parsonage, her father stopped to chat with the old\r\npastor. Ebba took Alete by the hand, and hurried her into the chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Dear sister,\" said she, \"I wished to see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again, Ebba--I hope you will, and for many a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes--but not here, in another world.\" She grew pale as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"What an idea!\" said Alete. \"I was so agreeably surprised by your visit.\r\nHave you come to distress me?\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Alete covered her face, now suffused with tears, with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Alete. I was wrong to give way so. Let us talk of something\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Alete, smiling amid her tears. \"Has anything been heard\r\nof Ireneus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ireneus is--dead!\" said Ebba sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" exclaimed Alete; \"how so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he is. I saw him last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I have sometimes dreamed of a person's death, whom on the next\r\nmorning I met perfectly well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I saw him struck by a ball in the breast, the blood running\r\nfrom the wound, looking staringly around, and smiling in the agonies of\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madness! my dear Ebba,\" said Alete, with a burst of strange unnatural\r\nlaughter, for in spite of herself she was impressed by the words of her\r\nsister. \"Come, Eric and his father expect us. Let us pass our evening\r\nhappily together, and shake off all these presentiments, which I pray to\r\nGod may never be realized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, come,\" and attempting to look gay, she said, \"Madness! we will\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next week, a letter from the mother of Ireneus informed them\r\nthat the young officer had died on the very day of Ebba's dream, of a\r\nwound received at the siege of the Castle of Penissiere.\r\n\r\nEbba soon died, pronouncing the names of her father and sister, who wept\r\nat her bedside. Her last breath uttered one other name, that of Ireneus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS BY THE AUTHOR OF LILLIAN.\r\n\r\nThe following pieces by WINTHROP MACKWORTH PRAED, have never before, we\r\nbelieve, been printed in this country.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF THE TEUFEL-HAUS.\r\n\r\n  The way was lone, and the hour was late,\r\n  And Sir Rudolph was far from his castle gate.\r\n  The night came down, by slow degrees,\r\n  On the river stream, and the forest-trees;\r\n  And by the heat of the heavy air,\r\n  And by the lightning's distant glare,\r\n  And by the rustling of the woods,\r\n  And by the roaring of the floods,\r\n  In half an hour, a man might say,\r\n  The Spirit of Storm would ride that way.\r\n  But little he cared, that stripling pale,\r\n  For the sinking sun, or the rising gale;\r\n  For he, as he rode, was dreaming now,\r\n  Poor youth, of a woman's broken vow,\r\n  Of the cup dashed down, ere the wine was tasted,\r\n  Of eloquent speeches sadly wasted,\r\n  Of a gallant heart all burnt to ashes.\r\n  And the Baron of Katzberg's long mustaches,\r\n  So the earth below, and the heaven above,\r\n  He saw them not;--those dreams of love,\r\n  As some have found, and some will find,\r\n  Make men extremely deaf and blind.\r\n  At last he opened his great blue eyes,\r\n  And looking about in vast surprise,\r\n  Found that his hunter had turned his back,\r\n  An hour ago on the beaten track,\r\n  And now was threading a forest hoar,\r\n  Where steed had never stepped before.\r\n\r\n  \"By Caesar's head,\" Sir Rudolph said,\r\n      \"It were a sorry joke.\r\n  If I to-night should make my bed\r\n      On the turf, beneath an oak!\r\n  Poor Roland reeks from head to hoof;--\r\n      Now, for thy sake, good roan,\r\n  I would we were beneath a roof,\r\n      Were it the foul fiend's own!\"\r\n\r\n  Ere the tongue could rest, ere the lips could close\r\n  The sound of a listener's laughter rose.\r\n  It was not the scream of a merry boy\r\n  When harlequin waves his wand of joy;\r\n  Nor the shout from a serious curate, won\r\n  By a bending bishop's annual pun;\r\n  Nor the roar of a Yorkshire clown;--oh, no!\r\n  It was a gentle laugh, and low;\r\n  Half uttered, perhaps, perhaps, and stifled half,\r\n  A good old-gentlemanly laugh;\r\n  Such as my uncle Peter's are,\r\n  When he tells you his tales of Dr. Parr.\r\n  The rider looked to the left and the right,\r\n  With something of marvel, and more of fright:\r\n  But brighter gleamed his anxious eye,\r\n  When a light shone out from a hill hard by.\r\n  Thither be spurred, as gay and glad\r\n  As Mrs. Maquill's delighted lad,\r\n  When he turns away from the Pleas of the Crown,\r\n  Or flings, with a yawn, old Saunders down,\r\n  And flies, at last, from all the mysteries\r\n  Of Plaintiffs' and Defendants' histories,\r\n  To make himself sublimely neat,\r\n  For Mrs. Camac's in Mansfield Street.\r\n    At a lofty gate Sir Rudolph halted;\r\n  Down from his seat Sir Rudolph vaulted:\r\n  And he blew a blast with might and main,\r\n  On the bugle that hung by an iron chain.\r\n  The sound called up a score of sounds;--\r\n  The screeching of owls, and the baying of hounds,\r\n  The hollow toll of the turret bell,\r\n  The call of the watchful sentinel.\r\n  And a groan at last, like a peal of thunder,\r\n  As the huge old portals rolled asunder,\r\n  And gravely from the castle hall\r\n  Paced forth the white-robed seneschal.\r\n  He stayed not to ask of what degree\r\n  So fair and famished a knight might be;\r\n  But knowing that all untimely question\r\n  Ruffles the temper, and mars the digestion,\r\n  He laid his hand upon the crupper.\r\n  And said,--\"You're just in time for supper.\"\r\n     They led him to the smoking board.\r\n  And placed him next to the castle's lord.\r\n  He looked around with a hurried glance:\r\n  You may ride from the border to fair Penzance,\r\n  And nowhere, but at Epsom Races,\r\n  Find such a group of ruffian faces,\r\n  As thronged that chamber; some were talking\r\n  Of feats of hunting and of hawking,\r\n  And some were drunk, and some were dreaming,\r\n  And some found pleasure in blaspheming.\r\n  He thought, as he gazed on the fearful crew,\r\n  That the lamps that burned on the walls burned blue.\r\n  They brought him a pasty of mighty size,\r\n  To cheer his heart, and to charm his eyes;\r\n  They brought the wine, so rich and old,\r\n  And filled to the brim the cup of gold;\r\n  The knight looked down, and the knight looked up,\r\n  But he carved not the meat, and he drained not the cup.\r\n\r\n  \"Ho ho,\" said his host with angry brow,\r\n      \"I wot our guest is fine;\r\n  Our fare is far too coarse, I trow,\r\n      For such nice taste as thine:\r\n  Yet trust me I have cooked the food,\r\n      And I have filled the can,\r\n  Since I have lived in this old wood,\r\n      For many nobler man.\"--\r\n  \"The savory buck and the ancient cask\r\n      To a weary man are sweet;\r\n  But ere he taste, it is fit he ask\r\n      For a blessing on bowl and meat.\r\n  Let me but pray for a minute's space,\r\n      And bid me pledge ye then;\r\n  I swear to ye, by our Lady's grace,\r\n      I shall eat and drink like ten!\"\r\n\r\n  The lord of the castle in wrath arose,\r\n      He frowned like a fiery dragon;\r\n  Indignantly he blew his nose,\r\n      And overturned the flagon.\r\n  And, \"Away,\" quoth he, \"with the canting priest.\r\n  Who comes uncalled to a midnight feast,\r\n  And breathes through a helmet his holy benison,\r\n  To sour my hock, and spoil my venison!\"\r\n\r\n  That moment all the lights went out;\r\n  And they dragged him forth, that rabble rout,\r\n  With oath, and threat, and foul scurrility,\r\n  And every sort of incivility.\r\n  They barred the gates: and the peal of laughter,\r\n  Sudden and shrill that followed after,\r\n  Died off into a dismal tone,\r\n  Like a parting spirit's painful moan.\r\n  \"I wish,\" said Rudolph, as he stood\r\n  On foot in the deep and silent wood;\r\n  \"I wish, good Roland, rack and stable\r\n  May be kinder to-night than their master's table!\"\r\n\r\n  By this the storm had fleeted by;\r\n    And the moon with a quiet smile looked out\r\n  From the glowing arch of a cloudless sky,\r\n    Flinging her silvery beams about\r\n  On rock, tree, wave, and gladdening all\r\n    With just as miscellaneous bounty,\r\n  As Isabel's, whose sweet smiles fall\r\n    In half an hour on half the county.\r\n  Less wild Sir Rudolph's pathway seemed,\r\n    As he fumed from that discourteous tower;\r\n  Small spots of verdure gaily gleamed\r\n    On either side; and many a flower,\r\n  Lily, and violet, and heart's-ease,\r\n    Grew by the way, a fragrant border;\r\n  And the tangled boughs of the hoary trees\r\n    Were twined in picturesque disorder:\r\n  And there came from the grove, and there came from\r\n       the hill,\r\n    The loveliest sounds he had ever heard,\r\n  The cheerful voice of the dancing rill,\r\n    And the sad, sad song of the lonely bird.\r\n  And at last he stared with wondering eyes,\r\n    As well he might, on a huge pavilion:\r\n  'Twas clothed with stuffs of a hundred dyes,\r\n    Blue, purple, orange, pink, vermilion;\r\n  And there were quaint devices traced\r\n    All round in the Saracenic manner;\r\n  And the top, which gleamed like gold, was graced\r\n    With the drooping folds of a silken banner;\r\n  And on the poles, in silent pride,\r\n    There sat small doves of white enamel;\r\n  And the vail from the entrance was drawn aside,\r\n    And flung on the humps of a silver camel.\r\n  In short it was the sweetest thing\r\n    For a weary youth in a wood to light on:\r\n  And finer far than what a king\r\n    Built up, to prove his taste, at Brighton.\r\n    The gilded gate was all unbarred;\r\n  And, close beside it, for a guard,\r\n  There lay two dwarfs with monstrous noses,\r\n  Both fast asleep upon some roses.\r\n  Sir Rudolph entered; rich and bright\r\n  Was all that met his ravished sight;\r\n  Soft tapestries from far countries brought,\r\n  Rare cabinets with gems inwrought,\r\n  White vases of the finest mould,\r\n  And mirrors set in burnished gold.\r\n  Upon a couch a grayhound slumbered;\r\n  And a small table was encumber'd\r\n  With paintings, and an ivory lute,\r\n  And sweetmeats, and delicious fruit.\r\n  Sir Rudolph lost not time in praising;\r\n  For he, I should have said was gazing,\r\n  In attitude extremely tragic,\r\n  Upon a sight of stranger magic;\r\n  A sight, which, seen at such a season,\r\n  Might well astonish Mistress Reason,\r\n  And scare Dame Wisdom from her fences\r\n  Of rules and maxims, moods and tenses.\r\n  Beneath a crimson canopy\r\n    A lady, passing fair, was lying;\r\n  Deep sleep was on her gentle eye,\r\n    And in her slumber she was sighing\r\n  Bewitching sighs, such sighs as say\r\n    Beneath the moonlight, to a lover,\r\n  Things which the coward tongue by day\r\n    Would not, for all the world, discover:\r\n  She lay like a shape of sculptured stone,\r\n  So pale, so tranquil:--she had thrown,\r\n    For the warm evening's sultriness,\r\n  The broidered coverlet aside\r\n  And nothing was there to deck or hide\r\n    The glory of her loveliness,\r\n  But a scarf of gauze, so light and thin\r\n  You might see beneath the dazzling skin,\r\n  And watch the purple streamlets go\r\n  Through the valleys of white and stainless snow,\r\n  Or here and there a wayward tress\r\n  Which wandered out with vast assurance\r\n  From the pearls that kept the rest in durance,\r\n  And fluttered about, as if 'twould try\r\n  To lure a zephyr from the sky.\r\n  \"Bertha!\"--large drops of anguish came\r\n  On Rudolph's brow, as he breathed that name,--\r\n  \"Oh fair and false one, wake, and fear;\r\n  I, the betrayed, the scorned, am here.\"\r\n  The eye moved not from its dull eclipse,\r\n  The voice came not from the fast-shut lips;\r\n  No matter! well that gazer knew\r\n  The tone of bliss, and the eyes of blue.\r\n    Sir Rudolph hid his burning face\r\n  With both his hands for a minute's space,\r\n  And all his frame in awful fashion\r\n  Was shaken by some sudden passion.\r\n  What guilty fancies o'er him ran?--\r\n    Oh, pity will be slow to guess them;\r\n  And never, save the holy man,\r\n    Did good Sir Rudolph e'er confess them\r\n  But soon his spirit you might deem\r\n  Came forth from the shade, of the fearful dream;\r\n  His cheek, though pale, was calm again.\r\n  And he spoke in peace, though he spoke in pain\r\n    \"Not mine! not mine! now, Mary mother.\r\n  Aid me the sinful hope to smother!\r\n  Not mine, not mine!--I have loved thee long\r\n  Thou hast quitted me with grief and wrong.\r\n  But pure the heart of a knight should be,--\r\n  Sleep on, sleep on, thou art safe for me.\r\n  Yet shalt thou know, by a certain sign,\r\n  Whose lips have been so near to thine,\r\n  Whose eyes have looked upon thy sleep,\r\n  And turned away, and longed to weep,\r\n  Whole heart,--mourn,--madden as it will,--\r\n  Has spared thee, and adored thee, still!\"\r\n    His purple mantle, rich and wide,\r\n  From his neck the trembling youth untied,\r\n  And flung it o'er those dangerous charms,\r\n  The swelling neck, and the rounded arms.\r\n  Once more he looked, once more he sighed;\r\n  And away, away, from the perilous tent,\r\n    Swift as the rush of an eagle's wing,\r\n    Or the flight of a shaft from Tartar string,\r\n  Into the wood Sir Rudolph went:\r\n  Not with more joy the school-boys run\r\n  To the gay green fields, when their task is done;\r\n  Not with more haste the members fly,\r\n  When Hume has caught the Speaker's eye.\r\n    At last the daylight came; and then\r\n  A score or two of serving men,\r\n  Supposing that some sad disaster\r\n  Had happened to their lord and master,\r\n  Went out into the wood, and found him,\r\n  Unhorsed, and with no mantle round him.\r\n  Ere he could tell his tale romantic,\r\n  The leech pronounced him clearly frantic,\r\n  So ordered him at once to bed,\r\n  And clapped a blister on his head.\r\n    Within the sound of the castle-clock\r\n  There stands a huge and rugged rock,\r\n  And I have heard the peasants say,\r\n  That the grieving groom at noon that day\r\n  Found gallant Roland, cold and stiff,\r\n  At the base of the black and beetling cliff.\r\n    Beside the rock there is an oak,\r\n  Tall, blasted by the thunder-stroke,\r\n  And I have heard the peasants say,\r\n  That there Sir Rudolph's mantle lay,\r\n  And coiled in many a deadly wreath\r\n  A venomous serpent slept beneath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTANZAS,\r\nWRITTEN UNDER A DRAWING OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL, CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTED FROM AN ALBUM IN

more dear\r\n   The perfect grandeur of the shrine;\r\n  But if i stood a stranger here,\r\n   The ground were still divine.\r\n\r\n  Some awe the good and wise have felt,\r\n   As reverently their feet have trod\r\n  On any spot where man hath knelt,\r\n   To commune with his God;\r\n  By haunted spring, or fairy well,\r\n   Beneath the ruined convent's gloom,\r\n  Beside the feeble hermit's cell,\r\n   Or the false prophet's tomb.\r\n\r\n  But when was high devotion graced\r\n   With lovelier dwelling, loftier throne,\r\n  Than thus the limner's art hath traced\r\n   From the time-honored stone?\r\n  The spirit here of worship seems\r\n   To hold the heart in wondrous thrall,\r\n  And heavenward hopes and holy dreams,\r\n   Came at her voiceless call;--\r\n\r\n  At midnight, when the lonely moon\r\n   Looks from a vapor's silvery fold;\r\n  Or morning, when the sun of June\r\n   Crests the high towers with gold;\r\n  For every change of hour and form\r\n   Makes that fair scene more deeply fair;\r\n  And dusk and day-break, calm and storm,\r\n   Are all religion there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  A FRAGMENT OF A BALLAD:\r\n\r\n  TEACHING HOW POETRY IS BEST PAID FOR.\r\n\r\n  Non voglio cento scudi.--Song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oh say not that the minstrel's art,\r\n    The pleasant gift of verse,\r\n  Though his hopes decay, though his friends depart,\r\n    Can ever be a curse;--\r\n  Though sorrow reign within his heart,\r\n    And Penury hold his purse.\r\n\r\n  Say not his toil is profitless;--\r\n    Though he charm no rich relation,\r\n  The Fairies all his labors bless\r\n    With such remuneration,\r\n  As Mr. Hume would soon confess\r\n    Beyond his calculation.\r\n\r\n  Annuities, and three per cents,\r\n    Little cares he about them;\r\n  And India bonds, and tithes, and rents,\r\n    He rambles on without them:\r\n  But love, and noble sentiments,--\r\n    Oh, never bid him doubt them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Young Florice rose from his humble bed,\r\n    And prayed as a good youth should;\r\n  And forth he sped, with a lightsome tread,\r\n    Into the neighboring wood;\r\n  He knew where the berries were ripe and red,\r\n    And where the old oak stood.\r\n\r\n  And as he lay, at the noon of day,\r\n    Beneath the ancient tree,\r\n  A grayhaired pilgrim passed that way;\r\n    A holy man was he,\r\n  And he was wending forth to pray\r\n    At a shrine in a far countrie.\r\n\r\n  Oh, his was a weary wandering,\r\n    And a song or two might cheer him.\r\n  The pious youth began to sing,\r\n    As the ancient man drew near him;\r\n  The lark was mute as he touched the string,\r\n    And the thrush said, \"Hear him, hear him!\"\r\n\r\n  He sand high tales of the martyred brave;\r\n    Of the good, and pure, and just;\r\n  Who have gone into the silent grave,\r\n    In such deep faith and trust,\r\n  That the hopes and thoughts which sain and save\r\n    Spring from their buried dust.\r\n\r\n  The fair of face, and the stout of limb,\r\n    Meek maids, and grandsires hoary;\r\n  Who have sung on the cross their rapturous hymn,\r\n    As they passed to their doom of glory;--\r\n  Their radiant fame is never dim,\r\n    Nor their names erased from story.\r\n\r\n  Time spares the stone where sleep the dead\r\n    With angels watching round them;\r\n  The mourner's grief is comforted,\r\n     As he looks on the chains that bound them;\r\n  And peace is shed on the murderer's head,\r\n    And he kisses the thorns that crowned them.\r\n\r\n  Such tales he told; and the pilgrim heard\r\n    In a trance of voiceless pleasure;\r\n  For the depths of his inmost soul were stirred,\r\n    By the sad and solemn measure:\r\n  \"I give thee my blessing,\"--was his word;\r\n    \"It is all I have of treasure!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A little child came bounding by;\r\n    And he, in a fragrant bower,\r\n  Had found a gorgeous butterfly,\r\n    Rare spoil for a nursery dower,\r\n  Which, with fierce step, and eager eye,\r\n    He chased from flower to flower.\r\n\r\n  \"Come hither, come hither,\" 'gan Florice call;\r\n    And the urchin left his fun;\r\n  So from the hall of poor Sir Paul\r\n     Retreats the baffled dun;\r\n  So Ellen parts from the village ball,\r\n    Where she leaves a heart half won\r\n\r\n  Then Florice did the child caress,\r\n    And sang his sweetest songs:\r\n  Their theme was of the gentleness,\r\n    Which to the soul belongs,\r\n  Ere yet it knows the name or dress\r\n    Of human rights and wrongs.\r\n\r\n  And of the wants which make agree\r\n    All parts of this vast plan;\r\n  How life is in whate'er we see,\r\n    And only life in man:--\r\n  What matter where the less may be,\r\n    And where the longer span?\r\n\r\nAn  d how the heart grows hard without\r\n    Soft Pity's freshing dews;\r\n  And how when any life goes out\r\n    Some little pang ensues;--\r\n  Facts which great soldiers often doubt,\r\n    And wits who write reviews.\r\n\r\n  Oh, Song hath power o'er Nature's springs\r\n    Though deep the Nymph has laid them!\r\n  The child gazed, gazed, on the gilded wings,\r\n    As the next light breeze displayed them;\r\n  But he felt the while that the meanest things\r\n    Are dear to him that made them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The sun went down behind the hill,\r\n    The breeze was growing colder\r\n  But there the minstrel lingered still;\r\n    And amazed the chance beholder,\r\n  Musing beside a rippling rill,\r\n    With a harp upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n  And soon, on a graceful steed and tame,\r\n    A sleek Arabian mare,\r\n  The Lady Juliana came,\r\n    Riding to take the air,\r\n  With Lords of fame, at whose proud name\r\n    A radical would swear.\r\n\r\n  The minstrel touched his lute again.--\r\n    It was more than a Sultan's crown,\r\n  When the lady checked her bridle rein,\r\n    And lit from her palfrey down:--\r\n  What would you give for such a strain,\r\n    Rees, Longman, Orme, and Brown?\r\n\r\n  He sang of Beauty's dazzling eyes,\r\n    Of Beauty's melting tone;\r\n  And how her praise is a richer prize\r\n    Then the gems of Persia's throne:\r\n  And her love a bliss which the coldly wise\r\n    Have never, never, known.\r\n  He told how the valiant scoff at fear,\r\n    When the sob of her grief is heard;\r\n  How they couch the spear for a smile or tear\r\n    How they die for a single word;--\r\n  Things which, I own, to me appear\r\n    Exceedingly absurd.\r\n\r\n  The Lady soon had heard enough:\r\n    She turned to hear Sir Denys\r\n  Discourse, in language vastly gruff,\r\n    About his skill at Tennis--\r\n  While smooth Sir Guy described the stuff\r\n    His mistress wore at Venice.\r\n\r\n  The Lady smiled one radiant smile,\r\n    And the Lady rode away.--\r\n  There is not a lady in all our Isle,\r\n    I have heard a Poet say,\r\n  Who can listen more than a little while\r\n    To a poet's sweetest lay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  His mother's voice was fierce and shrill,\r\n    As she set the milk and fruit:\r\n  \"Out on thine unrewarded skill,\r\n    And on thy vagrant lute;\r\n  Let the strings be broken an they will,\r\n    And the beggar lips be mute!\"\r\n\r\n  Peace, peace!--the Pilgrim as he went\r\n    Forgot the minstrel's song;\r\n  But the blessing that his wan lips sent\r\n    Will guard the minstrel long;\r\n  And keep his spirit innocent,\r\n    And turn his hand from wrong.\r\n\r\n  Belike the child had little thought\r\n    Of the moral the minstrel drew;\r\n  But the dream of a deed of kindness wrought--\r\n    Brings it not peace to you?\r\n  And doth not a lesson of virture taught\r\n    Teach him that reaches too?\r\n\r\n  And if the Lady sighed no sigh\r\n    For the minstrel or his hymn;--\r\n  But when he shall lie 'neath the moonlit sky,\r\n    Or lip the goblet's brim,\r\n  What a star in the mist of memory\r\n    Her smile will be to him!\r\n\r\n       *       *

o'er the cottage roof;\r\n    Judge not for those to-day!\r\n\r\n    Is not thine own dread rod\r\n  Mocked by the proud, thy holy book disdained,\r\n  Thy name blasphemed, thy temple's courts

hurl their Dagon down!\r\n\r\n    Come in thine own good time!\r\n  We will abide: we have not turned from thee;\r\n  Though in a world of grief our portion be,\r\n    Of bitter grief, and crime.\r\n\r\n    Be thou our guard and guide!\r\n  Forth from the spoiler's synagogue we go.\r\n  That we may worship where the torrents flow,\r\n    And where the whirlwinds ride.\r\n\r\n    From lonely rocks and caves\r\n  We will pour forth our sacrifice of prayer.--\r\n  On, brethren, to the mountains!

treasure,\r\n  I saw, dear Susan, Love and Hope\r\n    Set out in search of Pleasure:\r\n  All mirth and smiles I saw them go;\r\n    Each was the other's banker;\r\n  For Hope took up her brother's bow,\r\n    And Love, his sister's anchor.\r\n\r\n  They rambled on o'er vale and hill,\r\n    They passed by cot and tower;\r\n  Through summer's glow and winter's chill,\r\n    Through sunshine and through shower,\r\n  But what did those fond playmates care\r\n    For climate, or for weather?\r\n  All scenes to them were bright and fair,\r\n    On which they gazed together.\r\n\r\n  Sometimes they turned aside to bless\r\n    Some Muse and her wild numbers,\r\n  Or breathe a dream of holiness\r\n    On Beauty's quiet slumbers;\r\n  \"Fly on,\" said Wisdom, with cold sneers:\r\n    \"I teach my friends to doubt you;\"\r\n  \"Come back,\" said Age, with bitter tears,\r\n    \"My heart is cold without you.\"\r\n\r\n  When Poverty beset their path,\r\n    And threatened to divide them,\r\n  They coaxed away the beldame's wrath,\r\n    Ere she had breath to chide them,\r\n  By vowing all her rags were silk,\r\n    And all her bitters, honey,\r\n  And showing taste for bread and milk,\r\n    And utter scorn of money.\r\n\r\n  They met stern Danger in their way,\r\n    Upon a ruin seated;\r\n  Before him kings had quaked that day,\r\n    And armies had retreated:\r\n  But he was robed in such a cloud,\r\n    As Love and Hope came near him,\r\n  That though he thundered long and loud,\r\n    They did not see or hear him.\r\n\r\n  A gray-beard joined them, Time by name;\r\n    And Love was nearly crazy,\r\n  To find that he was very lame,\r\n    And also very lazy:\r\n  Hope, as he listened to her tale,\r\n    Tied wings upon his jacket;\r\n  And then they far outran the mail,\r\n    And far outsailed the packet.\r\n\r\n  And so, when they had safely passed\r\n    O'er many a land and billow,\r\n  Before a grave they stopped at last,\r\n    Beneath a weeping willow:\r\n  The moon upon the humble mound\r\n    Her softest light was flinging;\r\nSad nightingales were singing.\r\n\r\n  \"I leave you here,\" quoth Father Time,\r\n    As hoarse as any raven;\r\n  And Love kneeled down to spell the rhyme\r\n    Upon the rude stone graven:\r\n  But Hope looked onward, calmly brave;\r\n    And whispered, \"Dearest brother,\r\n  We're parted on this side the grave,--\r\n    We'll meet upon the other.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRIVATE THEATRICALS.\r\n\r\nLADY ARABELLA FUSTIAN TO LORD CLARENCE FUSTIAN.\r\n\r\n

there never was seen a\r\n    Performer, so like the O'Neill.\r\n  At rehearsals, her exquisite fancy\r\n    Has deeply affected us all;\r\n  For one tear that trickles at Drury,\r\n    There'll be twenty at Fustian Hall.\r\n\r\n  Dread objects are scattered before her,\r\n    On purpose to harrow her soul;\r\n  She stares, till a deep spell comes o'er her,\r\n    At a knife, or a cross, or a bowl.\r\n  The sword never seems to alarm her,\r\n    That hangs on a peg to the wall,\r\n  And she doats on thy rusty old armor\r\n    Lord Fustian, of Fustian Hall.\r\n\r\n  She stabbed a bright mirror this morning,--\r\n    Poor Kitty was quite out of breath,--\r\n  And trampled, in anger and scorning,\r\n    A bonnet and feathers to death.\r\n  But hark,--I've a part in the Stranger,--\r\n

It\r\nExtended from the Norman Conquest to the present century. His first known\r\nancestor came over with William, and must have been a man of some mark,\r\neither of bone and sinew, or of brain, for he obtained what the Americans\r\nwould call a prime location. As his name does not occur in the Roll of\r\nBattle Abbey, he was, of course, not of a very high Norman extraction;\r\nbut he had done enough, it seems, in the way of knocking down Saxons, to\r\nplace himself on a considerable eminence in this kingdom. The center of\r\nhis domains was conspicuous far over the country, through a high range of\r\nrock overhanging one of the sweetest rivers in England. On one hand lay a\r\nvast tract of rich marsh land, capable, as society advanced, of being\r\nconverted into meadows; and on the other, as extensive moorlands, finely\r\nundulating, and abounding with woods and deer.\r\n\r\nHere the original Sir Roger built his castle on the summit of the range\r\nof rock, with huts for his followers; and became known directly all over\r\nthe country as Sir Roger de Rockville, or Sir Roger of the hamlet on the\r\nRock. Sir Roger, no doubt, was a mighty hunter before the lord of the\r\nfeudal district: it is certain that his descendants were. For generations\r\nthey led a jolly life at Rockville, and were always ready to exchange the\r\nexcitement of the chase for a bit of civil war. Without that the country\r\nwould have grown dull, and ale and venison lost their flavor. There was\r\nno gay London in those days, and a good brisk skirmish with their\r\nneighbors in helm and hauberk was the way of spending their season. It\r\nwas their parliamentary debate, and was necessary to thin their woods.\r\nProtection and Free Trade were as much the great topics of interest as\r\nthey are now, only they did not trouble themselves so much about Corn\r\nbills. Their bills were of good steel, and their protective measures were\r\narrows a cloth-yard long. Protection meant a good suit of mail; and a\r\ncastle with its duly prescribed moats, bastions, portcullises, and donjon\r\nkeep. Free Trade was a lively inroad into the neighboring baron's lands,\r\nand the iportation thence of goodly herds and flocks. Foreign cattle for\r\nhome consumption was as _sticking an article_ in their markets as in\r\nours, only the blows were expended on one another's heads, instead of the\r\nheads of foreign bullocks--that is, bullocks from over the Welch or\r\nScotch marches, as from beyond the next brook.\r\n\r\nThus lived the Rockvilles for ages. In all the iron combats of those iron\r\ntimes they took care to have their quota. Whether it were Stephen against\r\nMatilda, or Richard against his father, or John against the barons;\r\nwhether it were York or Lancaster, or Tudor or Stuart, the Rockvilles\r\nwere to be found in the _mêlée_, and winning power and lands. So long as\r\nit required only stalwart frames and stout blows, no family cut a more\r\nconspicuous figure. The Rockvilles were at Bosworth Field. The Rockvilles\r\nfought in Ireland under Elizabeth. The Rockvilles were staunch defenders\r\nof the cause in the war of Charles I. with his Parliament. The Rockvilles\r\neven fought for James II. at the Boyne, when three-fourths of the most\r\nloyal of the English nobility and gentry had deserted him in disgust and\r\nindignation. But from that hour they had been less conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the successful party, that of William of Orange, of\r\ncourse brought them into disgrace: and though they were never molested on\r\nthat account, they retired to their estate, and found it convenient to be\r\nas unobtrusive as possible. Thenceforward you heard no more of the\r\nRockvilles in the national annals. They became only of consequence in\r\ntheir own district. They acted as magistrates. They served as high\r\nsheriffs. They were a substantial county family, and nothing more.\r\nEducation and civilization advanced; a wider and very different field of\r\naction and ambition opened upon the aristocracy of England. Our fleets\r\nand armies abroad, our legislature at home, law and the church, presented\r\nbrilliant paths to the ambition of those thirsting for distinction, and\r\nthe good things that follow it. But somehow the Rockvilles did not expand\r\nwith this expansion. So long as it required only a figure of six feet\r\nhigh, broad shoulders, and a strong arm, they were a great and\r\nconspicuous race. But when the head became the member most in request,\r\nthey ceased to go a-head. Younger sons, it is true, served in army and in\r\nnavy, and filled the family pulpit, but they produced no generals, no\r\nadmirals, no archbishops. The Rockvilles of Rockville were very\r\nconservative, very exclusive, and very stereotype. Other families grew\r\npoor, and enriched themselves again by marrying plebeian heiresses. New\r\nfamilies grew up out of plebeian blood into greatness, and intermingled\r\nthe vigor of their fresh earth with the attenuated aristocratic soil. Men\r\nof family became great lawyers, great statesmen, great prelates and even\r\ngreat poets and philosophers. The Rockvilles remained high, proud,\r\nbigoted, and _borné_.\r\n\r\nThe Rockvilles married Rockvilles, or their first cousins, the\r\nCesgvilles, simply to prevent property going out of the family. They kept\r\nthe property together. They did not lose an acre, and they were a fine,\r\ntall, solemn race--and nothing more. What ailed them?\r\n\r\nIf you saw Sir Roger Rockville,--for there was an eternal Sir Roger\r\nfilling his office of high sheriff,--he had a very fine carriage, and a\r\nvery fine retinue in the most approved and splendid antique costumes; if\r\nyou saw him sitting on the bench at quarter sessions, he was a tall,\r\nstately, and solemn man. If you saw Lady Rockville shopping, in her\r\nhandsome carriage, with very handsomely attired servants; saw her at the\r\ncounty ball, or on the race-stand, she was a tall, aristocratic, and\r\nstately lady. That was in the last generation--the present could boast of\r\nno Lady Rockville.\r\n\r\nGreat outward respect was shown to the Rockvilles on account of the\r\nlength of their descent, and the breadth of their acres. They were\r\nalways, when any stranger asked about them, declared, with a serious and\r\nimportant air, to be a very ancient, honorable, and substantial family.\r\n\"Oh! a great family are the Rockvilles, a very great family.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you came to close quarters with the members of this great and\r\nhighly distinguished family, you soon found yourself fundamentally\r\nastonished: you had a sensation come over you, as if you were trying,\r\nlike Moses, to draw water from a rock, without his delegated power. There\r\nwas a goodly outside of things before you, but nothing came of it. You\r\ntalked, hoping to get talking in return, but you got little more than\r\n\"noes\" and \"yeses,\" and \"oh! indeeds!\" and \"reallys,\" and sometimes not\r\neven that, but a certain look of aristocratic dignity or dignification,\r\nthat was meant to serve for all answers. There was a sort of resting on\r\naristocratic oars or \"sculls,\" that were not to be too vulgarly handled.\r\nThere was a feeling impressed on you, that eight-hundred years of descent\r\nand ten thousand a-year in landed income did not trouble themselves with\r\nthe trifling things that gave distinction to lesser people--such as\r\nliterature, fine arts, politics, and general knowledge. These were very\r\nwell for those who had nothing else to pride themselves on, but for the\r\nRockvilles--oh! certainly they were by no means requisite.\r\n\r\nIn fact, you found yourself, with a little variation, in the predicament\r\nof Cowper's people,\r\n\r\n                      --who spent their lives\r\n  In dropping buckets into empty wells,\r\n  And _growing tired_ of drawing nothing up.\r\n\r\nWho hasn't often come across these \"dry wells\" of society; solemn gulfs\r\nout of which you can pump nothing up? You know them; they are at your\r\nelbow every day in large and brilliant companies, and defy the best\r\nsucking-buckets ever invented to extract anything from them. But the\r\nRockvilles were each and all of this adust description. It was a family\r\nfeature, and they seemed, if either, rather proud of it. They must be so;\r\nfor proud they were, amazingly proud; and they had nothing besides to be\r\nproud of, except  their acres, and their ancestors.\r\n\r\nBut the fact was, they could not help it. It was become organic. They had\r\nacted the justice of peace, maintained the constitution against upstarts\r\nand manufacturers, signed warrants, supported the church and the house of\r\ncorrection, committed poachers, and then rested on the dignity of their\r\nancestors for so many generations, that their skulls, brains,\r\nconstitutions, and nervous systems, were all so completely moulded into\r\nthat shape and baked into that mould, that a Rockville would be a\r\nRockville to the end of time, if God and Nature would have allowed it.\r\nBut such things wear out. The American Indians and the Australian nations\r\nwear out; they are not progressive, and as Nature abhors a vacuum, she\r\ndoes not forget the vacuum wherever it may be, whether in a hot desert,\r\nor in a cold and stately Rockville;--a very ancient, honorable, and\r\nsubstantial family that lies fallow till the thinking faculty literally\r\ndies out.\r\n\r\nFor several generations there had been symptoms of decay about the\r\nRockville family. Not in its property, that was as large as ever; not in\r\ntheir personal stature and physical aspect. The Rockvilles continued, as\r\nthey always had been, a tall and not bad-looking family. But they grew\r\ngradually less prolific. For a hundred and fifty years past there had\r\nseldom been more than two, or at most three, children. There had\r\ngenerally been an heir to the estate, and another to the family pulpit,\r\nand sometimes a daughter married to some neighboring squire. But Sir\r\nRoger's father had been an only child, and Sir Roger himself was an only\r\nchild. The danger of extinction to the family, apparent as it was, had\r\nnever induced Sir Roger to marry. At the time that we are turning our\r\nattention upon him, he had reached the mature age of sixty. Nobody\r\nbelieved that Sir Roger now would marry; he was the last, and likely to\r\nbe, of his line.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while here to take a glance at Sir Roger and his estate. They\r\nwore a strange contrast. The one bore all the signs of progress, the\r\nother of a stereotyped feudality. The estate, which in the days of the\r\nfirst Sir Roger de Rockville had been half morass and half wilderness,\r\nwas now cultivated to the pitch of British agricultural science. The\r\nmarshlands beyond the river were one splendid expanse of richest meadows,\r\nyielding a rental of four solid pounds per acre. Over hill and dale on\r\nthis side for miles, where formerly ran wild deer, and grew wild\r\nwoodlands of furze-bushes, now lay excellent farms and hamlets, and along\r\nthe ridge of the ancient cliffs rose the most magnificent woods. Woods,\r\ntoo, clothed the steep hillsides, and swept down to the noble river,\r\ntheir very boughs hanging far out over its clear and rapid waters. In the\r\nmidst of these fine woods stood Rockville Hall, the family seat of the\r\nRockvilles. It reared its old brick walls above the towering mass of\r\nelms, and travelers at a distance recognized it for what it was, the\r\nmansion of an ancient and wealthy family.\r\n\r\nThe progress of England in arts, science, commerce, and manufacture, had\r\ncarried Sir Roger's estate along with it. It was full of active and\r\nmoneyed farmers, and flourished under modern influences. How lucky it\r\nwould have been for the Rockville family had it done the same!\r\n\r\nBut amid this estate there was Sir Roger solitary, and the last of the\r\nline. He had grown well enough--there was nothing stunted about him, so\r\nfar as you could see on the surface. In stature, he exceeded six feet.\r\nHis colossal elms could not boast of a properer relative growth. He was\r\nas large a landlord, and as tall a justice of the peace, as you could\r\ndesire: but, unfortunately, he was, after all, only the shell of a man.\r\nLike many of his veteran elms, there was a very fine stem, only it was\r\nhollow. There was a man, just with the rather awkward deficiency of a\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAnd it were no difficult task to explain, either, how this had come\r\nabout. The Rockvilles saw plainly enough the necessity of manuring their\r\nlands, but they scorned the very idea of manuring their family. What!\r\nthat most ancient, honorable, and substantial family, suffer any of the\r\ncommon earth of humanity to gather about its roots! The Rockvilles were\r\nso careful of their good blood, that they never allied it to any but\r\nblood as pure and inane as their own. Their elms flourished in the rotten\r\nearth of plebeian accumulations, and their acres produced large crops of\r\ncorn from the sewage of towns and fat sinks, but the Rockvilles\r\nthemselves took especial care that no vulgar vigor from the real heap\r\nof ordinary human nature should infuse a new force of intellect into\r\ntheir race. The Rockvilles needed nothing; they had all that an ancient,\r\nhonorable, and substantial family could need. The Rockvilles had no need\r\nto study at school--why should they? They did not want to get on. The\r\nRockvilles did not aspire to distinction for talent in the world--why\r\nshould they? They had a large estate. So the Rockville soul, unused from\r\ngeneration to generation, grew--\r\n\r\n    Fine by degrees, and _spiritually_ less,\r\n\r\n  till it tapered off into nothing.\r\n\r\nLook at the last of a long fine in the midst of his fine estate. Tall he\r\nwas, with a stoop in his shoulders, and a bowing of his head on one side,\r\nas if he had been accustomed to stand under the low boughs of his woods,\r\nand peer after intruders. And that was precisely the fact. His features\r\nwere thin and sharp; his nose prominent and keen in its character; his\r\neyes small, black, and peering like a mole's, or a hungry swine's. Sir\r\nRoger was still oracular on the bench, and after consulting his clerk, a\r\ngood lawyer,--and looked up to by the neighboring squires in election\r\nmatters, for he was an unswerving tory. You never heard of a rational\r\nthing that he had said in the whole course of his life; but that mattered\r\nlittle, he was a gentleman of solemn aspect, of stately gait, and of a\r\nvery ancient family.\r\n\r\nWith ten thousand a-year, and his rental rising, he was still, however, a\r\nman of overwhelming cares. What mattered a fine estate if all the world\r\nwas against him? And Sir Roger firmly believed that he stood in that\r\npredicament. He had grown up to regard the world as full of little\r\nbesides upstarts, radicals, manufacturers, and poachers. All were banded,\r\nin his belief, against the landed interest. It demanded all the energy of\r\nhis very small faculties to defend himself and the world against them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his peace, a large manufacturing town had sprung up\r\nwithin a couple of miles of him. He could see its red-brick walls, and\r\nits red-tiled roofs, and its tall smoke-vomiting chimneys, growing and\r\nextending over the slopes beyond the river. It was to him the most\r\nirritating sight in the world; for what were all those swarming weavers\r\nand spinners but arrant radicals, upstarts, sworn foes of ancient\r\ninstitutions and the landed interests of England? Sir Roger had passed\r\nthrough many a desperate conflict with them for the return of members to\r\nparliament. They brought forward men that were utter wormwood to all his\r\nfeelings, and they paid no more respect to him and his friends on such\r\noccasions than they did to the meanest creature living. Reverence for\r\nancient blood did not exist in that plebeian and rapidly multiplying\r\ntribe. There were master manufacturers there actually that looked and\r\ntalked as big as himself, and _entre nous_, a vast deal more cleverly.\r\nThe people talked of rights and franchises, and freedom of speech and of\r\nconscience, in a way that was really frightful. Then they were given most\r\ninveterately to running out in whole and everlasting crowds on Sundays\r\nand holidays into the fields and woods; and as there was no part of the\r\nneighborhood half so pleasant as the groves and river banks of Rockville,\r\nthey came swarming up there in crowds that were enough to drive any man\r\nof acres frantic.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, there were roads all about Rockville; foot roads, and high\r\nroads and bridle roads. There was a road up the river side, all the way\r\nto Rockville woods, and when it reached them, it divided like a fork, and\r\none pony or foot-path led straight up a magnificent grove of a mile long,\r\nending close to the hall; and another ran all along the river side, under\r\nthe hills and branches of the wood.\r\n\r\nOh, delicious were these woods! In the river there were islands, which\r\nwere covered in summer with the greenest grass, and the freshest of\r\nwillows, and the clear waters rushed around them in the most inviting\r\nmanner imaginable. And there were numbers of people extremely ready to\r\naccept this delectable invitation of these waters. There they came in\r\nfine weather, and as these islands were only separated from the main-land\r\nby a little and very shallow stream, it was delightful for lovers to get\r\nacross--with laughter, and treading on stepping-stones, and slipping off\r\nthe stepping-stones up to the ankles into the cool brook, and pretty\r\nscreams, and fresh laughter, and then landing on those sunny, and to them\r\nreally enchanted islands. And then came fishermen; solitary fishermen,\r\nand fishermen in rows; fishermen lying in the flowery grass, with\r\nfragrant meadow-sweet and honey-breathing clover all about their ears;\r\nand fishermen standing in file, as if they were determined to clear all\r\nthe river of fish in one day. And there were other lovers, and troops of\r\nloiterers, and shouting roysterers, going along under the boughs of the\r\nwood, and following the turns of that most companionable of rivers. And\r\nthere were boats going up and down; boats full of young people, all\r\nholiday finery and mirth, and boats with duck-hunters, and other, to Sir\r\nRoger, detestable marauders, with guns and dogs, and great bottles of\r\nbeer. In the fine grove, on summer days, there might be found hundreds\r\nof people. There were picnic parties, fathers and mothers with whole\r\nfamilies of children, and a great promenade of the delighted artisans and\r\ntheir wives or sweethearts.\r\n\r\nIn the times prior to the sudden growth of the neighboring town, Great\r\nStockington, and to the simultaneous development of the love-of-nature\r\nprinciple in the Stockingtonians, nothing had been thought of all these\r\nroads. The roads were well enough till they led to these inroads. Then\r\nSir Roger aroused himself. This must be changed. The roads must be\r\nstopped. Nothing was easier to his fancy. His fellow-justices, Sir\r\nBenjamin Bullockshed and Squire Sheepshank, had asked his aid to stop the\r\nlike nuisances, and it had been done at once. So Sir Roger put up notices\r\nall about, that the roads were to be stopped by an Order of Sessions, and\r\nthese notices were signed, as required by law, by their worships of\r\nBullockshed and Sheepshank. But Sir Roger soon found that it was one\r\nthing to stop a road leading from Oneman-Town to Lonely-Lodge, and\r\nanother to attempt to stop those from Great-Stockington to Rockville.\r\n\r\nOn the very first Sunday after the exhibition of those notice-boards,\r\nthere was a ferment in the grove of Rockville, as if all the bees in the\r\ncounty were swarming there, with all the wasps and hornets to boot. Great\r\ncrowds were collected before each of these obnoxious placards, and the\r\namount of curses vomited against them was really shocking for any day,\r\nbut more especially for a Sunday. Presently there was a rush at them;\r\nthey were torn down, and simultaneously pitched into the river. There\r\nwere great crowds swarming all about Rockville all that day, and with\r\nlooks so defiant that Sir Roger more than once contemplated sending off\r\nfor the Yeoman Cavalry to defend his house, which he seriously thought in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nBut so far from being intimidated from proceeding, this demonstration\r\nonly made Sir Roger the more determined. To have so desperate and\r\nirreverent a population coming about his house and woods now presented\r\nitself in a much more formidable aspect than ever. So, next day, not only\r\nwere the placards once more hoisted, but rewards offered for the\r\ndiscovery of the offenders, attended with all the maledictions of the\r\ninsulted majesty of the law. No notice was taken of this, but the whole\r\nof Great Stockington was in a buzz and an agitation. There were posters\r\nplastered all over the walls of the town, four times as large as Sir\r\nRoger's notices, in this style:--\r\n\r\n\"Englishmen! your dearest rights are menaced! The Woods of Rockville,\r\nyour ancient, rightful, and enchanting resorts, are to be closed to you.\r\nStockingtonians! The eyes of the world are upon you. 'Awake! arise! or be\r\nforever fallen!' England expects every man to do his duty! And your duty\r\nis to resist and defy the grasping soil-lords, to seize on your ancient\r\nPatrimony!\"\r\n\r\n\"Patrimony! Ancient and rightful resort of Rockville!\" Sir Roger was\r\nastounded at the audacity of this upstart, plebeian race. What! They\r\nactually claimed Rockville, the heritage of a hundred successive\r\nRockvilles, as their own. Sir Roger determined to carry it to the\r\nSessions; and at the Sessions was a magnificent muster of all his\r\nfriends. There was Sir Roger himself in the chair; and on either hand, a\r\nprodigious row of county squirearchy. There was Sir Benjamin Bullockshed,\r\nand Sir Thomas Tenterhook, and all the squires,--Sheepshank, Ramsbottom,\r\nTurnbull, Otterbrook, and Swagsides. The Clerk of Sessions read the\r\nnotice for the closing of all the footpaths through the woods of\r\nRockville, and declared that this notice had been duly, and for the\r\nrequired period publicly, posted. The Stockingtonians protested by their\r\nable lawyer Daredeville, against any order for the closing of these\r\nancient woods--the inestimable property of the public.\r\n\r\n\"Property of the public!\" exclaimed Sir Roger. \"Property of the public!\"\r\nechoed the multitudinous voices of indignant Bullocksheds, Tenterhooks,\r\nand Ramsbottoms. \"Why, sir, do you dispute the right of Sir Roger\r\nRockville to his own estate?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means;\" replied the undaunted Daredeville; \"the estate of\r\nRockville is unquestionably the property of the honorable baronet, Sir\r\nRoger Rockville; but the roads through it are the as unquestionable\r\nProperty of the public.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole bench looked at itself; that is, at each other, in wrathful\r\nastonishment. The swelling in the diaphragms of the squires Otterbrook,\r\nTurnbull, and Swagsides, and all the rest of the worshipful row, was too\r\nbig to admit of utterance. Only Sir Roger himself burst forth with an\r\nabrupt--\r\n\r\n\"Impudent fellows! But I'll see them ---- first!\"\r\n\r\n\"Grant the order!\" said Sir Benjamin Bullockshed; and the whole bench\r\nnodded assent. The able lawyer Daredeville retired with a pleasant smile.\r\nHe saw an agreeable prospect of plenty of grist to his mill. Sir Roger\r\nwas rich, and so was Great Stockington. He rubbed his hands, not in the\r\nleast like a man defeated, and thought to himself, \"Let them go at\r\nit--all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the placards on the Rockville estate were changed for others\r\nBearing \"STOPPED BY ORDER OF SESSIONS!\" and alongside of them were huge\r\ncarefully painted boards, denouncing on all trespassers prosecutions\r\naccording to law. The same evening came a prodigious invasion of\r\nStockingtonians--tore all the boards and placards down, and carried them\r\non their shoulders to Great Stockington, singing as they went, \"See, the\r\nConquering Heroes come!\" They set them up in the center of Stockington\r\nmarket-place, and burnt them, along with an effigy of Sir Roger\r\nRockville.\r\n\r\nThat was grist at once to the mill of the able lawyer Daredeville. He\r\nlooked on, and rubbed his hands. Warrants were speedily issued by the\r\nbaronets of Bullockshed and Tenterhook, for the apprehension of the\r\nindividuals who had been seen carrying off the notice-boards, for\r\nlarceny, and against a number of others for trespass. There was plenty\r\nof work for Daredeville and his brethren of the robe; but it all ended,\r\nafter the flying about of sundry mandamuses and assize trials, in Sir\r\nRoger finding that though Rockville was his, the roads through it were\r\nthe public's.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Roger drove homeward from the assize, which finally settled the\r\nquestion of these footpaths, he heard the bells in all the steeples of\r\nGreat Stockington burst forth with a grand peal of triumph. He closed\r\nfirst the windows of his fine old carriage, and sunk into a corner; but\r\nhe could not drown the intolerable sound. \"But,\" said he, \"I'll stop\r\ntheir picnic-ing. I'll stop their fishing. I'll have hold of them for\r\ntrespassing and poaching!\" There was war henceforth between Rockville and\r\nGreat Stockington.\r\n\r\nOn the very next Sunday there came literally thousands of the jubilant\r\nStockingtonians to Rockville. They had brought baskets, and were for\r\ndining, and drinking success to all footpaths. But in the great grove\r\nthere were keepers, and watchers, who warned them to keep the path, that\r\nnarrow well-worn line up the middle of the grove. \"What! were they not to\r\nsit on the grass?\"--\"No!\"--\"What! were they not to picnic?\"--\"No! not\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nThe Stockingtonians felt a sudden damp on their spirits. But the river\r\nbank! The cry was \"To the river bank! There they _would_ picnic.\" The\r\ncrowd rushed away down the wood, but on the river bank they found a whole\r\nregiment of watchers, who pointed again to the narrow line of footpath,\r\nand told them not to trespass beyond it. But the islands! they went over\r\nto the islands. But there too were Sir Roger's forces, who warned them\r\nback! There was no road there--all found there would be trespassers, and\r\nbe duly punished.\r\n\r\nThe Stockingtonians discovered that their triumph was not quite so\r\ncomplete as they had flattered themselves. The footpaths were theirs, but\r\nthat was all. Their ancient license was at an end. If they came there,\r\nthere was no more fishing; if they came in crowds, there was no more\r\npicnic-ing; if they walked through the woods in numbers, they must keep\r\nto Indian file, or they were summoned before the county magistrates for\r\ntrespass, and were soundly fined; and not even the able Daredeville would\r\nundertake to defend them.\r\n\r\nThe Stockingtonians were chopfallen, but they were angry and dogged; and\r\nThey thronged up to the village and the front of the hall. They filled\r\nthe little inn in the hamlet-they went by scores, and roving all over the\r\nchurchyard, read epitaphs\r\n\r\n  That teach the rustic moralists to die,\r\n\r\nbut don't teach them to give up their old indulgences very\r\ngood-humoredly. They went and sat in rows on the old churchyard wall,\r\nopposite to the very windows of the irate Sir Roger. They felt themselves\r\nbeaten, and Sir Roger felt himself beaten. True, he could coerce them to\r\nthe keeping of the footpaths--but, then, they had the footpaths! True,\r\nthought the Stockingtonians, we have the footpaths, but then the\r\npicnic-ing, and the fishing, and the islands! The Stockingtonians were\r\nfull of sullen wrath, and Sir Roger was--oh, most expressive old Saxon\r\nphrase--HAIRSORE! Yes, he was one universal round of vexation and\r\njealousy of his rights. Every hair in his body was like a pin sticking\r\ninto him. Come within a dozen yards of him; nay, at the most, blow on\r\nhim, and he was excruciated--you rubbed his sensitive hairs at a\r\nfurlong's distance.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday the people found the churchyard locked up, except during\r\nservice, when beadles walked there, and desired them not to loiter and\r\ndisturb the congregation, closing the gates, and showing them out like\r\na flock of sheep the moment the service was over. This was fuel to the\r\nalready boiling blood of Stockington. The week following, what was their\r\nastonishment to find a much frequented ruin gone! it was actually gone!\r\nnot a trace of it; but the spot where it had stood for ages, turfed,\r\nplanted with young spruce trees, and fenced off with post and rail! The\r\nexasperated people now launched forth an immensity of fulminations\r\nagainst the churl Sir Roger, and a certain number of them resolved to\r\ncome and seat themselves in the street of the hamlet and there dine; but\r\na terrific thunderstorm, which seemed in league with Sir Roger, soon\r\nrouted them, drenched them through, and on attempting to seek shelter in\r\nthe cottages, the poor people said they were very sorry, but it was as\r\nmuch as their holdings were worth, and they dare not admit them.\r\n\r\nSir Roger had triumphed! It was all over with the old delightful days at\r\nRockville. There was an end of picnic-ing, of fishing, and of roving in\r\nthe islands. One sturdy disciple  of Izaak Walton, indeed, dared to fling\r\na line from the banks of Rockville grove, but Sir Roger came upon him and\r\nendeavored to seize him. The man coolly walked into the middle of the\r\nriver, and, without a word, continued his fishing.\r\n\r\n\"Get out there!\" exclaimed Sir Roger, \"that is still on my property.\" The\r\nman walked through the river to the other bank, where he knew that the\r\nland was rented by a farmer. \"Give over,\" shouted Sir Roger, \"I tell you\r\nthe water is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the fellow, \"bottle it up, and be hanged to you! Don't you\r\nsee it is running away to Stockington?\"\r\n\r\nThere was bad blood between Rockville and Stockington-green. Stockington\r\nwas incensed, and Sir Roger was hairsore.\r\n\r\nA new nuisance sprung up. The people of Stockington looked on the\r\ncottagers of Rockville as sunk in deepest darkeness under such a man as\r\nSir Roger and his cousin the vicar. They could not picnic, but they\r\nthought they could hold a camp-meeting; they could not fish for roach,\r\nbut they thought they might for souls. Accordingly there assembled crowds\r\nof Stockingtonians on the green of Rockville, with a chair and a table,\r\nand a preacher with his head bound in a red handkerchief; and soon there\r\nwas a sound of hymns, and a zealous call to come out of the darkness of\r\nthe spiritual Babylon. But this was more than Sir Roger could bear; he\r\nrushed forth with all his servants, keepers, and cottagers, overthrew\r\nthe table, and routing the assembly, chased them to the boundary of his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThe discomfited Stockingtonians now fulminated awful judgments on the\r\nunhappy Sir Roger, as a persecutor and a malignant. They dared not enter\r\nagain on his park, but they came to the very verge of it, and held weekly\r\nmeetings on the highway, in which they sang and declaimed as loudly as\r\npossible, that the winds might bear their voices to Sir Roger's ears.\r\n\r\nTo such a position was now reduced the last of the long line of\r\nRockville. The spirit of a policeman had taken possession of him. He had\r\nkeepers and watchers out on all sides, but they did not satisfy him. He\r\nwas perpetually haunted with the idea that poachers were after his game,\r\nthat trespassers were in his woods. His whole life was now spent in\r\nstealing to and fro in his fields and plantations, and prowling along his\r\nriver side. He looked under hedges, and watched for long hours under the\r\nforest trees. If any one had a curiosity to see Sir Roger, they had only\r\nto enter his fields by the wood side, and wander a few yards from the\r\npath, and he was almost sure to spring out over the hedge, and in angry\r\ntones demand their name and address. The descendant of the chivalrous and\r\nsteelclad De Rockvilles was sunk into a restless spy on his own ample\r\nproperty. There was but one idea in his mind--encroachment. It was\r\ndestitute of all other furniture but the musty technicalities of warrants\r\nand commitments. There was a stealthy and skulking manner in everything\r\nthat he did. He went to church on Sundays, but it was no longer by the\r\ngrand iron gate opposite to his house, that stood generally with a large\r\nspider's web woven over the lock, and several others in different corners\r\nof the fine iron tracery, bearing evidence of the long period since it\r\nhad been opened. How different to the time when the Sir Roger and the\r\nLady of Rockville had had these gates thrown wide on a Sunday morning,\r\nand with all their train of household servants after their back, with\r\ntrue antique dignity, marched with much proud humility into the house of\r\nGod. Now, Sir Roger--the solitary, suspicious, undignified Sir Roger, the\r\nkeeper and policeman of his own property--stole in at a little side gate\r\nfrom his paddock, and back the same way, wondering all the time whether\r\nthere was not somebody in his pheasant preserves, or Sunday trespassers\r\nin his grove.\r\n\r\nIf you entered his house it gave you as cheerless a feeling as its owner.\r\nThere was the conservatory, so splendid with rich plants and flowers in\r\nhis mothers time--now a dusty receptacle of hampers, broken hand-glasses,\r\nand garden tools. These tools could never be used, for the gardens were\r\ngrown wild. Tall grass grew in the walks, and the huge unpruned shrubs\r\ndisputed the passage with you. In the wood above the gardens, reached by\r\nseveral flights of fine, but now moss-grown, steps, there stood a\r\npavilion, once clearly very beautiful. It was now damp and ruinous-its\r\nwalls covered with greenness and crawling insects. It was a great\r\nlurking-place of Sir Roger when on the watch for poachers.\r\n\r\nThe line of the Rockvilles was evidently running fast out. It had reached\r\nthe extremity of imbecility and contempt--it must soon reach its close.\r\n\r\nSir Roger used to make his regular annual visit to town; but of late,\r\nwhen there, he had wandered restlessly about the streets, peeping into\r\nthe shop-windows; and if it rained, standing under entries for hours\r\nafter, till it was gone over. The habit of lurking and peering about was\r\nupon him; and his feet bore him instinctively into those narrow and\r\ncrowded alleys where swarm the poachers of the city--the trespassers and\r\nanglers in the game preserves and streams of humanity. He had lost all\r\npleasure in his club; the most exciting themes of political life retained\r\nno piquancy for him. His old friends ceased to find any pleasure in him.\r\nHe was become the driest of all dry wells. Poachers, and anglers, and\r\nMethodists, haunted the wretched purlieus of his fast fading-out mind,\r\nand he resolved to go to town no more. His whole nature was centered in\r\nhis woods. He was forever on the watch; and when at Rockville again, if\r\nhe heard a door clap when in bed, he thought it a gun in his woods, and\r\nstarted up, and was out with his keepers.\r\n\r\nOf what value was that magnificent estate to him?--those superb woods;\r\nthose finely-hanging cliffs; that clear and _riant_ river coming\r\ntraveling on, and taking a noble sweep below his windows--that glorious\r\nexpanse of neat verdant meadows, stretching almost to Stockington, and\r\nenlivened by numerous herds of the most beautiful cattle--those old farms\r\nand shady lanes overhung with hazel and wild rose; the glittering brook,\r\nand the songs of woodland birds--what were they to that worn-out old man,\r\nthat victim of the delusive doctrine of blood, of the man-trap of an\r\nhereditary name?\r\n\r\nThere the poet could come, and feel the presence of divinity in that\r\nnoble scene, and hear sublime whispers in the trees, and create new\r\nheavens and earths from the glorious chaos of nature around him, and in\r\none short hour live an empyrean of celestial life and love. There could\r\ncome the very humblest children of the plebeian town, and feel a throb of\r\nexquisite delight pervade their bosoms at the sight of the very flowers\r\non the sod, and see heaven in the infinite blue above them. And poor Sir\r\nRoger, the holder, but not the possessor of all, walked only in a region\r\nof sterility, with no sublimer ideas than poachers and trespassers-no\r\nmore rational enjoyment than the brute indulgence of hunting like a\r\nferret, and seizing his fellow-men like a bulldog. He was a specimen of\r\nhuman nature degenerated, retrograded from the divine to the bestial,\r\nthrough the long operating influences of false notions and institutions,\r\ncontinued beyond their time. He had only the soul of a keeper. Had he\r\nbeen only a keeper, he had been a much happier man.\r\n\r\nHis time was at hand. The severity which he had long dealt out toward all\r\nsorts of offenders made him the object of the deepest vengeance. In a\r\nlonely hollow of his woods, watching at midnight with two of his men,\r\nthere came a sturdy knot of poachers. An affray ensued. The men perceived\r\nthat their old enemy, Sir Roger, was there: and the blow of a hedge-stake\r\nstretched him on the earth. His keepers fled--and thus ignominiously\r\nterminated the long line of the Rockvilles. Sir Roger was the last of his\r\nline, but not of his class. There is a feudal art of sinking, which\r\nrequires no study; and the Rockvilles are but one family among thousands\r\nwho have perished in its practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Great Stockington there lived a race of paupers. From the year of the\r\n42d of Elizabeth, or 1601, down to the present generation, this race\r\nmaintained an uninterrupted descent. They were a steady and unbroken line\r\nof paupers, as the parish books testify. From generation to generation\r\ntheir demands on the parish funds stand recorded. There were no _lacunæ_\r\nin their career; there never failed an heir to these families; fed on the\r\nbread of idleness and legal provision, these people flourished, increased\r\nand multiplied. Sometimes compelled to work for the weekly dole which\r\nthey received, they never acquired a taste for labor, or lost the taste\r\nfor the bread for which they did not labor. These paupers regarded this\r\nmaintenance by no means as a disgrace. They claimed it as a right,--as\r\ntheir patrimony. They contended that one-third of the property of the\r\nChurch had been given by benevolent individuals for the support of the\r\npoor, and that what the Reformation wrongfully deprived them of, the\r\ngreat enactment of Elizabeth rightfully--and only rightfully--restored.\r\n\r\nThose who imagine that all paupers merely claimed parish relief because\r\nthe law ordained it, commit a great error. There were numbers who were\r\nhereditary paupers, and that on a tradition carefully handed down, that\r\nthey were only manfully claiming their own. They traced their claims from\r\nthe most ancient feudal times, when the lord was as much bound to\r\nmaintain his villein in gross, as the villein was to work for the lord.\r\nThese paupers were, in fact, or claimed to be, the original _adscripti\r\nglebæ_, and to have as much a claim to parish support as the landed\r\nproprietor had to his land. For this reason, in the old Catholic times,\r\nafter they had escaped from villenage by running away and remaining\r\nabsent from their hundred for a year and a day, dwelling for that period\r\nin a walled town, these people were amongst the most diligent attendants\r\nat the Abbey doors, and when the Abbeys were dissolved, were, no doubt,\r\namongst the most daring of these thieves, vagabonds, and sturdy rogues,\r\nwho, after the Robin Hood fashion, beset the highways and solitary farms\r\nof England, and claimed their black mail in a very unceremonious style.\r\nIt was out of this class that Henry VIII. hanged his seventy-two thousand\r\nduring his reign, and, as it is said, without appearing materially to\r\ndiminish their number.\r\n\r\nThat they continued to \"increase, multiply, and replenish the earth,\"\r\noverflowing all bounds, overpowering by mere populousness all the severe\r\nlaws against them of whipping, burning in the hand, in the forehead or in\r\nthe breast, and hanging, and filling the whole country with alarm, is\r\nevident by the very act itself of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nAmongst these hereditary paupers who, as we have said, were found in\r\nStockington, there was a family of the name of Deg. This family had never\r\nfailed to demand and enjoy what it held to be its share of its ancient\r\ninheritance. It appeared from the parish records, that they had practiced\r\nin different periods the crafts of shoemaking, tailoring, and\r\nchimney-sweeping; but since the invention of the stocking-frame, they\r\nhad, one and all of them, followed the profession of stocking weavers, or\r\nas they were there called, stockingers. This was a trade which required\r\nno extreme exertion of the physical or intellectual powers. To sit in a\r\nframe, and throw the arms to and fro, was a thing that might either be\r\ncarried to a degree of extreme diligence, or be let down into a mere\r\napology for idleness. An \"idle stockinger\" was there no very uncommon\r\nphrase, and the Degs were always classed under that head. Nothing could\r\nbe more admirably adapted than this trade for building a plan of parish\r\nrelief upon. The Degs did not pretend to be absolutely without work, or\r\nthe parish authorities would soon have set them to some real labor,--a\r\nthing that they particularly recoiled from, having a very old adage in\r\nthe family, that \"hard work was enough to kill a man.\" The Degs were\r\nseldom, therefore out of work, but they did not get enough to meet and\r\ntie. They had but little work if the times were bad, and if they were\r\ngood, they had large families, and sickly wives or children. Be times\r\nwhat they would, therefore, the Degs were due and successful attendants\r\nat the parish pay-table. Nay, so much was this a matter of course, that\r\nthey came at length not even trouble themselves to receive their pay, but\r\nsent their young children for it; and it was duly paid. Did any parish\r\nofficer, indeed, turn restive, and decline to pay a Deg, he soon found\r\nhimself summoned before a magistrate, and such pleas of sickness, want\r\nof work, and poor earnings brought up, that he most likely got a sharp\r\nrebuke from the benevolent but uninquiring magistrate, and acquired a\r\ncharacter for hard-heartedness that stuck to him.\r\n\r\nSo parish overseers learnt to let the Degs alone; and their children\r\nregularly brought up to receive the parish money for their parents, were\r\nimpatient as they grew up to receive it for themselves. Marriages in the\r\nDeg family were consequently very early, and there were plenty of\r\ninstances of married Degs claiming parish relief under the age of twenty,\r\non the plea of being the parent of two children. One such precocious\r\nindividual being asked by a rather verdant officer why he had married\r\nbefore he was able to maintain a family, replied, in much astonishment,\r\nthat he had married in order to maintain himself by parish assistance.\r\nThat he never had been able to maintain himself by his labor, nor ever\r\nexpected to do it; his only hope, therefore, lay in marrying, and\r\nbecoming the father of two children, to which patriarchal rank he had now\r\nattained, and demanded his \"pay.\"\r\n\r\nThus had lived and flourished the Degs on their ancient patrimony, the\r\nparish, for upward of two hundred years. Nay, we have no doubt whatever\r\nthat, if it could have been traced, they had enjoyed an ancestry of\r\npaupers as long as the pedigree of Sir Roger Rockville himself. In the\r\ndays of the most perfect villenage, they had, doubtless, eaten the bread\r\nof idleness, and claimed it as a right. They were numerous, improvident,\r\nragged in dress, and fond of an alehouse and of gossip. Like the blood of\r\nSir Roger, their blood had become peculiar through a long persistence of\r\nthe same circumstances. It was become pure pauper blood. The Degs\r\nmarried, if not entirely among Degs, yet amongst the same class. None but\r\na pauper would dream of marrying a Deg. The Degs, therefore, were in\r\nconstitution, in mind, in habit, and in inclination, paupers. But a pure\r\nand unmixed class of this kind does not die out like an aristocratic\r\nstereotype. It increases and multiplies. The lower the grade, the more\r\nprolific, as is sometimes seen on a large and even national scale. The\r\nDegs threatened, therefore, to become a most formidable clan in the lower\r\npurlieus of Stockington, but luckily there is so much virtue even in\r\nevils, that one, not rarely, cures another. War, the great evil, cleared\r\nthe town of Degs.\r\n\r\nFond of idleness, of indulgence, of money easily got, and as easily\r\nspent, the Degs were rapidly drained off by recruiting parties during the\r\nlast war. The young men enlisted, and were marched away; the young women\r\nmarried soldiers that were quartered in the town from time to time, and\r\nmarched away with them. There were, eventually, none of the once numerous\r\nDegs left except a few old people, whom death was sure to draft off at\r\nno distant period with his regiment of the line which has no end. Parish\r\noverseers, magistrates, and master manufacturers, felicitated themselves\r\nat this unhoped-for deliverance from the ancient family of the Degs.\r\n\r\nBut one cold, clear, winter evening, the east wind piping its sharp\r\nsibilant ditty in the bare shorn hedges, and poking its sharp fingers\r\ninto the sides of well broad-clothed men by the way of passing jest, Mr.\r\nSpires, a great manufacturer of Stockington, driving in his gig some\r\nseven miles from the town, passed a poor woman with a stout child on\r\nher back. The large ruddy-looking man in the prime of life, and in the\r\ngreat coat and thick worsted gloves of a wealthy traveler, cast a glance\r\nat the wretched creature trudging heavily on, expecting a pitiful appeal\r\nto his sensibilities, and thinking it a bore to have to pull off a glove\r\nand dive into his pocket for a copper; but to his surprise there was no\r\ndemand, only a low courtesy, and the glimpse of a face of singular\r\nhonesty of expression, and of excessive weariness.\r\n\r\nSpires was a man of warm feelings; he looked earnestly at the woman, and\r\nThought he had never seen such a picture of fatigue in his life. He\r\npulled up and said,\r\n\r\n\"You seem very tired, my good woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully tired, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you going far to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Great Stockington, sir, if God give me strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Stockington!\" exclaimed Mr. Spires. \"Why, you seem ready to drop.\r\nYou'll never reach it. You'd better stop at the next village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir, it's easy stopping, for those that have money.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've none, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"As God lives, sir, I've a sixpence, and that's all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spires put his hand in his pocket, and held out to her, the next\r\ninstant, half-a-crown.\r\n\r\n\"There stop, poor thing--make yourself comfortable--it's quite out of the\r\nquestion to reach Stockington. But stay--are your friends living in\r\nStockington--what are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A poor soldier's widow, sir. And may God Almighty bless you!\" said the\r\npoor woman, taking the money, the tears standing in her large brown eyes\r\nas she courtesied very low.\r\n\r\n\"A soldier's widow!\" said Mr. Spires. She had touched the softest place\r\nin the manufacturer's heart, for he was a very loyal man, and vehement\r\nchampion of his country's honor in the war. \"So young,\" said he, \"how did\r\nyou lose your husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"He fell, sir,\" said the poor woman; but she could get no further; she\r\nsuddenly caught up the corner of her gray cloak, covered her face with\r\nit, and burst into an excess of grief.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer felt as if he had hit the woman a blow by his careless\r\nquestion; he sat watching her for a moment in silence, and then said,\r\n\"Come, get into the gig, my poor woman; come, I must see you to\r\nStockington.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman dried her tears, and heavily climbed into the gig,\r\nexpressing her gratitude in a very touching and modest manner. Spires\r\nbuttoned the apron over her, and taking a look at the child, said in a\r\ncheerful tone to comfort her, \"Bless me, but that is a fine thumping\r\nfellow, though. I don't wonder that you are tired, carrying such a load.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman pressed the stout child, apparently two years old, to her\r\nbreast, as if she felt it a great blessing and no load: the gig drove\r\nrapidly on.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Spires resumed his conversation.\r\n\r\n\"So you are from Stockington?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, my husband was.\"\r\n\r\n\"So: what was his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"John Deg, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deg?\" said Mr. Spires. \"Deg, did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer seemed to hitch himself off toward his own side of the\r\ngig, gave another look at her, and was silent. The poor woman was\r\nsomewhat astonished at his look and movement, and was silent too.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile Mr. Spires said again, \"And do you hope to find friends in\r\nStockington? Had you none where you came from?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, sir, none in the world!\" said the poor woman, and again her\r\nfeelings seemed too strong for her. At length she added, \"I was in\r\nservice, sir, at Poole, in Dorsetshire, when I married; my mother only\r\nwas living, and while I was away with my husband, she died. When-when\r\nthe news came from abroad--that when I was a widow, sir, I went back to\r\nmy native place, and the parish officers said I must go to my husband's\r\nparish lest I and my child should become troublesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"You asked relief of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never; Oh, God knows, no, never! My family have never asked a penny of a\r\nparish. They would die first, and so would I, sir; but they said I might\r\ndo it, and I had better go to my husband's parish at once--and they\r\noffered me money to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you took it, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I had a little money, which I had earned by washing and\r\nlaundering, and I sold most of my things, as I could not carry them, and\r\ncame off. I felt hurt, sir; my heart rose against the treatment of the\r\nparish, and I thought I should be better amongst my friends--and my child\r\nwould, if anything happened to me; I had no friends of my own.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spires looked at the woman in silence. \"Did your husband tell you\r\nanything of his friends? What sort of a man was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he was a gay young fellow, rather, sir; but not bad to me. He always\r\nsaid his friends were well off in Stockington.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did!\" said the manufacturer, with a great stare, and as if bolting\r\nthe words from his heart in a large gust of wonder.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman again looked at him with a strange look. The manufacturer\r\nWhistled to himself, and giving his horse a smart cut with the whip,\r\ndrove on faster than ever. The night was fast settling down; it was\r\nnumbing cold; a gray fog rose from the river as they thundered over the\r\nold bridge; and tall engine chimneys, and black smoky houses loomed\r\nthrough the dusk before them. They were at Stockington.\r\n\r\nAs they slackened their pace up a hill at the entrance of the town, Mr.\r\nSpires again opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I should be sorry to hurt your feelings, Mrs. Deg,\" he said, \"but I have\r\nmy fears that you are coming to this place with false expectations. I\r\nfear your husband did not give you the truest possible account of his\r\nfamily here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir! what--what is it?\" exclaimed the poor woman; \"in God's name,\r\ntell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, nothing more than this,\" said the manufacturer, \"that there are\r\nvery few of the Degs left here. They are old, and on the parish, and can\r\ndo nothing for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman gave a deep sigh, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"But don't be cast down,\" said Mr. Spires. He would not tell her what a\r\npauper family really was, for he saw that she was a very feeling woman,\r\nand he thought she would learn that soon enough. He felt that her husband\r\nhad from vanity given her a false account of his connections; and he was\r\nreally sorry for her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be cast down,\" he went on; \"you can wash and iron, you say; you\r\nare young and strong: those are your friends. Depend on them, and they'll\r\nbe better friends to you than any other.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was silent, leaning her head down on her slumbering child,\r\nand crying to herself; and thus they drove on, through many long and\r\nnarrow streets, with gas flaring from the shops, but with few people in\r\nthe streets, and these hurrying shivering along the pavement, so intense\r\nwas the cold. Anon they stopped at a large pair of gates; the\r\nmanufacturer rung a bell, which he could reach from his gig, and the\r\ngates presently were flung open, and they drove into a spacious yard,\r\nwith a large handsome house, having a bright lamp burning before it, on\r\none side of the yard, and tall warehouses on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Show this poor woman and her child to Mrs. Craddock's, James,\" said Mr.\r\nSpires, \"and tell Mrs. Craddock to make them very comfortable; and if you\r\nwill come to my warehouse to-morrow,\" added he, addressing the poor\r\nwoman, \"perhaps I can be of some use to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman poured out her heartfelt thanks, and following the old\r\nman-servant, soon disappeared, hobbling over the pebbly pavement with her\r\nliving load, stiffened almost to stone by her fatigue and her cold ride.\r\n\r\nWe must not pursue too minutely our narrative Mrs. Deg was engaged to do\r\nthe washing and getting up of Mr. Spires' linen, and the manner in which\r\nshe executed her task insured her recommendations to all their friends.\r\nMrs. Deg was at once in full employ. She occupied a neat house in a yard\r\nnear the meadows below the town, and in those meadows she might be seen\r\nspreading out her clothes to whiten on the grass, attended by her stout\r\nlittle boy. In the same yard lived a shoemaker, who had two or three\r\nchildren of about the same age as Mrs. Deg's child. The children, as time\r\nwent on, became playfellows. Little Simon might be said to have the free\r\nrun of the shoemaker's house, and he was the more attracted thither by\r\nthe shoemaker's birds, and by his flute, on which he often played after\r\nhis work was done.\r\n\r\nMrs. Deg took a great friendship for this shoemaker; and he and his wife,\r\na quiet, kind-hearted woman, were almost all the acquaintances that she\r\ncultivated. She had found out her husband's parents, but they were not of\r\na description that at all pleased her. They were old and infirm, but they\r\nwere of the true pauper breed, a sort of person whom Mrs. Deg had been\r\ntaught to avoid and to despise. They looked on her as a sort of second\r\nparish, and insisted that she should come and live with them, and help to\r\nmaintain them out of her earnings. But Mrs. Deg would rather her little\r\nboy had died than have been familiarized with the spirit and habits of\r\nthose old people. Despise them she struggled hard not to do, and she\r\nagreed to allow them sufficient to maintain them on condition that they\r\ndesisted from any further application to the parish. It would be a long\r\nand disgusting story to recount all the troubles, annoyance, and\r\nquerulous complaints, and even bitter accusations that she received from\r\nthese connections, whom she could never satisfy; but she considered it\r\none of the crosses in her life, and patiently bore it, seeing that they\r\nsuffered no real want, so long as they lived, which was for years; but\r\nshe would never allow her little Simon to be with them alone.\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker neighbor was a stout protection to her against the greedy\r\ndemands of these old people, and of others of the old Degs, and also\r\nagainst another class of inconvenient visitors, namely, suitors, who saw\r\nin Mrs. Deg a neat and comely young woman, with a flourishing business\r\nand a neat and soon well-furnished house, a very desirable acquisition.\r\nBut Mrs. Deg had resolved never again to marry, but to live for her boy,\r\nand she kept her resolve in firmness and gentleness.\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker often took walks in the extensive town meadows, to gather\r\ngroundsell and plantain for his canaries and gorse-linnets, and little\r\nSimon Deg delighted to accompany him with his own children. There William\r\nWatson, the shoemaker, used to point out to the children the beauty of\r\nthe flowers, the insects, and other objects of nature; and while he sat\r\non a style and read in a little old book of poetry, as he often used to\r\ndo, the children sat on the summer grass, and enjoyed themselves in a\r\nvariety of plays.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these walks and the shoemaker's conversation on little\r\nSimon Deg was such as never wore out of him through his whole life, and\r\nsoon led him to astonish the shoemaker by his extraordinary conduct. He\r\nmanifested the utmost uneasiness at their treading on the flowers in the\r\ngrass; he would burst with tears if they persisted in it; and when asked\r\nwhy, he said they were so beautiful, that they must enjoy the sunshine,\r\nand be very unhappy to die. The shoemaker was amazed, but indulged the\r\nlad's fancy. One day he thought to give him a great treat, and when they\r\nwere out in the meadows, he drew from under his coat a bow and arrow, and\r\nshot the arrow high up in the air. He expected to see him in an ecstasy\r\nof delight: his own children clapped their hands in transport, but Simon\r\nstood silent, and as if awe-struck.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I send up another?\" asked the shoemaker.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed the child, imploringly. \"You say God lives up there,\r\nand he mayn't like it.\"\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker laughed, but presently he said, as if to himself, \"There is\r\ntoo much imagination there. There will be a poet, if we don't take care.\"\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker offered to teach Simon to read, and to solidify his mind,\r\nas he termed it, by arithmetic, and then to teach him to work at his\r\ntrade. His mother was very glad, and thought shoemaking would be a good\r\ntrade for the boy; and that with Mr. Watson she should have him always\r\nnear her. He was growing now a great lad, and was especially strong, and\r\nof a frank and daring habit. He was especially indignant at any act of\r\noppression of the weak by the strong, and not seldom got into trouble by\r\nhis championship of the injured in such cases among the boys of the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe was now about twelve years of age; when, going one day with a basket\r\nof clothes on his head to Mr. Spires's for his mother, he was noticed by\r\nMr. Spires himself from his counting-house window. The great war was\r\nraging; there was much distress among the manufacturers; and the people\r\nwere suffering and exasperated against their masters. Mr. Spires, as a\r\nstaunch tory, and supporter of the war, was particularly obnoxious to the\r\nworkpeople, who uttered violent threats against him. For this reason his\r\npremises were strictly guarded, and at the entrance of his yard, just\r\nwithin the gates, was chained a huge and fierce mastiff, his chain\r\nallowing him to approach near enough to intimidate any stranger, though\r\nnot to reach him. The dog knew the people who came regularly about, and\r\nseemed not to notice them, but on the entrance of a stranger, he rose up,\r\nbarked fiercely, and came to the length of his chain. This always drew\r\nthe attention of the porter, if he were away from his box, and few\r\npersons dared to pass till he came.\r\n\r\nSimon Deg was advancing with the basket of clean linen on his head, when\r\nthe dog rushed out, and barking loudly, came exactly opposite to him,\r\nwithin a few feet. The boy, a good deal startled at first, reared himself\r\nwith his back against the wall, but at a glance perceiving that the dog\r\nwas at the length of his tether, he seemed to enjoy his situation, and\r\nstood smiling at the furious animal, and lifting his basket with both\r\nhands above his head, nodded to him, as if to say, \"Well, old boy, you'd\r\nlike to eat me, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spires, who sat near his counting-house window at his books, was\r\nstruck with the bold and handsome bearing of the boy, and said to a\r\nclerk:\r\n\r\n\"What boy is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Jenny Deg's,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! that boy! Zounds! how boys do grow! Why that's the child that Jenny\r\nDeg was carrying when she came to Stockington: and what a strong,\r\nhandsome, bright-looking fellow he is now!\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy was returning, Mr. Spires called him to the counting-house\r\ndoor, and put some questions to him as to what he was doing and learning,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nSimon, taking off his cap with much respect, answered in such a clear and\r\nModest way, and with a voice that had so much feeling and natural music\r\nin it, that the worthy manufacturer was greatly taken with him.\r\n\r\n\"That's no Deg,\" said he, when he again entered the counting-house, \"not\r\na bit of it. He's all Goodrick, or whatever his mother's name was, every\r\ninch of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe consequence of that interview was, that Simon Deg was very soon after\r\nPerched on a stool in Mr. Spires's counting-house, where he continued\r\ntill he was twenty-two. Mr. Spires had no son, only a single daughter;\r\nand such were Simon Deg's talents, attention to business, and genial\r\ndisposition, that at that age Mr. Spires gave him a share in the concern.\r\nHe was himself now getting less fond of exertion than he had been, and\r\nplaced the most implicit reliance on Simon's judgment and general\r\nmanagement. Yet no two men could be more unlike in their opinions beyond\r\nthe circle of trade. Mr. Spires was a staunch tory of the staunch old\r\nschool. He was for Church and King, and for things remaining forever as\r\nthey had been. Simon, on the other hand, had liberal and reforming\r\nnotions. He was for the improvement of the people, and their admission to\r\nmany privileges. Mr. Spires was therefore liked by the leading men of the\r\nplace, and disliked by the people. Simon's estimation was precisely in\r\nthe opposite direction. But this did not disturb their friendship; it\r\nrequired another disturbing cause--and that came.\r\n\r\nSimon Deg and the daughter of Mr. Spires grew attached to each other; and\r\nas the father had thought Simon worthy of becoming a partner in the\r\nbusiness, neither of the young people deemed that he would object to a\r\npartnership of a more domestic description. But here they made a\r\ntremendous mistake. No sooner was such a proposal hinted at, than Mr.\r\nSpires burst forth with the fury of all the winds from the bag of\r\nUlysses.\r\n\r\n\"What! a Deg aspire to the hand of the sole heiress of the enormously\r\nopulent Spires?\"\r\n\r\nThe very thought almost cut the proud manufacturer off with an apoplexy.\r\nThe hosts of a thousand paupers rose up before him, and he was black in\r\nthe face. It was only by a prompt and bold application of leeches and\r\nlancet that the life of the great man was saved. But there was an end of\r\nall further friendship between himself and the expectant Simon. He\r\ninsisted that he should withdraw from the concern, and it was done.\r\nSimon, who felt his own dignity deeply wounded too, for dignity he had,\r\nthough the last of a long line of paupers--his own dignity, not his\r\nancestors'--took silently, yet not unrespectfully, his share--a good,\r\nround sum, and entered another house of business.\r\n\r\nFor several years there appeared to be a feud and a bitterness between\r\nthe former friends; yet it showed itself in no other manner than by a\r\ncareful avoidance of each other. The continental war came to an end; the\r\nmanufacturing distress increased exceedingly. There came troublous times,\r\nand a fierce warfare of politics. Great Stockington was torn asunder by\r\nrival parties. On one side stood preeminent, Mr. Spires; on the other\r\ntowered conspicuously, Simon Deg. Simon was grown rich, and extremely\r\npopular. He was on all occasions the advocate of the people. He said that\r\nhe had sprung from, and was one of them. He had bought a large tract of\r\nland on one side of the town; and intensely fond of the country and\r\nflowers himself, he had divided this into gardens, built little\r\nsummer-houses in them, and let them to the artisans. In his factory he\r\nhad introduced order, cleanliness, and ventilation. He had set up a\r\nschool for the children in the evenings, with a reading-room and\r\nconversation-room for the work-people, and encouraged them to bring their\r\nfamilies there, and enjoy music, books, and lectures. Accordingly, he was\r\nthe idol of the people, and the horror of the old school of\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty upstart and demagogue I've nurtured,\" said Mr. Spires often, to\r\nhis wife and daughter, who only sighed, and were silent.\r\n\r\nThen came a furious election. The town, for a fortnight, more resembled\r\nthe worst corner  of Tartarus than a Christian borough. Drunkenness,\r\nriot, pumping on one another, spencering one another, all sorts of\r\nviolence and abuse ruled and raged till the blood of all Stockington was\r\nat boiling heat. In the midst of the tempest were everywhere seen, ranged\r\non the opposite sides, Mr. Spires, now old and immensely corpulent, and\r\nSimon Deg, active, buoyant, zealous, and popular beyond measure. But\r\npopular though he was, the other and old tory side still triumphed. The\r\npeople were exasperated to madness; and when the chairing of the\r\nsuccessful candidate commenced, there was a terrific attack made on the\r\nprocession by the defeated party. Down went the chair, and the new\r\nmember, glad to escape into an inn, saw his friends mercilessly assailed\r\nby the populace. There was a tremendous tempest of sticks, brickbats,\r\npaving-stones, and rotten eggs. In the midst of all this, Simon Deg and a\r\nnumber of his friends, standing at the upper window of an hotel, saw Mr.\r\nSpires knocked down and trampled on by the crowd. In an instant, and\r\nbefore his friends had missed him from amongst them, Simon Deg was seen\r\ndarting through the raging mass, cleaving his way with a surprising\r\nvigor, and gesticulating, and no doubt shouting vehemently to the\r\nrioters, though his voice was lost in the din. In the next moment his hat\r\nwas knocked off, and himself appeared in imminent danger: but, another\r\nmoment, and there was a pause, and a group of people were bearing\r\nsomebody from the frantic mob into a neighboring shop. It was Simon Deg,\r\nassisting in the rescue of his old friend and benefactor, Mr. Spires.\r\n\r\nMr. Spires was a good deal bruised, and wonderfully confounded and\r\nbewildered by his fall. His clothes were one mass of mud, and his face\r\nwas bleeding copiously; but when he had had a good draught of water,\r\nand his face washed, and had time to recover himself, it was found that\r\nhe had received no serious injury.\r\n\r\n\"They had like to have done for me, though,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and who saved you?\" asked a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, who was it? who was it?\" asked the really warm-hearted manufacturer;\r\n\"let me know? I owe him my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"There he is!\" said several gentlemen, at the same instant, pushing\r\nforward Simon Deg.\r\n\r\n\"What, Simon!\" said Mr. Spires, starting to his feet. \"Was it thee, my\r\nboy?\" He did more, he stretched out his hand; the young man clasped it\r\neagerly, and the two stood silent, and with a heart-felt emotion, which\r\nblended all the past into forgetfulness, and the future into a union more\r\nsacred than esteem.\r\n\r\nA week hence, and Simon Deg was the son-in-law of Mr. Spires. Though Mr.\r\nSpires had misunderstood Simon, and Simon had borne the aspect of\r\nopposition to his old friend, in defense of conscientious principle,\r\nthe wife and daughter of the manufacturer had always understood him, and\r\nsecretly looked forward to some day of recognition and reunion.\r\n\r\nSimon Deg was now the richest man in Stockington. His mother was still\r\nliving to enjoy his elevation. She had been his excellent and wise\r\nhousekeeper, and she continued to occupy that post still.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years afterward, when the worthy old Spires was dead, and\r\nSimon Deg had himself two sons attained to manhood; when he had five\r\ntimes been mayor of Stockington, and had been knighted on the\r\npresentation of a loyal address; still his mother was living to see it;\r\nand William Watson, the shoemaker, was acting as a sort of orderly at Sir\r\nSimon's chief manufactory. He occupied the lodge, and walked about, and\r\nsaw that all was safe, and moving on as it should do.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing how the most plebeian name of Simon Deg had slid, under\r\nthe hands of the heralds, into the really aristocratical one of Sir Simon\r\nDegge. They had traced him up a collateral kinship, spite of his own\r\nconsciousness, to a baronet of the same name of the county of Stafford,\r\nand had given him a coat of arms that was really astonishing.\r\n\r\nIt was some years before this, that Sir Roger Rockville had breathed his\r\nlast. His title and estate had fallen into litigation. Owing to two\r\ngenerations having passed without any issue of the Rockville family\r\nexcept the one son and heir, the claims, though numerous, were so mingled\r\nwith obscuring circumstance, and so equally balanced, that the lawyers\r\nraised quibbles and difficulties enough to keep the property in Chancery,\r\ntill they had not only consumed all the ready money and rental, but had\r\nmade frightful inroads into the estate itself. To save the remnant, the\r\ncontending parties came to a compromise. A neighboring squire, whose\r\ngrandfather had married a Rockville, was allowed to secure the title, on\r\ncondition that the rest carried off the residuum of the estate. The woods\r\nand lands of Rockville were announced for sale!\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that old William Watson reminded Sir Simon Degge\r\nof a conversation in the great grove of Rockville, which they had held at\r\nthe time that Sir Roger was endeavoring to drive the people thence.\r\n\r\n\"What a divine pleasure might this man enjoy,\" said Simon Deg to his\r\nhumble friend, \"if he had a heart capable of letting others enjoy\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we talk without the estate,\" said William Watson; \"what might we do\r\nif we were tried with it?\"\r\n\r\nSir Simon was silent for a moment; then observed that there was sound\r\nphilosophy in William Watson's remark. He said no more, but went away;\r\nand the next day announced to the astonished old man that he had\r\npurchased the groves and the whole ancient estate of Rockville!\r\n\r\nSir Simon Degge, the last of a long line of paupers, was become the\r\npossessor of the noble estate of Sir Roger Rockville, of Rockville,\r\nthe last of a long line of aristocrats!\r\n\r\nThe following summer, when the hay was lying in fragrant cocks in the\r\ngreat meadows of Rockville, and on the little islands in the river, Sir\r\nSimon Degge, Baronet, of Rockville--for such was now his title-through\r\nthe suggestion of a great lawyer, formerly Recorder of the Borough of\r\nStockington, to the crown--held a grand fête on the occasion of his\r\ncoming to reside at Rockville Hall, henceforth the family seat of the\r\nDegges. His house and gardens had all been restored to the most\r\nconsummate order. For years Sir Simon had been a great purchaser of works\r\nof art and literature, paintings, statuary, books, and articles of\r\nantiquity, including rich armor and precious works in ivory and gold.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost he gave a great banquet to his wealthy friends, and no\r\nman with a million and a half is without them--and in abundance. In the\r\nsecond place, he gave a substantial dinner to all his tenantry, from the\r\nwealthy farmer of five hundred acres to the tenant of a cottage. On this\r\noccasion he said, \"Game is a subject of great heart-burning and of great\r\ninjustice to the country. It was the bane of my predecessors: let us take\r\ncare it is not ours. Let every man kill the game on the land that he\r\nrents--then he will not destroy it utterly, nor allow it to grow into a\r\nnuisance. I am fond of a gun myself, but I trust to find enough for my\r\npropensity to the chase in my own fields and woods--if I occasionally\r\nextend my pursuit across the lands of my tenants, it shall not be to\r\ncarry off the first fruits of their feeding, and I shall still hold the\r\nenjoyment as a favor.\"\r\n\r\nWe need not say that this speech was applauded most vociferously.\r\nThirdly, and lastly, he gave a grand entertainment to all his work\r\npeople, both of the town and the country. His house and gardens were\r\nthrown open to the inspection of the whole assembled company. The\r\ndelighted crowd admired immensely the pictures and the pleasant gardens.\r\nOn the lawn, lying between the great grove and the hall, an enormous tent\r\nwas pitched, or rather a vast canvas canopy erected, open on all sides,\r\nin which was laid a charming banquet; a military band from Stockington\r\nbarracks playing during the time. Here Sir Simon made a speech as\r\nrapturously received as that to the farmers. It was to the effect, that\r\nall the old privileges of wandering in the grove, and angling, and\r\nboating  on the river were restored. The inn was already rebuilt in a\r\nhandsome Elizabethan style, larger than before, and to prevent it ever\r\nbecoming a fane of intemperance, he had there posted as landlord, he\r\nhoped for many years to come, his old friend and benefactor, William\r\nWatson. William Watson should protect the inn from riot, and they\r\nthemselves the groves and river banks from injury.\r\n\r\nLong and loud were the applauses which this announcement occasioned. The\r\nyoung people turned out upon the green for a dance, and in the evening,\r\nafter an excellent tea, the whole company descended the river to\r\nStockington in boats and barges decorated with boughs and flowers, and\r\nsinging a song made by William Watson for the occasion, called \"The\r\nHealth of Sir Simon, last and first of his Line!\"\r\n\r\nYears have rolled on. The groves and river banks and islands of Rockville\r\nare still greatly frequented, but are never known to be injured: poachers\r\nare never known there, for four reasons. First, nobody would like to\r\nannoy the good Sir Simon; secondly, game is not very numerous there;\r\nthirdly, there is no fun in killing it, where there is no resistance; and\r\nfourthly, it is vastly more abundant in other proprietors' demesnes, and\r\nit is fun to kill it there, where it is jealously watched, and there is a\r\nchance of a good spree with the keepers.\r\n\r\nAnd with what different feelings does the good Sir Simon look down from\r\nhis lofty eyrie, over the princely expanse of meadows, and over the\r\nglittering river, and over the stately woods to where Great Stockington\r\nstill stretches farther and farther its red brick walls, its red-tiled\r\nroofs, and its tall smoke-vomiting chimneys. There he sees no haunts of\r\ncrowded enemies to himself or any man. No upstarts, nor envious\r\nopponents, but a past family of human beings, all toiling for the good of\r\ntheir families and their country. All advancing, some faster, some\r\nslower, to a better education, a better social condition, a better\r\nconception of the principles of art and commerce, and a clearer\r\nrecognition of their rights and duties, and a more cheering faith\r\nin the upward tendency of humanity.\r\n\r\nLooking on this interesting scene from his distant and quiet home, Sir\r\nSimon sees what blessings flow--and how deeply he feels them in his own\r\ncase--from a free circulation, not only of trade, but of human relations.\r\nHow this corrects the mischiefs, moral and physical, of false systems and\r\nrusty prejudices;--and  he ponders on schemes of no ordinary beauty and\r\nbeneficence yet to reach his beloved town through them. He sees lecture\r\nhalls and academies, means of sanitary purification, and delicious\r\nrecreation, in which baths, wash-houses, and airy homes figure largely;\r\nwhile public walks extend all round the great industrial hive, including\r\nwood, hills, meadow and river in their circuit of many miles. There he\r\nlived and labored; there live and labor his sons; and there he trusts his\r\nfamily will continue to live and labor to all future generations: never\r\nretiring to the fatal indolence of wealth, but aiding onward its active\r\nand ever-expanding beneficence.\r\n\r\nLong may the good Sir Simon live and labor to realize these views. But\r\nalready in a green corner of the pleasant churchyard of Rockville may be\r\nread this inscription on a marble headstone:--\"Sacred to the memory of\r\nJane Deg, the mother of Sir Simon Degge, Bart., of Rockville. This stone\r\nis erected in honor of the best of Mothers by the most grateful of sons.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[From Fraser's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED BOWER-BIRD.\r\n\r\nFROM LEAVES FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF A NATURALIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nElegant and ingenious as are the structures and collections of the satin\r\nbower-bird, the species of the allied genus _Chlamydera_ display still\r\ngreater architectural abilities, and more extensive, collective, and\r\ndecorative powers.\r\n\r\nThe spotted bower-bird[A] is an inhabitant of the interior. Its probable\r\nrange, in Mr. Gould's opinion, is widely extended over the central\r\nportions of the Australian continent; but the only parts in which he\r\nobserved it, or from which he procured specimens, were the districts\r\nimmediately to the north of the colony of New South Wales. During his\r\njourney into the interior he saw it in tolerable abundance at Brezi, on\r\nthe river Mokai, to the northward of the Liverpool plains; and it was\r\nalso equally numerous in all the low scrubby ranges in the neighborhood\r\nof the Namoi, as well as in the open brushes that intersect the plains on\r\nits borders. Mr. Gould is gifted with the eye of an observer; but from\r\nthe extreme shyness of its disposition, it generally escapes the\r\nattention of ordinary travelers, and it seldom allows itself to be\r\napproached near enough for the spectator to discern its colors. Its\r\n'harsh, grating, scolding note,' betrays its haunts to the intruder; but,\r\nwhen disturbed, it seeks the tops of the highest trees, and, generally,\r\nflies off to another locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Chlamydera maculala_.--GOULD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gould obtained his specimens most readily by watching at the\r\nwater-holes where they come to drink; and on one occasion, near the\r\ntermination of a long drought, he was guided by a native to a deep basin\r\nin a rock where water, the produce of many antecedent months, still\r\nremained. Numbers of the spotted bower-birds, honeysuckers, and parrots,\r\nsought this welcome reservoir, which had seldom, if ever before,\r\nreflected a white face. Mr. Gould's presence was regarded with suspicion\r\nby the winged frequenters of this attractive spot; but while he remained\r\nlying on the ground perfectly motionless, though close to the water,\r\ntheir wants overpowered their misgivings, and they would dash down past\r\nhim and eagerly take their fill, although an enormous black snake was\r\nlying coiled upon a piece of wood near the edge of the pool. At this\r\ninteresting post Mr. Gould remained for three days. The spotted\r\nbower-birds were the most numerous of the thirsty assemblage there\r\ncongregated, and the most shy, and yet he had the satisfaction of\r\nfrequently seeing six or eight of them displaying their beautiful necks\r\nas they were perched within a few feet of him. He states that the scanty\r\nsupply of water remaining in the cavity must soon have been exhausted by\r\nthe thousands of birds that daily resorted to it, if the rains which had\r\nso long been suspended had not descended in torrents.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould discovered several of the bowers of this species during his\r\njourney to the interior, the tiniest of which, now in the National\r\nMuseum, he brought to England. He found the situations of these runs or\r\nbowers to be much varied. Sometimes he discovered them on the plains\r\nstudded with Myalls (_Acacia pendula,_) and sometimes in the brushes with\r\nwhich the lower hills were clothed. He describes them as considerably\r\nlonger, and more avenue-like, than those of the satin bower-bird,\r\nextending in many instances to three feet in length. Outwardly they were\r\nbuilt with twigs, and beautifully lined with tall grasses, so disposed\r\nthat their upper ends nearly met. The decorations were very profuse,\r\nconsisting of bivalve shells, skulls of small animals, and other bones.\r\n\r\nEvident and beautiful indications of design (continues Mr. Gould) are\r\nmanifest throughout the whole of the bower and decorations formed by this\r\nspecies, particularly in the manner in which the stones are placed within\r\nthe bower, apparently to keep the grasses with which it is lined fixed\r\nfirmly in their places, these stones diverge from the mouth of the run on\r\neach side so as to form little paths, while the immense collection of\r\ndecorative materials, bones, shells, &c., are placed in a heap before the\r\nentrance of the avenue, this arrangement being the same at both ends. In\r\nsome of the larger bowers, which had evidently been resorted to for many\r\nyears, I have seen nearly half a bushel of bones, shells, &c., at each of\r\nthe entrances. In some instances, small bowers, composed almost entirely\r\nof grasses, apparently the commencement of a new place of rendezvous,\r\nwere observable. I frequently found these structures at a considerable\r\ndistance from the rivers, from the borders of which they could alone have\r\nprocured the shells, and small, round pebbly stones; their collection and\r\ntransportation must, therefore, be a task of great labor and difficulty.\r\nAs these birds feed almost entirely upon seeds and fruits, the shells and\r\nbones cannot have been collected  for any other purpose than ornament;\r\nbesides, it is only those which have been bleached perfectly white in the\r\nsun, or such as have been roasted by the natives, and by this means\r\nwhitened, that attract their attention. I fully ascertained that these\r\nruns, like those of the satin bower-bird, formed the rendezvous of many\r\nindividuals; for, after secreting myself for a short space of time near\r\none of them, I killed two males which I had previously seen running\r\nthrough the avenue.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this species is remarkable. A rich brown pervades the\r\ncrown of the head, the ear-coverts and the throat, each feather being\r\nbordered by a narrow black line; and, on the crown, the feathers are\r\nsmall and tipped with silver gray. The back of the neck is crossed by a\r\nbeautiful, broad, light, rosy pink band of elongated feathers, so as to\r\nform a sort of occipital crest. The wings, tail, and upper surface, are\r\ndeep brown, every feather of the back, rump, scapularies, and\r\nsecondaries, having a large round spot of full buff at the tip. Primaries\r\nslightly tipped with white. All the tail-feathers with buffy white\r\nterminations. Under parts grayish white. Flank-feathers zigzagged with\r\nfaint transverse light brown lines. Bill and feet dusky brown. At the\r\ncorner of the mouth the bare, thick, fleshy, prominent skin, is of a\r\npinky flesh colour, and the irides are dark brown.\r\n\r\nThe rosy frill adorns the adults of both sexes: but the young male and\r\nfemale of the years have it not.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the great bower-bird,[B] was probably the architect of\r\nthe bowers found by Captain Grey during his Australian rambles, and which\r\ninterested him greatly in consequence of the doubts entertained by him\r\nwhether they were the works of a bird or of a quadruped,--the inclination\r\nof his mind being that their construction was due to the four-footed\r\nanimal. They were formed of dead grass and parts of bushes, sunk a slight\r\ndepth into two parallel furrows, in sandy soil, and were nicely arched\r\nabove; they were always full of broken sea-shells, large heaps of which\r\nalso protruded from the extremity of the bower. In one of these bowers,\r\nthe most remote from the sea of those discovered by Captain Grey, was a\r\nheap of the stones of some fruit that evidently had been rolled therein.\r\nHe never saw any animal in or near these bowers; but the abundant\r\ndroppings of a small species of kangaroo close to them, induced him to\r\nsuppose them to be the work of some quadruped.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: _Chlamydora nuchalis_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a race of birds whose ingenuity is not merely\r\ndirected to the usual; ends of existence, self-preservation, and the\r\ncontinuation of the species, but to the elegancies and amusements of\r\nlife. Their bowers are their ball and assembly rooms; and we are very\r\nmuch mistaken if they are not, like places of meeting,\r\n\r\n  For whispering lovers made.\r\n\r\nThe male satin bower-bird, in the garden at the Regent's Park, is\r\nindefatigable in his assiduity toward the female; and his winning\r\nways to coax her into the bower conjure up the notion that the soul of\r\nsome Damon in the course of his transmigration, has found its way into\r\nhis elegant form. He picks up a brilliant feather, flits about with it\r\nbefore her, and when he has caught her eye adds it to the decorations.\r\n\r\n  Haste, my Nanette, my lovely maid,\r\n  Haste to the bower thy swain has made.\r\n\r\nNo enchanted prince could act the deferential lover with more delicate or\r\ngraceful attention. Poor fellow, the pert, intruding sparrows plague him\r\nabominably; and really it becomes almost an affair of police that some\r\nmeasures should be adopted for their exclusion. He is subject to fits,\r\ntoo, and suddenly, without the least apparent warning, falls senseless,\r\nlike an epileptic patient; but presently recovers, and busies himself\r\nabout the bower. When he has induced the female to enter it, he seems\r\ngreatly pleased; alters the disposition of a feather or a shell, as if\r\nhoping that the change may meet her approbation; and looks at her as she\r\nsits coyly under the overarching twigs, and then at the little\r\narrangement which he has made, and then at her again, till one could\r\nalmost fancy that one hears him breathe a sigh. He is still in his\r\ntransition dress, and has not yet donned his full Venetian suit of black.\r\n\r\nIn their natural state, the satin bower-birds associate in autumn in\r\nsmall parties; and Mr. Gould states that they may then often be seen on\r\nthe ground near the sides of rivers, particularly where the brush\r\nfeathers the descending bank down to the water's edge. The male has a\r\nloud liquid call; and both sexes frequently utter a harsh, gutteral note,\r\nexpressive of surprise and displeasure.\r\n\r\nGeffrey Chaucer, in his argument to _The Assemblie of Foules_, relates\r\nthat, \"All foules are gathered before Nature on St. Valentine's day, to\r\nchose their makes. A formell egle beyng beloved of three tercels,\r\nrequireth a yeeres respite to make her choise: upon this triall, _Qui\r\nbien aime tard oublie_-'He that loveth well is slow to forget.'\" The\r\nfemale satin-bower bird in the Regent's Park seems to have taken a leaf\r\nout of the 'formell egle's' book: for I cannot discover that her humble\r\nand most obsequious swain has been rewarded for his attentions though\r\nthey have been continued through so many weary months; but we shall never\r\nbe able entirely to solve these mysteries till we become possessed of the\r\nrare ring sent to the King of Sarra by the King of Arable, 'by the vertue\r\nwhereof' his daughter understood 'the language of all foules,' unless we\r\ncan\r\n\r\n    Call up him that left untold\r\n  The story of Cambuscan bold,\r\n  Of Camball and of Algersife,\r\n  And who had Canace to wife,\r\n  That own'd the virtuous ring and glass,\r\n  And of the wondrous horse of brass,\r\n  On which the Tartar king did ride.\r\n\r\nEdmund Spenser, with due reverence for\r\n\r\n   Dan Chauser (well of English undefiled),\r\n\r\nhas indeed done his best to supply the defect,[C] and has told us that\r\n\r\n  Cambello's sister was fair Canacee,\r\n  That was the learnedst lady in her days,\r\n  Well seem in every science that mote be,\r\n  And every secret work of nature's ways,\r\n  In witty riddles, and in wise soothsays,\r\n  In power of herbs and tunes of beasts and birds:\r\n\r\nbut we learn from him no more of the ring than 'Dan Chaucer' tells us:--\r\n\r\n  The vertue of this ring, if ye woll here,\r\n  Is this, that if she list it for to were\r\n  Upon her thombe, or in her purse it bere,\r\n  There is no foule that fleeth under heven\r\n  That she no shall understand his steven,[D]\r\n  And know his meaning openly and plaine,\r\n  And answer him in his language againe:\r\n\r\nas Canace does in her conversation with the falcon in _The Squires Tale_.\r\nNor is the 'vertue' of the ring confined to bird-intelligence, for the\r\nknight who came on the 'steed of brasse,' adds,--\r\n\r\n  And every grasse that groweth upon root\r\n  She shall well know to whom it will do boot,\r\n  And be his wounds never so deep and wide.\r\n\r\nBut we must return from these realms of fancy to a country hardly less\r\nwonderful; for Australia presents, in the realities of its quadrupedal\r\nforms, a scene that might well pass for one of enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: _Fairy Queen_, book iv. cant. 2, _et seq_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Sound.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French Society of Geography have just given their grand gold medal to\r\ntwo brothers, Antoine and Arnaud d'Abadie, for the progress which\r\ngeography has received from their travels in Abyssinia, which were begun\r\nin 1837 and finished in 1848.

The marchioness is seated\r\nnear a table covered with books and papers, among which may be\r\ndistinguished Montesquieu's _Spirit of Laws_ and the _Encyclopædia_, two\r\nof the remarkable works which appeared during her reign of favor. An open\r\nalbum shows an engraving of Gay, chiseling some portrait of Louis XV., or\r\nhis mistress. The marchioness is represented with her hair slightly\r\npowdered; she is clad in an open, flowered brocade robe, and wears\r\nred-heeled shoes, of a delicacy, as regards size, worthy of an Oriental\r\nfoot. In this portrait there is much to admire: the neck, which is\r\nslender and well-shaped, springs most gracefully from the shoulders; the\r\nhead, which is also admirably proportioned, is a model of feminine\r\nbeauty; the brow is lofty and severe; the lips, slightly compressed,\r\nexpress at the same time decision and irony; the eyes are of a most vivid\r\nbrilliancy, and the nose is perfection itself: in short, there reigns\r\nthroughout every lineament of this most striking countenance an air of\r\nnobility, and even of dignity, which qualifies in some measure the\r\naccounts left us by history of the share she bore in the _petits soupers_\r\nof Versailles, the masked balls of the Hôtel de Ville, and the thousand\r\nother orgies got up for the entertainment of the most dissolute monarch\r\nof (at that period) one of the most dissolute courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe history of Madame de Pompadour is not generally known in all its\r\nparticulars, though much has been written of her by persons of every\r\nshade of opinion. Some have exalted her virtues, while others have\r\nmultiplied her crimes. Both parties are right, and both wrong. A\r\ncourtier, and a man seeking to be revenged, are not historians when they\r\nwrite. With a little patience, and by a careful study of the writers of\r\nthe eighteenth century, we are enabled to seize here and there a faithful\r\ntrait of this extraordinary, yet most fascinating woman, and by\r\ndiligently sifting conflicting opinions arrive at something approaching\r\nthe truth. That Madame de Pompadour was a woman endowed with great\r\ntalents, many virtues, and as many vices, is not to be denied; that she\r\nemployed those talents in general for her country's good we think is\r\nequally true, though many writers have unjustly contended that all the\r\ndefeats and reverses of France are to be traced to the influence\r\nexercised by her over the mind of Louis XV. Beyond a doubt the ruling\r\npassion of her heart was ambition, and yet even this passion, which\r\naccording to many writers of her day was boundless, she kept so\r\nskillfully concealed from all her intimates, that not one of the many\r\ncourtiers, philosophers, and men of letters, who thronged her\r\nantechambers--with the exception, perhaps, of the Abbé de Bernis, of whom\r\nmore anon--was ever enabled to discover the secrets of that heart, which,\r\nin the words of a writer of the time, \"she ever kept closely hidden\r\nbeneath an eternal smile.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour was born in Paris in the year 1720. She herself\r\nalways said, in 1722. We are told that Poisson, her father, at least her\r\nmother's husband, was employed in the commissariat department of the\r\nFrench army: some historians affirm that her father was a butcher of the\r\nInvalides, who was condemned to be hung; according to Voltaire she was\r\nthe daughter of a farmer of the Ferté-sous-Jouarre. But this is of slight\r\nconsequence, as her true father was the Fermier-général, Lenorman de\r\nTourneheim. This individual having taken a fancy to Poisson's daughter\r\nwhen she was quite an infant, took her to his house, and brought her up\r\nas his own child. Having from her earliest years displayed quite passion\r\nfor music and drawing, the first masters of the day were engaged by\r\nLenorman de Tourneheim for his adopted child. Under a diligent course of\r\nstudy the little Jeanne Antoinette made rapid strides toward perfection\r\nin the arts she loved, and her intellectual acquirements were vaunted by\r\nall who knew her. Fontenelle, Voltaire, Duclos, and Crebillon, who, in\r\ntheir character of _beaux esprits_, had the _entrée_ of the house, spread\r\neverywhere abroad throughout the fashionable world the praises of her\r\nbeauty, her grace, and her talents.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour offered in her person the model of a woman, at the\r\nsame time beautiful in the strict acceptation of the word, and simply\r\npretty. The lines of her features possessed all the purity of one of\r\nRaphael's creations, but there it must be said the resemblance ceased;\r\nthe spirit which animated these features was of the world, worldly: in\r\nshort, it was the true spirit of a Parisian woman. All that gives\r\nbrilliancy, charm, and play to the physiognomy she possessed in the\r\nhappiest degree. Not a single court lady could at that period boast an\r\nair at the same time so noble and yet so coquettish, features so imposing\r\nand yet so delicate and playful, or a figure at once so elegant and yet\r\nso supple and undulating: her mother used always to say that a king alone\r\nwas worthy of her daughter. Jeanne, it is said, had at in early age what\r\nmight be called the presentiment of the throne, at first on account of\r\nthis frequently-expressed opinion of her mother's, and afterward because\r\nshe fancied she loved the king. \"She owned to me,\" says Voltaire, in his\r\n_Memoirs_, \"that she had a s[*illegible] presentiment that she would be\r\nloved by [*illegible] king, and that she had herself a violent\r\ninclination for him.\" There are certain [*illegible] in life in which\r\ndestiny permits itself for a moment, as it were, to be divined.\r\n[* illegible] those who have succeeded in climbing [*illegible] rugged\r\nmountain of human vanities [*illegible ] that from their earliest youth\r\ncertain visions and presentiments have ever warned them of their future\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nBut how was she to attain to this throne of France, the object of her\r\nambition? This was a difficult question to solve. In the meanwhile she\r\nfamiliarized herself with what might be considered the life of a queen, a\r\npart which, it must be allowed, she could play to admiration. Beautiful,\r\nwitty, intellectual, ever admired and ever listened to, she soon beheld\r\nat her feet all the courtiers of her father's fortune; she gathered\r\naround her, consequently, a brilliant crowd of poets, artists, and\r\nphilosophers, over whom she reigned with all the dignity of majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Fermier-général had a nephew named Lenorman d'Etioles, a young man of\r\nAmiable character, and with the feelings and habits of a gentleman. This\r\nwas the reputed heir of the immense wealth of the old Fermier-général,\r\naccording to the established laws, though Jeanne had on her side also\r\nsome claims to a share of the property. A very simple means was however\r\ndevised to prevent all after litigation, namely, by arranging a marriage\r\nbetween the two young people. Jeanne, as we have already seen, loved the\r\nking, and she married d'Etioles without her feelings in this respect\r\nundergoing any change. Versailles was her horizon, the goal to which she\r\naspired. D'Etioles, it is said, became deeply enamored of his young\r\nbride; but this passion, which amounted almost to fanaticism, never\r\ntouched her heart. To use her own words, she \"accepted him with\r\nresignation, as a misfortune which was not to last long.\"\r\n\r\nThe hôtel of the new-married couple was organized upon a lordly footing;\r\nthe best society in Paris was there to be found, for all those whose\r\ncompany was worth having deserted the _salons_ of the fashionable world\r\nfor those of Madame d'Etioles. Never until then had such a lavish display\r\nof luxury been seen. The young bride hoped by these means to make a noise\r\nat court, and thus pique the curiosity of the king. The days passed in\r\nfêtes and entertainments of every kind. The celebrated comedians of the\r\nday, the popular poets, artists, foreigners of distinction, all had ready\r\naccess to the splendid mansion of Lenorman d'Etioles, of which the\r\nmistress was the life and ornament; every one visited there, in short,\r\nexcept the king.\r\n\r\nEver since the celebrated _réunions_ of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, there\r\nhave always been in France a succession of circles of _beaux esprits_,\r\npresided over by some queen of fashion. Louis XIV. hated these\r\n_réunions_, saying that the court was spread abroad into all [*illegible]\r\nhôtels of Paris. In fact, for many, the [*illegible ] of the Duchesse de\r\nMain or of the [*illegible ]ise de Lambert, of Madame de Tencin\r\n[*illegible] Madame Géoffrin, possessed far greater [*illegible ]ons than\r\nthe already superannuated [*illegible ] of Versailles. The French\r\nRevolution [*illegible ] its rise in these very circles, for in them they\r\nlaughed a little at the great powers of the earth, and there philosophy\r\nand liberty were allowed elbow-room. Thus, at Madame d'Etioles' might be\r\nseen old Fontenelle, who believed in nothing, not even in his own heart;\r\nVoltaire, still young, and armed with the keen weapons of his ready wit,\r\nprepared to make war upon those whose reign was of this world, above all\r\nupon the Jesuits; Montesquieu and Maupertuis, born skeptics and mockers;\r\nalong with many others of a kindred spirit who had beheld the decline of\r\nroyalty and religion, when Louis XIV., in the latter years of his reign,\r\nhad permitted Scarron's widow to make religion fashionable, by cloaking\r\nFrance with the mask of hypocritical piety--a mask soon, however, to be\r\ntorn aside by Philippe of Orleans in the wild saturnalia of the Regency.\r\nThe Abbé de Bernis was also a constant visitor at the house of Madame\r\nd'Etioles; he was, in the parlance of the time, the _Abbé de la\r\nMaison_--it is true he had no other benefice--but little thought then,\r\neither the abbé of the house or the mistress of the house, that within\r\nten years from that time they would reign over France as absolute\r\nministers. There was one other individual of this brilliant circle worthy\r\nof a passing notice, and this was an amiable and simple-minded poet, of\r\ngood appearance and the best temper in the world, named Gentil\r\nBernard.[A] Madame d'Etioles used to pet him like a spoiled child. Some\r\nsaid he was her lover. However that may be, Madame de Pompadour, who,\r\nwhether she had or had not a secret penchant for the poet, never forgot\r\nher old friends, procured for him, as soon as she came into power, the\r\nappointment of librarian to the king at the château de Choisy, where she\r\nbuilt him, at her own expense, a little cottage _ornée_, named by the\r\npoets of the time, the Parnassus of the French Anacreon. This appointment\r\nwas a complete sinecure, for we know that the king never opened a book,\r\nand we are equally assured that Bernard never put his foot inside the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Pierre Bernard, nicknamed Gentil Bernard by Voltaire[1] was\r\nborn at Grenoble about the same time as Louis XV. \"It is strange,\" said\r\nMadame de Pompadour later, \"that two lovers should be born for me during\r\nthe same season--a king and a poet.\" Bernard ever refused all favors, and\r\nwas singularly devoid of ambition. \"What can I do for you, my dear poet?\"\r\nMadame de Pompadour is reported to have said on her coming into Power.\r\nBernard contented himself with kissing the hand of the marchioness. \"Go\r\nto,\" returned she, \"you will never get on in the world.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: This nickname was given in a poetical invitation to\r\n  a supper-party at Madame Duchatelet's, sent by Voltaire to the poet:\r\n\r\n    \"Au nom du Pinde et de Cythère\r\n      Gentil Bernard est averti,\r\n      Que l'Art d'Aimer doit Samedi\r\n    Venir souper chez l'Art de Plaire.\"]]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already named the Abbé, afterward Cardinal, de Bernis; and as he\r\nwas the only individual who ever succeeded in being admitted into the\r\nentire confidence of the royal favorite, a brief notice of his birth, and\r\nrise and fall at court, may not be altogether out of place, so closely\r\nlinked for many years were his fortunes with those of Madame de\r\nPompadour.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoachim de Pierres, abbé de Bernis, was born at Saint-Marcel, near\r\nNarbonne, in the month of May, 1715. His family, which was of the most\r\nancient _noblesse_, was allied to the king through the house of Rohan; a\r\ncircumstance, however, which did not prevent it being one of the poorest\r\nin the kingdom. As his relatives had nothing to give Joachim, they made\r\nhim an abbé. Like Bernard, he came when very young to Paris, confiding in\r\nhis lucky planet, smiling on every one, and reaping a plentiful harvest\r\nof smiles in return. He was then a handsome young man, with a bright eye\r\nand an animated mouth. In figure he was herculean, and here we find, in\r\ncontradiction of Buffon's saying, that the style was _not_ the man, no\r\nmore than it was with Bernard, who was also of large stature.\r\n\r\nJoachim passed the winter at Saint-Sulpice, but, like Boufflers a little\r\nlater, far from singing the Canticles, he employed his time in the more\r\nmundane occupation of scribbling love-songs. At the end of the winter he\r\nwas appointed vicar in a little town of his native department. \"Vicar!\"\r\nsaid Joachim; \"I'll not disturb myself for such a trifle.\" Shortly\r\nafterward he was nominated Abbé de Bernis; but not a step would he budge\r\nfrom the capital. In Paris then he remained, penniless it is true, but\r\nwithout a care or thought for the future, and full of confidence in his\r\nlucky planet--a confidence which, it must be said, was not misplaced. His\r\nacquaintance with Madame d'Etioles began through an intrigue which he had\r\nwith a certain _marchande des modes_, who worked for the future favorite.\r\nHaving perceived the young girl one night at the theater in company with\r\nher lover, Madame d'Etioles summoned her the following morning to her\r\nhouse, and in the course of conversation inquired if that handsome young\r\nman she had with her at the theater was her cousin.\r\n\r\n\"No, madame,\" replied the milliner; \"he is my lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! he is your lover is he? And what does he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"No great things, madame; he makes verses.\"\r\n\r\n\"A maker of verses!\" said Madame d'Etioles; \"that is amusing. Do not\r\nforget my cap, and tell your young poet to come and see me.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this invitation Bernis called on Madame d'Etioles, who\r\nReceived him with all the graces in the world, and from that hour\r\ncommenced a friendship which lasted for many years, and was the origin of\r\nDe Bernis' future advancement in the world.\r\n\r\nDespite his great acquaintances, our abbé was none the richer; but he\r\nlaughed gaily at his poverty, and waited for better times. According to\r\nall accounts the garret which he inhabited was in a wretchedly\r\ndilapidated condition; his furniture consisted of a \"bad bed covered with\r\nsome mules' saddle-cloths, which M. de Ferriol had brought from\r\nConstantinople, a rickety table covered with books and papers and faded\r\nbouquets, and an old worm-eaten arm-chair.\" Our abbé's purse was no\r\nbetter garnished than his lodgings; and so well-known was this fact in\r\nthe world, that Senac de Meilhan tells us, that \"when the Abbé de Bernis\r\nsupped out some one of the party always gave him a crown to pay his\r\ncoach-hire. At first this gift had been invented as a pleasantry, on the\r\nabbé invariably refusing to stay to supper, alleging as an excuse that he\r\nhad no carriage; but it was a pleasantry which continued for some time.\"\r\n\r\nIn society, however, De Bernis was a general favorite, and was everywhere\r\nWelcomed with open arms. They doated on Bernard, and they doated also on\r\non Bernis. Voltaire wrote in verse to both, Duclos spoke of their wit,\r\nHelvetius gave them suppers, and the women did their best to spoil them.\r\n\r\nFrom Cardinal de Fleury, however, our abbé received a rebuff. Having, in\r\norder to humor his relative the Princess de Rohan, who had lately taken\r\nhim by the hand, applied to the minster for a convent, the latter sternly\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur l'Abbé, your debaucheries render you unworthy of the favors of\r\nthe church. As long as I remain in power you shall obtain nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Monseigneur,\" replied De Bernis, \"I'll wait.\"\r\n\r\nThis repartee was an event; it was repeated and applauded everywhere\r\nuntil it reached the ears of royalty itself.\r\n\r\nOn Madame de Pompadour coming to power, the Princess de Rohan deigned to\r\nwrite to her in behalf of her dear abbé. \"Madame la Marquis,\" she wrote,\r\n\"you have not forgotten M. l'Abbé de Bernis; you will deign, I trust, to\r\ndo something for him, he is worthy of your favors.\" Apropos of this\r\nletter, Madame de Pompadour wrote the following to some minister of the\r\nday: \"I forgot, my dear Nigaud, to ask you what you have done for the\r\nAbbé de Bernis; write me word, I beg of you, as I shall see him on\r\nSunday.\" Like Voltaire, Madame de Pompadour had the mania of nicknaming\r\nher friends and acquaintances; even the king himself figured more than\r\nonce in her grotesque vocabulary.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: She always called De Bernis her _pigeon pattu_\r\n(splay-footedpigeon--on account of his large feet and his love-songs).\r\nVoltaire had previously nicknamed him _Babet le bouquetiére_, at first\r\nbecause the abbé always introduced flowers into his poetry; afterward, on\r\naccount of the resemblance he bore to a flower girl who used to sell\r\nbouquets at the doors of the Opera.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour presented her dear poet to the king, with a smile\r\nwhich so charmed Louis XV. that he offered De Bernis, in the first\r\ninstance, an apartment in the Tuileries, and a pension of 1500 livres a\r\nyear; and so cleverly did the future cardinal play his cards, by\r\ninsinuating himself into the good graces of both the king and his\r\nmistress, that, after a sojourn of two years at the château, he was\r\nappointed ambassador from the court of France at Venice.\r\n\r\nBut it would appear that the Queen of the Adriatic did not suit the\r\ninclinations of our abbé; he sighed for Versailles, and the _petits\r\nsoupers_ of Louis XV. After a very short sojourn in Venice he demanded\r\nhis recall from Madame de Pompadour, and on his return composed an\r\nepistle to his fair protectress, the opening lines of which we give as a\r\nfair specimen of his powers of versification:--\r\n\r\n  On avait dit que l'enfant do Cythère\r\n  Prés du Lignon avait perdu le jour;\r\n  Mais je l'ai vu dans le bois solitaire\r\n  Où va rever la jeune Pompadour.\r\n  Il etait seul; le flambeau qui l'éclair\r\n  Ne brillait plus; mais les près d'alentour\r\n  L'onde, les bois, tout annonçait l'amour.\r\n\r\nFor the space of ten years the Abbé de Bernis was the shadow of Madame de\r\nPompadour; he followed her everywhere, sometimes even too far. Louis XV.\r\nwould meet him in all parts of the palace, in the private as well as the\r\nstate apartments, which would make him say sometimes,--\"Where are you\r\ngoing, Monsieur l'Abbé?\" Our abbé would bow and smile, but say nothing.\r\nTrue to his character of abbé, he would listen at all the doors, saying\r\nthat the chateau of the Tuileries was for him but one huge confessional.\r\nHe ended, however, by knowing all things, and by sitting in council with\r\nthe king and his mistress; and a precious trio it must be owned they\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nBut evil times were coming on our abbé. In the ministry he was assailed\r\nby showers of _chansons_ and epigrams. The Count de Tressan, above all,\r\noverwhelmed him with a violent satire. He could no longer hold his\r\nground. Every one began to grow tired of him, even the fair president of\r\nthe council; this was the _coup de grace_. The Duc de Choiseul, after\r\nreplacing him in the good graces of Madame de Pompadour, succeeded also\r\nto his portfolio as minister. As some compensation, however, they gave\r\nhim the cardinal's hat; a circumstance which elicited from some wit of\r\nthe day the following couplet:--\r\n\r\n  On dirait que Son Eminence\r\n  N'eut le chapeau de cardinal\r\n  Que pour tirer sa révérence.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward he was appointed Archbishop of Alby; but, according to\r\ncustom, he never appeared in his diocese. In 1769 he departed for Rome,\r\nbeing nominated ambassador at the conclave for the nomination of Clement\r\nXIV., that priest so gay, so gentle, and so witty, who has written that\r\nsad people are like shrubs which never flower. Pope and cardinal\r\nunderstood each other admirably well. Our cardinal never returned to\r\nFrance; he had found in Rome a second fatherland, as sweet to his old ago\r\nas France had been to his youth. He inhabited a magnificent palace, which\r\nwas for a length of time the hospitable refuge for all French travelers.\r\nAll had ready welcome, from the humble priest and poor artist to the\r\nPrinces and princesses of the blood royal. To use his own words,--\"He\r\nkept an _auberge_ of France in a square of Europe.\" He died in 1794,\r\nfaithful to his God and to his king, and bitterly denouncing the French\r\nRevolution, which had despoiled him of his half million of francs per\r\nannum, and had swept disdainfully away all the pretty artificial flowers\r\nof his most artificial poetry. He died solitary and poor,--a strong\r\ncontrast to the style in which he had lived. But to return.\r\n\r\nMadame d'Etioles passed in the eyes of the world as a perfect model of a\r\nvirtuous wife. She swore eternal fidelity to her husband, unless Louis\r\nXV. should fall in love with her,--a reservation her husband was the\r\nfirst to laugh at. At first this strange condition was spoken of as an\r\nexcellent joke in the house; from thence it spread abroad, and finally\r\nreached Versailles. But the king, wishing to joke in return, contented\r\nhimself by saving,--\"I should like very much to see this husband.\"\r\n\r\nM. d'Etioles possessed an abandoned château in the forest of Senart;\r\nMadame d'Etioles having learned that the king frequently hunted in the\r\nforest, persuaded her husband to have the chateau newly furnished, and\r\nput into a habitable state, alleging that the physicians had recommended\r\na change of air for her vapors. The husband, suspecting nothing, had the\r\nchâteau re-furnished an decorated in the most superb style. Once\r\ninstalled in her new abode, Madame d'Etioles gave orders for the building\r\nof three or four carriages of a most fairy-like lightness and elegance of\r\nform, in which she might drive away her vapors. According to her\r\nexpectations, she frequently met the king in the forest; at first Louis\r\nXV. passed her by without bestowing the slightest attention, either on\r\nher or her equipage: afterward he remarked her or her equipage; afterward\r\nhe remarked her horses,--\"What a pretty phaeton!\" said he, on meeting her\r\nfor the third time. At length he remarked the lady herself, but it was\r\nmerely to bestow a passing remark upon her beauty.\r\n\r\nMadame d'Etioles, however, was not to be repelled; she continued to pass\r\nbefore the eyes of the royal sportsman: \"sometimes as a goddess from\r\nOlympus, sometimes as an earthly queen; at one time she would appear in\r\nan azure robe seated in a rose-colored phaeton, at another in a robe of\r\nrose color in a phaeton of pale blue.\"[C]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Soulavie, _Mèmoires Historiques de la Cour de France pendant\r\nle faveur de Madame de Pompadour_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn after days, Madame de Pompadour recalling to mind all these\r\nfollies--serious though for her--said to the Prince de Soubise--\"I can\r\nimagine myself reading a strange book; my life is an impossible romance,\r\nI cannot believe in it.\"\r\n\r\nAt Etioles, private theatricals were the fashion; Madame d'Etioles was\r\nthe Clairon, the Camargo, and the Dangeville of the troop, which counted\r\namong its members some of the most illustrious personages of the day.\r\nMarshal de Richelieu, who was to be found wherever gallantry flourished,\r\nwas an assiduous and constant spectator at these _réunions_. Madame\r\nd'Etioles, it is said, endeavored on more than one occasion to entice the\r\nking behind the scenes; but Louis, kept constantly in view by Madame de\r\nChateauroux, never once left the royal box.\r\n\r\nTwo summers thus passed away without Madame d'Etioles obtaining aught\r\nfrom the king save a cold and distant glance, or a passing word or two;\r\nand this, for a woman of her ambition, was not sufficient. She returned\r\nto Paris at the close of the summer season, determined to change once\r\nmore her plan of attack. A good opening was now before her, for Madame de\r\nChateauroux was dead, the throne of the favorite vacant; not an hour was\r\nto be lost, for, with Louis XV. who could tell how soon a successor might\r\nbe appointed?\r\n\r\nThe wished-for opportunity at length presented itself. In the month of\r\nDecember, 1744, a series of magnificent _fêtes_ were given at the Hôtel\r\nde Ville; the women were masqued. In the course of the evening Madame\r\nd'Etioles succeeded in approaching the king,--\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" she said, \"you must explain to me, if you please, a strange\r\ndream. I dreamt that I was seated on a throne for an entire day; I do not\r\naffirm that this throne was the throne of France, yet I dare assert that\r\nit was a throne of purple, of gold, and of diamonds: this dream torments\r\nme--it is at once the joy and torment of my life. Sire, for mercy's sake,\r\ninterpret it for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The interpretation is very simple,\" replied the king; \"but, in the first\r\nplace it is absolutely necessary that that velvet masque should fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have seen me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the forest of Senart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the king, \"you can divine that we should like to see you\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a month or two after this interview, according to some biographers,\r\nMadame d'Etioles, being determined by a _coup de main_ to attain her\r\ngrand object, namely, the securing a permanent footing at Versailles,\r\narrived one morning at the palace in a state of violent agitation, and\r\ndemanded an audience of the king. One of the gentleman ushers, a certain\r\nM. de Bridge, who had been a guest at Etioles during the festivities of\r\nthe preceding season, conducted her into the presence of Louis XV.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" she exclaimed, \"I am lost; my husband knows my glory and my\r\nmisfortune. I come to demand a refuge at your hands. If you shelter me\r\nnot from his anger he will kill me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that hour she took up her residence at Versailles to quit it no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWe know that Louis XV. passed his life in a state of constant lassitude\r\nand _ennui_, from which it was almost impossible to arouse him;\r\nindolence, indeed, may be said to have been the predominant trait in his\r\ncharacter: he hated politics and political matters, and all allusions to\r\nstate affairs were most irksome to him.\r\n\r\n\"Your people suffer, sire,\" said the Duke de Choiseul to him one day,\r\nafter a long political harangue.\r\n\r\n\"_Je m'ennuie!_\" replied the king.\r\n\r\nBy skillfully and constantly varying the amusements of her royal lover,\r\nwith hunting-parties, promenades, fêtes, spectacles, and _petits\r\nsoupers_, Madame d'Etioles was enabled to strengthen her empire over the\r\nheart of Louis XV., by making him feel how necessary she had become to\r\nhis happiness. One striking advantage she had over her predecessors, and\r\nthis was, the art she possessed of being able to metamorphose herself at\r\nall hours of the day. No one could better vary the play of her\r\nphysiognomy than Madame de Pompadour. At one time she would appear\r\nlanguishing and sentimental as a madonna; at another, lively, gay, and\r\ncoquettish, as a Spanish peasant girl. She possessed also, in a marvelous\r\ndegree, the gift of tears: none knew better than she did when to weep, or\r\nhow many tears it was necessary to shed. As a poet of the time has said,\r\n\"She wept with so much art that she was enabled to give to her tears the\r\nvalue of pearls.\" Those who had seen her in the morning, superb,\r\nimperious, a queen in all the splendor of power, would find her in the\r\nevening, gay, whimsical, capricious, presiding over one of these _petits\r\nsoupers_ with all the exuberant and madcap gayety of an actress after the\r\ntheater. The Abbé Soulavie, who saw her often, has left us a well-studied\r\nportrait of the favorite;--\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the charms of a beautiful and animated countenance,\r\nMadame de Pompadour possessed also, in an eminent degree, the art of\r\ntransforming her features; and each new combination, equally beautiful,\r\nwas another result of the deep study she had made of the affinity between\r\nher mind and her physiognomy. Without in the least altering her position,\r\nher countenance would become a perfect Proteus.\"\r\n\r\nWith intuitive tact, Madame de Pompadour very quickly perceived, that in\r\norder to amuse a king who took neither interest nor pleasure in arts and\r\nletters, other and more material enjoyments were necessary. She\r\ncommenced, then, by transforming herself into an actress. The king was\r\nthere like a wearied spectator of life; she felt, that in order to\r\ninterest and enliven him, it was necessary to diversify frequently her\r\ncharacter, and the spirit of her character. Twenty times a day would she\r\nchange her dress, her appearance, and even her manner of walking and\r\nspeaking; passing from gayety to gravity, from songs and smiles to love\r\nand sentiment. With syren-like voice, and a heart as light as the bird of\r\nthe air, she would invent a thousand graceful blandishments for the\r\namusement of her royal lover. Her beauty, which was marvelous, served her\r\nwell in all these metamorphoses. She dressed, too, with exquisite art.\r\nAmong the many costumes which she has invented, we may cite one which\r\nmade quite a _furore_ in its day, and this was the _negligé a la\r\nPompadour_; a robe in the form of a Turkish vest, which designed with\r\npeculiar grace the _contour_ of the figure. She would frequently pass\r\nentire mornings at her toilet in company with Louis XV., who would stand\r\nby giving his opinion and advice respecting the different costumes she\r\nadopted. The king, however, grew tired at length of having but one\r\ncomedian. In vain would she disguise herself sometimes as a farm-girl,\r\nsometimes as a shepherdess; at one time as a peasant-girl, at another as\r\na nun, in order to surprise him, or rather, to allow herself to be\r\nsurprised by him in some one or other of the many turnings and windings\r\nof the park of Versailles. The king had at first been charmed by the\r\nnovelty of the amusement, but by degrees he discovered that it was always\r\none and the same woman under a thousand different disguises.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that the king began to grow tired of this species of comedy,\r\nshe had a theater constructed in the medal-room of the palace, she\r\nherself nominating the actors and actresses whom she considered worthy of\r\nperforming with her on a stage which was to have but the king and a few\r\nfavorite courtiers for audience. The Duc de Vallière was appointed\r\nstage-manager and director; for prompter they took an abbé, most probably\r\nthe Abbé de Bernis; the company consisted of the Duc d'Orleans, the Duc\r\nd'Agen, the Duc de Nivernais, the Duc de Duras, the Comte de Maillebois,\r\nthe Duc de Coigny, the Marquis d'Entraigues, the Duchesse de Brancas, the\r\nComtesse d'Estrade, and Madame d'Angevilliers. The theater opened with a\r\n_pièce de circonstance_, by Dufresny the poet, entitled _Le Mariage fait\r\net rompu_, in allusion to the marriage of Madame de Pompadour with M.\r\nd'Etioles. The little troupe commenced with comedy, but soon descended to\r\nopera and ballet. In song and dance, as well as in the representation of\r\nthe passions, Madame de Pompadour was the only actress of real talent. In\r\nthe characters of peasant-girls she was unsurpassed; but her _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ was the part of Collette in Rousseau's _Devin de Village_,\r\nwhich she played with a _naïveté_ and tenderness that won all hearts.\r\n\r\nNothing was more difficult than to gain admission to this theater of\r\ndukes and duchesses, the tickets of admission for which were given by the\r\nking alone; and it must be said that Louis showed himself a much more\r\nrigorous janitor of his theater than he was of his palace: consequently\r\nit was no slight favor for Voltaire, who had for a length of time aspired\r\nto the pleasures of Versailles, to see his _Enfant Prodigue_ played on\r\nthe boards of the court theater. Voltaire had, like all men the weakness\r\nof wishing to govern the state; intoxicated with literary successes, he\r\nnow aspired to political honors. He hoped to become minister or\r\nambassador through the favor of Madame de Pompadour; and with a little\r\nmore tact he might have become ambassador, minister, or even cardinal,\r\nhad he wished it, but at the very moment when he fancied he had attained\r\nthe object of his ambition, he lost it forever by writing the famous\r\nlines, commencing,--\r\n\r\n  Pompadour, vous embellisez\r\n  La cour, le Parnasse, et Cythère.\r\n\r\nThese verses, as we know, provoked a little remonstrance from the queen\r\nand her daughters: all was lost for Voltaire, despite the goodwill of\r\nMadame de Pompadour, who, for the rest, seeing that the cause was a bad\r\none, cared not to risk her own favor by imprudent attempts. Voltaire\r\nnever pardoned the marchioness her lukewarm intercession; and like a true\r\npoet, revenged himself by a succession of madrigals, chansons, and\r\nrhymes, without number,--all leveled, though in a playful way, at the\r\nhead of the favorite.\r\n\r\nDuclos and Rousseau were more severe. Duclos, fully impressed with the\r\nidea that he was a great historian, as impartial as he was passionless,\r\njudged her harshly. He feared passing for a courtier, and he was unjust,\r\nShe bad attempted to attach Rousseau to herself; but the proud Genevese\r\nRepublican wrote her a letter which cut short all further\r\nnegotiations.[D] She always esteemed him, however, in a high degree. One\r\nday, when Marshal de Mirepoix, in the course of conversation, advised her\r\nnot to trouble her head about that owl, she replied,--\r\n\r\n\"It is an owl, certainly, but it is Minerva's owl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Madame,--I had fancied for a moment that it was through\r\nerror that your messenger had remitted me one hundred louis for copies\r\nwhich are charged but twelve francs. He has undeceived me. Permit me to\r\nundeceive you in my turn. My savings enable me at present to enjoy a\r\nrevenue of about 540 livres, all deductions made. My work brings me in\r\nannually a sum almost equal to this amount; I have then a considerable\r\nsuperfluity; I employ it to the best of my power, though I scarcely give\r\nany alms. If, contrary to all appearances, age or infirmities should some\r\nday incapacitate me from following my usual occupations, I have a friend.\r\n                                       J. J. ROUSSEAU\r\nPARIS, August 18, 1762.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour, with the design of still further strengthening her\r\npower at court, conceived the idea of calling in the powers of the Church\r\nto her aid. The Prince de Soubise, who was one of her most devoted\r\ncourtiers, took upon himself the task of procuring an indulgent Jesuit,\r\nwho would consent to confess and absolve her from all the sins she had\r\ncommitted at court. Père de Sacy, the priest alluded to, had, though a\r\nJesuit, preserved in some sort the habits and feelings of a man of the\r\nworld; he could, when it suited his purpose, be of his century, and would\r\noccasionally laugh a little at the severities of his order. To him, then,\r\nthe Prince do Soubise proceeded. At first he showed himself rather\r\nrestive.\r\n\r\n\"Recollect,\" said the prince to him, \"from the confessional of the\r\nmarchioness to the confessional of the king there is but a step.\"\r\n\r\nPère de Sacy could not resist the temptation of such an attractive\r\nposition; he went to the marchioness. Madame de Pompadour, proud of\r\nhaving for a confessor a man who had been appointed Procureur-gènèral of\r\nthe Missions, received him most graciously. She had other reasons also\r\nfor seeking to conciliate the Jesuit--her principal one was this:--Up\r\nto this time the Jesuitical party that had risen against her at\r\nVersailles, the queen, the dauphin, Père Griffet, Cardinal de Luynes,\r\nthe Bishop of Verdun, and M. de Nicolai, had hoped to drive her from\r\ncourt as a miscreant. Now, once declared worthy of heaven by a Jesuit of\r\nsuch high standing as Père de Sacy, would she not become in some sort\r\ninviolable and sacred? With these designs, then, she put in force all her\r\narts of seduction against her confessor; never did she display more\r\ngrace, wit, or beauty. Père de Sacy, who allowed himself to be taken\r\ncaptive unresistingly by the battery of charms thus brought to bear upon\r\nhim, visited her seven or eight times to speak of confession, without,\r\nhowever, coming to any conclusion upon the subject. As the good city of\r\nParis had not at the moment any matter of graver importance wherewith to\r\noccupy its attention, it began to grow witty on the subject of this\r\nconfession; a thousand chansons were composed upon the father confessor\r\nand his fair penitent. Piron arrived one evening at the Cafè Procope,\r\nexclaiming that he had news from Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" inquired some one, \"has the marchioness confessed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Piron; \"Madame de Pompadour cannot agree with Père de Sacy\r\nas to the style of confession.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day there was a great uproar among the Jesuits; the\r\nprocureur-général of the missions was summoned before their Council of\r\nTen, and was obliged to confess himself. He received a severe\r\nreprimand from the superior of the order, and, as the price of his\r\nabsolution, was commanded to refuse his counsels to the marchioness, and\r\nto excuse himself in the best manner he could for his previous delay.\r\n\r\nPère de Sacy accordingly presented himself for the last time before\r\nMadame de Pompadour, and the following conversation took place:--\r\n\r\n\"We cannot grant you, madame,\" began the holy father, \"the absolution you\r\ndesire; your sojourn at court far from your husband, the public scandal\r\nrelative to the favor which it is alleged the king accords you, does not\r\npermit of your approaching the holy table. The priest who would sanction\r\nsuch a proceeding, in place of absolving you, would pronounce a double\r\ncondemnation--yours and his own; whilst the public, accustomed to judge\r\nharshly the conduct of the great, would confirm the sentence beyond\r\nappeal. You have testified to me, madame, that you are desirous of\r\nfulfilling the duties of a good Christian; but example is the first of\r\nthese duties, and in order to obtain and merit absolution, your first\r\nproceeding must be to return to M. d'Etioles, or at least quit the court\r\nand seek, by penitence and charity, to repair the sins you have committed\r\nagainst that society whose laws you have outraged, and which, declares\r\nitself scandalized at your separation, from your husband.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour heard these words with the calmness and immobility of\r\na statue; but as soon as the priest had terminated she burst forth,--\r\n\r\n\"Père de Sacy,\" she exclaimed, violently, \"you are a fool, an impostor, a\r\ntrue Jesuit. Do you understand me? You have sought to enjoy a triumph\r\nover me by witnessing the state of embarrassment in which you imagined I\r\nwas placed; you would gladly, you and yours, see me far from the king:\r\nbut, poor short-sighted mortals that you are! Know that I am here as\r\npowerful as you imagine me weak and tottering; and in spite of you, in\r\nspite of all the Jesuits in the world, I shall remain at court, whilst\r\nyou and your pack will not only be banished from court, but driven\r\nignominiously out of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that hour the fall of the Jesuits was decreed. The holy fathers\r\nimagined that the marchioness, like Madame de Chateauroux, was but the\r\nqueen of a day; but they were mistaken. To do them justice, it must be\r\nallowed they believed that nothing was to be feared from such an enemy;\r\nfor it is very certain that had they seen the power of this woman, who\r\nhad all the firmness and decision of character of a man, or rather of a\r\nrevengeful woman, they would, beyond a doubt, have permitted her to\r\napproach the holy table, or even have canonized her had she been desirous\r\nof the honor.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour was born with noble instincts; her bitterest enemies\r\nhave never denied that she possessed the most refined taste in all\r\nmatters connected with the arts or letters. She sought to make of Louis\r\nXV. an artist-king; and it must be said to her praise that she ever\r\nstrove to rouse him from his habitual indolence and lassitude by leading\r\nhis inclinations into healthy channels. But, unfortunately, Louis XV.,\r\nunlike his predecessor, could never understand that great monuments often\r\nmake the glory of kings.\r\n\r\nThe _petits soupers_ of Versailles would occasionally shed a ray of\r\nsunshine, or rather lamp light, over Louis the Fifteenth's habitual\r\nennui. After supper, chansons, sallies, and repartee, would be the order\r\nof the night. Occasionally at these supper-parties some brilliant things\r\nwould be said. One evening, when some one sang a complaint upon the\r\nmisfortunes of our first father Adam, the king improvised the following\r\ncouplet worthy of the best chansons of Collé:--\r\n\r\n  Il n'eut qu'une femme avec lui,\r\n    Encor c'etait la sienne;\r\n  Ici je vois celles d'autrui,\r\n    Et ne vois pas la mienne.\r\n\r\nLouis XV. had, as we see, his moments of poetical inspiration. Anacreon\r\ncould not have sung better than this.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour, born in the ranks of the people, and seating herself\r\nunceremoniously on the throne of Blanche of Castille--Madame de\r\nPompadour, protecting philosophers and suppressing Jesuits, treating the\r\ngreat powers of the earth with the same _sans façon_ as she did artists\r\nand men of letters,--was one of the thousand causes, petty and, trifling\r\nin themselves, which eventually accelerated the great French Revolution.\r\nMadame Dubarry but imitated her predecessor when she called a noble duke\r\na _sapajou_ (ape). The _mot_ is pretty well known: \"_Annoncez le sapajou\r\nde Madame la Comtesse Dubarry_,\" said a great lord of the court of Louis\r\nXV. one day. It would be a curious and most amusing task to enrich the\r\nFrench peerage with all the _sobriquets_ bestowed by the mistresses of\r\nLouis XV. as titles of nobility upon the courtiers of Versailles. More\r\nthan one illustrious name, which has been cited by France with pride, has\r\nlost its luster in the tainted atmosphere of Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"Not only,\" said Madame de Pompadour; one day to the Abbé de\r\nBernis,--\"not only have I all the nobility at my feet, but even my\r\nlap-dog is weary of their fawnings.\" In short, Madame de Pompadour\r\nreigned so imperiously, that once at Versailles, about the conclusion of\r\ndinner, an old man approached the king, and begged him to have the\r\ngoodness to recommend him to Madame de Pompadour. All present laughed\r\nheartily at this conceit; except, however, the marchioness.\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon had not more difficulty in amusing Louis XIV. when\r\ngrown old and devout, than had Madame de Pompadour in diverting his\r\nsuccessor, who, though still young, seemed like a man who had exhausted\r\nall the pleasures and enjoyments of life. About the time when the\r\nmarchioness used to transform herself into milkmaids and peasant girls,\r\nshe commenced building a very romantic hermitage in the park of\r\nVersailles, on the outskirts of the wood near the Saint Germain's road:\r\nviewed from without it seemed a true hermitage, worthy in all points of\r\nan anchorite's abode; but within it was a dwelling more suited to some\r\nold _roué_ of the Regency. Vanloo, Boucher, and Latour had covered the\r\nwalls and ceilings with all the images of pagan art. The garden was a\r\n_chef d'oeuvre_; it was a grove rather than a garden; a grove peopled\r\nwith statues, intersected by a multitude of winding paths and alleys, and\r\nabounding with a number of arbors, recesses, and \"shady blest retreats.\"\r\nIn the middle of the garden there was a farm--a true model-farm--with its\r\ncattle, goats, and sheep, and all the paraphernalia of husbandry. The\r\nmarchioness presided daily at the construction of this hermitage.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, marchioness?\" Louis XV. would say on seeing her\r\ngoing out so frequently.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" she would reply, \"I am building myself a hermitage for my old\r\nage. You know I am rather devout: I shall end my days in solitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the king, \"like all those who have loved deeply, or who\r\nhave been loved deeply.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the time when spring gives place to the first advances of summer;\r\nwhen the trees were in leaf, and the plants in flower; when the bright\r\ngreensward, enameled with its countless flowrets, carpeted the alleys of\r\nthe park, Madame de Pompadour one morning begged Louis XV. to come and\r\nbreakfast with her at the hermitage.\r\n\r\nThe king was conducted thither by his valet. His surprise was great. At\r\nfirst, before entering, at the sight of the humble thatched roof, he\r\nimagined that he was about to breakfast like a true anchorite, and began\r\nto fear seriously that the marchioness had not displayed much taste in\r\nthe adornment of her retreat. He entered the court and proceeded straight\r\nto the door of the hermitage. At this instant a young peasant girl\r\nadvanced to meet him; as she was well made, delicate, and pretty looking,\r\nthe king began to find the hermitage more to his taste. With deep\r\nreverence his guide begged of him to follow her to the farm.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the farm, another peasant girl, more delicate still than\r\nthe former, advanced to meet him, and, with a thousand reverences,\r\npresented him with a bowl of milk. At the sight of this pretty milkmaid,\r\nwith her little straw hat coquettishly disposed on one side of her head,\r\nher white corset and blue petticoat, the king was charmed. Before taking\r\nthe milk from her hands, he gazed at her a second time from head to foot.\r\nHer arms, which were uncovered, were white as lilies; she wore suspended\r\nfrom her neck a little gold cross, which seemed to lose itself in a\r\nmagnificent bouquet of flowers which she wore in her bosom; but what\r\nabove all astonished the king were two little stockingless feet incased\r\nin a pair of the most rustic _sabots_. With a motion of innocent\r\ncoquetry, the pretty milkmaid drew one of her feet out of its wooden\r\nprison and placed it on the _sabot_. All at once the king recognized the\r\nmarchioness, and avowed to her that for the first time in his life he had\r\nfelt the desire of kissing a pretty foot. Madame de Pompadour returned\r\nwith her royal lover to the hermitage, where he could not sufficiently\r\nadmire the refined taste which had been displayed by the fair architect\r\nin the planning and arrangement of the building and grounds. This was the\r\norigin of what was afterward known as the notorious Parc-aux-cerfs.\r\n\r\nIt would be a difficult matter to study the political system of Madame de\r\nPompadour, if, indeed, she can be said to have acted on a system. It\r\ncannot be denied that she possessed ideas, but more frequently her mind\r\nwas a perfect chaos of caprices. It is well known, however, that the Duc\r\nde Choiseul, who united in his own person the portfolios of three\r\ndepartments of the ministry, and who disposed of all power, followed to\r\nthe letter the policy of Madame de Pompadour; namely, in reversing the\r\nsystem of Louis XIV., in allying himself to Austria, and in forming a\r\nleague, or rather a family pact, between the Bourbons of France, Italy,\r\nand Spain. The policy of Madame de Pompadour it was which annexed Corsica\r\nto France, and, consequently, Bonaparte, who was born at the decease of\r\nthe marchioness, owed to her his title of French citizen.\r\n\r\nWomen look not to the future; their reign is from day to day; women of\r\ngenius, who have at various epochs sought to govern the world, have never\r\ncontemplated the clouds which might be gathering in the distance; they\r\nhave been able to see clearly enough within a narrow circle traced around\r\nthem, but have never succeeded in piercing the shadows of futurity.\r\n\"_Après moi le déluge_,\" was Madame de Pompadour's motto.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century was a century of striking contrasts. The prime\r\nminister after Cardinal de Fleury was Madame de Pompadour. With the\r\ncardinal a blind religion protected the throne against the parliament;\r\nwith the rise of the marchioness's power we perceive the first dawnings\r\nof philosophy, tormenting in turns both the clergy and the parliament.\r\nUnder Madame de Pompadour's direction the king, had he been only as bold\r\nand determined as his mistress, would have become a greater king than\r\never. The cardinal was miserly and avaricious, the marchioness liberal to\r\nprodigality; she always said, and justly too, that money ought to flow\r\nfreely from the throne like a generous stream, fertilizing and humanizing\r\nthe entire State. The cardinal had been hostile to Austria, and favorable\r\nto Prussia; the marchioness made war with Frederick to humor\r\nMarie-Thérèse. The battle of Rosbach certainly belied her policy, but, to\r\nuse her own words, \"Had she the privilege of making heroes?\"\r\n\r\nAnd after all, is the historian justified in accusing this woman of all\r\nthe dishonors and defeats of the reign of Louis XV.? She attained to\r\npower just as the old legitimate royalty--the royalty, as the French\r\nwould call it, _par la grace de Dieu_--was fast giving way before the\r\nroyalty of opinion. There was nothing left to be done at Versailles,\r\nsimply because in Paris the power was already in the hands of Voltaire,\r\nMontesquieu, Rousseau, and Diderot. And so well did Madame de Pompadour\r\ncomprehend this future royalty, that far from seeking to arrest its\r\nprogress, she, on the contrary, sought to meet it half way. For we do not\r\nfind her openly protecting and encouraging the philosophers of the day;\r\nthose very men who, by the mere force of ideas, were destined to\r\noverthrow that throne on which she herself was seated! Thus we find also\r\nthe various painters of the time, in their several portraits of the\r\nfavorite, never failing to represent her surrounded with all the more\r\ncelebrated revolutionary books of the day, such as the _Encyclopaedia_,\r\nthe _Philosophical Dictionary_, the _Spirit of Laws_, and the _Social\r\nContract_.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour, woman-like, loved revenge; and this, it must be\r\nsaid, was her worst vice. For a word she sent Latude to the Bastille; for\r\na couplet she exiled the minister Maurepas. Frederick of Prussia took it\r\ninto his head one day, in a moment of gayety, to call her Cotillon II.,\r\ninstead of Madame la Marquise de Pompadour, and styled her reign of favor\r\n_le régne de Cotillon_; a witticism which so incensed her, that,\r\naccording to some writers, we may trace to this petty cause the origin of\r\nthe disastrous seven years' war.\r\n\r\nThe position of Madame de Pompadour at court as first favorite was, by\r\nall accounts, far from being an enviable one; as years rolled on she\r\nfound herself necessitated to stoop to all kinds of meannesses, and to\r\nendure all sorts of humiliations, to preserve her already tottering\r\nempire. In order to make friends for herself in the parliament, she\r\nsuppressed the Jesuits; and she afterward exiled the parliament in order\r\nto conciliate the clergy. Again, to prevent her royal, but most fickle\r\nminded lover, from choosing another mistress out of the ranks of the\r\ncourt ladies, she contrived that seraglio, the notorious Parc-aux-cerfs,\r\n\"the pillow of Louis the Fifteenth's debaucheries,\" as Chateaubriand\r\ncalled it; at the last, hated and despised by all France, Madame de\r\nPompadour said to Louis XV., \"For mercy's sake, keep me near you: I\r\nprotect you; I take upon myself all the hatred of France; evil times are\r\ncome for kings; so soon as I am gone, all the insults which are now\r\nleveled at Madame de Pompadour will be addressed to the king.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many desperate attempts which were made from time to time to\r\ndethrone her, the following is the most curious:--\r\n\r\nM. d'Argenson and Madame d'Estrade had resolved upon raising to the\r\nthrone of the favorite the young and beautiful Madame de Choiseul, wife\r\nof the court usher. The intrigue was conducted with so much art that the\r\nking granted an interview. At the hour fixed upon for the meeting a great\r\nagitation reigned in the cabinet of the minister. M. d'Argenson and\r\nMadame d'Estrade awaited the event with anxiety; Quesnai, physician to\r\nthe king and to the favorite, was also present. All at once Madame de\r\nChoiseul rushed into the room; Madame d'Estrade ran to meet her with open\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Madame de Choiseul; \"I am loved; _she_ is going to be\r\ndismissed. He has given me his royal word on it.\"\r\n\r\nA burst of joy resounded through the cabinet. Quesnai was, as we know,\r\nthe friend of Madame de Pompadour; but he was at the same time the friend\r\nof Madame d'Estrade. M. d'Argenson imagined that in this revolution he\r\nwould remain neuter at least, but he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said he, \"nothing changes for you; we trust that you will\r\nremain with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" coldly replied Quesnai, rising from his seat, \"I\r\nhave been attached to Madame de Pompadour in her prosperity, and I shall\r\nremain so in her disgrace;\" and so saying he left the room.\r\n\r\nThis Quesnai, of whom we have just made mention, was a man of uncouth and\r\nrustic manners, a true Danubian peasant. He inhabited a little _entresol_\r\nabove the apartments of Madame de Pompadour at Versailles, where he would\r\npass the whole of his time absorbed in schemes of political economy.\r\nQuesnai, however, did not want for friends, as he could boast of the\r\nesteem of all the most illustrious philosophers of the day. For those\r\npersons who did not go to court would come once a month to dine with the\r\ncourt physician. Marmontel, in his _Memoirs_, relates that he has dined\r\nthere in company with Diderot, D'Alembert, Duclos, Helvetius, Turgot, and\r\nBuffon,--a goodly array of intellect. Thus on the ground floor they\r\ndeliberated on peace and war, on the choice of ministers, the suppression\r\nof the Jesuits, the exile of the parliament, and the future destinies of\r\nFrance; while above stairs those who had not power, but who possessed\r\nideas, labored unwittingly at the future destinies of the world. What was\r\nconcocted in the _rez-de-chaussée_ was demolished in the _entresol_. It\r\nwould frequently happen, too, that Madame de Pompadour who could not\r\nreceive the guests of Quesnai in her own apartments, would ascend to\r\nthose of her physician to see and chat with them.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday morning Madame de Pompadour received at her toilet all the\r\nartists, literary men, and great personages of the court, who had the\r\n_entrée_ of her apartments. Marmontel relates that on the arrival of\r\nDuclos and De Bernis, who never missed a single Sunday, she would say to\r\nthe first, with a light air, \"_Bon jour, Duclos_;\" to the second, with an\r\nair and voice more amiable, \"_Bon jour_, abbé:\" accompanying her words\r\noccasionally with a little tap on his cheek. Artists and men of letters\r\nwere invariably better received than the titled courtiers of France;\r\nwhile many of the nobility were truly lords-in-waiting, the two Vanloos,\r\nDe la Tour, Boucher, and Cochin, had never to remain in the antechamber.\r\nThe account of her first and only interview with Crebillon is\r\ninteresting. Some one had informed her that the old tragic poet was\r\nliving in the Marais, surrounded by his cats and dogs, in a state of\r\npoverty and neglect. \"What say you!\" she exclaimed; \"in poverty and\r\nneglect?\" She ran to seek the king, and asked for a pension for the poet\r\nof one hundred louis a-year from her privy purse. When Crebillon came to\r\nVersailles to thank her, she was in bed. \"Let him come in,\" she\r\nexclaimed, \"that I may see the gray-headed genius.\" At the sight of\r\nthe fine old man--Crebillon was then eighty years of age--so poor and yet\r\nso proud, she was affected to tears. She received him with so touching a\r\ngrace that the old poet was deeply moved. As he leaned over the bed to\r\nkiss her hand, the king appeared. \"Ah, madame,\" exclaimed Crebillon, \"the\r\nking has surprised us! I am lost!\" This sally amused Louis XV. vastly;\r\nCrebillon's success was decided.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour passed her last days in a state of deep dejection. As\r\nshe was now in the decline both of her favor and of her reign, she no\r\nlonger had friends; even the king himself, though still submitting to her\r\nguidance, loved her no more. The Jesuits, too, whom she had driven from\r\ncourt, overwhelmed her with letters, in which they strove to depict to\r\nher the terrors of everlasting punishment.[E] Every hour that struck\r\nseemed to toll for her the death-knell of all her hopes and joys. On her\r\nfirst appearance at court, proud of her youth, her beauty, and her\r\nbrilliant complexion, she had proscribed rouge and patches, saying that\r\nlife was not a masked ball. She had now reached that sad period of life\r\nwhen she would be compelled to choose between rouge or the first wrinkles\r\nof incipient old age. \"I shall never survive it,\" she used to say,\r\nmournfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: The fear of losing her power, and of becoming once more a\r\n_bourgeoise_ of Paris, perpetually tormented her. After she had succeeded\r\nin suppressing the Jesuits, she fancied she beheld in each monk of the\r\norder as assassin and a poisoner.--_Mémoires historiques de la Cour de\r\nFrance_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night, during the year 1760, she was seized with a violent trembling,\r\nand sitting up in bed, called Madame du Hausset.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" she said, \"I am going to die. Madame de Vintimille and\r\nMadame de Chateauroux both died _as young as myself_: it is a species of\r\nfatality which strikes all those who have loved the king. What I regret\r\nleast is life,--I am weary of flatteries and insults, of friendships and\r\nhatreds; but I own to you that I am terrified at the idea of being cast\r\ninto some ditch or other, whether it be by the clergy, by Monseigneur the\r\nDauphin, or by the people of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nMadame du Hausset took her hands within her own, and assured her that if\r\nFrance had the misfortune to lose her, the king would not fail to give\r\nher a burial worthy of her rank and station.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" rejoined Madame de Pompadour, \"a burial worthy of me!--when we\r\nrecollect that Madame de Mailly, repenting of having been his first\r\nmistress, desired to be interred in the cemetery of the Innocents; and\r\nnot only that, but even under the common water-pipe.\"\r\n\r\nShe passed the night in tears. On the following morning, however, she\r\nresumed a little courage, and hastened to call to her aid all the\r\nresources of art to conceal the first ravages of time; but in vain did\r\nshe seek to recover that adorable smile which twenty years before had\r\nmade Louis XV. forget that he was King of France.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth she showed herself in Paris no more; and at court\r\nshe would only appear by candle-light, and then in the apparel of a Queen\r\nof Golconda, crowned with diamonds, her arms covered with bracelets, and\r\nwearing a magnificent Indian robe, embroidered with gold and silver. She\r\nwas always the beautiful Marchioness de Pompadour, but a closer\r\ninspection would show that the lovely face of former days was now but a\r\nmade-up face, still charming, but like a restored painting, showing\r\nevident symptoms of having been here and there effaced and retouched.\r\nIt was in the mouth that she first lost her beauty. She had in early life\r\nacquired the habit of biting her lips to conceal her emotions, and at\r\nthirty years of age her mouth had lost all its vivid brilliancy of color.\r\n\r\nSome persons have stated that Madame de Pompadour died from the effects\r\nof poison, administered either by the Jesuits, who never ceased\r\npersecuting her with anonymous letters, or by her enemies at Versailles;\r\nbut this story is not deserving of credit. Most persons are agreed that\r\nMadame de Pompadour died simply because she was five and forty years of\r\nage; and owing as she did all her power but to the charm of her beauty,\r\nits loss she was unable to survive. She suffered for a length of time in\r\nsilence, hiding ever under a pallid smile the death she already felt in\r\nher heart. At length she took to her bed--that bed from which she was\r\nfated to rise no more. She was then at the Chateau of Choisy; neither the\r\nking nor his courtiers imagined that her disease was serious, but she\r\nherself well knew that her hour was come. She entreated the king to have\r\nher removed to Versailles; she wished to die upon the throne of her\r\nglory--to die as a queen in the royal palace, still issuing her orders to\r\nthe troop of servile courtiers who were accustomed to wait humbly at her\r\nfootstool.\r\n\r\nLike Diana de Poitiers, Gabrielle d'Estrées, and Madame de Maintenon, she\r\ndied in April. The curé of the Madeleine was present during her last\r\nmoments. As the old man was preparing to retire, after giving her the\r\nbenediction, she rallied for a moment, for she was then almost dead, and\r\nsaid to him, \"Wait a bit, Monsieur le Curé, we will go together.\" These\r\nwere her last words.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the king had testified at least the semblance of\r\nfriendship and gratitude toward Madame de Pompadour, but no sooner had\r\nshe breathed her last than he began to consider how he could, in the\r\nspeediest manner possible, get rid of her mortal remains. He gave\r\nimmediate orders for the removal of the body to her house in Paris. As\r\nthe conveyance was about to start, the king, who was standing at one of\r\nthe windows of the Chateau, seeing a violent hailstorm breaking over\r\nVersailles, said, with a smile, half sad, half ironical, \"The marchioness\r\nwill have bad weather for her journey!\"\r\n\r\nThat same day Madame de Pompadour's will was opened in his presence.\r\nAlthough she had long since been far from his heart, he could not\r\nrestrain a tear at the reading of the document.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness, in her will, had forgotten none of her friends, nor any\r\nof her servants; the king himself was named. \"I entreat the king,\" she\r\nwrote, \"to accept the gift I make him of my hôtel in Paris, in order that\r\nit may become the palace of one of his children: it is my desire that it\r\nmay become the residence of Monseigneur le Comte de Provence.\" This hotel\r\nof Madame de Pompadour has since then been inhabited by illustrious\r\nhosts, for it is better known at the present day under the designation of\r\nthe Elysée Bourbon, or rather the Elysée National.\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour had several residences: she had received from the\r\nking an hôtel at Paris and one at Fontainebleau; the estate of Crecy, the\r\nchâteau of Aulnay, Brimborion sur Bellevue, the seigniories of Marigny\r\nand of Saint-Rémy; an hotel at Compiegne, and one at Versailles; without\r\ncounting the millions of francs in money bestowed at various times in\r\naddition to her regular income, for they never counted francs at\r\nVerseilles then.[F] For all this, we find Louis XV. giving the Marquis de\r\nMarigny, her brother, an order for two hundred and thirty thousand\r\nfrancs, _to assist him in paying the debts of the marchioness_. (_Journal\r\nof Louis XV._, published at the trial of Louis XVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Except Louis XV., who, it is said, used to amuse himself by\r\nmaking a private treasury. When he lost at play, he used always to pay\r\nout of the royal treasury.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marchioness was interred in a vault of the church of the Capuchins;\r\nby dint of interest and money her family had obtained the privilege of\r\nhaving a funeral oration pronounced over her mortal remains. This oration\r\nwas a _chef d'oeuvre_, which ought most certainly to have been preserved\r\nfor the honor of the Church. Unfortunately, this curious and most\r\nremarkable piece of eloquence was never printed, and history has\r\ninscribed but a few lines in its annals. When the priest approached the\r\nbier, he sprinkled the holy water, made the sign of the cross, and\r\ncommenced his discourse in the following terms:--\"I receive the body of\r\nthe most high and powerful lady, Madame le Marquise de Pompadour, maid of\r\nhonour to the queen. She was in the school of all virtues,\" &c. The\r\nremainder of this most edifying discourse is lost in oblivion, but surely\r\nthe force of humbug could no further go.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu's prediction concerning two remarkable personages of the\r\neighteenth century (Voltaire and Madame de Pompadour) is\r\ncurious,--curious alike for its truth, and for the knowledge of the world\r\ndisplayed by it.\r\n\r\nOne day, while on a visit to Ferney, Montesquieu being alone in\r\nVoltaire's magnificent saloon, which opened on the Lake of Geneva, was\r\nsurprised by Marshal Richelieu (who had come over from Lyons to see how\r\nVoltaire would play in the _Orphan of China_) standing in deep thought\r\nbefore a pair of portraits which hung upon the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Monsieur le President,\" said he, \"you are studying, I perceive,\r\nWit and Beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wit and Beauty, Marshal!\" replied Montesquieu; \"you see before you the\r\nportraits of a man and a woman who will be the representatives of our\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nAnd has not this prediction of Montesquieu's been in some sort\r\nfulfilled?--Historians have styled the seventeenth century the century of\r\nLouis XIV. Could not the eighteenth be with more justice designated the\r\ncentury of Voltaire and Madame de Pompadour? For if these two characters\r\nbe carefully studied, the entire spirit of the age will in them be found\r\nfaithfully depicted.\r\n\r\nBut, O vanity of vanities! Madame de Pompadour, with all her wit, and\r\ngrace, and beauty, after having strutted and fretted her little hour on\r\nlife's fitful stage, has vanished from the theater of the world into\r\nutter oblivion, leaving, literally speaking, scarcely a trace behind. In\r\nthe words of Diderot we may ask, \"What now remains of this woman, the\r\ndispenser of millions, who overthrew the entire political system of\r\nEurope, and left her country dishonored, powerless, and impoverished,\r\nboth in mind and resources? The Treaty of Versailles, which will last as\r\nlong as it can; a statue by Bouchardon, which will be always admired; a\r\nfew stones engraved by Gay, which will astonish a future generation of\r\nantiquarians; a pretty little picture by Vanloo; and a handful of ashes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Eliza Cook's Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH OF THE VASA D'AGUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne very hot evening, in the year 1815, the curate of San Pedro, a\r\nvillage distant but a few leagues from Seville, returned very much\r\nfatigued to his poor home; his worthy housekeeper, Senora Margarita,\r\nabout seventy years of age, awaited him. However much any one might have\r\nbeen accustomed to distress and privation among the Spanish peasantry, it\r\nwas impossible not to be struck with the evidence of poverty in the house\r\nof the good priest. The nakedness of the walls, and scantiness of the\r\nfurniture, were the more apparent, from a certain air about them of\r\nbetter days. Senora Margarita had just prepared for her master's supper\r\nan olla podrida, which notwithstanding the sauce, and high sounding name,\r\nwas nothing more than the remains of his dinner, which she had disguised\r\nwith the greatest skill. The curate, gratified at the odor of this savory\r\ndish, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, Margarita, for this dainty dish. By San Pedro, friend, you\r\nmay well bless your stars to find such a supper in the house of your\r\nhost.\"\r\n\r\nAt the word host, Margarita raised her eyes, and beheld a stranger who\r\nAccompanied her master. The face of the old dame assumed suddenly an\r\nexpression of wrath and disappointment; her angry glances fell on the new\r\ncomer, and again on her master, who looked down, and said with the\r\ntimidity of a child who dreads the remonstrance of his parent:--\r\n\r\n\"Peace, Margarita, where there is enough, for two, there is always enough\r\nfor three, and you would not have wished me to leave a Christian to\r\nstarve? he has not eaten for three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Santa Maria! he a Christian, he looks more like a robber,\" and muttering\r\nto herself, the housekeeper left the room. During this parley, the\r\nstranger remained motionless at the threshold of the door; he was tall,\r\nwith long black hair, and flashing eyes, his clothes were in tatters, and\r\nthe long rifle which he carried excited distrust rather than favor.\r\n\r\n\"Must I go away?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nThe curate replied, with an emphatic gesture, \"never shall he, whom I\r\nshelter, be driven away, or made unwelcome: but sit down, put aside your\r\ngun, let us say grace, and to our repast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never quit my weapon; as the proverb says, two friends are one, my\r\nrifle is my best friend; I shall keep it between my knees. Though you may\r\nnot send me from your house till it suits me, there are others who would\r\nmake me leave theirs against my will, and perhaps head-foremost. Now to\r\nyour health, let us eat.\" The curate himself, although a man of good\r\nappetite, was amazed at the voracity of the stranger, who seemed to bolt\r\nrather than eat almost the whole of the dish, besides drinking the whole\r\nflask of wine, and leaving none for his host, or scarcely a morsel of the\r\nenormous loaf which occupied a corner of the table. Whilst he was eating\r\nso voraciously, he started at the slightest noise; if a gust of wind\r\nsuddenly closed the door, he sprang up and leveling his rifle, seemed\r\ndetermined to repel intrusion; having recovered from his alarm, he again\r\nsat down, and went on with his repast. \"Now,\" said he, speaking with his\r\nmouth full, \"I must tax your kindness to the utmost. I am wounded in the\r\nthigh, and eight days have passed without its being dressed. Give me a\r\nfew bits of linen, then you shall be rid of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to rid myself of you,\" replied the curate, interested in\r\nhis guest in spite of his threatening demeanor, by his strange exciting\r\nconversation. \"I am somewhat of a doctor; you will not have the\r\nawkwardness of a country barber, or dirty bandages to complain of, you\r\nshall see.\" so speaking, he drew forth, from a closet a bundle containing\r\nall things needed, and turning up his sleeves, prepared himself to\r\ndischarge the duty of a surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe wound was deep, a ball had passed through the stranger's thigh, who,\r\nto be able to walk, must have exerted a strength and courage more than\r\nhuman. \"You will not be able to proceed on your journey to-day,\" said the\r\ncurate, probing the wound with the satisfaction of an amateur artist.\r\n\"You must remain here to-night; good rest will restore your health and\r\nabate the inflammation, and the swelling will go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must depart to-day, at this very hour,\" replied the stranger, with a\r\nmournful sigh. \"There are some who wait for me, others who seek me,\" he\r\nadded with a ferocious smile. \"Come, let us see, have you done your\r\ndressing? Good: here am I light and easy, as if I never had been wounded.\r\nGive me a loaf--take this piece of gold in payment for your hospitality,\r\nand farewell.\" The curate refused the tendered gold with emphasis. \"As\r\nyou please, pardon me--farewell.\" So saying, the stranger departed,\r\ntaking with him the loaf which Margarita had so unwillingly brought at\r\nher master's order. Soon his tall figure disappeared in the foliage of\r\nthe wood about the village.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the report of fire-arms was heard. The stranger\r\nreappeared, bleeding, and wounded in the breast. He was ghastly, as if\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, presenting to the old priest some pieces of gold. \"My\r\nchildren--in the ravine--in the wood--near the little brook.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell, just as half a dozen soldiers rushed in, arms in hand; they met\r\nwith no resistance from the wounded man, whom they closely bound, and,\r\nafter some time, allowed the priest to dress his wound; but in spite of\r\nall his remarks on the danger of moving a man so severely wounded, they\r\nplaced him on a cart.\r\n\r\n\"Basta,\" said they, \"he can but die. He is the great robber, Don Josè\r\ndella Ribera.\" Josè thanked the good priest, by a motion of his head,\r\nthen asked for a glass of water, and as the priest stooped to put it to\r\nhis lips, he faintly said, \"You remember.\"\r\n\r\nThe curate replied with a nod, and when the troop had departed, in spite\r\nof the remonstrances of Margarita, who represented to him the danger of\r\ngoing out in the night, and the inutility of such a step, he quickly\r\ncrossed the wood toward the ravine, and there found the dead body of a\r\nwoman, killed, no doubt, by some stray shot from the guards. A baby lay\r\nat her breast, by her side a little boy of about four years old, who was\r\nendeavoring to wake her, pulling her by the sleeve, thinking she had\r\nfallen asleep, and calling her mamma. One may judge of Margarita's\r\nsurprise when the curate returned with two children on his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Santa Madre! What can this mean! What will you do in the night? We have\r\nnot even sufficient food for ourselves, and yet you bring two children. I\r\nmust go and beg from door to door, for them and ourselves. And who are\r\nthese children? The sons of a bandit--a gipsy; and worse, perhaps. Have\r\nthey ever been baptized?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the infant uttered a plaintive cry: \"What will you do to\r\nfeed this baby? we cannot afford a nurse; we must use the bottle, and you\r\nhave no idea of the wretched nights we shall have with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will sleep in spite of all,\" replied the good curate.\r\n\r\n\"O! santa Maria, he cannot be more than six months old! Happily I have a\r\nlittle milk here, I must warm it,\" and forgetting her anger, Margarita\r\ntook the infant from the priest, kissed it, and soothed it to rest. She\r\nknelt before the fire, stirred the embers to heat the milk quicker, and\r\nwhen this little one had had enough, she put him to sleep, and the other\r\nhad his turn. Whilst Margarita gave him some supper, undressed him, and\r\nmade him a bed for the night, of the priest's cloak, the good old man\r\nrelated to her how he had found the children; in what manner they had\r\nbeen bequeathed to him.\r\n\r\n\"O! that is fine and good,\" said Margarita, \"but how can they and we be\r\nfed?\"\r\n\r\nThe curate took the Bible, and read aloud--\r\n\r\n\"Whosoever shall give, even a cup of cold water, to one of the least,\r\nbeing a disciple; verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" responded the housekeeper.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the good father ordered the burial of the poor woman, and\r\nhe himself read the service over her grave.\r\n\r\nTwelve years from this time, the curate of San-Pedro, then seventy years\r\nof age, was warming himself in the sun, in front of his house. It was\r\nwinter, and there had been no sunshine for two days.\r\n\r\nBeside him stood a boy, ten or twelve years old, reading aloud the daily\r\nprayers, and from time to time casting a look of envy on a youth of about\r\nsixteen, tall, handsome, and muscular, who labored in the garden\r\nadjoining that of the priest. Margarita, being now blind, was listening\r\nattentively, when the youngest boy exclaimed, \"O! what a beautiful\r\ncoach,\" as a splendid equipage drove up near the door.\r\n\r\nA domestic, richly dressed, dismounted, and asked the old priest to give\r\nhim a glass of water for his master.\r\n\r\n\"Carlos,\" said the priest to the younger boy, \"give this nobleman a glass\r\nof water, and add to it a glass of wine, if he will accept it. Be quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman alighted from the coach. He seemed about fifty.\r\n\r\n\"Are the children your nephews?\" inquired he.\r\n\r\n\"Much better,\" said the priest, \"they are mine by adoption, be it\r\nunderstood.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell you, for I can refuse nothing to such a gentleman; for poor\r\nand inexperienced in the world as I am, I need good advice, how best to\r\nprovide for these two boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make ensigns of them in the king's guards, and in order to keep up a\r\nsuitable appearance, he must allow them a pension of six thousand\r\nducats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask your advice, my lord, not mockery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must have your church rebuilt, and by the side of it, a pretty\r\nparsonage house, with handsome iron railings to inclose the whole. When\r\nthis work will be complete, it shall be called the church of the _Vasa\r\nd'Agua_, (Glass of Water.) Here is the plan of it, will it suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"What vague remembrance is mine; these features--this voice mean that I\r\nam Don Josè della Ribera. Twelve years ago, I was the brigand Josè. I\r\nescaped from prison, and the times have changed; from the chief of\r\nrobbers, I have become the chief of a party. You befriended me. You have\r\nbeen a father to my children. Let them come to embrace me--let them\r\ncome,\" and he opened his arms to receive them. They fell on his bosom.\r\n\r\nWhen he had long pressed them, and kissed them by turns, with tears, and\r\nhalf-uttered expressions of gratitude, he held out his hand to the old\r\npriest--\r\n\r\n\"Well, my father, will you not accept the church?\"\r\n\r\nThe curate, greatly moved, turned to Margarita, and said: \"Whosoever\r\nshall give even a cup of cold water unto one of the least, being my\r\ndisciple; verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" responded the old dame, who wept for joy at the happiness of her\r\nmaster, and his children by adoption, at whose departure she also\r\ngrieved.\r\n\r\nTwelve months afterward, Don Josè della Ribera and his two sons attended\r\nat the consecration of the church of San Pedro, one of the prettiest\r\nchurches in the environs of Seville.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSONG--BY MISS JEWSBURY.\r\n\r\n  There once was a brave cavalier,\r\n    Commanded by Cupid to bow;\r\n  And his mistress, though lovely, I hear\r\n    Had a very Sultana-like brow;\r\n  In battles and sieges he fought\r\n    With many a Saracen Nero,\r\n  Till back to his mistress he brought\r\n    The fame and the heart of a hero:\r\n  But when he presumed to demand\r\n    The hero's reward in all story,\r\n  His mistress, in accents most bland--\r\n    Desired him to gather more glory\r\n                     Poor Camille!\r\n\r\n  So back went the young cavalier,\r\n    (Where dwells such obedience now?)\r\n  And he wove amid pennant and spear,\r\n    A wreath for that fair cruel brow;\r\n  How crimson the roses he sent,\r\n    But not with the summer sun's glow;\r\n  'Twas the crimson of battle--and lent\r\n    By a brave heart forever laid low!\r\n  Now if such a lover I knew,\r\n    And if I might be his adviser,\r\n  I would bid him be tender and true,\r\n    But certainly bid him be wiser.\r\n                     Poor Camille!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM PETRARCH.\r\n\r\n  Weeping for all my long lost years, I go,\r\n    And for that love which to this world confined\r\n    A spirit whose strong flight, for heaven designed,\r\n  No mean example might one man bestow.\r\n  Thou, who didst view my wonderings and my woe,\r\n    Great King of heaven! unseen, immortal mind!\r\n    Succor this weary being, frail and blind;\r\n  And may thy grace o'er all my failings flow!\r\n  Then, though my life through warring tempests passed;\r\n    My death may tranquilly and slowly come;\r\n  And my calm soul may flee in peace at last:\r\n    While o'er that space which shuts me from the tomb,\r\n  And on my death-bed, be thy blessing cast--\r\n    From Thee, in trembling hope, I wait my doom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[From Bentley's Miscellany]\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE WRECKER; AND THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY.\r\n\r\nA BRACE OF GHOST STORIES.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"THE EXPERIENCES OF A GAOL CHAPLAIN.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious summer's evening in July. The sun, robed in a thousand\r\nhues of gorgeous brilliancy, was setting behind the noble hill which\r\ntowers over the little hamlet of Shaldon; light pleasure-skiffs, with\r\ntiny sail, were dotted over the bay;[A] the ebb tide was gently laving\r\nthe hissing strand; and at intervals, wafted by the breeze, came from\r\nsome merry party afloat, a ringing, joyous laugh, or some slight snatch\r\nof song. It was an evening which breathed serenity and repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Teignmouth, Devon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated on one of the benches which skirt that pleasant promenade[B] were\r\ntwo feeble-looking men, with whom the summer of life had apparently\r\npassed. They conversed slowly and at intervals. That the theme interested\r\nboth was clear from the earnest tone of the one, and the attention\r\nrendered by the other. It was connected too in some way with the sea:\r\nfor, from time to time, the speaker paused and eyed wistfully the\r\nslumbering monster at his feet; and more than once the ejaculation was\r\naudible--\"the secret is buried there!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The Denne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And you believe this?\" said the listener, half incredulously, half\r\nrespectfully, when his elderly companion ceased.\r\n\r\n\"I do--firmly.\"\r\n\r\nThe other smiled, and then continued in a lower tone--\r\n\r\n\"All delusion! the result of a heated fancy--all delusion from beginning\r\nto end!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is delusion?\" said a tall military-looking figure, striding up and\r\njoining the group. \"We all have, at one period or other of our lives, to\r\nbattle with delusion and succumb to it. Now. sir,\" turning to the elder\r\ngentleman (his name was Ancelôt) and making a courteous bow--\"pray favor\r\nme with your case and symptoms.\"\r\n\r\nThe party addressed looked nettled, and replied--\r\n\r\n\"Mine was no delusion; it was a stern and solemn reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, give it what name you please,\" returned his companion, \"only let\r\nMajor Newburgh hear the tale as you narrated it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be again discredited? Excuse me, Trevor, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! but,\" interposed the major, \"I'm of a very confiding disposition. I\r\nbelieve everything and every body. The more extraordinary the narrative,\r\nthe more faith am I inclined to place in it. Trevor, there, as we all\r\nknow,\" added he, laughingly, \"has a twist. He's a 'total abstinence'\r\nman--a homeopathic man--a Benthamite, and secretly favors Mesmerism. With\r\nsuch abounding faith upon some points, we will allow him to be somewhat\r\nskeptical upon others. Come, your narrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the sober age of two-and-forty, a period when the season of delusion\r\nis pretty well over,\" said Mr. Ancelôt, pointedly, \"I found myself in\r\ncharge of a notorious fishing-village on the coast of Lincolnshire. It\r\nwas famous, or rather infamous, for the smuggling carried on in its\r\ncreeks, and for the vigilant and relentless wreckers which it numbered in\r\nits hovels. 'Rough materials!' said the bishop, Dr. Prettyman, when I\r\nwaited upon him to be licensed to the curacy--rough materials to work\r\nupon; but by care and diligence, Mr. Ancelôt, wondrous changes may be\r\neffected. Your predecessor, a feeble-minded man, gave but a sorry account\r\nof your flock; but under your auspices, I hope they will become a\r\nchurch-going and a church-loving people! Make them churchmen--you\r\nunderstand me? Make them churchmen!'... Heaven help me! They needed first\r\nto be made honest and temperate--to be humanized and Christianized!\r\n'Church-loving and church-going!' The chaplaincy of Newgate is not,\r\nperhaps, a sinecure; that of the Model Prison at Pentonville has,\r\nprobably, its hours of toil; and that attached to Horsemonger Lane is not\r\nentirely a bed of roses; but if you wish to wear a man's heart and soul\r\nout; to depress his spirits and prostrate his energies--if you would make\r\nhim long to exchange his lot with the day-laborer who whistles at the\r\nplow,--station him as a curate, far apart from his fellows, in a village\r\nmade up of prize-fighters, smugglers, and wreckers!\" To my lonely cure,\r\nwith a heavy heart, I went; and by a most reckless and rebellious crew I\r\nspeedily found myself surrounded--a crew which defied control.\r\nIntoxicating liquors of all kinds abounded. The meanest hovel smelt of\r\nspirits. Nor was there any want of contraband tobacco. Foreign luxuries,\r\nin a word, were rife among them. And yet they were always in want--always\r\ncraving from their clergyman temporal aid--in his spiritual capacity they\r\nwere slow to trouble him; had ever on their lips the entreaty\r\n'give'--'give;' and always protested that they 'were come to their\r\nfurthest, and had not a shilling in the world to help themselves withal.'\r\n\r\n\"For recklessness, drunkenness, and midnight brawls, all England could\r\nnot match that parish.\r\n\r\n\"To the general and prevailing aspect of poverty, there was one, and that\r\na marked exception. It presented itself in the person of Abigail\r\nLassiter--a widow--who was reputed to be wealthy, and with whose means,\r\nunscrupulously acquired, a tale of murder was strangely blended.\r\nAbigail's husband had been a smuggler, and she herself was a daring and\r\nkeen-eyed wrecker. For a season both throve. He had escaped detection in\r\nmany a heavy run of contraband goods; and she had come in for many a\r\nvaluable 'waif and stray' which the receding waters left upon the slimy\r\nstrand. It was, however, her last venture, which, in her neighbors'\r\nlanguage, _had made her_. Made her, indeed, independent of her fellows,\r\nbut a murderer before her God!... About day-break in a thick misty\r\nmorning in April, a vessel, heavily laden, was seen to ground on 'The\r\nJibber Sand;' and after striking heavily for some hours, suddenly to part\r\nasunder. The sea was so rough, and the wind so high, that no help could\r\nbe rendered from the shore. Midday drew on--came--passed, and the\r\nvillagers assembled on the heights (their eyes fixed the while on the\r\ndevoted vessel like vultures watching for their prey) had at length the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the laboring bark yield to the war of the\r\nelements, and her timbers float, piecemeal, over the waters.\r\n\r\n\"But nothing of any consequence came ashore. A stray spar or two,\r\na hen-coop, two or three empty barrels, a child's light straw hat, and a\r\nsailor's cap--these were all.\r\n\r\n\"The gale held: the wind blew off shore, and at nightfall the\r\nwrecking-party, hungry, weary, and out of humor, retired to their cabins.\r\nAbout an hour after midnight heavy rain fell; the wind shifted, and blew\r\ninshore. With the first appearance of dawn, Abigail's cottage door was\r\nseen slowly to unclose, and she herself to emerge from it, and stealthily\r\ncreep down to the shore. Once there, a steep sea-wall--thrown up to\r\nprotect the adjoining lowlands from inundation--screened her from\r\nobservation. She was absent about an hour, returned apparently\r\nempty-handed, reentered her cottage, nor passed its threshold again\r\nduring the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\n\"But that was a memorable day for the _industrious_. My villagers were\r\nearly astir. Their muddy shore was strewed with fragments of the wreck;\r\nand when the tide went down, and the gale moderated, half imbedded in the\r\nJibber Sand was found 'goodly spoil.' Packages of costly shawls, hampers\r\nof Dutch liqueurs, bales of linen, several kegs of brandy, and two small\r\ncanvas-bags containing bullion, were a few of the 'waifs and strays'\r\nwhich keen eyes speedily detected, and stalwart arms as speedily\r\nappropriated.\r\n\r\n\"Later on in the afternoon a very bustling personage made his appearance,\r\nmuch blown and overheated, who announced himself as 'acting under\r\nauthority from Lloyd's,' and 'representing the under-writers.' At his\r\nheels, uttering volleys of threats, and menacing every soul he met with\r\nhideous 'penalties according to act of parliament,' followed a very\r\nlady-like young gentleman, with a thin reedy voice, and light down upon\r\nhis chin, 'charged with protecting the public revenue.' Well for him in a\r\ndark night if he could protect himself!\r\n\r\n\"Worthy souls! They might as well have spared their well-fed nags, and\r\nhave remained at home snugly housed in their chimney-corner. ''Tis the\r\nearly bird that gets the worm.' They had missed it by hours. The spoil\r\nwas housed. It was buried in cottage gardens, and cabbages planted over\r\nit. It was secreted among the thatch, where even the best trained\r\nbird-nesting urchin would have missed it. It was stored away under more\r\nthan one hollow hearth-stone, on which a cheerful wood-fire was crackling\r\nand blazing. When were the 'womenkind' in a wrecker's village at a loss\r\nfor expedients?\r\n\r\n\"But a discovery was made that afternoon, which, for the moment, made the\r\nboisterous gentleman from Lloyd's falter in his denunciations, and hushed\r\nthe menaces of the indignant and well-dressed personage who protected the\r\nrevenue, and saddened the few hearts amongst us not entirely devoid of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n\"On a little knoll--called in memory of an unfortunate suicide, 'The Mad\r\nMaiden's Knoll,'--was found the body of a lady, youthful and fair, and by\r\nher side that of a little infant, a few weeks old. The babe, carefully\r\nswathed in countless warm wrappers, was lying in a rude cradle of\r\nwicker-work; this was firmly fastened to the lady's waist, who, on her\r\npart, had been securely lashed to a spar. 'Twas a piteous sight! But\r\none's sympathies were called into still more painful exercise when it was\r\nfound that the unfortunate lady's corpse had been rifled by some\r\nunprincipled marauder; that both ears had been torn, and two of her\r\nfingers had been crushed and broken in the attempt to plunder them of the\r\nrings with which they had been laden. Nor was this all. Every part of her\r\ndress had been carefully examined. Her stays had been ripped open, and a\r\npacket, assumed to be of value, had apparently been taken thence. What\r\nstrengthened this surmise was the fact that a fragment of a purple\r\nmorocco note-case still adhered to her dress. This fragment bore the\r\nwords in gilt letters, 'Bank Notes;' below were the initials 'F.H.B.' The\r\nsight drew forth general expressions of pity: but pity gave place to\r\nindignation when the district surgeon joined the group, and after a\r\ncareful examination of the body, said slowly, 'I suspect--I more than\r\nsuspect--I am almost positive, that this lady reached the shore alive.\r\nThe winds and waves have not destroyed her. She has perished by the hand\r\nof another. Look here,' and he pointed to a small dark rim round the\r\nneck, 'this is the effect of strangulation; and my belief is that the\r\ncorpse before us is that of _a murdered woman_.'\r\n\r\n\"The coroner of the district was summoned, a jury empanneled, and the\r\nsimple facts relative to the discovery of the bodies of the woman and\r\ninfant were briefly placed on record. Few cared to speak openly. All\r\nhad an interest in saying as little as possible. 'Return an open verdict,\r\ngentlemen; return an open verdict by all means,' suggested the wary\r\nofficial; 'that is the shortest course you can adopt; safe and perfectly\r\nlegal; it decides nothing, contradicts nothing, concludes nothing.' No\r\nadvice could be more palatable to the parties he addressed. 'Found dead,'\r\nwas the ready response; 'but by what means, drowning or otherwise; there\r\nis no evidence to show.'\r\n\r\n\"The coroner was delighted.\r\n\r\n\"'Precisely so; quite sufficient. My gig, and a glass of brandy and\r\nwater.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"No one claimed the bodies. Early interment was necessary; and a few\r\nhours after the inquest was concluded, mother and child were consigned to\r\ntheir parent earth.\r\n\r\n\"Six weeks afterward, an elderly man, with a most imperious manner and a\r\nforeign accent, came down to the village and asked countless questions\r\nrelative to the shipwreck. The unhappy lady, he said, was his niece; and\r\nearnest were the inquiries he made touching a large sum of money, which,\r\nto his certain knowledge, she had about her when she went on shipboard.\r\nOf this money, as a matter of course, no satisfactory tidings were\r\nforthcoming. He then became violent; called the village a nest of\r\npirates; cursed the inhabitants without mercy; hoped that heaven's\r\nlightnings would speedily fall, and raze the hamlet to the ground; and\r\nindulged in a variety of comments, some just, some foolish, and all\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\"But with all his anxiety about his niece, and all his burning\r\nindignation against her plunderers, he never visited the unhappy lady's\r\ngrave; never directed a stone to be placed over her; never deplored her\r\nfate; never uttered a remark about her infant, save and except an avowal\r\nof his unbounded satisfaction that it had perished with the mother-his\r\never-recurring subject of regret was, not that he had lost his niece, but\r\nthat he had lost her money!\r\n\r\n\"Oh world! how base are thy calculations, how sordid thy conclusions! The\r\nyoung, the fair, the helpless, the innocent may perish, it matters not.\r\nLoss of relatives, of children, of country, of character, all may be\r\nborne with complacency but--loss of money!\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the party who was suspected to have benefited most largely by\r\nthe shipwreck, went about her daily occupations with her usual subdued\r\nand poverty-stricken air. There was nothing in Abigail Lassiter's dress\r\nor manner to indicate the slightest improvement in her worldly\r\ncircumstances. She toiled as earnestly, dressed as simply, and lived as\r\nsparingly as ever. But quietly and almost imperceptibly a vast change was\r\nwrought in the aspect of her dwelling. It was carefully repaired and\r\nconsiderably enlarged, a small piece of pasture land was bought, and then\r\na handsome Alderney cow made her appearance. A garden of some extent, at\r\nthe rear of the cottage, was next laid out, and stocked, and last of all\r\na commodious spring cart and clever cob were seen on the little\r\nhomestead. But comfort there was none. An invisible hand fought against\r\nits inmates. Their career of success was closed. A curse and not a\r\nblessing was henceforth to track them. On a sudden the husband, Mark\r\nLassiter, was betrayed in one of his smuggling expeditions, encountered\r\nthe coast-guard where he least expected them, was fired at, captured, and\r\ndied in jail of his wounds. The eldest son--'Black Ben,' the\r\npugilist--killed his man, was accused of foul play, and compelled to fly\r\nthe country. Robin, second mate of a merchant vessel then lying in Hull\r\nDocks, still remained to her, and him she hastily summoned home for\r\ncounsel. Vain precaution! A final separation had already taken place\r\nbetween them. While wondering at his tardy movements, a brief unfeeling\r\nletter apprised her that, 'returning to his ship at midnight decidedly\r\nthe worse for liquor,' Robin Lassiter had missed his footing on the\r\nnarrow plank connecting the vessel with the shore, fallen into deep\r\nwater, and had sunk to rise no more.\r\n\r\n\"These successive bereavements paralyzed her. For the first time the idea\r\nseems to have presented itself, that it was possible adversity might\r\noverwhelm her. She confined herself rigidly to her home; said that _the\r\nmoan of the sea wearied and worried her_, and blocked up every window\r\nwhich _looked upon the ocean!_ For hours she would sit, abstractedly, in\r\nsilence. Then, wringing her hands, would wake up with a wistful cry, and\r\nrepeat--'Wrong never comes right! Wrong never comes right!'\r\n\r\n\"Much as I knew she hated religion, its ministers, its sanctuary, and\r\nevery object which, by possibility, could remind her that _there was a\r\ncoming future_, I yet felt it my duty to make another and a third attempt\r\nat an interview. She received me ungraciously enough, but not insolently.\r\nHer fair, soft, feminine features betrayed evident annoyance at my visit,\r\nbut still there was an absence of that air of menace and hatred which\r\ncharacterized her in former days.\r\n\r\n\"'You visit me?' was her inquiry; 'why?'\r\n\r\n\"'To condole with you on the ravages which death has made in your\r\nfamily.'\r\n\r\n\"Her reply was instant and firmly uttered.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; two are gone. Their part is played and over. I presume they are at\r\nrest.'\r\n\r\n\"A passing remark followed, in which a hope was expressed that I should\r\nsee her at church.\r\n\r\n\"'Never, until I'm brought there. I shouldn't know myself in such a\r\nplace, nor would those who assemble there know me.'\r\n\r\n\"While framing my reply she continued--\r\n\r\n\"'Your visit, sir, is wholly unexpected; I have never troubled the\r\nclergy, and I hope they will not trouble me; I have my sorrows, and I\r\nkeep them to myself.'\r\n\r\n\"'They will overwhelm you unless aid be granted--'\r\n\r\n\"She interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\"'I seek it not, and therefore have no right to expect it. But why should\r\nI detain you sir,' said she, rising from her seat; 'there are others who\r\nmay prize your presence more than I do.'\r\n\r\n\"One of Wilson's little volumes was in my hand. I proffered it with the\r\nremark--'You will perhaps read this in my absence?'\r\n\r\n\"She declined it with a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\"'No! no! I seldom read, and my hourly endeavor _now_ is not to think!\r\nThis way lies your road, sir. Farewell.'\r\n\r\n\"A more thoroughly unsatisfactory interview it is scarcely possible to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n\"Two years had rolled away, when, one morning, a message reached me that\r\n'Dame Lassiter was ill,' and wished I would 'call in the course of the\r\nday.' Within the hour came another summons: 'Dame Lassiter was much\r\nworse,' and begged to 'see me without delay.' Before midday I was at the\r\ncottage. Her sole attendant,--a bold, saucy, harsh looking girl of\r\neighteen,--awaited me at the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"'Right glad am I you're come,' was her greeting; 'the mistress, sir, has\r\nbeen asking for you ever since day-break.'\r\n\r\n\"'She is worse then?'\r\n\r\n\"She lowered her voice to a whisper, and continued:--\r\n\r\n\"'She's going! She'll not hold it long. The doctors have given her up,\r\nand there's no more medicine to be gone for. This last is a sure sign.'\r\n\r\n\"'Is she sensible?'\r\n\r\n\"The girl hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"'_In_ times she be,' was her reply, rather doubtfully given! 'in times\r\nshe be; but there's something about her I don't quite fancy; the plain\r\nfact is, she's rather _quair_, and I shall go up to the village. You'll\r\nnot mind being alone, I dare say?'\r\n\r\n\"And without waiting for a reply this careful and considerate attendant\r\nhurriedly opened the door; went out; and then locked it briskly and\r\nfirmly on the outside. I was a prisoner, and my companion a dying woman!\r\nFor the moment I felt startled; but a hollow moan of anguish, sadly and\r\npainfully reiterated in the chamber above, at once recalled me to my\r\nduties, and bade me seek the sufferer. In a room of fair dimensions lay,\r\nstricken and emaciated, the once active and dauntless Abigail. On\r\nentering I could with difficulty disguise my surprise at the variety\r\nof articles which it contained, and at the costliness and splendor of\r\nmany of them. The curtains of the sick woman's bed were of figured silk\r\ndamask; and though here and there a dark spot was visible where\r\nsea-water, or some other destructive agency, had penetrated, enough still\r\nremained to vindicate the richness of the fabric and the brilliancy of\r\nthe color. The linen on the bed was of the finest texture, apparently the\r\nproduction of a Dutch loom, while the vessel which held her night-drink\r\nwas an antique goblet, indisputably of foreign workmanship,--its\r\nmaterials silver and mother-of-pearl. Under the window, which commanded\r\nher flower garden, stood a small work-table of birds'-eye maple, which\r\nmethought had once stood in the lady's cabin of some splendidly appointed\r\nsteamer. Her wash-stand was of mahogany richly carved: on the shelf above\r\nit stood an ebony writing-desk, inlaid with silver; below was a lady's\r\ndressing case--ivory--and elaborately carved. Two cases of foreign birds\r\nof exquisite plumage completed the decoration of the apartment. It is\r\ntrue necessitous sailors and carousing smugglers might have contributed\r\nsome of the costly articles I saw around me; but as I gazed on them the\r\nthought recurred, are not these the wages of iniquity? Have they not been\r\nrifled from the grasp of the helpless, the drowning, and the dying?\r\n\r\n\"I spoke. She was in full possession of her faculties; but manifestly\r\nnear her end. I expressed my sorrow at finding her so feeble; told her\r\nthat I had readily obeyed her summons; and asked her whether I should\r\nread to her.\r\n\r\n\"'Neither read to me,' was her distinct reply: 'nor pray with me; but\r\nlisten to me. They tell me I have not many hours to live. If so, I have\r\nsomething to disclose; and some money which I should wish--I should\r\nwish'--she hesitated and became silent--'the point is, am I beyond\r\nrecovery? If so I should desire that this money--'\r\n\r\n\"'Under any circumstances,' was my reply, 'confess all; restore all'\r\n\r\n\"She looked up quickly and said sharply; 'Why restore?'\r\n\r\n\"'To prove the sincerity of your regrets.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, well!' said she, thoughtfully, 'if I could only satisfy myself that\r\nrecovery was impossible. I have much to leave behind me; and there are\r\nsome circumstances--'\r\n\r\n\"She hesitated and was silent. A minute or two elapsed and I urged--\r\n\r\n\"'Be candid and be just,--make reparation while you possess the power.'\r\n\r\n\"'You advise well,' said she, faintly. 'I would fain relieve my mind. It\r\nis sorely oppressed, for with regard to my property--my--my savings--'\r\n\r\n\"As she spoke there arose, close to us, clear and painfully audible, a\r\nlow, mocking laugh. It was not akin to mirth. There was no gladness in\r\nits tone. It betokened enmity, triumph, scorn. The dying woman heard it,\r\nand cowered beneath its influence. An expression of agonizing fear passed\r\nover her countenance. Some minutes elapsed before she could sufficiently\r\ncommand herself to speak or even listen.\r\n\r\n\"'Carry out forthwith,' said I, in a tone of resolution I could with\r\ndifficulty command, 'carry out your present determination. Make\r\nrestitution to the utmost of your power. Restore all; confess all.'\r\n\r\n\"'I will do so and now,' was her reply.\r\n\r\n\"Again that bitter, scornful, chilling laugh; and closer to us! To no\r\nebullition of any earthly emotion can I compare it. It resembled none. It\r\nconveyed scorn, exultation, defiance, hatred. It seemed an uncontrollable\r\nburst of triumph over a parting and ruined soul. Again, I gazed\r\nsteadfastly on the dying woman. A spasm convulsed her countenance. She\r\npointed feebly to some unseen object--unseen at least by me--and\r\nclasped her hands with an imploring gesture. Another spasm came on-a\r\nsecond-a third--and all was silence. I was _alone_ with the dead.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And you are persuaded that these sounds were real and not fanciful, that\r\nimagination had nothing to do with the scene?\" said the younger of the\r\nthree when the aged speaker had concluded.\r\n\r\nThe reply was immediate.\r\n\r\n\"I state simply what I heard; that, and no more. No opportunity for trick\r\nexisted. The cottage had one door, _and but one_. The dying woman and\r\nmyself were the only parties within its walls. We were locked in from\r\nwithout: until the attendant returned and unclosed the door there was no\r\npossibility of either entering or quitting the dwelling. I was alone with\r\nthe dead for upward of an hour--no enviable vigil--when it pleased her\r\nunfeeling and gossiping retainer to return and release me. Believe it,\r\nsay you? I do believe it--and most firmly--as fact and not fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what say you, Major?\" pursued the questioner, turning to his\r\nmilitary companion.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it also, and the more readily from recollecting what once\r\noccurred to myself. Soon after my awkward hit at Vittoria, where I\r\nreceived a bullet, which I carry about with me to this hour, I was\r\nordered home on sick leave. Landing at Falmouth from a filthy transport,\r\nfeeble, feverish, solitary and wretched, I was recognized by a former\r\nintimate, who followed me to my inn and insisted upon taking me down with\r\nhim into ----shire. Rest and country air, he was sure, would recruit me.\r\nIn vain I explained the wretched cripple I was. In vain I submitted that\r\nthe 'hospital mates,' one and all, entertained the worst opinion of my\r\ninjury. He would take no denial. It was a case, he contended, not for the\r\nknife or the doctor; but for beef-steaks and Barclay's stout. And this\r\nopinion he would make good, in my instance, against the whole hospital\r\nstaff at home and abroad. Too weak to contest the point, I gave in; and\r\npromised that, if living, that day week should find me at ---- House. The\r\nfirst part of my journey I made out with comparatively little suffering.\r\nThe latter part, where I was obliged to have recourse to a hack chaise,\r\nneither wind nor weather tight--ill hung, and badly driven, was torture.\r\nAt length, unable to endure longer agony, I got out; and bidding the\r\npostboy drive with my luggage to ---- House, limped along across the\r\nfields under the pilotage of an old laborer--it was a work of time--to my\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n\"My gray-haired guide, who commiserated my situation, was very\r\ninquisitive about 'the war and Lord Wellington;' asked whether _all_ the\r\nSpaniards lived on 'mules' flesh fried with onions,' as he 'had been told\r\nfor truth;' inquired what 'our side' thought of 'Boney's covenant with\r\nthe devil,' a covenant, (according to his reading,) to this effect, that\r\n'the devil had given Boney _a lease of luck_ for threescore and three\r\nyears, and that when it was up he was to be shot by a Spanish maiden with\r\na silver bullet.' Many folks, he said, believed all this to be true and\r\n_sartain_; but that he, for his part, 'did not _hold_ with it: what did I\r\nthink?' But however talkative about the war, my venerable pilot was\r\nreserved about ---- House. I asked him if he knew it. 'These fifty years\r\nand more,' was his answer. 'The House of Mystery; good people live there\r\nnow,--yes, good people, kind people,--a blessed change for all about and\r\naround the House of Mystery. More he would not utter. At length I reached\r\nthe winning post, hobbled in, received a cordial welcome, and retired\r\nearly to bed.\r\n\r\n\"None but those who have lain for weeks in a crowded military hospital,\r\nwho have battled day by day with death, now flushed with fever, now\r\nracked with agonizing spasmodic action in every nerve, can conceive the\r\neffect of the quiet, the pure air, the bracing freshness of the country.\r\nThe stillness which reigned around,--the peaceful landscape beneath my\r\nwindow,--the balmy fragrance of the flowers,--the hush of woods reposing\r\nin all the stillness of a summer's twilight,--the faint tinkling of the\r\ndistant sheep-bell,--the musical murmur of the rill which gurgled gaily\r\nand gladly from beneath the base of the sun-dial,--the deer dotted over\r\nthe park, and grazing lazily in groups beneath the branching oaks, made\r\nup a picture which soothed and calmed me. I went to bed satisfied that _I\r\nshould sleep_. I did so without a single twinge till after midnight. Then\r\nI was roused by a grating sound at a distance. It drew nearer, became\r\nmore and more distinct, and presently at a pelting pace, up drove a\r\ncarriage and four. I say four, because a man used to horses all his life,\r\ncan, by their tramp, judge, though blindfold, pretty accurately as to\r\ntheir numbers. I heard the easy roll of the carriage, the grating of the\r\nwheels on the gravel, the sharp pull-up at the main entrance, the\r\nimpatient pawing of the animals on the hard and well-rolled road. All\r\nthis I caught most distinctly. But though I listened keenly I heard no\r\nbell ring, no door unclose, no servant hasten to these new arrivals. I\r\nthought it odd. I struck my repeater. 'A quarter to one. Strange hour,\r\nsurely, for visitors to arrive! However, no business of mine. I have not,\r\nhappily, to rise and do the honors.' And, after a yawn or two, and a\r\nhurried, though I trust grateful acknowledgment for the comparative ease\r\nI was enjoying, I turned upon my side and dozed off. I had slept about\r\ntwo hours when a similar noise again aroused me. Up came another carriage\r\nat the same slapping pace. Pat, pat, pat, went the hoofs upon the hard\r\navenue. The wheels rattled; the gravel grated on the ear; there was the\r\nsame quick, sharp, knowing pull-up at the main door, and the same\r\nimpatient stamp of high-fed steeds anxious to be off, and eager for the\r\nrest and feed of the stable. I became irritated and angry. 'A pretty\r\nhouse,' said I, 'for an invalid! Guests arriving at all hours! Moreover,\r\na precious lot of fresh faces shall I have to encounter at the breakfast\r\ntable. A nice figure I am! My walk particularly straight and lively! I\r\nshall be \"the observed of all observers\" with a vengeance. I wish with\r\nall my soul I had remained at Exeter. I had there my hospitable friends,\r\nthe Greens, in \"the Barn-field,\" to keep an eye to me, while _here_,\r\ncarriages are driving up at a splitting pace from midnight to\r\ncock-crowing.' And fuming and fretting, chafed and annoyed, I lay\r\nfeverish and discontented till daybreak.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, having taken peculiar pains with my toilet, and having\r\narrived at the inevitable conclusion that I hobbled worse than ever, and\r\nwas as infirm as an old gentleman of eighty, I presented myself in the\r\nbreakfast room.\r\n\r\n\"I expected to find it lined with fresh faces. I was mistaken. The party\r\nassembled was the same, without diminution or addition, which I had\r\nquitted the preceding evening. After an interchange of civilities I\r\nhazarded an inquiry:--\r\n\r\n\"'Where are the new arrivals?'\r\n\r\n\"'There are no new arrivals,' said my hostess; 'I hope you are not tired\r\nof us already?'\r\n\r\n\"'You allude to an utter impossibility,' was my rejoinder; 'but beyond\r\nall doubt two carriages drove up to the main entrance early this\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are our only guest,' observed my hostess with an air of peculiar\r\ngravity, and even perceptible annoyance in her manner.\r\n\r\n\"'You see us as we are, a quiet family party, Mr. Newburgh,' observed the\r\nyoungest daughter hastily, and then adroitly changed the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' thought I, 'I'm on unsafe ground. Some disagreeable people,\r\nself-invited, and dismissed at all hazards. Very well. _Moi c'est égal!_\r\nWhat concern have I with the family arrangements of another?'\r\n\r\n\"The second night of my visit drew on. I slept well and soundly till\r\nabout three in the morning, when my slumbers were suddenly broken by a\r\nrapid rush of horsemen across the lawn, directly under my dressing-room\r\nwindow. 'Hunting at three in the morning is a rank absurdity,' was my\r\ncomment; 'but if I ever heard the sound of horses and horsemen I did\r\nthen. The park gates must have been left open, and the farm horses have\r\nbroken loose. Utter destruction to the lawn, and to the flower beds, and\r\nthe glorious rhododendrons! What negligent menials.' And while murmuring\r\nmy abhorrence of such atrocious carelessness, and my deep regret at its\r\nresults, my eyes closed. The next morning I peeped with apprehension from\r\nmy window, on what I presumed would prove a scene of devastation. All was\r\nfair and smiling, gaze where I would. Here was the trim and smoothly\r\nshaven lawn--there the blooming parterre--beyond the early flowering\r\nshrubs not a twig, not a leaf injured. I left my room in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Below, the papers had arrived. They gave the details of another and\r\ndecisive battle. _That_, and an expedition during the morning to a\r\nneighboring Roman encampment, banished the horsemen of the preceding\r\nnight, nor did they recur till I found myself in my room, exhausted and\r\nbent down with pain, at eleven. The fact was I had played the fool and\r\noverwalked myself, and my avenger, the bullet, began to remind me of his\r\npresence in my system. For three mortal hours no poor wretch, save in his\r\ndeath struggle, endured greater agony than I did. At last, a 'compassion\r\nthat never faileth,' bestowed on me an interval of ease, and I slept.\r\nHeavily, I imagine, since for some time a strange booming noise droned\r\ncontinuously in my ears before it waked me. At last I was roused. I\r\nlistened. The sound was like nothing I had ever heard before. It seemed\r\nas if a heavy-sledge hammer, or huge wooden mallet, carefully muffled in\r\nwadding, was at work in the room _below me_. The stable clock struck\r\nfour. 'No mason,' thought I, 'no mason would commence his day's work at\r\nfour in the morning. Burglars, perhaps,' and I resolved to give alarm.\r\nThe noise suddenly ceased, and some three minutes afterward as suddenly\r\nrecommenced in the children's play-room immediately _above me_. 'Be they\r\nwhom they may they shall be disturbed.' And I began to dress in the dark\r\nwith all possible expedition. Some partial progress was made when the\r\nnoise ceased in the upper room and descended forthwith to my own. An\r\ninstant afterward it seemed to proceed from the library. In about twenty\r\nminutes it ceased altogether.\r\n\r\n\"'No mason, no burglar,' was my conclusion. 'This noise has nothing in\r\ncommon with either the one or the other. Did my old guide speak\r\naccurately when he called this \"The House of Mystery?\" Whether it be such\r\nor no, it is not the house for me. I can't sleep in it. I must flit; and\r\nI will do so with the morning's light.'\r\n\r\n\"But with the morning's light came bright and cheerful faces, kindly\r\ninquiries, and renewed hospitality, and with them an abandonment of my\r\nmenaced departure. During the day an opportunity presented itself of\r\nmentioning to my young host the harassing disturbances of the night, and\r\nasking for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"'I can give none,' was his reply: 'after many years residence in the\r\nhouse, and ceaseless endeavors to ascertain the cause of these\r\nannoyances, you are as much _au fait_ of their origin as myself.'\r\n\r\n\"'Is their[*sic] no motive, adequate or inadequate,' I continued, 'which\r\ncan be assigned for these nightly visitations?'\r\n\r\n\"'None beyond the tradition--apparently authentic--that an ancestor of\r\nours, a man whose character will not bear investigation, met his death,\r\nunfairly, in an old house on the site of which this is built. He was a\r\nmiser, and presumed to be extremely wealthy. He lived secluded from\r\nsociety; his factotum and agent being an Italian valet, who was perfectly\r\naware of the ample means of his master. On a sudden my vicious kinsman\r\ndisappeared, and shortly afterward the valet. But the story\r\nruns--tradition it must still be called--that the former was robbed,\r\nbrutally beaten, and finally _walled up_ in some recess by his desperate\r\nretainer. So immured he died of actual starvation; but according to the\r\nlegend, much of the miser's wealth continued hidden about the mansion\r\nwhich the Italian's fears prevented his carrying off, and which still\r\nremains, snug and safe, in some dusty repository, ready to reward \"a\r\nfortunate speculator.\" I only wish,' continued he merrily, 'I could light\r\nupon the hoard! Give me a clew, dear Newburgh, and I'll buy you a troop.'\r\n\r\n\"'At any rate,' said I, 'from the mirth with which you treat it, the\r\nvisitation is not unpleasant.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are in error,' said my entertainer; 'the subject is unquestionably\r\nannoying, and one which my mother and the family studiously avoid. As for\r\nyour bed-room--the porch-room--I am aware that parties occupying it have\r\noccasionally heard the strangest noises on the gravel-walk immediately\r\nbelow them. Your hostess was most averse to those quarters being assigned\r\nyou; but I thought that the room being large and lofty, and the steps to\r\nit few, you would occupy it with comfort. I am grieved that my\r\narrangement has proved disagreeable.' And then, finishing off with a\r\nhearty laugh, in which, for the life of me I couldn't join, my host\r\nadded, '_if he be walled up_, I am sure you will say, Newburgh, that he's\r\na persevering old gentleman, and makes the most laudable efforts to get\r\nout of his cell.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The levity of some persons,\" was the major's grave aside, \"how\r\ninconceivable, how indescribable!\"\r\n\r\n\"My visit,\" continued he, \"lasted about a fortnight, during the whole of\r\nwhich period, at intervals, the rapping was audible in different parts of\r\nthe house. It appeared to me however--I watched attentively--to come with\r\nthe greatest frequency from the hall. Thence it sounded as if an immense\r\nmallet, muffled in feathers or cotton, was striking heavily on the floor.\r\nThe noise was generally heard between twelve and two. The blows sometimes\r\nfollowed each other with great rapidity; at other times more slowly and\r\nleisurely. One singularity of the visitation was this--that in whatever\r\npart of the house you might be listening, the noise seemed to come from a\r\nremote direction. If you heard the blows in the drawing-room, they\r\nappeared to be given in the library. And if you heard them in the\r\nlibrary, they seemed to be falling in the nursery. The invisible workman\r\nwas busy always _at a distance_. Another feature was its locomotive\r\npowers. It moved with the most extraordinary rapidity. Nothing that I\r\ncould think of--mice, rats, drains, currents of air, dropping of\r\nwater--would explain it. If the noise had been caused by the agency of\r\nany one of these causes, it would have been heard in the day time. _It\r\nnever was_. Night was the season, and the only season in which the\r\nponderous, but invisible, mallet was wielded. Nothing could exceed the\r\nkindness with which I was treated. No words can do justice to the\r\nthoughtful and delicate hospitality which I received. But I declare to\r\nyou this mysterious visitation was too much for me. It was impossible to\r\nlisten to it at night without depression. Perhaps my nerves were\r\nunstrung. The tone of my system might be enfeebled. The fault, I dare\r\nsay, was in myself. But to lie awake, as I often did, during long hours\r\nfrom pain, and to hear this muffled, hollow, droning, mysterious noise\r\npassing from room to room about the house--to listen to it now above me,\r\nnow below me, now quite close to my chamber door, and in a couple of\r\nseconds rising up from the very center of the hall, and to be all the\r\nwhile utterly unable to account for it, fevered me. I curtailed my visit;\r\nbut the nursing and kindness I received are graven in my memory. Bearing\r\nall these matters in remembrance,\" said the major firmly; \"recollecting\r\nmy own strange experience, how can I discredit Mr. Ancelôt's narrative?\r\n_I firmly believe it_. We are surrounded by mysteries. The invisible\r\nworld enshrouds us. Spirits have their regards intently fixed on us, and\r\na very slight vail divides us. Spurn the vulgar error,\" said the old\r\nveteran stoutly, \"that a soldier must be a scoffer. I remember the holy\r\nrecord, and its thrilling declaration; 'We are a spectacle unto angels\r\nand unto men.'\" A pause ensued, which neither of the listeners cared to\r\nterminate. At length he spoke again. \"The dews are falling. The last\r\npleasure-boat has landed its fair freight upon the Denne.

NEWTON CROSLAND.\r\n\r\n  \"With clamourous demands of debt, broken bonds,\r\n   And the detention of long due debts,\r\n   Against my honor.\"--TIMON OF ATHENS\r\n\r\n  \"How in the turmoil of life can love stand,\r\n   Where there is not one heart, and one mouth, and one hand?\"\r\n   LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\nIn a charming morning-room of a charming London house, neighboring\r\nHyde-Park, there lounged over the breakfast-table a wedded pair,--the\r\nrich merchant Farrars, and his young wife, the Lady Lucy. Five years of\r\nmarried life had, in most respects, more than realized the brightest\r\nhopes which had been born and cherished in the dreaming days of\r\ncourtship. Till the age of forty, the active mind of Walter Ferrars had\r\nbeen chiefly occupied by business,--not in mean shuffling, speculative\r\ndealings, but on the broad basis of large transactions and an almost\r\nchivalrous system of integrity.\r\n\r\nThen, when a secured position and the privileges of wealth had introduced\r\nhim to that inner circle of English society which not wealth _alone_ can\r\npenetrate, but where wealth in some due proportion is an element\r\nnecessary to hold fast a place, it was thought most natural and proper\r\nthat he should choose a wife from the class which seems set apart from\r\nthe rest of womankind like the choice flowers of a conservatory, on whom\r\nno rude breath must blow. The youthful, but nearly portionless, daughter\r\nof a poor Earl seemed the very bride decreed by some good angel for the\r\nmerchant-prince.\r\n\r\nBut though the nuptials fulfilled nearly all the requirements of a\r\n_mariage de convenance_, there was in reality very much more of the\r\ningredients in their hearts which amalgamate into very genuine \"love,\"\r\nthan always meet at the altar; though of course \"the World\" resolutely\r\nrefused to believe anything of the sort--the World, which is capable of\r\nso much kindness, and goodness, and justice, among its individuals, taken\r\n\"separately and singly,\" and yet is such a false, malignant, many-headed\r\nmonster in its corporate body! Walter Ferrars had a warm heart, that\r\nyearned for affection, as well as a clear head; and, fascinated as he had\r\nbeen by the youthful grace and beauty, the high-bred repose of manner and\r\ncultivated talents of the Lady Lucy, he set himself resolutely to win and\r\nkeep her girlish heart, not expecting that the man of forty was to obtain\r\nit without an effort. Thus, when he assumed a husband's name, he did not\r\n\"drop the lover.\" His was still the watchful care, made up of the\r\nthousand little thoughtful kindnesses of daily life, neither relaxed in a\r\n_tête-à-tête_, nor increased in public. He was the pleased and ready\r\nescort for every occasion, save only when some imperative business\r\nclaimed his time and presence; and these calls now were rare, for he had\r\nlong since arrived at the position when efficient servants and assistants\r\ncarry out the plans a superior has organized.\r\n\r\nIs there wonder that the wife was grateful? Few--few women indeed are\r\ninsensible to the power of continued kindness; they may have a heart of\r\nstone for the impetuous impulsive lover, but habitual tenderness-that\r\nseems so unselfish--touches the finest chords of their nature, and\r\nawakens affection that might have lain dormant through a long life, but\r\nfor this one sweet influence. Thus it was that the wife of five years\r\nloved her husband with an almost adoring worship. She had felt her own\r\nmind expand in the intimate communion with his fine intellect; she had\r\nfelt her own weaknesses grow less, as if she had absorbed some of his\r\nstrength of character; and she had recognised the very dawn of principles\r\nand opinions which had been unknown to her in the days of her\r\nthoughtless, ignorant, inexperienced girlhood. And yet with all her love,\r\nwith all her matured intelligence, she had never lost a certain awe of\r\nher husband, which his seniority had perhaps first implanted, and alas!\r\none fatal circumstance had gone far to render morbid.\r\n\r\nThey sat at breakfast. It was early spring, and though the sunshine\r\nstreamed through the windows, and from one of them there crept the odors\r\nof the conservatory, a bright fire gleamed and crackled in the grate; and\r\nshed a charm of cheerfulness through the room. Mr. Ferrars had a\r\nnewspaper in his hand, but not yet had he perused a line, for his son and\r\nheir, a brave boy of three years old, a very model of patrician beauty,\r\nwas climbing his large chair, playing antics of many sorts, and even\r\naffecting to pull his father's still rich and curling hair, so little awe\r\nhad the young Walter of the head of the house--while Mr. Farrars'\r\nparental glee was like a deep bass to the child's crowing laugh. Lady\r\nLucy smiled too, but she shook her head, and said more than once,\r\n\"Naughty papa is spoiling Watty.\" It was a pretty scene; the room was\r\nredolent of elegance, and the young mother, in her exquisitely simple but\r\ntasteful morning dress, was one of its chief ornaments. Who would think\r\nthat beneath all this sweetness of life there was still a serpent!\r\n\r\nA post was just in, and a servant entered with several letters; among\r\nthose delivered to Lady Lucy were two or three large unsightly,\r\nill-shaped epistles, that seemed strange company for the others. An\r\nobserving stranger might have noticed that Lady Lucy's cheek paled, and\r\nthen flushed; that she crushed up her letters together, without\r\nimmediately opening them, and that presently she slid the ugly ones into\r\nthe pocket of her satin apron. Mr. Ferrars read his almost with a\r\nglance--for they were masculine letters, laconic, and to the point,\r\nconveying necessary information, in three lines and a half--and he\r\nsmiled, as after a while he observed his wife apparently intent on a\r\ntruly feminine epistle--four sides of delicate paper closely crossed--and\r\nexclaimed gaily:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lucy, there's an hour's reading for you, at least; so I shall\r\nring and send Watty to the nursery, and settle steadily to the _Times_.\"\r\n\r\nBut though Lady Lucy really perused the letter, her mind refused to\r\nretain the pleasant chit-chat gossip it contained. Her thoughst[*sic]\r\nwere far away, and had she narrowly examined her motives she would have\r\nknown that she bent over the friendly sheet chiefly as an excuse for\r\nsilence, and to conceal her passing emotions. Meanwhile the newspaper\r\ncrackled in her husband's hand as he moved its broad leaves.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Ferrars started with an exclamation of grief and\r\nastonishment that completely roused his absent wife.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Walter, what has happened?\" she asked, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"A man a bankrupt, whom I thought as safe as the Bank of England. Though\r\nit is true people talked about him months ago--spoke suspiciously of his\r\npersonal extravagance, and, above all, said that his wife was ruining\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"His wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes;--but I cannot understand that sort of thing. A few hundreds a year\r\nmore or less could be of little moment to a man like Beaufort, and I\r\ndon't suppose she spent more than you do, my darling. At any rate she was\r\nnever better dressed. Yet I believe the truth was, that she got\r\nfrightfully into debt unknown to him; and debt is a sort of thing that\r\nmultiplies itself in a most astonishing manner, and sows by the wayside\r\nthe seeds of all sorts of misery. Then people say that when pay-day came\r\nat last, bickerings ensued, their domestic happiness was broken up.\r\nBeaufort grew reckless, and plunged into the excitement of the maddest\r\nspeculations.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" murmured Lady Lucy.\r\n\r\n\"Dreadful, indeed! I don't know what I should do with such a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would not you forgive her if you loved her very much?\" asked Lady Lucy,\r\nand she spoke in the singularly calm tone of suppressed emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Once, perhaps, once; and if her fault were the fault of youthful\r\ninexperience,--but so much falseness, mean deception, and mental\r\ndeterioration must have accompanied such transactions, that--in short, I\r\nthank Heaven that I have never been put to the trial.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the eyes of Mr. Farrars were fixed on the leading article of\r\nthe _Times_, not on his wife. Presently Lady Lucy glided from the room,\r\nwithout her absence being at the moment observed. Once in her\r\ndressing-room she turned the key, and sinking into a low chair, gave vent\r\nto her grief in some of the bitterest tears she had ever shed. She, too,\r\nwas in debt; \"frightfully,\" her husband had used the right word;\r\n\"hopelessly,\" so far as satisfying her creditors even out of the large\r\nallowance Mr. Farrars made her; and still she had not the courage\r\nvoluntarily to tell the truth, which yet she knew must burst upon him ere\r\nlong. From what small beginnings had this Upas shadow come upon her! And\r\nwhat \"falseness, mean deception, and mental deterioration\" had truly been\r\nhers!\r\n\r\nEven the fancied relief of weeping was a luxury denied to her, for she\r\nfeared to show the evidence of tears; thus after a little while she\r\nstrove to drive them back, and by bathing her face before the glass, and\r\ndrawing the braids of her soft hair a little nearer her eyes, she was\r\ntolerably successful in hiding their trace. Never, when dressing for\r\ncourt or gala, had she consulted her mirror so closely; and now, though\r\nthe tears were dried; she was shocked at the lines of anguish--those\r\ndelvers of the wrinkles of age--which marked her countenance. She sat\r\nbefore her looking-glass, one hand supporting her head, the other\r\nclutching the hidden letters which she had not yet the courage to open.\r\nThere was a light tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" inquired Lady Lucy.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, my lady,\" replied Harris, her faithful maid. \"Madame Dalmas is\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lucy unlocked her door and gave orders that the visitor should be\r\nshown up. With the name had come a flush of hope that some trifling\r\ntemporary help would be hers. Madame Dalmas called herself a\r\nFrench-woman, and signed herself \"Antoinette,\" but she was really an\r\nEnglish Jewess of low extraction, whose true name was Sarah Solomons.\r\nHer \"profession\" was to purchase--and sell--the cast-off apparel of\r\nladies of fashion; and few of the sisterhood have carried the art of\r\ndouble cheating to so great a proficiency. With always a roll of bank\r\nnotes in her old leathern pocket-book, and always a dirty canvas bag full\r\nof bright sovereigns in her pocket, she had ever the subtle temptation\r\nfor her victims ready.\r\n\r\nMadame Dalmas--for she must be called according to the name engraved on\r\nher card--was a little meanly-dressed woman of about forty, with bright\r\neyes and a hooked nose, a restless shuffling manner, and an ill-pitched\r\nvoice. Her jargon was a mixture of bad French and worse English.\r\n\r\n\"Bon jour, miladi Lucy,\" she exclaimed, as she entered Lady Lucy's\r\nsanctum, \"need not inquire of health, you look si charmante. Oh, si\r\nbelle!--that make you wear old clothes so longer dan oder ladies, and\r\nhave so leetel for me to buy. Milady Lucy Ferrars know she look well in\r\nanything, but yet she should not wear old clothes: no right--for\r\nexample--for de trade, and de hoosband always like de wife well\r\ndressed--ha--ha!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Lady Lucy! Too sick at heart to have any relish for Madame Dalmas'\r\nnauseous compliments, and more than half aware of her cheats and\r\nfalsehoods, she yet tolerated the creature from her own dire necessities.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Madame Dalmas,\" she said, \"I am dreadfully in want of money;\r\nbut I really don't know what I have for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"De green velvet, which you not let me have before Easter, I still give\r\nyou four pounds for it, though perhaps you worn it very much since then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only twice--only seven times in all--and it cost me twenty guineas,\"\r\nsighed Lady Lucy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but so old-fashioned--I do believe I not see my money for it.\r\nVoyez-vous, de Lady Lucy is one petite lady--si jolie mais très petite.\r\nIf she were de tall grand lady, you see de great dresses could fit small\r\nlady, but de leetle dresses fit but ver few.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I sell the green velvet I must have another next winter,\" murmured\r\nLady Lucy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! vous avez raison--when de season nouveautés come in. I tell you\r\nwhat--you let me have also de white lace robe you show me once, the same\r\ntime I bought from you one little old pearl brooch.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wedding-dress? Oh no, I cannot sell my wedding-dress!\" exclaimed poor\r\nLady Lucy, pressing her hands convulsively together.\r\n\r\n\"What for not?--you not want to marry over again--I give you twenty-two\r\npounds for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-two pounds!--why it is Brussels point, and cost a hundred and\r\ntwenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I know--but you forget I perhaps keep it ten years and not sell--and\r\nbesides you buy dear; great lady often buy ver dear!\" and Madame Dalmas\r\nshook her head with the solemnity of a sage.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I cannot sell my wedding-dress,\" again murmured the wife. And be\r\nit recorded, the temptress, for once, was baffled; but at the expiration\r\nof an hour, Madame Dalmas left the house, with a huge bundle under her\r\narm, and a quiet satisfaction revealed in her countenance, had any one\r\nthought it worth while to study the expression of her disagreeable face.\r\n\r\nAgain Lady Lucy locked her door; and placing a bank-note and some\r\nsovereigns on the table, she sank into a low chair, and while a few large\r\nsilent tears flowed down her cheeks, she at last found courage to open\r\nthe three letters which had hitherto remained unread in her apron pocket.\r\nThe first--the second, seemed to contain nothing to surprise her, however\r\nmuch there might be to annoy--but it was different with that last: here\r\nwas a gross overcharge, and perhaps it was not with quite a disagreeable\r\nfeeling that Lady Lucy found something of which she could justly\r\ncomplain. She rose hurriedly and unlocked a small writing-desk, which had\r\nlong been used as a receptacle for old letters and accounts.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the interior of the desk did not present a very\r\norderly arrangement. Cards of address, bills paid and unpaid, copies of\r\nverses, and papers of many descriptions, were huddled together, and it\r\nwas not by any means surprising that Lady Lucy failed in her search for\r\nthe original account, by which to rectify the error in her shoemaker's\r\nbill. In the hurry and nervous trepidation which had latterly become\r\nalmost a constitutional ailment with her, she turned out the contents of\r\nthe writing-desk into an easy chair, and then kneeling before it, she set\r\nherself to the task of carefully examining the papers. Soon she came to\r\none letter which had been little expected in that place, and which still\r\nbore the marks of a rose, whose withered leaves also remained, that had\r\nbeen put away in its folds. The rose Walter Ferrars had given her on the\r\neve of their marriage, and the letter was in his handwriting, and bore\r\nbut a few days earlier date. With quickened pulses she opened the\r\nenvelope; and though a mist rose before her eyes, it seemed to form into\r\na mirror in which she saw the by-gone hours. And so she read--and read.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to laugh at love-letters, perhaps because only the\r\nsilly ones come to light. With the noblest of both sexes such effusions\r\nare sacred, and would be profaned by the perusal of a third person: but\r\nwhen a warm and true heart is joined to a manly intellect; when reason\r\nsanctions and constancy maintains the choice which has been made, there\r\nis little doubt but much of simple, truthful, touching eloquence is often\r\nto be found in a \"lover's\" letter. That which the wife now perused with\r\nstrange and mingled feelings was evidently a reply to some girlish\r\ndepreciation of herself, and contained these words:--\r\n\r\n\"You tell me that in the scanty years of your past life, you already look\r\nback on a hundred follies, and that you have unnumbered faults of\r\ncharacter at which I do not even guess. Making some allowance for a\r\nfigurative expression, I will answer 'it may be so.' What then? I have\r\nnever called you an angel, and never desired you to be perfect. The\r\nweaknesses which cling, tendril-like, to a fine nature, not unfrequently\r\nbind us to it by ties we do not seek to sever. I know you for a\r\ntrue-hearted girl, but with the bitter lessons of life still unlearned;\r\nlet it be my part to shield you from their sad knowledge,--yet whatever\r\nsorrow or evil falls upon you, I must or ought to share. Let us have no\r\nsecrets; and while the Truth which gives its purest luster to your eye,\r\nand its richest rose to your cheek, still reigns in your soul, I cannot\r\ndream of a fault grave enough to deserve harsher rebuke than the kiss of\r\nforgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nWhat lines to read at such a moment! No wonder their meaning reached her\r\nmind far differently than it had done when they were first received. Then\r\nshe could have little heeded it; witness how carelessly the letter had\r\nbeen put away--how forgotten had been its contents.\r\n\r\nHer tears had flowed in torrents, but Lucy Ferrars no longer strove to\r\ncheck them. And yet there gleamed through them a brighter smile than had\r\nvisited her countenance for many a month. A resolve approved by all her\r\nbetter nature was growing firm within her heart; and that which an hour\r\nbefore would have seemed too dreadful to contemplate was losing half its\r\nterrors. How often an ascent, which looks in the distance a bare\r\nprecipice, shows us, when we approach its face, the notches by which we\r\nmay climb!--and not a few of the difficulties of life yield to our will\r\nwhen we bravely encounter them.\r\n\r\n\"Why did I fear him so much?\" murmured Lady Lucy to herself. \"I ought not\r\nto have needed such an assurance as this to throw myself at his feet, and\r\nbear even scorn and rebuke, rather than prolong the reign of falsehood\r\nand deceit. Yes--yes,\" and gathering a heap of papers in her hand with\r\nthe \"love-letter\" beneath, she descended the stairs.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that Lady Lucy paused at the library door--no denying\r\nthat her heart beat quickly, and her breath seemed well-nigh spent; but\r\nshe was right to act on the good impulse, and not wait until the new-born\r\ncourage should sink.\r\n\r\nMr. Ferrars had finished the newspaper, and was writing an unimportant\r\nnote; his back was to the door, and hearing the rustle of his wife's\r\ndress, and knowing her step, he did not turn his head sufficiently to\r\nobserve her countenance, but he said, good-humoredly,\r\n\r\n\"At last! What have you been about? I thought we were to go out before\r\nluncheon to look at the bracelet I mentioned to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Walter--no bracelet--you must never give me any jewels again;\" and\r\nas Lady Lucy spoke she leaned against a chair for support. At such words\r\nher husband turned quickly round, started up, and exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Lucy, my love!--in tears--what has happened?\" and, finding that even\r\nwhen he wound his arm around her she was still mute, he continued,\r\n\"Speak--this silence breaks my heart--what have I done to lose your\r\nconfidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not you--I--\" gasped the wife. \"Your words at breakfast--this\r\nletter--have rolled the stone from my heart--I must confess--the\r\ntruth--I am like Mrs. Beaufort--in debt--frightfully in debt.\" And with a\r\ngesture, as if she would crush herself into the earth, she slipped from\r\nhis arms and sank literally on the floor.\r\n\r\nWhatever pang Mr. Ferrars felt at the knowledge of her fault, it seemed\r\nOverpowered by the sense of her present anguish--an anguish that proved\r\nhow bitter had been the expiation; and he lifted his wife to the sofa,\r\nbent over her with fondness, called her by all the dear pet names to\r\nwhich her ear was accustomed, and nearer twenty times than once gave her\r\nthe \"kiss of forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is of you I have been frightened!\" cried Lady Lucy, clinging to\r\nhis hand. \"You who I thought would never make any excuses for faults you\r\nyourself could not have committed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never been tempted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I? I dare not say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me how it all came about,\" said Mr. Farrars, drawing her to him;\r\n\"tell me from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nBut his gentleness unnerved her--she felt choking--loosened the collar of\r\nher dress for breathing space-and gave him the knowledge he asked in\r\nbroken exclamations.\r\n\r\n\"Before I was married--it--began. They persuaded me so many--oh, so\r\nmany--unnecessary things--were--needed. Then they would not send the\r\nbills--and I--for a long time--never knew--what I owed--and then--and\r\nthen--I thought I should have the power--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your allowance was not sufficient?\" asked Mr. Ferrars, pressing her hand\r\nas he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes, yes! most generous, and yet it was always forestalled to\r\npay old bills: and then--and then my wants were so many. I was so weak.\r\nMadame Dalmas has had dresses I could have worn when I had new ones on\r\ncredit instead, and--and Harris has had double wages to compensate for\r\nwhat a lady's maid thinks her perquisites; even articles I might have\r\ngiven to poor gentlewomen I have been mean enough to sell. Oh, Walter! I\r\nhave been very wrong; but I have been miserable for at least three years.\r\nI felt as if an iron cage were rising around me,--from which you only\r\ncould free me--and yet, till to-day, I think I could have died rather\r\nthan confess to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor girl! Why should you have feared me? Have I ever been harsh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!--no--but you are so just--so strict in all these things--\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I am; and yet not the less do I understand how all this has come\r\nabout. Now, Lucy,--now that you have ceased to fear me--tell me the\r\namount.\"\r\n\r\nShe strove to speak, but could not.\r\n\r\n\"Three figures or four? tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid--yes, I am afraid four,\" murmured Lady Lucy, and hiding her\r\nface from his view; \"yes, four figures, and my quarter received last week\r\ngone every penny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucy, every bill shall be paid this day; but you must reward me by being\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Generous! dearest! But, Walter, if you had been a poor man, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Lucy, that would have been a very different and an infinitely sadder\r\nstory. Instead of the relinquishment of some indulgence hardly to be\r\nmissed, there might have been ruin, and poverty, and disgrace. You have\r\none excuse,--at least you knew that I could pay at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but at what a price! The price of your love and confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Lucy--for your confession has been voluntary; and I will not ask\r\nmyself what I should have felt had the knowledge come from another. After\r\nall, you have fallen to a temptation which besets the wives of the rich\r\nfar more than those of poor or struggling gentlemen. Tradespeople are\r\nshrewd enough in one respect--they do not press their commodities and\r\nlong credit in quarters where ultimate payment seems doubtful--though--\"\r\n\r\n\"They care not what domestic misery they create among the rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay: there are faults on both sides, not the least of them being that\r\ngirls in your station are too rarely taught the value of money, or that\r\nintegrity in money matters should be to them a point of honor second only\r\nto one other. Now listen, my darling, before we dismiss this painful\r\nsubject forever. You have the greatest confidence in your maid, and\r\n_entre nous_ she must be a good deal in the secret. We shall bribe her to\r\ndiscretion, however, by dismissing Madame Dalmas at once and forever. As\r\nsoon as you can spare Harris, I will send her to change a check at\r\nCoutts', and then, for expedition and security, she shall take on the\r\nbrougham and make a round to these tradespeople. Meanwhile, I will drive\r\nyou in the phaeton to look at the bracelet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no-no, dear Walter, not the bracelet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes--I say yes. Though not a quarrel, this is a sorrow which has\r\ncome between us, and there must be a peace-offering. Besides I would not\r\nhave you think that you had reached the limits of my will, and of my\r\nmeans to gratify you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To think that I could have doubted--that I could have feared you!\"\r\nsobbed Lady Lucy, as tears of joy coursed down her cheeks. \"But, Walter,\r\nit is not every husband who would have shown such generosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there are few husbands, Lucy, who do not estimate truth and\r\ncandor as among the chief of conjugal virtues:--ah, had you confided in\r\nme when first you felt the bondage of debt, how much anguish would have\r\nbeen spared you!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJONES ON CHANTREY.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Sir Francis Chantrey, R. A.; Recollections of his Life,\r\nPractice and Opinions_. By George Jones, R. A. London, Moxon, 1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe criticisms of Literature in the _London Times_ are as clever in their\r\nway as the other articles of that famous journal. It keeps a critic of\r\nthe Poe school for pretenders, and the following review of a recent life\r\nof Chantrey the sculptor is in his vein. It embodies a just estimate of\r\nthe artist.\r\n\r\nA good life of Chantrey would be a welcome and a serviceable contribution\r\nto the general store. Chantrey was a national sculptor in the sense that\r\nBurns was a national poet. His genius, of the highest order, indicated\r\nthroughout his career the nature of the soil in which it had been\r\ncherished. As man and artist he was essentially British. By his own\r\nunassisted strength he rose from the ranks, and achieved the highest\r\neminence by the simplest and most legitimate means. His triumph is at\r\nonce a proof of his power, and an answer to all who, instead of putting\r\nshoulder to the wheel, console their mediocrity by railing against the\r\ncold exclusiveness of aristocratic institutions.\r\n\r\nChantrey began life in a workshop. A friend, toward the close of the\r\nartist's life, passing through his studio, was struck by a head of\r\nMilton's Satan lying in a corner. \"That head,\" said Chantrey to his\r\nvisitor, \"was the very first thing that I did after I came to London.\r\nI worked at it in a garret, with a paper cap on my head, and, as I could\r\nthen afford only one candle, I stuck that one in my cap that it might\r\nmove along with me, and give me light whichever way I turned.\" A still\r\nseverer school of discipline had, previously to his appearance in the\r\nLondon garret, given his mind the practical turn chiefly characteristic\r\nof his life and works. He was born in 1782, at Norton, in Derbyshire, and\r\nwhen eight years old lost his father. His mother married again, and in\r\n1798 proposed to apprentice him to a solicitor in Sheffield. Whilst\r\nwalking through that town the boy saw some wood carving in a shop window.\r\nHis good angel was with him at the moment, and stood his friend. Chantrey\r\nbegged to be made a carver, and he was accordingly apprenticed to a Mr.\r\nRamsay, a wood carver in Sheffield.\r\n\r\nAt the house of his master the apprentice often met Mr. Raphael Smith,\r\nknown for his admirable crayon drawings. The acquaintance led to a more\r\nrefined appreciation of art, and excited in the youth so strong a desire\r\nto cultivate it in a higher sphere, that at the age of 21 he gave to his\r\nmaster the whole of his wealth, amounting to £50, to cancel his\r\nindentures. Had he waited patiently for six months longer, his liberty\r\nwould have been his own, unbought. Leaving the carver's shop Chantrey\r\nbegan to study in earnest. He painted a few portraits, which brought him\r\nin a little money, and, with a little more borrowed from his friends, he\r\nstarted for London. Here, guided by common sense, he sought employment as\r\nan assistant carver. He might have starved had he started as a\r\nprofessional painter.\r\n\r\nWhilst laboring for subsistence Chantrey still used his brush, and also\r\nlaid the foundation of his coming success by making models in clay of the\r\nhuman figure. He would hang, says his present biographer, pieces of\r\ndrapery on these models, \"that he might get a perfect knowledge of the\r\nway, and the best way, that it should be represented. In this manner he\r\nwas accustomed to work, and when he had completed one figure or mass of\r\ndrapery he pulled it down and began to model another from drapery\r\ndifferently arranged; for at that time he never did anything without\r\nnature or the material being before him.\" In 1808 Chantrey's first\r\nimaginative work was exhibited. We have already mentioned it. It was the\r\nhead of Satan produced in the garret.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, according to Chantrey himself, he did not gain £5 by his\r\nmodeling. A fortunate commission, however--the bust of Horne\r\nTooke--finally obtained for him other commissions, amounting altogether\r\nTo £12,000. In 1811 \"he married his cousin Miss Wale; with this lady he\r\nreceived £10,000; this money enabled him to pay off some debts he had\r\ncontracted, to purchase a house and ground, on which he built two houses,\r\na studio and offices, and also to buy marble to proceed in the career he\r\nhad begun.\" In 1812 he executed for the city of London a statue in marble\r\nof George III., placed in the council-chamber of Guildhall, and in 1817\r\nhe produced the exquisite monument--not to be surpassed for tenderness of\r\nsentiment and poetic beauty--of the two children whose death this piece\r\nof sculpture now commemorates in Lichfield cathedral. With this\r\nachievement the race was won. In 1818 he was elected an associate of the\r\nRoyal Academy, and as soon after as the practice of the Academy admitted\r\nhe was elevated to the rank of Academican.\r\n\r\nFrom this period until his death, in 1841, the career of the sculptor was\r\na series of noble and well rewarded efforts. He amassed a fortune, which\r\nat his death he bequeathed to the Royal Academy for the promotion of\r\nBritish art. He was a favored subject of three successive Sovereigns, and\r\nthe friend and companion of the most illustrious among his\r\ncontemporaries. His death was somewhat singular. For two years he had\r\nbeen in a declining state of health, but his condition had given his\r\nfriends no immediate alarm. On the 22d of November he wrote to Sir\r\nCharles Clarke, from Norwich, expressing his intention to go to town on\r\nthe following day, and announcing an invitation to Audley-end, which he\r\nhad accepted for the 8th of the following month. On Thursday, the 25th of\r\nNovember, a friend called at his house in London, between 5 and 6\r\no'clock, and was pressed to dine. As he could not do so, Chantrey\r\naccompanied his visitor on his way home as far as Buckingham Palace,\r\ncomplaining on the way of a slight pain in the stomach, but at the same\r\ntime receiving his friend's condolences with jokes and laughter. The\r\nclock struck 7 when the friends shook hands and parted. At 9 Chantrey was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nLet us regard Chantrey from what point we may, the features that present\r\nthemselves to the observer bear the same unmistakable stamp. As sculptor\r\nand as man, at home or abroad, in his serious recreations or pleasurable\r\npursuits, in his temper and social bearing, Francis Chantrey was a\r\nthorough Englishman. Heaven endowed him with genius, and his sound sense\r\nenabled him to take the precious gift as a blessing. Sheffield, that\r\nreared him, had no cause to be uneasy on his account; the prudence and\r\nshrewdness of the North were admirably mingled with the aesthetic\r\nqualities of the South. In the pocketbook which accompanied the sculptor\r\non his Italian tour, notes were found referring to the objects of art\r\nvisited on the way, and in the same tablet were accurate accounts of\r\nexpenditure and the current prices of marble. Avoiding as much as\r\npossible the treatment of purely poetical subjects, Chantrey by the\r\nforce of simplicity idealized the most ordinary topics. He shrank from\r\nallegory by a natural instinct, yet his plain unadorned forms have the\r\nelevation and charm of a figurative discourse. \"Chantrey,\" says Mr.\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n\"Cast aside every extrinsic recommendation, and depended entirely on form\r\nand effect. He took the greatest care that his shadows should tell boldly\r\nand in masses. He was cautious in introducing them, and always reduced\r\nthem as much as might be compatible with the complete development of the\r\nfigure. He never introduced a fold that could be dispensed with, rarely\r\ndeviated from long lines, and avoided abrupt foldings. His dislike to\r\nornament in sculpture was extreme.\"\r\n\r\nIn architecture he liked it no better. Superfluous embellishment in this\r\nbranch of art he held to be either concealment of inability or a\r\ndevelopment of puerile taste. Fine buildings, he asserted, must still be\r\nfine, if divested of every ornament and left altogether bare. Apparent\r\nartlessness is the consummation of art. The busts of Chantrey bear\r\nimmortal testimony to the fact.\r\n\r\nThe manly and courageous view which Chantrey took of his duties as an\r\nartist sustained  him in every attempt he made to impress that view upon\r\nhis works. He is described as \"shrinking from no difficulty,\" as being\r\n\"deterred by no embarrassment that labor, assiduity, and good sense could\r\nsurmount.\" His independence was as great as his energy, and both smacked\r\nof the Saxon blood in his veins. The manner of the sculptor was rough and\r\nunceremonious, but he exhibited as little coarseness in his demeanor as\r\nin the massive figures of his chisel, which might offend some by their\r\nheaviness, but which gratified all by their undoubted grandeur and\r\ndignity. The quiet yet splendid generosity of Chantrey was equally\r\ncharacteristic of his country. He assisted the needy largely and\r\nunobtrusively. Instances of his bounty are on record which would do honor\r\nto the wealthiest patron of art. How much more luster do they shed upon\r\nthe indefatigable day-laborer? If we follow the sculptor from his studio\r\nto the open fields, he is still national to the backbone. He escapes from\r\nLondon to pass days with his rod at the river side, or to walk with his\r\ngun on his arm \"from 10 o'clock until half-past 4 without feeling the\r\nleast fatigue.\" Yesterday he killed two salmon in the Conway, at\r\nLlanrwst, and to-day he kills \"28 hares, 8 pheasants, 4\r\npartridges--total, 40 head, all from my own gun.\" Visit him at home and\r\ne is the prince of hospitality. His dinners are of the best, and he is\r\nnever happier than when presiding at them. Like an Englishman, he was\r\nproud of the illustrious society his success enabled him to summon around\r\nhim, and, like an Englishman too, he had greater pride still in dwelling\r\nupon the humbleness of his origin, and in recounting the history of his\r\ndifficult journey from struggling obscurity to worldwide renown.\r\n\r\nNow, what we contend for is--without presuming ourselves to attempt\r\nanything like a worthy portraiture of Francis Chantrey--that here,\r\nready-made to the hand of any man competent to the task of illustrating a\r\nlife full of instruction for the rising brotherhood of art, is a subject\r\nwhich it behooved the Royal institution that has so largely profited by\r\nChantrey's liberality and fame, not to neglect, much less throw away. The\r\nbook which we have taken for the foundation of this notice, written by a\r\nRoyal Academician, is a disgrace to the Royal Academy. Is then, we ask,\r\nno single member of that gifted body competent to say a word or two in\r\nplain English for the departed sculptor, that such a melancholy\r\nexhibition of helplessness must needs be sent forth as a tribute from\r\nexcellence to excellence? The life of Chantrey properly written could not\r\nbut prove of the utmost value to Englishmen, and simply because it is the\r\ncareer of a man attaining the highest distinction by means thoroughly\r\nunderstood by his countrymen, and by the exercise of an intellect at all\r\ntimes under the salutary influence of a wholesale national bias. Jones on\r\nChantrey is Jenkins on Milton; the poet of Moses and Son upon the\r\n_Inferno_ of Dante--the ridiculous limping after the sublime.\r\n\r\nThe great aim of Mr. George Jones, R.A., in his present undertaking,\r\nseems to have been to exhibit his own vast erudition and his great\r\ncommand of the hard words of his native tongue. Indeed, he quotes so much\r\nGreek and Latin, and talks so finely, that it is only to be regretted\r\nthat he does not now and then come down from his stilts in order to\r\ngratify himself with a little intelligible English and his readers with\r\nsome homely grammar. It will be our painful duty to submit to the\r\nreader's notice a specimen or two of Mr. Jones' peculiar style, which,\r\ntogether with the profound simplicity of his original remarks, make up as\r\ncurious a production as it has ever fallen to our lot to read and to\r\ncriticise.\r\n\r\nWhen our old friend, M. Soyer, declared his conviction that \"to die is a\r\nreligious duty which every human being owes to his Creator,\" and that\r\nwhen the parents of a family are suddenly cut off, the unfortunate event\r\n\"not only affects the children personally, but their future generations,\r\nby destroying all the social comfort which generally exists in such\r\nfamilies, and probably would cause misery to exist instead of happiness,\"\r\nit occurred to us that sterner truisms in more naked guise it would be\r\ndifficult to produce. We had not then read Jones. _His_ self-evident\r\npropositions are perfectly astounding. Here are a few of them.\r\n\r\n\"Chantrey believed that the mind and morals are improved by the\r\ncontemplation of beautiful objects.\" Who could have supposed it?\r\n\"Chantrey was convinced that variety in building, if under the guidance\r\nof good sense and propriety, tends much to the beauty of a country.\" Is\r\nit possible? \"Chantrey believed that all which has been done may be\r\nexceeded _when genius and ability are equal to the task_, for as Raphael\r\nhas surpassed the lay-figure art of most of his predecessors, so no\r\nreason exists why Raphael should not be surpassed.\" Had he never spoken\r\nagain, this idea would have procured him a niche next to Francis Bacon.\r\nThe sculptor actually believed that even the glories of the past may be\r\noutdone when there are genius and ability enough in the world to surpass\r\nthem! Will Mr. Jones favor us with the day and precise moment at which\r\nthis wonderful conception entered the great sculptor's mind? We should\r\nlike to record it. \"Chantrey felt that the blind adoration of right and\r\nwrong was likely to mislead the public.\" We really think we have heard\r\nthe remark before. \"Chantrey referred every object to the Creator of all,\r\nand admired without limit the works of the Great Artificer, from the\r\nsmallest leaf to the noblest production, and in his mundane calling\r\naimed at an imitation of that excellence of beauty which nature has\r\ndisplayed.\" There is nothing like getting at the idiosyncrasies of the\r\nfamous. Since Chantrey, according to Jones, has set the example of\r\nreferring creation to a creator, and of studying nature when be wished to\r\nimitate her, we can only trust that the practice may henceforward be\r\nuniversally adopted. Chantrey was of opinion--no, we mistake, this is\r\nJones' own--Jones is of opinion that \"although the literary education of\r\nartists ought to be as extensive as possible, yet they may sometimes\r\nrequire the assistance of those whose opportunities and abilities have\r\nenabled them to make a deeper research.\" Finely said. Jones is a case in\r\npoint. We do not know the extent of his literary education, but whatever\r\nit be, the assistance of Lindley Murray would, we are certain, be of\r\ninfinite service to him at this moment.\r\n\r\nWe forget how many thousands of pounds, poor Chantrey left to the Royal\r\nAcademy. Jones never tires of lauding the Academy by referring to the\r\nmunificent bequests; yet this, we repeat, is the return made by that\r\nfavored institution, in the person of one of its chief members, to the no\r\nless distinguished and generous donor. The life of Chantrey would not\r\nhave been difficult in the hands of a moderately informed artist. \"Dear\r\nJones, we wanted a man of taste (d--n taste), we mean judgment,\" and your\r\nprofessed regard for your friend should not have rested content until it\r\nhad found one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\nBY R.

Gathered and observed as well by\r\nthose who went first thither as collected by William Strachey, Gent, the\r\nfirst Secretary of the Colony. Now first edited from the original\r\nManuscript, in the British Museum, by R. H. Major, Esq., of the British\r\nMuseum. Printed for the Hakluyt Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a suggestive book, with its prophetic motto,--its dedication to\r\nLord Bacon, the fit patron of discoverers,--and its curious map,\r\n\"described by Captayn John Smith,\" adorned with ships, and huge whales,\r\nand all the land so closely dotted over with tall trees and\r\nmolehill-sized mountains, and here and there the mark of an Indian\r\nsettlement just visible. Worthy William Strachey, Gent., what would be\r\nhis surprise to look over a map of Virginia Britannia,-that \"ample tract\r\nof land\" with \"sufficient space and ground enough to satisfie the most\r\ncovetous,\"--in the year 1850; and to mark the teeming and busy\r\npopulation, the steamboats that navigate the \"five faire and delightfull\r\nnavigable rivers\" within the Chesapeake Bay, the railroads that intersect\r\nthe whole country and the vast human tide still pouring westward?\r\n\"This shall be written for the generation to come,\" is his motto; and\r\ninteresting it is to the reader to follow him in his narrative of the\r\ntoils and privations of the good company to which he was secretary, and\r\nin his full and minute account of the produce of the country, and its\r\nstrange inhabitants. Who William Strachey was, Mr. Major, notwithstanding\r\nall his diligence, has not been able to ascertain. In his dedication to\r\nLord Bacon, he describes himself as having been \"one of the Graies-Inne\r\nSociete,\" and his narrative affords ample proof of his being a man of\r\nlearning and worth: but of his family, the date of his birth or of his\r\ndeath, we have no record.\r\n\r\nThe earlier attempts to colonize North America were numerous, but all\r\nunfavorable. \"Divers voyages\" were made thither from the year 1578 to the\r\nclose of the reign of Elizabeth, but without success; nor were the first\r\nadventurers in the reign of her successor more fortunate.\r\n\r\n\"At the time of the death of Queen Elizabeth, one hundred and eleven\r\nyears subsequent to the great discovery of the Western World by Columbus,\r\nthe Spaniards, on whose behalf his discovery had been made, were the sole\r\npermanent settlers in this wide and wealthy continent. In 1606, the\r\nFrench began to make settlements in Canada and Acadie, now Nova Scotia,\r\nbut it was not till 1607 that the enterprise, which was finally destined\r\nto lay the foundation of British occupancy of American soil, was\r\nundertaken. Twenty-three years had expired since the patent has been\r\ngranted to Sir Walter Raleigh to discover and take possession, with\r\nlittle less than royal privileges, of remote heathen and barbarous lands,\r\nhitherto not actually possessed by any Christian prince; and yet not an\r\nacre of American soil had hitherto become the property of the\r\nEnglish..... It was shortly after this period, viz., A° 1605-6, that\r\nRichard Hakluyt, the '_presidium et dulce decus_' of our Society, to\r\nwhom, as Robertson justly remarks, 'England is more indebted for its\r\nAmerican possessions than to any man of that age,' used influential\r\narguments with various gentlemen of condition, to induce them to present\r\na petition to King James to grant them patents for the settlement of two\r\nplantations on the coast of North America. This petition issued in the\r\nconcession of a charter, bearing date the 10th of April 1606, by which\r\nthe tract of country lying between the thirty-forth and forty-fifth\r\ndegrees of latitude was to be divided into nearly equal portions, between\r\ntwo companies; that occupying the southern portion to be called the first\r\ncolony (subsequently named the London Company), and that occupying the\r\nnorthern, to be called the second colony (subsequently named the Plymouth\r\nCompany). The patent also vested in each colony a right of property over\r\nfifty miles of the land, extending along the coast each side of the point\r\nof first occupation, and a hundred miles inland. The chief adventurers\r\nin the London or South Virginian Company, with which as the first\r\nsettlement we now have principally to do, were Sir Thomas Gates, Sir\r\nGeorge Somers, Richard Hakluyt, and Edward Maria Wingfield. The command\r\nof the expedition was committed to Captain Newport.\"\r\n\r\n\"By a strange caprice of the king, these instructions were sent carefully\r\nsealed up and inclosed in a box, not to be opened till their arrival in\r\nVirginia.\" Thus, destitute of a leader at the time when they most needed\r\none, they chose the gallant Captain John Smith, so well known from \"the\r\nromantic tale of his own life and Englishmen's lives, for his sake, being\r\nsaved once and again, by the personal devotion of the generous but\r\nill-requited Pocahontas.\" Under him the first permanent settlement of the\r\nEnglish in America was effected, and James Town built. In 1609 the\r\nexpedition under Lord Delaware set out; and \"under his enlightened and\r\nbeneficent auspices the colony soon assumed a wholesome and active\r\nappearance.\" Ill health, however, compelled him within two years to\r\nreturn to England: but Sir Thomas Dale arriving soon after, with a fresh\r\nsupply of emigrants, the colony continued prosperous, its affairs\r\nsubsequently retrograded; and Lord Delawarr again went out in the year\r\n1618,--but unfortunately only to die, near the bay which still bears his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"Finally it was not till 1620, after so many abortive efforts had been\r\nmade both by Government and powerful bodies to form an establishment in\r\nNorth Virginia, that at length it received, under unexpected\r\ncircumstances, an influx of settlers which soon rendered it by far the\r\nmost prosperous of all colonies in North America. This was the emigration\r\nof a large band of Puritans, who suffering under the intolerance of the\r\nEnglish Government, on account of non-conformity, first passed into\r\nHolland, and afterward found an asylum in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Historie\" very properly begins with a description of the land.-the\r\nfruitfulness of which is dwelt on; and a hint is given of the probability\r\nthat even gold may be discovered,--and \"sure it is that some mineralls\r\nhave ben there found.\" \"The temperature of the country\" \"doth well agree\r\nwith the English constitutions;\" and moreover, not only all \"needful\r\nfruits and vegetables which we transport from hence and plant there\r\nthrive and prosper well,\" but vines and tobacco and oranges, and probably\r\nsugar-canes, will grow there,--for the soil is \"aromaticall,\" and\r\nmoreover abounds with medicinal plants and drugs. All this is the\r\nfavorable side of the picture;--but then, \"the savages and men of Ind\"\r\nwhose strange appearance and barbarous usages had excited so much fearful\r\ncuriosity at home!--Why, says Master Strachey. \"let me truly saie, how\r\nthey never killed man of ours, but by our men's owne folly and\r\nindiscretion, suffering themselves to be beguiled and enticed up into\r\ntheir howses without their armes; for fierce and cunning as they are,\r\nstill they stand in great awe of us.\" Among them the Sasquesahanougs\r\n\"came to the discoverers with skynns, bowes, arrowes, and tobacco\r\npipes\"--doubtless the calumet of peace \"for presents.\" But the chief\r\nobject of interest is, \"the great King Powhatan.\"--already well known by\r\nthe name as the father of the interesting Indian girl, Pocahontas; \"the\r\ngreatnes and boundes of whose empire, by reason of his powerfulnes and\r\nambition in his youth, hath larger lymitts than ever had any of his\r\npredicessors.\"\r\n\r\n\"The great King\" was not deficient in that important mark of royalty-and\r\nwhich doubtless corroborated the opinion, then widely prevailing, that\r\nthese Indians were of eastern origin--a goodly number of wives. Indeed,\r\n\"he is supposed to have many more than one hundred, all of which he doth\r\nnot keepe, yet as the Turk, in one seraglia or howse, but hath an\r\nappointed number, which reside still in every their severall places,\r\namongst whome, when he lyeth on his bedd, one sittith at his head and\r\nanother at his feet; but when he sitteth at meat, or in presenting\r\nhimself to any straungers, one sittetn on his right hand, and another on\r\nhis leaft.\" And here we have the picture of the great Powhatan, sitting\r\npipe in hand, \"the very moral,\" feather-head-dress and all, of the\r\nprotecting genius of the tobacconist's shop, with a rather pretty-looking\r\nwife on each side and twenty more, laughingly huddled round a huge fire,\r\nat his feet. His family was rather patriarchal; consisting at this time\r\nof twenty sons and ten daughters, besides \"a young one, a great darling,\"\r\nand Pocahontas, \"now married to a private captain.\" Some of his\r\n\"weroances,\" or under governors, took somewhat of kingly state on them,\r\nand so did their favorite wives. One, a very handsome \"savadge woman,\"\r\ntook on her \"a shewe of greatnes\" in this manner.--\r\n\r\n\"I was once early at her howse (yt being sommer tyme), when she was layed\r\nwithout dores, under the shadowe of a broad-leaved tree, upon a pallet of\r\nosiers, spred over with four or five fyne gray matts, herself covered\r\nwith a fare white drest deare skynne or two; and when she rose, she had a\r\nmayd who fetcht her a frontall of white currall, and pendants of great\r\nbut imperfect couloured and worse drilled pearles, which she put into her\r\neares, and a chayne, with long lyncks of copper, which they call\r\nTapoantaminais, and which came twice or thrice about her neck, and they\r\naccompt a jolly ornament; and sure thus attired, with some variety of\r\nfeathers and flowers stuck in their haires, they seeme as _debonaire_\r\nquaynt, and well pleased as (I wis) a daughter of the howse of Austria\r\nbehune [decked] with all her jewells; likewise her mayd fetcht her a\r\nmantell, which, they call puttawus, which is like a side cloak, made of\r\nblew feathers, so arteficyally and thick sewed togither, that it seemed\r\nlike a deepe purple satten, and is very smooth and sleeke; and after she\r\nbrought her water for her hands, and then a braunch or twoo of fresh\r\ngreene asshen leaves, as for a towell to dry them. I offend in this\r\ndigression the willinger, since these were ceremonyes which I did little\r\nlooke for, carrying so much presentetnent of civility.\"\r\n\r\nThe description of the Indian dress does not differ from the modern\r\naccounts; the style of the \"ear-rings,\" however, seems to have interested\r\nStrachey greatly,--especially the \"wild beast's claws\" stuck in, and,\r\nabove all, \"a small greene and yellow-colored live snake, neere half a\r\nyard in length, crawling and lapping himself about his neck.\" Truly, we\r\ncan scarcely be surprised that the early settlers looked with suspicion\r\non men who wore such unchristian-like ornaments, and that they more than\r\nsuspected them to be in league with \"the old serpent.\" A full description\r\nis given of their modes of hunting and fishing; and also of their\r\namusements,--especially their dances, which resemble those of \"frantique\r\nand disquieted bachanalls.\" The writer was not able to obtain much\r\ninformation as to their religion. From some scattered hints, it seems to\r\nhave resembled the Mexican, both in the human sacrifices and in the\r\nsecrecy attending them. They also used a sort of embalming for their\r\nkings, whose bodies were kept in one of their temples.\r\n\r\nTheir principal temple \"is at Vtamussack, proper to Powhatan, upon the\r\ntop of certaine red sandy hills; and it is accompanied by two others\r\nsixty feet in length, filled with images of their kings and deviles, and\r\ntombes of the predecessors. This place they count so holy as that none\r\nbut the priests and kings dare come therein.\" They are not observed to\r\nkeep any specific days of devotion; but from time to time the whole\r\npopulation assemble \"to make a great fier in the house or fields, and all\r\nto sing and daunce about yt, in a ring like so many fayries, with rattles\r\nand showtes.\" This points to an eastern source: so does the following:\r\n\r\n\"They have also divers conjurations: one they made at what tyme they had\r\ntaken Captain Smyth prisoner, to know, as they reported, if any more of\r\nhis countrymen would arrive there, and what they intended; the manner of\r\nyt Captain Smyth observed to be as followeth: first, soe sone as daie was\r\nshut in, they kindled a faire great fier in a lone howse, about which\r\nassembled seven priests, takinge Captain Smyth by the hand, and\r\nappointing him his seat; about the fier they made a kynd of enchanted\r\ncircle of meale; that done, the chiefest priest, attyred as is expressed,\r\ngravely began to sing and shake his rattle, solemly rownding and marching\r\nabout the fier, the rest followed him silently untill his song was done,\r\nwhich they all shutt up with a groane. At the end of the first song the\r\nchief priest layd downe certaine graines of wheat, and so continuyed\r\nhowling and invoking their okeus to stand firme and powerful to them in\r\ndivers varieties of songs, still counting the songs by their graynes,\r\nuntill they had circled the fier three tymes, then they devided the\r\ngraynes by certaine number with little sticks, all the while muttering\r\nsome ympious thing unto themselves, oftentymes looking upon Captain\r\nSmyth. In this manner they contynued ten or twelve howers without any\r\nother ceremonies or intermission, with such violent stretching of their\r\narmes, and various passions, jestures, and simptoms, as might well seeme\r\nstang to him before whom they so conjured, and who every hower expected\r\nto be the hoast and one of their sacrifice. Not any meat did they eat\r\nuntill yt was very late, and the night far spent. About the rising of the\r\nmorning starr they seemed to have finished their work of darknes, and\r\nthen drew forth such provision as was in the said howse, and feasted\r\nthemselves and him with much mirth.\"\r\n\r\nSome part of this narrative reminds us of the conjurations of the\r\nScandinavian prophetess--before she poured forth \"the Runic rhyme,\" as\r\nrelated by Bartolinus; we wish the writer had mentioned whether they\r\nmoved eastward or westward. The prophetess we have just alluded to,\r\ngrasped her staff carved with Runic characters, all the time, and singing\r\na low monotonous chant, she proceeded, _contrary_ to the course of the\r\nsun, round and round the charmed fire. The coincidence is, however,\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe first book ends with a high eulogy on the capabilities of the\r\ncountry; the probability of its containing great mineral wealth, as well\r\nas the certainty of its yielding abundant produce, \"for yt hath (even\r\nbeside necessary helpes, and commodities for life) apparent proufs of\r\nmany naturall riches.\" The second book gives a very interesting account\r\nof the various attempts to colonize this portion of America, from the\r\ntime of the discovery to the expedition of Lord Delawarr,--of which Mr.\r\nMajor has given an excellent epitome in his introduction.\r\n\r\nLooking at the period when this work was probably written, and especially\r\nat the arguments used by the earnest writer, we cannot but think it\r\nlikely that it may have aided the Pilgrim Fathers in their determination\r\nto seek on the farther shores of the Atlantic that freedom which was\r\ndenied them here. Although in manuscript, it may have been well known;\r\nfor we have several instances of copies being made of works not intended\r\nfor the press. In this instance, two copies are still extant; and the\r\ncircumstance of that in the Ashmolean Collection being dedicated to Sir\r\nAllen Apsley, Lucy Hutchinson's father, affords strong probability that\r\nit would soon become known to the Puritans, since the wife of Sir\r\nAllen,--as we learn from her daughter's delightful memoir,--was a warm\r\nadherent to their cause. The incidental benefits which Strachey\r\nanticipates for the natives by their intercourse with civilized and\r\nChristian people were strongly dwelt on by the exiles at Amsterdam; and\r\nthe very motto on the title-page of the work before us--\"This shall be\r\nwritten for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created\r\nshall praise the Lord\"--was so often used by them, that in the record of\r\ntheir settlement at Plymouth it might almost have been taken for _their_\r\nmotto. If such were the case, if the book before us gave, indeed, the\r\nimpulse to that devoted band of settlers, how mighty was its\r\ninfluence:--for seldom have greater destinies been enshrined in a frail\r\nbark than those that freighted the May-flower!--Mr. Major merits much\r\ncommendation for his careful editorship and his illustrative notes: nor\r\nshould the excellent etchings by his lady be overlooked, inasmuch as they\r\ngive additional interest to a very interesting volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[From the Times.]\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LORD MANSFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Campbell has learned to take a broad and manly view of the\r\nProfession which his own erudition adorns. In his temporary retirement he\r\npaid homage to literature; and literature, as is her wont, rewards her\r\nworshiper by extending his vision and emancipating his mind. A more\r\nintimate acquaintance with the transactions and passions of the past, a\r\ndisinterested and unbiased survey of the lives and triumphs of his\r\nillustrious predecessors, has prepared our present Chief Justice for his\r\neminence by teaching him, above all things, that judicial fame does not\r\narise from a dull though perfect knowledge of the technicalities of law,\r\nand that there is all the difference in the world between a splendid\r\nambition and the groveling prosecution of an ignoble trade.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not extraordinary that the life of the great Earl of\r\nMansfield has been contemplated by his biographer until a sense of\r\nhumility has been engendered, and eloquent admiration for transcendent\r\nintelligence evoked. From among a host this luminary stands forth.\r\nFaultless he was not, as we shall presently see; but his failings,\r\nwhatever they may have been, in no way obscured the luster of a genius\r\nthat gave sublimity to the most prosaic of pursuits, and, in the teeth of\r\nprejudice, vindicated law against the toils of the narrow-minded and the\r\nopprobrium of ages. What Bacon proved to philosophy Mansfield in his day\r\nbecame, in a measure, to his own cherished science; and, as Coke affected\r\ncommiseration for the author of the _Novum Organum_, so the fettered\r\nslaves of forms and rules in later times pitied and reproached Lord\r\nMansfield for his declared unconquerable preference for the spirit of\r\njustice to the unilluminated letter of the law.\r\n\r\nNature and education prepared William Murray for the very highest\r\nforensic distinction, and his career is chiefly remarkable for the\r\ncertain, though gradual steps, by which he reached it. His success was\r\nthe legitimate and logical result of the means sedulously taken to obtain\r\nit. Had William Murray failed to win his race, it would have been because\r\nhe had dropped down dead on the course, or violent hands had forbidden\r\nhis progress. The conditions of victory were secured at starting, in his\r\nown person, let the competitors be whom they might. The spirit of the boy\r\nwas as ambitious of worldly glory as the spirit of the man looked for\r\nundying fame; from first to last, from the beginning of the century until\r\nthe close of it, the same application, the same aptitude, the same\r\nself-devotion, and the same clear, unruffled, penetrating judgment, were\r\nvisible in Mansfield's useful and protracted life.\r\n\r\nThe younger son of a poor Scotch lord, whose family favored the Stuart\r\ncause, William Murray quitted his school at Perth on the 15th of March,\r\n1718, being then thirteen years of age, and started on the back of a pony\r\nfor the city of London. His destination was the house of an apothecary,\r\nwho, emigrating from Perth, had settled in London, and was now\r\ncommissioned to see the son of his former patron safely deposited at\r\nWestminster School, where it was hoped the young student would win, in\r\ndue time, his Oxford scholarship. Upon the 8th of May, just two months\r\nafter the journey was commenced, the pony completed his task, and the\r\nrider resolutely began his own. He soon distinguished himself by his\r\nclassical attainments, and, according to Mr. Welsby, \"his superiority was\r\nmore manifest in the declamations than in any of the other exercises\r\nprescribed by the regulations of the school.\" In May, 1723, after a\r\nsevere examination, William Murray took his place as first on the list\r\nof King's scholars who were to proceed to Christ Church.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford the student determined to go to the bar, and through the\r\ngenerosity of the first Lord Foley, who supplied him with funds, he was\r\nenabled to follow a profession for which, as he himself said, he felt \"a\r\ncalling.\" He had not been at Oxford a year before he became a member of\r\nthe Hon. Society of Lincoln's inn, although he did not begin to keep his\r\nterms there until he had taken his bachelor's degree. At college William\r\nMurray was as diligent as he had been at school, and, intent upon renown,\r\nhe took care to make all study subservient to the one great object of his\r\nlife. He read whatever had been written on the subject of\r\noratory,--translated into English every oration of Cicero, and\r\nretranslated it into Latin, until every thought and expression of the\r\nillustrious example was familiar to his mind. He applied himself\r\nvigorously to original composition, and strengthened his intellect by the\r\nperusal of works which do not ordinarily fall within the college course.\r\nHe was still at Oxford in 1727, the year of George the First's death, and\r\nbecame the successful competitor for a prize when the students of the\r\nUniversity were called upon, in the name of the Muses, to mourn over the\r\nurn of the departed Cæsar,--\"of that Cæsar,\" as Mr. Macaulay has it, \"who\r\ncould not read a line of Pope, and who loved nothing but punch and fat\r\nwomen.\" A rival poet upon this occasion was a lad from Eton.\r\nDisappointment and vexation at defeat, it is said, rankled in this boy's\r\nbosom, and opened a wound which closed only with life. Be this as it may,\r\nthe classic rivalry begun at school between Pitt and Murray became fiery\r\nstrife between Chatham and Mansfield, fit for a civilized world to\r\nwitness and to profit by.\r\n\r\nFrom Christ Church to Lincoln's-inn was a transfer of abode, scarcely a\r\nchange of habits or of life. Murray was four years nearer to his goal,\r\nbut that goal had still to be reached, and could only be won by untiring,\r\npatient, and ceaseless endeavor. At Oxford he had attended lectures on\r\nthe _Pandects of Justinian_, \"which gave him a permanent taste for that\r\nnoble system of jurisprudence.\" In his chambers he made himself\r\nthoroughly acquainted with ancient and modern history, applied himself\r\ndiligently to ethics, to the study of Roman civil law, the foundation of\r\njurisprudence, of international law, and of English municipal law. No\r\ndrudgery was too laborious, no toil too dull. Expecting, from his\r\nnorthern connections, to be employed in appeals from Scotland, he made\r\nhimself master of the law of that country, and when he was not engaged in\r\nthese and similar pursuits, or at the Courts of Westminster listening to\r\njudgments, he would take his chief of all delights in the company of the\r\njuridical writers of France, \"that he might see how the Roman and feudal\r\nlaws had been blended in the different provinces of that kingdom.\" Not a\r\nmoment was lost in making preparations for the victory which it was the\r\npurpose of his life to win.\r\n\r\nTechnical knowledge, however, came to enlighten and inform, not to burden\r\nand oppress. The mind of Murray rejoiced in freedom and exercised itself\r\nin light. Text-books were his handmaidens, he was not their slave. The\r\nexclusive labors of the great masters of his craft occupied his hours,\r\nbut he still found time for other more interesting lore common to\r\nmankind. Craig, Bracton, Littleton, and Coke, all in their turns were\r\ntrusty counselors and dear companions, but as welcome as any to his\r\nstudious hearth was the living presence of Alexander Pope. Murray, while\r\nat Westminster, had been introduced to the great poet, and had been\r\ncharmed by his exquisite powers of conversation. Pope was no less struck\r\nby the accomplished genius of the young Scot, \"the silvery tones of whose\r\nvoice,\" it is said, fell like a charm upon every ear. Pope, anxious for\r\nthe success of the youth, visited him at his chambers, in order to teach\r\nhim elocution. Once, says Lord Campbell, the young lawyer \"was surprised\r\nby a gay Templar in the act of practicing the graces of a speaker at a\r\nglass, whilst Pope sat by in the character of preceptor.\" Teacher and\r\npupil would spend hours together thus occupied. Mr. Pope, writes Bishop\r\nWarburton, \"had all the warmth of affection for the great lawyer, and\r\nindeed no man ever more deserved to have a poet for his friend.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Murray paid a short visit to the continent, and on the 23d of\r\nNovember in that year he was called to the bar in Lincoln's-inn hall.\r\nNever was lawyer better armed for the battle of life. How he had\r\nqualified himself for the practice of his profession we have attempted in\r\nour narrow space to show. With a rooted attachment to that profession,\r\nwith a lofty ambition and noble desire to serve his country, and a\r\nconsciousness of strength equal to the bravest undertaking; with a mind\r\nthoroughly imbued with the literature of Greece and Rome, as well as of\r\nhis own country; with a perfect understanding of the codes of every\r\ncivilized nation, ancient and modern; with an intimate knowledge and an\r\naccurate appreciation of the peculiarities of our mixed constitution;\r\nwith a natural dignity of manner that commanded instant respect; with a\r\nclear persuasive power of oratory that never failed to win the sympathy\r\nof all to whom it was addressed; with a voice that in earlier days had\r\nbeen compared to the note of the nightingale; with almost every\r\nintellectual and physical gift which nature could confer, and with every\r\ngift gratefully received and assiduously improved, William Murray stood\r\nat the threshold of his career and waited calmly for his opportunity. It\r\nis sufficient to say that the opportunity came. Twelve years after Murray\r\nwas called to the bar, he was appointed Solicitor-General by the\r\nGovernment which had risen upon the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole, and\r\nwhich knew how to estimate the value of so rare an acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe success of Murray in the House of Commons justified the reputation\r\nwhich the new Solicitor-General had already attained at the bar. His\r\nfirst speech, as member for Boroughbridge, fixed his position. He\r\nmaintained it for fourteen years, when he quitted the lower house upon\r\nhis elevation to the bench. When Murray accepted office under the\r\nPelhams, another much more ardent and unscrupulous politician already in\r\nthe House of Commons was writhing under the vexation of neglect. The\r\nSolicitor-General had met the ambitious youth before, and the\r\nrecollection of their last parting was hardly likely to insure a cordial\r\nor a friendly recognition. Murray's first task in Parliament was to\r\ndefend the employment of Hanoverian troops, 16,000 of whom had recently\r\nbeen taken into British pay. Pitt, at the head of the \"Boys,\" as Walpole\r\ncalled the burning patriots whose services he had himself respectfully\r\ndeclined, and hounded on by the Jacobites and Tories, denounced the steps\r\nas \"illegal, unconstitutional, a sacrifice of British to electoral\r\ninterests, and a prelude to the introduction of despotism into this\r\ncountry.\" Pitt was created to denounce, Murray to defend. Overwhelming\r\nas the torrent of declamation and invective might be which Pitt knew so\r\nwell how and when to pour forth, the barrier set up against it by the\r\ncalm dignity, the perfect reasoning, the marvelous self-government, the\r\nexquisite tones, and conciliatory manner of Murray, was more than\r\nsufficient to protect him against submersion. A division taking place\r\nupon the Hanoverian question, Government found themselves in a large\r\nmajority. Murray was pronounced to be a match for his rival, and George\r\nII. became suddenly as attached to the one as he had long hated and\r\nfeared the other.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March, 1754, Mr. Pelham, the Prime Minister, died, and, had\r\nMurray's ambition soared in that direction, he might at once have stepped\r\ninto the vacant office. He had long been the prop of the Ministry in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and was by far the most sagacious member of the\r\nGovernment. Throughout his Parliamentary career, what has happily been\r\ncalled his \"clear, placid, mellow splendor\" had suffered no tarnish, and\r\nhad not been obscured by a single cloud. Always ready, well informed,\r\nlucid in argument, and convincing in manner, he had virtually assumed the\r\nleadership in the House of Commons, and his elevation would in no way\r\nhave altered the aspect or proceedings of that assembly. The nation\r\nrespected him, and the monarch regarded him with more than common favor.\r\nMurray, however, coveted not the prize. Mr. Macaulay, referring to this\r\nperiod in one of his masterly essays, attributes the conduct of the\r\nSolicitor-General to moral infirmity. \"The object of Murray's wishes,\" he\r\nsays, \"was the judicial bench. The situation of Chief Justice might not\r\nbe so splendid as that of First Lord of the Treasury, but it was\r\ndignified, it was quiet, it was secure; and therefore it was the favorite\r\nsituation of Murray.\" Lord Campbell states the case more creditably, and,\r\nas we think, more fairly to Lord Mansfield. \"From a high feeling,\" says\r\nthe biographer, \"that his destiny called him to reform the jurisprudence\r\nof his country, he sincerely and ardently desired to be placed on the\r\nbench, and the especial object of his ambition was to be Chief Justice of\r\nEngland.\" We remember that, whilst a lad, and destined by his parents for\r\nthe church. Murray, of his own motion, dedicated himself to the study of\r\nthe law, feeling a \"calling\" for that profession. Why Lord Mansfield had\r\nresisted every temptation in order to secure the eminence for which, it\r\nis not too much to say, he was in all respects better fitted than any who\r\nhave won it, became evident enough within a year of his appointment to\r\nthe bench. Moral courage he lacked; something nobler than its want led\r\nhim to renounce the Premiership.\r\n\r\nWhat Murray rejected the less capable and not over nice Duke of Newcastle\r\nGreedily seized. The Attorney-General, Sir Dudley Ryder, was elevated to\r\nthe bench, and Murray, gaining a step in professional rank, was by so\r\nmuch nearer to the consummation of his hopes. Never was Ministry so\r\nthoroughly weak and so wretchedly unfortunate. The whole burden of\r\ndefending it rested in the House of Commons upon the shoulders of the\r\nAttorney-General, and the feebleness of the Government was all the more\r\npainful from the manifest strength of the great master of sarcasm and\r\ninvective, their unflinching opponent, growing in favor throughout the\r\ncountry, merciless in his attack at all times, but terrific in his\r\nonslaughts upon a foe worthy of his hatred, and capable of defense.\r\nImagination cannot linger upon a finer picture than is presented in the\r\npersons of these mighty combatants; nor is the effect diminished by the\r\nfact that of their great achievements little remains beyond the bare\r\ntradition. We know that by a word, a gesture, a glance of his eagle eye,\r\nPitt awed the House of Commons, and chilled it into death-like silence.\r\nWe have heard how like a torrent his unpremeditated and impassioned\r\noratory rushed into the hearts of men, expelling rooted convictions, and\r\nwhatever else possessed them at the moment; how readily he spoke on all\r\nemergencies, how daring were his strange digressions, how apposite his\r\nillustrations, how magnificent and chivalric the form and structure of\r\nhis thoughts--how madly spirit-stirring his high and stern appeals. We\r\nhave read of the proud bearing of the austere yet gentle commoner, to\r\nwhom it was a matter of sublime indifference whether in a debate he rose\r\nlate or early, first or last, and who ever contented himself with simply\r\nfollowing the current, and obeying the fine instinct of his own rapt\r\nmind, regardless of the speakers who had gone before, or were about to\r\nfollow him. We have pictured to ourselves the commanding countenance, the\r\ncharacteristic action, the patrician manner that belonged to William Pitt\r\nas exclusively as his own wild and wayward genius; but records are\r\nwanting to establish all that we feel and know. Fragments of Pitt's\r\noratory only have reached us, and of these but few can be pronounced\r\nwholly authentic. What that oratory must have been we learn from its\r\neffects. More is not vouchsafed us. What remains to us of Murray's\r\nspeeches in Parliament is equally meager and unsatisfactory, but we may\r\njudge of his power by reflecting upon the character of the assailant with\r\nwhom he successfully wrestled. There must surely have been wonderful\r\ncapability of argument, vast knowledge, a faculty of persuasion\r\nirresistible in its winning grace, all combined in the man able, by the\r\nmere force of quiet intellectual skill, to bear the brunt of an assault\r\nwhich threatened demolition in its furious advance, and to turn aside\r\nblows intended for annihilation. Lord Chesterfield addressing his son,\r\npoints to Pitt and Murray as to two great models for imitation.\r\nContemporary history assigns to them the highest place among their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 Sir Dudley Ryder died, and Murray immediately claimed the vacant\r\nChief Justiceship. The Duke of Newcastle was panic-stricken by the\r\nannouncement. It has it said that from the beginning the Attorney-General\r\nhad been the mainstay of the Government; but at this particular crisis\r\nhis adherence was essential to its life. The nation was discontented and\r\nsullen, as well it might be. War, carried on in almost every part of the\r\nworld, had resulted in lasting disgrace to England. Minorca had been lost\r\nto her through the folly or cowardice of an English admiral, and\r\nelsewhere ignominious defeat had attended her arms. Addresses from the\r\nThrone poured in, intimations of stopping the supplies were thrown out,\r\nand unmistakable references made to the conduct of the chiefs of the\r\nGovernment. Fox, the only capable Minister, resigned his office in fear\r\nand disgust, and, at the very moment when Newcastle turned to Murray as\r\nto his last hope and refuge in the coming storm, that cautious and\r\nresolute official respectfully demanded the promotion to which he had a\r\nright. Alarmed for his place and his head, the Duke promised the\r\nAttorney-General enough to make the fortunes of six if he would but\r\nforego his purpose. He should have the Duchy of Lancaster for life,\r\ntellerships and reversions without end for himself and his nephew, Lord\r\nStormont; if he would only stay in the House of Commons until the address\r\nwas carried he should have a pension of 6,000l. a-year; offers rose as\r\nMurray showed himself more firm. Temptation came in vain. Murray averred\r\nthat he \"would on no terms agree to remain in the House of Commons for\r\none session longer, or one month, or one day, even to support the\r\naddress;\" he \"never again would enter that assembly.\" If he could not be\r\nChief Justice he would not be Attorney-General. That peremptory avowal\r\nwas enough. To keep Murray from opposition, Newcastle conferred upon the\r\ncountry the only great boon he ever bestowed upon it, and made the\r\nAttorney-General Chief Justice of the King's Bench. The poor Duke gained\r\nlittle by the move. Forced in his naked helplessness to resign, he was\r\nsucceeded by the Duke of Devonshire, who took care to appoint Pitt\r\nSecretary of State, and to give him the lead in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nUpon the 8th day of November, 1756, Murray was sworn in before Lord\r\nChancellor Hardwicke, and created a peer by the title of Baron Mansfield,\r\nof Mansfield, in the county of Nottingham, and three days afterward he\r\nsat for the first time in the Court of King's Bench. \"Over that great\r\ncourt,\" says Lord Brougham, \"he presided for thirty years, and his\r\nadministration of its functions during that long period shed a luster\r\nalike upon the tribunal and the judge.\" During that period, too, but two\r\ncases occurred in which his opinion was not unanimously adopted by his\r\nbrethren; and of the many thousand judgments which he pronounced but two\r\nwere reversed. In all his time no bill of exceptions was ever tendered to\r\nhis direction, and \"all suitors sanguine in their belief of being\r\nentitled to succeed\" were eager to bring their causes to be tried before\r\nhim. There were drawbacks to Murray's complete success in the House of\r\nCommons; there were qualities which he lacked whilst practicing at the\r\nbar. Mansfield wanted nothing to make up the perfect portrait of a\r\nBritish judge. In the Legislature he was helpless in attack; and both in\r\nthe House of Commons and in the House of Lords he exhibited on more than\r\none occasion a want of moral courage as humiliating to his friends as it\r\nproved profitable to his foes; at the bar, learned and able though he\r\nalways was, yet wary circumspection even there cramped his powers and\r\ndeprived him of the transcendent reputation which other advocates have\r\nearned. On the bench there was neither fear nor hesitation, neither undue\r\ncaution nor lack of energy, to impede his great intelligence. There he\r\nsat, as above the common passions of humanity, surveying its doings with\r\na mind unobscured by prejudice, as wide in its grasp as it was masculine\r\nit capability. His clearness of apprehension, his perspicuity of\r\nstatement, his perfect self-command, his vast knowledge of every kind,\r\nwere amongst the least of his qualifications for his high station. More\r\npreeminently than all was his heroic and almost chivalric devotion to the\r\njudicial office; his stern and unflinching love of justice, as\r\ndistinguished from \"the puny technicalities of an obscure walk;\" his\r\nsuperiority to the favors of the great or to the clamors of the many, and\r\nhis unquestioned spotless integrity. During a portion of his lengthened\r\njudicial career Lord Mansfield held a seat in the Cabinet, but nobody\r\nthought of questioning the purity of his judgments on that account.\r\nToward the close of his judicial life Lord George Gordon was tried for\r\nInciting the rioters who set fire to Lord Mansfield's house and destroyed\r\nhis property. Lord Mansfield was the presiding judge on that memorable\r\noccasion, and it was upon his exposition of the law of high treason to\r\nthe jury, and after his summing up, that Lord George Gordon was\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\n\"The benefits conferred by this accomplished judge upon the Court and\r\nupon its suitors,\" says one of his biographers,--\r\n\r\n\"Were manifold and substantial. He began by at once so regulating the\r\ndistribution of the business, as to remove all uncertainty of the matters\r\nwhich should be taken up each day, and to diminish both the expense, and\r\nthe delay, and the confusion of former times. He restored to the whole\r\nbar the privilege of moving in turn, instead of confining this to the\r\nlast day of the term. He almost abolished the tedious and costly practice\r\nof having the same case argued several times over, restricting such\r\nrehearings to questions of real difficulty and adequate importance.\" The\r\nbenefits conferred upon the country were far greater. Burke, once quoting\r\nan argument of Solicitor-General, Murray, said that \"the ideas of Murray\r\ngo to the growing melioration of the law by making its liberality keep\r\npace with the demands of justice and the actual concerns of the\r\nworld--not restricting the infinitely diversified occasions of men and\r\nthe rules of natural justice within artificial circumscriptions, but\r\nconforming our jurisprudence to the growth of our commerce and our\r\nempire.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement is just, and a finer panegyric it were impossible to write.\r\nOur limits, unfortunately, enable us only to indicate the achievements of\r\nChief Justice Mansfield; but such indications must be given, however\r\nbriefly. He found the common law of England a reproach, and, according to\r\nProfessor Story, \"he put England, America, and the whole civilized world\r\nunder the deepest obligations\" by the permanent improvement which he\r\neffected in the system. During the reign of George II. England had become\r\nthe greatest manufacturing and commercial country in the world, but her\r\njurisprudence had, in the meanwhile, made no provision whatever for the\r\nregulation of commercial dealings. When questions arose affecting\r\npurchases and sales, the affreightment of ships, marine insurances, bills\r\nof exchange, and promissory notes, it was impossible to decide them;\r\nthere were no cases to refer to, no treatises to consult. Lord Mansfield\r\ngrappled with the difficulty and overcame it. His judicial decisions\r\nsupplied the deficiencies of law and became themselves law. His mode\r\nof procedure was as philosophical as it was bold. From every case that\r\ncame before him he extracted a general principle of universal\r\napplication, and availed himself of it not only to rule the particular\r\ncase under consideration, but to serve as a guide in all similar cases\r\nhereafter; and he would enlarge upon the principle thus brought out\r\nuntil, as his contemporaries declare, all listeners were lost in\r\nadmiration at the strength and stretch of his understanding. Lord\r\nCampbell tells us that the common law of England which Lord Mansfield had\r\nto administer upon his elevation to the bench, \"was a system admirably\r\nadapted to the condition of England in the Norman and early Plantagenet\r\nreigns, whence it sprang up.\" As high an authority in America declares\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\"Wherever commerce shall extend its social influences, wherever justice\r\nshall be administered by enlightened and liberal rules, wherever\r\ncontracts shall be expounded upon the eternal principles of right and\r\nwrong, wherever moral delicacy and judicial refinement shall be infused\r\ninto the municipal code, at once to persuade men to be honest and to keep\r\nthem so; wherever the intercourse of mankind shall aim at something more\r\nelevating than that groveling spirit of barter in which meanness, and\r\navarice, and fraud strive for the mastery over ignorance, credulity, and\r\nfolly, the name of Lord Mansfield will be reverenced, not only for\r\nadapting the inefficient system which he found to the exigencies of his\r\nown age in his own country, but for furnishing forever the great laws\r\nfounded upon everlasting truth and justice to the whole family of man.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1760 George III. ascended the throne, and Mansfield became a member of\r\nthe Cabinet, of which Bute was at the head. Ten years afterward the Chief\r\nJustice prudently withdrew from the intimate connection with the\r\nGovernment, into which he ought never to have entered, and seven years\r\nBefore his retirement the brief, though magnificent authority of Bute,\r\nhad been shattered to pieces, and the Minister himself disgraced. But,\r\nalthough Cabinet Councils were henceforward held without the Chief\r\nJustice, Lord Mansfield in his place in Parliament stood by the\r\nGovernment, and vigorously defended them against a virulent Opposition.\r\nPitt, \"blasting his character,\" according to Horace Walpole, \"for the\r\nsake of a paltry annuity and a long-necked peeress,\" had followed his\r\nancient rival into the House of Lords, and by this suicidal act given\r\nMansfield an immense advantage. Chatham, eager enough to tie his victim\r\nto the stake, was doomed to bitter disappointment in an arena utterly\r\nunfitted for the exercise of his peculiar powers. The atmosphere of the\r\nHouse of Peers, admirably suited to the calm dignity and sublime\r\nmoderation of Mansfield, proved too often nipping frost to the burning\r\ndeclamation of the man whose very look could rouse a more popular\r\nassembly, and whose words oftener than once had inspired it with the\r\nnoblest sentiments. It was not in the House of Lords that at this period\r\nof his history Lord Mansfield found his most dangerous opponent. A secret\r\nenemy had arisen in the outside world amongst the people, one even more\r\nunscrupulous than Chatham in his animosity: one who reveled in his\r\nquestionable privilege of striking in the dark, and who justified abuse\r\nthat knew no mercy, and acknowledged no law, by reiterated and fervid\r\nappeals to God and his country. The moral courage of Murray had once\r\ngiven way in the House of Commons, when Pitt, speaking daggers to him,\r\nand suddenly exclaiming, \"Judge Festus trembles, he shall hear me another\r\nday,\" quietly sat down. But his sufferings were nothing compared with the\r\ntorture his weakness underwent beneath the repeated inflictions of the\r\nunsparing Junius.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year 1769 Junius sent forth his celebrated letter\r\nto the King, for the publication of which criminal informations were laid\r\nagainst Woodfall, as well as against Almon and Miller, who immediately\r\nreprinted the libel. \"Rex v. Almon\" was the first case brought to trial,\r\nand the jury found a general verdict of guilty. The defense set up in the\r\ntrial against Woodfall was, that the letter was not libellous. The part\r\nwhich Lord Mansfield took is well known. He contended that\r\n\r\n\"All the jury had to consider was, whether the defendant had published\r\nthe letter set out in the information, and whether the inuendos, imputing\r\na particular meaning to particular words, as that 'the K----' meant His\r\nMajesty King George III., but that they were not to consider whether the\r\npublication was 'false and malicious,' these being mere formal words, and\r\nthat whether the letter was libellous or innocent was a pure question of\r\nlaw, upon which the opinion of the court might be taken by a demurrer, or\r\na motion in arrest of judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury retired, and after some hours deliberation returned a verdict of\r\n\"Guilty of the printing and publishing only.\" The attempt of Lord\r\nMansfield to withdraw the cognizance of the question of libel from the\r\njury to vest it in the court, contrary, as it unquestionably was, both to\r\nliberty and law, had high authorities for its justification, and was\r\nsupported by the unanimous opinion of the judges who sat at his side.\r\nPosterity will acquit the otherwise upright judge of the moral obliquity\r\nof which his living enemies, with regard to this proceeding, pronounced\r\nhim guilty, and for which Junius would have crushed the Chief Justice,\r\nhad his ability been equal to his will.\r\n\r\nIt behooves the present generation to approach the lucubrations of the\r\nredoubted Junius in a spirit of enlightened discrimination. We must bear\r\nin mind that the poisoned arrows of the unseen combatant were discharged\r\nat a period peculiarly favorable for the exercise of his destructive\r\nskill; when startling invective was in fashion; when the mercenary acts\r\nof the foremost public man excused, if they did not justify, wholesale\r\nand unreflecting chastisement; when the public press was in its earliest\r\ninfancy, and public writers had not yet educated the audience whose good\r\nsense now holds the libertinism of even the public censor in check, and\r\nprovides its own best remedy against the crimes or follies of the pen.\r\nJunius but imitated the example of his betters when he fastened upon a\r\nfoe, guilty or innocent, and heaped upon his head every opprobrious term\r\na heated imagination could supply. A statesman's policy had but to be\r\ninconvenient to his adversary in order to prove the Minister \"hateful,\"\r\n\"execrable,\" \"abominable,\" \"wicked,\" a traitor to his country, and a\r\nconspirator against the liberties of the people. Pitt honored Walpole\r\nwith such vituperation, and when Walpole went out, and Carteret came in\r\nwithout Pitt, the same expressive language was transferred by the\r\nillustrious commoner from Minister to Minister, as though no virtue\r\ncould possibly be found in any Government without his presence. When\r\nJunius affected to regard Lord Mansfield as the incarnation of all that\r\nis odious in humanity, his praise of Lord Chatham knew no bounds; yet it\r\nis well known that under another disguise Junius dealt far severer blows\r\nagainst the patriot than he ever inflicted upon a man born, as he says,\r\nto abet despotism in its hateful attempts to trample upon the people's\r\nrights. Nothing can be more inconsistent than the accusations brought by\r\nJunius against Lord Mansfield. In one and the same breath he charges him\r\nwith assuming an arbitrary power of doing right; so that if he does wrong\r\nit lies only between him and his conscience; and with condescending to\r\nevasive, indirect courses, in the temper of a quibbler. Now the Chief\r\nJustice is something more than a lawyer, now considerably less. At one\r\nmoment he is setting common law at defiance, at another he is twisting\r\nthe law to the purposes of corruption, and taking refuge behind the forms\r\nwhich he is expressly charged with heroically setting at defiance. Had\r\nLord Mansfield been less timorous, Junius might have been less daring. At\r\nthe close of one of his letters the reckless assailant writes \"Beware how\r\nyou indulge the first emotions of your resentment. This paper is\r\ndelivered to the world, and cannot be recalled. The prosecution of an\r\ninnocent printer cannot alter facts nor refute arguments. Do not furnish\r\nme with further materials against yourself.\" Another venomous diatribe\r\nends with a similar threat. Dare \"to represent this charge as a contempt\r\nof the authority of the House of Peers, and move their Lordships to\r\ncensure the publisher of this paper, and I affirm that you support\r\ninjustice by violence; that you are guilty of a heinous aggravation, of\r\nyour offense; and that you contribute your utmost influence to promote,\r\non the part of the highest court of judicature, a positive denial of\r\njustice to the nation!\" Junius traded up on the invincible infirmity of a\r\njudge, who might have been destroyed by his weakness had he not been\r\nupheld by his unsullied purity and fame.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of Junius were not without effect on Parliament. A motion was\r\nmade in the House of Commons for \"a committee to inquire into the\r\nproceedings of the judges in Westminster Hall, particularly in cases\r\nrelating to the liberty of the press.\" In the House of Lords Lord Chatham\r\nand Lord Camden re-echoed the charges of the House of Commons, and while\r\nthe latter warned noble lords how they received the opinions in that\r\nHouse of the \"most experienced lawyers\" upon questions of law, the\r\nformer, in his accustomed style, threatened to ring again and again \"the\r\nalarm-bell of liberty,\" until he \"could rouse the people to a proper\r\nsense of their injuries.\" Stung by persecution Lord Mansfield suffered\r\nhimself to be betrayed into unaccountable error. Intimating one day that\r\nhe had something of importance to bring to the notice of the House, he\r\nmoved that their Lordships should be summoned to receive the\r\ncommunication. The appointed day arrived, and the attendance of peers was\r\nunusually large. Lord Mansfield rose amidst profound and anxious silence.\r\nLord Chatham and Lord Camden had calumniated the judges, and they were\r\nnow no doubt to be the objects of a vote of censure. Nothing of the kind.\r\nLord Mansfield simply informed the House that he had left a paper with\r\nthe clerk assistant containing the judgment of the Court of King's Bench\r\nin the case of \"the King against Woodfall,\" and then, to the astonishment\r\nof every one, resumed his seat. Lord Camden rose and inquired whether the\r\nnoble lord intended hereafter to found any motion on his paper? Lord\r\nMansfield answered \"No,\" and the House proceeded to other business. The\r\nvery next day Lord Camden resumed the subject. He regarded the conduct of\r\nthe Chief Justice as a challenge against himself, and he at once accepted\r\nit. In direct contradiction to Lord Mansfield he maintained that his\r\ndoctrine was not the law of England. He had considered the noble lord's\r\n\"paper,\" and had not found it very intelligible. He begged to propose\r\nfour questions to the noble and learned lord, to which he required\r\ncategorical answers, that their lordships might know precisely the points\r\nthey had to discuss. The questions were submitted, and Lord Mansfield,\r\ninstead of meeting them, \"with most abject soothings,\" as Horace Walpole\r\ngleefully says, \"paid the highest compliments to Lord Camden.\" He had the\r\nhighest esteem for the noble and learned lord who thus attacked him, and\r\nhad ever courted his esteem in return. He had not expected this treatment\r\nfrom his candor. It was unfair; he would not answer interrogatories. The\r\nreply was a signal for relentless torment. Not a peer interposed on his\r\nbehalf. Distressed by his misery, Lord Mansfield sat down, remained\r\nstill, and in sheer pity for their prey the dogs were called off.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Lord Chatham died, and from the departure of the great commoner\r\nuntil his own decease Lord Mansfield occupied a more conspicuous place as\r\na judge than as a politician in the public eye. He continued to display\r\nupon the bench, as heretofore, the keenest perception, a resolute\r\nobedience to the dictates of justice, high incorruptibility, great\r\nlearning, and thorough self-devotion to his beloved and chosen\r\noccupation. He has been largely accused of favoring, in his early\r\nmanhood, the designs of the Pretender, yet, from the beginning to the\r\nclose of his public life, his fidelity to the reigning family could not\r\nbe called in question. He has been charged with gratifying prerogative at\r\nthe expense of law, yet the liberty of the law was never more perfect,\r\nthe rights of the subject  were never more secure, than during his long\r\ntenure of the judicial office. He has been stigmatized by Junius as an\r\noppressor of men's consciences, yet no man of his time regulated his\r\nconduct with a stricter regard to the humanizing principle of religious\r\ntoleration. Had Lord Mansfield been faithless to the people his death\r\nwould never have been regarded as an irreparable loss by the whole\r\ncountry; had he been a bigot, the world would never have lost the\r\ntreasures which it is said were consumed in the house burnt to the ground\r\nby zealous Protestants eager to take the life as well as to destroy the\r\ngoods of Lord Mansfield, for no other reason than that he chose to hold\r\nthe scales of justice fairly and steadily between Protestant and\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\nIn his 82d year, having been absent scarcely a day from court, Lord\r\nMansfield retired to Tunbridge Wells for the benefit of his health. The\r\nyear following he resigned his office. For six years longer he lived in\r\ndignified retirement, occupying himself in his garden, or refreshing his\r\nmind with the works that had charmed and instructed his youth. To the\r\nlast he retained his memory, and, dying without a pain at the close of\r\nthe century, the man who had spent his happiest evenings with Pope was\r\ndestined to listen to all the horrors of the French Revolution, in common\r\nwith thousands living at the present hour. Lord Mansfield's death was\r\nmourned as a national calamity; his remains were deposited in Westminster\r\nAbbey, and they lie close to those of the Earl of Chatham. After the\r\nstormy conflict of a glorious life, the two schoolboy rivals lie side by\r\nside in silent and everlasting repose.\r\n\r\nWe have freely stated the one great deformity of Lord Mansfield's\r\ncharacter; his quailing before Lord Camden is but a solitary instance of\r\nthe fault that tarnished his otherwise brilliant career. When we have\r\nsaid that the Chief Justice acted unconstitutionally in continuing in the\r\nCabinet whilst he held the Judicial office, and that, admitted to the\r\nfriendship and confidence of his sovereign, he did not scruple to\r\nexercise power without official responsibility, we have confessed to the\r\nmost serious offenses with which he is chargeable. It is not, however, to\r\ndwell upon these blemishes of true greatness, or to indulge in idle\r\npanegyric, that we have occupied so large a portion of valuable space,\r\nand intermixed with the living doings of today one striking record of the\r\nburied past. The life of Lord Mansfield is nothing to us if it yields no\r\nprofitable instruction and contains no element of usefulness for the\r\ngeneration to whom our labors are addressed. Is it wholly unnecessary to\r\nplace at this moment before the bar of England so noble a model for\r\nimitation so sublime an ideal for serious contemplation as that offered\r\nin the person of the Earl of Mansfield? Is it impertinent to warn our\r\nlawyers, that, without confirmed habits of industry, temperance,\r\nself-subjugation, unsullied honor, vast knowledge, enlightened and lofty\r\nviews of their difficult yet fascinating profession, and a love of the\r\neternal principles of truth and justice, incompatible with meanness and\r\ndegrading practice, true eminence is impossible, and imperishable renown\r\nnot to be obtained? Never, at any other period of our history, has it\r\nbeen so necessary to urge upon the students of the law the example of\r\ntheir worthiest predecessors. The tendency of the age is to lower, not to\r\nelevate, the standard set up by our ancestors for the attainment of\r\npreeminence. That our giants may not be stunted in their growth--that the\r\nlegal stock may not hopelessly degenerate--Chief Justice Campbell does\r\nwell to impress upon his brethren the patient and laborious course--the\r\nhigh and admirable qualities--by which Chief Justice Mansfield secured\r\nhis greatness and his fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL;\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK 1.--INITIAL CHAPTER; SHOWING HOW MY NOVEL CAME TO BE WRITTEN.\r\n\r\nSCENE, _The Hall in Uncle Roland's Tower_. TIME,_Night_--SEASON,\r\n_Winter_.\r\n\r\nMr. Caxton is seated before a great geographical globe, which he is\r\nturning round leisurely, and \"for his own recreation,\" as, according to\r\nSir Thomas Browne, a philosopher should turn round the orb, of which that\r\nglobe professes to be the representation and effigies. My mother having\r\njust adorned a very small frock with a very smart braid, is holding it\r\nout at arm's length, the more to admire the effect. Blanche, though\r\nleaning both hands on my mother's shoulder, is not regarding the frock,\r\nbut glances toward _Pisistratus_, who, seated near the fire leaning back\r\nin his chair, and his head bent over his breast, seems in a very bad\r\nhumor. Uncle Roland, who has become a great novel reader, is deep in the\r\nmysteries of some fascinating Third Volume. Mr. Squills has brought _The\r\nTimes_ in his pocket for his own especial profit and delectation, and is\r\nnow bending his brows over \"the state of the money market,\" in great\r\ndoubt whether railway shares can possibly fall lower. For Mr. Squills,\r\nhappy man! has large savings, and does not know what to do with his\r\nmoney; or, to use his own phrase, \"how to buy in at the cheapest, in\r\norder to sell out at the dearest.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, musingly.--\"It must have been a monstrous long journey. It\r\nwould be somewhere hereabouts I take it, that they would split off.\"\r\n\r\n_My Mother_, mechanically, and in order to show Austin that she paid, him\r\nthe compliment of attending to his remarks--\"Who split off, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, Kitty,\" said my father, in great admiration, \"you ask just the\r\nquestion which it is most difficult to answer. An ingenious speculator on\r\nraces contends that the Danes, whose descendants make the chief part of\r\nour northern population, (and indeed if his hypothesis could be correct,\r\nwe must suppose all the ancient worshipers of Odin,) are of the same\r\norigin as the Etrurians. And why, Kitty, I just ask you, why?\"\r\n\r\nMy mother shook her head thoughtfully, and turned the frock to the other\r\nside of the light.\r\n\r\n\"Because, forsooth,\" cried my father, exploding--\"because the Etrurians\r\ncalled their gods 'the Æsar,' and the Scandinavians called  theirs 'the\r\nÆsir, or Aser! And where do you think he puts their cradle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cradle!\" said my mother, dreamingly--\"it  must be in the nursery.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"Exactly--in the nursery of the human race--just here,\"\r\nand my father pointed to the globe; \"bounded, you see, by the River\r\nHalys, and in that region which, taking its name from Ees or As, (a word\r\ndesignating light or fire) has been immemorially called _Asia_. Now,\r\nKitty, from Ees or As our ethnological speculator would derive not only\r\nAsia, the land, but Æsar or Aser, its primitive inhabitants. Hence he\r\nsupposes the origin of the Etrurians and the Scandinavians. But, if we\r\ngive him so much, we must give him more, and deduce from the same origin\r\nthe Es of the Celt, and the Ized of the Persian, and--what will be of\r\nmore use to him, I dare say, poor man, than all the rest put\r\ntogether--the Æs of the Romans, that is, the God of Copper-Money--a very\r\npowerful household god he is to this day!\"\r\n\r\nMy mother looked musingly at her frock, as if she were taking my father's\r\nProposition into serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"So, perhaps,\" resumed my father, \"and not unconformably with sacred\r\nrecords, from one great parent horde came all these various tribes,\r\ncarrying with them the name of their beloved Asia; and whether they\r\nwandered north, south, or west, exalting their own emphatic designation\r\nof 'Children of the Land of Light' into the title of gods. And to think,\r\n(added Mr. Caxton pathetically, gazing upon that speck in the globe on\r\nwhich his forefinger rested,)--to think how little they changed for the\r\nbetter when they got to the Don, or entangled their rafts amidst the\r\nicebergs of the Baltic--so comfortably off as they were here, if they\r\ncould but have stayed quiet!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why the deuce could not they?\" asked Mr. Squills.\r\n\r\n\"Pressure of population, and not enough to live upon, I suppose,\" said my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, sulkily.--\"More probably they did away with the Corn Laws,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papæ!\" quoth my father, \"that throws a new light on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, full of his grievances, and not caring three straws about\r\nthe origin of the Scandinavians.--\"I know that if we are to lose £500\r\nevery year on a farm which we hold rent free, and which the best judges\r\nallow to be a perfect model for the whole country, we had better make\r\nhaste and turn Æsar or Aser, or whatever you call them, and fix a\r\nsettlement on the property of other nations, otherwise I suspect our\r\nprobable settlement will be on the parish.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills_, who, it must be remembered, is an enthusiastic\r\nFree-trader.--\"You have only got to put more capital on the land.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"Well, Mr. Squills, as you think so well of that\r\ninvestment, put _your_ capital on it. I promise that you shall have every\r\nshilling of profit.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills_, hastily retreating behind _The Times_.--\"I don't think the\r\nGreat Western can fall any lower; though it is hazardous--I can but\r\nventure a few hundreds--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"On our land, Squills? Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills_.--\"No, no--anything but that-on the Great Western.\"\r\n\r\nPisistratus relapses into gloom. Blanche steals up coaxingly, and gets\r\nsnubbed for her pains. A pause.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_--\"There are two golden rules of life; one relates to the\r\nmind, and the other to the pockets. The first is--If our thoughts get\r\ninto a low, nervous, aguish condition, we should make them change the\r\nair; the second is comprised in the proverb, 'it is good to have two\r\nstrings to one's bow.' Therefore, Pisistratus, I tell you what you must\r\ndo--Write a Book!\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"Write a Book!--Against the abolition of the Corn Laws?\r\nFaith, sir, the mischief's done. It takes a much better pen than mine to\r\nwrite down an Act of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"I only said, 'Write a Book.' All the rest is the addition\r\nof your own headlong imagination.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, with the recollection of The Great Book rising before\r\nhim.--\"Indeed, sir I should think that would just finish us!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, not seeming to heed the interruption.--\"A book that will\r\nsell! A book that will prop up the fall of prices! A book that will\r\ndistract your mind from its dismal apprehensions, and restore your\r\naffection to your species, and your hopes in the ultimate triumph of\r\nsound principles--by the sight of a favorable balance at the end of the\r\nyearly accounts. It is astonishing what a difference that little\r\ncircumstance makes in our views of things in general. I remember when the\r\nbank in which Squills had incautiously left £1000 broke, one remarkably\r\nhealthy year, that he became a great alarmist, and said that the country\r\nwas on the verge of ruin; whereas, you see now, when, thanks to a long\r\nsuccession of sickly seasons, he has a surplus capital to risk in the\r\nGreat Western--he is firmly persuaded that England was never in so\r\nProsperous a condition.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills_, rather sullenly.--\"Pooh, pooh.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"Write a book, my son--write a book. Need I tell you that\r\nMoney or Moneta, according to Hyginus, was the mother of the Muses? Write\r\na book.\"\r\n\r\n_Blanche_ and my _Mother_, in full chorus.--\"Oh yes, Sisty--a book-a\r\nbook! you must write a book.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" quoth my Uncle Roland, slamming down the volume he had just\r\nconcluded, \"he could write a devilish deal better book than this; and how\r\nI come to read such trash, night after night, is more than I could\r\nPossibly explain to the satisfaction of any intelligent jury, if I were\r\nput into a witness-box, and examined in the mildest manner by my own\r\ncounsel.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"You see that Roland tells us exactly what sort of a book\r\nit shall be.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"Trash, sir?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"No--that is not necessarily trash--but a book of that\r\nclass which, whether trash or not, people can't help reading. Novels have\r\nbecome the necessity of the age. You must write a novel.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, flattered, but dubious.--\"A novel! But every subject on\r\nwhich novels can be written is preoccupied. There are novels on low life,\r\nnovels of high life, military novels, naval novels, novels philosophical,\r\nnovels religious, novels historical, novels descriptive of India, the\r\nColonies, Ancient Rome, and the Egyptian Pyramids. From what bird, wild\r\neagle, or barn-door fowl, can I\r\n\r\n  \"'Pluck one unwearied plume from Fancy's wing!'\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, after a little thought.--\"You remember the story which\r\nTrevanion (I beg his pardon, Lord Ulswater) told us the other night. That\r\ngives you something of the romance of real life for your plot--puts you\r\nchiefly among scenes with which you are familiar, and furnishes you with\r\ncharacters which have been sparingly dealt with since the time of\r\nFielding. You can give us the country squire, as you remember him in your\r\nyouth: it is a specimen of a race worth preserving--the old\r\nidiosyncrasies of which are rapidly dying off, as the railways bring\r\nNorfolk and Yorkshire within easy reach of the manners of London. You can\r\ngive us the old-fashioned parson, as in all essentials he may yet be\r\nfound--but before you had to drag him out of the great Puseyite sectarian\r\nbog; and, for the rest, I really think that while, as I am told, many\r\npopular writers are doing their best, especially in France, and perhaps a\r\nlittle in England, to set class against class, and pick up every stone in\r\nthe kennel to shy at a gentleman with a good coat on his back, something\r\nuseful might be done by a few good-humored sketches of those innocent\r\ncriminals a little better off than their neighbors, whom, however we\r\ndislike them, I take it for granted we shall have to endure, in one shape\r\nor another, as long as civilization exists; and they seem, on the whole,\r\nas good in their present shape as we are likely to get, shake the dice\r\nbox of society how we will.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"Very well said, sir; but this rural country gentleman\r\nlife is not so new as you think. There's Washington Irving--\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"Charming--but rather the manners of the last century than\r\nthis. You may as well cite Addison and Sir Roger de Coverley.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"_Tremaine_ and _De Vere_.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"Nothing can be more graceful, nor more unlike what I\r\nmean. The Pales and Terminus I wish you to put up in the fields are\r\nfamiliar images, that you may cut out of an oak tree--not beautiful\r\nmarble statues on porphyry pedestals twenty feet high.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_.--\"Miss Austin; Mrs. Gore in her masterpiece of _Mrs.\r\nArmytage_; Mrs. Marsh, too; and then (for Scottish manners) Miss\r\nFerrier!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, growing cross.--\"Oh, if you cannot treat on bucolics but\r\nwhat you must hear some Virgil or other cry 'Stop thief,' you deserve to\r\nbe tossed by one of your own 'short-horns.'--(Still more\r\ncontemptuously)--I am sure I don't know why we spend so much money on\r\nsending our sons to school to learn Latin, when that Anchronism of yours,\r\nMrs. Caxton, can't even construe a line and a half of Phædrus. Phædrus,\r\nMrs. Caxton--a book which is in Latin what Goody Two Shoes is in the\r\nvernacular!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Caxton_, alarmed and indignant.--\"Fie, Austin! I am sure you can\r\nconstrue Phædrus, dear!\"\r\n\r\nPisistratus prudently preserves silence.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_.--\"I'll try him--\r\n\r\n  \"'Sua cuique quum sit animi cogitatio\r\n  Colorque proprius.'\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, smiling.--\"That every man has some coloring matter within\r\nhim, to give his own tinge to--\"\r\n\r\n\"His own novel,\" interrupted my father! \"_Contentus peragis_.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of this dialogue, Blanche had sewn together three\r\nquires of the best Bath paper, and she now placed them on a little table\r\nbefore me, with her own inkstand and steel pen.\r\n\r\nMy mother put her finger to her lip, and said, \"Hush!\" my father returned\r\nto the cradle of the Æsar; Captain Roland leant his cheek on his hand,\r\nand gazed abstractedly on the fire; Mr. Squills felt into a placid doze;\r\nand, after three sighs that would have melted a heart of stone, I rushed\r\ninto--MY NOVEL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\"There has never been occasion to use them since I have been in the\r\nParish,\" said Parson Dale.\r\n\r\n\"What does that prove?\" quoth the Squire sharply, and looking the Parson\r\nfull in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Prove!\" repeated Mr. Dale--with a smile of benign, yet too conscious\r\nsuperiority--\"What does experience prove?\"\r\n\r\n\"That your forefathers were great blockheads, and that their descendant\r\nis not a whit the wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Squire,\" replied the Parson, \"although that is a melancholy conclusion,\r\nyet if you mean it to apply universally, and not to the family of the\r\nDales in particular, it is not one which my candor as a reasoner, and my\r\nHumility as a mortal, will permit me to challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I defy you,\" said Mr. Hazledean triumphantly. \"But to stick to the\r\nsubject, which it is monstrous hard to do when one talks with a parson, I\r\nonly just ask you to look yonder, and tell me on your conscience--I don't\r\neven say as a parson, but as a parishioner--whether you ever saw a more\r\ndisreputable spectacle?\"\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, the Squire, leaning heavily on the Parson's left\r\nshoulder, extended his cane in a line parallel with the right of that\r\ndisputatious ecclesiastic, so that he might guide the organ of sight to\r\nthe object he had thus flatteringly described.\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said the Parson, \"that, regarded by the eye of the senses,\r\nit is a thing that in its best day had small pretensions to beauty, and\r\nis not elevated into the Picturesque even by neglect and decay. But, my\r\nfriend, regarded by the eye of the inner man--of the rural philosopher\r\nand parochial legislator--I say it is by neglect and decay that it is\r\nrendered a very pleasing feature in what I may call 'the moral topography\r\nof a parish.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire looked at the Parson as if be could have beaten him; and\r\nindeed, regarding the object in dispute not only with the eye of the\r\nouter man, but the eye of law and order, the eye of a country gentleman\r\nand a justice of the peace, the spectacle _was_ scandalously\r\ndisreputable. It was moss-grown; it was worm-eaten; it was broken right\r\nin the middle; through its four socketless eyes, neighbored by the\r\nnettle, peered the thistle:--the thistle!--a forest of thistles!--and, to\r\ncomplete the degradation of the whole, those thistles had attracted the\r\ndonkey of an itinerant tinker; and the irreverent animal was in the very\r\nact of taking his luncheon out of the eyes and jaws of--THE PARISH\r\nSTOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe Squire looked as if he could have beaten the Parson; but as he was\r\nnot without some slight command of temper, and a substitute was luckily\r\nat hand, he gulped down, his resentment and made a rush--at the donkey!\r\n\r\nNow the donkey was hampered by a rope to its fore feet, to the which was\r\nattached a billet of wood called technically \"a clog,\" so that it had no\r\nfair chance of escape from the assault its sacrilegious luncheon had\r\njustly provoked. But, the ass turned round with unusual nimbleness at the\r\nfirst stroke of the cane, the Squire caught his foot in the rope, and\r\nwent head over heels among the thistles. The donkey gravely bent down,\r\nand thrice smelt or sniffed its prostrate foe; then, having convinced\r\nitself that it had nothing farther to apprehend for the present, and very\r\nwilling to make the best of the reprieve, according to the poetical\r\nadmonition, \"Gather your rosebuds while you may,\" it cropped a thistle in\r\nfull bloom, close to the ear of the Squire; so close indeed, that the\r\nParson thought the ear was gone; and with the more probability, inasmuch\r\nas the Squire, feeling the warm breath of the creature, bellowed out with\r\nall the force of lungs accustomed to give a view-hallo!\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, is it gone?\" said the Parson, thrusting his person between the\r\nass and the Squire.\r\n\r\n\"Zounds and the devil!\" cried the Squire, rubbing himself as be rose to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said the Parson gently. \"What a horrible oath!\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible oath! If you had my nankeens on,\" said the Squire, still rubbing\r\nhimself, \"and had fallen into a thicket of thistles with a donkey's teeth\r\nwithin an inch of your ear!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not gone--then?\" interrupted the Parson.\r\n\r\n\"No--that is, I think not,\" interrupted the Squire dubiously; and he\r\nclapped his hand to the organ in question. \"No, it is not gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven!\" said the good clergyman kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" growled the Squire, who was now once more engaged in rubbing\r\nhimself. \"Thank heaven indeed, when I am as full of thorns as a\r\nporcupine! I should just like to know what use thistles are in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"For donkeys to eat, if you will let them, Squire,\" answered the Parson.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, you beast!\" cried Mr. Hazeldean, all his wrath reawakened,\r\nwhether by the reference to the donkey species, or his inability to\r\nreply to the Parson, or perhaps by some sudden prick too sharp for\r\nhumanity--especially humanity in nankeens--to endure without kicking;\r\n\"Ugh, you beast!\" he exclaimed, shaking his cane at the donkey, who, at\r\nthe interposition of the Parson, had respectfully recoiled a few paces,\r\nand now stood switching his thin tail, and trying vainly to lift one of\r\nits fore legs--for the flies teased it.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing!\" said the Parson pityingly. \"See, it has a raw place on the\r\nshoulder, and the flies have found out the sore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am devilish glad to hear it,\" said the Squire vindictively.\r\n\r\n\"Fie, fie!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very well to say 'Fie, fie.' It was not you who fell among the\r\nthistles. What's the man about now, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson had walked toward a chestnut tree that stood on the village\r\ngreen--he broke off a bough--returned to the donkey, whisked off the\r\nflies, and then tenderly placed the broad leaves over the sore, as a\r\nprotection from the swarms. The donkey turned round its head, and looked\r\nat him with mild wonder.\r\n\r\n\"I would bet a shilling,\" said the Parson, softly, \"that this is the\r\nfirst act of kindness thou hast met with this many a day. And slight\r\nenough it is, Heaven knows.\"\r\n\r\nWith that the Parson put his hand into his pocket, and drew out an apple.\r\nIt was a fine large rose-cheeked apple: one of the last winter's store,\r\nfrom the celebrated tree in the parsonage garden, and he was taking it as\r\na present to a little boy in the village who had notably distinguished\r\nhimself in the Sunday-school. \"Nay, in common justice, Lenny Fairfield\r\nshould have the preference,\" muttered the Parson. The ass pricked up one\r\nof his ears, and advanced its head timidly. \"But Lenny Fairfield would be\r\nas much pleased with twopence: and what could twopence do to thee?\" The\r\nass's nose now touched the apple. \"Take it in the flame of charity,\"\r\nquoth the Parson, \"Justice is accustomed to be served last:\" And the ass\r\ntook the apple. \"How had you the heart?\" said the Parson, pointing to the\r\nSquire's cane.\r\n\r\nThe ass stopped munching, and looked askant at the Squire.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! eat on; he'll not beat thee now!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Squire apologetically. \"But, after all, he is not an ass\r\nof the parish; he is a vagrant, and he ought to be pounded. But the pound\r\nis in as bad a state as the stocks, thanks to your new-fashioned\r\ndoctrines.\"\r\n\r\n\"New-fashioned!\" cried the Parson almost indignantly, for he had a great\r\ndisdain of new fashions. \"They are as old as Christianity; nay, as old as\r\nParadise, which you will observe is derived from a Greek, or rather a\r\nPersian word, and means something more than a 'garden,' corresponding\r\n(pursued the Parson rather pedantically) with the Latin _vivarium_--viz.\r\ngrove or park full of innocent dumb creatures. Depend on it, donkeys were\r\nallowed to eat thistles there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly,\" said the Squire drily. \"But Hazeldean, though a very\r\npretty village, is not Paradise. The stocks shall be mended to-morrow\r\nday, and the pound too--and the next donkey found trespassing shall go\r\ninto it, as sure as my name is Hazeldean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Parson gravely, \"I can only hope that the next parish\r\nmay not follow your example; or that you and I may never be caught\r\nstraying!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nParson Dale and Squire Hazeldean parted company; the latter to inspect\r\nhis sheep, the former to visit some of his parishioners, including Lenny\r\nFairfield, whom the donkey had defrauded of his apple.\r\n\r\nLenny Fairfield was sure to be in the way, for his mother rented a few\r\nacres of grass land from the Squire, and it was now hay-time. And\r\nLeonard, commonly called Lenny, was an only son, and his mother a widow.\r\nThe cottage stood apart, and somewhat remote, in one of the many nooks of\r\nthe long green village lane. And a thoroughly English cottage it\r\nwas--three centuries old at least; with walls of rubble let into oak\r\nframes, and duly whitewashed every summer, a thatched roof, small panes\r\nof glass, and an old doorway raised from the ground by two steps. There\r\nwas about this little dwelling all the homely rustic elegance which\r\npeasant life admits of: a honeysuckle was trained over the door; a few\r\nflower-pots were placed on the window-sills; the small plot of ground in\r\nfront of the house was kept with great neatness, and even taste; some\r\nlarge rough stones on either side the little path having been formed into\r\na sort of rock-work, with creepers that were now in flower; and the\r\npotatoe ground was screened from the eye by sweet peas and lupine. Simple\r\nelegance all this, it is true; but how well it speaks for peasant and\r\nlandlord, when you see that the peasant is fond of his home, and has some\r\nspare time and heart to bestow upon mere embellishment. Such a peasant is\r\nsure to be a bad customer to the ale-house, and a safe neighbor to the\r\nSquire's preserves. All honor and praise to him, except a small tax upon\r\nboth, which is due to the landlord!\r\n\r\nSuch sights were as pleasant to the Parson as the most beautiful\r\nlandscapes of Italy can be to the dilettante. He paused a moment at the\r\nwicket to look around him, and distended his nostrils voluptuously to\r\ninhale the smell of the sweet peas, mixed with that of the new-mown hay\r\nin the fields behind, which a slight breeze bore to him. He then moved\r\non, carefully scraped his shoes, clean and well polished as they\r\nwere--for Mr. Dale was rather a beau in his own clerical way--on the\r\nscraper without the door, and lifted the latch.\r\n\r\nYour virtuoso looks with artistical delight on the figure of some nymph\r\npainted on an Etruscan vase, engaged in pouring out the juice of the\r\ngrape from her classic urn. And the Parson felt as harmless, if not as\r\nelegant a pleasure in contemplating Widow Fairfield brimming high a\r\nglittering can, which she designed for the refreshment of the thirsty\r\nhay-makers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairfield was a middle-aged tidy woman, with that alert precision of\r\nmovement which seems to come from an active orderly mind; and as she now\r\nturned her head briskly at the sound of the Parson's footsteps, she\r\nshowed a countenance prepossessing, though not handsome,--a countenance\r\nfrom which a pleasant hearty smile, breaking forth at that moment,\r\neffaced some lines that, in repose, spoke \"of sorrows, but of sorrows\r\npast;\" and her cheek, paler than is common to the complexions even of the\r\nfair sex, when born and bred amidst a rural population, might have\r\nfavored the guess that the earlier part of her life had been spent in the\r\nlanguid air and \"within doors\" occupation of a town.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me,\" said the Parson, as Mrs. Fairfield dropped her quick\r\ncourtesy, and smoothed her apron; \"if you are going into the hayfield, I\r\nwill go with you; I have something to say to Lenny--an excellent boy.\"\r\n\r\n_Widow._--\"Well, sir, and you are kind to say it--but so he is.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._-\"He reads uncommonly well, he writes tolerably; he is the best\r\nlad in the whole school at his catechism and in the Bible lessons; and I\r\nassure you, when I see his face at church, looking up so attentively, I\r\nfancy that I shall read my sermon all the better for such a listener!\"\r\n\r\n_Widow_, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.--\"Deed, sir, when\r\nmy poor Mark died, I never thought I could have lived on as I have done.\r\nBut that boy is so kind and good, that when I look at him sitting there\r\nin dear Mark's chair, and remember how Mark loved him, and all he used to\r\nsay to me about him, I feel somehow or other as if my goodman smiled on\r\nme, and would rather I was not with him yet, till the lad had grown up,\r\nand did not want me any more.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson_, looking away, and after a pause.--\"You never hear anything of\r\nthe old folks at Lansmere?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Deed, sir, sin' poor Mark died, they han't noticed me, nor the boy;\r\nbut,\" added the widow, with all a peasant's pride, \"it isn't that I wants\r\ntheir money; only it's hard to feel strange like to one's own father and\r\nmother!\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"You must excuse them. Your father, Mr. Avenel, was never\r\nquite the same man after that sad event,--but you are weeping, my friend,\r\npardon me:--your mother is a little proud; but so are you, though in\r\nanother way.\"\r\n\r\n_Widow._--\"I proud! Lord love ye, sir, I have not a bit of pride in me!\r\nand that's the reason they always looked down on me.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Your parents must be well off; and I shall apply to them in a\r\nyear or two in behalf of Lenny, for they promised me to provide for him\r\nwhen he grew up, as they ought.\"\r\n\r\n_Widow_, with flashing eyes.--\"I am sure, sir, I hope you will do no such\r\nthing; for I would not have Lenny beholden to them as has never given him\r\na kind word sin' he was born!\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson smiled gravely and shook his head at poor Mrs. Fairfield's\r\nhasty confutation of her own self-acquittal from the charge of pride; but\r\nhe saw that it was not the time or moment for effectual peace-making in\r\nthe most irritable of all rancors, viz., that nourished against one's\r\nnearest relations. He therefore dropped the subject, and said,--\"Well,\r\ntime enough to think of Lenny's future prospects; meanwhile we are\r\nforgetting the haymakers. Come.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow opened the back door, which led across a little apple orchard\r\ninto the fields.\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"You have a pleasant place here; and I see that my friend\r\nLenny should be in no want of apples. I had brought him one, but I have\r\ngiven it away on the road.\"\r\n\r\n_Widow._--\"Oh, sir, it is not the deed--it is the will; as I felt when\r\nthe Squire, God bless him! took two pounds off the rent the year he-that\r\nis, Mark--died.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"If Lenny continues to be such a help to you, it will not be\r\nlong before the Squire may put the two pounds on again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the widow simply; \"I hope he will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly woman!\" muttered the Parson. \"That's not exactly what the\r\nschoolmistress would have said. You don't read nor write, Mrs. Fairfield;\r\nyet you express yourself with great propriety.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Mark was a schollard, sir, like my poor, poor, sister; and\r\nthough I was a sad stupid girl afore I married, I tried to take after him\r\nwhen we came together.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThey were now in the hayfield, and a boy of about sixteen, but, like most\r\ncountry lads, to appearance much younger than he was, looked up from his\r\nrake, with lively blue eyes, beaming forth under a profusion of brown\r\ncurly hair.\r\n\r\nLeonard Fairfield was indeed a very handsome boy--not so stout nor so\r\nruddy as one would choose for the ideal of rustic beauty; nor yet so\r\ndelicate in limb and keen in expression as are those children of cities,\r\nin whom the mind is cultivated at the expense of the body; but still he\r\nhad the health of the country in his cheeks, and was not without the\r\ngrace of the city in his compact figure and easy movements. There was in\r\nhis physiognomy something interesting from its peculiar character of\r\ninnocence and simplicity. You could see that he had been brought up by a\r\nwoman, and much apart from familiar contact with other children; and such\r\nintelligence as was yet developed in him, was not ripened by the jokes\r\nand cuffs of his coevals, but fostered by decorous lecturings from his\r\nelders, and good little boy maxims in good little boy books.\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Come hither, Lenny. You know the benefit of school, I see: it\r\ncan teach you nothing better than to be a support to your mother.\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny_, looking down sheepishly, and with a heightened glow over his\r\nface.--\"Please, sir, that may come one of these days.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"That's right, Lenny. Let me see! why you must be nearly a\r\nman. How old are you?\"\r\n\r\nLenny looks up inquiringly at his mother.\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"You ought to know, Lenny, speak for yourself. Hold your\r\ntongue, Mrs. Fairfield.\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny_, twirling his hat, and in great perplexity.--\"Well, and there is\r\nFlop, neighbor Dutton's old sheep-dog. He be very old now.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"I am not asking Flop's age, but your own.\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny._-\"'Deed, sir, I have heard say as how Flop and I were pups\r\ntogether. That is, I--I--\"\r\n\r\nFor the Parson is laughing, and so is Mrs. Fairfield; and the haymakers\r\nwho have stood still to listen, are laughing too. And poor Lenny has\r\nquite lost his head, and looks as if he would like to cry.\r\n\r\n_Parson_, patting the curly locks, encouragingly.--\"Never mind; it is not\r\nso badly answered after all. And how old is Flop?\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny._--\"Why, he must be fifteen year and more.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"How old, then, are you?\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny_, looking up with a beam of intelligence.--\"Fifteen year and\r\nmore!\"\r\n\r\nWidow sighs and nods her head.\r\n\r\n\"That's what we call putting two and two together,\" said the Parson. \"Or,\r\nin other words,\" and here be raised his eyes majestically toward the\r\nhaymakers--\"in other words--thanks to his love for his book--simple as he\r\nstands here, Lenny Fairfield has shown himself capable of INDUCTIVE\r\nRATIOCINATION.\"\r\n\r\nAt those words, delivered _ore rotundo_, the haymakers ceased laughing.\r\nFor even in lay matters they held the Parson to be an oracle, and words\r\nso long must have a great deal in them.\r\n\r\nLenny drew tip his head proudly.\r\n\r\n\"You are very fond of Flop, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Deed he is,\" said the Widow, \"and of all poor dumb creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Suppose, my lad, that you had a fine apple, and you met a\r\nfriend who wanted it more than you; what would you do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please you, sir, I would give him half of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson's face fell.--\"Not the whole, Lenny?\"\r\n\r\nLenny considered.--\"If he was a friend, sir, he would not like me to give\r\nhim all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Master Leonard, you speak so well, that I must e'en tell\r\nthe truth. I brought you an apple, as a prize for good conduct in school.\r\nBut I met by the way a poor donkey, and some one beat him for eating a\r\nthistle; so I thought I would make it up by giving him the apple. Ought I\r\nonly to have given him the half?\"\r\n\r\nLenny's innocent face became all smile; his interest was aroused. \"And\r\ndid the donkey like the apple?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much,\" said the Parson, fumbling in his pocket, but thinking of\r\nLeonard Fairield's years and understanding; and moreover, observing, in\r\nthe pride of his heart, that here were many spectators to his deed, he\r\nthought the meditated twopence not sufficient, and he generously produced\r\na silver sixpence.\r\n\r\n\"There, my man, that will pay for the half apple which you would have\r\nkept for yourself.\" The Parson again patted the curly locks, and, after a\r\nhearty word or two with the other haymakers, and a friendly \"Good day\" to\r\nMrs. Fairfield, struck into a path that led toward his own glebe.\r\n\r\nHe had just crossed the stile, when, he heard hasty but timorous feet\r\nbehind him. He turned and saw his friend Lenny.\r\n\r\n_Lenny_, half crying and holding out the sixpence.--\"Indeed, sir, I would\r\nrather not. I would have given all to the Neddy.\"\r\n\r\n_Parson._--\"Why, then, my man, you have a still greater right to the\r\nsixpence.\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny._--\"No, sir; 'cause you only gave it to make up for the half\r\napple. And if I had given the whole, as I ought to have done, why, I\r\nshould have had no right to the sixpence. Please, sir, don't be offended;\r\ndo take it back, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson hesitated. And the boy thrust the sixpence into his hand, as\r\nthe ass had poked his nose there before in quest of the apple.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Parson Dale, soliloquizing, \"that if one don't give Justice\r\nthe first place at the table, all the other Virtues eat up her share.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the case was perplexing. Charity, like a forward impudent baggage\r\nas she is, always thrusting herself in the way, and taking other people's\r\napples to make her own little pie, had defrauded Lenny of his due; and\r\nnow Susceptibility, who looks like a shy, blush-faced, awkward Virtue in\r\nher teens--but who, nevertheless, is always engaged in picking the\r\npockets of her sisters, tried to filch from him his lawful recompense.\r\nThe case was perplexing; for the Parson held Susceptibility in great\r\nhonor, despite her hypocritical tricks, and did not like to give her a\r\nslap in the face, which might frighten her away forever. So Mr. Dale\r\nstood irresolute, glancing from the sixpence to Lenny, and from Lenny to\r\nthe sixpence.\r\n\r\n\"_Buon giorno_--good day to you,\" said a voice behind, in an accent\r\nslightly but unmistakably foreign, and a strange-looking figure presented\r\nitself at the stile.\r\n\r\nImagine a tall and exceedingly meager man, dressed in a rusty suit of\r\nblack--the pantaloons tight at the calf and ancle, and there forming a\r\nloose gaiter over thick shoes buckled high at the instep; an old cloak,\r\nlined with red, was thrown over one shoulder, though the day was sultry;\r\na quaint, red, outlandish umbrella, with a carved brass handle, was\r\nthrust under one arm, though the sky was cloudless; a profusion of raven\r\nhair, in waving curls that seemed as fine as silk, escaped from the sides\r\nof a straw-hat of prodigious brim; a complexion sallow and swarthy, and\r\nfeatures which, though not without considerable beauty to the eye of the\r\nartist, were not only unlike what we fair, well-fed, neat-faced\r\nEnglishmen are wont to consider comely, but exceedingly like what we are\r\ndisposed to regard as awful and Satanic--to wit, a long hooked nose,\r\nsunken cheeks, black eyes, whose piercing brilliancy took something\r\nwizard-like and mystical from the large spectacles through which they\r\nshone; a mouth round which played an ironical smile, and in which a\r\nphysiognomist would have remarked singular shrewdness and some closeness,\r\ncomplete the picture: Imagine this figure, grotesque, peregrinate; and to\r\nthe eye of a peasant certainly diabolical, then perch it on the stile in\r\nthe midst of those green English fields, and in sight of that primitive\r\nEnglish village; there let it sit straddling, its long legs dangling\r\ndown, a short German pipe emitting clouds from one corner of those\r\nsardonic lips, its dark eyes glaring through the spectacles full upon the\r\nParson, yet askant upon Lenny Fairfield. Lenny Fairfield looked\r\nexceedingly frightened.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Dr. Riccabocca.\" said Mr. Dale, smiling, \"you come in good\r\ntime to solve a very nice question in casuistry;\" and herewith the Parson\r\nexplained the case, and put the question--\"Ought Lenny Fairfield to have\r\nthe sixpence, or ought he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto_!\" said the Doctor. \"If the hen would but hold her tongue,\r\nnobody would know that she had laid an egg.\"\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" said the Parson; \"but what follows? The saying is good, but I\r\ndon't see the application.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pardons!\" replied Dr. Riccabocca, with all the urbanity of an\r\nItalian; \"but it seems to me, that if you had given the sixpence to the\r\n_fanciullo_--that is, to this good little boy--without telling him the\r\nstory about the donkey, you would never have put him and yourself into\r\nthis awkward dilemma.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear sir,\" whispered the Parson, mildly, as he inclined his lips\r\nto the Doctors ear, \"I should then have lost the opportunity of\r\ninculcating a moral lesson--you understand.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca shrugged his shoulders, restored his pipe to his mouth,\r\nand took a long whiff. It was a whiff eloquent, though cynical--a whiff\r\npeculiar to your philosophical smoker--a whiff that implied the most\r\nabsolute but the most placid incredulity as to the effect of the Parson's\r\nmoral lesson.\r\n\r\n\"Still you have not given us your decision,\" said the Parson, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor withdrew the pipe. \"_Cospetto_!\" said he. \"He who scrubs the\r\nhead of an ass wastes his soap.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you scrubbed mine fifty times over with those enigmatical proverbs of\r\nyours,\" said the Parson testily, \"you would not make it any the wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sir,\" said the Doctor, bowing low from his perch on the stile,\r\n\"I never presumed to say that there were more asses than in the story;\r\nbut I thought I could not better explain my meaning, which is simply\r\nthis--you scrubbed the ass's head, and therefore you must lose the soap.\r\nLet the _fanciullo_ have the sixpence; and a great sum it is, too, for a\r\nlittle boy, who may spend it all upon pocket-money!\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Lenny--you hear?\" said the Parson, stretching out the sixpence.\r\nBut Lenny retreated, and cast on the umpire a look of great aversion and\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Master Dale,\" said he, obstinately, \"I'd rather not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a matter of feeling, you see,\" said the Parson, turning to the\r\numpire; \"and I believe the boy is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is a matter of feeling,\" replied Dr. Riccabocca, \"there is no more\r\nto be said on it. When Feeling comes in at the door, Reason has nothing\r\nto do but to jump out of the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, my good boy,\" said the Parson, pocketing the coin; \"but stop! Give\r\nme your hand first. _There_--I understand you--good-by!\"\r\n\r\nLenny's eyes glistened as the Parson shook him by the hand, and, not\r\ntrusting himself to speak, he walked off sturdily. The Parson wiped his\r\nforehead, and sat himself down on the stile beside the Italian. The view\r\nbefore them was lovely, and both enjoyed it (though not equally) enough\r\nto be silent for some moments. On the other side the lane, seen between\r\ngaps in the old oaks and chestnuts that hung over the moss-grown pales of\r\nHazeldean Park, rose gentle verdant slopes, dotted with sheep and herds\r\nof deer; a stately avenue stretched far away to the left, and ended at\r\nthe right hand, within a few yards of a ha-ha that divided the park from\r\na level sward of table-land gay with shrubs and flower-pots, relieved by\r\nthe shade of two mighty cedars. And on this platform, only seen in part,\r\nstood the Squire's old-fashioned house, red brick, with stone mullions,\r\ngable-ends, and quaint chimney-pots. On this side the road, immediately\r\nfacing the two gentlemen, cottage after cottage whitely emerged from the\r\ncurves in the lane, while, beyond, the ground declining gave an extensive\r\nprospect of woods and cornfields, spires and farms. Behind, from a belt\r\nof lilacs and evergreens, you caught a peep of the parsonage-house,\r\nbacked by woodlands, and a little noisy rill running in front. The birds\r\nwere still in the hedgerows, only, as if from the very heart of the most\r\ndistant woods, there came now and then the mellow note of the cuckoo.\r\n\r\n\"Verily,\" said Mr. Dale softly, \"my lot has fallen on a goodly heritage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian twitched his cloak over him, and sighed almost inaudibly.\r\nPerhaps he thought of his own Summer Land, and felt that amidst all that\r\nfresh verdure of the North, there was no heritage for the stranger.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the Parson could notice the sigh or conjecture the cause,\r\nDr. Riccabocca's thin lips took an expression almost malignant.\r\n\r\n_\"Per Bacco!\"_ said he; \"in every country I find that the rooks settle\r\nwhere the trees are the finest. I am sure that, when Noah first landed on\r\nArarat, he must have found some gentleman in black already settled in the\r\npleasantest part of the mountain, and waiting for his tenth of the cattle\r\nas they came out of the Ark.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson turned his meek eyes to the philosopher, and there was in them\r\nsomething so deprecating rather than reproachful, that Dr. Riccabocca\r\nturned away his face and refilled his pipe. Dr. Riccabocca abhorred\r\npriests; but though Parson Dale was emphatically a parson, he seemed at\r\nthat moment so little of what Dr. Riccabocca understood by a priest, that\r\nthe Italian's heart smote him for his irreverent jest on the cloth.\r\nLuckily at this moment there was a diversion to that untoward\r\ncommencement of conversation, in the appearance of no less a personage\r\nthan the donkey himself--I mean the donkey who ate the apple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tinker was a stout swarthy fellow, jovial and musical withal, for he\r\nwas singing a stave as he flourished his staff, and at the end of each\r\n_refrain_ down came the staff on the quarters of the donkey. The Tinker\r\nwent behind and sung, the donkey went before and was thwacked.\r\n\r\n\"Yours is a droll country,\" quoth Dr. Riccabocca; \"in mine it is not the\r\nass that walks first in the procession, who gets the blows.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson jumped from the stile, and, looking over the hedge that\r\ndivided the field from the road-\"Gently, gently,\" said he; \"the sound of\r\nthe stick spoils the singing! O Mr. Sprott, Mr. Sprott! a good man is\r\nmerciful to his beast.\"\r\n\r\nThe donkey seemed to recognize the voice of its friend, for it stopped\r\nshort, pricked one ear wistfully, and looked up.\r\n\r\nThe Tinker touched his hat, and looked up too. \"Lord bless your\r\nreverence! he does not mind it, he likes it. I would not hurt thee; would\r\nI, Neddy?\"\r\n\r\nThe donkey shook his head and shivered; perhaps a fly had settled on the\r\nsore, which the chestnut leaves no longer protected.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you did not mean to hurt him, Sprott,\" said the Parson, more\r\npolitely I fear than honestly--for he had seen enough of that\r\ncross-grained thing called the human heart, even in the little world of a\r\ncountry parish, to know that it requires management, and coaxing, and\r\nflattering, to interfere successfully between a man and his own\r\ndonkey--\"I am sure you did not mean to hurt him; but he has already got a\r\nsore on his shoulder as big as my hand, poor thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord love 'un! yes; that vas done a playing with the manger, the day I\r\ngave 'un oats!\" said the Tinker.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca adjusted his spectacles, and surveyed the ass. The ass\r\npricked up his other ear, and surveyed Dr. Riccabocca. In that mutual\r\nsurvey of physical qualifications, each being regarded according to the\r\naverage symmetry of its species, it may be doubted whether the advantage\r\nwas on the side of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe Parson had a great notion of the wisdom of his friend, in all matters\r\nnot immediately ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n\"Say a good word for the donkey!\" whispered he.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the Doctor, addressing Mr. Sprott, with a respectful\r\nsalutation, \"there's a great kettle at my house--the Casino--which wants\r\nsoldering: can you recommend me a tinker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's all in my line,\" said Sprott, \"and there ben't a tinker in\r\nthe country that I would recommend like myself, thof I say it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You jest, good sir.\" said the Doctor, smiling pleasantly. \"A man who\r\ncan't mend a hole in his own donkey, can never demean himself by patching\r\nup my great kettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, sir,\" said the Tinker, archly, \"if I had known that poor Neddy had\r\ntwo sitch friends in court, I'd have seen he was a gintleman, and treated\r\nhim as sitch.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Corpo di Bacco!\"_ quoth the Doctor, \"though that jest's not new, I\r\nthink the Tinker comes very well out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but the donkey!\" said the Parson, \"I've a great mind to buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to tell you an anecdote in point,\" said Dr. Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the Parson, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Once in a time,\" pursued Riccabocca, \"the Emperor Adrian, going to the\r\npublic baths, saw an old soldier, who had served under him, rubbing his\r\nback against the marble wall. The Emperor, who was a wise, and therefore\r\na curious, inquisitive man, sent for the soldier, and asked him why he\r\nresorted to that kind of friction. 'Because,' answered the veteran, 'I am\r\ntoo poor to have slaves to rub me down.' The Emperor was touched, and\r\ngave him slaves and money. The next day, when Adrian went to the oaths,\r\nall the old men in the city were to be seen rubbing themselves against\r\nthe marble as hard as they could. The Emperor sent for them, and asked\r\nthem the same question which he had put to the soldier; the cunning old\r\nrogues, of course, made the same answer. 'Friends,' said Adrian, 'since\r\nthere are so many of you, you will just rub one another!' Mr. Dale, if\r\nyou don't want to have all the donkeys in the county with holes in their\r\nshoulders, you had better not buy the Tinker's!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the hardest thing in the world to do the least bit of good,\"\r\ngroaned the Parson, as he broke a twig off the hedge nervously, snapped\r\nit in two, and flung the fragments on the road-one of them hit the donkey\r\non the nose. If the ass could have spoken Latin, he would have said, \"_Et\r\ntu, Brute!_\" As it was, he hung down his ears, and walked on.\r\n\r\n\"Gee hup,\" said the Tinker, and he followed the ass. Then stopping, he\r\nlooked over his shoulder, and seeing that the Parson's eyes were gazing\r\nmournfully on his _protégé_, \"Never fear, your reverence,\" cried the\r\nTinker kindly; \"I'll not spite 'un.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Four o'clock,\" cried the Parson, looking at his watch; \"half-an-hour\r\nafter dinnertime, and Mrs. Dale particularly begged me to be punctual,\r\nbecause of the fine trout the Squire sent us. Will you venture on what\r\nour homely language calls 'pot luck,' Doctor?\"\r\n\r\nNow Riccabocca, like most wise men, especially if Italians, was by no\r\nmeans inclined to the credulous view of human nature. Indeed, he was in\r\nthe habit of detecting self-interest in the simplest actions of his\r\nfellow-creatures. And when the Parson thus invited him to pot luck, he\r\nsmiled with a kind of lofty complacency; for Mrs. Dale enjoyed the\r\nreputation of having what her friends styled \"her little tempers.\" And,\r\nas well-bred ladies rarely indulge in \"little tempers\" in the presence of\r\na third person, not of the family, so Dr. Riccabocca instantly concluded\r\nthat he was invited to stand between the pot and the luck!\r\nNevertheless--as he was fond of trout, and a much more good-natured man\r\nthan he ought to have been according to his principles-he accepted the\r\nhospitality; but he did so with a sly look from over his spectacles,\r\nwhich brought a blush into the guilty cheeks of the Parson. Certainly\r\nRiccabocca had for once guessed right in his estimate of human motives.\r\n\r\nThe two walked on, crossed a little bridge that spanned the rill, and\r\nentered the parsonage lawn. Two dogs, that seemed to have sat on watch\r\nfor their master, sprang toward him barking; and the sound drew the\r\nnotice of Mrs. Dale, who, with parasol in hand, sallied out from the sash\r\nwindow which opened on the lawn. Now, O reader! I know that in thy secret\r\nheart, thou art chuckling over the want of knowledge in the sacred arcana\r\nof the domestic hearth, betrayed by the author; thou art saying to\r\nthyself, \"A pretty way to conciliate little tempers, indeed, to add to\r\nthe offense of spoiling the fish, the crime of bringing an unexpected\r\nfriend to eat it. Pot luck, quotha, when the pot's boiled over this half\r\nhour!\"\r\n\r\nBut, to thy utter shame and confusion, O reader, learn that both the\r\nauthor and Parson Dale knew very well what they were about.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca was the special favorite of Mrs. Dale, and the only person\r\nin the whole county who never put her out by dropping in. In fact,\r\nstrange though it may seem at first glance, Dr. Riccabocca had that\r\nmysterious something about him which we of his own sex can so little\r\ncomprehend, but which always propitiates the other. He owed this, in\r\npart, to his own profound but hypocritical policy; for he looked upon\r\nwoman as the natural enemy to man--against whom it was necessary to be\r\nalways on the guard: whom it was prudent to disarm by every species of\r\nfawning, servility, and abject complaisance. He owed it also, in part, to\r\nthe compassionate and heavenly nature of the angels whom his thoughts\r\nthus villanously traduced--for women like one whom they can pity without\r\ndespising; and there was something in Signer Riccabocca's poverty, in his\r\nloneliness, in his exile, whether voluntary or compelled, that excited\r\npity; while, despite the threadbare coat, the red umbrella, and the wild\r\nhair, he had, especially when addressing ladies, that air of gentleman\r\nand cavalier, which is or was more innate in an educated Italian, of\r\nwhatever rank, than perhaps in the highest aristocracy of any other\r\ncountry in Europe. For, though I grant that nothing is more exquisite\r\nthan the politeness of your French marquis of the old _régime_--nothing\r\nmore frankly gracious than the cordial address of a high-bred English\r\ngentleman--nothing more kindly prepossessing than the genial good-nature\r\nof some patriarchal German, who will condescend to forget his sixteen\r\nquarterings in the pleasure of doing you a favor--yet these specimens of\r\nthe suavity of their several nations are rare; whereas blandness and\r\npolish are common attributes with your Italian. They seem to have been\r\nimmemorially handed down to him from ancestors emulating the urbanity of\r\nCaesar, and refined by the grace of Horace.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Riccabocca consents to dine with us,\" cried the Parson hastily.\r\n\r\n\"If Madame permit!\" said the Italian, bowing over the hand extended to\r\nhim, which however he forebore to take, seeing it was already full of the\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"I am only sorry that the trout must be quite spoiled,\" began Mrs. Dale,\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the trout one thinks of when one dines with Mrs. Dale,\" said\r\nthe infamous dissimulator.\r\n\r\n\"But I see James coming to say that dinner is ready?\" observed the\r\nParson.\r\n\r\n\"He said _that_ three-quarters of an hour ago, Charles dear,\" retorted\r\nMrs. Dale, taking the arm of Dr. Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Parson and his wife are entertaining their guest, I propose to\r\nregale the reader with a small treatise apropos of that \"Charles dear,\"\r\nmurmured by Mrs. Dale;--a treatise expressly written for the benefit\r\nof THE DOMESTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nIt is an old jest that there is not a word in the language that conveys\r\nso little endearment as the word \"dear.\" But though the saying itself,\r\nlike most truths, be trite and hackneyed, no little novelty remains to\r\nthe search of the inquirer into the varieties of inimical import\r\ncomprehended in that malign monosyllable. For instance, I submit to the\r\nexperienced that the degree of hostility it betrays is in much\r\nproportioned to its collocation in the sentence. When, gliding indirectly\r\nthrough the rest of the period, it takes its stand at the close, as in\r\nthat \"Charles dear\" of Mrs. Dale--it has spilt so much of Its natural\r\nbitterness by the way that it assumes even a smile, \"amara lento temperet\r\nrisu.\" Sometimes the smile is plaintive, sometimes arch. _Ex. gr._\r\n\r\n(_Plaintive._)\r\n\r\n\"I know very well that whatever I do is wrong, Charles dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I am only glad you amused yourself so much without me, Charles\r\ndear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so loud! If you had but my poor head, Charles dear,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_Arch._\r\n\r\n\"If you _could_ spill the ink anywhere but on the best table-cloth,\r\nCharles dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"But though you must always have your own way, you are not _quite\r\nfaultless_, own, Charles dear,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn this collocation occur many dears, parental as well as conjugal;\r\nas--\"Hold up your head, and don't look quite so cross, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be a good boy for once in your life--that's a dear,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy stops in the middle of a sentence, its venom is naturally\r\nless exhausted. _Ex. gr._\r\n\r\n\"Really I must say, Charles dear, that you are the most fidgety person,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\"And if the house bills were so high last week, Charles dear, I should\r\njust like to know whose fault it was--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, Charles dear, that you could put your feet anywhere but on\r\nthe chintz sofa?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know, Charles dear, that you care no more for me and the\r\nchildren than,\" &c.\r\n\r\nBut if the fatal word spring up, in its primitive  freshness, at the head\r\nof the sentence, bow your head to the storm. It then assumes the majesty\r\nof \"my\" before it; is generally more than simple objurgation--it prefaces\r\na sermon. My candor obliges me to confess that this is the mode in which\r\nthe hateful monosyllable is more usually employed by the marital part of\r\nthe one flesh; and has something about it of the odious assumption of the\r\nPetruchian _pater familias_--the head of the family--boding, not perhaps\r\n\"peace, and love, and quiet life,\" but certainly \"awful rule and right\r\nsupremacy.\" _Ex. gr._\r\n\r\n\"My dear Jane--I wish you would just put by that everlasting tent-stitch,\r\nand listen to me for a few moments,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Jane--I wish you would understand me for once--don't think I am\r\nangry-no, but I am hurt. You must consider,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Jane--I don't know if it is your intention to ruin me; but I\r\nonly wish you would do as all other women do who care three straws for\r\ntheir husbands' property,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Jane--I wish you to understand that I am the last person in the\r\nworld to be jealous; but I'll be d----d if that puppy, Capt. Prettyman,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nNow, if that same \"dear\" could be thoroughly raked and hoed out of the\r\nconnubial garden, I don't think that the remaining nettles would signify\r\na button. But even as it was, Parson Dale, good man, would have prized\r\nhis garden beyond all the bowers which Spenser and Tasso have sung so\r\nmusically, though there had not been a single specimen of \"dear,\" whether\r\nthe dear _humilis_, or the dear _superba_; the dear _pallida, rubra_, or\r\n_nigra_; the dear _umbrosa, florens, spicata_; the dear _savis_, or the\r\ndear _horrida_;--no, not a single dear in the whole horticulture of\r\nmatrimony which Mrs. Dale had not brought to perfection. But this,\r\nfortunately, was far from being the case--the _dears_ of Mrs. Dale were\r\nonly wild flowers after all!\r\n\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cool of the evening Dr. Riccabocca walked home across the fields.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Dale had accompanied him half way; and as they now turned\r\nback to the parsonage, they looked behind, to catch a glimpse of the\r\ntall, outlandish figure, winding slowly through the path amidst the waves\r\nof the green corn.\r\n\r\n\"Poor man!\" said Mrs. Dale, feelingly; \"and the button was off his\r\nwristband! What a pity he has nobody to take care of him! He seems very\r\ndomestic. Don't you think, Charles, it would be a great blessing if we\r\ncould get him a good wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" said the Parson; \"I doubt if he values the married state as he\r\nought.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Charles? I never saw a man more polite to ladies in my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what? You are always so mysterious, Charles dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mysterious! No, Carry; but if you could hear what the Doctor says of the\r\nladies sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, when you men get together, my dear, I know what that means-pretty\r\nthings you say of us. But you are all alike; you know you are, love!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" said the Parson, simply, \"that I have good cause to speak\r\nwell of the sex--when I think of you, and my poor mother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, who, with all her \"tempers,\" was an excellent woman, and loved\r\nher husband with the whole of her quick little heart, was touched. She\r\npressed his hand, and did not call him _dear_ all the way home.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Italian passed the fields, and came upon the high-road\r\nabout two miles from Hazeldean. On one side stood an old-fashioned\r\nsolitary inn, such as English inns used to be before they became railway\r\nhotels--square, solid, old-fashioned, looking so hospitable and\r\ncomfortable, with their great signs swinging from some elm tree in front,\r\nand the long row of stables standing a little back, with a chaise or two\r\nin the yard, and the jolly landlord talking of the crops to some stout\r\nfarmer, who has stopped his rough pony at the well-known door. Opposite\r\nthis inn, on the other side the road, stood the habitation of Dr.\r\nRiccabocca.\r\n\r\nA few years before the date of these annals, the stage coach, on its way\r\nto London from a seaport town, stopped at the inn, as was its wont, for a\r\ngood hour, that its passengers might dine like Christian Englishmen--not\r\ngulp down a basin of scalding soup, like everlasting heathen Yankees,\r\nwith that cursed railway whistle shrieking like a fiend in their ears! It\r\nwas the best dining-place on the whole road, for the trout in the\r\nneighboring rill were famous, and so was the mutton which came from\r\nHazeldean Park.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside of the coach had descended two passengers who, alone\r\ninsensible to the attractions of mutton and trout, refused to dine--two\r\nmelancholy-looking foreigners, of whom one was Signor Riccabocca, much\r\nthe same as we see him now, only that the black suit was less threadbare,\r\nthe tall form less meager, and he did not then wear spectacles; and the\r\nother was his servant. \"They would walk about while the coach stopped.\"\r\nNow the Italian's eye had been caught by a mouldering dismantled house on\r\nthe other side of the road, which nevertheless was well situated;\r\nhalf-way up a green hill, with its aspect due south, a little cascade\r\nfalling down artificial rock-work, and a terrace with a balustrade, and a\r\nfew broken urns and statues before its Ionic portico; while on the\r\nroadside stood a board, with characters already half effaced, implying\r\nthat the house was to be \"Let unfurnished, with or without land.\"\r\n\r\nThe abode that looked so cheerless, and which had so evidently hung long\r\non hand, was the property of Squire Hazeldean. It had been built by his\r\ngrandfather on the female side--a country gentleman who had actually been\r\nin Italy (a journey rare enough to boast of in those days), and who, on\r\nhis return home, had attempted a miniature imitation of an Italian villa.\r\nHe left an only daughter and sole heiress, who married Squire Hazeldean's\r\nfather: and since that time, the house, abandoned by its proprietors for\r\nthe larger residence of the Hazeldeans, had been uninhabited and\r\nneglected. Several tenants, indeed, had offered themselves; but your\r\nsquire is slow in admitting upon his own property a rival neighbor. Some\r\nwanted shooting. \"That,\" said the Hazeldeans, who were great sportsmen\r\nand strict preservers, \"was quite out of the question.\" Others were fine\r\nfolks from London. \"London servants,\" said the Hazeldeans, who were moral\r\nand prudent people, \"would corrupt their own, and bring London prices.\"\r\nOthers, again, were retired manufacturers, at whom the Hazeldeans turned\r\nup their agricultural noses. In short, some were too grand, and others\r\ntoo vulgar. Some were refused because they were known so well: \"Friends\r\nare best at a distance,\" said the Hazeldeans. Others because they were\r\nnot known at all: \"No good comes of strangers,\" said the Hazeldeans. And\r\nfinally, as the house fell more and more into decay, no one would take it\r\nunless it was put into thorough repair: \"As if one was made of money!\"\r\nsaid the Hazeldeans. In short, there stood the house unoccupied and\r\nruinous; and there, on its terrace, stood the two forlorn Italians,\r\nsurveying it with a smile at each other, as, for the first time since\r\nthey set foot in England, they recognized, in dilapidated pilasters and\r\nbroken statues, in a weed-grown terrace and the remains of an orangery,\r\nsomething that reminded them of the land they had left behind.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the inn, Dr. Riccabocca took the occasion of learning\r\nfrom the innkeeper (who was indeed a tenant of the Squire's) such\r\nparticulars as he could collect; and a few days afterward Mr. Hazeldean\r\nreceived a letter from a solicitor of repute in London, stating that a\r\nvery respectable foreign gentleman had commissioned him to treat for\r\nClump Lodge, otherwise called the \"Casino;\" that the said gentleman did\r\nnot shoot--lived in great seclusion--and, having no family, did not care\r\nabout the repairs of the place, provided only it were made\r\nweather-proof--if the omission of more expensive reparations could render\r\nthe rent suitable to his finances, which were very limited. The offer\r\ncame at a fortunate moment--when the steward had just been representing\r\nto the Squire the necessity of doing something to keep the Casino from\r\nfalling into positive ruin, and the Squire was cursing the fates which\r\nhad put the Casino into an entail--so that he could not pull it down for\r\nthe building materials. Mr. Hazeldean therefore, caught at the proposal\r\neven as a fair lady, who has refused the best offers in the kingdom,\r\ncatches at last at some battered old Captain on half-pay, and replied\r\nthat, as for rent, if the solicitors client was a quiet respectable man,\r\nhe did not care for that. But that the gentleman might have it for the\r\nfirst year rent free, on condition of paying the taxes and putting the\r\nplace a little in order. If they suited each other, they could then come\r\nto terms. Ten days subsequently to this gracious reply, Signer Riccabocca\r\nand his servant arrived; and, before the years end, the Squire was so\r\ncontented with his tenant that he gave him a running lease of seven,\r\nfourteen, or twenty-one years, at a rent nearly nominal, on condition\r\nthat Signer Riccabocca would put and maintain the place in repair,\r\nbarring the roof and fences, which the Squire generously renewed at his\r\nown expense. It was astonishing, by little and little, what a pretty\r\nplace the Italian had made of it, and what is more astonishing, how\r\nlittle it had cost him. He had indeed painted the walls of the hall,\r\nstaircase, and the rooms appropriated to himself, with his own hands. His\r\nservant had done the greater part of the upholstery. The two between them\r\nhad got the garden into order. The Italians seemed to have taken a joint\r\nlove to the place, and to deck it as they would have done some favorite\r\nchapel to their Madonna.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the natives reconciled themselves to the odd ways of\r\nthe foreign settlers. The first thing that offended them was the\r\nexceeding smallness of the household bills. Three days out of the seven,\r\nindeed, both man and master dined on nothing else but the vegetables in\r\nthe garden, and the fishes in the neighboring rill; when no trout could\r\nbe caught they fried the minnows, (and certainly, even in the best\r\nstreams, minnows are more frequently caught than trouts.) The next thing\r\nwhich angered the natives quite as much, especially the female part of\r\nthe neighborhood, was the very sparing employment the two he creatures\r\ngave to the sex usually deemed so indispensable in household matters. At\r\nfirst indeed, they had no woman servant at all. But this created such\r\nhorror that Parson Dale ventured a hint upon the matter, which Riccabocca\r\ntook in very good part, and an old woman was forthwith engaged, after\r\nsome bargaining--at three shillings a week--to wash and scrub as much as\r\nshe liked during the daytime. She always returned to her own cottage to\r\nsleep. The man servant, who was styled in the neighborhood \"Jackeymo,\"\r\ndid all else for his master--smoothed his room, dusted his papers,\r\nprepared his coffee, cooked his dinner, brushed his clothes, and cleaned\r\nhis pipes, of which Riccabocca had a large collection. But however close\r\na man's character, it generally creeps out in driblets; and on many\r\nlittle occasions the Italian had shown acts of kindness, and, on some\r\nmore rare occasions, even of generosity, which had served to silence his\r\ncalumniators, and by degrees he had established a very fair\r\nreputation--suspected, it is true, of being a little inclined to the\r\nBlack Art, and of a strange inclination to starve Jackeymo and\r\nhimself,--in other respects harmless enough.\r\n\r\nSignor Riccabocca had become very intimate, as we have seen, at the\r\nParsonage. But not so at the Hall. For though the Squire was inclined to\r\nbe very friendly to all his neighbors--he was, like most country\r\ngentlemen, rather easily _huffed_. Riccabocca had, if with great\r\npoliteness, still with great obstinacy, refused Mr. Hazeldean's earlier\r\ninvitations to dinner; and when the Squire found that the Italian rarely\r\ndeclined to dine at the Parsonage, he was offended in one of his weak\r\npoints--viz., his regard for the honor of the hospitality of Hazeldean\r\nHall--and he ceased altogether invitations so churlishly rejected.\r\nNevertheless, as it was impossible for the Squire, however huffed, to\r\nbear malice, he now and then reminded Riccabocca of his existence by\r\npresents of game, and would have called on him more often than he did,\r\nbut that Riccabocca received him with such excessive politeness that the\r\nblunt country gentleman felt shy and put out, and used to say, that \"to\r\ncall on Riccabocca was as bad as going to court.\"\r\n\r\nBut I left Dr. Riccabocca on the high-road. By this time he has ascended\r\na narrow path that winds by the side of the cascade, he has passed a\r\ntrellis-work covered with vines, from the which Jacheymo has positively\r\nsucceeded in making what he calls _wine_--a liquid, indeed, that, if the\r\ncholera had been popularly known in those days, would have soured the\r\nmildest member of the Board of Health; for Squire Hazeldean, though a\r\nrobust man, who daily carried off his bottle of port with impunity,\r\nhaving once rashly tasted it, did not recover the effect till he had had\r\na bill from the apothecary as long as his own arm. Passing this trellis,\r\nDr. Riccabocca entered upon the terrace, with its stone pavement smoothed\r\nand trim as hands could make it. Here, on neat stands, all his favorite\r\nflowers were arranged.  Here four orange-trees were in full blossom; here\r\na kind of summer-house or Belvidere, built by Jackeymo and himself, made\r\nhis chosen morning-room from May till October; and from this Belvidere\r\nthere was as beautiful an expanse of prospect as if our English Nature\r\nhad hospitably spread on her green board all that she had to offer as a\r\nbanquet to the exile.\r\n\r\nA man without his coat, which was thrown over the balustrade, was\r\nemployed in watering the flowers: a man with movements so\r\nmechanical--with a face so rigidly grave in its tawny hues--that he\r\nseemed like an automaton made out of mahogany.\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo,\" said Dr. Riccabocca, softly.\r\n\r\nThe automaton stopped its hand, and turned its head.\r\n\r\n\"Put by the watering-pot, and come here,\" continued Riccabocca in\r\nItalian; and moving toward the balustrade, he leaned over it. Mr.\r\nMitford, the historian, calls Jean Jacques _John James_. Following that\r\nillustrious example, Giacomo shall be Anglified into Jackeymo.\r\nJackeymo came to the balustrade also, and stood a little behind his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\"Friend,\" said Riccabocca, \"enterprises have not always succeeded with\r\nus. Don't you think, after all, it is tempting our evil star to rent\r\nthose fields from the landlord?\" Jackeymo crossed himself, and made some\r\nstrange movement with a little coral charm which he wore set in a ring on\r\nhis finger.\r\n\r\n\"If the Madonna send us luck, and we could hire a lad cheap?\" said\r\nJackeymo, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"_Piu vale un presente che due futuri_,\" said Riccabocca--\"A bird in the\r\nhand is worth two in the bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Chi non fa quondo può, non può fare quondo vuole_\"--(\"He who will not\r\nwhen he may, when he will it shall have nay\")--answered Jackeymo, as\r\nsententiously as his master. \"And the Padrone should think in time that\r\nhe must lay by for the dower of the poor signorina\"--(young lady.)\r\n\r\nRiccabocca sighed, and made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"She must be _that_ high now!\" said Jackeymo, putting his band on some\r\nimaginary line a little above the balustrade. Riccabocca's eyes, raised\r\nover the spectacles, followed the hand.\r\n\r\n\"If the Padrone could but see her here\"--\r\n\r\n\"I thought I did!\" muttered the Italian.\r\n\r\n\"He would never let her go from his side till she went to a husband's,\"\r\ncontinued Jackeymo.\r\n\r\n\"But this climate--she could never stand it,\" said Riccabocca, drawing\r\nhis cloak round him, as a north wind took him in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"The orange-trees blossom even here with care,\" said Jackeymo, turning\r\nback to draw down an awning where the orange-trees faced the north.\r\n\"See!\" he added, as he returned with a sprig in fall bud.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca bent over the blossom, and then placed it in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"The _other_ one should be there too.\" said Jackeymo.\r\n\r\n\"To die--as this does already!\" answered Riccabocca. \"Say no more.\"\r\n\r\nJackeymo shrugged his shoulders; and then, glancing at his master, threw\r\nhis hand over his eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Jackeymo was the first to break it.\r\n\r\n\"But, whether here or there, beauty without  money is the orange-tree\r\nwithout shelter. If a lad could be got cheap, I would hire the land, and\r\ntrust for the crop to the Madonna.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know of such a lad,\" said Riccabocca, recovering himself, and\r\nwith his sardonic smile once more lurking about the corner of his\r\nmouth--\"a lad made for us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Diavolo!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not the Diavolo! Friend, I have this day seen a boy who-refused\r\nsixpence!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cosa stupenda_!\"--(Stupendous thing!) exclaimed Jackeymo, opening his\r\neyes, and letting fall the watering-pot.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take him, Padrone, in Heaven's name, and the fields will grow gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will think of it, for it must require management to catch such a boy,\"\r\nsaid Riccabocca. \"Meanwhile, light a candle in the parlor, and bring from\r\nmy bedroom--that great folio of Machiavelli.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRECENT DEATHS.\r\n\r\nLOUIS PHILIPPE, EX-KING OF THE FRENCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes of kings form an impressive chapter in the history of\r\nEurope; and one of the most striking episodes in the narrative is the\r\ncheckered life of the last king of France--one week among the mightiest\r\nmonarchs on the loftiest pinnacle of ambition, he was, the next, an exile\r\nin a foreign land--his past supremacy almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe died on the morning of the 26th of August, at Claremont,\r\nin the presence of the Queen and several members of his family. He had\r\nbeen made aware of his approaching dissolution early the previous day,\r\nand receiving with calmness the melancholy intimation, prepared for the\r\nfinal arrangements he wished to make. After a conversion with the Queen,\r\nhe dictated, with remarkable clearness, the concluding portion of his\r\nMemoirs, and then, having caused to be assembled his chaplain, the Abbé\r\nGaelle, and all his children and grandchildren who were at Claremont, he\r\nreceived, with resignation and firmness, the last rites of the Catholic\r\nChurch. Toward seven in the evening the debility that had oppressed him\r\nappeared to pass off, and fever came on, which continued during the night\r\nwith much violence, but without disturbing his composure of mind.\r\nAt eight o'clock in the morning he expired, in the presence of his wife,\r\nand of the Duchess of Orleans, the Count of Paris, the Duke de Chartres,\r\nthe Duke and Duchess de Nemours, the Prince and Princess de Joinville,\r\nthe Duke and Duchess d'Aureale, and the Duchess Augusta of Saxe-Coburg.\r\nThus ended the closing scene of the life of Louis Philippe of\r\nOrleans,--the wise and judicious sovereign of a great people, the soldier\r\nof one revolution, the conqueror of a second, and the victim of a third.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe was born in Paris, 6th October, 1773, the eldest son of\r\nPhilippe Joseph, Duke of Orleans (so well-known under the revolutionary\r\n_soubriquet_ of Egalité), by Marie Louise Adelaide de Bourbon his wife,\r\ndaughter and heir of the wealthy Duke de Penthievre. At his birth he bore\r\nthe title of Valois; but after the death of his grandfather, in 1785, was\r\nstyled Duke of Chartres. The care of the young Prince's education was\r\nassigned to Madame de Genlis, who ably and admirably performed her\r\nimportant duties. From her guidance Louis Philippe passed at once to the\r\narena of active life. In 1791, the Prince, then Duke of Chartres, having\r\npreviously received the appointment of Colonel in the 14th Dragoons,\r\nassumed the command of that regiment, and shortly after, quitting the\r\ngarrison of Vendôme, proceeded to Valenciennes, where he continued to\r\npursue his military avocations. In the April of the following year, war\r\nbeing declared against Austria, the Duke made his first campaign,\r\nfighting with gallantry under Kellerman at Valmy, and with Dumouriez at\r\nJemappes. But the horrors of the Revolution were progressing with giant\r\nstrides; the unfortunate Louis XVI. was carried to the scaffold, and\r\nwithin a few months after, the Duke of Orleans was seized on a plea of\r\nconspiracy against the French nation, and after a mock trial, consigned\r\nto the executioner. A short time previously to the death of his father,\r\nthe Duke de Chartres had effected his escape through Belgium into\r\nSwitzerland, and there was joined by his sister Adelaide and Madame de\r\nGenlis. Our confined space precludes the possibility of our dwelling on\r\nthe romantic events of this period of Louis Philippe's life, and permits\r\nus to glance only at his wanderings through Switzerland, Denmark,\r\nLapland, Finland, America, and England. For one year he held the\r\nAppointment of Professor in the College of Reichenau, at a salary of\r\nfifty-eight pounds; and for that sum undertook to teach history,\r\nmathematics, and English. He bore the name of Chabaud-Latour, and none\r\nbut the superiors of the institution were aware of his rank. The news of\r\nhis father's execution reached him while quietly instructing the youth of\r\nReichenau, and he instantly threw up his Professorship, and after a\r\nprotracted journey through northern Europe, succeeded, by the kind\r\ninstrumentality of Mr. Gouverneur Morris, the American Ambassador at\r\nParis, in reaching the United States. He landed at Philadelphia on the\r\n24th October, 1796, and was soon after joined by his brothers,\r\nMontpensier and Beaujolais. The three brothers passed the winter in that\r\ncity, and afterward made a journey through the Western States, and\r\nvisited General Washington at Mount Vernon. Their residence in this\r\ncountry was not however of very long duration. After an inhospitable\r\nreception by the Spanish authorities in Cuba, the royal exiles made their\r\nway to England, in February, 1800, and thence immediately proceeded to\r\nBarcelona, in the hope of meeting their mother. But this object failing,\r\nthey returned to England, and took up their abode at Twickenham, on the\r\nbanks of the Thames. In Great Britain they were treated with respect and\r\nconsideration, and were furnished with ample opportunities for repose\r\nafter their exciting adventures. Within a few years, however, the Duke of\r\nMontpensier and the Count Beaujolais both died--the former in England,\r\nthe latter at Malta. Louis Philippe had accompanied his last surviving\r\nbrother to that island, and after his interment sailed for Sicily, on the\r\ninvitation of the King of Naples. There he gained the affections of the\r\nPrincess Amelia, and their marriage took place in November, 1809. No\r\nevent of material importance marks the subsequent life of the Duke, until\r\nthe year 1814, when, on the abdication of Napoleon, he returned to Paris,\r\nand for a short period was in full enjoyment of his honors. In 1815,\r\nNapoleon's escape from Elba again called the Duke of Orleans into active\r\nemployment, and he proceeded, in obedience to the desire of Louis XVIII.,\r\nto take the command of the Army of the North. In this situation he\r\nremained until the 24th of March, hen he surrendered his command to the\r\nDuke de Treviso, and retired to Twickenham. After the Hundred Days, the\r\nDuke of Orleans obeyed the ordinance authorizing the Princes of the blood\r\nto take their seats in the Chamber of Peers; but subsequently incurring\r\nthe jealousy and displeasure of the Court, he resought his old residence\r\non the Thames, and dwelt there in seclusion until 1817, when he went back\r\nto France, and devoted himself to the education of his children, until\r\nthe Revolution of 1830 broke out, resulting in his elevation to the\r\nthrone. The subsequent events of his reign, and the memorable outbreak\r\nof 1848, that finally overthrew the dynasty that the monarch had strained\r\nevery nerve to establish, are too fresh on the public mind to require\r\nrecapitulation here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN INMAN.\r\n\r\nJohn Inman, a son of William Inman, was born in Utica in 1805. He had two\r\nbrothers, William, a commander in the Navy, and Henry, so well known as\r\none of the finest artists of this country. John Inman was educated pretty\r\nmuch by chance; he had the usual country schooling; but whatever valuable\r\ncultivation he had was in after-life when he was alone in the world,\r\nseeking his fortune. In 1823 he went to North Carolina where he taught\r\nschool for two years. In the spring of 1826, with the profits of his\r\nschoolmastership, he went to Europe, and traveled there a little more\r\nthan a year. On his return, being admitted to the bar, he practiced law\r\nabout two years, when, in 1829, he became one of the editors of _The\r\nStandard_ newspaper, which he left in 1830 to conduct the _Mirror_. In\r\n1833 he was married to Miss Fisher, a sister of the popular and estimable\r\nactress, Clara Fisher, and about this time he devoted the leisure left\r\nfrom the duties of the Mirror office to a paper owned by his\r\nbrother-in-law and himself, called _The Spirit of the Times_. In 1833 he\r\naccepted an offer from the late Colonel Stone to become one of the\r\neditors of the _Commercial Advertiser_, of which he became the editor in\r\nchief upon the death of that gentleman, in 1844. He continued in this\r\npost until his failing health last spring compelled him entirely to\r\nrelinquish the use of the pen; and gradually declining, he died on the\r\n30th of August.\r\n\r\nMr. Inman had edited several books, and for two or three years he\r\nconducted the _Columbian Magazine_. He was for a long time the critical\r\nreader of the great house of Harper & Brothers, who learned by a happy\r\nexperience to confide unhesitatingly in his judgment of books. He wrote\r\nmany tales and sketches for the annuals and other publications, and a\r\nfew poems, of which \"Byron, a Fragment,\" was the longest. Of the\r\n_Columbian Magazine_, he wrote with his own hand the _whole_ of one\r\nnumber, partly from an ambition to achieve what seemed an impossible\r\nfeat, and partly from his habit of close and unremitting labor. He also\r\nwrote several literary papers for the _New York Review_.\r\nHe was a gentleman of the most honorable nature, and of the finest taste\r\nand most refined habits.  Perhaps there was not connected with the press\r\nin this city a writer of purer English, and very few of our literary men\r\nhave had a more thorough knowledge of French and English literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADONIRAM JUDSON, D.D.\r\n\r\nThe death of this widely-known and eminently devoted missionary is\r\nannounced in an article of _The Tribune_, to have taken place on the 12th\r\nof April, on board of the French brig Ariotide, bound to the Isle of\r\nBourbon, in which he had taken passage for the benefit of his health. His\r\nremains were committed to the deep on the evening of his death. For some\r\ntime past the health of Dr. Judson, which had been seriously impaired for\r\nseveral years, has been known to be in an alarming state, and the news of\r\nhis decease accordingly will not come as an unlooked-for blow upon his\r\nwide circle of friends. Dr. Judson was the son of Rev. Adoniram Judson, a\r\nCongregational clergyman in Plymouth county, Mass. He received his\r\ncollegiate education at Brown University, with the original intention of\r\npursuing the profession of the law, but experiencing a great change in\r\nhis religious views soon after his graduation, he entered the Theological\r\nSeminary at Andover. During his residence at this institution, a profound\r\ninterest in Foreign Missions was awakened among the students which\r\nresulted in his determination to devote his life to the missionary\r\nservice. Leaving his native land, among the first missionaries sent forth\r\nby the American Board, in company with Samuel Nevill, Luther Rice, and\r\nSamuel Nott, he arrived in Calcutta, in 1812. In consequence of studies\r\nduring the voyage, he was led to change his opinions on the subject of\r\nbaptism, and a short time after his landing, received the rite of\r\nimmersion from the hands of one of the English missionaries resident in\r\nCalcutta. His sermon on that occasion, which produced a deep impression\r\non the religious world, is a masterpiece of logical argument, Scriptural\r\nresearch and grave eloquence. After connecting himself with the Baptist\r\ndenomination, he selected the Burman empire as the seat of his future\r\nlabors--at which post he has remained, with scarcely an interval of\r\nrelaxation, for nearly forty years. His efforts and sufferings in the\r\nprosecution of his mission are well known. He was a man of high and\r\nresolute courage, of remarkable self-reliance, of more than common mental\r\nability and of devotion to the performance of his duty, almost without a\r\nparallel in modern times. He had all the elements of a hero in his\r\ncomposition, and whoever would look for a rare specimen of a life\r\nconsecrated to noble, ideal aims, inspired with an elevated and almost\r\nromantic self-devotion, and daily exercising a valiant energy more\r\ndifficult of attainment than that which animates the soldier amid the\r\nsmoke of battle, must contemplate the strange and beautiful history of\r\nthe lion-hearted missionary of Burmah.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRY WHITE, D.D.\r\n\r\nThe REV. HENRY WHITE, D.D., Professor of Theology in the Union\r\nTheological Seminary, died in this city on Sunday, August 25th, in\r\nthe fifty-first year of his age. We obtain the following biographical\r\nfacts from _The Independent:_ \"Professor White was born in Durham,\r\nGreene county, in this state. He had nearly reached the age of manhood\r\nbefore commencing a liberal course of education; was graduated at Union\r\nCollege in 1824; studied theology at Princeton, N.J., and after being\r\nlicensed to preach the Gospel, was employed as an agent of the American\r\nBible Society in Georgia and the Carolinas. In this service he remained\r\nduring parts of the years 1826 and 1827. In 1827-28 he was engaged as an\r\nagent of the same society in New York and the vicinity; and during that\r\nperiod he supplied for some time the pulpit of the second Presbyterian\r\nchurch in Newark, N.J. In March, 1829, he became pastor of the\r\nAllen-street Presbyterian church in this city, in which office he\r\nremained until after his appointment to the Professorship of Theology in\r\nthe Union Theological Seminary, then newly formed in this city. He was\r\ndismissed from his pastoral charge in March, 1837. The labors of his\r\nprofessorship were begun and carried on for some years in discouragement.\r\nThe pecuniary basis on which the Seminary rested was inadequate, and\r\nthere were arrearages in the salaries. In 1843 Professor W. was invited\r\nto Auburn, and great anxiety was felt lest he should accept the\r\ninvitation. But his own attachment to the Seminary and the entreaties of\r\nhis friends, and an effort which was made to endow his Professorship with\r\na sufficient permanent fund, induced him to remain, and he held the\r\noffice as long as he lived.\"\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR MARTIN ARCHER SHEE, P.R.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR MARTIN ARCHER SHEE, long known in art and letters, and for some years\r\nthe oldest member as well as the President of the Royal Society, died at\r\nBrighton, on the 13th of August, in the eighty-first year of his age. He\r\nwas descended lineally from one of the Kings of Munster, in the third\r\ncentury, and his family in more recent times has been honorably\r\ndistinguished. He was born in Dublin, on the 23d of December, 1770. He\r\nevinced extraordinary precocity in his art, and when but twelve years old\r\nobtained of the Irish Academy medals for figures, landscapes and flowers.\r\nThe author of \"Wine and Walnuts,\" as quoted in the London _Athenaeum_,\r\ngives the following account of his first appearance in the Great\r\nMetropolis:\r\n\r\n\"I well remember this gentleman on his first arrival from Ireland to the\r\nBritish metropolis; he was introduced to the notice of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, and to some other distinguished persons by his illustrious\r\nFriend and countryman Mr. Edmund Burke. I was at that time making a\r\ndrawing in the Plaster Academy in Somerset House, and perfectly recollect\r\nthe first evening Mr. Shee joining the students there. He selected the\r\nfigure of the Discobolus for his probationary exercises to procure a\r\npermanent student's ticket. I need not say that he obtained it,--for it\r\nwas acknowledged to be one of the best copies that had yet been seen of\r\nthat fine figure. I further remarked that Mr. Wilton, the then keeper of\r\nthe Royal Academy, was so pleased with the performance that he expressed\r\na wish to retain it, after Mr. Shee had received his ticket; and Mr.\r\nShee, with that politeness which marked his early career, presented it\r\nto the worthy old gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shee became an exhibitor at the Royal Academy for the first time in\r\n1789. He abstained from exhibiting in the following year, wisely\r\nhusbanding his strength--worked hard at his art--gave his nights and days\r\nto Sir Joshua; and in 1791 took handsome apartments, and sent four\r\nportraits to the Exhibition. In 1792 he removed to yet better rooms, and\r\nsent in all seven works to the Exhibition. In the same year he walked as\r\none of the students of the Royal Academy at the funeral of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds. In 1793 he reached what is now the full Academical number of\r\neight portraits. The Exhibition of the following year contained his as\r\nyet most ambitious efforts:--a portrait of a young lady as Miranda in\r\n\"The Tempest,\" and \"Jephtha's Daughter\" from the Book of Judges. In 1795\r\nhe exhibited a portrait of himself,--and a portrait of Mr. Addington,\r\nafterward Lord Sidmouth. In 1797 he exhibited in all ten works; including\r\nportraits of Pope and Fawcett the actors. He continued equally\r\nindustrious for many successive years; and was in such favor with his\r\nfellow artists that he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in\r\n1798, immediately after the election of Flaxman into the same honorary\r\nrank. The same year, on Romney's withdrawal from London, he removed to\r\nthe house which that artist had built for himself in Cavendish Square;\r\nand in this he continued as Romney's successor to reside until age and\r\ngrowing infirmities compelled him to withdraw to Brighton, and abandon\r\nhis pencil. In 1800, he was elected a full Royal Academician:--and of his\r\nthirty-nine brethren by whom he was chosen he was the last survivor.\r\n\r\nMr. Shee continued to produce for years with amazing readiness of hand\r\nand fertility in posture. People of all ranks in life went to Cavendish\r\nSquare, and for a time Shee was in greater request than either Beechey\r\nor Hoppner, though not so much so as Lawrence, or even as Owen or\r\nPhillips somewhat later. Lord Spencer was the first nobleman who sat to\r\nhim; and his example was followed by the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of\r\nLeinster, the Marquis of Exeter, and others. The ladies flocked less\r\nreadily around him; for Lawrence had then, as he continued to have, the\r\nentire artist monopoly of the beauty of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMuch to the surprise of his friends, and to the infinite wonder of some\r\nof his brethren in the Academy, Mr. Shee made his appearance as a poet by\r\nthe publication, in 1805, of his \"Rhymes on Art, or the Remonstrance of a\r\nPainter; in two parts, with Notes and a Preface, including Strictures on\r\nthe State of the Arts, Criticism, Patronage, and Public Taste\": and the\r\nwonder had not ceased with Nollekins and Northcote, when, in 1809, he\r\npublished a second poem, in six cantos, entitled \"Elements of Art.\" It is\r\nto these poems that Byron alludes in his \"English Bards and Scotch\r\nReviewers\":\r\n\r\n  \"And here let Shee and Genius find a place,\r\n  Whose pen and pencil yield an equal grace;\r\n  To guide whose hand the sister-arts combine,\r\n  And trace the poet's or painter's line;\r\n  Whose magic touch can bid the canvas glow,\r\n  Or pour the easy rhyme's harmonious flow;\r\n  While honors, doubly merited, attend\r\n  The poet's rival, but the painter's friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Quarterly_ was complimentary, but less kind to the painter than the\r\nnoble lord.\r\n\r\nMr. Shee appears to have always evinced taste for the theater; and when\r\nhis gravity of years and his position as a popular portrait-painter\r\nforbade his any longer entertaining a wish to appear there, he began to\r\nwoo the dramatic Muse, and commenced a tragedy called \"Alasco,\" of which\r\nthe scene was laid in Poland. The play was accepted at Covent Garden, but\r\nexcluded, it was said, from the stage by Colman, who was then licenser.\r\nThis is not strictly true. Colman objected to about eighty-five lines,\r\nwhich Shee refused to alter. Colman was equally obstinate; and Shee in\r\n1824 printed his play, and appealed to the public against the licenser in\r\na lengthy and angry preface. \"Alasco,\" notwithstanding, is still on the\r\nlist of the unacted drama.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Lawrence in 1830, Shee was elected President of the Royal\r\nAcademy, and immediately knighted. His election was by a large majority,\r\nthough Wilkie was a candidate; the members being governed in their votes\r\nrather, it is said, by the necessities of their annual dinner than by\r\ntheir sense of the merits of Shee as a painter. He excelled in short,\r\nwell-timed and well-delivered speeches. He was seldom at a loss; and so\r\nhighly was his eloquence appreciated within the walls of the Academy,\r\nthat it had been common with more than one Royal Academician to remark\r\nwhenever a great speaker was mentioned--\"Did you ever hear the\r\nPresident--you should hear the President,\"--as if Canning and Stanley had\r\nbeen united in Sir Martin Archer Shee.\r\n\r\nHe has but little claim to be remembered as a poet. His verse wants\r\nvigor, and his examples are deficient in novelty of illustration. The\r\nnotes to both his poems are, however, valuable, and his poetry is perhaps\r\nmore frequently read for its prose illustrations than for the beauty of\r\nits versification or the value of the truths which it seeks to inculcate.\r\nAs a portrait-painter he was eclipsed by several or his\r\ncontemporaries,--by Lawrence and by Hoppner,--by Phillips, Jackson, and\r\nRaeburn. He had a fine eye for color; while his leading want was,\r\nproportion, more especially in his heads. Compare his head of Chantrey\r\nwith the portraits of Chantrey by Jackson and Raeburn, and the defect is\r\nat once obvious; or compare his head of Mr. Hallam with the head of Mr.\r\nHallam by Phillips, or with the living head--since happily Mr. Hallam is\r\nstill among us. How, then, it will be asked, is Sir Martin to be\r\nremembered: by his poems or by his portraits?--by his speeches or by his\r\nannual addresses to the students? The question is not difficult of\r\nsolution. His pictures in the Vernon Gallery will not preserve his name,\r\nnor will his portraits viewed as works of Art. His name will scend in the\r\nHistory of Painting as a clever artist with greater accomplishments than\r\nhave commonly fallen to the class to which he belongs,--and as the\r\npainter who has preserved to us the faces and figures of Sir Thomas\r\nMunro, Sir Thomas Picton, Sir Eyre Coote, Sir James Scarlett, and Sir\r\nHenry Halford. There was merit, we may add, in his portrait of the poet\r\nMoore. Principally, however, he will be remembered as one of the\r\nPresidents of the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGERARD TROOST, M.D.\r\n\r\nDr. GERARD TROOST, for a long period one of the most eminent naturalists\r\nof the United States, died on the 14th of August at Nashville, where he\r\nhad been for twenty years Professor of Chemistry and Natural History in\r\nthe University of Tennessee. A native of Holland, and educated in one of\r\nher universities, he devoted himself to the natural sciences. For the\r\nsake of improvement he visited Paris, and for several years was a pupil\r\nof the celebrated Hauy. He removed to the United States about forty years\r\nago, and in due time became an American citizen. In 1824 and 1825 he was\r\nwith Robert Owen at New Harmony, and he appears always to have been\r\ndistinguished for eccentricities of opinion and conduct, but to have\r\ncommanded in every situation respect and affection. His entire life was\r\nconsecrated to geology and the kindred sciences, with what ability and\r\nsuccess, his published writings and his well-earned reputation at home\r\nand abroad may eloquently testify. Among the subjects upon which he wrote\r\nare, amber of Cape Sable, Maryland; the minerals of Missouri; five\r\nreports on the geology of Tennessee; meteoric iron from Tennessee and\r\nAlabama; a shower of red matter in Tennessee; meteorites, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCEVAL W. BANKS.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman--better known as _Morgan Rattler_ of \"Fraser's\r\nMagazine\"--died in London on the 13th of August. Mr. Banks, though only\r\nin his forty-fifth year, was the last of the race of writers, who, with\r\nDr. Maginn, Mr. Churchill, and others, gave a sting and pungency (of a\r\nvicious and unwholesome kind however), to the early numbers of that\r\njournal. He seldom did justice to his own talents, for he wrote too often\r\nin haste, always at the last moment, and too rarely with good taste. He\r\nwas by profession a barrister. The world at large, who admired the\r\nsportive fancy, classical eloquence, and kind yet firm criticism of poor\r\n_Morgan Rattler_, in his later years, will regret the early decease of\r\none so gifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT HUNT.\r\n\r\nMr. ROBERT HUNT, the eldest brother of Mr. Leigh Hunt, often mentioned in\r\nthe \"Autobiography,\" is dead.

Our own specimens of the class are commonplace artists\r\ncompared with their American brethren. The season is at hand when we are\r\nlooking out for the performances at the former,--but we expect little\r\nfrom beyond the old routine. In their sluggish imaginations, the annual\r\npike is doubtless already growing up to his great dimensions, which, on\r\nfailure of the accustomed springs of intelligence, we are soon to find\r\nfloating in the newspaper shallows,--and the preposterous cucumber is\r\nprobably having an inch added to its stature, which will shortly shoot\r\nrankly up where the parliamentary harvest has been cut down. The most\r\ndaring thing that we can expect from these geniuses is, a trick or two\r\nperhaps with the Nelson Column. But the American penny-a-liner, our\r\nreaders know, does the thing on the vast scale of his country. He takes\r\ndown Niagara at his pleasure,--and puts it up again in its place, or\r\nanywhere else that he will. He transports the great Falls about the soil\r\nof his country at halt a crown an adventure,--and for five shillings\r\nwould probably set them playing in the moon.\"\r\n\r\n        *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA \"MASONIC SWORD\" FOR THE EMPEROR OF HAYTI.--A magnificent sword,\r\nintended to be presented to the Emperor Soulouque on his installation to\r\nthe mysteries of the \"Grand Masonic Order of Hayti,\" has been made at\r\nBirmingham, thirty-two inches in length. The blade is richly ornamented\r\nalong its whole length with devices in blue and gold, bearing the\r\ninscription in French on the one side, \"To the illustrious F. Faustin\r\nSoulouque, Emperor of Hayti,\" and on the other, \"Homage of the Grand\r\nOrder of Hayti.\" The hilt is surmounted by an imperial crown, and adorned\r\nwith various masonic emblems. On the shield are richly chased the arms of\r\nHayti, with the motto, \"God! my Country, and my Sword,\" \"Liberty and\r\nIndependence.\" We perceive, also, from the French papers, that a\r\ncelebrated goldsmith at Paris, has forwarded to Hayti a crown, a scepter,\r\na wand of justice, and a sword of state, manufactured expressly for his\r\nsable Majesty, at a cost of £20,000 sterling. The latter has moreover,\r\ncommanded, for his coronation, a sky-blue velvet mantle, embroidered with\r\nbees and richly bound with gold lace, and a Court dress of scarlet\r\nvelvet, lined with white satin, and trimmed with the most expensive point\r\nlace, \"with most valuable ornaments to match.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTIME WORKS WONDERS.--A correspondent Of the _Melbourne Daily News_\r\nremarks that in June, 1847, he met Prince Louis Napoleon and his cousin\r\nJerome Napoleon at Lady Blessington's. \"The president was then living in\r\na very modest house in King-street, St. James's-square, and his very\r\nunaffected demeanor led me to form an intimate acquaintance with him. He\r\nappeared to me a person more fond of the ordinary amusements of the\r\nmetropolis, frequenting the theaters, casinos, and other similar places,\r\nthan an ambitious adventurer. On the following May as I was entering the\r\nchambers of my solicitor, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, an old gentleman with\r\nan umbrella under his arm passed me as I opened the swing doors, and\r\npolitely removed his hat as I made way for him. It was Louis Philippe. It\r\nis scarce three weeks ago I was ordering a waistcoat of my tailor, when\r\ntwo gentlemen entered the shop, and one of them in broken English gave an\r\norder for a paletot; I looked up, It was Ledru Rollin and Etienne Arago;\r\nwhen they had gone, the worthy tradesman, knowing I had lived much in\r\nParis, asked me if I knew his customer (M.

These mummies, male and female, both of American race, are\r\nnatural mummies,--that is to say, dried without embalming or any other\r\nspecies of preparation. The man is in a stooping posture, his head\r\nsustained on his hands, and his elbows renting on his knees. The face has\r\nan expression of pain which seems to indicate a, violent death. The woman\r\nis stretched at length, with arms crossed on her breast. Both heads are\r\ncovered with long hair, dark and silky, and divided into an infinity of\r\nsmall plaits. When Dr. Reid discovered these mummies both had their teeth\r\ncomplete; but during their transport to Europe many of these have fallen\r\nout, and were found at the bottom of the cases containing these curious\r\nrelics of American antiquity.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SLANDERS AGAINST DANIEL WEBSTER are noted in the English\r\nJournals in connection with his acceptance of the Secretaryship of State.\r\n\"These scandals,\" observes the _Spectator,_ \"cannot, however, hide from\r\nus the fact, that of all public men in America, _perhaps_ with one\r\nexception, Mr. Webster is he who has evinced the greatest knowledge of\r\npublic affairs, the greatest acumen in administration, and the greatest\r\ncommon sense in emergency.

The mounds within the\r\nwalls afford subjects of high interest to the historian and antiquarian;\r\nthey are filled, nay, I may say, they are literally composed of coffins,\r\npiled upon each other to the height of forty-five feet. It has,\r\nevidently, been the great burial-place of generations of Chaldeans, as\r\nMeshad Ali and Kerbella at the present day are of the Persians. The\r\ncoffins are very strange affairs; they are in general form like a\r\nslipper-bath, but more depressed and symmetrical, with a large oval\r\naperture to admit the body, which is closed with a lid of earthenware.\r\nThe coffins themselves are also of baked clay, covered with green glaze,\r\nand embossed with figures of warriors, with strange and enormous\r\ncoiffures, dressed in a short tunic and long under garments, a sword by\r\nthe side, the arms resting on the hips, the legs apart. Great quantities\r\nof pottery and also clay figures, some most delicately modeled, are found\r\naround them; and ornaments of gold, silver, iron, copper, glass, &c.,\r\nwithin.\"--_Art-Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANCIENT PRICE OF LABOR.--In the year 1352, 25th Edward III., wages paid\r\nto haymakers  were 1d. a day.

He thought the\r\nWord of God would have to be translated into two hundred languages before\r\nall the tribes of Africa will be able to read it in their own tongue. The\r\nMohammedans, who are spread through the length of the continent, have\r\nmany who can read the Koran in the Arabic characters. If, therefore, the\r\nWord of God were translated into their tongues and printed in that\r\ncharacter, many, not only of the Hovas and the Arabs of the desert, but\r\nalso of the Foolahs, Mandingoes, and Housah, who professed Mahommedanism,\r\nwould be able to read concerning Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM MR.

They expect to meet the many caravans\r\ncoming down from the interior to Ghat. The actual arrival of the chiefs\r\nwas greatly to the astonishment of the Moors and Turks of Mourzouk, who\r\ncould never believe that the hardy bandits of the Sahara would obey the\r\nsummons of a Christian, and escort English travelers through the\r\nunexplored regions of Central Africa. The Turks had on previous occasions\r\nrepeatedly invited the Touaricks to visit the town of Mourzouk, but they\r\nnever would do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE CONGRESS of Frankfort closed its session on the 22d of August.\r\nHowever commendable its apparent object, it cannot be concealed that this\r\nand the preceding congress of the same kind have been little more than\r\nprocesses for the elevation of insignificant people into a transient\r\nnotoriety. This year the usual philanthropic resolutions were passed.\r\nVictor Hugo, of France, excused himself from attendance on the score of\r\nill-health; but the country was represented by Emile de Girardin. The\r\ncongress is to meet next year simultaneously with the great World's\r\nExposition at London.

His courage and perseverance in that\r\nexpedition have given the public a sufficient pledge of the energy and\r\nconstancy of his character, and his scientific knowledge, educated as he\r\nhas been from his early childhood to be a naturalist, qualifies him as\r\nfew are qualified, for the superintendence of such an establishment.

But, though we\r\nwere a little prejudiced against the thoughts that it could be possible\r\nthat this metal should be so promiscuously and universally mingled with\r\ncommon earth, yet we endeavored to cleanse and wash the earth from some\r\nof it; and the more we did the more it appeared like gold. In order to be\r\nfurther satisfied, I brought away some of it, which we lost in our\r\nconfusion in China.'\" How an accident prevented the discovery, more than\r\na century back, of the golden harvest now gathering in California!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF PERU has issued a decree, appointing the Minister of the\r\nHome Department, Don Lucas Fonceas, Don Nicolas Pierola, and Don Nicolas\r\nRodrigo, a commission to select and take charge of articles intended to\r\nbe sent to England for exhibition next year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

It seems the said mummy was all right,\r\nin the right coffin duly embalmed; the body being that of a priest who\r\ndied about B. C. 900. The Theban undertakers, in this particular _case_,\r\nwere honest; and all suspicion of fraud on their part is unnecessary and\r\nunfair. Mr. Gliddon made a slight mistake, before the opening of the\r\ncoffin, in reading the fragments of the inscription; and so got the\r\nnotion that the contents were a female body.

Subsequent to, or in consequence of, the\r\ngreat failure of the potato crop in 1846--that calamity which\r\nrevolutionized Ireland--not less than a million of people must have left\r\nits shores to try their fortunes this side the Atlantic. Between\r\nemigration and the ravages of famine and pestilence, we may calculate\r\nthat the population of Ireland has diminished by at least a million and a\r\nhalf or two millions since the autumn of 1846. How long the emigration\r\nwill continue, it is, of course, impossible to predict, as every new\r\nsettler in America who prospers, is the agent by which a fresh demand is\r\nmade upon the old country. It is one of the best features in the Irish\r\ncharacter, that, in the new land to which they flock, they do not forget\r\nthe friends or relatives that they have left behind them, and that every\r\npacket carries money from America for the relief of people in Ireland, or\r\nto pay their passage out to the forests or prairies of a world where\r\nthere is elbow-room for all, and where a willing heart and a stout pair\r\nof hands are the surest passports to independence and a competency.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARKANTH TAGORE was a marvelously intelligent man, greatly in advance of\r\nhis countrymen--a man who could discern the value of European\r\ncivilization, and who devoted his energies and his means to the duty of\r\ngrafting them on Hindu society. His riches were, like all merchants', in\r\nsupposition. He had argosies, and lands, and merchandise; but what with\r\nland rats and water rats, and mortgages, glutted markets, and\r\ncompetitions of all kinds, that which had an untellable value to-day, was\r\nat a discount to-morrow. His influence in the southern provinces of India\r\nmaintained the credit of his house while he lived; he died bequeathing no\r\natom of his commanding spirit and exquisite tact, and the house which he\r\nhad created, together with the Bank he had sustained, fell in the general\r\ncommercial wreck which afflicted all Calcutta three years ago. Thus much\r\nof admirable Dwarkanth Tagore.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME BOULANGER--the Mrs. Glover of the Paris _Opéra Comique_, has a\r\nConspicuous place in the recent foreign obituaries. The French, in their\r\nmusical comedies, cherish _dramatis personæ_ of a maturity not known on\r\nany other musical stage, save among the background figures. \"So often as\r\nwe think of the good lady in question, with hardly a note of voice left,\r\nbut overflowing with quaint humor, and willingly turning her years and\r\nill looks to the utmost account, with a readiness to be absurd, if the\r\npart needed, which even a Lablache could not outdo,--so often as we\r\nrecollect her _Madame Barnek_, in 'L'Ambassadrice,' and her _La\r\nBocchetta_ in 'Polichinelle, some of our most comic operatic impressions\r\nwill be revived. Madame Boulanger was buried in the church of Notre\r\nDame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELING, in France, like everything else there, has been reduced to\r\nscience, or rather to art. Companies are now formed at Paris which convey\r\npassengers to London and back at an expense of only thirty francs--about\r\nsix dollars. They will pay all your expenses for this sum, and give you\r\nfour days in London to see all the lions. It took more time and more\r\nmoney a few years ago to journey from Paris to Rouen, which is only a\r\nfew miles off. These pleasure trains, as they are called, quit Paris on\r\nSaturday, cross the channel in a good steamer on Sunday, reaching London\r\nin the afternoon, give the voyagers Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and\r\nThursday in the city, leaving in time to get back to Paris by Friday\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR courses of lectures will be delivered the coming season before the\r\nLowell Institute, Boston.

The note of preparation had been sounding for half a\r\nyear; her name, through all the country, had become a household word;\r\nand every incident in her life, and every judgment of her capacities, had\r\nbeen made familiar, by the admirable tactician who had hazarded so much\r\nof his fortune in her engagement. The general interest was increased by\r\nthe accounts in the chief foreign journals of her triumphal progress\r\nthrough England, and when at length she reached New-York, her reception\r\nresembled the ovations that are offered to heroes. Her first concert was\r\ngiven at the Castle Amphitheater, on the 11th September, to the largest\r\naudience ever assembled for any such occasion in America. There was an\r\napprehension among the more judicious that the performances would fall\r\nbelow the common expectations; but the most sanguine were surprised by\r\nthe completeness of her triumph. She surpassed all that they had ever\r\nheard, or dreamed, or imagined. It was, as the _Christian Inquirer_\r\nhappily observes, as if all the birds of Eden had melted their voices\r\ninto one, to rise in gushing song upon the streaming light to salute the\r\nsun. Her later concerts have increased rather than diminished the\r\nenthusiasm produced by her first appearance. Mlle. Lind is accompanied\r\nby M. Benedict, the well known composer, and by Signer Belletti, whose\r\nvoice is the finest _baritone_ probably ever heard in New York, and whose\r\nstyle is described by the _Albion_ as \"near perfection.\" The orchestral\r\narrangements for her concerts have never been surpassed here. Many were\r\ndeterred from being present at her first appearance by a fear of crowds\r\nand tumults, but so perfect were Mr. Barnum's appointments that all the\r\nvast assemblies at the Castle have been as orderly as the most quiet\r\nevening parties in private houses.\r\n\r\nThe personal interest in Mlle. Lind is almost as great as the interest in\r\nthe singer. Her charities in New York have already reached more than\r\n$15,000. and it is understood that all the profits of her engagement in\r\nAmerica, not thus dispensed here, are appropriated by her for the\r\nestablishment of free schools in Sweden.\r\n\r\nMlle. Lind has given to the Fire Department Fund, $3,000; Musical Fund\r\nSociety, $2,000; Home for the Friendless, Society for the Relief of\r\nIndigent Females, Dramatic Fund Association, Home for Colored and Aged\r\nPersons, Colored and Orphan Association, Lying-in Asylum for Destitute\r\nFemales, New York Orphan Asylum, Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum, Roman\r\nCatholic Half-Orphan Asylum, and Old Ladies Asylum, each $500. Total,\r\n$10,000. The lives of Mr. Barnum, Jenny Lind, M. Benedict, and Signor\r\nBelletti, with all the details of the concerts, have been issued in a\r\npamphlet displaying the usual tyographical richness and elegance of Van\r\nNorden & Leslie, Fulton-street.",
