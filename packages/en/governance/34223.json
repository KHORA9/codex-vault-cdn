But the events of the succeeding period from the signature of\r\nthe Treaty to its ratification during the autumn and winter call for\r\nno alteration and but little addition to the text. The six months\r\nhereinafter described from February to August were a--perhaps\r\nthe--critical period for Germany and for Europe. It was the formative\r\nand creative stage for New Germany and for New Europe. If the whole\r\nphase through which Central Europe passed after the collapse of the\r\nCentral Powers is considered as the genesis of a new age, then the\r\nweek of actual revolution was a phase of intense heat and fierce\r\nenergy, in which the old political organisms were boiled down to their\r\nmost simple and essential types and in which the germs of new\r\npolitical institutions appeared in primitive forms such as the\r\nCouncils. Thereafter came the period under review, in which the old\r\nand new types fought for a survival of the fittest; and the old--aided\r\nby the general cooling off of the revolution--to some extent\r\nreasserted their supremacy. Indeed during this last winter I have even\r\noccasionally thought that the types of old Germany might succeed in\r\nsuppressing the new, thereby making it necessary to change the title\r\nand tone of this book. But I know this impression is largely due to\r\nthe pessimistic and perverted point of view towards all events in\r\nCentral Europe affected by the British Press with few exceptions. For\r\nour \"Dailies\" Germany is only a subject for \"scare heads\" and\r\n\"stories,\" in which adventurous special correspondents see the Kaiser\r\nemerging from the Netherlands to re-ravage Europe like the\r\nBrontosaurus out of the Nyassa swamp. Whereas the reality seems to be\r\nthat reaction has moderated as the revolution became more amenable,\r\nand that a \"modus vivendi\" between the two is now more of a\r\npossibility than it was.\r\n\r\nIt now seems less probable than it did last summer that the solution\r\nin Germany will be a \"second revolution\" as in Russia. Weak as it is\r\npolitically, the present German governmental system seems too strong\r\npolice-ically to be overthrown by force. The situation to-day in\r\nGermany rather suggests that in Great Britain two years hence than\r\nthat in Russia two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe new Germany of this winter of 1919-20 is essentially, then, the\r\nsame as that of last summer. It is not the old Germany of the autumn\r\nof 1914, nor the young Germany of the autumn of 1917. But it has\r\ndeveloped rapidly in some respects in the course of this winter. Thus\r\nthe rough and ready rule by Frei-Corps expeditions and garrisons has\r\nbeen supplemented by a gendarmerie (_Sicherheitswehr_); and the\r\nmiddle-class militia (_Buergerwehr_) has been replaced by an\r\norganisation of armed special constables (_Einwohnerwehr_).\r\n\r\nThe effect and perhaps the object of this change is to obscure the class\r\ncharacter of the conflict between reaction and revolution--between\r\nproperty and the proletariat. The police is no longer a weapon for use\r\nby a possible militarist reaction or monarchist restoration, and in\r\nreturn it will be supported by the moderate revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nReaction and revolution are reuniting as reconstruction; and this\r\ntendency appears in all regions of political activity. Thus the\r\nrevolutionary Council system now seems established as a secondary\r\nrepresentative institution supplementary to Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis development is, however, not due to maturity of political\r\nexperience--as it would be in similar conditions in an Anglo-Saxon\r\ncommunity--but merely to mortal weakness. German political vitality,\r\nowing to mediaeval calamities, has always been low in modern times.\r\nNow, as a result of a four years' frenzy of war and a fifth year in a\r\nfever of revolution, German political vitality is a very flickering\r\nflame. So long as France and Great Britain continue to enforce the\r\nprinciples and procedures of the Treaty of Versailles and of the Paris\r\nCouncil, Germany will remain a danger to Europe--a danger, not because\r\nof its recent relapse into a Conservative reaction, nor even because\r\nof the decreasing risk of a Communist \"second\" revolution, but because\r\nGermany is an essential and vital member of our European body politic\r\nthat is being kept in a morbid, even moribund, condition by the\r\nprovisions of the peace. The Paris diplomatists have not yet learnt\r\nthe lesson taught by a great French diplomatist two hundred years ago\r\nat the time of the last great European settlement but one. M. de\r\nCallieres then wrote in his treatise on diplomacy--\"We must think of\r\nthe States of which Europe is composed as being joined ... in such a\r\nway that they may be regarded as members of one Republic, and that no\r\nconsiderable change can take place in any one of them without\r\naffecting the condition or disturbing the peace of all the others.\"\r\n\r\nA majority of the rank and file of Greater Britain does so think of\r\nGermany to-day, but unless and until it can compel its rulers to act\r\naccordingly it will not get peace. Peace is only for men of good will.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTMAS, 1919.\r\n        65, STRAND ON THE GREEN,\r\n            CHISWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  THE REVOLUTION                                                     1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  THE REACTION                                                      26\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  THE COUNCIL REPUBLICS                                             63\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  RUIN AND RECONSTRUCTION                                          120\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  COUNCIL GOVERNMENT                                               163\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES                                         198\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  THE CONSTITUTION                                                 242\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                            327\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in January, 1919, I resigned my commission and made my way out\r\nto Berlin as correspondent for the _Daily News_, I had two purposes in\r\nview. One was to find out to what extent we had really won the war--in\r\nthe only way it could be won--by forcing the German people into\r\nrevolution; and incidentally to take any opportunity that might offer\r\nof furthering that revolution. My second purpose was to find out what\r\nprospects there were of making a more or less permanent peace--in the\r\nonly way it could be made--by establishing the forces of reform in\r\nGermany; and incidentally to point out any openings favourable to the\r\nfurthering of such a peace. The following book brings together and\r\nsums up conclusions communicated to the _Daily News_ from time to\r\ntime and is put forward as an answer to the double question: Have we\r\nwon the war against Prussianism and have we made a permanent peace?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question was only to be got in Berlin. The first\r\nmistake made by the soldiers and workers who had won the war was in\r\nnot insisting on their representatives making peace with the German\r\npeople and at Berlin. An experience of twenty years in diplomacy,\r\nbeginning with the arbitration treaties of Lord Pauncefote and ending\r\nwith those of Lord Bryce, followed by two years of war experience,\r\nbeginning with political secret service and ending in the ranks, had\r\nconvinced me from the first that true peace could only be got by\r\ndeveloping the forces of democracy of the defeated peoples centering\r\nin Berlin, and not by any bickerings between diplomatic formulae of the\r\nvictorious Governments collected in Paris. That is why I preferred\r\ngoing as a journalist to Berlin rather than in any other capacity to\r\nParis. And that is why the following papers are published. They show\r\nthat anyone who spent the first six months of 1919 in Berlin and the\r\nbig German towns would have seen easily enough how it was that, in\r\nspite of military occupations and religious thanksgivings and bonfires\r\nand bonuses all round, we were not winning the war but losing it: and\r\nhow, in spite of territorial partitions and financial reparations, and\r\nsignatures with gold pens and the setting-up of a League of Nations,\r\nwe were not making peace but manufacturing wars. We have not yet won\r\nthe war because we have not as yet supported in Germany the\r\nprogressive--that is, the revolutionary--elements and suppressed the\r\nPrussian--that is, the reactionary--spirit: while we have, of late,\r\nbeen really losing the war by actually assisting German reaction\r\nagainst German revolution. And we are doing this just from the\r\nignorance of our democracy and the _insouciance_ of our diplomacy.\r\n\r\nOur democracy has been prevented from ascertaining, and our diplomacy\r\nhas been precluded from understanding what the German revolution\r\nreally means, both to Germany and to Great Britain. Although we are\r\nslow to understand foreign movements, yet ignorance of such a movement\r\nas this would have been impossible but for the conditions under which\r\nthe war closed. The German revolution, banned, boycotted, and\r\nblockaded, became to us a stone of offence, an odious ruin of the war,\r\nand so we failed to recognise it as the only possible foundation stone\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nThe six months I spent in Germany were none too much to realise the\r\nradical and rapid changes going on; and I can see how difficult it has\r\nbeen for English readers to get an idea of what is really happening\r\nthere from the little that has been written about it. They cannot do\r\nso at all unless they clear their minds of the cartoons and\r\ncaricatures and cliches forced on them during the last five years by\r\nthe propaganda and the Press. It is no use drawing Germany from the\r\nlife for people who still have before their eyes the \"Boches\" and\r\n\"Bolsheviks\" of _Punch_ and _John Bull_. One has, indeed, to clear\r\naway two strata of misrepresentation, that of our Government and Press\r\nand that of the German Government and Press; for the latter is as much\r\nopposed to the German revolution as the former.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better for Germany had it shown more courage and\r\ncollapsed less completely last autumn. A few weeks' patient endurance\r\nunder punishment in a losing fight would have gone far towards\r\nrestoring it some measure of the sympathies of the civilised world.\r\nWhile the consequent occupation of the whole country would have\r\nbrought us into direct contact with the German revolution, and would\r\nhave prevented the fatal split between reformers and revolutionaries,\r\nbetween Majority and Independent Socialists. As it was, we English\r\nwere left to draw such conclusions as we could from the reports of the\r\nfew correspondents who penetrated to Berlin. But, with two exceptions,\r\nthe English Press could at this time publish nothing about Germany\r\nthat was not merely malevolent. And of the few Englishmen in Berlin as\r\ncorrespondents in January, almost all were replaced before the Treaty\r\nof Peace by foreign Jews who would supply the sort of propaganda\r\npoppycock with which public opinion is still being poisoned.\r\n\r\nWhat people in England wanted to know was whether the German\r\nrevolution was a real riddance of the evil we had been fighting and a\r\nreal renascence of good that we could favour; whether it had gone far\r\nenough and deep enough to be a sincere repentance and a sufficient\r\nremediation. For, unless Germany was born again, it could not enter\r\nthe community of nations, and until it did so, there could be no true\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThey could guess that Kaiserism was dead and gone and Junkerism down\r\nand out. But even so picturesque and positive an event as the fall of\r\nKaiserism had been only baldly mentioned in a bare telegram of a line\r\nor two. How could the British public realise that the Black Eagle of\r\nPrussia was no Phoenix and that the blaze of November 9 had left\r\nnothing of it but a bad odour and a white feather.\r\n\r\nBut in Berlin there could be no doubt. Kaiserism was dead--deader even\r\nthan Tsarism--because the Kaiser was still alive. His shot-shattered\r\nand mob-swept palace was the only reminder of him. And every Berliner\r\nhad more or less vivid recollections of his fall, recollections too\r\nlamentable, too ludicrous, to allow of any restoration of the Kaiser\r\nlegend even now.\r\n\r\nAfter reading your morning paper about revolution in Dublin and revolt\r\nin Glasgow and reconstruction in London, as you walk down to your\r\noffice past the Dutch decorum of Kensington Palace, the Scotch\r\nskimpiness of St. James's, or the generous Germanosities of Buckingham\r\nPalace, does it ever occur to you to wonder what goes on in a palace\r\nwhen there is a revolution?\r\n\r\nWell, this is what happened to the Kaiserschloss in Berlin on November\r\n8.\r\n\r\nThe curious crowd that always collects outside the house of anyone\r\nmentioned in the papers, whether it's an absconded postmaster or an\r\nabdicated potentate, found that the sentries no longer challenged\r\nthem, and first filtered, then flooded into the inner courts.\r\nThereupon the police and guards left, and the palace remained in\r\ncharge only of the Kastellan and a few servants and soldiers. All\r\ndoors were kept locked, and beyond some shouting everything was\r\norderly, for the prestige of the Imperial precincts still prevailed.\r\n\r\nThen one Schwieringer, not otherwise distinguished, made his way to\r\nthe Kastellan and got leave to address the crowd from a window. Having\r\ndraped the balcony with a red cloth borrowed for the purpose, he\r\ndeclared the palace national property. This broke the spell somewhat.\r\nThe rest of the soldiers left, and the crowd became noisy.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon came Liebknecht, who engaged another balcony,\r\nborrowed more red curtains, made another speech, and after holding a\r\nsort of levee in the Throne Room left again. Later came soldiers and\r\nhoisted a red flag. So far the Kastellan had remained master of the\r\nsituation, conducting his unwelcome visitors through the rooms,\r\nunlocking and locking behind him as on ordinary occasions with any\r\nordinary tourists.\r\n\r\nThen on November 10 came one Bujakowski, with a Slavonic eye for the\r\npossibilities of the situation. Having collected such soldiers and\r\ncivilians as were hanging about, he made them a speech, and called on\r\nthem to elect a council, and himself Commandant of the Castle, which\r\nthey did. He then said he must have a suitable uniform. The council\r\nagreed, and appointed a delegation to make selections from the\r\nImperial wardrobe.\r\n\r\nHappy delegates--happy, happy Bujakowski! Five hundred uniforms and,\r\nsay, five pieces to each. How many combinations does that give in\r\nwhich to find the perfect expression of a Spartacist commandant of a\r\nHohenzollern castle. He did his best in the time no doubt. Delegate\r\nSchwartz, try a combination of those English and Hungarian uniforms!\r\nDelegate Schmidt, see if that hunting costume goes with a Turkish fez!\r\nHistory does not record the result, beyond a cavilling incrimination\r\nabout a diamond-headed cane. But it must have been effective, for the\r\nCommandant returned from the Reichstag with his commission confirmed.\r\nThe rest of the company played up to his spirited lead, and the next\r\nmorning his \"adjutant\" attempted a _coup d'etat_. Bujakowski\r\nsuppressed it with a revolver, but was, however, deposed a day or two\r\nlater by an ex-convict, who generously appointed him his secretary.\r\n\r\nThese three men then formed a triumvirate, which spent most of its\r\ntime making excursions in fancy dress with the imperial cars, and,\r\noddly enough, kept the castle in fairly good condition. It was not\r\nuntil the sailors' revolutionary corps turned them out that all order\r\ndisappeared. Some ten commandants then succeeded each other rapidly.\r\nThe seventh shot the sixth, and was knocked on the head by the eighth.\r\nThe palace became a resort of bad characters, and was stripped bare.\r\nEventually, it was retaken by force, and the sailors were ejected.\r\n\r\nBerliners shake their heads over the loss, estimated in millions (of\r\nwar marks). But I don't know that there is much to lament. Personally,\r\nI am grateful to Bujakowski. His burlesque buffoonery has exorcised\r\nthe Imperial incubus that still brooded over the deserted shrine of\r\ndeparted littleness, and I forgive him for his share in destroying or\r\ndispersing some of the ugliest _objets d'art_ in Europe.\r\n\r\nKaiserism died when William the Second fled to Amerongen and\r\nBujakowski broke into his wardrobe. Nor has it been revived by the\r\nrevulsion in favour of William of Hohenzollern that we have evoked by\r\nour proposal to put him on his trial in England. We have thereby\r\nrallied in his support many adherents of the monarchical principle who\r\nhad previously abandoned him, and by persisting in making a martyr of\r\nhim, by taking him out of this German pillory and by putting him on an\r\ninternational pedestal, we have already opened the door to a\r\nrestoration of the Hohenzollern dynasty as a constitutional monarchy.\r\nThis would mean a restoration of Junkerism and Prussianism, but not of\r\nKaiserism. That peculiar blend of divine right and demagogy is gone\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nAnd what about Junkerism? That cannot be so shortly answered.\r\nJunkerism expresses itself in both regions of the ruling class to\r\nwhich Germany has been hitherto subjected--the civil and the military.\r\nIt is the evil genius of both those great services; and seldom has the\r\nworld produced public services with so much power for good in them and\r\nso much evil as in the German army and bureaucracy. And it is\r\nindisputable that the fate of Germany and the future of Europe now\r\ndepend on whether the revolutionary spirit is strong enough to\r\nexorcise the evil genius of Prussianism and of Junkerism from the army\r\nand civil service. But the question as to how far, so far, Germany's\r\ngood angel has fired its bad one out can only be answered as yet by a\r\ncareful and impartial observation of events in Germany since the\r\nrevolution. And if these events seem to suggest that the revolution\r\nhas lost its impetus and that reaction has dominated it, let us\r\nremember that the results of a renascence of public conscience, such\r\nas occurred in the November revolutions, should be estimated by\r\ncomparing the concrete conditions of to-day, not with the abstract\r\nprinciples then for a time extant, but with the concrete conditions\r\nexisting before the upheaval.\r\n\r\nAs most have already got or can easily get a general knowledge of what\r\ngeneral conditions in Germany were before the revolution of November\r\nand of what were the general principles promulgated by the revolution,\r\nmuch of what follows will consist of evidence as to how far the\r\nrevolution has so far failed in realising those principles. For\r\nrevolution has now resulted in a reaction in which every vantage point\r\ngained by the first revolutionary rush is counter-attacked and every\r\nearly victory is contested again. As every consequent loss cannot be\r\nreferred back to the deadlock before the offensive the general\r\nimpression is that of failure. But the Prussianism that now fills\r\nGerman prisons with political suspects is rather a reflection of\r\nreaction abroad than a revival of the ancient _regime_.\r\n\r\nBy the first rush of revolution in November 1918, the military power\r\nof the officer caste was broken and the political power of land and\r\nmoney was reduced to insignificance. But there was no strong obstacle\r\nto their recovery, and the power of the bureaucracy was unimpaired.\r\nThough the instigators of the crimes of the old _regime_ had been\r\nremoved, the instruments remained; while the 'Independent'\r\nintellectuals, the public prosecutors of those crimes, were before\r\nlong voted down. And yet before we refuse absolution to the new German\r\ndemocracy we must be quite sure that these relapses are real\r\nunregeneracy and not reactions caused by fear of Russian revolution on\r\nthe one side or Allied retribution on the other. We can only judge of\r\nthis by reviewing the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe history of the German revolution can be shortly described and\r\nsharply defined. After the first explosion on November 9 came a month\r\nof equilibrium between revolution and reaction. Then a month of which\r\nthe first fortnight was a swing slowly to the right until the breach\r\nwith the Independents on December 24, and a swing swiftly the second\r\nfortnight until the fighting with the Spartacists in January.\r\nThereafter a month of rapid return to the point where it was before\r\nthe explosion, a point reached with the formation of the Coalition\r\nGovernment by the National Assembly on February 13. Indeed the\r\nGovernment of Scheidemann only differed from that of Max von Baden in\r\nbeing one degree more to the left, a development which was due in any\r\ncase apart from the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe German revolution is peculiar in having reached its highest point\r\nat once and in having then relapsed to where it started from without\r\nany positive reaction. This in itself suggests that it was due in its\r\norigin to external forces--propaganda from Russia on the one side and\r\npressure from us on the other. Our military and naval pressure broke\r\nfirst the prestige then the power of Kaiserism and Militarism, while\r\nthe Russian precedent gave the forces of rebellion and revolution a\r\npractical example how to express themselves in co-ordinated councils\r\nof workmen and soldiers--the Soviet system. We knocked German\r\nKaiserism out of the saddle, and Russia gave German Socialism a leg\r\nup. And that's why it went so far so fast.\r\n\r\nThat's also why it never got anywhere. For it came to power before it\r\ndeveloped its own personalities and policies, and it had, therefore,\r\nto put its trust in pre-revolutionary politicians. The Council system\r\nhad no time to produce leaders--men with enough confidence in their\r\nown position and enough character to impose themselves on the\r\npermanent officials. The Central Council--the true revolutionary\r\nExecutive--and the Congress of Councils--the true revolutionary\r\nLegislature--never got any power. It was all monopolised by the\r\nPeople's Commissioners, who were not really a revolutionary\r\ninstitution at all, but an ordinary Provisional Government of\r\nparliamentarians. And though they nominally held their mandate from\r\nthe Congress of Councils a majority of them considered themselves as\r\ntrustees for a Constituent Assembly. Such parliamentarians could work\r\nwell enough with the permanent officials, and, indeed, welcomed their\r\nassistance. Whereas the councils, of course, came into violent\r\ncollision with them.\r\n\r\nWhere the council system prevailed, as in the army, it made a real\r\nrevolution, and broke the officer caste until the Frei-Corps replaced\r\nthe conscript army. But the workmen were not so drastic in the civil\r\nservice as were the soldiers in the cadres, and they allowed the\r\nparliamentarians to spare the Amalekite. Only the political heads of\r\ndepartments were replaced by Social Democrats; and, in one case I\r\nknow, a revolutionary Minister allowed his predecessor, out of\r\ncourtesy, to keep his official residence. This was, of course, all\r\nvery nice, but it meant that the old machine was not broken up, nor\r\neven brought under control. The result was that a coalition between\r\nthe mere reformers among the commissioners and the civil servants was\r\nenough to counter-balance the more revolutionary commissioners and the\r\ncouncils; until finally external circumstances determined the deadlock\r\nin favour of the former.\r\n\r\nThe German revolution never took its Bastille in the Wilhelmstrasse.\r\nThe sentries set by the Soldiers' Councils at the doors of the\r\nGovernment offices, who loudly demanded your pass and only looked\r\nfoolish if you ignored them, were symbolic of the failure of the\r\nGerman revolution. So insignificant were these sentinels of revolution\r\nthat no one saw the significance when they were finally replaced by\r\nsteel-helmeted Frei-Corps mercenaries last April. By the first week of\r\nDecember it had become evident that the course of events was leading\r\naway from the Congress of Councils to the Constituent Assembly, and\r\naway from social revolution to political reconstruction. The Central\r\nCouncil that should have been the driving-wheel of the Socialist\r\nengine was becoming no more than a drag shoe on the old State coach.\r\n\r\nBefore the German revolution was a month old--that is, by the end of\r\nthe first week of December--it was entering its second phase, in which\r\nthe Parliamentary Commissioners having ousted the proletarian councils\r\nfrom control, then divided among themselves into reformers and\r\nrevolutionaries. And at the end of the second phase, early in January,\r\nwe find that the reformers have ousted the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThis came about thus. The German Social Democratic Party was\r\nprofessedly revolutionary. Its political attitude had been\r\ntraditionally one of refusal of all co-operation or even compromise\r\nwith the imperial political system. On this negative basis it had been\r\npossible to combine in a common front comrades of very different\r\npoints of view and of political thought. But this superficial\r\nsolidarity could not stand the strain of the war. A sense of\r\npatriotism carried one section--the Majority Socialists--first into\r\ncountenancing and then into supporting the Government; while pacifist\r\nsentiment against war in general, and this war in particular, carried\r\nthe minority into more obstinate opposition. This finally split the\r\nparty much as it split our Labour Party. The Majority Social-Democrats\r\nmoved towards the Government, while the Government towards the end of\r\nthe war came to meet them. Until finally the Ministry of Prince Max of\r\nBaden, that ended the war, not only represented the Reichstag\r\nmajority, but also the Majority Social-Democrats.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Max went down in the revolution, he remitted the reins of\r\ngovernment to Ebert and Scheidemann. They, knowing that alone they could\r\nnot rule the whirlwind, called in the Minority Social-Democrats--the\r\nIndependents, offering them equal representation in the Cabinet, then\r\ncalled the People's Commissaries, and in the Central Council. This\r\narrangement was ratified by the Congress of Councils, though very\r\nperfunctorily, as it was considered only a provisional makeshift.\r\n\r\nNow, while the Social-Democrats of the Majority were just\r\nparliamentary reformers, the Independents of the Minority, Haase and\r\nKautsky, were revolutionaries. Liebknecht was a radical revolutionary\r\nwho would not come into the Coalition. Consequently, whereas Ebert and\r\nScheidemann considered themselves as merely Commissioners to prepare a\r\nConstituent Assembly, the Independents considered themselves\r\nCommissaries for the Congress of Councils. The former considered the\r\nrevolution was probably unnecessary, and in any case had done its work\r\nin preparing the way for universal suffrage and a united Germany. The\r\nlatter considered that the revolution had only begun, and could only\r\ndo its work through the Soviet system and a general socialisation.\r\n\r\nThe first serious difference came over the Poles, with whom the\r\nIndependents had practically concluded an arrangement which was,\r\nhowever, upset by Landsberg, a Jew from Posen, one of the People's\r\nCommissaries. Then came serious differences over German policy\r\ntowards the Entente. The Independents were in favour of admitting\r\nculpability in the war crisis, Belgium, submarine warfare, etc., and\r\nof accepting such liability as might be shown to be equitable, while\r\nfrankly discussing such assets as could be realised in payment. This\r\nthe Majority rejected, preferring a negative policy of passive\r\ninaction. But the final breach came over internal policy and the use\r\nof force against the revolutionaries, the Communists, who were trying\r\nto force the revolution out of the rut of parliamentary reform into\r\nwhich it was slipping.\r\n\r\nThis Communist Left, commanded but not controlled by Liebknecht, was\r\nworking for a second revolution in alliance with Russian agents. Its\r\nfighting faction, that called itself \"Spartacus\"--with the accent on\r\nthe second syllable--was strong in the industrial districts of the\r\ncentre and west, among the sailors in the coast towns, and in Berlin.\r\nIts ranks were filled rapidly with discontented workmen, disbanded\r\nsoldiers, and \"derailed\" youths. Rifles were plentiful, and against\r\nsuch irregulars, supported by sailors, the Government was at first\r\nhelpless. But as the regulars that had kept their ranks returned from\r\nthe front it was found that some regiments were ready to act against\r\nthe mob. Such a policy was denounced by the Independents, Haase and\r\nKautsky, while Ebert, perhaps also Scheidemann, had doubts; but\r\nLandsberg, who had found a strong man in Noske, the Prussian War\r\nMinister, drove matters to a breach. On the first fighting with the\r\nsailors at the Marstall on December 23, Haase and Kautsky resigned.\r\nThus the intellectual and idealist element of the revolution was\r\nremoved from all influence over the conduct of affairs. The result was\r\nto cause in January a fight to a finish between the Real-politikers of\r\nthe Government and the Radicals of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nPolice precautions against the Russian agents, combined with a Press\r\npropaganda against the Spartacists, provoked the latter to action.\r\nThey seized the offices of the _Vorwaerts_ and other papers most\r\noffensive to them, and used them for publishing their own pamphlets.\r\nThey had not apparently planned anything more than a demonstration,\r\nand did not anyhow exploit the success they had seized by surprise.\r\nThe Government, however, after some difficulty in concentrating and\r\nsupplying sufficient troops, converted the \"putsch\" into a pitched\r\nbattle. Noske regulars with all the machinery of modern war, made\r\nshort work of the half-hearted half-armed irregulars of Eichhorn, the\r\nSpartacist Police Commissioner. The revolution was crushed in Berlin\r\nand driven back to the coast ports, whence it came and whither it\r\ncould later be pursued. Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, its Berlin\r\nleaders, were arrested and at once brutally murdered by their escort\r\nwith the approval and assistance of the officers in charge. This\r\nmurder, perfectly well known in Berlin at the time, was only proved by\r\ncourt-martial four months later, after which the culprits were allowed\r\nto escape abroad.\r\n\r\nSo the Independents having committed hari-kari and the Spartacists\r\nbeing hoist with their own petard, middle-class and moderate Germany\r\nheaved a sigh of relief, and hoped that the bogey of Bolshevism was\r\nburied. The elections to the National Assembly were held a few days\r\nlater without disturbance, and the German revolution entered its third\r\nand last phase.\r\n\r\nThe German revolution which began in November--in old German the\r\n\"Month of Fogs\"--and ended in February--the \"Month of Fools\"--was\r\nfogged from the beginning and fooled to the end. Its third and last\r\nphase began about the middle of January with the establishing of\r\nprovisional government by the moderate Majority Socialists, the\r\ncrushing of Spartacus, and the elections. The radical opposition had\r\ntried to delay the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, partly\r\nbecause it was for the moment discredited by its secession from the\r\nCoalition and its connection with the Communists, and partly because\r\nit recognised that a reaction towards nationalism and conservatism had\r\nalready been set up by the attitude of the Allies and would be given\r\nexaggerated expression at the polls. The drift of a weakened and\r\nwearied mass can raise a dictator to \"save society\"; only the driving\r\npower of a devoted and determined minority can realise a social\r\nrevolution. But the Independents had missed their opportunity of\r\nseizing power and securing such foreign support for the revolution as\r\nthey had earned by their attitude on the war. Their subsequent policy\r\nof obstruction had as little success as it deserved.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February, when the new Government was proclaimed at\r\nWeimar, a communist revolution had been converted into a\r\nconstitutionalist reconstruction; and that this corresponded with the\r\ndesire of the majority of the people was shown by the election result.\r\nEvery man and woman over twenty was entitled to vote, and a high\r\npercentage did so; while the system of proportional representation\r\nemployed, whatever its defects, at least gave a fair numerical\r\nrepresentation of the party presentments of public opinion. As in the\r\nEnglish election, nationalism decided the issue in favour of the\r\nparty in power. The Independent opposition was discredited by\r\nBolshevism, the Conservative opposition by Kaiserism. Apart from the\r\nwomen the Social-Democrats would probably have had an independent\r\nmajority; but, as was shown by the Pfalz results in which the women's\r\nvoices were kept separate, they were more conservative and clerical\r\nthan the men. As it was, the Majority Socialists with 163 out of 423\r\nmembers were forced into alliance, not with the Independent Socialists\r\nwho had only 22 votes, but with the Democratic Liberals who had 75.\r\nAnd as this relieved them of all responsibility to the revolution\r\nthere was no reason why they should not further strengthen their\r\nparliamentary position by taking in the Clerical Centre with its 55\r\nvotes as well. And thus Germany got from losing the war a coalition as\r\nstrong parliamentarily and as weak politically as that which winning\r\nthe war gave to us.\r\n\r\nWhile the revolution was being side-tracked in Parliament, it was\r\nbeing sandbagged in the Proletariat. A division of Frei-Corps with all\r\nthe machinery of modern war, tanks, aeroplanes, etc., was sent against\r\nthe north-western coast ports where the revolution had originated and\r\nwhere Spartacus was pursuing its policy of aggravating the food\r\ndifficulty by preventing the sailing of food ships as arranged under\r\nthe armistice. Bremen was entered by force, after fighting; and the\r\nother towns opened negotiations. On the eastern frontier a front was\r\nformed against the Poles, who had occupied nearly all Posen province,\r\nand fighting continued until the Allies stopped it. Great efforts were\r\nmade to get together some sort of effective force as a basis for\r\ngovernment; and the resultant Frei-Corps, though at this early date\r\nstill few and inferior, were already enough to give check to the\r\n\"Bolshevist\" menace within and without the frontier. Meantime the\r\nwhole \"soviet\" system of councils was practically 'frozen out' and\r\npolitically 'snowed under.' The Central Council was got to abdicate in\r\nfavour of the Constituent Assembly: the Socialisation Commission to\r\nwhich execution of the economic revolution had been referred, resigned\r\n_re infecta_: while the Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils were quietly\r\nignored. A Provisional Constitution was published in which all ideas\r\nof a centralised Socialist republic were abandoned, and the federal\r\nReich was restored with the substitution of presidents for princes.\r\nFinally the seat of the Assembly was transferred to Weimar,\r\nprofessedly to steep it in the sedative atmosphere of the old\r\npre-Prussian \"Kultur\" of the philosophers and poets, and practically\r\nto withdraw it from the too stimulating atmosphere of Berlin, which\r\nwas still an Independent stronghold. Even so might a demoralised and\r\ndemocratised England placate a victorious and Victorian America by\r\ntransferring parliament to the Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\nAll these strong measures were really signs of weakness. Spartacus had\r\nto be put down to please the Allies, the Poles pushed back to please\r\nthe nationalists, the Clericals bribed with Government posts to\r\ncounteract French bids for their support in separatist intrigues. The\r\nconstitution had to conciliate particularist sentiment in Prussia and\r\nthe southern principalities because this sentiment prevailed in the\r\ngeneral exhaustion of national and revolutionary forces. The old\r\ndriving power of national sentiment, so much abused during the war and\r\nthat might still have been called on for a desperate national defence,\r\nwas worn out. The new energy of the revolution had been wasted; and\r\nthe country, so far as its government was concerned, was back where it\r\nwas when the revolution broke out, materially much the worse for its\r\nthree months' excursion into revolution. In a word, the spirit of the\r\nnew German Government was diplomatic not democratic. The revolution\r\nhad come full circle and the Scheidemann Government of April might\r\nhave been the Government of Max von Baden of six months before.\r\n\r\nMorally, however, it was not the old Germany that had bowed before the\r\n\"forty-seven Princes hats.\" It had brought back with it from the\r\nperilous peaks and bottomless abysses of revolution a wider outlook\r\nand a deeper insight. And if it returned from its adventure only more\r\nweary and wasted it had at least learned to lift up its eyes to the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a quarter of a century ago I arrived in Weimar fresh from Eton,\r\nand as a budding diplomatist was invited to dinner by the Grand Duke.\r\nThe ceremony was a credit to the Court of Pumpernickel. Exactly a week\r\nbefore there came caracoling to the door what might have been one of\r\nNapoleon's marshals, and was one of the Weimar army. For Weimar had\r\nthen an army whose business it was to deliver invitations about a foot\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nThen on the evening itself and just half an hour before dinner,\r\nappeared a Court carriage and pair, in which you drove through the\r\nancient Barbican of the Castle to a flourish of trumpets. Next came\r\npresentation to Serenissimus, a very big, very grand old gentleman,\r\nwho was always urbanely inane except when he was inanely urbane. After\r\nthat came presentation to the Grand Duchess, a very little, very grand\r\nold lady, who sat in a glass case. This was said to be on account of\r\ndraughts, but she looked so fragile and precious that no maid could\r\never have been trusted with dusting her. The only time I ever saw her\r\ntaken out of it was for a presentation of Orders of Merit to deserving\r\ndomestics--an institution of her own which Royalty might adopt with\r\nadvantage in these days when K.C.M.G.'s are commoner than kitchen\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\nAnd now arriving in Germany fresh from the Army, I was again invited\r\nto an evening party at the Schloss. But times have changed and the\r\nSchloss has been promoted from the seat of a Grand Duke of a\r\nmediatised and mediaeval principality to the seat of government of a\r\nmodern and middle-class German Republic.\r\n\r\nThe guard in the old Barbican no longer proclaimed my arrival on a\r\ntrumpet, but presented a very business-like looking bayonet. Inside\r\nthe Castle the State apartments were severely bare, as befits\r\ndemocratic simplicity. And instead of bland and blethering\r\nSerenissimus I was received by Scheidemann blandly, blandishingly\r\nserene. Instead of gold-laced grandees dining off gold plates I find a\r\njob lot of journalists bolting \"belegte Broedchen\"; and if there were\r\nfewer good things to be eaten there were many more to be heard.\r\nEverything struck me first as completely different and then as\r\ncuriously the same as ever. Only the Dresden china Grand Duchess had\r\nno republican reincarnation.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps some day I shall find a still newer Weimar, the centre of\r\na twentieth century Germany that will rise from the ashes of the\r\nnineteenth century and the dust of the eighteenth. Not the\r\npicturesque, poetic Weimar of the past, nor the practical, prosaic\r\nWeimar of the present, but a Weimar of wide vistas and broad views, in\r\nwhich Young Germany will learn to plan the future.\r\n\r\nAnd as I dreamed of this new Weimar, walking back through the moonlit\r\nstreets of the picturesque old town I was roused by the rumbling of\r\nfield-guns on the march against the revolution. The drivers and\r\ngunners, hidden under their helmets and heavy cloaks, hunched on their\r\nsaddles or huddled on the guns, were borne by slowly, silently,\r\nshapeless shifting shadows, passing out from the town where a few\r\nlights still shone, into the dark. The New Germany is not yet.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when Weimar was only the German Stratford-on-Avon,\r\nthe theatre was the centre of local society. The first thing you did\r\non arrival was to present yourself and a box of cigars to the old\r\ngentleman in the box-office and get a seat for the season from which\r\nyou could survey from a respectful distance the social lights on the\r\nstage and the serene luminaries in the Grand Ducal box.\r\n\r\nBut nowadays, when the stage of the Weimar Theatre has become the seat\r\nof Government, it is as hard to get a ticket for a session of the\r\nAssembly as it used to be for the Selamlik of Abdul Hamid.\r\nIncidentally, Germany is to-day much more like Turkey than its old,\r\nwell-fed-up, well-fitted-out self. Dingy soldiers everywhere, dirt,\r\ndecay and deprivation everywhere, listlessness and laissez-faire on\r\nthe surface, with unrest and upheaval below.\r\n\r\nBut once inside the theatre things are not so different from the old\r\ndays. The young ladies from the pensions can still \"schwaermen\" for the\r\ndebonnaire premier Scheidemann or the distingue Brockdorff-Rantzau, or\r\n\"schauern\" at handsome Koenen, the saturnine Tribune of Halle, or at\r\nMerges, the hunchback tailor of Brunswick. But personally I find a\r\nWeimar \"Full Session\" about as entertaining and enlightening as was\r\nWeimar Grand Opera. A stout elderly gentleman advances to the centre\r\nof the stage and reads steadily and stolidly through a pile of\r\ntypewritten recitative. The Independents, who go in for bravura and\r\neven gag a little, are now nearly always away on tour in the\r\nprovinces. So the Assembly can continue daily from three to six\r\ndigesting a pleasantly conservative Constitution and a pleasingly\r\nliberal lunch. For Weimar is an oasis of peace and plenty in a land\r\nswept by famine and fighting. Yet even the sleepy backwater of\r\nThuringia has become a whirlpool of revolution, and Weimar was then\r\nringed in by a region of revolutionary strikes that threatened it from\r\nthree sides. One day a scouting party of Spartacists would be arrested\r\nat the station, on another the line to Berlin would be cut by a strike\r\nin some northern town.\r\n\r\nThe first week of the National Assembly was nominally occupied with\r\nsuch formal matters as appointing a President, voting the provisional\r\nconstitution, pronouncements on foreign policy, and programmes of\r\nlegislation. But naturally what most concerned everyone was the novel\r\nand fascinating business of Cabinet-making. The game was played with\r\ngreat spirit up to the finish, and the night before the final\r\nannouncement had to be made the Cabinet was once more reconstructed.\r\n\r\nIt was hard on Germany that its first-born Cabinet should have been\r\ntriplets, a trinity of the three co-eternal and co-equal\r\nparties--radical, neutral, and reactionary. But if the present\r\npolitical system was to be maintained and given a majority its\r\nSocial-Democratic supporters had to be reinforced from the two\r\nparties next to the right, the Democrats and the Centre. For the\r\nIndependent Socialists to the left were intransigent and in voting\r\npower insignificant.\r\n\r\nSo, after a long haggle between the party leaders as to the number and\r\nnature of the posts each party was to have, there followed another\r\nhard fight as to the persons each party should nominate for their\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nIt would have required a strong Government to reconstitute the German\r\npolity, reconstruct society, restore solvency, and revive economic\r\nvitality, especially after so much of the momentum of the revolution\r\nhad been lost. And the men who had come to the top in the old\r\nReichstag days were not such as to compensate for want of power in the\r\nmachine. The new President, Ebert, the saddler of Heidelberg, had\r\neffaced himself during the storm of the revolution and has apparently\r\nbeen eliminated altogether by his new responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Premier, Scheidemann, on the other hand, showed himself to be an\r\nable and active politician who could speak well on any subject and\r\nsing many songs without book. A clever man, but not the compelling\r\npersonality to control the dynamic forces of Socialism or to coerce\r\nthe static forces of Separatism.\r\n\r\nHis second in command in the difficult task of making a working\r\nConstitution was Preuss, the Minister of the Interior, a Jew, a\r\njurist, and an adjuster. A man with great finesse, but little force.\r\nThe questions of the constitutional future of Prussia, of the South\r\nGerman States, of the North-Western Republics, of the Rhine province,\r\nand of German-Austria, treated by adjustment along a line of least\r\nresistance, seemed likely to be interminable in their intricacies. Dr.\r\nPreuss, clever as he was, soon got into a terrible tangle trying to\r\nuntie knots that would have been cut by the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe post third in importance, Foreign Affairs, a non-party\r\nappointment, was retained by Count Brockdorff-Rantzau--no longer \"Dr.\r\nRantzau\"--since Counts, as he told the Assembly, can be democratic. He\r\nhad both character and capacity, and if he achieved no success either\r\nat Weimar or Versailles he behaved with dignity under most distressing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining Ministers Landsberg at Justice, a red Jew from the\r\nprovince of Posen, who was one of the Provisional Government and\r\npreviously a People's Commissary, had a singular and somewhat sinister\r\nreputation. He was held responsible by those who knew for the policy\r\nof breaking with the Poles and with Spartacus.\r\n\r\nBauer at Labour was a trade union politician, a bourgeois turned\r\nbureaucrat. He is now Premier in the Government that signed the peace.\r\n\r\nNoske at Home Defence (not \"War,\" mark you, Germany has had enough of\r\nwar), is the well-known Prussian Minister, the \"Saviour of Society,\"\r\nthe _Bolsheviktonos_.\r\n\r\nWissel at National Economy had a post with possibilities, but nothing\r\nso much became him in it as the leaving of it--when he found nothing\r\ncould be done.\r\n\r\nThese were all Social-Democrats and constituted such driving force as\r\nthat Government had. The inner Cabinet consisted of Landsberg, Noske,\r\nand Scheidemann--brain, backbone, and jaw. Heart it had none.\r\n\r\nThe new Government was, then, a Coalition between pre-revolution\r\npoliticians, and its programme had to be a compromise between\r\npre-revolution policies. It was only a Government to tide over a\r\ncrisis and give the country time to recover itself. But it was at\r\nleast composed of experienced parliamentarians who kept up appearances\r\nand did their best to reconstruct with pen and ink the State that\r\nBismarck had wrought with blood and iron.\r\n\r\nThe debate that followed the announcement of the new Government showed\r\nclearly enough that the three parties of which the Government was\r\ncomposed, though they parliamentarily formed a bloc and socially\r\nrepresented the Burgerstand, yet politically had a different basis and\r\na divergent bias. Red, white, and black make a very effective national\r\ncolour, but whether red Socialism, a colourless Liberalism, and black\r\nClericalism can make up an effective Cabinet seemed more than dubious.\r\n\r\nScheidemann, as Premier, opened the debate with a fighting speech for\r\nSocial-Democracy. He threw the responsibility for the misfortunes\r\nabroad on the Right, the responsibility for misunderstandings at home\r\non the Left, and proclaimed that the Government would work\r\nmethodically at realising the results of the revolution.\r\n\r\nHe was followed for the Centrum by the venerable Groeber, who preached\r\na sermon to the effect that all Power was from on High, that the\r\nrevolution came very much from below, and consequently the only things\r\nleft of any importance were State rights, rights of property, and the\r\nChurch of Rome.\r\n\r\nThereafter came Dr. Naumann, for the Democrats, with an eloquent\r\nfuneral oration, in which he buried the monarchy, wept over the lost\r\ncolonies and provinces, and prayed that all of Germany that was left\r\nmight live in unity.\r\n\r\nHere we have the three points of view--the Radical reconstructionist,\r\nthe Clerical reactionary, and the Liberal rhetorical--red, black, and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nAnd the Government's programme presented the same parti-coloured\r\npatchwork. In foreign policy: an early peace on Wilsonian principles,\r\nrestoration of the colonies and prisoners, equal participation in a\r\nLeague of Nations with mutual disarmament, compulsory arbitration and\r\nno secret diplomacy. In internal policy: democratic administration,\r\nditto education and army, economic reconstruction, rationing, public\r\ncontrol of monopolies, especially mines and power, right of\r\nassociation and wage boards, public health, rights for civil servants,\r\nagricultural development and settlement preferably on reclaimed land,\r\ntaxation of war profits, income-tax, death duties graduated but not\r\nconfiscatory, freedom of conscience, freedom of the Press, freedom of\r\nmeeting--all sorts of freedom.\r\n\r\nObviously, there was nothing very red or revolutionary there, or\r\nrather the red was so cautiously peppered into the black and white\r\nthat the net result was a colourless Liberalism. It was perhaps no\r\nless symbolic that the Assembly substituted the black, red and yellow\r\nof the Frankfort Liberalism of '48 as the new national colours. German\r\nLiberalism has always had a yellow streak in it.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Weimar is the failure of German Liberalism. German\r\nLiberalism always has failed Germany, and to this may be attributed the\r\nperiodic catastrophes of Germany and the calamities they have brought\r\nupon Europe. German Liberalism fell an easy prey to French Imperialism\r\nin the Napoleonic epoch and to Prussian Imperialism in the Bismarckian\r\nepoch; and the one result of German Liberal movements has hitherto been\r\nto drive abroad the flower of the German \"intelligentsia.\" The\r\ndescendants of the \"forty-niners\" in England and America have been as\r\nvaluable an element as were the Huguenots of France or the Flemings from\r\nthe Netherlands, and they have joined heartily with us in overthrowing\r\nthe despotism that exiled them. But if they had been a bit tougher and\r\nhad fought their own fight out a half century ago they would have saved\r\nEurope and Germany the last five years. And the process is repeating\r\nitself. Weimar has failed, so far, more miserably than did Frankfort a\r\nhalf century ago. The failure of Frankfort was the failure of political\r\ninexperience--that of Weimar has been the failure of political\r\nimpotence. Frankfort was over-confident in this power of popular\r\nidealism. It thought a revolution for right and reason could be made by\r\nrighteousness and reasoning. Weimar was too cynical to think that the\r\nideals of the November revolution could ever be a power at all in the\r\nEurope of the Paris Conference and of the Russian campaigns. Frankfort\r\nfailed because its Liberalism was too young. Weimar is failing because\r\nits Liberalism is too old.\r\n\r\nGerman Liberalism and its institution parliamentary party government\r\nfailed in the first place because they could not come to power before\r\ntheir day was already past. In the second place they failed because\r\nwhen their ideals did get realised they did so without opposition and\r\nconsequently on too theoretic lines. The German system of proportional\r\nrepresentation for example is the most accurately and equitably\r\nrepresentative of all electoral systems. But it did not provide the\r\none thing Germany wanted, a powerful and popular Government, and it\r\ndid a fatal injury to Germany by helping to split the Socialist party.\r\nThirdly German Liberals failed because their leaders were men grown\r\nmiddle-aged and muddle-headed in hopeless opposition. They had\r\nconsequently neither the energy nor the experience for popular\r\nleadership. And fourthly they failed because the peculiar combination\r\nof nationalism and internationalism that constitutes Liberalism was\r\ndeprived of all prestige with the German people by the policy followed\r\nat Paris. This policy made it almost impossible for a German to hold\r\nany middle position between extreme nationalism and extreme\r\ninternationalism. Weimar lost its best chance of acceptance when the\r\nGerman parliamentary State was excluded from the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Weimar and German Liberalism had everything in its favour in\r\nthe autumn of 1918. The reactionary factors that had so little\r\ndifficulty in stultifying the Liberalism of Bethmann-Hollweg, von\r\nKuehlmann, and their predecessors were cancelled for the time being.\r\nParliamentary government on the party system, the form of government\r\ndeveloped by Liberalism on the English model, never having had a trial\r\nin Germany was accepted by nearly all political minds as the panacea.\r\nThe minority of extremists who already advocated Council Government on\r\nthe Russian model as the only political system that could realise the\r\nrevolution had not as yet converted any large body of workmen. The\r\nTrades Unions held the workmen to the parliamentary system, and only\r\nsome of the soldiers and most of the sailors were really\r\nrevolutionary. The idea that the Soldiers' and Workmen's Councils\r\ncould be anything more than a mere improvisation for destruction and\r\ncould have any constructive, still more constitutional, function never\r\nentered the heads of any political thinker. Even Liebknecht joined the\r\nCoalition Provisional Government and only withdrew on second thoughts\r\nthat were probably those of the much more far-sighted Rosa Luxemburg.\r\nThe surrender of their authority by the Peoples' Commissaries to the\r\nConstituent Assembly in December was received without criticism, and\r\nthe subsequent similar surrender by the Central Council passed almost\r\nwithout comment. Germany was to have the most liberal of constitutions\r\nand that was to be enough for the realisation of the German revolution\r\nand for the reconciliation of the enemies of Germany. It was only as\r\nthe weeks and months passed and it became evident that German\r\nLiberalism, whether expressed in the diplomatic ideals or the\r\ndemocratic institutions of Weimar, was doing nothing either for the\r\nrevolution or the reconciliation, that the German workmen began to\r\npass over to the revolutionaries. Then, before very long, this\r\npolitical process expressed itself in local strikes and street\r\nfighting. The centre of political disturbance and development moved\r\naway from the theatre at Weimar to the streets of Berlin and of the\r\nindustrial towns.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was good policy in one way to transfer the Constituent\r\nAssembly to Weimar. An Assembly whose vitality is that of an elderly\r\npolitician after a contested election and whose voice is that of a\r\ntired lawyer talking in his sleep, could not make itself heard, still\r\nless felt, against the violence, and volleyings of modern Berlin.\r\nWhether its work will be worth much must depend on how slow things\r\nmove. They could easily move too fast for the pace of the Assembly.\r\nBut at least as Dr. Preuss said to me of his Constitution--\"it will\r\nnot get in the way of anything better.\" One thing was certain, that\r\nthe Assembly rested for its sanction, even for its survival, on the\r\nGovernment, not the Government on the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAnd listening to a deputy in the Tribune reading a treatise on\r\nConstitutional niceties as to federation and free-state-rights, I\r\nthink of the previous afternoon, when I was listening to a street\r\norator in Halle shouting very nasty and unconstitutional tirades about\r\nfood and freedom to an armed party of soldiers and workmen about to\r\nattack the Government troops. And then, again, I think of an afternoon\r\nin the Weimar Theatre a quarter of a century ago. A prominent member\r\nof the stock company of these days was an old horse blind of one\r\neye--who was always led on with his blind side to the footlights. On\r\nthis occasion he got turned round, and realised for the first time\r\nwhat a fool they'd made of him for years--and the rest was chaos and\r\nthe curtain.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly has determined the Constitutional future of\r\nGermany, but the fate of Germany has not been decided there. The\r\nstruggle between revolution and repression has not been fought out\r\nbetween the stalls and the stage of the Weimar Theatre, but in Berlin\r\nand the other big towns where the Government speaks with minenwerfer\r\nand machine-guns, and the Opposition obstruct with barricades. While\r\nthe pressure of general strikes and local street fighting has won a\r\nconstitutional recognition for socialising property and for\r\nsanctioning the council system never contemplated by the most\r\nrevolutionary Parliamentarians, on the other hand class war has given\r\nreaction the support of the whole country against the working class.\r\n\r\nThe stagnant stodgy atmosphere of Weimar was very different from the\r\nstarved and struggling air of Berlin. Though at first sight Berlin did\r\nnot seem any more alive than Weimar. For Berlin to-day is a town of\r\ndeserted temples and of dethroned gods. All along Unter den\r\nLinden--from the Temples of Mammon--the great hotels, to the Temple of\r\nMoloch--the imperial palace--everywhere is decay and dilapidation, an\r\nabomination of desolation in every facade and on every face. Mammon\r\nhas indeed come off better than Moloch; for the palace and public\r\nbuildings are shattered with shell and starred with shots and the\r\nbalcony where the War-Lord appeared to his worshippers has a hole in\r\nthe middle. Whereas the shrines of Mammon are full of worshippers from\r\nall quarters of the world. The hotel lobbies are crowded with\r\nvulture-like profiles brooding over the carcase of German economic\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nYet Berlin, though dirty and dilapidated, is by no means dead but the\r\ncentre of the conflict between two faiths--two religions. For the\r\nrevolution has ended the foreign war only to begin a civil war between\r\nnationalists and internationalists. On the one side, the Old Believers\r\nin the Orthodox Faith of nationalism, founded on wars of liberation,\r\nfomented by generations of political propaganda and excited to\r\nfanaticism by a war against the world. On the other side the new\r\nDissenters of the revolution preaching internationalism and a Commune\r\nof Heaven in which only the poor shall have a place. In December\r\ninternationalism was dominant in Berlin; nationalism was developing\r\nunder pressures from Paris; while imperialism was dormant. For at this\r\ntime in Paris the internationalism of Wilsonian principles was still\r\ncounterbalancing imperialist and nationalist policies of the Allies.\r\nIt was curious to note as the issues at Paris were decided one by one\r\nagainst internationalism how nationalism ousted internationalism from\r\ncontrol of policy in Germany. By the time the Treaty of Versailles was\r\npublished the old orthodox factor was again firmly established and the\r\ndissenters--the revolutionary internationalists--had been driven into\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nAny Sunday morning in Berlin during the sessions of the Paris\r\nConference would probably have given more than one opportunity of\r\nobserving the revival of the only real religion existing in modern\r\ncapital cities--nationalism. On one Sunday I have in mind there were\r\nseveral protest meetings against the proposals reported from Paris for\r\npartitioning off German populations in the Saar district, West\r\nPrussia, Danzig, German Bohemia, and the Tyrol, and for preventing the\r\nunion of German-Austria. For instance, you might have gone to the\r\nSport-Palast with Erzberger in the pulpit. I myself did not. The\r\nrotund, rubicund, ebullient, emollient Erzberger, ex-Minister of\r\nPropaganda and delegate to Spa, who looks like Winston Churchill\r\nturned Papal Legate, was too ritualistic for me. I went to a \"service\"\r\nat the Circus Busch, where the sermon was broader.\r\n\r\nCome with me then along Unter den Linden past the gilt crosses and\r\ncupolas of the Evangelical Dom and the shell-shattered sham classic\r\nfacade of the Imperial Palace--deserted shrines of the faith--to a\r\nvery dilapidated and dingy circus. There was a time when the\r\nProtestants of Germany were driven into the depths of the woods and\r\nthe dens of wild beasts to hold their services. And to-day we find the\r\npastors of protestant nationalism symbolically perched on pasteboard\r\nrocks amid woodland scenery, with a very realistic atmosphere of\r\nmenagerie. The congregation is characteristically middle-class and by\r\nno means so formidable in appearance as the hungry, haggard workmen\r\nand their women that we should have found in a meeting of the\r\ndissenting internationalists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we come in Freiherr von Richthofen is perorating a sort of\r\ncommination service, each verse of which is received with a loud\r\nresponse. The Paris Conference is worse than the Congress of Vienna\r\n(ah). France is outraging and robbing Germany when wounded and a\r\nprisoner (aah). But not a yard of German soil shall be surrendered\r\nwithout consent of its population (aaah). Germany can be dissected\r\nalive, but England will be disgraced and America dishonoured (aaah),\r\nand a time will come when such outrages will find their retribution\r\n(AAAH). A roar of applause which rouses the wild beasts in their dens,\r\nso that they roar in unison. The Paris diplomats have at last\r\nsucceeded in stirring up again the weary wolves of war where they were\r\nlying licking their wounds.\r\n\r\nBut then, like a thin trickle of cold water into a boiling pot, comes\r\nthe aged, anxious voice of the patriarchal Bernstein. He begins by\r\nreading the resolution of the Berne Conference; but we are here to\r\nattack the Paris Conference, and get restless, shouting \"Zur Sache\"\r\n(come to the point). He speaks of the fair-mindedness of the British\r\ndelegates there, trade unionists as well as independents, and\r\nconcludes that England as a people wishes to be fair to Germany; this\r\ncan even be seen in developments at Paris. But we don't share this\r\noptimism--_Bloedsinn_ (bosh), is about the mildest of our\r\ninterjections. Still Bernstein, nothing daunted, maintains that if\r\nGermans bring facts before the English the English will be fair.\r\n\"Quite true,\" shouts an elderly man near by. \"What do you know about\r\nit?\" cries a youth some rows away. \"I have been longer in England than\r\nyou have in the world, _Lausbub_,\" retorts the man.\r\n\r\nBernstein again becomes audible, talking about Alsace-Lorraine. Once\r\nwe might have appealed to foreign fairness there, too, he says, but\r\nnow it is too late. Alsace-Lorraine is lost, and we lost it. This is\r\ntoo much for us, and we shout: \"But you're speaking for partition.\r\n_Quatsch!_ (bosh). _Parteibulle!_ (party claptrap), etc.\" Bernstein\r\ndominates the storm enough to shout: \"You have been so long fed on\r\nlies you can't swallow the truth.\" But we are not here to have truth\r\nshoved down our throats.\r\n\r\nEduard Bernstein withdraws--a prophet without honour, he has this week\r\nboth left the opposition party and lost his Government post. He is\r\nfollowed by the representative of German-Austria, the new type of\r\nprofessor-politician, with a Victorian appearance and a Wilsonian\r\naddress--very earnest and emphatic. The union of Germany and\r\nGerman-Austria is, he maintains, an internal affair and quite\r\ninevitable. We give Professor Hartmann a rousing reception, and file\r\nout into the cold, clear winter weather of Berlin.\r\n\r\nOutside is a large black, red, and gold Republican flag, and a number\r\nof enthusiasts carrying placards, \"No partitioning of Germany,\" \"No\r\npeace of violence,\" and so forth. A long procession forms and moves\r\noff. Look at that group, mostly elderly men and women of the middle\r\nclass, thin and threadbare with the look given by hardship and hunger\r\nthat once in Germany one saw only in paintings of the Middle\r\nAges--dull faces, but not without devotional fervour. So they shuffle\r\nalong round a placard inscribed \"Wilson's Fourteen Points,\" as their\r\nancestors once shuffled in procession for Luther's theses. Unhappily\r\nWilson did not succeed in nailing his theses to the portals of the\r\nQuai d'Orsay.\r\n\r\nWe reach the Wilhelmstrasse, where we join the processions from the\r\nother meetings. All learn with gratification that the Sport-Palast has\r\nhooted Erzberger because he won't declare for a restoration of Posen\r\nto Germany, and that the officers' meeting passed a resolution calling\r\nfor the exclusion from the peace delegation of the internationalist\r\nProfessor Schuecking. The procession from the officers' meeting is\r\nheaded by a band playing \"Deutschland ueber alles,\" and by the old\r\nblack, white, and red national flag, which is fast becoming the\r\nstandard of reaction. After the Finance Minister, Schiffer, has\r\nwelcomed our quite unobjectionable resolution from a balcony of the\r\nReichskanzlei, a young officer suddenly appears in another balcony\r\nwaving a black, white, and red flag, and adjuring us to swear loyalty\r\nto it. We are prepared to swear anything by now without much bothering\r\nwhat it is, and find ourselves being moved along towards the\r\nTiergarten.\r\n\r\nAs we pass the British Embassy suddenly the officers' procession\r\nbegins to shout and wave to a flabby-faced portly person bowing and\r\nsmiling on the kerb. Ludendorff! By the undying jingo! Well! what\r\nnext? Then to Bismarck's statue, where officers offer tributes of\r\nrhetoric and wreaths, and finally a schoolboy, climbing the pedestal,\r\ncalls for cheers for the Kaiser, while a claque below start up \"Heil\r\nDir im Siegerkranz.\" But this is a bit too much for the bystanders.\r\n\"Where's your Kaiser? Where's your Victory?\" shouts one. \"You give us\r\nthe Kaiser,\" growls a soldier behind me, \"and we'll give him a wreath\r\nall right--round his neck, and pulled tight.\"\r\n\r\nThe German dynasties exploited Luther and his Protestant movement. I\r\ndoubt they will succeed in exploiting the national protestants of\r\nGermany, who are revolting against the infallible imbecilities of\r\ndiplomacy. But undoubtedly our demagogues and diplomatists have\r\nsucceeded in setting up again the idols our soldiers and sailors had\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nThe scene described above took place in March and then it was already\r\nbecoming difficult to see the other side of Berlin political life--the\r\ninternationalist and revolutionary. Reaction had begun to drive\r\nrevolution underground and revolution was resisting spasmodically in\r\neruptions and explosions. Let us take another day in March, one during\r\nthe street fighting, to see what this other side of life in Berlin was\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the life that filled the public places of Berlin was as\r\nvivid and vivacious as it was vulgar and vicious. Unter den Linden was\r\nlike a scene in a second-rate revue; the company in one of the rococo\r\nrestaurants was like the food, exuberant and cheap, but neither\r\ninteresting nor choice. Nowhere were nouveaux riches so obviously new\r\nand so obtrusively rich. Everything was bright and loud, everyone\r\nlooked overfed and over-dressed. Materially there was a sort of\r\nred-faced, raucous-voiced rotundity about Berlin. Morally it was in a\r\ndecadence like that of the Second Empire at Paris when a charlatan\r\ndespot and a cheap-jack Government were trying to dazzle the eyes and\r\ndistract the ears of a half-deluded public.\r\n\r\nBut now, after four years' war, Berlin is like an Empire Exhibition\r\nthat has been deserted and decaying through the storms of four\r\nwinters. The stucco ornaments have fallen, the gilding is long gone,\r\nand the whole structure is rotting away.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the first impression you get is that both city and people are\r\ndying of a decline. The people, like their houses, are dirty and\r\ndingy; everywhere crippled beggars and ruined or unroofed buildings\r\nshow the direct effects of war. Clothes are threadbare, faces thin.\r\nStalwart, straight-backed Americans, warmly clothed and well fed,\r\nstand out like solid shapes among shadows. As they stride through the\r\nstreets you expect to see them pass through these grey, drifting\r\nfigures as through ghosts.\r\n\r\nYet there is life still in Berlin, for men must be alive who can face\r\ndeath for a cause, whether it be for law or for liberty. But you must\r\ngo further afield to find it than Unter den Linden where are haunting\r\nonly ghosts of the past. We are hunting the genius of the future.\r\n\r\nWe shall be out all day on this hunt, and had better breakfast on\r\nbully beef and biscuit--a present from American friends--for black\r\nbread and substitutes are no foundation for a long walk; and of the\r\nvast transportation system of underground and overhead trains,\r\nelectric trams, motor-buses, and taxis that used to carry over three\r\nmillion passengers daily, little indeed is now left. Moreover the\r\nwretched remains are to-day tied up by the general strike and street\r\nfighting. And so, avoiding the streets where sniping is in progress or\r\nbarb-wire barricades threaten a search for arms and inspection for\r\npasses, we come to the General Assembly of Berlin Councils--that for\r\nthe moment alone retains political control of the situation, since the\r\nGovernment took military command of it by the severest form of martial\r\nlaw and the general use of machine-guns.\r\n\r\nHere we find a large music hall which before the war was a typical\r\nscene of flamboyant Berlin night-life. On this grey winter's morning\r\nit is crammed full of grimly earnest men--the delegates. On the stage\r\nis the Executive Council. The chairman the Independent, Richard\r\nMueller, is of the pastor or professor type--his colleague Daeumig a\r\nheavily built, grey-haired man, might be an English engineer or\r\nmerchant captain. On the left of the hall are the Communists, in the\r\nmiddle the Independents, and on the right the Social-Democrats, with a\r\nlittle knot of Democrats--the two latter parties supporters of the\r\nGovernment and opposers of the strike--but in a minority here. The\r\nbusiness before the Assembly is the filling of the vacancies on the\r\nExecutive Council left by the Communists who seceded from it when it\r\ndeclared the strike off, and the appointing of delegates to the\r\nNational Congress of Councils which is to meet next month. But the\r\nCommunists intend to force a discussion of the Government's policy as\r\nto the street fighting which is still going on at Lichtenberg, and the\r\nchairman has to concede this.\r\n\r\nFirst come forward representatives of the Councils' Commissions\r\ndelegated to investigate the stories of cruelties by the insurgents\r\nand to negotiate a cessation of hostilities between them and the\r\ngovernment commanders. They give their reports in impartial and\r\nunimpassioned language, but indicate their impression that the\r\nmilitary authorities they had to deal with were less concerned to\r\nrestore order with as little loss of life and of time as possible,\r\nthan to create the impression that the disorder was worse than it\r\nreally was. They were exploiting a local \"putsch\" so as to carry out a\r\ngeneral \"pogrom.\"\r\n\r\nThe first speaker, Richard Mueller, for the Independents, deplores the\r\ndisorder, but denounces the Government for instructing its troops to\r\nshoot everyone found with arms, in reprisal for atrocities invented by\r\nits own secret service. The defence of the Government is undertaken\r\nby a Social-Democrat, who declares the Independents responsible for\r\nthe disorders, amid stormy interruptions from the Communists. The\r\nchairman can hardly get him a hearing, and he leaves the stage,\r\nindignantly threatening that his party will secede unless it is better\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nNext dashes on to the stage the Communist leader, who delivers an\r\neffective indictment of the Government's proceedings--at first\r\ninterrupted by angry interjections from the Right. But as he develops\r\nthe tragedy of what is going on outside, gives one name after another\r\nof comrades shot on no more than suspicion and describes the ring of\r\nhowitzers firing into the crowded tenements of Lichtenberg, a silence\r\nfalls over the meeting, and at last expressions of disapproval and\r\ndissociation come from supporters of the Government. For here is an\r\nAssembly that is alive enough, and though organised in parties, yet\r\nstill open to the appeal of facts and to the force of arguments.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, the speaker stops, leaps\r\nfrom the desk, and dashes off the stage at the back--while a confused\r\nuproar breaks out at the back of the hall, dominated by sharp military\r\norders. The whole Assembly comes to its feet and faces about. The Left\r\nshout and shake fists at a row of steel-helmeted soldiers, with\r\nloaded rifles at the ready and a minatory machine-gun. The Right wave\r\nhands and shrug shoulders to assure the Left they are not accomplices.\r\nThe platform proclaims that the proceedings will continue. A Democrat\r\nis put up to speak, but even his mind, conscious of right, and his\r\ncourageous determination to express equal disapproval with the Left as\r\nto the entry of the troops are not enough to overcome the mesmerism of\r\nthat machine-gun. The Assembly for the moment is reunited, but its\r\nvitality is gone.\r\n\r\nWe have been present at the first scene of the forcible suppression of\r\nthe Councils movement in its constitutional centre--a suppression that\r\nhas since become continuous.\r\n\r\nThe next covert we have to draw in our hunt is a club of intellectuals,\r\nmostly Independents, meeting weekly at a private house. Berlin never had\r\na club life, and this is only an embryo of a political club before it\r\nemerges from a social gathering. The members sit round in a great ring,\r\nsometimes all joining in a general debate, sometimes breaking up into\r\nsmall discussions. They are of all types and tendencies. The well-bred,\r\nwell-dressed man with a Balliol manner is a Rhodes Scholar and a\r\nsuccessful diplomatist of ultra-radical views--for such an anomaly is\r\npossible under Count Brockdorff-Rantzau. The soldier in faded field grey\r\ndescribing a scheme for educating workman members of Councils in their\r\nduties, is a Communist. The diplomat is maintaining that Germany should\r\njoin the League of Nations, even if it and the peace conditions are\r\nunsatisfactory. The worse the material position of Germany the better\r\nits moral position for taking the lead in a revision of the peace and of\r\nthe League. The Communist brushes this aside as sophistry. How can you\r\nfound internationalism on national Governments or even on national\r\nParliaments? Wilsonism and Weimarism are both out of date and off the\r\nmark. An international Soviet of washerwomen would be of more real value\r\nand vitality. He is interrupted by cheers greeting the arrival of a\r\nfamous fighting flying man, who was believed to have been one of the\r\ntwelve hundred arrests of opposition leaders. An early Victorian\r\nmiddle-aged man in side whiskers and a frock coat, an ex-Minister in\r\ntouch with the Government, begins to explain the necessity of\r\nreconstructing the Cabinet by eliminating the men most compromised by\r\nthe loss of life, and including new men from the Left. He considers that\r\nwhile opinion is moving to the Left the Government is moving to the\r\nRight, and that as the breach widens the outbreaks will get worse. He\r\nfears, however, that men who have grown old in opposition and have only\r\njust tasted power will not be torn away from it and will find it simple\r\nto govern by machine-guns. But the young men are not interested in the\r\nCabinet--they drift off into discussing their schemes for the Councils.\r\n\r\nHere, too, is life--the life radiated by young men who feel that power\r\nis coming to them before youth has gone, the life reflected from\r\nmiddle-aged men who have broken the dull crust in which circumstance\r\nwas encasing them.\r\n\r\nWhen this club was suppressed shortly after, Berlin could ill afford\r\nthe loss of vitality. For the absence of all healthy, happy and\r\nyouthful faces made it like a world of gnomes and goblins. In the case\r\nof the men this was mainly owing to the war, and in the case of the\r\nwomen and children to the blockade. Over a million of the fittest men\r\nhad been killed, and the result was a survival of all the unfit; while\r\nthe food and fuel hardships had fallen heaviest on the women and\r\nchildren of the towns.\r\n\r\nBut there was another reason for the disappearance of all young men\r\nthat had youth and manliness. Their warfare was not yet accomplished,\r\nand they had only come back from fighting the whole world on three\r\nfronts for four years to fight against each other in the streets of\r\ntheir capital cities. They went to war against the world for two\r\nideals--patriotism and progress; and now these two ideals had\r\nthemselves collided in civil war.\r\n\r\nOf the two German ideals, that of patriotism is the one we know best.\r\nThat dull devotion and forced fervour that fights in massed formations\r\nto sentimental songs. It is a form of patriotism that does not appeal\r\nto us. To Athens Sparta is anti-pathetic. But there were fine fellows\r\namong the Spartans as well as tyrants and helots, and now that the\r\ntyrants are gone such as are left of the fine fellows have a chance of\r\nrealising their Spartan ideals. Now that those trumpery tinsel\r\ntyrants, the Kaiser and his courtier generals, have retired to\r\nscribble and squabble and scuffle over dirty linen--a Valhalla of\r\nwasherwomen--the men of the real Spartan breed, who carried the German\r\narms from conquest to conquest until the catastrophe was complete, are\r\nworking hard to restore ideals shattered by rout and revolution.\r\n\r\nOf the real fine fellows that I've met in Germany half were officers\r\nand men who had responded to the various appeals for home defence and\r\nwho were working to revive the old Spartan tradition in the\r\nwar-wearied youth.\r\n\r\nHere are two notices from the advertisement columns of the _Lokal\r\nAnzeiger_, which seem to me to contrast the real Spartan and the\r\nJunker:\r\n\r\n\"To all old soldiers of the Prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau Fifth\r\nPomeranian Infantry Regt., No. 42. Regimental Comrades! From day to\r\nday the impudence of the Poles increases. From day to day they seize\r\nmore German land and more German food. From day to day they come\r\nnearer to--they claim more of--our Old Pomerania. All you brave old\r\n42nd who ever undefeated have defended German soil against more\r\nformidable foes, rejoin your beloved regiment to defend your homes\r\nagainst the ungrateful Poles to liberate whom so many of your comrades\r\ndied. Report to Headquarters, Stralsund. Conditions of service are\r\npay, allowances, etc., as on active service with 5 mks. extra daily,\r\nand a fortnight's notice. Obedience required to military regulations\r\nand to those in authority, with whom are associated councils of\r\ndelegates. Signed F----, member of Soldiers' Council, First Lieut.\r\nK----Regimental Commandant.\"\r\n\r\nNote the signature of the representative of the Soldaten-Rat preceding\r\nthat of the Commandant.\r\n\r\nIn those days even Frei-Corps recruited in this manner had their\r\nSoldiers' Councils. And it was the remains of this Council\r\norganisation that prevented these Corps from being used to overthrow\r\nthe Republic in the _coup-d'etat_ planned when the treaty was signed.\r\n\r\nCompare now the appeal of the Junker--a _Vortanzer_ no doubt at many a\r\nCourt Ball and a flunkey still.\r\n\r\n\"Officer of elegant appearance and engaging manners with experience of\r\npolite society, seeks employment. Would undertake to supervise\r\nrestaurant.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, as a result of class war, the students, hitherto always the\r\nYoung Guard of revolution in Germany, have this time taken sides with\r\nwhat may well be called reaction. In the various volunteer corps--the\r\n\"Noske Guards\"--that are used for fighting the revolutionary troops\r\nand the workmen, the largest and best elements are young ex-officers\r\nor N.C.O.'s and students.\r\n\r\nI remember when a workmen's meeting was broken up by a picket of the\r\nReinhard Corps noting that the privates almost all wore pince-nez. The\r\nworkmen called them mercenaries and murderers, but it was absurd to\r\naccuse fine young men who looked like Balliol, with a leaven of Blues\r\nand Bloods, of selling themselves for eight shillings a day and extra\r\nrations. These Spartans and their ideals will be heard of again\r\nunless Germany is given a square deal and a fair field.\r\n\r\nAnd the other half of the fine fellows I've met in Germany were\r\nSpartacists--fighters for the ideal of progress. For this ideal has\r\nhad in Germany as many devotees as the other. No country had so large\r\na radical and revolutionary political element as Germany before the\r\nwar. In no country did the economics and politics of Socialism occupy\r\nso many minds. Sovietism is only a rough Russian realisation of German\r\nideals. The rebellion under Spartacus of revolted gladiators and\r\nescaped slaves, which challenged for years the imperialism and\r\nmilitarism of Rome, does give some idea of what these men are and what\r\ntheir cause is.\r\n\r\nThe handsomest and most intelligent man I've met in Germany was a\r\nSpartacist, a film actor by profession. The last time I saw him--with\r\na rifle slung over his shoulder and stick bombs in his belt--he\r\nexplained what he was fighting for. German militarism, he said, had\r\nrevived, encouraged by the Entente attitude; the present Government\r\nwas as much in the hands of reactionary officers as any during the\r\nwar. The war had crippled militarism, but only real revolution, the\r\ncouncil system, could kill it. He was glad he had escaped the war, so\r\nas to have a life to offer to the right side. The next day he was\r\ntaken and shot.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not intend to convey that the Germany of to-day is a\r\nfighting country. It is quite the reverse. But a section of idealists\r\nat each extreme has decided that they are bound to die for their\r\nideals as Spartans or Spartacists. That they will die in vain is\r\ninevitable. If only because there is no Sparta and no Spartacus. There\r\nis no German land where such an ideal as that of the reactionary\r\n\"Spartans\" can now be realised, not even in rural Prussia; and there\r\nis no Spartacus to command and control the \"Spartakists\" of Germany.\r\nBut there is another reason also--that there are too few young Germans\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday morning I went to the Academy of Singing to hear old\r\nGerman music. One number on the programme, \"A Scottish Ballad of a\r\nLost Battle,\" proved to be a translation of Lady Lindsay's \"Lament\r\nAfter Flodden.\" Sung to a plaintive eighteenth century air, with the\r\nthin far-away accompaniment of lute and spinet, it was like an echo\r\nfrom the lost battles and lost beauty of all time. With bowed heads\r\nand tear-filled eyes, men and women sat silent long after the last\r\nheartrending refrain had died away.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went out to the \"Greenwood\" of Berlin, a district\r\nof pine woods, hills, and lakes, where the young people of Berlin used\r\nto flock for picnics and water-parties. The Berliners are noisy in\r\ntheir enjoyments, and on Sunday afternoons before the war the woods of\r\nthe Havelland would ring with shouting and singing and laughter, with\r\nfeasting and flirting, as though Pan himself held festival.\r\n\r\nTo-day a few girls were there wandering sadly through the silent\r\nwoods, pale ghosts of dead delights, and there was no sound but the\r\nsighing of the pines--\r\n\r\n    \"Sair moaning in ilka green loaning,\r\n    The flowers o' the forest are a' wede awa'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL REPUBLICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first result of the failure of German Liberalism and of the Weimar\r\nAssembly was that revolution and reaction came into active collision\r\nwith each other in the provincial capitals.\r\n\r\nThese two conflicts ran concurrently, and collision in the provinces\r\nwas a necessary consequence of collision in the capital. Moreover,\r\nwhen the revolution had failed twice to assert itself by force in\r\nBerlin, it stood little chance of surviving in Bavaria, Brunswick, or\r\nBremen. Such spontaneous and sporadic appeals to force met by\r\norganised police measures and prosecutions only prevented the\r\nSocialist party from reuniting, and forced German politics into a duel\r\nbetween the propertied classes and the proletariat, in which the\r\nlatter had no prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThis duel started in Berlin in the December and January conflicts\r\nwhich were settled in favour of the Government, and its subsequent\r\ncontinuance in the provinces had the same result.\r\n\r\nThe outbreaks in the coast ports and the coal districts of Westphalia\r\nwere remote, and their unexpectedly easy repression by flying columns\r\nonly confirmed the Government in a policy of coercion. The outbreaks\r\nin Munich and the south were outside the political orbit in which the\r\nGovernment was moving. If the spread of the general strike from the\r\nwest to Saxony, which broke Germany in two and cut Berlin off from\r\nWeimar, was more serious, yet the Maerker column soon succeeded, in\r\nremoving any danger to Weimar and in reopening communications with\r\nBerlin. These outbreaks were not formidable enough to force the\r\nGovernment to depart from its policy of suppressing not only revolts,\r\nbut the revolution.\r\n\r\nBut the general strike and street fighting in Eastern Berlin during\r\nMarch although it was intentionally exaggerated so as to impress Paris\r\nwith the Bolshevist danger, did for a few days imperil not only the\r\nScheidemann Government, but the whole Parliamentary system. Both were\r\nconsequences of the coalition which by giving the Government a class\r\nbasis had made it quite incapable of going halfway to meet the\r\nrevolutionary demands for recognition of the Council System and for\r\nsocialisation. At first, party ties had held the moderate mass of the\r\nSocial-Democratic workmen; but as time passed and the middle-class\r\nmentality of the men in power became more and more marked,\r\ndissatisfaction with the Government and defections to the Opposition\r\ngrew rapidly. Even _Vorwaerts_ admitted there was cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nIn vain did the Government poster the streets with pathetic protests\r\nthat \"socialisation is already here,\" and issued manifestoes pointing\r\nto its legislative achievements--Eight-Hour Day, Unemployment Benefit,\r\nLand Settlement, what we should call \"Whitley Councils\" in coal-mining\r\ndistricts, War Pensions, and Repeal of War Measures. These had already\r\nbeen put in force provisionally by the previous Government, and did\r\nnot amount to much any way. In vain did the Government profess its\r\nintention of pushing through the two Bills approving, in principle,\r\nnationalisation of coal mines and potash deposits; for no one wanted\r\nnationalisation except as a step to socialisation. The workmen felt\r\nthat the Government was, as one put it to me, \"a revolution\r\nprofiteer.\" It had perverted the purposes and pocketed the profits of\r\nthe revolution. They felt that Weimar, as another one expressed it,\r\nwas only a \"soviet of profiteers\" and would produce no socialist\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary opponents of the Coalition saw their opportunity,\r\nbut their leaders could secure no combination or concerted action.\r\nNothing, indeed, was more surprising than the incapacity of the\r\nGermans to associate and organise for a political purpose.\r\n\r\nThe general impression one got was that Germany had so grown to look\r\non political responsibility as the function of a specialised class\r\nthat they never could consider anyone outside that class as capable of\r\nreplacing any member of it. We see something of the same sort of\r\nhelplessness growing up in England, where it is becoming increasingly\r\ndifficult for the man in the street to conceive a Cabinet formed from\r\noutside a small clique of the ruling class. And the German\r\nrevolutionaries of the Opposition showed themselves as incapable of\r\nmaking use of their opportunities as did their Liberal opponents in\r\nthe Government. The game was in the revolutionaries' hands in the\r\nearly months of the year if they could have combined. But the\r\ndifferent disturbed districts declared war on the Government at just\r\nsuch intervals of time as allowed them to be conveniently beaten in\r\ndetail by very small forces. Each district again was divided into all\r\nmanner of dissentient organisations in different stages of\r\ndevelopment. In some the Councils were really representative, in\r\nothers they had co-opted themselves; while there were as many kinds of\r\nrevolutionary corps as of Councils.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin alone there were some ten different corps. A leader of one\r\nof the last insurgent parties to hold out, told me, during an attack\r\nby the Government troops, that it was not the great disparity of\r\nnumbers and munitions that had defeated him, but the difficulty of\r\ngetting the revolutionaries to work together.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the issue between reaction and revolution in Berlin was\r\nfought out in two different and quite distinct conflicts, that were\r\ninvariably confused by the foreign Press. One took the form of strikes\r\nthe other of street fighting. The general strike was the resistance of\r\nthe Workmen's Council organisations to suppression by the middle-class\r\nMinistry. The street fighting was the resistance of the remains of the\r\nold revolutionary forces to suppression by the new Frei-Corps\r\n\"mercenaries\" of the reaction. The two developed concurrently though\r\nwith little connection.\r\n\r\nThe strikes that were always breaking out everywhere for no apparent\r\nreason culminated in the Berlin general strike of March. This general\r\nstrike was forced on the reluctant Majority Socialists by the\r\nIndependents, themselves propelled by the Communists. For these two\r\nlatter controlled the Executive Committee of the Berlin Councils. But\r\nthough the Majority Socialists did not oppose the general strike, they\r\ndid their best to make it a failure, and when, after three days, the\r\nCommunists pressed for its extension to water, gas, electricity, and\r\nfood supply in order to support the fighting Spartacists, the\r\nMajoritarians withdrew, and by the end of the week the strike was\r\ndeclared off. The Majority Socialists' proposal for unconditional\r\nsurrender was rejected, that of the Independents for surrender on\r\nconditions of amnesty accepted, and the conditions were agreed to by\r\nthe Government. Thereupon the Left of the Communists, including the\r\nbrilliant Clara Zetkin, took the opportunity of this crisis and of the\r\nparty caucus (Parteitag) then sitting in Berlin to secede to the\r\nSpartacists.\r\n\r\nThe loss of their Left wing was, however, more than compensated to the\r\nIndependents by the movement leftward in the ranks of the\r\nSocial-Democrats, the supporters of the Government. And this leftward\r\ntrend was accentuated by disapproval of the action of the Government\r\nin bombarding whole quarters of Berlin and in shooting wholesale its\r\npolitical opponents. This rapid response of the Council system to a\r\ntrend in public opinion was in strong contrast to the irresponsive\r\ninertia of the Weimar Assembly, which remained representative only of\r\na nationalist mood, and remote from the whole Socialist movement.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry had to give to the political pressure. Already before the\r\nstrike it indicated concessions as to industrial socialisation and\r\nconstitutional sanction of the Councils, and these were elaborated and\r\nestablished by negotiations at Weimar with missions sent from the\r\nCentral and Executive Councils. These concessions were in principle\r\nvery considerable, and much more than could ever have been imposed in\r\npractical application on the Centrum supporters of the Government. The\r\nresult of this crisis was therefore to prepare the way for a\r\nreconstruction of the Government on a moderate Socialist basis,\r\nbetween a Centrum-Conservative opposition to the Right and a Communist\r\nto the Left. This would have represented the true balance of political\r\npower at the time; and the fact that it would not have had a majority\r\nat Weimar would have been only a formal difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut this, the natural, solution was made impossible by the\r\nextraordinary severity with which the armed resistance to the\r\nGovernment was punished. For this severity made it impossible for\r\neven the most moderate Independents to join the Government. And this\r\nfighting was not a development of the strike, but of the campaign\r\ncarried on by the Government with volunteer flying columns against the\r\nrevolutionary corps throughout Germany.\r\n\r\nOf these corps, of which there were many in Berlin, the most important\r\nwere the Republican Guard and the Marine Division. The former had from\r\nthe first supported the Government, while the Marine Division of Kiel\r\nsailors had already been in collision with it in December. The other\r\ncorps were all more or less in opposition, and some were mere\r\ncamouflage for bad characters. Until these corps were dispersed the\r\nconstitutional Government had no complete control of Berlin apart from\r\ntheir \"Council\" rival, the Executive Committee. A first step was made\r\ntowards their suppression by the arrest of sixty ringleaders;\r\nwhereupon the Marine Division and the other corps prepared for\r\nresistance, with the assistance of the Spartacist irregulars and a\r\nrabble of roughs and rascals. These were joined later by about half\r\nthe Republican Guard, which had come into collision with the\r\nFrei-Corps--the Government volunteer contingents. The strikers,\r\nhowever, took no part in the fighting.\r\n\r\nThe strike was declared on a Monday; Tuesday passed in preparations by\r\nthe regulars and plunderings by the rabble, and on Wednesday the\r\ngarrisons of Government buildings in the east central district of\r\nBerlin were attacked and besieged. They were hard pressed, but held\r\nout, being supplied by aeroplane until relieved by an offensive of the\r\nGovernment's troops on Thursday afternoon. For some hours a tremendous\r\nbombardment was carried on round the Alexanderplatz and neighbouring\r\nstreets, but the damage to property though considerable could only\r\nhave been as little as it was if at least half the \"hows\" and\r\n\"minnies\" had been firing blank; for the benefit rather of the\r\ncorrespondents than of the insurgents. The insurgents' positions were\r\neventually made untenable by aeroplane observation and bombing. During\r\nthe following days they were driven, with terrific fusillades and some\r\nfighting, through the east end into the suburbs, where the\r\nbombardments were continued for no obvious reason for several days.\r\n\r\nBerlin will long remember those Ides of March. So shall I, not because\r\nof Thursday's fighting--you could generally get your fill of such\r\nfighting in Germany those days--but because on that Thursday I got a\r\nreal lunch. It was a good lunch--oysters, veal cutlets, and pancakes.\r\nIt was given me by a banker, and cost just about four shillings a\r\nmouthful. I know, because I counted them. And in the cellars of the\r\nsame house were families living on 5 lbs. of bad potatoes and 5 lbs.\r\nof black bread a week.\r\n\r\nThe banker and I were enemies, and I was nominally and nationally\r\nengaged in starving him; though, as members of our respective\r\nIndependent Labour Parties, we were politically working in the same\r\ncause. And a few streets away men of one race and one class were\r\nkilling each other respectively in the names of Law and Liberty. Such\r\nwas European civilisation in the year of Our Lord 1919.\r\n\r\nBut probably you are more interested in the fighting; so, if you like,\r\nI will take you two excursions through it. We will start the first on\r\nThursday afternoon, when the insurgent soldiers and Spartacists were\r\ntrying to force their way westward from their base in the east end,\r\nacross the Spree, past the Schloss, to the Linden, and the Government\r\ntroops were trying to drive them eastward. The main battleground was\r\nthe Alexanderplatz, from which radiate the main thoroughfares leading\r\neast.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the Linden all is much as usual. Instead of the\r\nomnibuses laid up by the general strike long German farm carts drawn\r\nby ponies are carrying passengers perched on planks resting on\r\npacking-cases. Lorries with mounted machine-guns patrol up and down,\r\nand machine-gun pickets guard all important buildings. As we go east\r\nthe roadway empties and the traffic on the pavements thickens into\r\nhesitating groups all facing eastward, or knots encircling some\r\npolitical discussion. Further on the roadway is blocked by artillery\r\nof the Luettwitz Volunteer Corps going into action--field-guns, trench\r\nmortars, and minenwerfer, the latter towed behind lorries loaded with\r\nthe missiles, great brown conical cylinders 4 ft. high. Here, too, is\r\nthe first cordon, and the game of \"passes\" begins.\r\n\r\nThe main rules are not to revoke by playing a pass from the wrong\r\nside, and not to put on a higher card than is necessary. I take this\r\ntrick with quite a low card, the Foreign Office pass. At the next\r\ncordon I try quite a good card--a pink Weimar Press pass with a\r\nphotograph, but he won't have it. I go one better with a British\r\npassport, Royal Arms and all, but he trumps this by shoving his rifle\r\nunder my nose and saying, \"Be off!\" I have still a special pass from\r\nthe Kommandantur, and, best of all, a visiting card with \"Noske\"\r\nscribbled on it, but the game is over here. These Government\r\nvolunteers, boys of eighteen or nineteen, shoot from the hip or\r\nanyhow, and are all on hair triggers.\r\n\r\nWe try round another way. A soldier with a rifle at the ready comes\r\ndown the middle of the empty street scanning the windows. \"Window\r\nshut,\" he shouts, aiming at one. A red poster proclaims that anyone\r\nloitering will be shot at. We are now in the danger zone. A lorry\r\nhurries forward, the bottom spread with brown stained mattresses. The\r\nnoise becomes bewildering--the _crack_ of roof snipers and the _rap_\r\nof the machine-guns are incessant. A field-gun is banging away round\r\nthe corner, and that heavy boom is a minenwerfer shelling the\r\nAlexanderplatz.\r\n\r\nThe main struggle has already passed into the roads radiating\r\neastward, which the insurgents are barricading hastily, while others\r\non tugs retreat south down the Spree. But of this fight we can only\r\nsee the aeroplanes swooping a few hundred feet over the roofs and\r\nbombing the machine-gun nests. An insurgent plane engages for a few\r\nminutes, but retires outnumbered. The battle is over; though fighting\r\nwill go on for days as the troops drive the insurgents from one street\r\nto another through the eastern quarter out into the suburbs.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is the following Tuesday, and I will take you for our\r\nsecond excursion into the insurgent camp at Lichtenberg--the most\r\neasterly suburb of Berlin, where the main body still holds out. This\r\nmorning's Government bulletin has told us that the victorious\r\nGovernment troops have cleared the whole East End, except Lichtenberg,\r\nwhich is encircled with a \"ring of steel.\" That several thousand\r\ninsurgents have barricaded all approaches and are sweeping them with\r\nfield-guns. That they have destroyed hundreds of tons of flour. That\r\nthey have shot sixty--a hundred--two hundred prisoners. That others\r\nhave been torn in pieces by the mob, which has taken wounded from the\r\nambulances and clubbed them to death. That no one in a decent coat can\r\nventure on the street without being murdered. That in consequence of\r\nthese \"bestial atrocities\" anyone found with arms will be shot. But\r\nwe've read war bulletins before!\r\n\r\nOn our way we pass a convoy of prisoners, hands handcuffed behind\r\ntheir backs, armed motor-cars before and behind. A young soldier\r\nblazes off several shots to scatter the crowd, at which a well-dressed\r\nwoman remonstrates, but she is at once arrested and put with the\r\nconvoy.\r\n\r\nHere we are at the Warschauer Bruecke over the Spree, where there is\r\nan imposing concourse of steel-helmeted troops and guns, and a cordon.\r\nWe pass this after being searched for arms, and across the bridge come\r\non a lot of guns and machine-guns firing fiercely down the Warschauer\r\nStrasse, though there is no audible reply or visible reason. After\r\nwatching the shells holing houses, we start working our way round to\r\nthe south through empty streets, keeping close to the house-fronts and\r\ntaking cover when bullets whisper a warning. At last crowded streets\r\nagain, and through them to a broad avenue crossed by shallow trenches\r\nand ramshackle barricades--the much-bulletined Frankfurter Allee. Here\r\nan insurgent picket takes charge of us and undertakes to bring us to\r\nthe secret Headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"But where are your field-guns?\" we ask.\r\n\r\n\"Field-guns? We haven't any,\" they say, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"And how do you keep the troops in check?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those boys! Two of us take machine-guns, charge with them down\r\neach side of the street, and they run.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how many of you are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some two or three hundred perhaps--it varies, but we're all old\r\nsoldiers--we allow no boys to fight for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you shot the sixty policemen you took in the Lichtenberg\r\nstation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty policemen? There aren't that number in all Lichtenberg. Two got\r\nshot defending the station, but after they surrendered to a quarter of\r\ntheir number we let them all go home. You can go and see any of them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to believe these intelligent, even intellectual\r\nand eminently honest faces. So the sixty policemen follow the\r\nfield-guns and the \"ring of steel\" into the limbo of \"White\" lies.\r\n\r\nWe pass a railway goods yard where plundered flour is being carried\r\naway in sacks.\r\n\r\n\"Where is that going?\" we ask.\r\n\r\n\"To the bakers, and afterwards to be distributed gratis to the crowd.\"\r\n\r\nWe see later women with red crosses distributing loaves from a cart to\r\nwomen and children. We reach our destination, only to be warned by a\r\nwoman just in time that it is now occupied by troops--a narrow escape\r\nthat so shakes the nerve of our guide that he takes refuge in a\r\ndressing station improvised in a shop. Here are \"neutral\" doctors and\r\nnurses, very angry at the bombardment of crowded tenement houses and\r\nthe reckless shooting by the young volunteers. They run great risks,\r\nas robbers have so often misused the Red Cross that it is now no\r\nprotection against the Government troops. Here are many wounded,\r\nmostly women and children, and but a few fighters. The latter all\r\nindignantly deny having shot prisoners, though they know the other\r\nside are doing it. And then at last to the evasive Headquarters, where\r\nthe leaders tell us of what they hope to achieve by this desperate\r\nresistance of a few hundred men armed with rifles and bombs against as\r\nmany thousands armed with all the machinery of modern war.\r\n\r\n\"Noske,\" they say, \"is only a puppet in the hands of Majors Gilsa and\r\nHammerstein, and they are agents of the Eden Hotel, the headquarters\r\nof the Cavalry Guard and the centre of reaction. The old story again\r\nof Bethmann-Hollweg, Ludendorff, and the General Staff, militarism and\r\nmonarchism is what all this bombardment means, for they want to\r\nconvince the Entente that they must have a large standing Army. They\r\nhave just raised the pay and doubled the rations of these young\r\nmercenaries. Why don't the Entente abolish them and insist on a Swiss\r\nMilitia here?\r\n\r\n\"If this White Guard goes on, we shall organise a Red Guard, and we\r\nshall win. But that will mean Bolshevism. We are not Bolsheviks, but\r\nSocialists to-day. We have offered to keep order in Berlin and here,\r\nwith a militia representing all parties, but they go on bombarding. It\r\nis the old Prussian terrorism again. They have learnt nothing from the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, so, in the twilight, back the way we came, wondering at the\r\nworking of moral laws that have now subjected Berlin to a\r\nself-inflicted punishment of bombardments and bombings worse than any\r\nof those it inflicted on other cities.\r\n\r\nFiring heavy artillery at crowded tenement houses, even with reduced\r\ncharges and plentiful blank, means a butcher's bill of several\r\nthousands, mostly women and children, and damage to property of\r\nseveral millions.\r\n\r\nNext day we extract the following from the advertisement sheet of our\r\ndaily paper:--\r\n\r\n    \"Reinhard Brigade. Mine-Throwers.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Officers, non-commissioned officers and men with mine-thrower\r\n    training urgently required. Comrades! Consider the crisis!\r\n    Come and help! Spartacus must be crushed with every weapon.\r\n    Report to the Brigade Reinhard, at the New Criminal Court,\r\n    Turmerstrasse 91.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Obituary.\"\r\n\r\n    \"On the 12th March, innocent victims of these troubled times,\r\n    through the destruction of my house by a mine-thrower, my\r\n    little Adolf and Bertha, aged 12 and 8 years.\"\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Government can only be explained by their having\r\nleft the whole matter to Noske, who, in turn, left it to his military\r\nadvisers, Majors Gilsa, Pabst, and Hammerstein, who again were agents\r\nonly of the militarist reactionary faction. This faction intended to\r\nexploit the crisis by killing two birds with one stone--the\r\nanti-Bolshevists at Paris and the pro-Bolshevists at Berlin. Their\r\npolicy was to make an excuse for raising a large professional army\r\nwith which to suppress the revolution and, if the gods were kind, to\r\nrestore Germany's ancient _regime_ and its racial frontiers. For this\r\npurpose atrocities were invented as a pretext for reprisals and for\r\nrecruiting and raising the pay of the Frei-Corps. The Government could\r\nhave kept order of a sort through the revolutionary corps if it had\r\nkept in touch with the revolutionary councils; but it fought the corps\r\nwith flying columns of under-trained over-armed boys, and it fought\r\nthe councils with its patched-up majority of old parliamentary hands\r\nand party hacks.\r\n\r\nIn the resultant civil war that raged, and still rages, all over\r\nGermany one may distinguish certain combats more decisive than the\r\nothers. There were the conflicts in Berlin--of December against the\r\nMarine Division, of January against the Spartacists, and of March\r\nagainst the Republican Guard and other corps. In the provinces, the\r\nexpeditions against Bremen, Halle, Brunswick, and Munich. I saw\r\nnothing of the first of these, but something of the fall of the\r\nrevolutionary movements of Halle, Brunswick, and Munich. And with each\r\nof these failures ended some distinctive element of the German\r\nrevolution. With each of these failures the German revolution took a\r\nfresh impetus and a more extreme form.\r\n\r\nThe trouble at Bremen was merely a collision between the centre of the\r\nrenascent reaction at Berlin and the original source of the revolution\r\namong the soldiers and sailors of the seaboard towns. The revolution\r\nfirst broke out at Bremen and was spread from there by parties of\r\nsailors who established themselves in the leading towns of the\r\ninterior, including Berlin; and wherever they settled they became the\r\n\"Red Guard\" of the revolution. Bremen was therefore not only the\r\nBethlehem of the new gospel, but was also the key position to the\r\ncontrol of the coast. And this control was indispensable to the\r\nGovernment, which was negotiating with the Allies for the importation\r\nof foodstuffs in mitigation of the blockade. For the revolutionary\r\nextremists, recognising that the blockade was breeding revolt, kept\r\nthrowing every difficulty in the way of importing food. They first\r\nrefused to allow the German steamers to sail under the agreement, and\r\nthen refused to allow foodstuffs to be unloaded. The Government were\r\nthus forced, probably not unwillingly, into military action against\r\nthe revolution in the interests of famine relief. When Gerstenberg's\r\nflying column occupied Bremen in February with little serious\r\nfighting, the revolutionary policy of barring off Germany from the\r\nconservative West and turning it towards the Council government of\r\nRussia finally failed. The desperate plan of strangling and starving\r\nGermany into revolution was defeated by the German middle class, who\r\npreferred, even at the cost of immediate civil war, to go into\r\neconomic slavery to France and England rather than to go into\r\npolitical outlawry with Russia. The fall of Bremen really finished all\r\nimmediate chances of Russian \"Bolshevism\" in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Halle affair in March was a less crucial business, though critical\r\nenough for a time. The Saxon towns had been in a state of economic\r\nunrest that increased as the impotence of the Weimar Assembly became\r\nmore obvious. Thus the smaller towns in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof Weimar, like Erfurt and Jena, became outposts of revolution,\r\npermanently menacing the deliberations of the Assembly in the classic\r\ngroves of the Ilm. Small bands of revolutionaries even penetrated\r\nWeimar itself, until the roads and railways were barred. It was some\r\nweeks before the Saxon Frei-Corps of Jagers, under General Maerker,\r\nwere strong enough to attempt expeditions against the smaller\r\nThuringian towns. And the General himself had, in these early days,\r\nmore than one narrow escape. His small force was still very weak in\r\nnumbers and discipline when a general strike was declared at Halle,\r\nwith the avowed political object of cutting communications between the\r\nLegislature at Weimar and the Administration at Berlin. Obviously, if\r\nWeimar could be seized, or even surrounded by the revolutionaries, the\r\nparliamentary system of government must collapse and a revolutionary\r\nSaxony would divide the Prussian bureaucrats from the South German\r\nburghers. This plan--if plan it was--and not merely a process of\r\ninchoate and unconscious forces, was defeated by the Maerker\r\nexpedition to Halle; and those who are interested in the outside as\r\nwell as the inside of political events may learn something of what the\r\ncivil war in Germany was like in the following diary of my\r\nexperiences with this expedition.\r\n\r\n_Friday Afternoon._--The green room of the Weimar Theatre--now the\r\nNational Assembly--and the War Minister Noske on a sofa, a big\r\nbeetle-browed, bullet-headed type of German, a Bismarck Mk. II., but\r\nevidently underfed and overstrained. On a chair a sharp-nosed\r\nintelligence officer, for War Ministers must be careful these days who\r\nthey see and what they say. After some talk I ask leave to go with the\r\nGovernment troops who are to reopen the rail to Berlin by occupying\r\nHalle. The intelligence officer demurs, but Noske good humouredly\r\nagrees to my arguments, scribbles a word or two on the back of my\r\ncard, and hurries off to catch the Berlin train. He will have to spend\r\nall night going round by Chemnitz and Dresden.\r\n\r\n_Friday Midnight._--A fourth-class carriage in the third of three\r\ntroop trains conveying 4,000 men and 20 guns to Halle. Five of us are\r\nperched on the narrow wooden seats; two officers in mufti, and two\r\nHalle deputies going as Government delegates, one a brisk little\r\nDemocrat, the other a patriarchal Social-Democrat, in a long white\r\nbeard and a broad black hat. We make the best of it. One officer has a\r\ncandle, the other a stock of war adventures; I have a bottle of wine\r\nand a budget of news from outside; the patriarch has sections of an\r\neel and views on the food question, which he roars like a hungry lion.\r\nBump! we are mostly on the floor. The engine of No. 2 has broken down,\r\nand we have trodden on and derailed its tail. We pile into train No.\r\n1, and get cushioned seats. The officers snore, the patriarch dozes,\r\nrumbling like a distant storm. Only the little Democrat sits brooding.\r\n\"Oh, Halle! Halle!\" he mutters, \"that I should ever come to you like\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n_Saturday Morning._--The General and I are marching up the road to\r\nHalle; behind us officers in mufti, beside us the head of the column\r\nof volunteers. The little General is telling me this is the seventh\r\ntown he and his flying column have occupied, but the first real big\r\none. An expert in Bolshevist busting, this tiny General of a toy army,\r\nwith the face and manner of a dear demure little old maiden lady. He\r\nignores politely the women and boys, who are shouting, \"Bloodhounds!\"\r\n\"Brutes!\" \"Vultures!\" \"Vermin!\" and salutes scrupulously any burgher\r\nbold enough to wave.\r\n\r\nSo we enter Halle, pass the factories and skyscrapers, where the hands\r\nlive stacked in tiers, and then occupy the station yard. The General\r\nwith a few officers and men, marches straight through the great\r\ndeserted station into the guardroom of the insurgent troops. The\r\nguard, taken by surprise, seize their rifles, and some cock and point\r\nthem, shouting threats. The little General raps out an order like a\r\nmachine-gun, and after a long half-minute a man drops his rifle, the\r\nothers follow suit, and all file out--one shouting in a heart-broken\r\nvoice, \"Is this all we can do?\" A deputation of sailors arrives, fine\r\nupstanding fellows, with intelligent faces. These are the real\r\nfighters, and some hundreds of them are occupying a building in the\r\ntown. They have probably only come to find out what chance there is of\r\nholding it, and the guns outside are answer enough, for they leave\r\nabruptly. The General sends a summons to evacuate after them, and they\r\nhave cleared before their building is surrounded. \"Those cursed blue\r\nboys,\" says a young officer. \"What wouldn't I have done for them\r\nduring the war, and now they've brought us to this.\"\r\n\r\n_Saturday Afternoon._--The General with a few officers and a\r\nhalf-company, is walking down to the Town Hall to arrange with the\r\nlocal authorities. I am congratulating him on everything being so well\r\nover--and add, as I see the market-place ahead packed with people and\r\nugly-looking roughs hooting us--that in England things would be about\r\ngoing to begin. I've hardly said it before they do begin. The crowd,\r\nannoyed at the hauling down of the red flag and hoisting of the red,\r\nwhite, and black, storms the Town Hall, tears the machine-guns and\r\nrifles from our guard there, and smashes them, seizes a motor and an\r\nambulance, which it afterwards runs blazing into the river, and\r\ncarries off two officers, whom it shuts up in the Red Tower, a\r\nmediaeval fortress. They then turn on our little party, which is in\r\nrapid retreat on the Post Office, but we stand them off until we are\r\nbehind the iron gates. An angry mob howls outside, but when they get\r\nto shaking or scaling the gates a movement from the sentries inside is\r\nenough still to stop them. At last reinforcements arrive, forcing\r\ntheir way through the crowd, which, however, falls on the last files\r\nand tries to haul them off. We sally out and pull them in, shouting to\r\nthe soldiers, now as angry as the mob, not to shoot. But already there\r\ncomes the crack of rifles and the rattle of a machine-gun from another\r\nposition up the street. Firing becomes general. The crowd scatters in\r\nall directions, and the empty streets round are picketed with\r\nmachine-guns. The General, regardless of roof snipers, comes round,\r\npatting his young soldiers on the back. \"Well,\" says he to me, \"here\r\nwe are, and the only question is, are we holding Halle or is Halle\r\nholding us?\"\r\n\r\n_Saturday Evening._--A long table in the Post Office. At one end the\r\nlittle General, behind him two officers, one smiling, the other\r\nscowling. On his right the two \"Independent\" tribunes of the people,\r\nrepresenting the workmen's councils, beyond them commandants of the\r\nlocal barracks, at the foot representatives of the burgher committee\r\nand the little Democrat, on the General's left representatives of the\r\nsoldiers' council, probably students. The Patriarch has, however,\r\ndisappeared, the march of events having been too rapid for him. The\r\nGeneral is very short with the student soldiers, and very urbane with\r\nthe Independent politicians who are or were in control of Halle--one\r\nis another Bismarck type, Mk. III. this time, the other a Bernard Shaw\r\nMk. II. A strong combination of authority with audacity; but I doubt\r\nthe General with his steel-helmeted troops and machine-guns will be\r\nstronger. Their case is that they kept order until the troops came,\r\nand they can only restore it if the troops go. The General and the\r\nburgher delegates accuse them of arming and agitating the proletariat,\r\nwhich they indignantly deny. The discussion is interrupted at\r\nintervals by the irruption of dingy individuals, who report disorders\r\nand discoveries, and I suspect the General of having realised the\r\ndramatic value of the messenger in Greek tragedy. Finally, the two\r\ntribunes agree to put out posters that the troops have nothing to do\r\nwith the strike, and must be let alone. This negative result horrifies\r\nthe burghers, and the General, leaving the table, is besieged by\r\nearwigging notables imploring him to arrest the two tribunes. \"I saw\r\nthem leaving the house that fired the first shot,\" hisses a flabby\r\nfrock-coated party with a grog-blossomy nose. \"Bernard Shaw\" overhears\r\nhim, but only strokes his thin beard and his moustaches curl in a\r\ncynical smile. He knows the General knows his business.\r\n\r\n_Saturday Midnight._--I've been out and in through the pickets and\r\namong the armed parties of the other side several times, and a major\r\nin mufti and I are going out to a hotel. Two journalists who've made\r\ntheir way in, and regret it, decide to follow us. Nearing the cleared\r\nstreet, we turn up a side street and come right on an armed party. The\r\njournalists, a few paces behind, bolt round the corner, which leads to\r\nour being stopped and questioned. I engage their attention all I can\r\nto give the major a chance of slipping off, which he wisely does.\r\nUnfortunately, this gives time for a larger crowd to gather than I\r\ncan manage, and they march me off to the market-place, where they\r\nbecome a mob. Ugly roughs and excited boys keep pressing in, and\r\nseveral have seen me with the General. The ring round me gets savage,\r\nand I have increasing difficulty in keeping those round me quiet. A\r\nman shouts at me in Russian, asking whether I'm from Joffe. I\r\nrepudiate Joffe, but knowing Russian gets me a friend or two. One\r\ncalls up some armed sailors and persuades them to take me to their\r\nguard-house. A plucky little burgher who has been appearing and\r\ndisappearing in the welter attaches himself to the party. The crowd\r\nfollows until a machine-gun opens near by and scatters it. Our party\r\ngets smaller each time we run or shelter from the machine-guns, which\r\nare playing on the plundering parties. I find the burgher will take me\r\nin if I get rid of the escort, so, distributing some small notes, I\r\nsuggest we should all be better off at home. Some agree, others\r\nobject, but a machine-gun closures the debate without a division and I\r\nspend the night on the friendly burgher's sofa.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Morning._--I hear from the burgher that an aide-de-camp of the\r\nGeneral caught by the mob in mufti with the General's orders in his\r\npocket, soon after my escape, has been thrown into the river and shot\r\nas he swam. The town is still in the hands of the revolutionaries,\r\nbut quite quiet except round the buildings held by the troops. After\r\nchanging my appearance and borrowing the burgher's hat, I go round in\r\na crowd of Sunday sightseers staring at the looted shops and the\r\nbullet-starred houses. Near the Post Office there is sniping from the\r\nroofs, and a hand grenade is thrown almost on top of us. There are\r\nugly red blotches in the streets among the broken glass. Running the\r\ngauntlet of the pickets, I find the General very glad to see me. The\r\nscowling officer shows me a sniper behind a chimney-pot who has just\r\nshot the smiling officer. The situation militarily and politically is\r\ntemporarily at a deadlock, and the only interest in staying is the\r\nrisk of being sniped in the Post Office or mobbed in the town. The\r\nGeneral offers me a passage to Weimar with the \"flying post.\"\r\n\r\n_Sunday Afternoon._--The Halle flying ground. While one of the few\r\nplanes left is being patched up the officer is telling me of his\r\ndifficulties. He daren't leave the men alone for an hour. The plane\r\nwith the post for Weimar I travel with has to be represented as going\r\nto Magdeburg, or the men might stop its starting. He holds on because\r\nthe planes are indispensable to the Government, but when he came back\r\nfrom the front, and the orders and badges were torn from his coat,\r\n\"something broke in him.\" His family has always been military, but now\r\nit's over, and he is going to the Argentine. But my pilot is tougher\r\nstuff. A man of the middle class, pilot since 1912, fighting scout\r\nthrough the war, a friend of the great fliers and of Fokker, he had\r\nhad good openings abroad. \"But no,\" says he; \"Germany's going down out\r\nof control, but if it crashes I crash with it.\"\r\n\r\nSo after careful scrutiny to see that nothing has been half sawn\r\nthrough, as it was a few days before, we climb in. The roar of the\r\nmotor drowns the distant rattle of the machine-guns, and Halle\r\ndisappears below into the dusk as we drive into the red glare of the\r\nsetting sun.\r\n\r\nGermany at this time was like a seething pot. Outbreaks such as that\r\nat Halle were only bubbles breaking out on the surface. At any moment\r\none expected the whole heaving, simmering mass to boil over. But,\r\nwherever a centre of ebullition declared itself the Government\r\nquenched the upheaval with a douche of Frei-Corps.\r\n\r\nSuch a centre from the first days of revolution was Brunswick. Indeed,\r\nBrunswick had been such a centre of disturbance from the earliest\r\ndays of German history. The chronicles of Brunswick show the workmen\r\nof that town always in the van not only of German but of European\r\nmovements. They were indeed Bolsheviks as early as 1292; and it was\r\nlargely owing to the improvement in the workmen's position that they\r\nforced on the German towns in the following century that the general\r\nrisings of the proletariat, that led to civil war in England and\r\nFrance, were in Saxony comparatively bloodless.[A]\r\n\r\nAnd, as soon as the revolution broke out in the North Sea Coast towns,\r\nBrunswick gave it its first welcome to the interior. Bodies of\r\nsailors, travelling up from the coast as the vanguard of revolution,\r\nhad established it in Brunswick, the day after the first outbreak at\r\nWilhelmshaven; and thereafter Brunswick threw itself wholeheartedly\r\ninto a real revolutionary _regime_.\r\n\r\nThe little State of Brunswick consists of the mediaeval town and a ring\r\nof industrial suburbs separate from the town, with satellite rural\r\ntownlets and villages. The political life and vital heat of Brunswick\r\ncentre now in this mushroom ring of factories, where the old rebel\r\ncharacter of the State is more truly reproduced than among the\r\nburghers and bauers of the dead town and dormant villages. Under\r\npressure from the workmen in these factories Brunswick established a\r\ngovernment that, unlike that of Berlin, was sufficiently revolutionary\r\nto attempt to realise the social revolution. When the inevitable split\r\ncame between the Social-Democrats in power and the Independents in\r\nopposition, Brunswick declared for the Independents. The free Republic\r\nof Brunswick became a citadel of the Independent extremists, a centre\r\nof revolutionary propaganda and a _corpus vile_ for the application of\r\nrevolutionary principles. And it was unfortunate that it made itself\r\nso obnoxious to its big neighbour, Berlin, in its first two characters\r\nthat its services in the third capacity were overlooked. For Brunswick\r\nwas working out a _regime_ which was in fact a compromise between the\r\nrevolutionary institutions of council government and the established\r\nparliamentary system of its constitutional Government. True\r\nparliamentary institutions had under the leadership of extremists like\r\nMerges been relegated rather to the background. But they had not been\r\nabolished and remained ready to function, when required, as a sort of\r\nSecond Chamber and conservative counterbalance to the radical _regime_\r\nof the Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils. Nor had this _regime_ so far\r\nas I could ascertain done any irremediable material harm, while it had\r\ncertainly done real moral service. The propertied and professional\r\nclasses had been alarmed certainly; but had learnt to defend\r\nthemselves very effectively by strikes and refusal of taxes, and had\r\nthereby obtained recognition of their rights as a numerical minority.\r\nFeeling, of course, ran high; but the freedom of speech of the\r\nburghers was never curtailed while the workmen's party was in power.\r\nOf course, the workmen's leader, the hunchback tailor Merges, was\r\nrepresented as a sort of ogre throughout Germany, but the Brunswick\r\nburghers rather despised than dreaded him. Their opinion of the rule\r\nof the \"Arbeiter Rat,\" or Workmen's Board, is expressed in these lines\r\npasted on the pedestal of the equestrian statue representing Duke\r\nWilliam of ever pious and still immortal memory (obiit, 1884).\r\n\r\n    \"Good Old Bill, if you'll get down,\r\n    Merges shall give up your crown.\r\n    We'll put you on the Board, of course,\r\n    And put the tailor on your horse.\"\r\n\r\nAs reaction developed at Berlin and revolution at Brunswick it became\r\nevident that once again in its history a bullying Berlin would bash a\r\nbumptious Brunswick. This simple solution as between the two centres\r\nof the main conflict that has divided Germany was delayed by cross\r\ncomplications coming from conflicts belonging to another plane, and to\r\nan older chapter. Brunswick town, unlike Halle or Hamburg, was a free\r\nRepublic--more than that it was a semi-sovereign State. The\r\nsemi-sovereign rights of the lesser German States were one of the\r\nancient bulwarks used by the reactionary government as defences\r\nagainst a levelling revolution. They were particularly dear to the\r\nCentrum supporters of the Government as the temporal entrenchments of\r\nthe Clerical position. And so the free and Independent republicans of\r\nBrunswick had a longer lease of power than might have been expected.\r\n\r\nFinally, political and personal considerations combined to overcome\r\nthe reluctance of the Berlin Government to take military action\r\nagainst a Free State. As usual the personal factor probably forced the\r\ndecision and the incident throws a sidelight on German politics of\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\nMagdeburg, an industrial town on the main line between Berlin and\r\nBrunswick and on the borders of Brunswick State, had been a political\r\nstronghold of Majoritarian Social-Democracy. But it had been so\r\naffected by the drift of the workmen to the left that by the end of\r\nApril the Independents believed they had a majority in that\r\nparliamentary constituency. Now the representative of this\r\nconstituency was the moving spirit, the Machiavelli, of the\r\nministry--Landsberg. This Polish Jew has already been referred to as\r\nthe brains of the Government. He, as representing Majoritarian Social\r\nDemocracy and Erzberger as representing middle-class Clericalism, were\r\nthe cement of the coalition between Social-Democracy and the Centrum,\r\na coalition based on love of office and fear of the Opposition. So\r\nLandsberg finding his own seat threatening defection to the Opposition\r\nand joining a general strike of the Saxon towns, went down to\r\nMagdeburg. But on his arrival he was seized by the revolutionaries,\r\nput in a car, and sent off to Brunswick to be held to ransom. This\r\nkidnapping of the reactionary Minister of Justice, second only to\r\nNoske himself in importance, was a score for the revolution. But a red\r\nJew is kittle cattle to drive. Landsberg escaped from his captors, and\r\nwithin a few days General Maerker and his merry men were marching on\r\nMagdeburg from Halle. Magdeburg was occupied after slight resistance,\r\nand became the base for operations against Brunswick. Only a _casus\r\nbelli_ was required and this was supplied when Brunswick, encouraged\r\nby the Munich revolution, proclaimed a \"Raete Republik,\" and invited\r\nthe Saxon towns to rally to the revolution and the \"Soviet system.\"\r\nThis was immediately countered by the officials and clerks of\r\nBrunswick organising a strike that crippled the Prussian railway and\r\nthe German postal and telegraph system. Whereupon Berlin declared that\r\nit had ground for intervention in Brunswick, the State frontier was\r\nclosed and Frei-Corps expeditions advanced from Magdeburg and Hanover.\r\nSkirmishes occurred at Helmstadt, Borsum and Wolfenbuettel and both\r\nsides had losses. Brunswick called off the general strike, protested\r\nagainst the violation of State right and tried to make terms. There\r\nfollowed a pause in the operations during which the moderates on both\r\nsides were trying to arrange matters. Meantime the Communists and\r\nCouncil revolutionaries of Brunswick were preparing resistance, in the\r\nconfidence that the revolutionaries of the Saxon towns would rise in\r\nthe rear of the troops; while the reactionaries were mobilising\r\nrapidly tanks and howitzers with the intention of giving the\r\nRevolution the _coup de grace_. It was at this moment that I decided\r\nto go to Brunswick partly to study its revolutionary institutions\r\nbefore they were wiped out, partly to prevent bloodshed if possible by\r\ninforming the revolutionary leaders as to the small prospect of\r\nBrunswick, if it resisted, getting any support from Saxony or Prussia.\r\nIt was not an easy journey and the following account of it from my\r\ndiary may serve as an illustration of Germany at this time.\r\n\r\n_Monday Evening._--The notorious Eden Hotel, headquarters of the\r\nBerlin garrison and military police. I am waiting for a permit to go\r\nwith the expedition against Brunswick. When I went with the same\r\ntroops against Halle a month ago I got my permit from Noske himself,\r\nbut the captain in charge at the Eden Hotel is only second in real\r\nimportance to the War Minister. There is, I suppose, a War Office and\r\nGeneral Staff still, with generals and colonels, but the Government is\r\nbased on the volunteer corps and they are run from the Eden Hotel. And\r\nnow Brunswick, not for the first time, has championed the cause of\r\nGerman revolution and challenged Berlin, which has become, not for the\r\nfirst time, the centre of German reaction. And Berlin has determined\r\nto bash the head of revolution in Brunswick as it broke its back in\r\nHalle. True, Brunswick is a free State with its own constitution,\r\nwhich only differs from that of Prussia in preserving the principles\r\nof the November revolution; but it has become a centre of\r\nrevolutionary opposition connecting the industrial districts of\r\nWestphalia with those of Saxony. There has been a plan for concerted\r\naction. Brunswick has given the signal too soon and realised its\r\nmistake too late. Brunswick, says the Eden Hotel, will fight in the\r\nhope of support from the Saxon towns, not knowing that they will not\r\nrise, for it has been isolated for a week.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday Morning._--A fourth-class carriage in the \"parliamentary\" to\r\nMagdeburg. There are third-class carriages, but a haversack on the\r\nfloor is more comfortable than a straight-backed wooden bench. But\r\nimagine traffic between London and Derby reduced to three trains\r\ndaily, two of which stop at every station. A peasant woman sitting on\r\na sack is complaining:--\"We get up at four every morning and work till\r\ndark. The cabbages and potatoes lie at the stations for days; the sun\r\nshines on them, the rain rains on them, and they rot--no trains--so we\r\nstarve in the fields and you starve in the towns. A burgher frau tells\r\nhow a barge load of American wheat has arrived at her town--\"but what\r\nuse is it at that price?\" A man explains the high price is only for\r\nthe extra ration and that most of it goes to make up the old ration at\r\nthe old rate. \"But,\" objects another, \"we shall have to pay for it all\r\nthe same, and we can't.\" \"Emigration, that's what it means,\" says a\r\nsoldier. \"Why emigrate?\" says a young man--\"socialisation and Council\r\nGovernment are what's wanted, then the workmen will work and we can\r\npay.\" You can hear more sound politics and economics now in\r\nfourth-class carriages than at Weimar, for hunger is the best\r\npolitical education. But--\"Oh, politics, always politics now,\"\r\nprotests a pretty girl The soldier gallantly responds and the debate\r\nbecomes a Beatrice and Benedict duel, altogether too Shakespearean to\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday Evening._--The General's headquarters. I hand my friend the\r\nGeneral my credentials from my right-hand pocket, in my left are\r\nletters to Brunswick leaders. Public disorder makes for personal\r\norderliness, and getting passes mixed in his pockets cost an officer\r\nacquaintance of mine his life lately. The General tells me he is\r\nmarching against Brunswick--horse, foot and artillery--next evening. I\r\ncan go ahead in the armoured train or an armoured car. But I explain\r\nthis time I want to see the occupation from the other side and so must\r\nget into Brunswick well ahead. However, the General doesn't respond to\r\nmy request to be set down outside Brunswick from one of the aeroplanes\r\nemployed in distributing proclamations. Brunswick has been cut off by\r\nroad and rail for days, and he evidently prefers it should remain so.\r\nBrunswick, he says, means to fight and must get a sharp lesson. Anyway\r\nit's impossible for anyone to get in now. And at first sight one would\r\nsay he was right. Brunswick is sixty miles from Magdeburg by rail,\r\ntrains only run in other directions, and even for them one must have a\r\npermit. All planes and cars are under control of the troops. So it\r\nwill have to be the \"underground railway\" for me. For, when you drive\r\na revolution underground it won't be long before there's an\r\nunderground railway. It's quite easy even for a foreigner without\r\nlocal friends to get down the lifts and along the passages to it,\r\nprovided he can find the way in. And a good place to look for the\r\nentrance is a newspaper office.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday Morning._--A back room in a beerhouse of a back street in\r\nMagdeburg. I am being booked through to Brunswick on the underground.\r\nThe \"tickets\" are being made out among the slops and my guide is\r\ngetting his instructions. For all tours on the underground are\r\npersonally conducted.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday Evening._--A beerhouse in a back street of Brunswick. We\r\nhave run the blockade successfully, and are waiting to be sent for by\r\nthe revolutionary government. We reached Brunswick soon after dark,\r\nhaving travelled hard all day. First, leaving Magdeburg by train and\r\ngoing north, we got out at a wayside station where a carriage and pair\r\nwas waiting. This drove us at a great pace over the rolling uplands to\r\nthe outskirts of a village. Whom it belonged to I didn't hear, but it\r\nhad the best pair of horses I saw in Germany. Next came a sharp run\r\nacross country to a halt on a local steam tramway, which took us down\r\nto a junction where we got a train. The train had to be left\r\nunostentatiously _en route_. Fortunately, German trains don't go very\r\nfast nowadays; but standing on the end platform and waiting to jump\r\nwhile my Communist guide turned somersaults on the embankment, I\r\nshould have preferred even my lop-winged Halle aeroplane to the\r\nBrunswick \"underground.\" Another walk to a local station from which a\r\ntrain ran backwards and forwards to Brunswick. As we arrived it came\r\nup loaded with refugees who were retiring to country farms to escape\r\nthe imminent invasion of the Prussian troops.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday Midnight._--Government House Brunswick.--The town is\r\nplunged in darkness but the Government building is all ablaze with\r\nlights and a-bustle with figures hurrying to and fro past the lighted\r\nwindows. Inside there is a curious nightmare feeling of hampered haste\r\nand of imminent menace. Round a long table in an upper room sits a\r\nsort of council of war distractedly discussing whether Brunswick shall\r\nresist the Prussian troops that are due to arrive at dawn. In a sort\r\nof drawing-room adjoining, other members of the Independent Government\r\nsit about listlessly in fauteuils brought over from the palace, or\r\npace restlessly about the room. A Communist is trying to spur the\r\nCouncil on to fight, assuring them that the soldiers and sailors are\r\nready to face the tanks and trench mortars--which is true, and that\r\nthe workmen will support them--which is not. A sailor suddenly appears\r\nin the Council room excitedly waving an object in his hand which it\r\nseems is a bomb that has just been found hidden in the cellars--but\r\nwhether intended to blow up the revolutionaries or to be subsequently\r\nfound by the reactionaries and exploited as an \"atrocity\" is not\r\nclear. Anyway, no one pays any attention to him, and annoyed at this\r\nhe proceeds to take it to pieces to prove it's a real bomb. I persuade\r\nhim to go away and drown it.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Council decide not to fight. This definite decision\r\nwakes us all up from the nightmare. Telephone orders are at once sent\r\nout to the outposts, everyone hurries off on some mission, and as we\r\ngo home the dark alleys are full of dim hastening groups hauling heavy\r\nobjects--machine-guns and rifles to be thrown into the river or\r\nburied.\r\n\r\n_Thursday Morning._--A hotel window looking on the main square. I am\r\ntaking down the history of revolutionary Brunswick from the dictation\r\nof one of the leading revolutionaries, while below the Prussian troops\r\nare marching in. The organisation of the Independent Government has\r\nmade good in its last crisis and not a shot has been fired, to the\r\nopenly expressed disappointment of the invaders. The hotel, awkwardly\r\nenough, has been commandeered as an auxiliary headquarters, and I have\r\nto escort my informant out past groups of officers and see him safely\r\naway into the \"underground railway.\" He is one of the few wanted men\r\nwho get clean away. Merges and others escaping in aeroplanes and in\r\ncars are with few exceptions caught. Merges himself, subsequently, is\r\nreleased by friendly jailers.\r\n\r\nThe burghers in the streets exult at their deliverance and some of the\r\ngirls throw flowers to the troops. A young volunteer in an armoured\r\ncar catches a bunch gracefully and I recognise him as a scion of the\r\nprincely house of Reuss. At the back of the crowd stalwart men in\r\nill-fitting civilian clothes glower gloomily. A girl at an attic\r\nwindow in a side street cries shrill abuse at the \"steel helmets\" and\r\none boy in joke points his rifle at her. It goes off, the bullet stars\r\nthe plaster and the boy looks as terrified as the girl. It is the only\r\nshot fired at the fall of the Free Republic of Brunswick.\r\n\r\n_Thursday Evening._--The General has deposed the Government of\r\nIndependents and set up another of Majoritarians, has arrested all the\r\nleaders he can find and has proclaimed the severest form of martial\r\nlaw. Many burghers are already regretting the revolutionary _regime_.\r\nThe streets are almost deserted for it is already dusk and no one may\r\nbe out of doors after sundown. In the shadows under the overhanging\r\ngables of the mediaeval market-place gleams the steel helm of a\r\nPrussian picket. Other cloaked and helmed figures gather round a fire\r\ndown a side street. Brunswick is back in the Middle Ages and these\r\nmight be Tilly's men. A fat burgher creeps cautiously past the hotel.\r\nEvery evening for years he has trotted to the cosy beer cellar round\r\nthe corner. Shall these bedamned Prussians keep a free Brunswicker\r\nfrom his beer. After several false starts he marches boldly out across\r\nthe market. Bang goes a blank cartridge from the Prussian sentry and\r\nthe burgher bolts back into obscurity. The liberty of Brunswick is no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Raete Republik at Munich got more attention than\r\nthe Brunswick attempt but was really less interesting because less\r\nindigenous. The relative importance of the two was more accurately\r\nassessed at Berlin. Berlin has always had a difficulty in taking\r\nMunich politics seriously. It has had to recognise its superiority in\r\nArt and Literature, but compensates itself in matters political by an\r\namused arrogance not unlike the attitude of London to Dublin. But\r\nMunich is not Bavaria. If it were, the Prussians and Wurtembergers\r\nwould never have ventured to interfere; for the Bavarian is far too\r\nfierce a fighter and too jealous of his freedom for all the rest of\r\nGermany to coerce him as a nation. However, it soon became evident\r\nthat Munich Communism represented only a section of the Munich workmen\r\nand was resented by Bavaria as a whole, with the exception of the\r\nproletariat in the large industrial towns. Even so, the Berlin\r\nGovernment acted cautiously. It was indeed in a difficult position;\r\nfor the policy that Scheidemann's socialism stood for was one of\r\ncompromise with political clericalism and provincial particularism.\r\nHis minister, Preuss, then framing the constitution, had been\r\nreluctantly compelled to reject the conception of the more radical\r\nreformers who had hoped to found a wholly uniform and wholly united\r\ncentralised German Socialist State. The Government had been forced to\r\nuse the political jealousies of the German States and the clerical\r\nprejudices of the Centrum as weapons against the social revolution. It\r\nwould not be too much to say of this period of German politics that\r\nonly the revolutionary adherents of the Council movement were Germans;\r\nwhile the upper and middle classes had again become Prussians, Saxons\r\nor Bavarians. And now it had become necessary to coerce the capital of\r\nBavaria, the centre of Roman Catholicism and the most sensitive and\r\nimportant of the minor kingdoms. And this, too, at the very time when\r\neverything was being done to induce German-Austria, Bavaria's\r\nneighbour, to accept the same sort of position in the Realm as that\r\nheld by Bavaria. It was a most awkward predicament and the German\r\nGovernment showed less than its usual tactlessness in dealing with it.\r\nIt arranged with the Bavarian bourgeois Government, when matters came\r\nto a crisis at Munich, that it should take refuge at Bamberg, where it\r\ncould be protected by the Government's troops centred at Weimar. Then\r\nit arranged with Wuertemberg and Baden to supply troops to restore this\r\nBamberg _ancien regime_, supporting them with Saxons and, at first,\r\nkeeping the Prussian corps in the background. Operations were then\r\nbegun, first against the Franconian towns of North Bavaria, where\r\nBavarian sentiment was weak. Any attempt against Munich was delayed\r\nuntil a raging Press propaganda against the rule of the Munich\r\nBolshevists in the Wittelsbach Palais, and the crushing of the\r\nmovement everywhere else, had excited the class feeling of the\r\npropertied farmers and burghers and had exorcised temporarily Bavarian\r\njealousy of Prussia. All this, however, would not have ensured Berlin\r\nsuccess, but for the inherent weakness of the Munich revolutionaries.\r\nThe movement for Council Government and general Communism had lost all\r\nchance of success when it was forced either by the policy of its\r\nenemies or by the jealousies of its supporters into the hands of men\r\nlike the Russian extremists, Levine and Levien.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of both men during my stay in Munich a few days\r\nbefore their fall, and both were very frank as to the hopelessness of\r\ntheir position. They were very different. Levine was a black Jew of a\r\ncommon and rather criminal type, with a bad record, but great ability\r\nof a sort. Levien was a cosmopolitan and a Bohemian--in appearance and\r\nabilities a dissolute and demoralised version--a Bohemian and\r\nBolshevist caricature--of the Treasury official who now represents us\r\nand rules Germany on the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\nA curious picture it was this Communist dictatorship in the\r\nWittelsbach palace. Outside--crowds of workmen waiting for the posting\r\nof the bulletins in which decrees were proclaimed. Inside--a great\r\ncoming and going of seedy-looking revolutionaries--a frantic\r\nclattering of typewriters pounded by unkempt girls--hurried conclaves\r\nin corners--remains of meals on marble tables--the dubious atmosphere\r\nof a Quartier Latin garret--the high pressure of a Bolshevist\r\nheadquarters and the melancholy madness of a Wittelsbach pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in Bavaria after the revolution had rested\r\nentirely on the personal power of the idealist Jew, Kurt Eisner. His\r\ninfluence over both revolutionaries and reformers produced in Munich a\r\ncoalition of Socialists in which the predominant element was\r\nprogressive; whereas in Berlin, for want of any such personality the\r\ncoalition split up into reactionaries and revolutionaries. The\r\nassassination of Eisner and the disablement of Auer on 21st February\r\nwere succeeded by some weeks of the Hoffmann Government during which\r\nthe issue as between parliamentary and council government was defining\r\nitself. The distribution of force at this time appears from a division\r\nin the Assembly of Councils where the proclamation of a Raete-Republik\r\n(a Council State) was outvoted by 230 to 70; Levien himself, the\r\nBolshevist, declaring against it as premature. But during March the\r\nstrong movement to the left and towards a Council constitution,\r\nnoticeable in the Berlin Raete-Congress, made apparently even greater\r\nprogress in the Bavarian industrial towns. Majority-Socialists, the\r\nSocial-Democrats, found their followers going over _en masse_ to the\r\nIndependents, while the latter lost equally heavily to the Communists.\r\nIn Prussia the Majoritarians had made up for this loss of popular\r\nsupport by creating a military force strong enough to resist any\r\nattempt to overthrow them by other than constitutional means. But in\r\nBavaria the Majority party found itself being left in the air. It\r\nseems thereupon to have adopted a policy of outbidding its opponents.\r\nAt Augsburg, late in March, Niekisch, a leading Majoritarian, declared\r\nfor a Raete-Republik exclusive of Parliament, and succeeded in getting\r\nit voted. The vote was later rescinded under influence of the\r\nIndependents and Communists, but restored under Majoritarian pressure.\r\nThe same curious reversal of roles followed in Munich, where a\r\nMajoritarian, Thomas, pressed for a Raete-Republik. A commission of\r\nLeft Majoritarians and Right Independents was appointed on April 4th\r\nand adopted a programme including the dictatorship of the working\r\nclass, the organisation of a council system on an industrial and\r\nprofessional basis, the socialisation of industries, banks, and land,\r\nthe revolutionising of administrative, judicial, and educational\r\nsystems, the separation of Church and State, compulsory work for all\r\nclasses, the formation of a Red Army, and alliance with Hungary and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThis programme was to be executed by a Central Council and\r\nCommissioners, equally composed of Independents, Communists, and\r\nSocial-Democrats. At first the Communists refused to join and\r\nattacked the new Government bitterly as a humbug; but later, after\r\nproclamation of the Raete-Republik and a Council constitution, agreed\r\nto co-operate in the Central Council in an advisory capacity. The\r\nRaete-Republik was proclaimed on April 7th. The Hoffmann Government\r\nleft; but soon after reappeared, first at Nuremberg and then at\r\nBamberg, where it established itself as a sort of Bavarian Weimar. The\r\nBerlin Government at once refused recognition to the new _regime_,\r\nwhile it gave every countenance and support to the Bamberg Government.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Sunday the 13th, a \"_putsch_\" under the leadership\r\nof a _ci-devant_, von Seifertitz, and a Majoritarian, Loewenfeld,\r\nsupported by the Republican _Schutztruppe_, overthrew this Government\r\nand arrested the Independent members of the Central Council, as also\r\nMuehsam, a non-partisan idealist. The Communists then took immediate\r\naction and a hundred or so armed workmen under Toller, a young\r\nIndependent officer, ejected as many soldiers from the railway station\r\nat the cost of two killed and a few wounded and some broken windows--a\r\nscuffle represented in Berlin as a desperate battle in which the\r\nstation and surrounding houses had been completely destroyed. The\r\nCommunists then formed a \"Bolshevist\" Government under Commissioners,\r\namong whom were included the Russians Levien and Levine, and an\r\nExecutive Council, on which were two Independents and a moderate,\r\nMaenner--an able man in charge of finance.\r\n\r\nOf course in this curious _chasser-croiser_ it is open to anyone to\r\nregard the Majoritarians as mere governmental _agents provocateurs_,\r\nworking for a premature proclamation of the Raete-Republik, with such\r\nmotives as it may suit the critic to attribute to them. This was the\r\nview taken by the _Times_; but personally I am inclined to see merely\r\nthe manoeuvring of demagogues ambitious of power, in a people with\r\nlittle political experience. To retain power, the Majoritarian\r\nSocialists of Prussia were prepared to re-introduce militarism; while\r\nthose of Bavaria were prepared to introduce \"Bolshevism\" for the same\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nBoth the course and the collapse of Munich Communism give an answer to\r\nthe question whether Russian Bolshevism can take root in Germany. If\r\nBolshevism meant Sovietism and merely is a constitutional conflict\r\nbetween parliamentary and council government, it could. There is no\r\nsuch traditional belief in the parliamentary system in Germany as to\r\nmake it an essential foundation of constitutional government. Neither\r\nthe old Berlin Reichstag nor the Weimar Assembly acquired popular\r\nconfidence. But if by Bolshevism we mean an economic class conflict\r\nconcerning the dictatorship of the proletariat, the answer seems to be\r\nthat it cannot be established in Germany, under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe short life of the Munich Commune seemed to show this. The\r\nGovernment consisted of Commissioners--a sort of inner Cabinet, an\r\nExecutive Council--a sort of Ministry, and an Assembly of\r\nCouncils--the Legislature. The first was Bolshevist, in general\r\nstandpoint, the second Independent Socialist and Moderate Communist,\r\nthe third predominantly Moderate Socialist. The Commissioners,\r\nespecially the Russians, did not enjoy the confidence of the Assembly,\r\nstill less of the garrison. I believe that they would soon have been\r\nreplaced by a Socialist _regime_, but for the military action of\r\nPrussia and Wuertemberg.\r\n\r\nNor were the measures taken by this _regime_ what could be called\r\nBolshevist. The absurd newspaper yarns, reproducing all the old\r\ncalumnies against Russian Council Government, including the\r\ncommunisation of women, gave quite a false impression. I have a\r\ncomplete list of the Communist measures, and they contain nothing very\r\nsensational and mostly existed anyway only on paper. I will give two\r\nexamples which I heard discussed before the Assembly. The _cafes\r\nchantants_, a great feature of Munich, had all been closed on moral\r\ngrounds, not without justification, as those who know Munich will\r\nadmit. The delegates of the employes appealed against this as throwing\r\nthree thousand people out of work. The debate showed that this measure\r\nwas largely a protest of the workmen against the irregular lives of\r\nthe Communist leaders themselves, and the cafes were allowed to\r\nre-open under the control of a committee of the Assembly. Further, the\r\nmiddle-class papers had been suspended by the Commissioners. So\r\nrepresentatives of the Communist and Independent papers rose to say\r\nthey would suspend publication until this prohibition was removed.\r\nThis threat was carried out and at the time I left the prohibition was\r\nabout to be repealed.\r\n\r\nAs to the practical results of the Bolshevist _regime_ it was\r\ndifficult to judge from the two or three weeks it was running; all the\r\nmore that half this time was passed in the general strike proclaimed\r\nby the Communists which they could not prevent after their accession\r\nto power. But after work was resumed it was clear that conditions were\r\nnormal. Order was not disturbed and the revolutionary tribunal as to\r\nwhich wild stories were told was a mild affair. It was even recognised\r\nby the local bar--and when an agent of the Anti-Bolshevist League was\r\ncaught with false Communist papers and large funds he was only fined\r\nthe amount in his possession. Telegraph officials, accomplices of a\r\nspy in running a secret telegraphic service to Nuremberg, were\r\nacquitted as only irresponsible agents. Russian Bolshevism would have\r\ngiven them a short shrift. The only practical difference between\r\nCommunist Munich and Independent Brunswick was that the Munich\r\nrevolutionaries not having the hearty support of the garrison had to\r\nform volunteer corps of Red Guards. These, like the Government\r\nvolunteers, were highly paid and fed, the means being provided partly\r\nby money confiscated as illegal remittances abroad, partly by printing\r\nnew notes. The extent of the attempted exportation of money may be\r\nguessed from the thousand mark note, the only convenient means of\r\nexportation, having been worth fourteen hundred marks. The removal of\r\nthe note printing presses to Bamberg embarrassed the Communists for a\r\ntime, but they had succeeded while I was there in printing twenty mark\r\nnotes, which were, of course, declared worthless by the German\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAt the time I left Munich the garrison had declared in favour of\r\nnegotiating with the expeditions menacing Munich from Augsburg and\r\nIngolstadt, and the workmen, though against negotiating with the\r\ntroops, would clearly have welcomed a peaceful solution even at the\r\ncost of expelling the Russians. This I was able to report to the\r\nPremier Hoffmann at Bamberg, whom I found under the impression that\r\nnegotiations were hopeless. Three days later, they were opened at his\r\ninvitation at Nuremberg, but led to nothing, as the workmen would not\r\nagree to disarm. The troops accordingly marched in, driving the \"red\r\narmy\" before them; and Munich, less happy in its leaders than\r\nBrunswick, became the scene of the usual sniping and skirmishing by\r\ninsurgents with machine-gunning and bombarding by the troops. The\r\ninfluence of the Russians was probably responsible for one\r\nparticularly ugly incident, the cold-blooded murder of a number of\r\n\"hostages\" in reprisal for the wholesale shooting of prisoners by the\r\ntroops. Levine, the leading member of the Russian clique, was captured\r\nand shot and several less dangerous and even quite harmless\r\nrevolutionary or Radical leaders also perished, some \"by accident.\"\r\nLevien was arrested some months later but escaped to Vienna. The new\r\nBavarian Ministry, or rather the old Bamberg Government restored, then\r\ntook on the same character as the Ministry in Berlin; that is a\r\nGovernment by military force behind a Moderate Socialist facade.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the revolution in Munich was its last effort in this\r\nfirst volume of the German revolution. The movement thereafter adopted\r\nLeipzig as its centre, an Independent stronghold; but when later the\r\nGovernment picked a quarrel with Leipzig, occupied it with troops and\r\nabolished its Independent _regime_, there was no resistance.\r\n\r\nIn this autumn of 1919 the German revolution seems hunted to death. It\r\nhas, however, only gone to ground.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Brunswick succeeded more thoroughly than any other German town in\r\nreaching the goal of the whole development of mediaeval civic life--that\r\nis the emancipation and elevation of the working class....\r\n\r\n\"The Guilds developed unusually early in Brunswick those activities\r\nwhich rendered them everywhere schools of political education and\r\ncentres of revolution. In Brunswick first of all did the workmen make\r\nhead against the Burghers. And if old records can be trusted what\r\nimmoderate ambitions appear even in their first rising in 1292. They\r\nwere not merely in revolt against abuses or for some moderate\r\nparticipation in government, but proposed nothing less than the\r\nsuppression of the old Constitution and to make themselves absolute\r\nmasters of the town.\" Chroniken der Deutschen Staedte. Braunschweig. Vol.\r\nI., p. xxvi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRUIN AND RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mistake we are all making about Germany over here, and a very\r\nnatural one, is that we can't realise what Germany to-day is like.\r\nWhile we are rapidly getting back to the material and mental\r\nconditions of pre-war days, Germany is daily getting farther and\r\nfarther away from us. It is difficult to express the difference. We\r\nall know the curious psychological change that comes over our lives\r\nwhen the doctor tells us we must \"give up\"; how then in a moment, as\r\nwe sink into bed, we are changed from responsible personalities,\r\nruling our own and others' lives, to helpless encumbrances ruled by\r\ndoctors and nurses; and how we only recover our rights through a long\r\nconvalescence. Germany has given up. It carried on until it collapsed,\r\nand now lies semi-comatose; and we, still absorbed in our quarrel,\r\nkeep pestering it with solicitors and foreclosures instead of patching\r\nit up with doctors and food. Descriptions of economic conditions in\r\nGermany must therefore be read with the realisation that they are\r\nmorbid symptoms. Germany may be, no doubt is, working its way through\r\nrevolution to a saner, sounder condition, but at present is as\r\nabnormal and helpless as a snake changing its skin. Meantime, we,\r\nusing the complete control over Europe that the war has put into our\r\nhands, have so interfered with this process as to risk making out of\r\nGermany as great a danger to the existing order in Europe as we made\r\nout of Russia.\r\n\r\nNor is the danger one of to-day only. In ten years' time when the\r\nBlockade will be no more than a memory, but when the surviving\r\nchildhood of Germany, bodily wasted and mentally warped, comes to\r\nmaturity, Europe will suffer for it. The fathers will have eaten their\r\nsour grapes by then, but the children's teeth will still be set on\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n\"I do not complain of your blockade, it ended the war,\" said to me a\r\nformer Minister and a leader of political thought. \"Yes, I've lost\r\nfour stone since I left the trenches\"--he was indeed only the\r\nframework of a once big and burly man with the low voice and languid\r\nbearing of the underfed. \"I'm all right on what I get, it's the\r\nchildren--I could give you statistics, but you wouldn't believe them;\r\nI never do. Go and see them yourself.\"\r\n\r\nSo I went. First a tour of the cellars of the great tenement houses of\r\nBerlin--cellars closed before as unfit for habitation, but now, under\r\nstress of house shortage, lived in by the large families of the German\r\nworking class. In one I find a war widow keeping five children on the\r\nbare ration: 5 lb. of potatoes, 5 lb. of bread per head a week, 1/2 lb.\r\nof meal and 1 lb. of jam when they can afford it and find it. The\r\nbigger children get a quart of skim-milk a week, too sour for anything\r\nbut soup--the younger about two quarts of full-milk. They are having\r\ntheir supper--cabbage and potatoes. The younger children nibble\r\nsuspiciously at gifts of chocolate. They do not know what it is and\r\nsuspect a new \"substitute.\" The younger children look better than the\r\nelder. The eldest boy has lost his job because he \"can't keep his\r\nfeet.\" The mother is emaciated. Next door is another family--the\r\nfather, a painter, is in work, but is continually losing days from\r\n\"stomach-trouble.\" They have lost one child from decline.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, always the same stories of struggle against decline from\r\nwant of fats or sugar, for the sugar supply failed when the Poles\r\noccupied Posen--against dirt from want of soap--against dark and\r\ncold, for the gas and coal are getting daily shorter.\r\n\r\nThen I went to a public soup kitchen where a long queue of every class\r\nwas waiting for its plate of potato-soup, just potatoes, absolutely\r\nnothing else, and they too deducted from the week's ration. \"Splendid,\r\nsplendid soup,\" says an enthusiastic little man, a small shopkeeper,\r\nperhaps, \"not a rotten potato in the whole plateful.\"\r\n\r\nThence to the creches and children's hospitals of the organisation\r\nstarted by the Empress Frederick and run for many years by English\r\nladies. In these big, bright rooms there was the same ominous quiet as\r\nin the dark cellars. \"We can keep them alive when we get them in time,\r\nbut we can't do more. We can fill them, but we can't feed them with\r\nthis,\" said the sister, ladling out potatoes and cabbage to the older\r\nchildren and oatmeal gruel to the younger. Everywhere swollen bellies\r\nand shrunken limbs--children of three that had nothing actually wrong\r\nwith them but couldn't yet stand--children with \"English sickness\" as\r\nrickets is called--children of school age that couldn't be sent to\r\nschool because they were so mentally and physically backward. Here and\r\nthere a sturdy infant that owed a better start to some stronger\r\nmother, but the most of them lying silent or wailing feebly. \"We\r\ncould save even that one,\" says the sister, unwrapping a baby so\r\nshrivelled it looked scarcely human, \"but we can get nothing, though\r\nthey give us here whatever there is. They know it's the children that\r\nmatter most now.\"\r\n\r\nChildren have always meant much to the Germans, and in those days of\r\ngrowing disgust with the past and of growing despair as to the future\r\nthey meant so much that nothing else seemed ever to matter to the\r\nwomen at any rate. I heard a woman prominent in politics say she was\r\nglad to hear that the Allies were going to occupy Essen, Duesseldorf\r\nand the industrial district, because then they must see what was\r\nhappening to the children there, owing to the blockade and to the\r\nbarring off of the milk supply from across the Rhine.\r\n\r\nI soon saw enough to be satisfied that though food could still be got\r\nat a price in the eating houses of Berlin, private households of the\r\nwhole working class and lower middle class were so straitened for food\r\nthat some members of each family were being starved; either because\r\nthey were too sickly to digest such food as could be got or because\r\nthey were giving it to the children. The same conclusion was come to\r\nby the numerous Commissions sent out to report, even though these\r\nwere generally composed of young officers; instead, as they should\r\nhave been, of experienced medical men and food experts. These\r\nCommissions were given every facility for estimating how far\r\nunder-nourishment had deteriorated the working power of the poor and\r\nwas deterring them from work. Also how far the low development and\r\nhigh death-rate of the children was due to this. And their reports\r\nshow what a terrible responsibility we assumed when we maintained the\r\nblockade after the armistice, as a means of political pressure and a\r\nmethod of penal procedure. These reports are easily accessible to\r\nEnglish readers, so I will only give here, for what they are worth,\r\nthe conclusions come to by one representative neutral and one native\r\nauthority. A Copenhagen association for studying the economic results\r\nof the war, estimated that the German population, which at the\r\nbeginning of the war was about 67.8 millions, would, but for the war,\r\nhave risen by now to about 70 millions and had sunk to about 65\r\nmillions. Of this decrease 3.5 millions was due to diminished\r\nbirth-rate and 2.1 millions to increased mortality. In the last years\r\nof war the birth-rate fell to one-half. Of the increased deaths,\r\n700,000 were ascribable to insufficient nourishment, mainly in the\r\nlast two years of war. In 1918 the death-rate for both sexes over 60\r\nincreased by half and doubled for children between 4 and 14. My\r\nobservations also suggest that it was children of this age that\r\nsuffered most from the blockade. The loss of about two millions of men\r\nin the prime of life, the decreased vitality of the women and children\r\nwho suffered especially from the blockade, and the general economic\r\nconditions of the country, make any early re-establishment of previous\r\nproductivity impossible.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift_ one, Geheimrat\r\nRuebner, compares losses by war and blockade as follows:--\r\n\r\n                       Military losses by      Civil losses\r\n                        Wounds.   Disease.     by blockade.\r\n\r\n  1st year of war       481,506     24,394        88,235\r\n  2nd   \"      \"        330,332     30,329       121,174\r\n  3rd   \"      \"        294,743     30,190       259,627\r\n  4th   \"      \"        317,954     38,167       293,700[B]\r\n  5th   \"      \"         62,417     10,902         ---\r\n                      ---------    -------      --------\r\n                      1,486,952    133,982       762,736\r\n                      ---------    -------      --------\r\n\r\nAccording to this estimate the blockade by the third year was causing\r\nalmost as heavy losses as the war itself; and a calculation on this\r\nbasis suggests that the continuance of the blockade after the\r\narmistice for six months, must have cost Germany at least 100,000\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nPresumably we intended the pressure of our blockade to ensure prompt\r\nacceptance of our peace conditions. If this was our policy, it was a\r\ndangerous mistake. A people, as docile and disciplined as the Germans,\r\nwould have accepted any terms dictated them while still under the\r\nimpression of their military defeat and of the moral derailment caused\r\nby the revolution. They would have welcomed our armies as allies in\r\nspite of the efforts to rally them made by Chauvinist or Bolshevist\r\nextremists. And nothing that a foreign State could have done was\r\nbetter calculated to make such efforts successful than the blockade\r\nand the boycott. Neither in Germany nor in Russia have we learnt that\r\nit is better to feed an idealist than to fight him. It is only those\r\nwho fast who see visions.\r\n\r\nThe food scarcity from which Germany was suffering during the six\r\nmonths I spent there, was something between the food shortage from\r\nwhich we were then emerging and the famine we were imposing on Russia.\r\nGermans were not dropping dead in the streets as they were in Russia;\r\nbut, on the other hand, Germans were not merely being restricted to a\r\nsufficient ration of simple food as were we in England. The German\r\nrations were insufficient both in quantity and quality. This was\r\nespecially the case in the essential elements of nourishment; in\r\nbread-stuffs, fats, and sugar. Bread was particularly bad; and I\r\nrealised as I never had before that if one cannot live by bread alone,\r\nbread alone is what one cannot live without. So rotten bad was the\r\nblockade bread that the staff of life became little better than a stab\r\nin the vitals. This punishment of the Prussian Prometheus should not\r\nbe overlooked when we cast up the reckoning. But how can we realise\r\nit? I remember, the day after I got back from Germany, seeing a girl\r\nin a Berkshire village come out from a baker's shop with a large piece\r\nof white bread and give it to her donkey. Three days before I would\r\nhave pulled her and her cart all round the town for that bread.\r\n\r\nDuring my first weeks in Berlin I found that I was being continually\r\nreminded of the lines of the American poet:--\r\n\r\n    The window has a little pane,\r\n      And so have I.\r\n    The window's pane is in its sash,\r\n      I wonder why.\r\n\r\nAnd after wondering why for some time I asked a doctor friend. \"Oh,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that's only the war bread. It will last some two months or\r\nso, and then you'll be all right again. If it goes on longer I'll give\r\nyou a medical certificate for invalids' bread.\" But I could not face\r\nthose two months. I used to bring bread back from Weimar, where it was\r\nbetter in quality, and after it went mouldy, boil it up into puddings.\r\nTravelling, I lived mainly off imported tins of oatmeal cooked in a\r\nstove of my own invention, for portable fuel such as petrol, spirits\r\nof wine, etc., was unprocurable. Here is the patent, which tourists on\r\nthe Continent may find useful pending the permanent peace promised us\r\nby Paris. You take a small oblong biscuit tin and cut out one end. You\r\nstand your pot or a pan on the tin, roll up a newspaper, light it and\r\nshove the lighted end into the tin, stopping it from burning too fast\r\nwith the tin lid. You can boil a kettle with a number of the\r\n_Tag-Blatt_, and the morning paper heats your porridge instead of, as\r\nusual, cooling it. I say nothing of the mental and moral advantages.\r\n\r\nAnd if the bread was deleterious, the showy-looking biscuits and cakes\r\nthat flaunted shamelessly in the shop windows were positively deadly.\r\nWhat they were made of German \"substitute\" experts alone know, but\r\nmainly, I should think, saccharine and sawdust.\r\n\r\nWhile this state of affairs was mostly due to the blockade,\r\nstatistics of German home cereal production before the war suggest\r\nthat, with anything like the increase of home production that we\r\nbrought about in England, there should have been enough to provide the\r\npopulation with wholesome bread. And Germany, both from its superior\r\nadministrative organisation and from its far larger proportion of\r\nhome-grown food, seemed likely to have done better than we did. But,\r\nboth in total production and in production per acre there was a heavy\r\nfall, amounting to as much as about 50 per cent. in such important\r\ncrops as rye and potatoes; while the slight recovery recorded in 1918\r\nwas due to a very favourable season.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason for this collapse was loss of labour power in men and\r\nanimals and of fertilisers, natural and artificial. Women in Germany\r\ndo not play the large part in field work that many of us supposed. The\r\ngreater proportion of the heavy work of cereal production was done by\r\nimmigrant labour, and for that the prisoner labour seems to have been\r\na very inadequate substitute. When this disappeared the effort to\r\ninduce unemployed to go on the land was as complete a failure as might\r\nhave been expected from our experience. To this loss of labour must be\r\nadded the loss of agricultural land in the province of Posen, now\r\noccupied by the Poles, from which Berlin and the Saxon industrial\r\ndistricts drew their grain and potatoes. Thereafter the potato ration\r\nin Leipzig was for some time reduced from 5 lb. to 2 lb. weekly.\r\n\r\nThe importation of flour from America made at first little difference.\r\nIt cost far too much and came to far too little. Meat was nearly\r\nalways procurable at a price, and, if one knew where to go, was good\r\nenough. And for a hundred marks or so, equivalent to five pounds at\r\nthe pre-war rate of money, quite a decent dinner could be got in\r\nselect restaurants.[C]\r\n\r\nThe organisation of food supply was distinctly good. The conditions in\r\nGermany were indeed far more difficult than in England. Instead of\r\nhaving merely to control the importation at the main ports in Germany\r\nthe supply had to be controlled before it left the hands of the\r\nindividual farmer. This could, of course, only be done on broad\r\nlines. The system followed was to divide the country up into\r\nadministrative areas corresponding to the local governments and\r\nroughly to apportion the supply of food products to the population.\r\nThis resulted in certain areas becoming surplus and others deficit\r\nregions; and the surplus regions were then compelled to supply a\r\ncertain proportion of their abundance to their less fortunate\r\nneighbours. But, of course, no control, however meticulous, could\r\nprevent rural districts from feeding full before anything went to the\r\nindustrial districts, or could stop illicit trading between the\r\nwell-to-do and the farmers. This \"schleich-handel\" or sneak trade kept\r\nthe profiteer well supplied throughout the war with farm produce.\r\nAfter the revolution this profiteers' sneak trade was supplemented by\r\na proletariat sneak trade, in which plundered stores were hawked\r\nthrough the poor quarters by broken soldiers and miscellaneous\r\nbrigands. In Berlin, round the Alexanderplatz, there was perpetual\r\nskirmishing between these \"wild traders\" and the patrols of the\r\nFrei-Corps. The efforts to suppress the sneak trade of the well-to-do\r\nclasses supporting the Government were not so drastic. Butter could\r\ngenerally be bought through the hotel waiters at forty marks a pound.\r\n\r\nThere was noticeable in all this a marked deficiency of public spirit in\r\nrespect to private life. The German has for so long been drilled and\r\ndragooned in his public life that his civic conscience is little\r\ndeveloped. Whereas in England one had the impression that the government\r\nand authorities, and especially the army, were the worst offenders\r\nagainst national economy and the mass of the middle class the most\r\nconscientious, in Germany it seemed quite the other way. Undoubtedly one\r\nof the irritants that excited the revolution was the failure of the\r\nrationing system to secure an equitable distribution--or anything more\r\nthan a minimum of certain staple foods.\r\n\r\nThis food shortage is, of course, a cause as well as a consequence of\r\nthe economic collapse of Germany. German economic life, swept away for\r\nyears on the tide of war effort, now revolves round and round in a\r\nvicious circle like a dead carcase in an eddy after a flood. Famine\r\nand fighting have made the people too weak and too weary to work; but\r\nuntil they work they cannot get food from abroad or grow it at home.\r\nThat is the economic vicious circle. The boycott and blockade have\r\nmade the people too restless and revolutionary to reconstruct and\r\nremodel their constitutional institutions; and until they do so they\r\nare to be boycotted and embargoed. That is the political vicious\r\ncircle in foreign affairs. In all regions of economic life one finds\r\nthis endless chain of cause and effect revolving round Paris and\r\nfettering such energies as are left to Germany.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for an estimate of the material sacrifices we\r\nhave made and are making, so as to coerce Germany into accepting the\r\npeace conditions of Paris and into suppressing its own revolutionary\r\nmovements. I would only point out that a brisk trade between France\r\nand Germany was proceeding all through these months of blockade. For\r\nexample, an acquaintance in Switzerland who wanted in February a\r\ncertain well-known make of French tyre was told by his garage that\r\nthey could get them cheaper than in France if he did not mind where\r\nthey came from. They came via Germany. And no sooner was the Treaty\r\nsigned than a swarm of American agents descended on Berlin, buying up\r\nbusinesses right and left, as also such stocks as were left. Small\r\nwonder, with the mark at one-quarter its pre-war value. As to _objets\r\nd'art_ and paintings, the ruin of the plutocracy and the low rate of\r\nexchange threaten to strip Germany far more effectively than any\r\nGerman raiders could strip the villas of France and Belgium. But in\r\nthis legitimate indemnity we English have not benefited. We are too\r\nmuch afraid of \"dumping,\" no doubt.\r\n\r\nThere are still probably many in England who fear that German\r\ncompetition will begin immediately with the raising of the blockade.\r\nApart from the political and social conditions that make impossible an\r\nearly convalescence of German industry from its complete collapse, the\r\nfollowing official data taken from the preface to new regulations for\r\nthe textile industry, show the conditions to which this industry was\r\nreduced before the revolution. This document it may be noted, is not\r\none prepared for foreign consumption.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of war German industry had a stock of 300,000 bales of\r\ncotton on hand, and as much more was held by the Bremen merchants. And\r\nas much more again was imported up to the breach with Italy in May,\r\n1915. The stock then was 600,000 bales. During the war 200,000 bales\r\nwere seized in Belgium and Poland. This supply allowed the German\r\nmills an output of 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. of their annual peace\r\noutput of about a million tons. The annual local wool production\r\nduring the war was 7,000 tons, flax 20,000 tons, hemp 11,000 tons,\r\nartificial wool 25,000 tons, and artificial cotton from rags, etc.,\r\n33,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAttempts to grow cotton substitutes were a failure. Nettle fibre in\r\n1916 amounted to 200 tons, turf fibre 2,000 tons, reed fibre 1,000\r\ntons. Artificial fabrics (stapel-fasser), on the other hand, rose to\r\nan annual amount of 10,000 tons, and seem to have a future. Paper\r\nthread rose to 150,000 tons annually, but is only a war expedient. The\r\nhome production of fibre was about 2 per cent. of the previous\r\nimportation.\r\n\r\nThese official figures show that the arrears now required are such\r\nthat if they could be supplied they could not be paid for. A value of\r\nabout five milliards is required as compared with a value of 1-1/2\r\nmilliards imported before the war, and 5 milliards is about the total\r\nvalue of all raw material imported annually before the war. The only\r\nprospect of supply otherwise is from home-made artificial fibres, and\r\nthat only if they are protected against foreign cotton, which is\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nAll the proposals now under discussion for improving methods of\r\nproduction by co-ordinating and controlling the factories even if\r\nfeasible and effective will not, in the opinion of competent persons\r\nhere, make up for any material proportion of the loss of productive\r\npower due to present conditions both of capital and labour. They wish\r\nto get this and other industries restarted, not with any prospect of\r\nprofit, but to provide clothing and work for the industrial\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the economic policy of the Treaty is ever realised and\r\nwe artificially stimulate the production of Germany and strangle its\r\nconsumption, we shall, if the country recovers, and is resigned to\r\nwork under such conditions, run a real danger of a dumping of a most\r\ndangerous character. The semi-servile employment of the Germans could\r\nunder such conditions be used to fight the efforts of our workmen for\r\neconomic freedom; just as the semi-servile enlistment of Hessians and\r\nHanoverians was used to fight the efforts of our American colonies for\r\npolitical freedom. But this policy, if policy it is, depends on\r\nwhether and when Germany is sufficiently recovered to work again.\r\n\r\nWhen we measure the exhaustion of Germany on the one side against the\r\nenormity of its burdens on the other, it is difficult to believe that\r\nit can ever recover in the near future. German economic life has had\r\nto endure three crushing blows--the war, the revolution, and the\r\npeace. It was financially ruined by the war, industrially ruined by\r\nthe revolution, and economically ruined by the peace terms. Little\r\nneed be said as to the financial ruin caused by the war. In its\r\ngeneral lines it is the same as that suffered by all belligerent\r\npeoples; in its details it would require a book to itself. War losses\r\nreduced the industrial, agricultural, and mental producing power of\r\nthe male population by about a fifth, which may well be doubled to\r\ncover the reduced productivity of the remainder due to physical anaemia\r\nand political agitation. The productivity of the soil was reduced by\r\nover a quarter, owing to want of labour and fertilisers. Livestock was\r\nreduced by two-thirds. Deadstock, including industrial plant, railway\r\nrolling stock, shipping, buildings, etc., was all much more reduced in\r\nvalue than with us, owing to the greater material concentration of\r\nGermany on its war effort. The State was bankrupt even in the opinion\r\nof the most optimistic. But all this was remediable, even rapidly\r\nremediable, as soon as the people recovered their vitality. And then\r\ncame the armistice which for nine months blockaded and bled the\r\npatient. If one were to enquire which of the particular bleedings most\r\ncontributed to his relapse into his present condition of coma one\r\nwould choose the taking away of the 5,000 locomotives. The tie up of\r\ninternal transportation that followed did more than anything else to\r\ninjure the economic vitality of the country.\r\n\r\nGerman unity was economic rather than political in its origin and\r\ndates from the Zollverein and the railway system. Germany was made a\r\nnation economically by railway construction in the '`forties'; though,\r\nunfortunately, the attempt to realise this unity politically on a\r\nliberal basis, in 1848, failed. Even in the present Constitution, we\r\ncan recognise the degree to which the railways are relied on for\r\nbinding the country together across the mediaeval barriers of\r\nprovincial frontiers. It was to some extent realisation of its\r\npolitical importance that made the German railway system the pride of\r\nthe country; and it was the manner in which this system met the\r\nextraordinary demands of modern warfare that enabled Germany to\r\nexploit strategically to the full its internal position and fight a\r\nwar on four fronts. And now the condition of the railways is a\r\nstriking illustration of the economic and political conditions of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHere is an account of a journey from Berlin to Munich undertaken last\r\nEaster.\r\n\r\nIn peace time, if you wanted to go to Munich from Berlin there were\r\nhalf a dozen trains daily which did the journey in seven or eight\r\nhours, and provided reading cars, eating cars, and sleeping cars at a\r\nrate no more than an English third-class fare. Even after the war one\r\ntrain daily only took eighteen hours, and the second-class carriages,\r\nthough very crowded, were comfortable enough. So, when I was warned\r\nthat if I wanted to see the Russian Communist _regime_ in Munich at\r\nwork I must lose no time, it seemed worth spending Easter week\r\nexamining whether Russian Bolshevism can take root in Germany. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I got just twenty-four hours in Munich, the rest of\r\nthe week going in travelling.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty was a strike of bank clerks, so that I had to\r\nleave short of money. The next was that owing to the coal strike all\r\npassenger trains in Saxony had stopped running, and the only route\r\nopen was round by Frankfort. The Spa night express was, of course,\r\nrunning; a long train of sleepers for the Allied officers and official\r\nor officious personages, and a few ordinary carriages. Thanks to some\r\nBritish Tommies, for whom a first-class carriage was reserved, failing\r\nto turn up, I got a seat, and so comfortably enough to Cassel about\r\ndawn. There I found that the suspension of passenger traffic had been\r\nextended, and that a hundred miles of dead country lay between me and\r\nWuertemberg, where trains still ran. Fortunately, a party of prisoners\r\nfrom England were being sent south on a goods train, and I got leave\r\nfrom the Red Guard to join them. The station officials objected\r\nstrongly, but the prisoners, some of whom had been reading _The Daily\r\nNews_, overruled them.\r\n\r\nAnd so, bumping slowly along on a wooden bench all day, discussing,\r\ncooking and card-playing with the prisoners, past stations with names\r\nreminiscent of pre-war high living. Leaving the goods yard at\r\nFrankfort about ten that night, I was lucky enough to run across a\r\nmotor-bus just starting for Darmstadt, in Wuertemberg, and got there\r\nabout one in the morning with a jolly party of South Germans. Three\r\nhours on a waiting-room bench, and then at dawn on Easter Monday a\r\ntrain south into Baden, and then from Heidelberg east through\r\nWuertemberg.\r\n\r\nAll this country seemed to have suffered little from the war and to be\r\nwonderfully happy and prosperous. The change came again in the\r\nafternoon after crossing the Bavarian frontier and climbing slowly up\r\non to the Swabian plateau. Down in Baden it was full spring, with\r\nfruit trees in bloom and warm sunshine. Here was winter, a bitter east\r\nwind and snow flurries, bare uplands and dark pine woods.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Ulm were the first signs of the winter of discontent,\r\nsome telegraph poles sawn through. And finally, just when a bed at\r\nAugsburg after two nights up seemed assured, we were all turned out\r\nabout eleven at night at a miserable Swabian village called\r\nDinckelscherben. There was fighting in Augsburg and all access to the\r\ntown was barred by the Wuertemberg troops there.\r\n\r\nIt was freezing hard, with a bitter wind, and I joined a forlorn party\r\nof some score travellers who wandered about knocking vainly at the\r\ndoors of the big farms that made up the village--no Swabian farmer\r\nopens to a stranger at midnight these days. The only beerhouse was\r\npacked two deep with travellers from an earlier train, but took in the\r\nwomen on our threatening to storm it. The rest started off to tramp\r\nthe rails to Augsburg, seventeen miles away; but as this meant\r\nabandoning my provisions I broke into a hayloft and bested the rude\r\nSwabian boor. The bauer by daylight was somewhat less of a Swab and\r\ngave me milk for my porridge, the first I had had for three months. He\r\nalso produced at a price a queer little shay, with a half-broken\r\nUkrainian, swerving erratically about beside a long pole, in which I\r\ndrove over the plateau to Augsburg, getting there about noon.\r\n\r\nComing in to Oberhausen, the workmen's quarter, there were all the\r\nusual signs of trouble--deserted streets, bullet-starred walls, and\r\nbroken windows. The street was blocked by a crowd that was being\r\naddressed by a speaker, from a window. The shay was surrounded by men\r\narmed with rifles and bombs; and half-starved Bavarian workmen,\r\nwithout sleep for days and fighting against odds, made an ugly looking\r\ncrowd. They were not at first satisfied with my papers; said they, \"If\r\nyou are an English _genosse_ make us a speech and if it's all right\r\nwe'll let you through, if not--\" It was a severer _viva voce_ than I'd\r\nhad for the Diplomatic Service, but I passed, and some of the elder\r\nmen escorted the shay through the lines for fear of accidents. They\r\npromised not to draw fire from the Government machine-guns until we\r\nwere across and the Wuertemberg outpost was safely reached.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon was spent in Augsburg, the base of the Wuertemberg\r\nExpeditionary Force, and the next stage was the fifty miles of road to\r\nMunich. No motor would go for fear of being confiscated by the\r\nCommunists, and in all Augsburg there was only one fly with a pair of\r\nhorses that could do it. It asked L20 for the round trip, about four\r\ntimes what I had with me. However, having bought an option on the fly,\r\nI had a monopoly of the transport to Munich, and had only to float a\r\ncompany. A merchant, an officer in mufti, probably a spy, and a\r\ncharming lady in the dress of the Red Cross took the other three seats\r\nat L5 each, and I had still the seats for the return journey. These\r\neventually brought a handsome profit that I divided between the\r\nAnti-Bolshevist League and the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations, and finding out what was happening in Augsburg,\r\ntook the afternoon, and at dawn next morning we started over the\r\nrolling uplands for Munich. Outside Bruck we came on a score or so of\r\nRed Guards bivouacking in a barn, and nearer Munich passed through\r\nseveral pickets which searched for weapons, but gave no trouble. And\r\nso about two in the afternoon of Wednesday into Munich, having left\r\nBerlin Saturday evening.\r\n\r\nThe return journey was better. I had intended to leave Munich by the\r\ncarriage for Augsburg on Friday, but on Thursday afternoon I heard the\r\ntwo parties had agreed to let a special train run for Munich merchants\r\nexhibiting at the Leipzig Fair. Having done nearly all that I came\r\nfor, this chance was not to be missed. So I paid Levien, the Communist\r\nCommissioner, a farewell visit, and got a special permit from him to\r\ngo by the Leipzig train. Leaving Munich about four with a train load\r\nof Munich merchants and their assistants, we went very slowly round by\r\nLandshut to Nuremberg, with nothing more sensational than searches for\r\narms first by Red then by White Guards. The special arrived at\r\nNuremberg about dawn, and was to wait six hours there; so finding a\r\ntrain was leaving for Bamberg, the seat of the Hoffmann Government, I\r\nwent on there, and spent the morning in the picturesque old town, then\r\nthe \"Weimar\" of Bavaria. Like Weimar, the station was barricaded, and\r\na pass was required to enter the town. Like Weimar, the town was worth\r\nentering, for food was plentiful.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the Premier, I got back to pick up the Leipzig special.\r\nBut the railway officials had other views, and there was no Red Guard\r\nto overrule them. My Communist permit was useless, and there was no\r\ntime to get one from the Bamberg Government. So I had to see the\r\nspecial steam out. This might have meant a day's delay, as Bavarian\r\npassenger traffic was by now also suspended, the Bohemian coal having\r\nbeen cut off. I was lucky in getting on in a wooden box hitched on to\r\na regular dachshund of a goods train, it was so long and slow. It\r\ncrawled gasping up into the Thuringer Wald, and there after dark ten\r\nmiles from anywhere lay down with no sign of life but an occasional\r\nsigh. After some hours a Prussian engine came down, and pulled it over\r\nthe ridge, and we got clear of Bavaria at Probstcella about midnight.\r\n\r\nHere there was a great row between the Prussian and Bavarian\r\nrailwaymen. The Prussians complaining the Bavarians kept them up to\r\nall hours by being always late and the Bavarians saying it was the bad\r\ncoal the Prussians sent them. Our small party, headed by some Bavarian\r\nofficers, profited, because we backed the Bavarians, who in return\r\ninsisted on our being taken on with the train. Behind the Prussian\r\nengine we developed a surprising turn of speed, and rattled along\r\nexpecting at every station to be turned out or shunted until we got\r\ninto the main line at Halle. A judicious change at a way station into\r\na passenger train that overtook us, and three hours' standing up in a\r\ncarriage with fourteen people, a large dog, two goats, and a baby,\r\nbrought me to Berlin about two on Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\nNor was this a unique experience. On my last journey home the\r\nlocomotive broke down and had to be changed three times before we got\r\nto Hanover.\r\n\r\nA German train with its immense but impotent engine, its ponderous but\r\ndilapidated carriages, its officials once resplendent and arrogant,\r\nnow servile and seedy, its groaning crawl from one breakdown to\r\nanother, is a painful picture of the German State.\r\n\r\nAnd the financial position of the State railways is illustrative of\r\nthe condition of State finances. Before the war the Prussian State\r\nRailways contributed to the budget a surplus of 600 million marks--now\r\nthey show a deficit of 2,000 millions.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals between the crisis of its internal convulsions\r\nGermany worries feebly about its finances, much as a merchant in\r\nmortal illness may worry about his bankruptcy. But, of course, nothing\r\nhas been done or could be done because the business was still closed\r\nand the chief creditor had not yet filed his claim. Now we know what\r\nParis expects Germany to pay, and we also know something of the\r\nfinancial position from the statements of the Finance Ministers,\r\nSchiffer, Dernburg, and Erzberger.\r\n\r\nThe German debt before the war was an annual charge of 230 million\r\nmarks, the peace expenditure excluding the army 200 millions. The war\r\ndebt in December, 1918, was 146 milliards, increased in January by 3.5\r\nmilliards, in February by 2.7 milliards, in March by 2 milliards and\r\nestimated to increase further by 1-1/2 milliards per month on an average\r\nfor the coming financial year. To this must be added 1/2 milliard for\r\ncost of expropriations, 4-1/2 milliards for reconstruction of ravaged\r\nterritories in Prussia, 1-1/2 milliards for compensation of German\r\nshipowners, separation allowance subsidies to the German States,\r\netc., in all 185 milliards about, with an annual charge of 10\r\nmilliards. Reduction of this item by total or partial repudiation of\r\nthis debt, though advocated by the Opposition, is impossible without\r\ncausing economic ruin and political revolution. The new army is\r\nestimated to require 2 milliards; about the same as before the war,\r\nbecause of the enormously exaggerated expense of this small volunteer\r\nforce compared with the old conscript army. If, to the great political\r\nadvantage of Germany, a Swiss militia were substituted for the\r\nFrei-Corps, this item could be halved easily. The estimate of 4-1/2\r\nmilliards for pensions is the same as that of France and will probably\r\nbe exceeded, though as yet less than half that is being paid. This\r\nmakes up a total annual estimated expenditure of 17,429 million marks,\r\nthe mark at pre-war exchange being equal to a shilling.\r\n\r\nAs Herr Erzberger's speech on the Budget showed, he is faced by a\r\nfinancial position unparalleled in the history of national\r\nbankruptcies. The interest which he has to find on the Imperial debt\r\namounts by itself to Mk. 10 milliard; and his total annual\r\nrequirements, exclusive of the Allies' demands under the Peace Treaty,\r\nare estimated at Mk. 25 milliard. Before the war the revenue from\r\nImperial taxation was under Mk. 2 milliard. Additional taxation\r\nimposed during the war yields about Mk. 4 milliard. To-day therefore\r\nGermany is faced with an annual expenditure of Mk. 25 milliard and an\r\nannual revenue of Mk. 6 milliard--_i.e._, an annual deficit of Mk. 19\r\nmilliard, nearly ten times greater than the whole revenue of 1913. The\r\nnew taxes actually proposed are estimated to bring in about Mk. 2\r\nmilliard. But the main sources upon which the Finance Minister is\r\ngoing to rely are two: a levy on capital and a tax on sales. The levy\r\nestablishes a graded tax on all property, starting at 10 per cent. and\r\nreaching a maximum of 63.9 per cent. Payment may be made by\r\ninstalments spread over 30 years, and it is estimated that the tax\r\nwill bring in about Mk. 4 milliard annually. The tax on sales is still\r\nmore drastic. It really consists of three different taxes: (1) a\r\ngeneral tax of 1 per cent. on all sales, (2) a tax of 5 per cent. on\r\nretail trade, (3) a tax on the producer of luxuries of 10 per cent.,\r\nand on retail trade in luxuries of 15 per cent. This tax is estimated\r\nto bring in about Mk. 3 milliard. But even after this raid on the\r\nowners of property and upon capital, the unfortunate Minister of\r\nFinance is faced with a deficit of Mk. 10 milliard. He proposes to\r\nget Mk. 2-1/2 milliard out of beer, petroleum, stamps, flour and meat,\r\nand the remainder, Mk. 7-1/2 milliard out of a uniform income tax for\r\nthe whole country and an excess profits tax.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of these sums can be estimated when it is remembered\r\nthat the total incomes of all Prussians earning more than a pound a\r\nweek only amounts to 19 milliards, and that Helfferich's estimate of\r\nthe pre-war income of all Germany was 315 milliards. But that was a\r\nvery different Germany from the present. Germany has lost a greater\r\npart of its mineral wealth, the coal of the Saar, the potash of\r\nAlsace, the ores of Luxembourg. She has lost her colonies with their\r\ngreat potential wealth. She has also lost her fleet and a great part\r\nof her railway material. Over a million and a-half, or 16 per cent. of\r\nthe male working population are dead. Industry has neither the capital\r\nnor the energy to reconvert itself to peace productivity. Much of the\r\ncapital left is either concealed or has been carried abroad. German\r\nholdings of foreign securities were estimated at twenty milliards\r\nbefore the war and not more than one milliard now. Over a milliard of\r\nthe gold reserve at the Deutsche Bank has been paid for foreign\r\nprovisions, leaving only a milliard and a-half to cover a note issue\r\nof thirty milliards.\r\n\r\nGermany must by March, 1921, deliver up all payment in kind, _i.e._,\r\ngoods, ships, coal, etc., which might possibly exceed the total of\r\nL800,000,000 provided by the Treaty. On the other hand, Germany must\r\npay the pensions due to disabled soldiers and the relatives of the\r\nfallen, which in the case of France alone amounted to L8,000,000,000.\r\nIn all, Germany is liable for a sum of L15,400,000,000, which should\r\nbe paid off in a period of thirty-six years. For the two first years\r\nafter the war she will pay nothing, but subsequently she must pay\r\nL554,000,000, with interest at 5 per cent. The total amount paid by\r\nGermany will therefore amount to L18,520,000,000 at the end of\r\nthirty-six years.\r\n\r\nAnd most serious loss of all--she has lost for a time, anyway, all\r\nwill to work. Improvement in food and general conditions of life will\r\ndo something for this, socialisation of industry and introduction of\r\nthe Council system would do more, but it will take time. Even if\r\nGermany obtained at once a return of energy, a reopening of markets, a\r\nre-entry of raw material and a free recourse to foreign capital, and\r\nshe will have to wait long for all of these, even so it seems very\r\ndoubtful whether she could make a living under such a load of debt.\r\nThis will mean the emigration of from ten to twenty million Germans in\r\nthe course of the next few years, to the West if it is open to them,\r\nbut otherwise to the East. Germany will, in fact, be brought down to\r\nthe political and economic conditions of Portugal.\r\n\r\nWe pursued this policy of ruining Germany for a century because we\r\nwere still under the impression of animosities and anxieties that\r\nbelonged to war conditions. Our attitude was that the Allies should\r\nget what they could out of Germany while they could; and if the\r\nattempt ruined Germany, Germany had deserved it.\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude that prevailed during the armistice period. But\r\nthe Peace of Versailles has inaugurated a more systematic and\r\nfar-reaching exploitation. This is no place to review its economic and\r\nfinancial provisions; but no one could read them without realising\r\nthat our policy is apparently to make Germany work for us as its\r\nbankers, brokers, shippers and creditors with unlimited claims. To\r\ntake a rake-off as merchants and middlemen from all German\r\nmanufactures and to set up a receivership over Germany that we call a\r\nReparation Commission, with the right to claim any remaining profit.\r\nThe powers of this receivership are such as to prevent the development\r\nof any German competition with us in the conduct or control of German\r\nproduction. Combined with the claims for damages these powers would,\r\nindeed, make all government impossible. For example, under them\r\nGermany is liable to pay the pension claims of the dependents of\r\nSikhs, Senegalese or South Carolina negroes to the exclusion of its\r\nown wounded and widows. But the policy, in so far as a compilation of\r\nthe unchecked schedules and uncriticised schemes of war profiteers can\r\nbe said to have a policy, is that of making the German workmen produce\r\nfor British Big Business. The functions ascribed to the so-called\r\n\"Reparation Commission\" represent an attempt to make the German\r\nproletariat work under foreign exploitation. Experiments in foreign\r\nfinancial control we have had in Eastern Europe, with semi-civilised\r\npeoples; but this is an attempt to set up foreign economic control\r\nover a people which in industry had won for itself the first place in\r\nEurope. At first sight one is inclined to reject this policy as a\r\npractical impossibility; but so extreme is the debility of Germany,\r\nand so exceptional the docility of the people, that I am inclined to\r\nthink it might have had some temporary and partial success but for one\r\nthing--the Council movement and the demands of the workmen for the\r\nsocialisation of industry.\r\n\r\nWithout some measure of socialisation of industry, without some\r\nmeasure of political representation through Councils, the unemployed\r\nwill not return to work and the employed will only work in fitful\r\nintervals between strikes.\r\n\r\nBetween the November revolution and the end of February the coalminers\r\nalone forfeited 23 million marks of wages in more or less meaningless\r\nstrikes; and this was before the great strikes of the spring, which\r\nhad an obvious political purpose. This is three times the loss\r\nincurred in the last pre-war strike of 1912. The decrease in\r\nproduction rose from a quarter-million tons in December to a million\r\nin February, and this was little compared with the loss that followed,\r\nestimated at no less than ten million tons.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of 1919 there were always at least a\r\nmillion and a half workmen drawing an unemployment pay of about\r\ntwo-thirds of their average wage.[D] Add to this outlay that of the\r\nforce raised to prevent the workmen from realising their\r\nrevolution--the seven hundred thousand Frei-Corps, engaged at such a\r\nhigh pay that this Prussian volunteer force of to-day is budgeted for\r\nat the same total as the vast German armies that dominated Europe\r\nbefore the war. It is curious that Germany should now be paying the\r\nsame amount to terrorise a few working quarters that it paid five\r\nyears ago to terrorise the world. And the second attempt is as\r\nhopeless as the first, for the revolution will not be denied. Even the\r\nbureaucratic Social-Democrats of the present Government recognise this\r\nand try to placate it with words.\r\n\r\n\"Socialisation has come,\" proclaim the Government posters all over\r\nBerlin, and when I was in Berlin I thought I'd see if I could find it.\r\nFirst, I went to the special department responsible, where in a\r\ncommandeered hotel I was introduced by a charming lady typist to an\r\nequally charming temporary official. He was an enthusiastic alpinist,\r\nand asked affectionately after my brother and other English climbers;\r\nand, finally, with the help of the typist we unearthed some pamphlets\r\nand propaganda leaflets. It was quite a shock on leaving to find\r\noneself in the Wilhelmstrasse, not in Whitehall. Then I tried\r\nWestminster--I mean Weimar--where I found two Government Bills being\r\nshoved through in a great hurry, because the Socialist supporters of\r\nthe Government had, like me, been investigating what was behind the\r\nposters and pamphlets, and had found only brick walls and bureaucrats.\r\n\r\nAnd to what does it all amount? Practically nothing, except as regards\r\nthe coal industry, and so far rather less than nothing there. But the\r\ncourse of events is instructive and particularly interesting for us.\r\n\r\nThe German coal industry, even more than ours, has in the last\r\nquarter-century become a monopoly under control of great capitalist\r\ncombines. Their power is not affected either by the State-owned\r\nPrussian mines or by any possibility of new coalfields, as these are\r\neither held in reserve by the combines or are too unremunerative to\r\ncompete. Already before the war this monopoly had been recognised by\r\nall parties as not in the public interest; but \"nationalisation\" in\r\nthe sense of State exploitation was prejudiced by the poor results\r\ngiven by the State-owned properties of the Saar fields.\r\n\r\nThis inferiority was due not to inferior industry on the part of the\r\nworkmen but to inferior initiative and independence in the management.\r\nWhat effect over-papered, under-paid officialdom can have on the\r\nproductiveness of a coalfield is shown in the following annual\r\npercentages of total production:\r\n\r\n            Westphalia.    Silesia.    Saar.\r\n  Year.      Private.      Private.    State.\r\n  1860         26.6         24.7        19.5\r\n  1880         53.0         23.8        12.6\r\n  1890         55.2         26.2         9.4\r\n  1910         59.9         24.4         9.3\r\n  1913         60.2         22.8         8.9\r\n\r\nBut with the revolution came an alternative to\r\n\"nationalisation\"--\"socialisation\"--in which all those connected with\r\nthe coal industry should have an interest in it. An autonomous guild\r\nmight preserve initiative and energy; while the interest of the\r\nconsumer and of the community might be safeguarded by representation\r\nin the Guild and by State supervision.\r\n\r\nA beginning was made towards such a solution in regulations, passed in\r\nthe first months of the revolution, recognising the functions of the\r\nWorkmen's Councils and attempting to reconcile their activities with\r\nexpert administration and official supervision. No progress was,\r\nhowever, made by Weimar during the spring in this practical process of\r\nworking through a sort of Whitley Council system to a sort of Guild\r\nSocialism; and the general strike of March found the Government with\r\nnothing in particular to which it could refer its critics.\r\n\r\nAccordingly two Acts were hurriedly run through the Assembly. One, the\r\n\"Socialisation Bill,\" recorded the right of the citizen to employment\r\nor to support (amended to reserve \"personal liberty\")--the right of\r\nthe State to socialise all economic enterprises (restricted by\r\namendment to cases of urgent necessity and adequate compensation)--the\r\nadministration of socialised industries by autonomous guilds--(amended\r\nto include the State or other Government authorities). And from this\r\nit will be seen that an Act intended to establish general\r\n\"socialisation\" in principle, on a basis of expropriation was amended\r\ninto one contemplating \"nationalisation\" in urgent cases, with\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nA clause in this Act required immediate application of the principle\r\nof socialisation to coal mines, and a Coal Bill has accordingly also\r\nbeen passed. By this the State takes over the industry and entrusts it\r\nto a Coal Board, reserving the right to regulate prices. Nothing is\r\nsaid as to the composition of this Board, but nothing is changed in\r\nthe proprietary basis of the industry further than its organisation in\r\nregional syndicates.\r\n\r\nThere is also to be an Expert Council, representing employers,\r\nworkmen, and officials equally. The retail coal trade remains\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nAs to \"Socialisation\" generally, the reports of the Socialisation\r\nCommission have all been rejected and the Commission, that last relic\r\nof the revolution, resigned as long ago as May. The recommendations of\r\nWissels, an active Minister, had as little success and he resigned in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe Government had promised that socialisation was to be established\r\nin the Constitution; but Art. 156 of the Constitution does no more\r\nthan give the State the power to \"socialise\" and syndicalise industry,\r\nwhile Art. 155 says that private royalties are to be legislatively\r\ntransferred to the State.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in spite of plaintive posters, it is not communistic\r\nsocialisation, but capitalistic syndicalisation, that has been\r\nintroduced in Germany. While loudly proclaiming a step forward, the\r\nGovernment has taken a long stride back.[E]\r\n\r\n\"Socialisation\" has not as yet affected the economic basis of the\r\nPrussianism that we have been fighting. This basis was a coalition\r\nbetween the old political interest of the landed proprietors and the\r\nnew political interest of the captains of industry, or, to express it\r\nshortly, between the Junkers and the Jews. The free trade and\r\nliberalism that kept Great Britain from \"Prussianism\" in spite of the\r\npower retained by a few feudal families and the landed gentry was due\r\nto the different relationship in England between the upper and middle\r\nclasses. In England our \"Junkers\" and \"Jews\" coalesced during our\r\ngreat industrial development, perhaps because our upper class had\r\nalready more Jews than Junkers. In Germany they remained apart but\r\ncombined for their own interests. We have seen to what extent the\r\nrevolution has threatened the economic authority of the captain of\r\nindustry--the industrial profiteer. Is the feudal landed proprietor\r\nalso threatened?\r\n\r\nThe first effort of the revolution further east in Russia, Hungary and\r\nthe Baltic States has been to \"socialise\" land. Either, where the\r\nagricultural industry is primitive, as in Russia, by simply dividing\r\nup the land among the peasants, or where it is progressive, as in the\r\nmodel-farm estates of Hungary, by putting the estate under control of\r\na council of workers as though it was a factory. But in Germany the\r\nurban character of the revolution, which has accounted for the\r\ncomparative ease with which the Government have coerced it, is shown\r\nby land tenure being as yet little affected. The only definite action\r\nagainst the large landed estates, that I know of, is a measure of the\r\nPrussian Assembly postponing action until 1921. This characteristic\r\nprocrastination is, of course, explained to the revolutionaries as\r\nmerely allowing a short period for voluntary breaking up of the big\r\nestates, and to the reactionaries as a postponement of all action.\r\nMeantime financial conditions in Germany are quite as favourable to\r\nthe dispersal of large estates as with us; for wherever the farming\r\nsystem obtains the farmers have made even larger fortunes in Germany\r\nthan in England. But the system of landed tenure is much more varied\r\nin Germany. There is a large proportion of freeholders and\r\ncopyholders, while big estates are farmed by bailiffs with hired\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nIn the region of these big estates--the land of the Junker\r\n(Mecklenburg, Pomerania and Brandenburg)--the revolution is openly\r\ndefied. The agrarians of these regions not long ago had a regular\r\ntrial of strength with the present _regime_, and though worsted were\r\nnone the worse.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the German revolution is in labour, its weakness is in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] To end of 1918.\r\n\r\n[C] The advertisement columns of the daily papers, those most\r\ntrustworthy of documents, told many a tale of distress.

How far these are being at present enforced I\r\ndo not know.\r\n\r\nUnemployment provision--regulations of 13th November and 15th January.\r\nThe cost is borne one-half by the Reich, one-third by the State and\r\none-sixth by the locality. The rates must be reduced by April, 1919, to\r\na maximum of six marks per day. It can be withdrawn on refusal to work\r\nfor insufficient reasons.\r\n\r\nEmployment regulations of 4th and 25th January. Previous employes on\r\ndemobilisation must be re-employed and persons employed in their absence\r\nonly discharged under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nLegislative regulations of labour. An order of 12th November, 1918,\r\nrestored to force all sanitary and social regulations and restrictions\r\nsuspended during the war.\r\n\r\nLabour disputes. Settlement regulated by order of 23rd December, 1918,\r\nwhich sets up workmen's committees responsible for questions of wages,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nProhibition of night baking, 23rd November, 1918.\r\n\r\nPrevention of venereal diseases, 11th and 17th December. This measure\r\npenalises with three years' imprisonment those exposing others to\r\ninfection even ignorantly and prescribes compulsory medical attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom its present position and at its present pace the Weimar\r\nParliament will never overtake events. I remember once as a boy\r\npointing out to a cavalcade in red coats jogging along a by-lane that\r\nthe hunt was off in a different direction.\r\n\r\n\"The hounds, you mean,\" said an old gentleman severely; \"we are the\r\nhunt,\" and they all jogged happily on.\r\n\r\nMeantime the dogs of war--of civil war between the constitutional and\r\ncouncil movements, between Conservatives and Communists--are still\r\nrunning at a fearful pace and quite out of hand. The workmen will not\r\nwork unless some real socialisation is introduced, and this is only\r\npossible if more steam be brought into the political machine than the\r\nparliamentary system can raise. Socialisation and reconstruction have\r\nbeen going back, not forward. The Socialisation Commission and the\r\nresponsible Minister have both resigned, because Weimar would not\r\ngive effect to their mildly socialistic recommendations. Yet nothing\r\ncan save Germany from bankruptcy and Bolshevism but a re-energising\r\nand reorganising of the people for peace at least as effective as that\r\nthey underwent in the war. Nothing can do this but a new ideal and new\r\ninstitutions. And the ideal of direct political power for the workmen\r\nand the institution of an industrial councils system is, so, far as I\r\ncan see, alone capable of drawing out such force as is still left and\r\nof driving the country through the slough of war weariness and waste.\r\n\r\nThe Councils movement in Germany, at first, followed much the same\r\ncourse at much the same pace as it did in Russia. In Germany, as in\r\nRussia, the Councils, after reaching at a bound the sole power during\r\nthe days of revolution, relapsed under a re-assertion of Parliamentary\r\nand Party government; then recovered, and, in the case of Russia,\r\nrealised the second revolution. The German movement was last spring\r\n(1919) in the early stage of recovery. Its development is of special\r\ninterest to us, in that eventually the German movement will probably\r\ntake a middle place between the Russian and our own.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution the Labour movement in Germany was very much in\r\nthe same condition as with us. The attempt to combine on a patriotic\r\nplatform all productive forces, and to concentrate Capital and Labour\r\non winning the war, had only superficially smoothed over the distrust\r\nbetween Employers, Associations and Labour organisations, or the\r\ndissension between heads of unions and the bodies of workers. When the\r\nrevolution broke out on November 9th it was carried through first by\r\ncommittees of sailors, then of soldiers, and finally of workmen, that\r\nsprang up simultaneously and assumed supreme authority. The advent of\r\nthis new authority, however, brought about an alliance between the\r\nprevious authorities thus put on one side, the Employers' Associations\r\nand the Trades Unions.\r\n\r\nThe employers, who had hitherto been resisting claims for an\r\neight-hour day and a share in control, found themselves threatened\r\nwith expropriation. Under the leadership of a Captain of Industry,\r\nHugo Stinnes, they at once opened negotiations with the Unions led by\r\nLegien; and by November 15th reached agreement on the eight-hour day\r\nand the establishment of Labour Associations (_Arbeitsgemeinschaften_)\r\nequivalent to our Whitley Councils, and Labour Chambers\r\n(_Arbeitskammern_), for dealing with wages and welfare, in which\r\nemployers and employed would have equal representation.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Reichert, spokesman for the metal industries, has pointed out\r\nto his supporters, these concessions looked more than they were. For\r\nthe eight-hour day would have to be abandoned unless, as was unlikely,\r\nit became general in Europe; and as to the associations, it should\r\nalways be possible to get in and bring over a \"Christian\"\r\nrepresentative of one of the Labour organisations under the influence\r\nof the Catholic Centrum. It is this agreement, none the less, between\r\nthe Trust and Trade Union bosses that is the basis of the present\r\nCoalition Government's Labour policy, and that is embodied in the new\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nBut, since the revolution, the real Labour movement of Germany has\r\npassed to the \"Councils\" (_Raete_), as we must call them for want of a\r\nbetter word. For \"moot\" is too archaic and \"committee\" suggests either\r\na party of bores and busybodies or a _posse_ of Bulgarian brigands;\r\nwhile Soviet, which is only the Russian for Council, would mean\r\nbranding the movement as \"Bolshevist.\"\r\n\r\nOf these Councils then, the three main divisions in Germany are\r\nWorkmen's Councils (_Arbeiterraete_), or Industrial Councils\r\n(_Betriebsraete_), Soldiers' Councils, and Communal Councils. Of these,\r\nthe first only seem to have a constitutional future in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Communal Councils have not yet been fully admitted to the Council\r\nsystem, and seem to have but little vitality.\r\n\r\nThe Soldiers' Councils, which played the more prominent part in the\r\nrevolution, and still form part of the organisation, have not\r\nsucceeded in making headway against the efforts of the Government to\r\ndemobilise them. Thus a regulation of January 19th reduced them to\r\nwelfare committees and restricted their right of deposing officers to\r\na mere recommendation. Attempts of the more revolutionary corps to\r\nresist authority in December, January and March were put down by the\r\nFrei-Corps with excessive and progressive severity; and the large\r\nbodies of revolutionary troops that survived the demobilisation, as\r\n\"Republican Guards,\" \"Public Safety Guards,\" \"People's Naval\r\nDivision,\" &c., &c., have been gradually dispersed by the Government's\r\nFrei-Corps.[F] So that the Soldiers' Councils as the political organ\r\nof the revolutionary fighting forces are losing their importance. Now\r\nthat the British Admiralty have recognised \"welfare committees\" in the\r\nNavy, it is safe to assert that the Council movement in Germany so far\r\nas concerns the armed forces is no longer in advance of ours.\r\n\r\nReturning, therefore, to the Industrial Councils, we find that in the\r\nearly days of the revolution the movement spontaneously developed an\r\norganisation consisting of a national Central Council, elected by a\r\nnational Congress of Councils, in its turn elected by local Executive\r\nCouncils. These were all political institutions, which for a few days\r\nenjoyed entire political power. This power passed back to the old\r\npolitical Parties and Parliamentary system, owing to the Council\r\naccepting as \"Commissaries of the People\" Parliamentary politicians,\r\nwhose sole idea and secret intention it was to reconstitute a Cabinet\r\nand reconstruct a Chamber on reformed but not revolutionary lines. The\r\ncapital error was in trying to realise the revolution by only\r\nestablishing revolutionary bodies--the Councils--in supervision of,\r\ninstead of in substitution for, politicians and officials of the old\r\n_regime_. This was the cause of the relapse into reaction.\r\n\r\nThe real revolutionaries realised this mistake and Liebknecht, after\r\naccepting office, withdrew and joined the Communists and\r\n\"Spartacists.\" The Communists were and are, of course, \"whole-hoggers\"\r\nin the Council movement, whose war cries are, \"All power to the\r\nSoviets\" and \"Down with the Assembly.\" The Independents ranged from\r\nmen like Ledebour, Daeumig and Richard Mueller, who saw in the Councils\r\nthe salvation, not only of the revolution, but of civilisation, to men\r\nlike Haase, Cohn and Breitscheidt, who believed that Parliamentary\r\ndemocracy and proletarian dictatorship could be co-ordinated. The\r\nSocial-Democrats ranged from members of the Council organisation, who\r\nbelieved that the Councils should have economic functions, and who\r\nwere last summer coming over to the Independents, down to men like\r\nLegien, who would abolish the Councils as a revolt against the Trade\r\nUnions, or Noske, who would abolish them as rebels against authority.\r\nThe Democrats included intellectuals, who recognised the political\r\nutility of the Councils, but consisted mostly of Liberals with no\r\nappreciation for them: though many of these latter had been coming\r\nover to the idea, as, for instance, the veteran economist, Brentano,\r\nor the internationalist, Schucking.\r\n\r\nOwing to a tactical blunder of the Independents, the Central Council,\r\nas well as the Cabinet of Commissaries, came under the sole control of\r\nthe Social-Democrats, the Trade Unions, and Moderate Socialists.\r\nConsequently, the Central Council, instead of being the citadel of the\r\nCouncil system, became a salient from which the enemies of the system\r\ncould undermine its whole position.\r\n\r\nThe Central Council, pursuing the Government's policy that all power\r\nin the hands of revolutionary authorities must be surrendered to the\r\nparliamentary institutions, in February publicly and formally\r\nrecommitted its mandate, whatever that might be, to the Assembly. One\r\nmight have supposed that this solemn suicide of its central authority\r\nwould have been the end of the Council movement. But exactly the same\r\nsurrender of the Central Council occurred at a similar stage of the\r\nRussian revolution, with the result, not that the movement collapsed,\r\nbut that control of it passed from the Socialists to the Communists.\r\nThis seems likely to be the result in Germany. The first consequence\r\nof the abdication of the Central Council was that leadership passed to\r\nthe Executive Council of Berlin, where the Independents and Communists\r\nwere already in a majority. The Executive Council proceeded to press\r\nfor a convocation of the Congress of Councils, and thereby a\r\nre-election of the Central Council. The latter procrastinated, but\r\ngave way on the Executive Council threatening to convene the Congress\r\nitself, but even then succeeded in having it postponed more than\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nNow, while the Opposition was moving to the Left in attempts to\r\nrealise the revolution, the Government was moving to the Right, and\r\nrapidly restoring the old Police-State behind a facade of\r\nparliamentary institutions. The consequence was a growing\r\ndissatisfaction with the Government, which, for want of proper\r\nexpression through the Council organisation, broke out in periodic\r\nstrikes and street fights. These were exploited by the Government as\r\nexcuses for repressive and reactionary measures, which all contributed\r\nto reinforcing the Council movement. It was the vicious circle that we\r\nin England have come perilously near more than once.\r\n\r\nThe defection of the Central Council also resulted in depriving the\r\nwhole Council movement of any stability and solidarity, and drove it\r\ninto local offensives or \"_putsches_,\" which were beaten in detail.\r\nFirst Bremen and the coast ports, then Dusseldorf and the coal area,\r\nnext Saxony and the industrial districts, and finally, in the first\r\nweek of March, Berlin itself, all declared general strikes in which\r\nrecognition of the Council system was the principal demand. And the\r\nBerlin strike, following close on that of Saxony, did frighten the\r\nGovernment into what might have been a considerable concession.\r\n\r\nAs late as the end of February the Government had declared\r\nsemi-officially that no member of the Government had the slightest\r\nintention of having the Council system incorporated in the\r\nConstitution either legislatively or administratively; but two days\r\nafter the outbreak of the Berlin strike, early in March, the\r\nGovernment announced, not only the socialisation of mines but the\r\nsanction of the Council system in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe first Government scheme for organising the Councils was of much\r\nthe same character as the socialisation that it promised at the same\r\ntime--an elaborate organisation of Factory Councils, Industrial\r\nCouncils and Labour Chambers with \"economic functions\"; which all\r\nboiled down to little more than the \"Whitley Council\" principle\r\npreviously proposed and rejected by the workmen. Since then the\r\nGovernment has had to concede more, and Art. 165 of the Constitution\r\nas signed in August, recognises the Workmen's Councils without\r\nrepresentation of the employers, though they have to associate\r\nthemselves with employers' representatives in order to discharge their\r\nconstitutional functions. Thus associated they can intervene in social\r\nand economic legislation through a Central Economic Council. But it\r\nwas clear that neither this nor any other concession likely to be made\r\nby the Assembly would satisfy the workmen. A bi-cameral system might\r\nhave done so, but this the Coalition Government could never have\r\nimposed on its Centrum and middle-class supporters.\r\n\r\nThe best chance of arriving at a compromise between Parliamentary and\r\nCouncil government was through the Congress of Councils which at last\r\nmet in Berlin in May.\r\n\r\nThis Congress had also another function of the first importance. It\r\nafforded the only gauge available as to the velocity and volume of the\r\nrevolutionary revival. The Assembly at Weimar was in this, as in most\r\nrespects, useless. The Press was so coloured by class and party\r\nfeeling as to be quite unreliable. While owing to general\r\ndisorganisation of the country and the disintegrated nature of the\r\nrevolutionary movement the leaders of it themselves did not know what\r\ntheir forces were. All that was known was that there had been a steady\r\ndefection from the Majority Socialists supporting the Government and\r\nthe Parliamentary system to the Independents, in opposition, who\r\nadvocated a combination of Parliament and Councils; and from the\r\nIndependents to the Communists, who were for \"all power to the\r\nCouncils.\"\r\n\r\nSo steady had this leftward flow been that probably the Congress, if\r\nleft to itself, would have reflected it by coming together with a\r\nmajority for the Opposition. It would then have been able to begin at\r\nonce its function of elaborating a suitable compromise between\r\nParliament and Councils. For it is to be assumed that the Communists\r\nand the right Majoritarians would have been each in a small minority,\r\nwith an absolute majority for delegates representing the Independent\r\nposition. That this was, at the time, the prevalent opinion in the\r\nmovement is suggested by the delegates from German-Austria associating\r\nthemselves with the Independents.\r\n\r\nHowever, partly for the better preservation of party, power, and\r\nplace, partly from the pressure of constant \"officious\" admonitions\r\nfrom us that peace would only be made with a parliamentary government,\r\nthe German Government did their best to falsify the character of the\r\nCongress and get as many Majority Socialists into it as possible by\r\nhook or crook. The hook used was a new electoral arrangement prepared\r\nby the Central Council which most of the great towns rejected. In\r\nsome, as in Breslau, the delegates first elected were recalled, and\r\nreal workmen's representatives substituted. And when the Government\r\nfound its lost sheep weren't coming home, like Bo-peep, it took its\r\nlittle crook, determined for to find them; and found them indeed, but\r\nwith the historical result. For if by hook and by crook you make\r\nworkmen's delegates of country lawyers or country magistrates you\r\ncannot expect them to bring much of a working-class tail behind them.\r\nSo when the Council came together it was distinctly rather\r\nparliamentarian than proletarian in its character. But if the\r\nGovernment's object was to cripple and control the Congress it failed.\r\nBecause the first result of their gerrymandering was that the\r\nCommunists refused to take part, thereby greatly facilitating the\r\nsubsequent _rapprochement_ between the two Socialist factions, the\r\nMajority and the Independents.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, when it met, was found to consist of 130 Majority\r\nSocialists, 64 Independents, 20 soldiers' representatives, and about\r\n80 miscellaneous and absent; and of these quite a large number were\r\nnot working men at all. But all the same the difference between the\r\natmosphere of Parliamentary and Council government at once appeared\r\nwhen it got to work. For this much gerrymandered and very jerry-built\r\nCongress showed itself capable of adapting itself to pressures in a\r\nway that the National Assembly could not. It showed itself to be a\r\nreal deliberative body, capable of coming rapidly to a joint decision\r\nradically different from the several views subscribed by its\r\nindividual members before its meeting. In other words, the Congress\r\nhad vitality enough to make its constituents real representatives\r\ninstead of merely instructed delegates. Its response to the general\r\ntrend of opinion to the Left and against \"Government by the\r\nFrei-Corps\" was shown by its first vote which, by 199 to 81 called for\r\nthe release of Ledebour, an Independent \"intellectual\" imprisoned for\r\nalleged complicity in the January disorders. This was followed by a\r\nvote of congratulation to Hungary; while a similar congratulation to\r\nBavaria, where a \"Council Republic\" had just been proclaimed, was very\r\nproperly postponed as prejudging the whole question of Council\r\ngovernment that was before the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first days were passed in general debate, during which much\r\nnegotiation between section leaders and a general alignment of forces\r\nwere going on in the lobbies. A fictitious interest was given to this\r\nwork of \"realising the revolution\" by the Congress having met in the\r\nHerren-Haus, the old Prussian House of Lords, the shrine of reaction.\r\nIt was piquant to see a fervent Majority Socialist and a fiery\r\nIndependent discussing whether Parliament and universal suffrage were\r\nnot irretrievably reactionary, under the cold marble nose of a\r\nPrussian Princelet who had looked on them as the ultimate Chaos and\r\nDark Night of Revolution. But as will be seen, the _genius loci_, won\r\nin the latter end.\r\n\r\nThe Congress took some days in making up its mind what line to take.\r\nThe Majority leaders did not know which way to turn, associating\r\nthemselves when they could with attacks on the Government, and when\r\nthey could not, apologising. For though the Independents on one side\r\nand the small Democratic section on the other were disciplined bodies,\r\nthe Majoritarian bloc was disorganised. When it came to a vote they\r\nobeyed the whip, but many slipped out, and the vote was very different\r\nfrom what was expected.\r\n\r\nThe Government's advisers in politics and in the Press, finding that\r\nso far from bringing over the Independents to the Government the\r\nCongress was fast drawing the Majority into opposition, strongly\r\nrecommended the Government to close the Congress on the ground that it\r\nwas only wasting time in futile and inflammatory agitation. The\r\nIndependents countered this by forcing an immediate issue on the main\r\nquestion--the constitutional recognition of the Council system.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the discussion showed that a majority of the Congress\r\nfavoured a combination of Parliament and Councils in which the latter\r\nshould have political as well as economic functions. Whether the\r\nMajoritarian leaders in the Congress were genuinely convinced of the\r\nnecessity of giving the Council system recognition or whether they\r\nwere forced to compromise in order to retain command of their\r\nfollowers, and through them control their following among the workmen,\r\nI do not know. Anyway, after a series of speeches, in which the\r\nMajoritarian leaders, Kalinsky and Cohn-Reuss, vied in concessions, a\r\ncompromise was put forward that represented practically the position\r\nheld by their opponents the Independents a few weeks before. The\r\ncompromise between the Parliamentary system and Council system they\r\nproposed was probably workable; though arrived at from an unsound\r\nposition--that of regarding the Central Council as a controlling\r\nauthority over the National Assembly; whereas it would really be\r\nsupplying the driving power and the Assembly the brake.\r\n\r\nNow, although the Independents, for the same tactical reasons that had\r\ndriven the Majoritarians to the Left, were now proclaiming the\r\nprinciple of \"all power to the Councils\" (which had been until then\r\nthe position of the absent Communists) they were rather embarrassed at\r\nfinding themselves \"Bolshevists,\" explicitly demanding the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat. The spring running of German\r\npolitics to the Left had been so headlong that the parliamentarian\r\nleaders of the Left had had to sprint hard to keep ahead of their\r\nfollowers. But if they had kept one eye anxiously gauging the pace of\r\nthe avalanche surging at their heels they had kept the other guessing\r\nno less anxiously at the position of the abyss of \"Bolshevism\" ahead.\r\nAnd small wonder if they were a little bewildered and out of breath.\r\nFor as late as December they had been still accepting the Assembly as\r\nthe sole executant of the revolution, and looking on the Councils as\r\npractically extinct and politically eccentric. By January they had\r\nbeen forced to accept the Councils as a fact that had to be fitted in\r\nsomehow. In February their periodicals were full of schemes for giving\r\neconomic powers to the Councils, while reserving all political power,\r\nnational and provincial, to the Assemblies. By March they had\r\nrecognised that they must have political power as well and by April\r\nthey had reached the compromise of a bi-cameral constitution now\r\nadopted by their conservative opponents, the Majoritarians. And now,\r\nin order to clear the leftward road for the Majoritarians and keep\r\npace with the Communists, old parliamentary hands, like Haase, Oscar\r\nCohn and Breitscheidt, found themselves condemning their newly born\r\nand much beloved parliamentary democracy to be smothered in its cradle\r\nfor the benefit of a Bolshevist changeling. No wonder they were ready\r\nto join forces with their Socialist comrades of the majority in a\r\ncompromise which found a place for their firstborn the Weimar\r\nParliament and for their familiar world of party politics.\r\n\r\nThus the Socialist parties, still hopelessly divided in that cold\r\nstorage of faction, the Weimar Assembly, had been re-fused and\r\nre-moulded by the volcanic fires of the Congress.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, after the Congress had been a week at work, I\r\nheard that the leaders of these two sections had that morning\r\nprivately agreed to reconstitute the Central Council on a principle of\r\nparity, _i.e._, twelve Majoritarians and twelve Independents, with a\r\nfew Democrats and soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis private agreement, unreported until after it had been repudiated,\r\nwas a political event of an importance second only to the revolution\r\nitself. It reunited the Socialist party on a platform of realising the\r\nrevolution through the Council system by constitutional action. The\r\nCongress of Councils, for whose dissolution the whole Press were\r\nclamouring openly and every secret sinister influence was conspiring,\r\nhad in six days gone further towards the reconstruction and\r\nre-orientation of Germany than Weimar had in six months.\r\n\r\nBut one obvious result of this new alliance between Majoritarians and\r\nIndependents in the Council system would have been the jettisoning of\r\nMajoritarian Ministers, such as Noske, Landsberg and Scheidemann,\r\ncompromised by their complicity with reaction and the brutalities of\r\nthe Frei-Corps. It was therefore not surprising that the full force of\r\nparty pressure and of administrative authority was brought to bear on\r\nthe Majoritarian parties to the agreement. Under this pressure, like\r\ngood citizens and genuine Germans, they buckled up and broke down,\r\nrepudiating the principle of parity. They offered instead a proportion\r\nof fourteen Majoritarians to ten Independents in the Central Council\r\nor a representation corresponding to the numerical proportion of\r\nparties in the gerrymandered Congress. These offers were refused, the\r\nCongress came to an end, and the pusillanimity and place-hunting of\r\nparliamentary politicians had ruined the revolution a second time. The\r\nfirst was when the Independents, under pressure from the Left,\r\nwithdrew from the Coalition with the Majoritarians in December. The\r\nsecond was when the Majoritarians, under pressure from the Right, now\r\nin their turn withdrew from the reconstituted Coalition in May.\r\n\r\nThe Council was reconstituted with Majoritarians, and the Independents\r\nwere thrown back upon the Communists and \"direct action.\" The only\r\ncourse then left to the adherents of the Council movement was to\r\nperfect their organisations and wait until parliamentary government\r\nwas overthrown, either by reaction or revolution. The first essential\r\nfor such organisation was a general electoral system which would put\r\nthe Councils on a regular basis and prevent such interference and\r\nintrigues as had preceded the previous Congress. The last meeting that\r\nI attended of the Plenary Assembly of Berlin Councils, the driving\r\nbody of the movement, was occupied with discussing the crucial\r\nquestion as to who should be considered a workman and qualified to\r\nvote and stand for a Council. It was there tentatively agreed that a\r\nworkman might have a few assistants without becoming an employer, and\r\nthat scientists, experts, and such like connected with an industry,\r\nother than managers, directors and such, might count as workmen. On\r\nthe other hand the Assembly had to adjourn for a time in disorder\r\nowing to protests against the presence of a police official as a\r\ndelegate of the Democrats. It was clearly going to be difficult to\r\nexpress in terms of an electoral law a disability obvious enough in\r\neach individual case. The German workmen were ready to admit to\r\nequality anyone with any industrial productive status, who was not in\r\nthe service of declared enemies of the Councils--such as the captains\r\nof industry or the Coalition Government. And so important is this\r\nsuffrage question as a gauge of the liberality of the Council movement\r\nin Germany and of its distinction from Bolshevism, that I append as a\r\nfootnote the regulation of the Berlin Executive Council, published\r\nprevious to the Convention of the second Congress of Councils.[G]\r\n\r\nThis work of making the Council system really representative has been\r\nmuch hampered of late by the growing reaction which is still trying to\r\nbreak the neck of the movement by arresting its leaders, and impeding\r\nits development in every way. At the same time, schemes are being\r\ncontinually put forward by the less reactionary elements for drawing\r\nthe teeth of the movement by \"diddling\" concessions. Among such may be\r\ncounted the clauses \"anchoring\" the Councils in the Constitution. The\r\nword itself shows how rapidly the German politicians are picking up\r\nthe devices of parliamentary democracy. Again and again, on the\r\nplatform and in the Press, the workmen are assured that all is well\r\nwith the Councils because they are \"anchored\" in the Constitution.\r\nWhat the workmen want is not to see them \"anchored\" so much as under\r\nway; but it is creditable diddling is that catchword, \"anchored in the\r\nConstitution.\" And another diddling device is the electoral law\r\nadvocated by the Majoritarians that the Government are trying to\r\nimpose on the Councils, which would penetrate the movement with\r\npropertied interests and partition it up into regional areas.\r\n\r\nOf late, indeed, the Council movement proper--the revolutionary\r\nmovement--has been almost driven underground. The Central office of\r\nthe Berlin Executive Council has been repeatedly raided, its leaders\r\nare continually being arrested, and its meetings broken up. At a\r\nconference of the Industrial Councils of Germany recently held (August\r\n26th, 1919) at Halle from which all Majoritarians were excluded, the\r\ngeneral tone was pessimistic. It was recognised that the German\r\nworkman was not as a whole revolutionary in sentiment, that the mass\r\nmovement to the Left that had marked the first months of reaction had\r\nto some extent been checked and that the Government policy of\r\ncompromising with the Council movement had had some measure of\r\nsuccess. No agreement could be reached at this conference, even on\r\nsuch primary questions of policy as to whether the Government\r\nproposals should be considered or whether the Trades Unions should be\r\nco-operated with. Finally, centres of the revolutionary movement were\r\nestablished at Halle and Leipzig.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem that the revolutionary Council movement is\r\njust at present passing through a phase of depression due to the\r\nGovernment's diplomatic policy.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that so far the German Councils are no political\r\nsystem, but only a surge of spontaneous self-government. If they can\r\nbe really co-ordinated with the new political machinery, and if they\r\ncan be concentrated on the economic reconstruction of Germany, it may\r\nbe the salvation, not only of Germany but of Europe. For, though the\r\nyears of war have accustomed us to looking on Germans as barbarians\r\nand better dead than alive, as a matter of fact this unattractive\r\npeople is still, as it always has been, the sturdiest and steadiest of\r\nthe workers of the world; and Germany is still the centre of gravity\r\nof the European social system. There can be no stability in Europe if\r\nthe Germans are on strike. The consequences of driving the Russians\r\ninto extremes are before us now in the worst menace to the existing\r\nsocial order since the peasants' rising of the Middle Ages. It will\r\ntake much pressure to drive the German revolution into extremes, but\r\nif Germany once develops a real Bolshevism of its own, it will not be\r\nlong before the rest of the Continent follows its example.\r\n\r\nIt is a national characteristic of us English to fight new ideas and\r\ninstitutions in principle abroad, while, in practice, we introduce\r\nthem at home under different names. This has worked well on the whole.\r\nWhile reaction is occupied with damning and downing the novelty as an\r\nabsurdity and atrocity introduced by the brutal and barbarous\r\nforeigner, _real-politik_ finds that the same novelty, under some new\r\nname, helps production at home. Thus, while we fight the _Soviets_\r\nwith military expeditions and poison gas, and the milder\r\n_Raete-Republics_ of Germany with military missions and diplomatic\r\nnotes, we work away at our Guild Socialism and our Shop Stewards'\r\nCommittees, extend Whitley Councils to the Civil Service and Welfare\r\nCommittees to the Navy, and even admit employes to joint control of\r\nour railways.\r\n\r\nThere is an English revolution not only impending, but in progress,\r\nand those to whom revolution means barricades and \"Bolshevism\" will be\r\nrelieved to hear that the course of events, both in Germany and\r\nRussia, suggests that our British revolution is so well advanced that\r\nthese stimulants of a revolution, that has stiffened and stagnated,\r\nwill not be required. England, not being wholly, at all events for\r\nlong, run by London clubs and political cliques, manages to achieve\r\nits political revolution by way of economic reconstruction, and it is\r\ndoing this on the same principles as Germany, though by a different\r\nprocedure. That is why it was as foolish for the British to try to\r\nupset the Council movement of the Berliners as it was for the\r\nBerliners to upset it among the Brunswickers and Bavarians.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the Councils can still be killed, the Germans themselves\r\nwill eventually kill them by diddling concessions or by diplomatic\r\ncompromises. For such compromises as those already put forward in\r\nGermany show a fatal ignorance of, or indifference to, the fundamental\r\nfacts of this revolutionary movement. I much doubt whether the German\r\nrevolutionary workmen and their political leaders, whether Independent\r\nor Communist, can ever be got to accept the Labour Chamber\r\n(_Arbeitskammer_) with its parity of representation between employers\r\nand employed; at all events, until the employer is represented by the\r\nState. And such \"nationalisation \"is only valued by the German workman\r\nas a preliminary to \"socialisation.\" The workers are attached to the\r\nCouncil idea largely because it attacks the capitalist, and gives the\r\nworkmen protection against him in a way the Union cannot. If the\r\nCouncils are to be widened into a democracy including all classes, the\r\npower of private capital must first be broken or brought in bounds.\r\n\r\nSo desperate is the economic condition of the country that even the\r\nEmployers' Associations of Berlin have declared in favour of a large\r\nmeasure of Council government. But this is an exception. The German\r\nruling class, and their middle-class supporters, recognise that their\r\nclass supremacy is challenged. They retort by attacking Council\r\ngovernment as class government and, consequently, as undemocratic. The\r\nissue is represented as being between a Parliamentary democracy, as in\r\nEngland, and a Soviet despotism, as in Russia. It seems worth while,\r\ntherefore, to the German ruling class to fight the revolution with its\r\nown weapon of violence, rather than face the risks of Council\r\ngovernment; and this same view would doubtless be taken in England if\r\nthe question of principle were raised. In the recent railway strike\r\nour Government, by appealing for national support against a leading\r\nsection of Labour, did, in fact, go far to create a class war.\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, the demand for a dictatorship by the\r\nproletariat is not an essential element in the Council movement. Such\r\na demand is not the cause, but the consequence, of class conflict.\r\nEssentially and fundamentally the Council movement, so far from being\r\nless democratic than our Parliamentary system, is a revolt back to\r\nthe purest and most primitive democracy from the artificialities and\r\nanomalies of modern Parliamentary representation. It is no more\r\nundemocratic than the Renaissance was inartistic, the Reformation\r\nunchristian, or the French Revolution anarchical. As the German\r\nRevolution best shows, the growth of Councils is the result of a\r\nrevolutionary impulse in a modern community. Such an impulse uses any\r\nform of association between men and women for the urgent political\r\npurpose of appointing a spokesman and leader. The most widely spread\r\nand deeply rooted association nowadays is industrial--in the workshop.\r\nConsequently, we find the Councils taking predominantly an industrial\r\ncharacter and origin, as in our native embryo the Shop Stewards'\r\nCommittee. But any association will serve; and so, in the German\r\nRevolution, besides the Workmen's Councils there were Soldiers'\r\nCouncils, Communal Councils, and even Unemployed Councils. If this new\r\nsystem were to develop, so to say, in a vacuum, without opposition, it\r\nwould theoretically provide a democratic representation for every\r\nhuman relationship. As it is, such representation is reduced, as in\r\nGermany, by political pressure, to association that is rooted in the\r\nmost vital relationship; and we find the Unemployed Councils,\r\nCommunal Councils, and even Soldiers' Councils being choked off, and\r\nonly the Workmen's Councils surviving. This is why the practical\r\nprocess in Germany is, as said before, leading to the same conclusions\r\nas those come to by the _a priori_ reasoning of our own Guild\r\nSocialists when they divide the citizen into consumer and producer,\r\nand, in his latter capacity, give him representation through a Council\r\nsystem. I found, in fact, that my most useful function in Germany at\r\none time was putting German Labour leaders in possession of the\r\nconclusions of our Guild Socialists.\r\n\r\nNor, when we come to examine constitutional history, is there any real\r\ndifference between the democracy of the Council system and the\r\ndemocracy of Parliament. They are the same in origin and will probably\r\nbe the same in development. For Parliament, it must be remembered,\r\ngrew out of a Council with an industrial suffrage--land tenure--which\r\nwas later reinforced by a general industrial suffrage through the\r\nBoroughs and their Guild organisations. But, for the first two\r\ncenturies of its existence, say 1100 to 1295, Parliament, the National\r\nCouncil of our Angevin Kings, was a _Soviet_, a _Betriebsrat_. It was\r\nto this body that we owe our Magna Charta of 1215, the foundation of\r\nour democracy. And, in the fourteenth clause of the Great Charter,\r\nthe clause constituting Parliament, we read that the summons was to be\r\nsent direct to the Archbishops and Bishops, Earls and Greater Barons,\r\nand, through the Sheriff, to all those \"who hold of us in chief.\" It\r\nwas this latter body of tenants of the Crown that became the Knights\r\nof the Shire in our House of Commons. The Knights of the Shire\r\nrepresented the landed industrial interest as directly as the\r\nrepresentatives of the Boroughs represented other forms of industry\r\nand commerce. Of course, later, the regional and representative system\r\ngradually overlaid and obscured the original industrial basis, much as\r\nit has done with the Council system in Russia and is doing in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Council system in Germany has, in three months, indeed, covered\r\nthe course that took our Parliamentary system three centuries. This\r\ncorresponds roughly to the increased pace of political development\r\nto-day. If we were to translate the Council movement of to-day into\r\nthe terms of the Parliamentary movement of seven centuries ago, we\r\nmight say that, before our present democracy could begin, industry had\r\nto be nominally socialised by the principle that all land was held of\r\nthe King, and a strong central government established on a popular\r\nbasis of industrial councils, with equal representation for the two\r\nother estates, the feudal or military and the clerical or official.\r\nFor we can see the progenitors of the Soldiers' Councils of to-day in\r\nthe feudal courts of yesterday, and of the Civil Service bureaucracy\r\nof to-day in the chancellors and justiciars of yesterday. Thus we may,\r\nif we like, see in the short history of the Russian Council movement\r\nan epitome of our whole constitutional history. Or, we may compare the\r\npresent Council movement in England with the political situation early\r\nin the thirteenth century, when the Greater Barons, progenitors of our\r\nCaptains of Industry, were about to force clause 14 of Magna Charta\r\nand a National Whitley Council on a Civil Service of arrogant\r\nascetics, who were vainly trying to retain power for a silly and\r\nselfish ruling class. In applying this analogy to the present day, the\r\nParliament of to-day would be no more than a survival of a previous\r\nconstitutional epoch, a Witanagemot applying Anglo-Saxon Dooms. And\r\nthis will, any way, give an idea of the way parliaments are looked\r\nupon to-day by German workmen. Possibly, in the end, the\r\nrepresentative and regional system will rule the roost again, and will\r\nforce the industrial suffrage upstairs into a House of Lords that\r\nwill, in time, exercise mainly the judicial functions peculiar to its\r\noriginal industrial character. But we have first to get our Magna\r\nCharta and our Statutes of Westminster.\r\n\r\nThat the Council system of to-day is a truer democracy than existing\r\nParliamentary systems is also shown practically by its being a much\r\nsurer and safer machine for the realisation of public opinion.\r\nTheoretically, the pyramidal piling up of Councils, each represented\r\nin a superior Council, until a Central Council caps the pile, would\r\nseem to be indirect election raised to infinity; and indirect election\r\nis theoretically undemocratic. But this was not the conclusion forced\r\non one in Germany when one compared the working of the two systems.\r\nThe inferiority in the position of politicians, owing their power to\r\nthe Parliamentary system, compared with that of those based on the\r\nCouncil system, was very striking. The Parliamentarians never knew\r\nwhere they were or what was what. Out of touch, necessarily, with\r\ntheir enormous constituencies, they seemed to be always crawling about\r\nwith their ears to the ground, dependent on agents and reporters of\r\nevery sort, even on the Press, for an idea of what was going on. As\r\nthey never knew where the hounds were, they could not use such\r\nknowledge of the country as they had to lead the field. The leaders of\r\nthe Council movement, on the other hand, had an immediate indication\r\nof every trend of opinion in the changing composition of the lower\r\nstrata of Councils; and their difficulty was rather to control the\r\nenergies that came pouring up to them through the system. The\r\nParliamentary leader seemed like a water finder, wandering about and\r\nwaiting for the twig to twiddle, while the Council leader was more\r\nlike a marine engineer with his eye on the pressure gauge and his hand\r\non the lever. Perhaps indirect election is only undemocratic when the\r\nfunction of the lower body is mainly to elect to a higher, but becomes\r\ndemocratic when it has vital functions of its own that are merely\r\ncontrolled by the higher body.\r\n\r\nAnd yet another point and a paradox. Whereas the results of Council\r\nrepresentation of opinion in Germany are not revolutionary, the\r\nresults of the Parliamentary system are becoming more and more so, and\r\nnot only in Germany but in Great Britain. The failure of the\r\nParliamentary system to express the forces making for change--a\r\nfailure not confined to Germany--and the fictitious relationship\r\nbetween the elector and the elected has two results. It diverts a\r\nlarge part of these forces of progress into various forms of direct\r\naction, all of them revolutionary, whether actively so, such as street\r\nfighting, or passively so, such as strikes. It also gives a\r\nrevolutionary character to the periodical elections. For the vast\r\nconstituencies vote merely along the line of the least common multiple\r\nof their mob minds. This line is generally a vague dissatisfaction;\r\nand unless it be diverted by \"stunts\" or otherwise diddled, will\r\nresult in violent pendulum swings. Under these impulses Parliament\r\nwill become still less representative, and will tend to be either\r\nrevolutionary or reactionary. For an exaggerated majority is the\r\nextremists' opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Council movement, on the other hand, slowly changing from below\r\nupwards, should never drop much behind the drift of opinion, and\r\nconsequently should be in little danger of being driven ahead of it.\r\nThe German Parliament, as the results of an election decided by this\r\nL.C.M. motive of the mob mind--a motive of assuring power to whichever\r\nparty seemed to offer the best prospect of peace abroad and at\r\nhome--is to-day reactionary. Whereas the political condition of\r\nGermany to-day is such that it absolutely must have a Government\r\nresponsive to the requirements of reconstruction, or relapse into\r\ncivil war. The Weimar Parliament is so dead that only civil war can\r\ngalvanise it to action. If reinforced by a Council system, the Weimar\r\nParty Government and the Preuss Federal Constitution would perhaps\r\nhave steam enough to work.\r\n\r\nThe Councils are as essential to Germany to-day as the Commons were to\r\nus a century ago. Indeed, our insistence on the supremacy of the\r\nWeimar Assembly as a guarantee for the maintenance of peace, can be\r\nparalleled by our insistence a century ago on the maintenance of Upper\r\nHouses in the constitutions of the States revolutionised from France.\r\nThe function of the territorially elected Parliament will, in Germany,\r\nand probably everywhere, become more and more that of an Upper House;\r\nwhile the industrially elected Congress will be the creative and\r\nconstructive institution. The whole difficulty lies in finding a\r\nworking compromise, or rather co-operation. Just as Feudalism imposed\r\nits political system which survives in the House of Lords, just as\r\nLiberalism imposed its system as represented in the House of Commons,\r\nwhich now obviously requires supplementing, so Socialism must have its\r\npolitical system in the Councils. This is not revolution but\r\nevolution. The revolution comes from thwarting and threatening it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] They have since been replaced by two anti-revolutionary bodies, a\r\nsort of gendarmerie and a local middle class militia (Einwohnerwehr).\r\nThe Frei-corps have become the Reichswehr.\r\n\r\n[G] The re-organisation and reconstruction of our political and economic\r\nexistence calls for the co-operation of the whole effective population.\r\nThe revolution has given us the means of such reconstruction in the\r\nCouncil system. In order to give the Council system its full development\r\nand a better foundation, fresh elections to the Workmen's Councils are\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n1. All hand and head workers over 10 years without distinction of sex\r\nwho earn their living by labour of public utility without exploiting the\r\nlabour of others are entitled to vote. Are also entitled those who\r\nemploy a limited number of helpers for their livelihood, as doctors,\r\ndruggists, writers, jurists, artists, etc.--as also small industrials\r\nand craftsmen who do not employ others.\r\n\r\n2. Are excluded from voting those owners of means of production who use\r\nthem to their own advantage and always through the labour of others.\r\nAlso those who rent a private-capitalist industry or institutions worked\r\nby the labour of others. Also those who live from ground rents or\r\ninterest as also those like Directors, etc., paid in percentage fees.\r\n\r\n3. Elections to Workmen's Councils are by proportional representation\r\nand by professions or industries. Great industries form distinct\r\nelectoral bodies while medium and small industries will be associated.\r\nProfessions and professional groups that do not work with other employes\r\nwithin a particular industry will form professional electoral bodies;\r\nemployes in domestic service, housewives, unemployed and invalids will\r\nbe provided for in special regulations.\r\n\r\nFurther instructions as to the electoral regulations and procedure will\r\nbe issued shortly.\r\n\r\n                                 The Executive Council,\r\n                                                  RICHARD MUeLLER,\r\n                                                  FRITZ PROLAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF VERSAILLES\r\n\r\n\r\nComing back from Germany to Great Britain one finds oneself in the\r\nposition of an explorer returned from a new world. For our Edwardian\r\nEngland knows to-day as little of the real conditions in Central\r\nEurope as Elizabethan England knew of Central Africa. And our Press\r\ncartoonists and Propaganda caricaturists have filled the blank spaces\r\nof our mental maps with fancy pictures of monsters whom they label\r\nBoches and Bolsheviks, Huns and Spartacists, just as did the old\r\ncartographers. Whereas these fancy pictures are no more like the real\r\nwild beasts of Europe than the Unicorns and Behemoths of the old maps\r\nwere like the rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses of Africa; and anyway\r\nare about as important an element in the problems of Central Europe\r\nto-day as the hippopotamuses are in those of Central Africa.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that our natural intuitions of policy and our\r\nnatural instincts of humanity have been for five years persistently\r\nperverted and distorted. We do not know that we are seeing everything\r\nas in a glass darkly, and that we are being prevented from coming face\r\nto face with real facts and forces. That is why in this summer of\r\n1919, as in that summer of five years ago, appeals to our conscience\r\nand common sense are useless. We are letting ourselves be hurried\r\nhopelessly and helplessly into the worst of peaces, as we then let\r\nourselves be hurried into the worst of wars. But with this difference;\r\nthat five years ago the principal criminals were the Junkers and War\r\nLords of Germany; to-day they are the Jingoes and Peace Delegates of\r\nthe Entente. The Germans have paid, or are paying, the penalty of\r\ntrusting their War Lords; both those Germans who passively submitted\r\nto that folly and those who actively protested against it. We, too,\r\nshall all have to pay for putting our trust in our Princes of the\r\nPeace. We are paying--many of my old corps have already paid with\r\ntheir lives--for the mistakes of our diplomatists with the Russian\r\nRevolution. We shall pay for their mistakes with the German Revolution\r\nwhen we too come face to face with realities again.\r\n\r\nFor that is the main difference between the Germans and ourselves\r\nto-day. They have been reduced to realities. The artificialities of\r\ntheir shoddy Kaiser and their shallow Kultur have fallen in ruins\r\nround them. The monstrous military machine they built up for their own\r\nprotection, and used for the oppression of Europe, is smashed. There\r\nremains just the German burgher and the German worker, both\r\nslow-witted simple souls. So slow and simple indeed, that they have\r\nallowed a few hundred German bureaucrats to go on governing them;\r\nthereby giving us a wrong impression of what they are thinking and\r\nwanting. In reality the Germans to-day are like the Russians of two\r\nyears ago, a molten mass awaiting a new mould, ready to be inspired by\r\nsuch new political ideas as may be instilled into them. In Germany now\r\na new idea will take root, flower and bear fruit in a few days. I have\r\nwatched the process myself with ideas imported from England. But\r\ninstead of throwing open the western frontier of Germany to free\r\ncommerce and communication we maintained our blockade and our boycott,\r\nthereby forcing New Germany to turn to the East for its ideals and\r\ninstitutions. And now comes this Treaty with a further development of\r\nthis same policy of blockade and boycott. Germany is for a generation\r\nor so to be sentenced to loss of its sovereign rights, confiscation\r\nof its whole estate and penal servitude. We have overlooked the\r\nopportunity we had of making Germany a moral dependency, a natural\r\nally looking at the world from our political point of view, absorbing\r\nour ideas and associating itself with our ideals; and we have abused\r\nthe opening given us by unlimited military power in order to attempt\r\nthe material exploitation of Germany. We might have made Germany a\r\nracial and regional border province of Anglo-Saxondom, and a barrier\r\nagainst the Asiatic irruption that is once again advancing against\r\nEurope across the Russian plains. We have preferred to try and reduce\r\nit to another Ireland--an Ireland of seventy millions with Russia at\r\nits back. I am reminded of the remark of a German politician: \"Give us\r\nan open door and we shall be no worse than poor relations; build a\r\nChinese wall against us and you will make us into Tartars.\"\r\n\r\nAn adequate criticism of the Treaty that we are proposing to force on\r\nGermany would be as long as the Treaty itself. There are two main\r\ndifficulties in such criticism; one is that, owing to the secret\r\npreparation of the Treaty and the public indifference as to its\r\nprovisions, very few people in England have any idea even of what the\r\nfinancial and economic clauses amount to. German protests are ignored,\r\nof course, as mere \"squealing.\" We have a general feeling that what\r\nis bad for the Germans is good for the world; and, anyway, we don't\r\nwant to be bothered with Germany any more.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty is the Treaty's formlessness and its want of\r\ndesign. A careful comparison of the articles and their appendices\r\nsuggests that the essential policy of the whole is a compromise\r\nbetween, or rather a cobbling together of, two contradictory points of\r\nview, the French and the Anglo-Saxon; while in its externals it is an\r\nattempt to camouflage European Imperialism with American Idealism.\r\n\r\nIn the Jehad we have just fought against Germany, the low material\r\nobject of the French was to extirpate; while that of the English was\r\nrather to enslave. The high moral object of the French was to rescue\r\nAlsace-Lorraine; the high moral object of the English was to protect\r\nBelgium. Consequently, reading the Treaty is something like reading\r\nthe Koran. The mind cannot get the point of view or purpose. It loses\r\nitself in dicta, as determinative in detail for the weal or woe of\r\nmankind as they are disconnected in themselves and dissociated from\r\nany general doctrine, or even from any especial dogma. One soon gives\r\nup trying to grasp the Treaty. And one puts it aside with the\r\nconsoling thought that \"the Koran or the Sword\" is good enough for\r\nthose who, like the Huns, are not \"people of the Law\"; and that\r\neverything depends on the \"idjra,\" the \"interpretative effort\" of\r\nfuture pundits.\r\n\r\nThere is something tragic about such petty killings and cruelties as\r\nthose ordained by the sinister reactionaries of the Eden Hotel in\r\nBerlin. But there is something ludicrous about the miseries and\r\nmurders _en masse_ organised by the highly respectable reactionaries\r\nof the Hotel Majestic. It is as though we:--\r\n\r\n    had resolved to extirpate the vipers\r\n    With twenty Balliol men and forty lady typers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of that Thursday in May, the German reading public took\r\nup its morning paper with a sigh of relief that the long suspense was\r\nended--and dropped it again with a gasp of despair. But Germany wore\r\nits rue with a difference. The opposition to the Treaty was of two\r\nkinds. The original split of the Independent idealists with the\r\nMajoritarian real-politikers had been over foreign policy--first in\r\nthe prosecution of the war, then in the preparation for peace. These\r\nIndependents condemned such crimes as the U-boat war and the military\r\nmurders of Miss Cavell and Captain Fryatt, uncompromisingly. Their\r\nmain reason for leaving the Coalition Socialist Government in\r\nDecember was that they could not get their liberal policy carried in\r\nrespect either of Poland and the Baltic provinces, or as to a frank\r\nrecognition of responsibility for the war and full reparation to\r\nFrance and Belgium.\r\n\r\nTheir main objection to the present Government had been that it\r\nprejudiced the German political revolution and spiritual renascence in\r\nthe eyes of the Entente. And they now, as representing the main forces\r\nof idealism in Germany, opposed the peace terms on international not\r\non national grounds--as a conspiracy against the peace and prosperity\r\nof the European worker, not as a combination against the power and\r\nprogress of the German Empire. Consequently, as the main body of the\r\nworkers, that is, the driving power of the country, were of this party\r\nand had moreover been forced out of practical politics by the reaction\r\nparty, when the terms were published there was no spontaneous\r\nexplosion of emotion in Germany. Crushing as they were, there was no\r\nmoral force to oppose against them; either national, as a century\r\nbefore in revolutionary France, or international, as a year before in\r\nrevolutionary Russia.\r\n\r\nThe whole tone of private conversations and of Press _communiques_ on\r\nThursday and Friday showed that the Government with individual\r\nexceptions, would sign the terms. And further the whole tradition of\r\nthe Majority-Socialist and of the Centrum rank and file suggested that\r\nthey would in this follow the lead of the Government and give it a\r\nparliamentary majority. Indeed, such passive acquiescence reflected\r\naccurately enough the prevalent point of view in a disorganised and\r\ndevitalised community.\r\n\r\nLate on that Friday night, judging from an account given me of the\r\nproceedings in the Cabinet and from general considerations, I\r\ntelegraphed that Germany would sign even such conditions as those\r\npublished.[H]\r\n\r\nBut where all is negative and minus, a very small positive and plus\r\nfactor can make itself predominant. The Democratic party represented\r\npolitically such nationalist idealism as was left. Theodor Wolff, in\r\nthe _Berliner Tageblatt_, started a campaign for non-signature, at\r\nfirst only with the compromising support of the extreme Right. Within\r\na few hours the feeble Government and half-famished capital came\r\nunder pressure from two points--Paris and the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe German delegation to Paris had been made very representative in\r\norder to strengthen the Government in eventually imposing unacceptable\r\nterms on various interests; but the effect of their week's wait in\r\ntheir wired pen at Fontainebleau seems to have been to give them all\r\nan incipient attack of \"barb wire fever.\" As the guiding brain of the\r\nCabinet, Landsberg had been substituted for David on the delegation\r\nowing to personal and political reasons, and as influential Majority\r\nSocialists were on it also, this was serious. Opposition to signature\r\nappeared in the Cabinet; and the leading article in Sunday's\r\n_Vorwaerts_ by Stampfer, the editor, who had gone to Paris hoping to\r\nmeet his French _confreres_ indicated that the Majority Socialists\r\nwere also dividing on the question of signature.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Democratic parliamentary party having declared\r\nunanimously against signature, the Centrum and Majority Socialists\r\nfollowed suit with large majorities--only five in the latter party\r\nvoting for signature. The Government Press then began to challenge the\r\nIndependents to make good their professed policy; with the intention\r\nof forcing them to form a Government which would take the odium of\r\nsigning. The Independent leaders were approached on these lines.\r\n\r\nThe Independents found themselves in a difficulty. At first they were\r\ninclined to accept, but realised in time that if they did so they\r\nwould be utterly prejudiced both politically and popularly. Moreover,\r\ntheir Left wing and the Communists would not join any Government on a\r\nParliamentary basis; while the Majority Socialists would probably help\r\nthe Right in throwing them out again on a nationalist reaction as soon\r\nas they had signed. They accordingly decided to declare for signature,\r\nbut to refuse to relieve the Government from the responsibility for\r\nits own policy.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary situation accordingly developed by Monday into the\r\nusual deadlock. But in Germany the parliamentary situation represents,\r\neven less than elsewhere, the realities of life. The meeting of the\r\nAssembly on Monday, which was to be a national demonstration, was a\r\nfailure both in staging and in steam. Held in the University aula,\r\nunder the great fresco of Fichte rallying the German youth to its\r\nresurrection after the peace of Tilsit, it only served to accentuate\r\nthe difference between the nationalist idealism that rebuilt Germany\r\nin the last century and the internationalist idealism that may\r\nrebuild it now. For, in this Assembly of more or less compromised and\r\nwholly commonplace elderly politicians there was nothing vital or\r\nnovel. The set speeches had mostly been written by propaganda\r\nofficials and the very applause had been planned beforehand.\r\n\r\nOn the following day were open-air meetings, which gave a better index\r\nof public opinion. Of the two I saw, the first was a big Majority\r\nSocialist gathering, addressed by Fischer on the Koenigsplatz in a\r\nspeech curiously like Scheidemann's. Thence a crowd that, if small,\r\nwas select, one might say \"super\" select, demonstrated before the\r\nHotel Adlon, the centre of the foreign correspondents and Missions,\r\nuntil dispersed by a rather dilatory detachment. But the foreign\r\ncorrespondents of course responded to these efforts for their\r\nentertainment and enlightenment with sensational \"stories\" of \"Scenes\r\nin Berlin.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion I came to was that those German working men who were\r\nstill under trade unionist and party leaders, would, with the middle\r\nclass, follow the Government lead in this, as in anything else.\r\n\r\nThe other meeting, in a remote workmen's quarter, was addressed by the\r\nIndependent Breitscheidt, whose every point was punctuated by\r\nguttural growls from half-starved workmen and women. The recital of\r\nGermany's renunciations and restrictions under the Treaty was listened\r\nto in silence; but the conclusion that the old _regime_, if\r\nvictorious, would have done this and worse was received with an\r\nemphatic \"sehr richtig\" (quite true). The interruptions from two\r\nmiddle-class youths near me, to the effect that an Englishman or\r\nFrenchman saying what Breitscheidt had said in London or Paris would\r\nhave to run for his life--true enough too--were badly received. \"Fat\r\ncheeks,\" screamed a haggard woman, pointing out that the young men\r\nwere chubby. \"Frei-Corps puppies,\" shouted a workman, giving the\r\nexplanation of their being well fed. And it would have gone hard with\r\nthem if the Independent leaders had not intervened to get them clear.\r\nThe speaker's conclusions that the peace must be signed at once, that\r\nit must be signed by those responsible for it, and that thereafter\r\nthere would be an \"Independent\" Government, was received with a\r\ndiminuendo of assent. The poorer and less political German workman\r\nwanted peace, but had no will to power.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no fight left in Germany; though I doubt if anyone in\r\nEngland realises how near the conditions imposed by Paris went to\r\nprovoking a desperate appeal to arms. When it became evident that no\r\nmitigation of importance was to be got, every member of the Government\r\nof any character, whether reactionary or radical, resigned; leaving\r\nonly men like Landsberg and Erzberger. While the revolutionary\r\nopposition persisted in their refusal to take the responsibility of\r\nsigning. When it became obvious that this \"Rump\" was prepared to sign,\r\nand that the Weimar Assembly would support it in doing so, a military\r\nconspiracy was organised to prevent signature by a _coup d'etat_.\r\nWeimar, the week before signature, filled with generals, and small\r\nbodies of Frei-Corps threatened the complaisant Cabinet. But obviously\r\nthe coercion of Weimar into refusing signature was not enough, and\r\nwould only have resulted in a second revolution rather than a\r\nreaction. The main operation was to have been a march south to Berlin\r\nand Weimar, of the Army of the East in West Prussia. But, at the last\r\nmoment, these Frei-Corps refused to move. The better elements of them\r\nhad volunteered to defend the frontiers against Poles and Russians,\r\nnot to overthrow the National Assembly at the orders of reactionary\r\ngenerals. The worse elements were ready to fight their own countrymen,\r\nthe revolutionaries, given a superiority of ten to one; but had no\r\nstomach for a last ditch defence against the Entente with the odds\r\nreversed. So Landsberg and Erzberger, the Jew and the Jesuit, by\r\nextraordinary and characteristic exertions, secured signature by a\r\nCabinet of nonentities under the burly and worthy Trades Union boss,\r\nBauer.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to criticise the different provisions of the Treaty\r\nof Versailles or show in detail where they are unjust and why they are\r\nunsound. But it may be of use to report the effect that certain of\r\nthese provisions have had in Germany and will have in Europe; and to\r\nrepresent how the force on which this treaty depends for its\r\nexecution--the static force of an enormous Entente preponderance in\r\nthe Balance of Power, comes into collision with the forces at work in\r\nEurope--the dynamic forces of the industrial revolution that are at\r\npresent more active in Germany than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as to its injustice and the effect this is having in\r\nGermany. There are three main foci of public opinion in Germany as in\r\nevery country: Right, Centre and Left: Conservative, Liberal and\r\nRadical: Upper Middle and Lower: Privilege, Property and Proletariat;\r\nor, however else you may chose to denote the eternal political\r\ntriangle. The Treaty deals each of these two blows; one blow slashes\r\noff its right hand and the other slaps it in the face. And it is the\r\ninsult and not the injury that will most affect the future of Europe.\r\n\r\nLet us take the Conservative idealists first--the Prussian landowner,\r\nthe Berlin official, the Bavarian cleric, the officer, and the\r\nstudent. The surrender of West Prussia and Danzig to Poland, and the\r\nseverance of East Prussia for its future inclusion in a Baltic\r\nFederation, mean the loss of its right arm to this ruling class. An\r\nidea of how it appears to them can be given, perhaps, by supposing\r\nthat we had lost the war, that Germany had set up Ireland and Scotland\r\nas separate States, had annexed Wales to Ireland on racial grounds,\r\nhad included therein Shropshire and Cheshire with their ancient county\r\nfamilies, and had made a corridor across Wessex to Weymouth, cutting\r\noff Somerset and Devon, while Cornwall went to a new State of\r\nBrittany. I do not mean, of course, that this would be exactly\r\nsimilar, but that the blow to the sensibilities of our patriots would\r\nbe as severe. Should we not have a halo cast about the Victorian, the\r\nElizabethan, the Alfredian and the Arthurian legends that would make\r\nthe lost provinces a Holy Land to be redeemed at any sacrifice?\r\nFortunately Germans are not like English in this and the territorial\r\nsettlement may last our time, though it will lead to unintended\r\nresults. The gloomy comment to me of a Polish conservative on the\r\nDanzig settlement was that in two generations Poland would be\r\nJew-German. The even more gloomy view of a Russian radical was that,\r\nunless Bolshevism made good, the whole middle belt of Baltic States,\r\nwith Poland, Lithuania, and the Ukraine, would fall under German\r\nbourgeois influence. While, most pessimistic of all, a cosmopolitan\r\nJew considered that the result of breaking up Austria and barring off\r\nGermany must be to Balkanise Central and Eastern Europe first, and to\r\nBolshevise it afterwards. All one can say, is, that where such\r\nrevolutionary forces are loosened as are now at large in Central\r\nEurope, German nationalism offered us a stronger line to hold than\r\nthat of Lithuanian or Ukrainian or even Polish independence.\r\n\r\nAnd we might have held both lines, but for that slap in the face. The\r\ntime I spent in Germany after the publication of the peace was made\r\npainful, not by the Danzig or Saar questions, but by the menace of\r\npenal proceedings against individual Germans. If our object was to\r\nfind something that would impress our hatred and contempt on the\r\nGermans we succeeded. Only the most moderate of those with nationalist\r\nopinions could speak of it at all: the majority, thereafter, closed\r\ntheir doors to me as an English-man. If anything could have\r\nrehabilitated the Kaiser, we should have done it by putting him at the\r\nhead of men, like submarine Commanders, who, in German eyes, had done\r\ndesperate deeds to break a barbarous blockade. Our prosecution in fact\r\noutraged both the sense and sensibilities of all German gentlemen as\r\nmuch as the crimes themselves had outraged ours. This may seem\r\nfanciful, but it is a fact. If action is taken under these criminal\r\nclauses we shall light such a candle to the memories of our dead as\r\nwill some day set Europe on fire again. Whether we could ever have\r\nproceeded by international action to trace the responsibility for\r\nmilitary murders, such as those of Miss Cavell and Captain Fryatt,\r\nwithout arousing a national sense of wrong in Germany, no longer\r\nmatters; we cannot do so now.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the effect of the Treaty on the Liberals, the moderates,\r\nthe men of property. If the ideals of the Conservatives and their\r\ninterests in land made them nationalist, the ideals of the Liberals\r\nand their interests in industry tended to make them imperialist. And\r\nthe Treaty cuts off Germany from all imperial ideals and cripples it\r\nin industry.\r\n\r\nThe growth of German industry in late years, comparable only to\r\nindustrial growth in North America, was due, as with us, to the\r\ncombination of coal with iron and of first-rate management with\r\nforeign markets. The Treaty has deprived Germany, in the east, of the\r\nSilesian coalfields with their dependent industries, and, in the west,\r\nof the Lorraine and Saar ores; which, together, may be compared to the\r\nloss of South Wales and Northumberland. It has also deprived Germany,\r\nnot only of its colonies, but also of its commercial establishments\r\nabroad, so closing foreign markets to it except by way of foreign\r\nintermediaries, bankers, brokers and shippers. There is nothing left\r\nof German foreign commerce and little left of German industry but a\r\nmutilated torso; for it has not only lost its right hand in Lorraine\r\nbut also its left in Silesia. Yet, what German men of business feel it\r\nhardest to forgive is not the injury done by the Treaty but the\r\ninsult. That camouflaged receivership, the Reparation Commission,\r\nprejudges Germany as a fraudulent bankrupt. If we had in the Treaty\r\nfixed our claims as creditors and negotiated with Germany as to how\r\nthey could be paid, the German middle class would have taken a pride\r\nin showing itself equal to the enormous emergency even as the French\r\ndid in the far less searching trial of 1870. But this foreign\r\nCommission has been given such powers as have never yet been proposed\r\nfor foreign financial control, even of the most wholly bankrupt and\r\nbarbarous Sovereign State. Those powers will, of course, never be\r\nexercised, and they would defeat the object of the financial\r\nprovisions of the Treaty if they were; but the unnecessary insult they\r\ninvolve has cost us the co-operation of the German middle classes in\r\nrebuilding the economic system of Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd, now for the last mistake. The one desire of the lower classes of\r\nGermany, whether industrial or agricultural, is for peace and plenty.\r\nIn condemning them to a continuance of war conditions for nine months\r\nafter their surrender and revolution we turned them from\r\ninternationalists, ready to welcome us as representatives of democracy\r\nand as crusaders for an international ideal, into either nationalists\r\nwho looked on us as enemies seeking the destruction of all Germans, or\r\ninto internationalists who looked on us as enemies of the revolution\r\nseeking their destruction as we were seeking that of the Russians. The\r\nresult has been that we have lost the co-operation of the German\r\nworking class in extending our system of parliamentary Government to\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe. And it requires no profound political\r\nknowledge of continental conditions to recognise that, without such\r\nco-operation, British political ideas and institutions and with them\r\nBritish political influence will not penetrate Europe.\r\n\r\nTo this result two actions on our part especially contributed. The\r\nfirst, our opposition to the union of German-Austria with Germany; the\r\nsecond, our refusal to admit Germany to the League of Nations. These\r\nwere the two meaningless, almost motiveless insults that in my opinion\r\nhave done us more lasting harm in Europe than such mistakes in practical\r\npolicy as the maintenance of the blockade. The repudiation, presumably\r\nat French dictation, of both the principle of nationality and that of\r\nself-determination was bad enough. It was worse to try to buttress an\r\nartificial barrier between two sections of the German race by assigning\r\nGerman populations to neighbouring States--Germans of Bohemia to\r\nTchecho-Slovakia--Germans of Karinthia to Yugo-Slavia--Germans of the\r\nTyrol to Italy. This diplomatic device failed even in a far more\r\nthorough form in Poland over a century ago. Just as the policy of\r\nartificial separation failed in the case of Eastern Roumelia.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from such moral considerations which must in the long run\r\ndefeat our policy of segregating Austro-Germans, that policy might\r\nhave been seen to be impolitic even in its most material and immediate\r\naspects.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a union of Germany and Austria presented itself to our\r\nminds as an aggrandisement of Germany. But if the union of Germany and\r\nAustria would have been a concession to the force of German\r\nnationality, yet it would have been no reinforcement of German\r\nnationalism. Union with German-Austria would indeed have been the best\r\nguarantee against Germany's relapse into Prussianism. For the marriage\r\nof Prussia and Austria would not be due to affection nor to ambition\r\nnor even to advantage, but to affinity. German-Austria might indeed\r\nconsider herself fortunate in having a relation bound by family ties\r\nto take her for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with all her\r\ndowry of decrepitude and debt. \"Tu felix Austria nube\" would have\r\nacquired a new meaning.\r\n\r\nThe phrase, \"union of Germany with Austria\" might suggest a great\r\nextension eastwards of German imperialism over Eastern Europe and Asia\r\nMinor. But a glance at the map shows that, whereas previously Germany\r\nenjoyed by alliance with Austria political control eastwards to the\r\nCarpathians and Balkans and economic control to the AEgean and Black\r\nSea, now Germany is barricaded on the east at its national frontier by\r\nstrong national States; and by union with German-Austria would receive\r\nan extension of its own national frontier not eastward but southward.\r\nThe effect of union with Austria would be to add to Germany not\r\nanother East Prussia or Silesia, but another Baden or Bavaria.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the political consequence of this geographical extension\r\nsouthward? We all know the blood differences between Southerner and\r\nNortherner in German politics. The North with a Protestant and\r\nPrussian mentality, a bureaucratic and burgher government, an\r\nefficient and energetic morale, a land of big business and big\r\nbattalions; and the south a Catholic and conservative mentality, an\r\neasy-going and eclectic morale, a land of fat farms and the fine arts.\r\nAnd war and revolution have only changed without lessening these\r\ndifferences. The new Austrian province in the south would have acted\r\nas ballast to steady the rollings of the Ship of State, top-heavy with\r\nits northern profiteers and proletariat. Nor would we be right if we\r\nassumed from the short-lived Raete-Republik of Munich that Vienna would\r\nbring an accession of strength to the Communists. It is the clerical\r\nCentrum, Parliamentary Government and Federalism that would have\r\nbenefited from the Union.\r\n\r\nAnd, not only as a community, but as individuals, Austrians would have\r\na useful political _role_ in the new German democracy. Some of us may\r\nhave noticed how the Bavarians and Rheinlaenders come to the front in\r\nGermany as liberal speakers and writers. The Austrians would have\r\nbrought a like leaven into the lump of half-baked German civilisation.\r\nThe Austrian in all the elegancies of life is as superior to the\r\nGerman as he is inferior to him in all life's efficiencies. Finally,\r\nthey would have served as interpreters and intermediaries between\r\nGermans and other races. It is as difficult to dislike an Austrian as\r\nto like a Prussian.\r\n\r\nAs to the material effect of the Union, we find that the total\r\npopulation of the German Republic after union would have been no more\r\nthan was that of the German Empire before the war. At the beginning of\r\nthe war the latter was 68 millions. Up to January, 1919, the excess of\r\ndeaths over births was 700,000, the war casualties 1.8 millions.\r\nLosses in Alsace-Lorraine, Posen and Schleswig will reduce this, at\r\nleast, to 61 millions and probably to below 60 millions.\r\nGerman-Austria cannot bring in more than 9 millions and may bring in\r\nas little as 6 millions. So that Germany would about have regained in\r\nthe south what it has lost in the east, north and west.\r\n\r\nNow, as to money. The public debt of Austria, without Hungary, was\r\n83.17 milliard kronen. This has still to be apportioned among the new\r\nnational States; but even on the most favourable basis for\r\nGerman-Austria, that of population, it will mean a debt of about 30\r\nmilliard kronen with an annual charge of 1.5 milliards. This will mean\r\na much heavier charge per head than that in Germany. The note\r\ncirculation was 37.5 milliards, of which less than 10 per cent. is\r\nsecured in gold; and a restoration of the currency will therefore be a\r\ncostly business.\r\n\r\nEconomically, German-Austria is a poor country with a few prosperous\r\nrural districts and an imperial capital. Its agriculture produces\r\nbetween half and two-thirds per acre of the average German production.\r\nIts live stock is so depleted as to be practically destroyed. Its few\r\nfactories and inferior railways are in worse condition even than the\r\nGerman, which is saying much. It has no coal supplies and no port. As\r\nto Vienna, it is difficult to say what will happen to it. It may have\r\na future as the land-port of Germany on the east, as Hamburg is on the\r\nwest, and as a commercial and financial centre for the new nations;\r\nbut for the next few years it will be in industrial and financial\r\nliquidation, as the imperial banks and businesses reorganise and\r\nredistribute themselves among the nations. Vienna's machine, motor and\r\nrailway works and the Alpine Montant Company with large iron ore\r\ndeposits, are the most important assets that go with German-Austria.\r\nOf course, there are wealthy industrial districts and mineral deposits\r\nin German-Bohemia and the Sudetic country, but the question of their\r\nunion with Germany is a different one. The Bohemian Republic is making\r\na strong bid to the industrial \"interests\" of these German districts,\r\nwhich fear the competition of Saxony should they enter the German\r\nunion. It will be interesting to see whether this alliance between\r\nplutocracy and diplomacy will avail to keep these German populations\r\npermanently in the Tchech State. But with the exception of a few\r\ndynastic, clerical and capitalistic interests, German-Austria is\r\nto-day German, not Austrian.\r\n\r\nYou would have a better idea of the difference between German-Austria\r\nand the old Austrian Empire if you had visited Dr. Hartmann, the\r\nrepresentative of German-Austria in the old Austrian Embassy in\r\nBerlin. There, in a palladian palace that was once a centre of the\r\npeculiar blend of courtly brilliance and corrupt brutality with which\r\nthe Austrian Empire kept itself going, you found a modest rather\r\nmelancholy don and a young secretary; looking like lost souls of a\r\nnational democracy buried in the sarcophagus of imperialist\r\ndiplomacy. But after a few minutes' talk you also found that these\r\nmild-mannered men represented that force that broke to fragments the\r\nIron Crown of the House of Habsburg, and that will break its way to\r\nUnion over the paper barricade of the Hall of Mirrors.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, nothing to be said for the insistence of the Supreme\r\nCouncil at Paris on delaying the union of Austro-Germany with Germany.\r\nThe forcible splitting off of East Prussia and the subjection of\r\nmillions of Germans to Polish, Tchecho-Slovak and Yugo-Slav\r\ngovernments, though indefensible in principle, may be defended by\r\npractical arguments--for instance that these German ports and lands\r\nare geographically essential to the new States, while their German\r\npopulation will be a valuable element in them. The assignment of the\r\nTyrol to Italy may have a diplomatic defence as a design to falsify\r\nfuture relations between Germans and Italians, to the advantage of\r\nFrance and England. The acquisition of German Lorraine and the Saar\r\nvalley by France may be explained by the policy of making France\r\nindustrially independent of Germany and of preventing any future\r\neconomic hegemony of Germany in Europe. An insistence on\r\nAustro-Germany entering the German Republic might have been explained\r\nas an attempt to save Germany from Bolshevism and Prussianism, and to\r\nkeep it quiet. But an insistence on Austro-Germany remaining\r\nindependent, with its corollary in the intrigues for a separate Rhine\r\nRepublic, seem to me as diplomatically ill-considered as they are\r\ndemocratically ill-conceived. We intended a material injury to German\r\nnationalists, but we have only inflicted a mortal insult on the German\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Versailles has then no elements either of permanence or\r\nof peace; because it runs counter both to facts and to forces both in\r\nthe region of national and in that of international relationships.\r\n\r\nIn the national region it stultifies its own objects most effectively.\r\nNow nationalist idealism, though existing in Germany to-day only among\r\nthe conservative gentry and a small section of upper-class\r\nprogressives, is not a negligible quantity. For nationalism has\r\ncontrol of the whole Coalition Government, the whole Press, with the\r\nexception of a few opposition Labour papers, and the whole of the\r\nFrei-Corps and the armed police. Owing to our continuation of a state\r\nof war after the armistice, the German Government has, by a logical\r\nprocess it would take too long to trace, become purely nationalist,\r\ninstead of mainly socialist and internationalist. More than that, it\r\nhas come into collision with Socialism and the German Revolution in\r\nits efforts to maintain a _regime_ such as we would recognise. The\r\nnationalist forces, that it relies on to maintain parliamentary party\r\ngovernment and the supremacy of the propertied class to the exclusion\r\nboth of Council Government and of a possible supremacy of the\r\nproletariat, were, in the first place, the more liberal bureaucracy\r\nand the officers, and in the second place the \"Frei-Corps.\" But as\r\npointed out already the Treaty we imposed on Germany forced out of the\r\nGovernment all the better elements of the bureaucratic and bourgeois\r\nclasses. While the \"Frei-Corps\" with which the Government now holds\r\nall the principal towns under military rule have as moral ideals\r\npatriotism, privilege and property, and as material inducements high\r\npay and quadruple rations. They embody not only the survivors of the\r\nofficer caste, but also the young burghers and students, hitherto the\r\nYoung Guard of revolution. Their formation was due partly to our\r\ndelusion that a professional army is necessarily democratic because we\r\nhave one, and that a short service militia is necessarily militarist\r\nbecause Germany used that method for its recovery a century ago; and\r\npartly to a reaction against the revolution in Germany itself. By now\r\nthey have become the foundation of the present parliamentary _regime_.\r\nBut the Treaty requires their reduction from over 400,000 to a quarter\r\nof that number, while it utterly discredits the nationalist Government\r\nby imposing on it humiliations such as no modern nation has ever yet\r\nundergone. Therefore, while our policy requires the maintenance of the\r\npresent German parliamentarians and their police as the only possible\r\nnative agents for the realisation of our economic exploitation of\r\nGermany, our procedure renders their retention of power materially and\r\nmorally impossible. As I myself think that the economic policy is as\r\nshortsighted as it is wrongheaded, I do not regret that the\r\nterritorial and military provisions will, unless materially modified,\r\nprevent any possibility of realising any part of it. That they will\r\nshortly revive racial and religious frontier wars in which we shall\r\nprobably be involved is a minor matter. Better we should lose more men\r\nand millions in expeditions to subject frontier provinces to their\r\nracial and religious enemies, than try to subjugate all Germany to our\r\nimperial system as we apparently aspire to do in the economic and\r\nfinancial clauses.\r\n\r\nIn the international region also the Treaty has similarly stultified\r\nitself. It depends for its execution on the acceptance by Germany not\r\nonly of its provisions but of the principles on which it is based.\r\nThese principles assume that Germany will conform Constitutionally to\r\nthe European system that we are setting up. That is that Germany will\r\nhave a parliamentary government in which the upper and middle classes\r\nwill preponderate. This Germany was quite prepared to do, and regarded\r\nits revolution chiefly as the qualification for admission to the\r\nAllied system on an equal footing. Parliamentary Government meant to\r\nGermany last winter not so much liberty as equality and\r\nfraternity--equality in the world's markets and fraternity in a League\r\nof Nations. In other words, peace and food. When Germany found that it\r\nwas to be excluded from the League and outlawed, parliamentary\r\ngovernment _a l'anglaise_ was left without a leg to stand on. It lost\r\nits right leg because nationalists reverted to militarism and its left\r\nleg because internationalists turned towards Sovietism. It can fairly\r\nbe said that the Weimar Assembly and the National Government that\r\nsigned the Treaty of Peace represented no German force but merely\r\nGerman weakness. If the Treaty is ever to be enforced it can only be\r\nso through the Reichstag, and what it stands for, and yet the Treaty\r\nhas gone out of its way to weaken the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nIn respect of such criticisms I am continually being told by my\r\nquondam diplomatic colleagues that they quite agree, but that they\r\ncould get nothing better; and, given the conditions under which they\r\nworked at Paris, they think that things might have been much worse.\r\nAnd this seems to be the line also of the American delegation, with\r\nthe exception of some bolder younger spirits who broke off into open\r\nopposition. Of course, given these conditions, they could do no\r\nbetter. But that's just what they ought to have provided against.\r\nEvery diplomatist knows, or ought to know, that the result of his\r\nnegotiations will depend on two things; his success in interpreting to\r\nand impressing on his foreign surroundings the forces he represents\r\nwhether they be ironclads or ideals; and his success in selecting such\r\nsurroundings as will be most effectively impressed. It is mainly\r\nbecause they have not learnt the second part of this lesson that\r\nAmerican diplomatists fail. It was a great discovery when we found\r\nafter years of negotiation at Washington in which either nobody got\r\nany forrarder at all or we got altogether the worst of it, that it was\r\nonly necessary to transfer the venue to The Hague or Paris or London,\r\nand American diplomacy collapsed. I am not going into detail,\r\ninteresting though it might be. But I used to explain it to myself by\r\nanalysing American diplomacy as an attitude of business instincts and\r\nmoral ideals which felt itself absurd in the cold, courtly, and\r\ncynical atmosphere of diplomacy; so, instead of imposing its own rules\r\nand standards, it either became helpless or tried hurriedly to adapt\r\nand adjust itself. We have only to read the memoirs of American\r\nAmbassadors to see that it takes a Benjamin Franklin to realise that\r\nbroadcloth and beaver are more effective at Court than gold lace and a\r\nfeathered hat. For it is this and nothing more that explains how an\r\nAmerican failed in the greatest political opportunity offered to\r\nmortal man in modern times. And if President Wilson, with all the\r\ntrumps in his hands, could win so few tricks and left the table\r\npolitically bankrupt, it may seem perhaps absurd to have expected\r\nanything from our liberal representatives, tied and bound abroad by\r\nthe chains of their secret treaties, tethered and burdened at home by\r\ntheir dependence on a conservative clique and on an imperialist\r\nnewspaper proprietor.\r\n\r\nYet, those of our rulers who wanted a real peace treaty not a mere\r\ntruce for dividing the spoils, ought to have known, what the Americans\r\ndid not, that no peace could be got through a diplomatic conference\r\nat Paris. They should, in the first place, have secured a real\r\nrepresentation of the popular forces of the British Empire, and in the\r\nsecond place, a forum where those forces could take effect. Public\r\nopinion had already provided the foundation of such a forum in the\r\ndemand for a League of Nations. The proper procedure, obviously, was\r\nto stop hostilities, subject to guarantees, and to set up a League of\r\nNations that should make peace. It would have taken little longer to\r\nget together than did the diplomatic delegations, and would certainly\r\nhave taken no longer in reaching a result. Both its constitution and\r\nits conclusions would probably have been resisted to the verge of\r\nrupture by the French and Italian Governments; but would, with the\r\nmoral sanction of the League and with the urgent pressure of the\r\nmilitary situation, have been easily enforced by the British and\r\nAmericans. MM. Clemenceau and Tardieu could override Messrs. Lloyd\r\nGeorge and Philip Kerr easily enough, for, after all, the former do\r\nstand for forces, the latter are merely phenomena. They could even\r\noverride Messrs. Wilson and Lansing, for though these did represent\r\nreal forces, they could not reproduce them in Paris. But mixed French\r\nand Italian delegations of all parties would have offered points of\r\ncontact to British and American Liberals and even to German and\r\nRussian Socialists. The cleavages between the various national\r\ninterests would have been bridged and an internationalist cement\r\nintroduced to counteract the imperialist cleavages. Of course, such a\r\nbody would not have elaborated the details of peace in a plenary\r\ndebate. It would have proceeded as national Constituent Assemblies\r\nalways have done after civil war. It would have debated and approved\r\ngeneral principles for its own permanent constitution and the\r\nresettlement of Europe, and referred them for elaboration to\r\ncommittees controlling the diplomatic experts.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that such a new and untried institution could\r\nnever have succeeded where the fine flower of diplomacy failed, or\r\nwould have been merely a stalking horse for diplomatic intrigue and\r\nimperialistic interests. But an institution is strong in proportion to\r\nthe public powers it has acquired and the public acquiescence in them:\r\nnot in proportion to its degree of constitutional development, or the\r\nperfection of its machinery. A British parish council, with its\r\ncarefully defined powers, can do little and does nothing. A German\r\nrevolutionary communal council could do anything and does a good deal.\r\nThe League of Nations would have given the Americans a means of\r\nexpressing their moral and neutral policies and of exercising the\r\npressure that President Wilson would not or could not apply. Even if\r\nthe League had not succeeded in imposing respect for his \"fourteen\r\npoints\" on the diplomats, and it might have done so, it would at least\r\nhave regulated procedure. We should not have had vital decisions\r\nreached in a few minutes' talk one afternoon, and reversed for some\r\nunknown reason the next, without reference to expert conclusions or\r\nregard for principle and precedent. Also this procedure would have\r\nmade it possible to deal with our main obstacles to a permanent peace,\r\nthe secret treaties. We could not escape from these national\r\ndiplomatic obligations in a diplomatic conference of national\r\ndelegates. But we could have got a dispensation from them had they\r\nbeen referred to a supreme international and super-diplomatic\r\nauthority. No doubt this procedure would have affected such questions\r\nas the international status of Germany and Ireland or India. Germany\r\nwould have been admitted to the League in time to take part in\r\narranging its own penalties and we should thereby have got the best\r\nguarantee possible for the permanence of the peace in respect to\r\nGermany. The Peace Treaty would thus have become a compact instead of\r\na Coercion Act. As to Ireland, it is outside my scope: but as our\r\nnational authority avowedly finds reconciliation of the two Irish\r\nfactions insoluble, there would seem to be no great harm in trying\r\nwhat an international authority could do.\r\n\r\nOn such lines as this, a League of Nations might have been\r\nestablished. As things are the League is, of course, no more than an\r\nalliance to enforce the imperialist and nationalist decisions of Paris\r\non conquered races, and to combat revolution. It is a combination of a\r\nBalkan League and a Holy Alliance. The effect of this prostitution of\r\na public ideal to the profiteering of the Paris conclave has made the\r\npeace as disastrous morally to Europe as was the war materially. The\r\nTreaties have, for a time, Bolshevised Eastern Europe, Balkanised\r\nCentral Europe and Bottomleyised Western Europe.\r\n\r\nBut here we are concerned with the effect on Germany. And if it be\r\nobjected that it does not matter what Germany thinks of it, I reply\r\nthat the test of the League's utility will be the confidence that it\r\ncan inspire in the former enemy States. Unless Germans, Bulgars, and\r\neven Bolsheviks, see in it something more than a League against\r\nthemselves, they will not accept its authority and we are back on a\r\nbasis of a balance of power.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Germany in this respect are especially important.\r\nWe went into the war for international ideals--the defence of France\r\nand the abolition of militarism; and, having fought it to a\r\nconclusion, we allowed our rulers to substitute for that\r\ninternationalism the worst form of imperialism. Germany went into the\r\nwar for imperialist ideals, or, at best, for nationalist ideals; but\r\nafter defeat replaced those ideals by an internationalism involving\r\nthe acceptance of international control by a League of Nations. That\r\ninternationalist point of view is still held by the German people,\r\nthough no one would think it from the character of their present\r\nGovernment, and the tone of their Press.\r\n\r\nThe internationalist point of view of the German people has so far\r\nfailed to find expression for two reasons: one was the pressure of\r\nAllied imperialism, the other the partial failure of the German\r\nRevolution through the innate political incapacity of the people. The\r\narmistice, while nominally suspending hostilities, really continued the\r\nwar on national lines. This treaty, while nominally restoring peace,\r\nreally continues the war on imperial lines. Under these conditions\r\nGerman internationalism could scarcely survive except among the working\r\nclass, where it was too deeply rooted in the realities of life for any\r\npoison gas from Paris to kill it. But, except among the workmen and\r\ntheir idealist leaders, the Independent Socialists, the feeling that the\r\nworld in general, and Germany in particular, was at the mercy of the\r\nimperialist and nationalist elements among the victors caused the\r\nabandonment of the new protestantism--internationalism, and reversion to\r\nthe old orthodoxy--nationalism. This recantation was indeed in response\r\nto intimations from Paris that Germany was expected to renounce the\r\ndevil Bolshevism and all its works. That the realisation of the German\r\nRevolution, whether it is the work of a devil or no, is the one and only\r\nprotection for Germany against Bolshevism is, of course, beyond the\r\npolitical penetration of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe principal force of public opinion created by the sacrifices of the\r\nwar expressed itself in the movement for a League of Nations to\r\nguarantee peace. In Germany this movement was especially strong. For\r\nGermany was left without other protection than that which it could get\r\nfrom such internationalism. Any suggestion that could strengthen the\r\nLeague or Germany's claim to participate in it was eagerly grasped.\r\n\r\nA private suggestion that the German Constitution should contain a\r\nformal recognition of the League and be the first national\r\nconstitution to do so, was at once adopted by the very cautious and\r\nconservative Committee. Another from a similar source that the German\r\nproposals for the League should correct the democratic deficiencies of\r\nthe Paris project was also adopted. The German scheme for a League\r\nwas, indeed, in every respect better than that of the Allies.[I] But\r\nthe Paris project and the provisions of the Treaty hopelessly\r\nprejudiced the whole idea of the League with German progressives.\r\nAfter their publication the clause recognising the precepts of the\r\nLeague and the provisions of Treaties as the supreme law of the land\r\ndisappeared[J] from Art. 4 of the Constitution. The League of Paris\r\nand the Treaty of Versailles are now to be obeyed as \"force\r\nmajeure\"--they are not recognised as German law. And whereas the\r\nLeague could have secured from Germany a willing acceptance of\r\nobligations that would not only have guaranteed the peace of Europe so\r\nfar as the German race was concerned, but would also have made good to\r\nsome extent the ruin of the last war, now it is looked upon throughout\r\nGermany as mere cynical camouflage. The German, whether nationalist or\r\ninternationalist, listens to American or English preachments about the\r\nLeague with despair and disgust.\r\n\r\nHere is one such opinion from my note book: \"I can endure with\r\npatience Germany being robbed of everything that is easily rob-able\r\nand even its being reduced to economic servitude. But what I cannot\r\nstand is the confidence trick of Wilson's 'points' and the camouflage\r\nof the League of Nations. Bismarck in respect of his Emperor and\r\nBethmann-Hollweg in respect of Belgium both committed a breach of\r\ntrust, but they did it under necessity of war. Wilson in his Fourteen\r\nPoints and Lord Robert Cecil in the League have done the same in the\r\nname of peace.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the internationalism of Germany and Central Europe is under\r\nthe pressure of Paris, taking a form almost impossible to reconcile\r\nwith the form of this League of Nations. Until the appearance of the\r\nParis project for the League and the peace conditions, Germany,\r\nwhether national or international, was wholeheartedly a supporter of\r\nit. But now it is not too much to say that the League is moribund, not\r\nonly in Germany, but in continental Europe generally, as an ideal. Its\r\nplace is rapidly being taken by the ideal of an International Council\r\non a basis of social and industrial representation, instead of that of\r\na League on a basis of national or territorial representation. Just as\r\nthe leaders of the German workmen and the younger Democrats caught at\r\nthe theories of Guild Socialism, so now they are turning eagerly to a\r\nnew idea, also introduced from England, of an international Soviet\r\nsystem--an organisation that will be really international because,\r\ninstead of being based as is the Wilsonian League on the nationalism\r\nof States, it will be based on the internationalism of trades. That\r\nwill have as its sanction an international strike instead of a\r\nnational boycott, and as its authority a Central Council of delegates\r\ninstead of a Conference of diplomats. This development would have come\r\nin due course anyway, but a successful Wilsonian League might have\r\ndelayed it even as the prestige of the House of Commons is delaying\r\nCouncil government, and as the prestige of the Crown delayed\r\nParliamentary government itself.\r\n\r\nTo us Liberals and Labour folk here in England--relieved at getting a\r\nLeague in any form and ready as we English always are to make the best\r\nof what we've got, however bad--this international Council movement\r\nmay seem to be a waste of strength. For it would seem likely to\r\nrequire the full force of all progressive continental movements to get\r\nthe League of Nations put on a democratic basis. But the attitude of\r\nAmerica makes it doubtful whether the League can be so developed as to\r\ndo more good than harm. And in any case the movement for an\r\nInternational Council will proceed concurrently and will help rather\r\nthan harm the movement for an International Parliament. Nor will it\r\nencounter the same difficulties. The international organisation of\r\nlabour provides a better medium in which to establish an international\r\ninstitution than does the present international organisation of\r\ngovernments--the Foreign Offices and Foreign Missions. Moreover, it\r\nshould prove as easy to extend a Soviet System or Council Commonwealth\r\ninto the international relationship as it is difficult and dangerous\r\nto extend the principle of State Sovereignty and Parliamentary\r\nsupremacy there. The Council Commonwealth, with its essentially\r\ninternational basis, with its democracy of superimposed councils in\r\nconstant contact with each other and with the international strike for\r\nsanction, is as sound and safe a foundation for such a superstructure\r\nas the Parliamentary State, with its long-term parliaments, its large\r\nconstituencies, its all-dominating national sentiment and its national\r\nblockade or boycott, is unsound. Anyway, the International Industrial\r\nCongress and Executive Council are bound to come, either in\r\nsubstitution for or supplementary to the League of Nations, just as\r\nthe National Council Congress and Central Council are bound to come\r\neither in substitution for or supplementary to the parliamentary\r\nsystems. The only question is whether they will come as supplementary\r\nto or in substitution for the League.\r\n\r\nAs to the sop thrown to the workmen of the world in Section 8 of the\r\nTreaty, with its international labour organisation, the German\r\nworkmen, at least, have no use for it. The revolutionaries with their\r\nIndependent leaders would not probably co-operate at all in the\r\nproceedings at Washington now beginning. The Trades Unionists and\r\nSocial-Democrats have done so, but under no illusions as to results. A\r\ncriticism of their organ, _Vorwaerts_, points out that this section is\r\ninspired by as profound a distrust of the Proletariat as the rest of\r\nthe Treaty shows of Prussia; and that the provisions as to submission\r\nof agenda some months before, as to veto by the Governments except\r\nwhen there is a two-thirds majority, while the workmen's\r\nrepresentation is no more than a fourth, and as to enforcing\r\ndecisions, deprive the whole section of most of its value. The\r\n_Vorwaerts_, representing the general point of view now dominant in\r\nGermany and the point of view which but for other influences would\r\nhave given the most sympathetic supporters to such procedure as that\r\nproposed, now damns it as humbug.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the form of the eventual international institution may\r\nbe, one fact must be faced. We have not yet made peace with Germany.\r\nIf the Paris treaties with Germany, Austria and Bulgaria have appeased\r\nthe angry passions excited by war and finally discredited secret\r\ndiplomacy, they will have fulfilled a function and cleared the road\r\nfor peace. The armistice demands were the first stage to peace--these\r\ndiplomatic damnifications the second. What will be the third and last?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] This telegram had, I believe, a curious backlash, rather\r\nillustrative of the times in Germany. A countess with political\r\nambitions, who had set up an Independent salon, had had that Friday her\r\nusual \"evening,\" at which I had looked in for a few minutes. On Monday\r\nshe was arrested and banished to a provincial townlet for supplying\r\nfalse information to a foreign correspondent. Needless to say, one did\r\nnot need a countess to tell one that Germany would sign in its collapsed\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[I] In the German project all signatories of the Hague Convention as\r\nwell as the new States arisen since the war were admitted. Instead of\r\nall authority being assigned to an Executive Council of nine in which\r\nthe victorious Great Powers reserved themselves a majority of five, the\r\nremaining four being elected by smaller States, the German project had\r\nthe Executive Council elected by a Congress of States, corresponding to\r\nthe Assembly of Delegates in the Paris project. It also provided a World\r\nParliament of parliamentary delegations. The German project is also more\r\ndrastic in its provisions for mediation, arbitration, and protection of\r\nminorities. It approaches the functions of the League for international\r\nsocial legislation in a much more liberal and constructive spirit.\r\n\r\n[J] This article of the Constitution had been amended by the addition of\r\nthe words in italics: \"The generally accepted principles of\r\ninternational law _the pronouncements of the League of Nations and the\r\nprovisions of Treaties_ have binding force as German Constitutional\r\nLaw.\" It has now been amended back by their omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at the new German Constitution, without troubling about its\r\ninner meanings, and comparing it with the Constitution of 1871, we are\r\nstruck at once by the very considerable advance it represents in\r\ndemocratic development. One need not be a constitutional lawyer to\r\nassert with confidence that this is the most democratic Constitution\r\npossessed by any of the principal European peoples, and to add that it\r\nseems to have avoided many of the mistakes that have been marked in\r\nother Republican Constitutions, whether American, French, Portuguese\r\nor Russian. The President's powers, for example, and the relation of\r\nthe Ministry to Parliament suggest that Dr. Preuss, the constitutional\r\njurist responsible for its drafting and elaboration, had studied\r\nforeign constitutional history with a Prussian thoroughness and a\r\nHebrew perspicacity.\r\n\r\nBut a closer study of this Constitution will give us a different view\r\nof it. And this view will depend on whether we study it in the light\r\nof its development from the Revolution or of its difference from the\r\n_ancien regime_. If we compare it with the principles of the\r\nrevolution we shall be tempted to condemn and reject it, like the\r\nGerman Revolution, as mere camouflaged reaction. It would certainly\r\nhave been a very different document had it been produced in the first\r\nweeks of November. The Revolution, in so far as it had a\r\nconstitutional conception at all, contemplated a \"Raete system\" (that\r\nis a Council Government), which should secure political power to the\r\nproletariat under a Central Committee, on the Russian model. If it had\r\nadmitted Parliamentary institutions at all they would only have been\r\nsubordinate to Council control. As to any survival of the old State\r\nsovereignties, they were looked on as having disappeared with the\r\nState dynasties from which they had originated. Thus the Erfurt\r\nproclamation of the Thuringian States on December 10th, 1918, proposed\r\nthat the motley medley of those petty principalities be unified into\r\none administrative department of a centralised Republic.\r\n\r\nBut this revolutionary impetus did not last. As power relapsed to the\r\nupper and middle classes particularism reappeared. As the flood tide\r\nof revolution drained back, the old channels and watersheds appeared\r\nagain. Every crisis in modern German history, 1848, 1866 and 1870, had\r\nbeen in the main a movement towards national unity that eventually\r\nfailed in great measure owing to peculiarities of German character and\r\nof Germany's circumstances. And this last Revolution of 1918 was to a\r\nlarge extent the same; but whereas the previous movements had been\r\nthwarted by Conservative ideals and institutions, and by the citadels\r\nof the past, this movement was most embarrassed by its association\r\nwith Communist ideals and innovations, like the Councils. So much\r\nindeed was this national and centralising factor of the Revolution\r\nobscured by the international and socialising feature of it that, at\r\nthe election of the Constitutional Assembly, such questions as to\r\nwhether the Constitution should be that of a centralised Republic,\r\nlike France, or a coalition of Republics, like Switzerland, never came\r\nbefore the public at all.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was too much occupied with the Revolution in its effect\r\non private life and property, on food and peace, to consider it in its\r\ncharacter as another chapter in the history of German unity. The\r\nresult of the election, however, temporarily settled the issue\r\nagainst centralisation by splitting the Socialist party, and making\r\nthe moderate Socialist Government dependent on the support of clerical\r\nand sectional interests. The constructive impetus of the Revolution\r\nwas lost and Constitution-making became once more, as on previous\r\noccasions, a complicated negotiation with the lesser States.\r\n\r\nBut the Revolution had at least succeeded in giving the Constitution a\r\ngood start towards centralisation by having a draft prepared, by a\r\nCommittee under Dr. Preuss, then Secretary of State for the Interior\r\nin the provisional Government. This first draft--a shapeless makeshift\r\naffair--nevertheless established certain principles of national unity\r\nwhich eventually survived all attacks on them. And a tactical success\r\nwas scored at once by publishing this draft simultaneously with the\r\ndecision of the Constituent Assembly, on the 21st of January. But that\r\nwas as far as the matter could be carried without calling the States\r\ninto consultation, and a conference of their representatives met in\r\nBerlin on January 24th. At this Conference, or rather in the special\r\ntrain on the way to it, the particularist opposition declared itself.\r\nAnd this, not only where it might have been expected, in the clerical,\r\nliberal and conservative parties, but among socialists themselves.\r\nThis opposition of southern socialists followed the line of an old\r\nfactious schism in the Social Democratic party that had declared\r\nitself at the Nuernberg Conference, and was headed by Kurt Eisner, the\r\nleading revolutionary and real ruler of Bavaria. Kurt Eisner was not\r\nonly opposed to Prussia on political but on personal grounds, having\r\nshaken the dust of Berlin off his feet some years before. Under his\r\nleadership the centralised Republic of Preuss was gradually remodelled\r\ninto a decentralised Federation of Republics. And it looked, at one\r\ntime, as though the failure of the Paulskirche Assembly was to be\r\nrepeated, and a movement towards German unity and social liberty was\r\nto relapse and recoil into reaction. Fortunately there has been to-day\r\nno Bismarck to profit by the opportunity given by the Southern\r\nparticularists.[K]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how the resignation of the Constituent States\r\nchanges in the successive drafts of the Constitution. First they\r\nappear as \"Member States\" (_glied Staaten_), then as \"Free States,\"\r\nfinally as \"Countries\" (_Lander_). Again, we find the Federal Body or\r\nSenate, representing these States, as States, appearing first as a\r\nState Committee (_Staaten Auschuss_), then as a State House (_Staaten\r\nHaus_) sharing sovereignty with a _Volks Haus_ or Commons and\r\ncombining with it to form the Reichstag, and finally as a Council of\r\nthe Realm (_Reichsrat_) with merely a suspensory veto over the\r\nReichstag. These changes of nomenclature suggest a reaction into\r\ndecentralisation followed by a recoil back into centralisation. The\r\nsuccessive drafts of this Constitution are indeed documents of intense\r\ninterest to a student of German political development and of\r\nrevolution in general. They mark stages in a historic movement that is\r\nscarcely elsewhere recorded; if only because its course was so rapid\r\nthat it accomplished in weeks what would normally have taken years,\r\nand because post-war conditions cut it off from competent observation.\r\nBut, by comparing the various drafts of the Constitution, we see how a\r\nproletarian revolution starting in Prussia in favour of a centralised\r\nconsolidated Republic gradually yielded to a reaction favouring\r\nSouthern particularism, which converted the Constitution into a\r\ndecentralised federation of Republics. Then, with the capture of the\r\nSaxon and Bavarian States, by the revolutionary Council movement and\r\ntheir collapse under Prussian military occupation, came the final\r\nphase in which centralisation recovered most of its lost ground. The\r\nquestion is whether this ground has been recovered for reaction or for\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThis raises the question, all important for our purpose, as to the\r\nposition of Prussian reaction under the new Constitution. Prussia as a\r\npolitical Power stands to us for Prussianism, and Prussianism\r\nrepresents the political point of view that we have been fighting in\r\nthis war.\r\n\r\nIn the past Prussia dominated Germany through the Dynasty and the\r\nruling class. Prussia was a force making for reaction, owing to its\r\nantiquated suffrage and constitution and to the activities of its\r\nupper and middle classes. Prussia still dominates the German Republic\r\nmuch as England would dominate in a British Federation. But it is not\r\nthe same Prussia. If Prussia is still the citadel of reaction it is\r\nalso the centre of revolution. The fight between the two is not yet\r\nfought out, but if, as seems probable, neither wins, the result will\r\nbe that the Prussian influence in new Germany will be a somewhat\r\ncolourless compromise, what we should call Liberalism.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, and the course of recent events tends to confirm a\r\nconjecture made soon after my arrival in Germany, then a\r\ncentralisation that tends to maintain Prussian hegemony in Germany is\r\nnot in principle objectionable. It remains to be seen whether the\r\nConstitution as now recentralised offers opportunities to a\r\nrecrudescence of Prussianism in the bad sense.\r\n\r\nThe position of Prussia, having four-sevenths of the population, an even\r\nlarger proportion of the ruling class and of the military caste, also\r\nthe capital and the civil service, was the main difficulty of the\r\nConstitution-makers. The revolutionary solution was at first the\r\npartition of Prussia, and it seemed feasible enough. Prussian unity had\r\ncentred more than that of any other German State in the Crown; and as\r\nthe Prussian Revolution had three main distinct regions, not very\r\ndifferent from the old racial divisions, a division of the State into\r\nthree seemed as easy as expedient. Dr. Preuss and constitutional jurists\r\nof all parties stood in favour of such partition. At the same time, if\r\nPrussia were to be partitioned, obviously a rearrangement of the other\r\nStates might be attempted, so as to give the new German Constitution\r\nthat uniformity and precision so precious to the German mind.\r\nAccordingly, all manner of fancy schemes were put forward by which the\r\nReich was divided geographically, racially, religiously, economically,\r\nand even industrially. But all the time the Revolution, that alone\r\ncould have carried through any such reconstruction, was being thwarted\r\nand throttled, so that none of these schemes became practical politics.\r\nThe revolutionary impetus that the Constitution-makers could use for the\r\nrealisation of their reconstructive ideals proved far too weak. There\r\nwere, however, plenty of interested efforts to abolish the anomalies and\r\nabsurdities of the old dynastic frontiers. Thus Hamburg merchants wished\r\nto annex Bremen; Brunswick revolutionaries wished to annex Anhalt;\r\nCoburg councils declared their independence of Gotha councils; Waldeck\r\nburghers clamoured for release from the tyranny of Pyrmont. But when it\r\ncame to effecting any such change, in no case was there sufficient\r\nsupport. It would indeed have been easier to redivide Germany on\r\naltogether new lines than to partition up and patch together the old\r\nStates. Dr. Preuss was, at a very early stage, obliged to restrict\r\nhimself to laying down principles for procedure which should make\r\nsubsequent rearrangements as easy as possible; and he was eventually\r\nobliged to content himself with putting, as he himself said, the least\r\npossible obstacle in the way of change.\r\n\r\nThe whole policy of partitioning Prussia very soon broke down before a\r\nPrussian, national unity that was the growth of centuries. This\r\nnational sentiment expressed itself in violent opposition not only\r\nfrom the Prussian ruling class, to whom Prussian unity was a necessary\r\ncondition for a monarchical and militarist reaction, but also to the\r\nPrussian proletariat, who considered it a necessary condition for the\r\nsuccess of the Revolution. Nor, oddly enough, was it favoured even by\r\nthe Southern and Catholic interest who in the past had been most\r\njealous of Prussia. For they argued that if Prussia were reduced to\r\nprovincial departments, their own State rights would not remain\r\nunrestricted. And State right had become all the more precious to the\r\nclerical parties since revolution had threatened them both from above\r\nand below, from a Socialist Central Government above and from\r\nCommunist Council Governments below. Partition had therefore to be\r\nabandoned and the difficulty of Prussian preponderance was solved by\r\nan arbitrary reduction of Prussian representation, as in the\r\nConstitution of 1871. In the old Bundesrat Prussia was represented by\r\n17 votes out of 61 (counting Alsace-Lorraine). Art. 61 of the present\r\nConstitution restricts Prussia to two-fifths of the total votes,\r\nhaving raised the proportion from one-third in the previous drafts.\r\nThat is, Prussia used to have rather more than a quarter, and now has\r\nrather more than a third of the votes in the Federal body.\r\n\r\nThis might look like a reaction into Prussianism; but only until the\r\nfunctions of this Federal Body are examined. Sovereignty, under the\r\nold Constitution, resided in the dynasties, and the old Bundesrat was\r\na council of diplomatic delegates, comparable to the Supreme Council\r\nat Paris. These delegates, as representatives of the Crown,\r\nintervened, not only in legislative but even in administrative\r\nmatters, such as appointments. Moreover, in this Council, the Prussian\r\nrepresentatives had a privileged position, as they received their\r\ninstructions from the Prussian Government in which the Imperial\r\nChancellor was Premier. In the first drafts of the Constitution we\r\nfind the sovereignty divided between representatives of the State and\r\nrepresentatives of the people. Thus the Staatenhaus and Volkshaus\r\ncombine to make the sovereign Reichstag. But in the present\r\nConstitution, all sovereignty expressly resides in the popular\r\nChamber, the Reichstag. The Reichsrat becomes no more than a sort of\r\nImperial Conference with defined and carefully delimited\r\nconstitutional powers; and, in the Reichsrat, Prussia has no\r\nprivileged position whatever.\r\n\r\nThe great strength of Prussianism was in the Prussian Constitution and\r\nin the Crown. But Art. 17 now prescribes that every State must have a\r\nConstitution as a Free State of a democratic character. And as to the\r\nCrown, Prussia has not the same relations to the President as it had\r\nto the Emperor. The Kaiser was primarily King of Prussia by right\r\ndivine, the President is primarily executive of Germany by popular\r\nelection.[L] Moreover, under the old _regime_, the Kaiser's Chancellor\r\nwas also Prussian Premier. The Republic's Chancellor has nothing to\r\nsay to Prussia; he and the Ministers form a Federal Cabinet\r\nresponsible to the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nAnd, if we carry this comparison into other political regions, we find\r\nthe same result; that Prussianism and Junkerism have lost their\r\nvantage grounds and have been put under democratic control.\r\n\r\nIn Foreign Affairs the influence of Prussia was, as we have cause to\r\nknow, especially fatal to Germany and to Europe. But that is now at an\r\nend. The German Constitution not only affords the usual guarantees of\r\nParliamentary Government for a democratic foreign policy, but guards\r\nthe nation against defects in those guarantees that have been found\r\ndangerous even in our own Constitution. Two innovations have for years\r\nbeen urged by reformers in our own country, the institution of a\r\npermanent parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, and the\r\nsubmission of important treaties, as well as of declaration of war, to\r\nParliament. Had Germany had these safeguards at the time of the war\r\nthere would have been no war. Had we had them then we should now have\r\npeace. Articles 35 and 45 of the German Constitution are worthy of our\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe financial relationship between States and the Central Government\r\nis always a difficult matter to arrange. If the Federal Government is\r\ndependent on subsidies from the States, it can have no strength, nor\r\neven any real democratic basis. If the States depend on the Central\r\nGovernment, they have no vitality and become in time mere\r\nadministrative departments. Under the old Constitution there was no\r\nclear principle, but the fiscal authority resided nominally in the\r\nStates, while the Reich really by all manner of devices encroached on\r\nthis autonomy. Now there is a clear general principle that the States\r\nmust content themselves with such sources of revenue as are left to\r\nthem by the Reich. And we certainly cannot criticise a centralisation\r\nwhich is indispensable to Germany in the enormous effort it must make\r\nto meet the financial obligations imposed on it by the Treaty of\r\nVersailles. Moreover, Prussia can no longer dominate Germany\r\nfinancially and economically as before. Prussia's economic\r\npreponderance has been greatly reduced by the loss of Lorraine, the\r\nSaar, and Silesia. In communications, too, Prussia can no longer give\r\nthe lead and lay down the law to the lesser States; for communications\r\ncome under federal control. Within two years railroads, posts and\r\ntelegraphs and canals are transferred to the Reich.\r\n\r\nIn the region of public welfare we find that the new German\r\nConstitution is more satisfactory than might have been expected from\r\nthe conditions of its genesis. It meets adequately two main requisites\r\nfor progress; the formulation of the general principles inspiring the\r\npractical provisions of recent progressive legislation, and the\r\nattribution of responsibility for further legislative development of\r\nsuch principles. Thus, besides establishment of equality of sexes, we\r\nfind such principles as that \"Marriage is established on the equality\r\nof the sexes.\" \"Families with numerous children are entitled to\r\nequitable and equalising treatment.\" \"Motherhood is entitled to\r\nprotection of and provision by the State\" (Art. 19). Illegitimate\r\nchildren are to have \"similar conditions for their corporal, spiritual\r\nand social development\" (Art. 121), \"Childhood is to be protected\r\nagainst exploitation\" (Art. 122), and so forth. While all these\r\nquestions are attributed to the Reichstag (Art. 7, Sec. 7).\r\n\r\nThe same approbation can safely be accorded to the chapter on public\r\nwork. The economic purpose of society is to \"guarantee to all an\r\nexistence proper to men.\" \"Property has its obligations, and its use\r\nmust also serve the common good.\" While these _voeux pieux_ are given\r\nmore definite application in provisions for housing and contributory\r\ninsurance, and in recognition of \"nationalisation\" in Art. 156.\r\nMoreover, these principles are, to some extent, guaranteed by the\r\npreviously discussed recognition of Industrial Councils in Art. 165,\r\nwhich provides a measure of \"socialisation,\" and by the specific\r\nrecognition of socialisation as a principle in Art. 7, Sec. 13.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the all-important region of education, the conditions\r\nof compromise in which the Constitution took shape have prevented the\r\nestablishment of any very clear principle or very cut and dried\r\nprocedure. This was indeed one of the most contentious chapters of\r\nwhich 'clericalism' contested every inch. The Democrats and Dr. Preuss\r\nhad originally introduced a uniform and secular system; but they and\r\nthe Social-Democrats, in the abstention of the Independents, were\r\nunable to carry this through against the Clerical Centrum. The\r\nresultant compromise is not unlike that now prevailing in England. It\r\nmay work but it satisfies nobody.\r\n\r\nAnd finally coming to the army the effect of the success secured by\r\nthe centralising party is even more questionable. The Revolution\r\noriginally contemplated merely a militia on the Swiss model, under\r\nFederal control. The first result of reaction was to substitute a\r\nprofessional and highly paid force, the Frei-Corps, under Prussian\r\ncommand and control. The consequence of this was that the Southern\r\nStates insisted on retaining their separate military systems, and\r\nthese were duly recognised in the early drafts of the Constitution, to\r\nthe great disgust of nationalists and militarists. But then came the\r\nproclamation of Raete-Republics in Saxony and Bavaria, and their\r\nsuppression by Prussian Frei-Corps with some assistance from\r\nWuertemberg and Baden. This re-established, _de facto_, a military\r\npredominance of Prussia which enabled the Prussian jurists to replace\r\nmilitary matters under the Federal Government. Art. 79 now gives\r\ncomplete authority to the Minister of Defence; and the special\r\nmilitary autonomies of Bavaria and other States, reserved in previous\r\ndrafts, disappear. But, so long as the Frei-Corps continue, with their\r\nPrussian organisation and officers, a Federal army is, for the\r\npresent, at least, nothing else than a Prussian army. Though Noske is\r\nthe Minister of Defence, not Minister of War, as he is sometimes\r\ncalled, and is a member of a Federal Cabinet and not, as before, a\r\nPrussian Minister, and though the Eden Hotel clique has been\r\ntransferred to the Ministry of Defence--yet the armed forces of the\r\nRepublic are, for the present, the armed forces of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, a transition stage. The Prussian officer is the\r\ncreation of conditions that no longer exist to-day, and the Frei-Corps\r\na creation of conditions that will not exist to-morrow. When Germany\r\nagain gets peace, Prussia will lose a predominance that it owes to\r\npast conditions, but not to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed in its efficiency as a bond between the past and the\r\nfuture that the Constitution must be judged; as a bond that will\r\nreduce revolution to rapid evolution. Dr. Preuss, its author, claims\r\nno more for it than that it will not act as a bar to any normal and\r\nnatural growth. But it will have to do more than this. It must serve\r\nas a bridge by which Germany can safely pass over the immense gulf\r\nthat separates the Germany of yesterday from the Germany of to-morrow;\r\nthe Germany of the Courts of Potsdam and of Pumpernickel, from the\r\nGermany of the Executive Councils of Berlin and Brunswick. It is a\r\nformidable span for any bridge, and, when we look at this Constitution\r\nand find one abutment of it in Article 65 consecrating an\r\nultra-mediaeval particularism, and the other abutment in Article 165\r\n\"anchoring\" the ultra-modern forms of industrial councils, we may\r\nwonder whether the intervening structure will ever stand the strain.\r\nCan the constitutional compromise of Dr. Preuss ever safely convey\r\nseventy million people from government by the divine right of princes\r\nto government by industrial representation? Even if it does not, and\r\nthis Constitution is swept away by a second flood-tide of revolution,\r\nit will have served a purpose. It will have finally exorcised the\r\nconstitutional incubus of northern Prussianism and southern\r\nparticularism. The vague and dangerous powers of Prussian imperial\r\nsovereignty and the less dangerous but equally disabling national\r\nsovereignties of the Principalities have been swept away. Art. 11 of\r\nthe Constitution establishes the Commonwealth as a Republic and\r\nassigns its sovereignty to the people.[M] Moreover, Art. 178 repeals\r\nthe Constitution of 1871, while Art. 181 puts the Constitution in\r\nforce on the authority of the National Assembly alone, thereby finally\r\nending the claim put forward at first by Bavaria that it should be\r\nratified by the Landtag.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Constitution of 1919 and that of 1871 can\r\nindeed best be seen at a glance by comparing their preambles. Here is\r\nthat of 1871. \"H.M. the King of Prussia in the name of the North\r\nGerman Confederation, H.M. the King of Bavaria, H.M. the King of\r\nWuertemberg, H.R.H. the Grand Duke of Baden and H.R.H. the Grand Duke\r\nof Hesse and by Rhine, for those parts of the Grand Dukedom of Hesse\r\nSouth of the Rhine, conclude a perpetual confederation.\"\r\n\r\nCompare that with the preamble of this Constitution. \"The German\r\npeople, united in its races, and inspired by the will to restore and\r\nreinforce its Realm in liberty and equity, to ensure peace, both\r\ninward and outward, and to further social progress, has accorded\r\nitself this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIt only remains therefore, for Europe and England to recognise this\r\nnew departure and to ratify it by admitting Germany to the League of\r\nNations. And even if this new Constitution be held to be no more than\r\nnew wine in old bottles and new patches on an old garment, that is no\r\nreason why Germany should not be included in the League as at present\r\nconceived and constituted.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] Delbrueck, the leader of the Right, who defended Bismarck's\r\nConstitution in the Assembly against the supporters of the present\r\nConstitution, ignored the fundamental difference caused by the fall of\r\nthe dynasties. Even Bismarck could not have succeeded had he not had the\r\nKing of Prussia, the Emperor of Austria and the Princes of Germany on\r\nwhich to build his structure.\r\n\r\n[L] It was at first proposed, when decentralisation was at its\r\nstrongest, that each State should have its own President, and that the\r\nReichs President and Prussian President should be kept separate. But\r\nthere is as yet no Prussian President, nor does there seem likely to be\r\none.\r\n\r\n[M] The sovereignty of the Southern States was always a danger to German\r\nunity, as in the last crisis when great efforts were made by France to\r\nstart secession movements in the South and West. The diplomatic right of\r\nrepresentation was also an embarrassment in every crisis; as when a\r\nBavarian representative suddenly appeared at Brest-Litovsk in the high\r\ntide of reaction, or again at Berne in the height of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution of 9 November, 1918, the Constitution in force\r\nwas that of 16 April, 1871--the \"Constitution of the German Reich,\"\r\nwhich had replaced the \"Constitution of the German Bund\" of November,\r\n1870. But the following Constitution has less in common with these\r\nlater Constitutions, based on alliances between Sovereign Princes,\r\nthan with the abortive \"Constitution of the German Reich\" of 28 March,\r\n1849, which embodied the nationalist and democratic revolution of\r\n1848.\r\n\r\nThe November revolution brought to power a provisional Government--the\r\nCouncil of People's Commissaries--which in its first proclamation of\r\n12 November, 1918, announced that the future Constitution would be\r\nframed by a National Assembly elected by universal suffrage and\r\nproportional representation. Under electoral regulations of 30\r\nNovember, 1918, elections were held on 19 January, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly met in Weimar on 6 February, 1919, and on 10\r\nFebruary voted the Provisional Constitution; whereupon the Council of\r\nCommissaries resigned their authority to the Assembly. This\r\nConstitution gave the Assembly sole power to vote the Constitution;\r\nbut its provisions could only be submitted with consent of a \"State\r\nCommittee\" of representatives of the \"Free States.\" This provisional\r\nConstitution was supplemented by an \"Interim Act\" of 4 March, which\r\nmaintained in force previous legislation of the Reich and decrees of\r\nthe Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nThe drafting of the Constitution was entrusted to Dr. Hugo Preuss,\r\nProfessor of Public Law in the Commercial University of Berlin,\r\nSecretary of the Interior in the Provisional Government, and Minister\r\nof the Interior in the first Coalition Government. The Democratic\r\nParty, of which he is a member, having left the Coalition on the\r\nquestion of signature of the Treaty of Versailles, Dr. Preuss retained\r\nresponsibility for the passage of the Constitution as Special\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe first draft of the Constitution was published in January and was\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly on 21 February. It was introduced by Preuss\r\nwith lengthy expositions in sessions on 28 February and 3 and 4 March,\r\nand thereafter submitted to a Committee of twenty-eight under the\r\nPresidency of the deputy Conrad Haussmann. After being completely\r\nrecast in Committee it was debated in second reading 2-22 July; when\r\nthe status of the Free States, the education question, and the\r\nrecognition of industrial Councils were especially contested and\r\neventually compromised. The third reading, 29-31 July, ended in its\r\nbeing voted by 262 to 75, the minority consisting of the Conservatives\r\nand the Independent Socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE GERMAN REALM\r\n\r\nThe German people united in its every branch and inspired by the\r\ndetermination to renew and establish the Realm in liberty and justice,\r\nto ensure peace at home and abroad, and to further social progress,\r\nhas given itself this Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PART\r\n\r\nTHE REALM: ITS ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nREALM AND LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1.\r\n\r\nThe German Realm is a Republic.[1]\r\n\r\nConstitutional power proceeds from the people.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 2.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Realm consists of the territories of the German\r\nLands.[3] Other territories may be incorporated in the Realm by an act\r\nof the Realm, if their populations should so desire in virtue of the\r\nright of self-determination.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 3.\r\n\r\nThe colours of the Realm are black-red-gold.

Other religious associations may\r\nobtain it, on demand, should their constitution and their membership\r\nguarantee their permanent character. Should several such public\r\ncorporate bodies join to form one federation, such federation is\r\nitself a public corporate body.\r\n\r\nReligious associations which are public corporate bodies may tax their\r\nmembers on the basis of the rate assessments and subject to Land\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nAssociations whose aim is to promote the cult of a common view of life\r\nshall be on a par with religious associations.\r\n\r\nThe Land Legislatures shall be responsible for any further regulation\r\nof the application of these principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 138.\r\n\r\nThe Land Legislatures shall discharge any liabilities due to religious\r\nbodies in virtue of a law, contract, or deed.

The consent of the State must\r\nbe given if such private schools are not inferior to the public\r\nschools in respect of their educational aims and arrangements, and in\r\nrespect of the professional standard of their teaching staffs, and if\r\nno distinctions are made between scholar and scholar on account of the\r\nfinancial position of their parents. Consent shall be refused if the\r\nfinancial and legal position of the teaching staff be not sufficiently\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nPrivate elementary schools may only be set up if a minority of parents\r\nor guardians, claiming consideration under Clause 2 of Article 146,\r\nhave no public elementary school for their faith or views, or if the\r\neducational administrative authorities recognise that special\r\neducational interests are involved.\r\n\r\nPrivate preparatory schools are abolished.\r\n\r\nThe legal status of private schools which do not take the place of\r\npublic schools is unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 148.\r\n\r\nAll schools shall aim at inculcating moral character, a civic\r\nconscience, personal and professional efficiency in the spirit of the\r\nGerman national character and of international conciliation.\r\n\r\nThe teacher in public schools shall avoid offence to those of contrary\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nEducation in citizenship and technical instruction are part of the\r\ncurricula.

Adequate compensation shall be paid, unless otherwise\r\nprovided by act of the Realm. Any dispute as to the amount of\r\ncompensation shall be referred to the ordinary courts. Property of the\r\nLands, the local authorities, or public associations can only be\r\nexpropriated by the Realm against compensation. Property imposes\r\nobligations. Its use by the owner must at the same time serve the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 154.\r\n\r\nThe right of inheritance shall be guaranteed in accordance with the\r\nCivil Code. The laws shall determine the proportion of inherited\r\nproperty accruing to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 155.\r\n\r\nDistribution and cultivation of the soil shall be supervised by the\r\nState so as to ensure against abuses and to endeavour to secure\r\nhealthy housing for every German, and suitable homes for each German\r\nfamily, especially those with many children, in which they can live\r\nand work.

It was introduced in\r\norder to convey that new Germany, while retaining the ancient title and\r\ntradition of \"Reich,\" had given it a new significance, and that thereby\r\nno concession was intended either to Monarchists or Imperialists or\r\nMilitarists.\r\n\r\nTherefore \"Reich\" is not to be translated Empire. Commonwealth would\r\nperhaps be the best rendering, but Realm will be used here as more\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n[2] This clause is of crucial importance. Henceforward all sovereignty\r\nis of the German people and not of the princes or principalities. The\r\nGerman Bund of 1815 was a mere confederation between sovereigns or\r\nStaaten Bund. The North German Bund of 1866 was a federation of\r\nsemi-sovereigns, or Bundes Staat. The present German Republic is still a\r\nFederal State, but sovereignty is inherent in the people, not in the\r\nconstituent governments.\r\n\r\n[3] ART. 2.--The transformation of this Constitution from a centralised\r\nrepublic into a confederation and back to a federation has been reviewed\r\nalready. The word \"lander\" is literally translated for this and other\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n[4] ART. 3.--\"Whether these colours black-red-gold, are really the\r\ncolours of the ancient Reich, which historians dispute, or are those of\r\nthe Lutzow Free Company, we look rather to the political ideals and aims\r\nassociated with them during the nineteenth century. It was the idea of\r\npolitical freedom and of national unity that kept the black-red-gold, an\r\nhonoured symbol in German Austria long after the black-white-red had\r\nflown over the German Empire. As the historian Constantine Franz has\r\nsaid, in mediaeval times there was an Austro-Germany, in modern times a\r\nPrusso-Germany, and now there must be a German Germany.\"--Dr. Preuss,\r\nintroductory speech, 24th February, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe clause as it stands is a compromise between the \"Right,\" who wished\r\nto retain the black, white, and red, and the \"Left,\" who wanted the red\r\nflag. A compromise in which the Right have as elsewhere had the best of\r\nit--as the red flag is not allowed.\r\n\r\n[5] ART. 4.--\"German Democracy can only welcome a League of Nations that\r\nhas itself a really democratic constitution and that recognises without\r\nreserve or restriction the liberty and equality of all its members. We\r\nshall have no members of inferior status in our commonwealth, but\r\nneither will we be of inferior status in the League of Nations.\"--Dr.\r\nPreuss, speech introducing the Draft Constitution, February, 1919. The\r\nphases of this clause have been reviewed above, see p. 236.\r\n\r\n[6] ART. 6.--See Art. 78 as to the rights in foreign relations retained\r\nby the Lands.\r\n\r\n[7] See Art. 80.\r\n\r\n[8] This simple attribution of military matters to the Reich replaces\r\nthe complicated recognitions of the \"reserved rights\" of the southern\r\nStates in the early drafts. See p. 257 for the importance of this\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n[9] The first draft gave the Reich exclusive jurisdiction over railways,\r\ncanals, and air traffic, which it now shares with the Lands.--See Art.\r\n7, Sec. 19.\r\n\r\n[10] ART. 7.--This, with Sec. 12, represents a gain to Socialism, as the\r\ntransfer of \"Socialisation\" to the Reich prevents indefinite obstruction\r\nby a Conservative Landtag. See Art. 153.\r\n\r\n[11] See Art. 171.\r\n\r\n[12] ART. 8.--See Art. 85 for rights retained by a Landtag; also p. 254\r\nfor the general effect of this provision.\r\n\r\n[13] ART. 10.--The earlier drafts formulated such principles as an\r\nintegral part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[14] ART. 17.--What a \"free State\" Constitution means was not defined by\r\nthe authors of the Constitution. Its opponents argued that it might\r\nadmit of a monarchist restoration in Prussia, but this has since been\r\nbarred constitutionally by the provision that the Reich is a Republic\r\n(Art. 1).\r\n\r\n[15] The first draft established a single chamber legislation in the\r\nLands.\r\n\r\n[16] This sentence was added apparently to bar the setting up of further\r\nunparliamentary Raete republics in opposition to the Chambers, as in\r\nBavaria, Brunswick, etc.\r\n\r\n[17] This residential qualification was added to meet objections that\r\notherwise Landtag elections might be influenced by an influx of outside\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n[18] ART. 18.--This, the most contentious article in the Constitution,\r\nembodies the concessions made by the centralising purists--its\r\nauthors--to the federalising particularists--its critics. The history of\r\nits phases has been given above, see p. 243. Its form in the first draft\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is open to the German people to establish new Free States within the\r\nRealm, irrespective of the previous frontiers, in so far as the racial\r\ncharacter of the population, economic conditions, and historical\r\ntraditions favour their formation. Such new Free States should have at\r\nleast two million inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"The union of two or more constituent States into a new Free State is\r\neffected by governmental convention between them, subject to the\r\napproval of the Legislatures and the Government of the Realm.\r\n\r\n\"If the population of a district wish to secede from their allegiance\r\nand join one or more German Free States, or form a Free State, a\r\nplebiscite is necessary. The plebiscite will be initiated by the\r\nGovernment of the Land or of one or more autonomous bodies comprising at\r\nleast a quarter of the population concerned. It will be instituted by\r\nthe Government of the Realm and enforced by the local authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe general effect of the Constitution combined with present political\r\nconditions is that there will be no change of any importance in the\r\ncomposition of the countries constituting the Realm. See also Art. 167\r\nsuspending operation of pars. 3 to 6 of this article for two years.\r\n\r\n[19] ART. 20.--In the first draft the Sovereign Reichstag consisted,\r\nnot, as here, of the popular Chamber only, but of the Volkshaus--the\r\npopular Chamber, and the Staatenhaus--the representatives of the States.\r\nThe latter, now known as the Reichsrat (see Art. 60), is no longer part\r\nof the sovereign body and has merely a suspensory veto against it (see\r\nArt. 74).\r\n\r\n[20] ART. 25.--The President's power of dissolution was unrestricted in\r\nthe early drafts.\r\n\r\n[21] ART. 34.--This article, a late addition, constitutionalises a\r\nprocedure that strengthens democracy as against bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n[22] ART. 35.--The institution of a permanent Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs for which our advocates of democratic diplomacy have laboured in\r\nvain for twenty years has been commented on above, see p. 253.\r\n\r\n[23] ART. 48.--It was in virtue of the article corresponding to this in\r\nthe provisional constitution that Berlin attacked and suppressed the\r\nCouncil Governments set up in Munich, Brunswick, Bremen, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[24] Art. 55.--The Chancellor is consequently no longer the sole\r\nresponsible Minister, but merely as elsewhere in democratic\r\nconstitutions _primus inter pares_, the Premier. Moreover, he has, of\r\ncourse, lost his special authority from the Crown and his special\r\nassociation with Prussia. It would have been better in the circumstances\r\nto have dropped the title of Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[25] Art. 60.--The Reichsrat is the much reduced remains of the\r\nBundesrat. (See p. 252 and Arts. 1 and 20.)\r\n\r\n[26] Art. 61.--For the importance of this restriction in respect of\r\nPrussia, see p. 251.\r\n\r\n[27] This clause as to German Austria was objected to by the Supreme\r\nCouncil at Paris as contrary to Art. 80 of the Treaty of Versailles:\r\n\"Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the independence of\r\nAustria.... She agrees that this independence shall be inalienable\r\nexcept with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.\" The\r\nexchange of notes on the subject is not worth appending, as it expresses\r\nan ephemeral phase of diplomacy and not any essential principle of\r\ninternational law. In so far as the German Constitution is concerned,\r\nthe objection seems unimportant in view of Art. 178, par. 2.\r\n\r\n[28] Art. 63.--A compromise between the former Bundesrat, where the\r\ndelegates were plenipotentiaries representing semi-sovereign States, and\r\nthe centralising draft of Preuss, where they were no more than\r\npoliticians chosen on party, not on particularist, grounds.\r\n\r\n[29] Art. 71.--A curious little example of provincial jealousy, which\r\nsubstituted \"capital\" for \"Berlin.\"\r\n\r\n[30] Art. 76.--\"It is an essential of democratic constitutions that they\r\nbe difficult of amendment\" (Preuss). On the other hand, such\r\ndifficulties have their danger, as in 1851, when Louis Napoleon obtained\r\na simple majority but not a two-thirds majority for an amendment; which\r\nled eventually to a _coup d'etat_ and a complete overthrow of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n[31] See Art. 169.\r\n\r\n[32] See Art. 170.\r\n\r\n[33] See Art. 171.\r\n\r\n[34] These principles were formerly mostly provided for in the German\r\nCode; though some, and they the most important, were previously only\r\nguaranteed by State Law.\r\n\r\n[35] See Art. 175.\r\n\r\n[36] Art. 109.--Equality of the sexes and abolition of titles, is of\r\ncourse, an innovation.\r\n\r\n[37] Art. 112.--This has no effect as against demands for extradition\r\nmade under the Treaty of Versailles, in view of Art. 178, Sec. 3.\r\n\r\n[38] Art. 124.--This repeals a provision of the Prussian Constitution\r\nthat religious associations can only be incorporated by special\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n[39] Art. 137.--This article is a much-contested compromise in which the\r\nSocialists have secured in the end a striking success over the Roman\r\nCatholic Centrum and Right. The latter entered the fight with the full\r\nintention of maintaining State Churches everywhere. Probably the\r\nset-back suffered in the South from the Communist capture of Munich\r\nreconciled them to disestablishment without disendowment. That par. 7\r\nwould give \"Bolshevism\" a claim to equal treatment with Protestantism is\r\nnot of immediate importance.\r\n\r\n[40] See Art. 173.\r\n\r\n[41] Art. 146.--The separation of church and school effected in this and\r\npreceding articles was bitterly opposed by the Roman Catholics. Defeated\r\nin this article, they secured a respite in Art. 174 which postpones its\r\napplication until further legislation. See Art. 174.\r\n\r\n[42] This chapter breaks new ground, as might be inferred from the\r\nabstract character of its provisions and constant reference to special\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n[43] Art. 165.--An Act regulating these councils has already been\r\nintroduced (Aug., 1919). For the importance of this article, see above,\r\npp. 69, 172, 184.\r\n\r\n[44] On the strength of this clause the Government have transformed the\r\nNational or Constituent Assembly into a Reichstag, without the election\r\ncertainly contemplated when it was first convoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAdlon-Hotel, demonstrations, 208\r\n\r\nAdvertisements, as documents, 56, 79, 131\r\n\r\nAeroplanes, German, 91\r\n\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, cession, 46, 150, 202, 215, 220, 223\r\n\r\nAnhalt, 250\r\n\r\nArmy, v.
