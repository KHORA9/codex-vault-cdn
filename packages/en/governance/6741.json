My task was then suspended during a long absence from England; and\r\nit was only in the course of the last year that I applied myself\r\nseriously to the completion of it.\r\n\r\nTo my friend, Mr. Charles Sheridan, whose talents and character reflect\r\nhonor upon a name, already so distinguished, I am indebted for the chief\r\npart of the materials upon which the following Memoirs of his father are\r\nfounded. I have to thank him, not only for this mark of confidence, but\r\nfor the delicacy with which, though so deeply interested in the subject\r\nof my task, he has refrained from all interference with the execution of\r\nit:--neither he, nor any other person, beyond the Printing-office,\r\nhaving ever read a single sentence of the work.\r\n\r\nI mention this, in order that the responsibility of any erroneous views\r\nor indiscreet disclosures, with which I shall be thought chargeable in\r\nthe course of these pages, may not be extended to others, but rest\r\nsolely with myself.\r\n\r\nThe details of Mr. Sheridan's early life were obligingly communicated to\r\nme by his younger sister, Mrs. Lefanu, to whom, and to her highly gifted\r\ndaughter, I offer my best thanks for the assistance which they have\r\nafforded me.\r\n\r\nThe obligations, of a similar nature, which I owe to the kindness of Mr.\r\nWilliam Linley, Doctor Bain, Mr. Burgess, and others, are acknowledged,\r\nwith due gratitude, in my remarks on their respective communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS TO VOL.

SHERIDAN.--HIS FIRST ATTEMPTS IN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Brinsley [Footnote: He was christened also by the name of\r\nButler, after the Earl of Lanesborough.] Sheridan was born in the month\r\nof September, 1751, at No. 12, Dorset Street, Dublin, and baptized in\r\nSt. Mary's Church, as appears by the register of the parish, on the\r\nfourth of the following month. His grandfather, Dr. Sheridan, and his\r\nfather, Mr. Thomas Sheridan, have attained a celebrity, independent of\r\nthat which he has conferred on them, by the friendship and\r\ncorrespondence with which the former was honored by Swift, and the\r\ncompetition and even rivalry which the latter so long maintained with\r\nGarrick. His mother, too, was a woman of considerable talents, and\r\naffords one of the few instances that have occurred, of a female\r\nindebted for a husband to her literature; as it was a pamphlet she wrote\r\nconcerning the Dublin theatre that first attracted to her the notice of\r\nMr. Thomas Sheridan. Her affecting novel, Sidney Biddulph, could boast\r\namong its warm panegyrists Mr. Fox and Lord North; and in the Tale of\r\nNourjahad she has employed the graces of Eastern fiction to inculcate a\r\ngrave and important moral,--putting on a fairy disguise, like her own\r\nMandane, to deceive her readers into a taste for happiness and virtue.\r\nBesides her two plays, The Discovery and The Dupe,--the former of which\r\nGarrick pronounced to be \"one of the best comedies he ever read,\"--she\r\nwrote a comedy also, called The Trip to Bath, which was never either\r\nacted or published, but which has been supposed by some of those\r\nsagacious persons, who love to look for flaws in the titles of fame, to\r\nhave passed, with her other papers, into the possession of her son, and,\r\nafter a transforming sleep, like that of the chrysalis, in his hands, to\r\nhave taken wing at length in the brilliant form of The Rivals. The\r\nliterary labors of her husband were less fanciful, but not, perhaps,\r\nless useful, and are chiefly upon subjects connected with education, to\r\nthe study and profession of which he devoted the latter part of his\r\nlife. Such dignity, indeed, did his favorite pursuit assume in his own\r\neyes, that he is represented (on the authority, however, of one who was\r\nhimself a schoolmaster) to have declared, that \"he would rather see his\r\ntwo sons at the head of respectable academies, than one of them prime\r\nminister of England, and the other at the head of affairs in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven years, Richard Brinsley Sheridan was, with his elder\r\nbrother, Charles Francis, placed under the tuition of Mr. Samuel Whyte,\r\nof Grafton Street, Dublin,--an amiable and respectable man, who, for\r\nnear fifty years after, continued at the head of his profession in that\r\nmetropolis. To remember our school-days with gratitude and pleasure, is\r\na tribute at once to the zeal and gentleness of our master, which none\r\never deserved more truly from his pupils than Mr. Whyte, and which the\r\nwriter of these pages, who owes to that excellent person all the\r\ninstructions in English literature he has ever received, is happy to\r\ntake this opportunity of paying. The young Sheridans, however, were\r\nlittle more than a year under his care--and it may be consoling to\r\nparents who are in the first crisis of impatience, at the sort of\r\nhopeless stupidity which some children exhibit, to know, that the dawn\r\nof Sheridan's intellect was as dull and unpromising as its meridian day\r\nwas bright; and that in the year 1759, he who, in less than thirty years\r\nafterwards, held senates enchained by his eloquence and audiences\r\nfascinated by his wit, was, by common consent both of parent and\r\npreceptor, pronounced to be \"a most impenetrable dunce.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Whyte's school the boys were removed to England, where Mr. and\r\nMrs. Sheridan had lately gone to reside, and in the year 1762 Richard\r\nwas sent to Harrow--Charles being kept at home as a fitter subject for\r\nthe instructions of his father, who, by another of those calculations of\r\npoor human foresight, which the deity, called Eventus by the Romans,\r\ntakes such wanton pleasure in falsifying, considered his elder son as\r\ndestined to be the brighter of the two brother stars. At Harrow, Richard\r\nwas remarkable only as a very idle, careless, but, at the same time,\r\nengaging boy, who contrived to win the affection, and even admiration of\r\nthe whole school, both masters and pupils, by the mere charm of his\r\nfrank and genial manners, and by the occasional gleams of superior\r\nintellect, which broke through all the indolence and indifference of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHarrow, at this time, possessed some peculiar advantages, of which a\r\nyouth like Sheridan might have powerfully availed himself. At the head\r\nof the school was Doctor Robert Sumner, a man of fine talents, but,\r\nunfortunately, one of those who have passed away without leaving any\r\ntrace behind, except in the admiring recollection of their\r\ncontemporaries. His taste is said to have been of a purity almost\r\nperfect, combining what are seldom seen together, that critical judgment\r\nwhich is alive to the errors of genius, with the warm sensibility that\r\ndeeply feels its beauties. At the same period, the distinguished\r\nscholar, Dr. Parr, who, to the massy erudition of a former age, joined\r\nall the free and enlightened intelligence of the present, was one of the\r\nunder masters of the school; and both he and Dr. Sumner endeavored, by\r\nevery method they could devise, to awaken in Sheridan a consciousness of\r\nthose powers which, under all the disadvantages of indolence and\r\ncarelessness, it was manifest to them that he possessed. But\r\nremonstrance and encouragement were equally thrown away upon the good-\r\nhumored but immovable indifference of their pupil; and though there\r\nexist among Mr. Sheridan's papers some curious proofs of an industry in\r\nstudy for which few have ever given him credit, they are probably but\r\nthe desultory efforts of a later period of his life, to recover the loss\r\nof that first precious time, whose susceptibility of instruction, as\r\nwell as of pleasure, never comes again.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable acquisitions he derived from Harrow was that\r\nfriendship, which lasted throughout his life, with Dr. Parr,--which\r\nmutual admiration very early began, and the \"_idem sentire de re\r\npublica_\" of course not a little strengthened.\r\n\r\nAs this learned and estimable man has, within the last few weeks, left a\r\nvoid in the world which will not be easily filled up, I feel that it\r\nwould be unjust to my readers not to give, in his own words, the\r\nparticulars of Sheridan's school-days, with which he had the kindness to\r\nfavor me, and to which his name gives an authenticity and interest too\r\nvaluable on such a subject to be withheld:\r\n\r\n\"Hatton, August 3, 1818.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"With the aid of a scribe I sit down to fulfil my promise about Mr.\r\nSheridan. There was little in his boyhood worth communication. He was\r\ninferior to many of his school-fellows in the ordinary business of a\r\nschool, and I do not remember any one instance in which he distinguished\r\nhimself by Latin or English composition, in prose or verse. [Footnote:\r\nIt will be seen, however, though Dr. Parr was not aware of the\r\ncircumstance, that Sheridan did try his talent at English verse before\r\nhe left Harrow.] Nathaniel Halhed, one of his school-fellows, wrote well\r\nin Latin and Greek. Richard Archdall, another school-fellow, excelled in\r\nEnglish verse. Richard Sheridan aspired to no rivalry with either of\r\nthem. He was at the uppermost part of the fifth form, but he never\r\nreached the sixth, and, if I mistake not, he had no opportunity of\r\nattending the most difficult and the most honorable of school business,\r\nwhen the Greek plays were taught--and it was the custom at Harrow to\r\nteach these at least every year. He went through his lessons in Horace,\r\nand Virgil, and Homer well enough for a time. But, in the absence of the\r\nupper master, Doctor Sumner, it once fell in my way to instruct the two\r\nupper forms, and upon calling up Dick Sheridan, I found him not only\r\nslovenly in construing, but unusually defective in his Greek grammar.\r\nKnowing him to be a clever fellow, I did not fail to probe and to tease\r\nhim. I stated his case with great good-humor to the upper master, who\r\nwas one of the best tempered men in the world; and it was agreed between\r\nus, that Richard should be called oftener and worked more severely. The\r\nvarlet was not suffered to stand up in his place; but was summoned to\r\ntake his station near the master's table, where the voice of no prompter\r\ncould reach him; and, in this defenceless condition, he was so harassed,\r\nthat he at last gathered up some grammatical rules, and prepared himself\r\nfor his lessons. While this tormenting process was inflicted upon him, I\r\nnow and then upbraided him. But you will take notice that he did not\r\nincur any corporal punishment for his idleness: his industry was just\r\nsufficient to protect him from disgrace. All the while Sumner and I saw\r\nin him vestiges of a superior intellect. His eye, his countenance, his\r\ngeneral manner, were striking. His answers to any common question were\r\nprompt and acute. We knew the esteem, and even admiration, which,\r\nsomehow or other, all his school-fellows felt for him. He was\r\nmischievous enough, but his pranks were accompanied by a sort of\r\nvivacity and cheerfulness, which delighted Sumner and myself. I had much\r\ntalk with him about his apple-loft, for the supply of which all the\r\ngardens in the neighborhood were taxed, and some of the lower boys were\r\nemployed to furnish it. I threatened, but without asperity, to trace the\r\ndepredators, through his associates, up to their leader. He with perfect\r\ngood-humor set me at defiance, and I never could bring the charge home\r\nto him. All boys and all masters were pleased with him. I often praised\r\nhim as a lad of great talents,--often exhorted him to use them well;\r\nbut my exhortations were fruitless. I take for granted that his taste\r\nwas silently improved, and that he knew well the little which he did\r\nknow. He was removed from school too soon by his father, who was the\r\nintimate friend of Sumner, and whom I often met at his house. Sumner had\r\na fine voice, fine ear, fine taste, and, therefore, pronunciation was\r\nfrequently the favorite subject between him and Tom Sheridan. I was\r\npresent at many of their discussions and disputes, and sometimes took a\r\nvery active part in them,--but Richard was not present. The father, you\r\nknow, was a wrong-headed, whimsical man, and, perhaps, his scanty\r\ncircumstances were one of the reasons which prevented him from sending\r\nRichard to the University. He must have been aware, as Sumner and I\r\nwere, that Richard's mind was not cast in any ordinary mould. I ought to\r\nhave told you that Richard, when a boy, was a great reader of English\r\npoetry; but his exercises afforded no proof of his proficiency. In\r\ntruth, he, as a boy, was quite careless about literary fame. I should\r\nsuppose that his father, without any regular system, polished his taste,\r\nand supplied his memory with anecdotes about our best writers in our\r\nAugustan age. The grandfather, you know, lived familiarly with Swift. I\r\nhave heard of him, as an excellent scholar. His boys in Ireland once\r\nperformed a Greek play, and when Sir William Jones and I were talking\r\nover this event, I determined to make the experiment in England. I\r\nselected some of my best boys, and they performed the Oedipus Tyrannus,\r\nand the Trachinians of Sophocles. I wrote some Greek Iambics to\r\nvindicate myself from the imputation of singularity, and grieved I am\r\nthat I did not keep a copy of them. Milton, you may remember, recommends\r\nwhat I attempted.\r\n\r\n\"I saw much of Sheridan's father after the death of Sumner, and after my\r\nown removal from Harrow to Stanmer. I respected him,--he really liked\r\nme, and did me some important services,--but I never met him and Richard\r\ntogether. I often inquired about Richard, and, from the father's\r\nanswers, found they were not upon good terms,--but neither he nor I ever\r\nspoke of his son's talents but in terms of the highest praise.\" In a\r\nsubsequent letter Dr. Parr says: \"I referred you to a passage in the\r\nGentleman's Magazine, where I am represented as discovering and\r\nencouraging in Richard Sheridan those intellectual powers which had not\r\nbeen discovered and encouraged by Sumner. But the statement is\r\nincorrect. We both of us discovered talents, which neither of us could\r\nbring into action while Sheridan was a school-boy. He gave us few\r\nopportunities of praise in the course of his school business, and yet he\r\nwas well aware that we thought highly of him, and anxiously wished more\r\nto be done by him than he was disposed to do.\r\n\r\n\"I once or twice met his mother,--she was quite celestial. Both her\r\nvirtues and her genius were highly esteemed by Robert Sumner. I know not\r\nwhether Tom Sheridan found Richard tractable in the art of speaking,--\r\nand, upon such a subject, indolence or indifference would have been\r\nresented by the father as crimes quite inexpiable. One of Richard's\r\nsisters now and then visited Harrow, and well do I remember that, in the\r\nhouse where I lodged, she triumphantly repeated Dryden's Ode upon St.\r\nCecilia's Day, according to the instruction given to her by her father.\r\nTake a sample:\r\n\r\n  _None_ but the brave,\r\n  None but the _brave_,\r\n  None _but_ the brave deserve the fair.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the zeal or the proficiency of the sister,\r\nnaughty Richard, like Gallio, seemed to care naught for these things.\r\n\r\n\"In the later periods of his life Richard did not cast behind him\r\nclassical reading. He spoke copiously and powerfully about Cicero. He\r\nhad read, and he had understood, the four orations of Demosthenes, read\r\nand taught in our public schools. He was at home in Virgil and in\r\nHorace. I cannot speak positively about Homer,--but I am very sure that\r\nhe read the Iliad now and then; not as a professed scholar would do,\r\ncritically, but with all the strong sympathies of a poet reading a poet.\r\n[Footnote: It was not one of the least of the triumphs of Sheridan's\r\ntalent to have been able to persuade so acute a scholar as Dr. Parr,\r\nthat the extent of his classical acquirements was so great as is here\r\nrepresented, and to have thus impressed with the idea of his remembering\r\nso much, the person who best knew how little he had learned.] Richard\r\ndid not, and could not forget what he once knew, but his path to\r\nknowledge was his own,--his steps were noiseless,--his progress was\r\nscarcely felt by himself,--his movements were rapid but irregular.\r\n\r\n\"Let me assure you that Richard, when a boy, was by no means vicious.\r\nThe sources of his infirmities were a scanty and precarious allowance\r\nfrom the father, the want of a regular plan for some profession, and,\r\nabove all, the act of throwing him upon the town, when he ought to have\r\nbeen pursuing his studies at the University. He would have done little\r\namong mathematicians at Cambridge;--he would have been a rake, or an\r\nidler, or a trifler, at Dublin;--but I am inclined to think that at\r\nOxford he would have become an excellent scholar.\r\n\r\n\"I have now told you all that I know, and it amounts to very little. I\r\nam very solicitous for justice to be done to Robert Sumner. He is one of\r\nthe six or seven persons among my own acquaintance whose taste I am\r\naccustomed to consider perfect, and, were he living, his admiration....\"\r\n[Footnote: The remainder of the letter relates to other subjects.]\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of Richard's stay at Harrow his father had been\r\ncompelled, by the embarrassment of his affairs, to reside with the\r\nremainder of the family in France, and it was at Blois, in the September\r\nof 1766, that Mrs. Sheridan died--leaving behind her that best kind of\r\nfame, which results from a life of usefulness and purity, and which it\r\nrequires not the aid of art or eloquence to blazon. She appears to have\r\nbeen one of those rare women, who, united to men of more pretensions,\r\nbut less real intellect than themselves, meekly conceal this superiority\r\neven from their own hearts, and pass their lives without remonstrance or\r\nmurmur, in gently endeavoring to repair those evils which the\r\nindiscretion or vanity of their partners has brought upon them.\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to the interesting communication of Dr. Parr, I shall\r\nhere subjoin an extract from a letter which the eldest sister of\r\nSheridan, Mrs. E. Lefanu, wrote a few months after his death to Mrs.\r\nSheridan, in consequence of a wish expressed by the latter that Mrs.\r\nLefanu would communicate such particulars as she remembered of his early\r\ndays. It will show, too, the feeling which his natural good qualities,\r\nin spite of the errors by which they were obscured and weakened, kept\r\nalive to the last, in the hearts of those connected with him, that sort\r\nof retrospective affection, which, when those whom we have loved become\r\naltered, whether in mind or person, brings the recollection of what they\r\nonce were, to mingle with and soften our impression of what they are.\r\n\r\nAfter giving an account of the residence of the family in France, she\r\ncontinues: \"We returned to England, when I may say I first became\r\nacquainted with my brother--for faint and imperfect were my\r\nrecollections of him, as might be expected from my age. I saw him; and\r\nmy childish attachment revived with double force. He was handsome, not\r\nmerely in the eyes of a partial sister, but generally allowed to be so.\r\nHis cheeks had the glow of health; his eyes,--the finest in the world,--\r\nthe brilliancy of genius, and were soft as a tender and affectionate\r\nheart could render them. The same playful fancy, the same sterling and\r\ninnoxious wit, that was shown afterwards in his writings, cheered and\r\ndelighted the family circle. I admired--I almost adored him. I would\r\nmost willingly have sacrificed my life for him, as I, in some measure,\r\nproved to him at Bath, where we resided for some time, and where events\r\nthat you must have heard of engaged him in a duel. My father's\r\ndispleasure threatened to involve me in the denunciations against him,\r\nfor committing what he considered as a crime. Yet I risked everything,\r\nand in the event was made happy by obtaining forgiveness for my\r\nbrother.... You may perceive, dear sister, that very little indeed have\r\nI to say on a subject so near your heart, and near mine also. That for\r\nyears I lost sight of a brother whom I loved with unabated affection--a\r\nlove that neither absence nor neglect could chill--I always consider as\r\na great misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nOn his leaving Harrow, where he continued till near his eighteenth year,\r\nhe was brought home by his father, who, with the elder son, Charles, had\r\nlately returned from France, and taken a house in London. Here the two\r\nbrothers for some time received private tuition from Mr. Lewis Kerr, an\r\nIrish gentleman, who had formerly practised as a physician, but having,\r\nby loss of health, been obliged to give up his profession, supported\r\nhimself by giving lessons in Latin and Mathematics. They attended also\r\nthe fencing and riding schools of Mr. Angelo, and received instructions\r\nfrom their father in English grammar and oratory. Of this advantage,\r\nhowever, it is probable, only the elder son availed himself, as Richard,\r\nwho seems to have been determined to owe all his excellence to nature\r\nalone, was found as impracticable a pupil at home as at school. But,\r\nhowever inattentive to his studies he may have been at Harrow, it\r\nappears, from one of the letters of his school-fellow, Mr. Halhed, that\r\nin poetry, which is usually the first exercise in which these young\r\nathletae of intellect try their strength, he had already distinguished\r\nhimself; and, in conjunction with his friend Halhed, had translated the\r\nseventh Idyl, and many of the lesser poems of Theocritus. This literary\r\npartnership was resumed soon after their departure from Harrow. In the\r\nyear 1770, when Halhed was at Oxford, and Sheridan residing with his\r\nfather at Bath, they entered into a correspondence, (of which,\r\nunluckily, only Halhed's share remains,) and, with all the hope and\r\nspirit of young adventurers, began and prosecuted a variety of works\r\ntogether, of which none but their translation of Aristaenetus ever saw\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nThere is something in the alliance between these boys peculiarly\r\ninteresting. Their united ages, as Halhed boasts in one of his letters,\r\ndid not amount to thirty-eight. They were both abounding in wit and\r\nspirits, and as sanguine as the consciousness of talent and youth could\r\nmake them; both inspired with a taste for pleasure, and thrown upon\r\ntheir own resources for the means of gratifying it; both carelessly\r\nembarking, without rivalry or reserve, their venture of fame in the same\r\nbottom, and both, as Halhed discovered at last, passionately in love\r\nwith the same woman.\r\n\r\nIt would have given me great pleasure to have been enabled to enliven my\r\npages with even a few extracts from that portion of their\r\ncorrespondence, which, as I have just mentioned, has fallen into my\r\nhands. There is in the letters of Mr. Halhed a fresh youthfulness of\r\nstyle, and an unaffected vivacity of thought, which I question whether\r\neven his witty correspondent could have surpassed. As I do not, however,\r\nfeel authorized to lay these letters before the world, I must only avail\r\nmyself of the aid which their contents supply towards tracing the\r\nprogress of his literary partnership with Sheridan, and throwing light\r\non a period so full of interest in the life of the latter.\r\n\r\nTheir first joint production was a farce, or rather play, in three acts,\r\ncalled \"Jupiter,\" written in imitation of the burletta of Midas, whose\r\npopularity seems to have tempted into its wake a number of these musical\r\nparodies upon heathen fable. The amour of Jupiter with _Major_\r\nAmphitryon's wife, and _Sir Richard_ Ixion's courtship of Juno, who\r\nsubstitutes _Miss Peggy Nubilis_ in her place, form the subject of\r\nthis ludicrous little drama, of which Halhed furnished the burlesque\r\nscenes,--while the form of a rehearsal, into which the whole is thrown,\r\nand which, as an anticipation of \"The Critic\" is highly curious, was\r\nsuggested and managed entirely by Sheridan. The following extracts will\r\ngive some idea of the humor of this trifle; and in the character of\r\nSimile the reader will at once discover a sort of dim and shadowy pre-\r\nexistence of Puff:--\r\n\r\n\"_Simile._ Sir, you are very ignorant on the subject,--it is the\r\nmethod most in vogue.\r\n\r\n\"_O'Cul._ What! to make the music first, and then make the sense to\r\nit afterwards!\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ Just so.\r\n\r\n\"_Monop._ What Mr. Simile says is very true, gentlemen; and there\r\nis nothing surprising in it, if we consider now the general method of\r\nwriting _plays to scenes._\r\n\r\n\"_O'Cul._ Writing _plays to scenes_!--Oh, you are joking.\r\n\r\n\"_Monop._ Not I, upon my word. Mr. Simile knows that I have\r\nfrequently a complete set of scenes from Italy, and then I have nothing\r\nto do but to get some ingenious hand to write a play to them.\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ I am your witness, Sir. Gentlemen, you perceive you know\r\nnothing about these matters.\r\n\r\n\"_O'Cul._ Why, Mr. Simile, I don't pretend to know much relating to\r\nthese affairs, but what I think is this, that in this method, according\r\nto your principles, you must often commit blunders.\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ Blunders! to be sure I must, but I always could get myself\r\nout of them again. Why, I'll tell you an instance of it.--You must know\r\nI was once a journeyman sonnet-writer to Signor Squallini. Now, his\r\nmethod, when seized with the _furor harmonicus_, was constantly to\r\nmake me sit by his side, while he was thrumming on his harpsichord, in\r\norder to make extempore verses to whatever air he should beat out to his\r\nliking. I remember, one morning, as he was in this situation, _thrum,\r\nthrum, thrum, (moving his fingers as if beating on the harpsichord,)_\r\nstriking out something prodigiously great, as he thought,--'Hah!' said\r\nhe,--'hah! Mr. Simile, _thrum, thrum, thrum,_ by gar here is vary\r\nfine,--_thrum, thrum, thrum_, write me some words directly.'--I\r\ndurst not interrupt him to ask on what subject, so instantly began to\r\ndescribe a fine morning.\r\n\r\n  \"'Calm was the land and calm the seas,\r\n      And calm the heaven's dome serene,\r\n    Hush'd was the gale and hush'd the breeze,\r\n      And not a vapor to be seen.'\r\n\r\nI sang it to his notes,--'Hah! upon my vord vary pritt,--_thrum,\r\nthrum, thrum,_--stay, stay,--_thrum, thrum,_--Hoa? upon my vord,\r\nhere it must be an adagio,--_thrum, thrum,_--oh! let it be an\r\n_Ode to Melancholy.'_\r\n\r\n\"_Monop._ The Devil!--there you were puzzled sure.\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ Not in the least,--I brought in a _cloud_ in the next\r\nstanza, and matters, you see, came about at once.\r\n\r\n\"_Monop._ An excellent transition.\r\n\r\n\" _O'Cul._ Vastly ingenious indeed.\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ Was it not? hey! it required a little command,--a little\r\npresence of mind,--but I believe we had better proceed.\r\n\r\n\"_Monop._ The sooner the better,--come, gentlemen, resume your\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n\"_Sim._ Now for it.

Though it was in August, 1770, that he received the\r\nsketch of this piece from his friend, and though they both looked\r\nforward most sanguinely to its success, as likely to realize many a\r\ndream of fame and profit, it was not till the month of May in the\r\nsubsequent year, as appears by a letter from Mr. Ker to Sheridan, that\r\nthe probability of the arrival of the manuscript was announced to Mr.\r\nFoote. \"I have dispatched a card, as from H. H., at Owen's Coffee-house,\r\nto Mr. Foote, to inform him that he may expect to see your dramatic\r\npiece about the 25th instant.\"\r\n\r\nTheir hopes and fears in this theatrical speculation are very naturally\r\nand livelily expressed throughout Halhed's letters, sometimes with a\r\ndegree of humorous pathos, which is interesting as characteristic of\r\nboth the writers:--\"the thoughts,\" he says, \"of 200_l_. shared\r\nbetween us are enough to bring the tears into one's eyes.\" Sometimes, he\r\nsets more moderate limits to their ambition, and hopes that they will,\r\nat least, get the freedom of the play-house by it. But at all times he\r\nchides, with good-humored impatience, the tardiness of his fellow-\r\nlaborer in applying to the managers. Fears are expressed that Foote may\r\nhave made other engagements,--and that a piece, called \"Dido,\" on the\r\nsame mythological plan, which had lately been produced with but little\r\nsuccess, might prove an obstacle to the reception of theirs. At Drury\r\nLane, too, they had little hopes of a favorable hearing, as Dibdin was\r\none of the principal butts of their ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe summer season, however, was suffered to pass away without an effort;\r\nand in October, 1771, we find Mr. Halhed flattering himself with hopes\r\nfrom a negotiation with Mr. Garrick. It does not appear, however, that\r\nSheridan ever actually presented this piece to any of the managers; and\r\nindeed it is probable, from the following fragment of a scene found\r\namong his papers, that he soon abandoned the groundwork of Halhed\r\naltogether, and transferred his plan of a rehearsal to some other\r\nsubject, of his own invention, and, therefore, more worthy of his wit.\r\nIt will be perceived that the puffing author was here intended to be a\r\nScotchman.\r\n\r\n\"_M._ Sir, I have read your comedy, and I think it has infinite\r\nmerit, but, pray, don't you think it rather grave?\r\n\r\n\"_S._ Sir, you say true; it _is_ a grave comedy. I follow the\r\nopinion of Longinus, who says comedy ought always to be sentimental.\r\nSir, I value a sentiment of six lines in my piece no more than a nabob\r\ndoes a rupee. I hate those dirty, paltry equivocations, which go by the\r\nname of puns, and pieces of wit. No, Sir, it ever was my opinion that\r\nthe stage should be a place of rational entertainment; instead of which,\r\nI am very sorry to say, most people go there for their diversion:\r\naccordingly, I have formed my comedy so that it is no laughing, giggling\r\npiece of work. He must be a very light man that shall discompose his\r\nmuscles from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\n\"_M._ But don't you think it may be too grave?\r\n\r\n\"_S._ O never fear; and as for hissing, mon, they might as well\r\nhiss the common prayer-book; for there is the viciousness of vice and\r\nthe virtuousness of virtue in every third line.\r\n\r\n\"_M._ I confess there is a great deal of moral in it; but, Sir, I\r\nshould imagine if you tried your hand at tragedy--\r\n\r\n\"_S._ No, mon, there you are out, and I'll relate to you what put\r\nme first on writing a comedy. You must know I had composed a very fine\r\ntragedy about the valiant Bruce. I showed it my Laird of Mackintosh, and\r\nhe was a very candid mon, and he said my genius did not lie in tragedy:\r\nI took the hint, and, as soon as I got home, began my comedy.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here some of the very thoughts and words that afterwards\r\ncontributed to the fortune of Puff; and it is amusing to observe how\r\nlong this subject was played with by the current of Sheridan's fancy,\r\ntill at last, like \"a stone of lustre from the brook,\" it came forth\r\nwith all that smoothness and polish which it wears in his inimitable\r\nfarce, The Critic. Thus it is, too, and but little to the glory of what\r\nare called our years of discretion, that the life of the _man_ is\r\nchiefly employed in giving effect to the wishes and plans of the\r\n_boy_.\r\n\r\nAnother of their projects was a Periodical Miscellany, the idea of which\r\noriginated with Sheridan, and whose first embryo movements we trace in a\r\nletter to him from Mr. Lewis Kerr, who undertook, with much good nature,\r\nthe negotiation of the young author's literary concerns in London. The\r\nletter is dated 30th of October, 1770: \"As to your intended periodical\r\npaper, if it meets with success, there is no doubt of profit accruing,\r\nas I have already engaged a publisher, of established reputation, to\r\nundertake it for the account of the authors. But I am to indemnify him\r\nin case it should not sell, and to advance part of the first expense,\r\nall which I can do without applying to Mr. Ewart.\"--\"I would be glad to\r\nknow what stock of papers you have already written, as there ought to be\r\nten or a dozen at least finished before you print any, in order to have\r\ntime to prepare the subsequent numbers, and ensure a continuance of the\r\nwork. As to the coffee-houses, you must not depend on their taking it in\r\nat first, except you go on the plan of the Tatler, and give the news of\r\nthe week. For the first two or three weeks the expense of advertising\r\nwill certainly prevent any profit being made. But when that is over, if\r\na thousand are sold weekly, you may reckon on receiving L5 clear. One\r\npaper a week will do better than two. Pray say no more as to our\r\naccounts.\"\r\n\r\nThe title intended by Sheridan for this paper was \"Hernan's Miscellany,\"\r\nto which his friend Halhed objected, and suggested, \"The Reformer,\" as a\r\nnewer and more significant name. But though Halhed appears to have\r\nsought among his Oxford friends for an auxiliary or two in their weekly\r\nlabors, this meditated Miscellany never proceeded beyond the first\r\nnumber, which was written by Sheridan, and which I have found among his\r\npapers. It is too diffuse and pointless to be given entire; but an\r\nextract or two from it will not be unwelcome to those who love to trace\r\neven the first, feeblest beginnings of genius:\r\n\r\nHERNAN'S MISCELLANY.\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\n\"'I will sit down and write for the good of the people--for (said I to\r\nmyself, pulling off my spectacles, and drinking up the remainder of my\r\nsixpen'worth) it cannot be but people must be sick of these same\r\nrascally politics. All last winter nothing but--God defend me! 'tis\r\ntiresome to think of it.' I immediately flung the pamphlet down on the\r\ntable, and taking my hat and cane walked out of the coffee-house.\r\n\r\n\"I kept up as smart a pace as I could all the way home, for I felt\r\nmyself full of something, and enjoyed my own thoughts so much, that I\r\nwas afraid of digesting them, lest any should escape me. At last I\r\nknocked at my own door.--'So!' said I to the maid who opened it, (for I\r\nnever would keep a man; not, but what I could afford it--however, the\r\nreason is not material now,) 'So!' said I with an unusual smile upon my\r\nface, and immediately sent her for a quire of paper and half a hundred\r\nof pens--the only thing I had absolutely determined on in my way from\r\nthe coffee-house. I had now got seated in my arm chair,--I am an infirm\r\nold man, and I live on a second floor,--when I began to ruminate on my\r\nproject. The first thing that occurred to me (and certainly a very\r\nnatural one) was to examine my common-place book. So I went to my desk\r\nand took out my old faithful red-leather companion, who had long\r\ndischarged the office of treasurer to all my best hints and memorandums:\r\nbut, how was I surprised, when one of the first things that struck my\r\neyes was the following memorandum, legibly written, and on one of my\r\nbest sheets of vellum:--'Mem.--_Oct. 20th, 1769, left the Grecian\r\nafter having read ----'s Poems, with a determined resolution to write a\r\nPeriodical Paper, in order to reform the vitiated taste of the age; but,\r\ncoming home and finding my fire out, and my maid gone abroad, was\r\nobliged to defer the execution of my plan to another opportunity._'\r\nNow though this event had absolutely slipped my memory, I now\r\nrecollected it perfectly,--ay, so my fire _was_ out indeed, and my\r\nmaid _did_ go abroad sure enough.--'Good Heavens!' said I, 'how\r\ngreat events depend upon little circumstances!' However, I looked upon\r\nthis as a memento for me no longer to trifle away my time and\r\nresolution; and thus I began to reason,--I mean, I _would_ have\r\nreasoned, had I not been interrupted by a noise of some one coming up\r\nstairs. By the alternate thump upon the steps, I soon discovered it must\r\nbe my old and intimate friend Rudliche.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But, to return, in walked Rudliche.--'So, Fred.'--'So, Bob.'--'Were you\r\nat the Grecian to-day?'--'I just stepped in.'--'Well, any news?'--'No,\r\nno, there was no news.' Now, as Bob and I saw one another almost every\r\nday, we seldom abounded in conversation; so, having settled one material\r\npoint, he sat in his usual posture, looking at the fire and beating the\r\ndust out of his wooden leg, when I perceived he was going to touch upon\r\n_the_ other subject; but, having by chance cast his eye on my face,\r\nand finding (I suppose) something extraordinary in my countenance, he\r\nimmediately dropped all concern for the weather, and putting his hand\r\ninto his pocket, (as if he meant to find what he was going to say, under\r\npretence of feeling for his tobacco-box,) 'Hernan! (he began) why, man,\r\nyou look for all the world as if you had been thinking of something.'--\r\n'Yes,' replied I, smiling, (that is, not actually smiling, but with a\r\nconscious something in my face,) 'I have, indeed, been thinking a\r\nlittle.'--'What, is't a secret?'--'Oh, nothing very material.' Here\r\nensued a pause, which I employed in considering whether I should reveal\r\nmy scheme to Bob; and Bob in trying to disengage his thumb from the\r\nstring of his cane, as if he were preparing to take his leave. This\r\nlatter action, with the great desire I had of disburdening myself, made\r\nme instantly resolve to lay my whole plan before him. 'Bob,' said I, (he\r\nimmediately quitted his thumb,) 'you remarked that I looked as if I had\r\nbeen thinking of something,--your remark is just, and I'll tell you the\r\nsubject of my thought. You know, Bob, that I always had a strong passion\r\nfor literature:--you have often seen my collection of books, not very\r\nlarge indeed, however I believe I have read every volume of it twice\r\nover, (excepting ----'_s Divine Legation of Moses_, and ----'_s\r\nLives of the most notorious Malefactors_,) and I am now determined to\r\nprofit by them.' I concluded with a very significant nod; but, good\r\nheavens! how mortified was I to find both my speech and my nod thrown\r\naway, when Rudliche calmly replied, with the true phlegm of ignorance,\r\n'My dear friend, I think your resolution in regard to your books a very\r\nprudent one; but I do not perfectly conceive your plan as to the\r\n_profit_; for, though your volumes may be very curious, yet you\r\nknow they are most of them secondhand.'--I was so vexed with the\r\nfellow's stupidity that I had a great mind to punish him by not\r\ndisclosing a syllable more. However, at last my vanity got the better of\r\nmy resentment, and I explained to him the whole matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In examining the beginning of the Spectators, &c., I find they are all\r\nwritten by a society.--Now I profess to write all myself, though I\r\nacknowledge that, on account of a weakness in my eyes, I have got some\r\nunderstrappers who are to write the poetry, &c.... In order to find the\r\ndifferent merits of these my subalterns, I stipulated with them that\r\nthey should let me feed them as I would. This they consented to do, and\r\nit is surprising to think what different effects diet has on the\r\nwriters. The same, who after having been fed two days upon artichokes\r\nproduced as pretty a copy of verses as ever I saw, on beef was as dull\r\nas ditch-water....\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a characteristic of fools,\" says some one, \"to be always\r\nbeginning,\"--and this is not the only point in which folly and genius\r\nresemble each other. So chillingly indeed do the difficulties of\r\nexecution succeed to the first ardor of conception, that it is only\r\nwonderful there should exist so many finished monuments of genius, or\r\nthat men of fancy should not oftener have contented themselves with\r\nthose first vague sketches, in the production of which the chief luxury\r\nof intellectual creation lies. Among the many literary works shadowed\r\nout by Sheridan at this time were a Collection of Occasional Poems, and\r\na volume of Crazy Tales, to the former of which Halhed suggests that\r\n\"the old things they did at Harrow out of Theocritus\" might, with a\r\nlittle pruning, form a useful contribution. The loss of the volume of\r\nCrazy Tales is little to be regretted, as from its title we may conclude\r\nit was written in imitation of the clever but licentious productions of\r\nJohn Hall Stephenson. If the same kind oblivion had closed over the\r\nlevities of other young authors, who, in the season of folly and the\r\npassions, have made their pages the transcript of their lives, it would\r\nhave been equally fortunate for themselves and the world.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been the industry of these youthful authors, the\r\ntranslation of Aristaenetus, as I have already stated, was the only\r\nfruit of their literary alliance that ever arrived at sufficient\r\nmaturity for publication. In November, 1770, Halhed had completed and\r\nforwarded to Bath his share of the work, and in the following month we\r\nfind Sheridan preparing, with the assistance of a Greek grammar, to\r\ncomplete the task. \"The 29th ult., (says Mr. Ker, in a letter to him\r\nfrom London, dated Dec. 4, 1770,) I was favored with yours, and have\r\nsince been hunting for Aristaenetus, whom I found this day, and\r\ntherefore send to you, together with a Greek grammar. I might have\r\ndispatched at the same time some numbers of the Dictionary, but not\r\nhaving got the last two numbers, was not willing to send any without the\r\nwhole of what is published, and still less willing to delay\r\nAristaenetus's journey by waiting for them.\" The work alluded to here is\r\nthe Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, to which Sheridan had subscribed,\r\nwith the view, no doubt, of informing himself upon subjects of which he\r\nwas as yet wholly ignorant, having left school, like most other young\r\nmen at his age, as little furnished with the knowledge that is wanted in\r\nthe world, as a person would be for the demands of a market, who went\r\ninto it with nothing but a few ancient coins in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe passion, however, that now began to take possession of his heart was\r\nlittle favorable to his advancement in any serious studies, and it may\r\neasily be imagined that, in the neighborhood of Miss Linley, the Arts\r\nand Sciences were suffered to sleep quietly on their shelves. Even the\r\ntranslation of Aristaenetus, though a task more suited, from its amatory\r\nnature, to the existing temperature of his heart, was proceeded in but\r\nslowly; and it appears from one of Halhed's letters, that this impatient\r\nally was already counting upon the _spolia opima_ of the campaign,\r\nbefore Sheridan had fairly brought his Greek grammar into the field. The\r\ngreat object of the former was a visit to Bath, and he had set his heart\r\nstill more anxiously upon it, after a second meeting with Miss Linley at\r\nOxford. But the profits expected from their literary undertakings were\r\nthe only means to which he looked for the realizing of this dream; and\r\nhe accordingly implores his friend, with the most comic piteousness, to\r\ndrive the farce on the stage by main force, and to make Aristaenetus\r\nsell whether he will or not. In the November of this year we find them\r\ndiscussing the propriety of prefixing their names to the work--Sheridan\r\nevidently not disinclined to venture, but Halhed recommending that they\r\nshould wait to hear how \"Sumner and the wise few of their acquaintance\"\r\nwould talk of the book, before they risked anything more than their\r\ninitials. In answer to Sheridan's inquiries as to the extent of sale\r\nthey may expect in Oxford, he confesses that, after three coffee-houses\r\nhad bought one a-piece, not two more would be sold.\r\n\r\nThat poverty is the best nurse of talent has long been a most\r\nhumiliating truism; and the fountain of the Muses, bursting from a\r\nbarren rock, is but too apt an emblem of the hard source from which much\r\nof the genius of this world has issued. How strongly the young\r\ntranslators of Aristaenetus were under the influence of this sort of\r\ninspiration appears from every paragraph of Halhed's letters, and might\r\neasily, indeed, be concluded of Sheridan, from the very limited\r\ncircumstances of his father, who had nothing besides the pension of L200\r\na year, conferred upon him in consideration of his literary merits, and\r\nthe little profits he derived from his lectures in Bath, to support with\r\ndecency himself and his family. The prospects of Halhed were much more\r\ngolden, but he was far too gay and mercurial to be prudent; and from the\r\nvery scanty supplies which his father allowed him, had quite as little\r\nof \"le superflu, chose si necessaire,\" as his friend. But whatever were\r\nhis other desires and pursuits, a visit to Bath,--to that place which\r\ncontained the two persons he most valued in friendship and in love,--was\r\nthe grand object of all his financial speculations; and among other ways\r\nand means that, in the delay of the expected resources from\r\nAristaenetus, presented themselves, was an exhibition of L20 a year,\r\nwhich the college had lately given him, and with five pounds of which he\r\nthought he might venture \"adire Corinthum.\"\r\n\r\nThough Sheridan had informed his friend that the translation was put to\r\npress some time in March, 1771, it does not appear to have been given\r\ninto the hands of Wilkie, the publisher, till the beginning of May, when\r\nMr. Ker writes thus to Bath: \"Your Aristaenetus is in the hands of Mr.\r\nWilkie, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and to put you out of suspense at\r\nonce, will certainly make his appearance about the first of June next,\r\nin the form of a neat volume, price 3s or 3s 6d, as may best suit his\r\nsize, &c., which cannot be more nearly determined at present, I have\r\nundertaken the task of correcting for the press.... Some of the Epistles\r\nthat I have perused seem to me elegant and poetical; in others I could\r\nnot observe equal beauty, and here and there I could wish there was some\r\nlittle amendment. You will pardon this liberty I take, and set it down\r\nto the account of old-fashioned friendship.\" Mr. Ker, to judge from his\r\nletters, (which, in addition to their other laudable points, are dated\r\nwith a precision truly exemplary,) was a very kind, useful, and sensible\r\nperson, and in the sober hue of his intellect exhibited a striking\r\ncontrast to the sparkling vivacity of the two sanguine and impatient\r\nyoung wits, whose affairs he so good naturedly undertook to negotiate.\r\n\r\nAt length in August, 1771, Aristaenetus made its appearance--contrary\r\nto the advice of the bookseller, and of Mr. Ker, who represented to\r\nSheridan the unpropitiousness of the season, particularly for a first\r\nexperiment in authorship, and advised the postponement of the\r\npublication till October. But the translators were too eager for the\r\nrich harvest of emolument they had promised themselves, and too full of\r\nthat pleasing but often fatal delusion--that calenture, under the\r\ninfluence of which young voyagers to the shores of Fame imagine they\r\nalready see her green fields and groves in the treacherous waves around\r\nthem--to listen to the suggestions of mere calculating men of business.\r\nThe first account they heard of the reception of the work was flattering\r\nenough to prolong awhile this dream of vanity. \"It begins (writes Mr.\r\nKer, in about a fortnight after the publication,) to make some noise,\r\nand is fathered on Mr. Johnson, author of the English Dictionary, &c.\r\nSee to-day's Gazetteer. The critics are admirable in discovering a\r\nconcealed author by his style, manner, &c.\"\r\n\r\nTheir disappointment at the ultimate failure of the book was\r\nproportioned, we may suppose, to the sanguineness of their first\r\nexpectations. But the reluctance with which an author yields to the sad\r\ncertainty of being unread, is apparent in the eagerness with which\r\nHalhed avails himself of every encouragement for a rally of his hopes.\r\nThe Critical Reviewers, it seems, had given the work a tolerable\r\ncharacter, and quoted the first Epistle. [Footnote: In one of the\r\nReviews I have seen it thus spoken of:--\"No such writer as Aristaenetus\r\never existed in the classic era; nor did even the unhappy schools, after\r\nthe destruction of the Eastern empire, produce such a writer. It was\r\nleft to the latter times of monkish imposition to give such trash as\r\nthis, on which the translator has ill spent his time. We have been as\r\nidly employed in reading it, and our readers will in proportion lose\r\ntheir time in perusing this article.\"] The Weekly Review in the Public\r\nLedger had also spoken well of it, and cited a specimen. The Oxford\r\nMagazine had transcribed two whole Epistles, without mentioning from\r\nwhence they were taken. Every body, he says, seemed to have read the\r\nbook, and one of those _hawking booksellers_ who attend the\r\ncoffeehouses assured him it was written by Dr. Armstrong, author of the\r\nOeconomy of Love. On the strength of all this he recommends that another\r\nvolume of the Epistles should be published immediately--being of opinion\r\nthat the readers of the first volume would be sure to purchase the\r\nsecond, and that the publication of the second would put it in the heads\r\nof others to buy the first. Under a sentence containing one of these\r\nsanguine anticipations, there is written, in Sheridan's hand, the word\r\n\"Quixote!\"\r\n\r\nThey were never, of course, called upon for the second part, and,\r\nwhether we consider the merits of the original or of the translation,\r\nthe world has but little to regret in the loss. Aristaenetus is one of\r\nthose weak, florid sophists, who flourished in the decline and\r\ndegradation of ancient literature, and strewed their gaudy flowers of\r\nrhetoric over the dead muse of Greece. He is evidently of a much later\r\nperiod than Alciphron, to whom he is also very inferior in purity of\r\ndiction, variety of subject, and playfulness of irony. But neither of\r\nthem ever deserved to be wakened from that sleep, in which the\r\ncommentaries of Bergler, De Pauw, and a few more such industrious\r\nscholars have shrouded them.\r\n\r\nThe translators of Aristaenetus, in rendering his flowery prose into\r\nverse, might have found a precedent and model for their task in Ben\r\nJonson, whose popular song, \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\" is, as\r\nMr. Cumberland first remarked, but a piece of fanciful mosaic, collected\r\nout of the love-letters of the sophist Philostratus. But many of the\r\nnarrations in Aristaenetus are incapable of being elevated into poetry;\r\nand, unluckily, these familiar parts seem chiefly to have fallen to the\r\ndepartment of Halhed, who was far less gifted than his coadjutor with\r\nthat artist-like touch, which polishes away the mark of vulgarity, and\r\ngives an air of elegance even to poverty. As the volume is not in many\r\nhands, the following extract from one of the Epistles may be acceptable\r\n--as well from the singularity of the scene described, as from the\r\nspecimen it affords of the merits of the translation:\r\n\r\n  \"Listen--another pleasure I display,\r\n  That help'd delightfully the time away.\r\n  From distant vales, where bubbles from its source\r\n  A crystal rill, they dug a winding course:\r\n  See! thro' the grove a narrow lake extends,\r\n  Crosses each plot, to each plantation bends;\r\n  And while the fount in new meanders glides,\r\n  The forest brightens with refreshing tides.\r\n  Tow'rds us they taught the new-born stream to flow,\r\n  Tow'rds us it crept, irresolute and slow;\r\n  Scarce had the infant current crickled by,\r\n  When lo! a wondrous fleet attracts our eye;\r\n  Laden with draughts might greet a monarch's tongue,\r\n  The mimic navigation swam along.\r\n  Hasten, ye ship-like goblets, down the vale,\r\n[Footnote: \"In the original, this luxurious image is pursued so far\r\nthat the very leaf which is represented as the sail of the vessel, is\r\nparticularized as of a medicinal nature, capable of preventing any\r\nill effects the wine might produce.\"--_Note by the Translator.]\r\n  Your freight a flagon, and a leaf your sail;\r\n  O may no envious rush thy course impede,\r\n  Or floating apple stop thy tide-born speed.\r\n    His mildest breath a gentle zephyr gave;\r\n  The little vessels trimly stem'd the wave:\r\n  Their precious merchandise to land they bore,\r\n  And one by one resigned the balmy store.\r\n  Stretch but a hand, we boarded them, and quaft\r\n  With native luxury the tempered draught.\r\n  For where they loaded the nectareous fleet,\r\n  The goblet glow'd with too intense a heat;\r\n  Cool'd by degrees in these convivial ships,\r\n  With nicest taste it met our thirsty lips.\"\r\n\r\nAs a scholar, such as Halhed, could hardly have been led into the\r\nmistake, of supposing [Greek: pa Medika phuxa phullon] to mean \"a leaf\r\nof a medicinal nature,\" we may, perhaps, from this circumstance not less\r\nthan from the superior workmanship of the verses, attribute the whole of\r\nthis Epistle and notes to Sheridan.\r\n\r\nThere is another Epistle, the 12th, as evidently from the pen of his\r\nfriend, the greater part of which is original, and shows, by its\r\nraciness and vigor, what difference there is between \"the first\r\nsprightly runnings\" of an author's own mind, and his cold, vapid\r\ntransfusion of the thoughts of another. From stanza 10th to the end is\r\nall added by the translator, and all spirited--though full of a bold\r\ndefying libertinism, as unlike as possible to the effeminate lubricity\r\nof the poor sophist, upon whom, in a grave, treacherous note, the\r\nresponsibility of the whole is laid. But by far the most interesting\r\npart of the volume is the last Epistle of the book, \"From a Lover\r\nresigning his Mistress to his Friend,\"--in which Halhed has contrived to\r\nextract from the unmeaningness of the original a direct allusion to his\r\nown fate; and, forgetting Aristaenetus and his dull personages, thinks\r\nonly of himself, and Sheridan, and Miss Linley.\r\n\r\n  \"Thee, then, my friend,--if yet a wretch may claim\r\n  A last attention by that once dear name,--\r\n  Thee I address:--the cause you must approve;\r\n  I yield you--what I cannot cease to love.\r\n  Be thine the blissful lot, the nymph be thine:\r\n  I yield my love,--sure, friendship may be mine.\r\n  Yet must no thought of me torment thy breast;\r\n  Forget me, if my griefs disturb thy rest,\r\n  Whilst still I'll pray that thou may'st never know\r\n  The pangs of baffled love, or feel my woe.\r\n  But sure to thee, dear, charming--fatal maid!\r\n  (For me thou'st charmed, and me thou hast betray'd,)\r\n  This last request I need not recommend--\r\n  Forget the lover thou, as he the friend.\r\n  Bootless such charge! for ne'er did pity move\r\n  A heart that mock'd the suit of humble love.\r\n  Yet, in some thoughtful hour--if such can be,\r\n  Where love, Timocrates, is join'd with thee--\r\n  In some lone pause of joy, when pleasures pall,\r\n  And fancy broods o'er joys it can't recall,\r\n  Haply a thought of me, (for thou, my friend,\r\n  May'st then have taught that stubborn heart to bend,)\r\n  A thought of him whose passion was not weak,\r\n  May dash one transient blush upon her cheek;\r\n  Haply a tear--(for I shall surely then\r\n  Be past all power to raise her scorn again--)\r\n  Haply, I say, one self-dried tear may fall:--\r\n  One tear she'll give, for whom I yielded all!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  My life has lost its aim!--that fatal fair\r\n  Was all its object, all its hope or care:\r\n  She was the goal, to which my course was bent,\r\n  Where every wish, where every thought was sent;\r\n  A secret influence darted from her eyes,--\r\n  Each look, attraction, and herself the prize.\r\n  Concentred there, I liv'd for her alone;\r\n  To make her glad and to be blest was one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Adieu, my friend,--nor blame this _sad_ adieu,\r\n  Though sorrow guides my pen, it blames not you.\r\n  Forget me--'tis my pray'r; nor seek to know\r\n  The fate of him whose portion must be woe,\r\n  Till the cold earth outstretch her friendly arms,\r\n  And Death convince me that he _can_ have charms.\"\r\n\r\nBut Halhed's was not the only heart that sighed deeply and hopelessly\r\nfor the young Maid of Bath, who appears, indeed, to have spread her\r\ngentle conquests to an extent almost unparalleled in the annals of\r\nbeauty. Her personal charms, the exquisiteness of her musical talents,\r\nand the full light of publicity which her profession threw upon both,\r\nnaturally attracted round her a crowd of admirers, in whom the sympathy\r\nof a common pursuit soon kindled into rivalry, till she became at length\r\nan object of vanity as well as of love. Her extreme youth, too,--for she\r\nwas little more than sixteen when Sheridan first met her,--must have\r\nremoved, even from minds the most fastidious and delicate, that\r\nrepugnance they might justly have felt to her profession, if she had\r\nlived much longer under its tarnishing influence, or lost, by frequent\r\nexhibitions before the public, that fine gloss of feminine modesty, for\r\nwhose absence not all the talents and accomplishments of the whole sex\r\ncan atone.\r\n\r\nShe had been, even at this early age, on the point of marriage with Mr.\r\nLong, an old gentleman of considerable fortune in Wiltshire, who proved\r\nthe reality of his attachment to her in a way which few young lovers\r\nwould be romantic enough to imitate. On her secretly representing to him\r\nthat she never could be happy as his wife, he generously took upon\r\nhimself the whole blame of breaking off the alliance, and even\r\nindemnified the father, who was proceeding to bring the transaction into\r\ncourt, by settling L3000 upon his daughter. Mr. Sheridan, who owed to\r\nthis liberal conduct not only the possession of the woman he loved, but\r\nthe means of supporting her during the first years of their marriage,\r\nspoke invariably of Mr. Long, who lived to a very advanced age, with all\r\nthe kindness and respect which such a disinterested character merited.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the year 1770 that the Sheridans took up\r\ntheir residence in King's Mead [Footnote: They also lived, during a part\r\nof their stay at Bath, in New King Street.] Street, Bath, where an\r\nacquaintance commenced between them and Mr. Linley's family, which the\r\nkindred tastes of the young people soon ripened into intimacy. It was\r\nnot to be expected,--though parents, in general, are as blind to the\r\nfirst approach of these dangers as they are rigid and unreasonable after\r\nthey have happened,--that such youthful poets and musicians [Footnote:\r\nDr. Burney, in his Biographical Sketch of Mr. Linley, written for Rees'\r\nCyclopaedia, calls the Linley family \"a nest of nightingales.\" The only\r\nsurviving member of this accomplished family is Mr. William Linley,\r\nwhose taste and talent, both in poetry and music, most worthily sustain\r\nthe reputation of the name that he bears.]--should come together without\r\nLove very soon making one of the party. Accordingly the two brothers\r\nbecame deeply enamored of Miss Linley. Her heart, however, was not so\r\nwholly un-preoccupied as to yield at once to the passion which her\r\ndestiny had in store for her. One of those transient preferences, which\r\nin early youth are mistaken for love, had already taken lively\r\npossession of her imagination; and to this the following lines, written\r\nat that time by Mr. Sheridan, allude:\r\n\r\nTO THE RECORDING ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  Cherub of Heaven, that from my secret stand\r\n    Dost note the follies of each mortal here,\r\n  Oh, if Eliza's steps employ thy hand,\r\n    Blot the sad legend with a mortal tear.\r\n  Nor when she errs, through passion's wild extreme,\r\n    Mark then her course, nor heed each trifling wrong;\r\n  Nor, when her sad attachment is her theme,\r\n    Note down the transports of her erring tongue.\r\n  But, when she sighs for sorrows not her own,\r\n    Let that dear sigh to Mercy's cause be given;\r\n  And bear that tear to her Creator's throne,\r\n    Which glistens in the eye upraised to Heaven!\r\n\r\nBut in love, as in everything else, the power of a mind like Sheridan's\r\nmust have made itself felt through all obstacles and difficulties. He\r\nwas not long in winning the entire affections of the young \"Syren,\"\r\nthough the number and wealth of his rivals, the ambitious views of her\r\nfather, and the temptations to which she herself was hourly exposed,\r\nkept his jealousies and fears perpetually on the watch. He is supposed,\r\nindeed, to have been indebted to self-observation for that portrait of a\r\nwayward and morbidly sensitive lover, which he has drawn so strikingly\r\nin the character of Falkland.\r\n\r\nWith a mind in this state of feverish wakefulness, it is remarkable that\r\nhe should so long have succeeded in concealing his attachment from the\r\neyes of those most interested in discovering it. Even his brother\r\nCharles was for some time wholly unaware of their rivalry, and went on\r\nsecurely indulging in a passion which it was hardly possible, with such\r\nopportunities of intercourse, to resist, and which survived long after\r\nMiss Linley's selection of another had extinguished every hope in his\r\nheart, but that of seeing her happy. Halhed, too, who at that period\r\ncorresponded constantly with Sheridan, and confided to him the love with\r\nwhich he also had been inspired by this enchantress, was for a length of\r\ntime left in the same darkness upon the subject, and without the\r\nslightest suspicion that the epidemic had reached his friend, whose only\r\nmode of evading the many tender inquiries and messages with which\r\nHalhed's letters abounded, was by referring to answers which had by some\r\nstrange fatality miscarried, and which, we may conclude, without much\r\nuncharitableness, had never been written.\r\n\r\nMiss Linley went frequently to Oxford, to perform at the oratorios and\r\nconcerts; and it may easily be imagined that the ancient allegory of the\r\nMuses throwing chains over Cupid was here reversed, and the quiet shades\r\nof learning not a little disturbed by the splendor of these \"angel\r\nvisits.\" The letters of Halhed give a lively idea, not only of his own\r\nintoxication, but of the sort of contagious delirium, like that at\r\nAbdera described by Lucian, with which the young men of Oxford were\r\naffected by this beautiful girl. In describing her singing he quotes\r\npart of a Latin letter which he himself had written to a friend upon\r\nfirst hearing her; and it is a curious proof of the readiness of\r\nSheridan, notwithstanding his own fertility, to avail himself of the\r\nthoughts of others, that we find in this extract, word for word, the\r\nsame extravagant comparison of the effects of music to the process of\r\nEgyptian embalmment--\"extracting the brain through the ears\"--which was\r\nafterwards transplanted into the dialogue of the Duenna: \"_Mortuum\r\nquondam ante aegypti medici quam pollincirent cerebella de auribus unco\r\nquodam hamo solebant extrahere; sic de meis auribus non cerebrum, sed\r\ncor ipsum exhausit lusciniola, &c., &c._\" He mentions, as the rivals\r\nmost dreaded by her admirers, Norris, the singer, whose musical talents,\r\nit was thought, recommended him to her, and Mr. Watts, a gentleman\r\ncommoner, of very large fortune.\r\n\r\nWhile all hearts and tongues were thus occupied about Miss Linley, it is\r\nnot wonderful that rumors of matrimony and elopement should, from time\r\nto time, circulate among her apprehensive admirers; or that the usual\r\nill-compliment should be paid to her sex of supposing that wealth must\r\nbe the winner of the prize. It was at one moment currently reported at\r\nOxford that she had gone off to Scotland with a young man of L3,000 a\r\nyear, and the panic which the intelligence spread is described in one of\r\nthese letters to Sheridan, (who, no doubt, shared in it) as producing\r\n\"long faces\" everywhere. Not only, indeed, among her numerous lovers,\r\nbut among all who delighted in her public performances, an alarm would\r\nnaturally be felt at the prospect of her becoming private property:\r\n\r\n  \"_Te juga Taygeti, posito te Maenala flebunt\r\n  Venatu, maestoque diu lugebere Cyntho.\r\n  Delphica quinetiam fratris delubra tacebunt._\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Claudian. De Rapt. Proserp. Lib. ii. v. 244.]\r\n\r\n  Thee, thee, when hurried from our eyes away,\r\n  Laconia's hills shall mourn for many a day--\r\n  The Arcadian hunter shall forget his chase,\r\n  And turn aside to think upon that face;\r\n  While many an hour Apollo's songless shrine\r\n  Shall wait in silence for a voice like thine!\r\n\r\nBut to the honor of her sex, which is, in general, more disinterested\r\nthan the other, it was found that neither rank nor wealth had influenced\r\nher heart in its election; and Halhed, who, like others, had estimated\r\nthe strength of his rivals by their rent-rolls, discovered at last that\r\nhis unpretending friend, Sheridan, (whose advances in courtship and in\r\nknowledge seem to have been equally noiseless and triumphant,) was the\r\nchosen favorite of her, at whose feet so many fortunes lay. Like that\r\nSaint, Cecilia, by whose name she was always called, she had long\r\nwelcomed to her soul a secret visitant, [Footnote: \"The youth, found in\r\nher chamber, had in his hand two crowns or wreaths, the one of lilies,\r\nthe other of roses, which he had brought from Paradise.\"--_Legend of\r\nSt. Cecilia_.] whose gifts were of a higher and more radiant kind\r\nthan the mere wealthy and lordly of this world can proffer. A letter,\r\nwritten by Halhed on the prospect of his departure for India, [Footnote:\r\nThe letter is evidently in answer to one which he had just received from\r\nSheridan, in which Miss Linley had written a few words expressive of her\r\nwishes for his health and happiness. Mr. Halhed sailed for India about\r\nthe latter end of this year.] alludes so delicately to this discovery,\r\nand describes the state of his own heart so mournfully, that I must\r\nagain, in parting with him and his correspondence, express the strong\r\nregret that I feel at not being able to indulge the reader with a\r\nperusal of these letters. Not only as a record of the first short\r\nflights of Sheridan's genius, but as a picture, from the life, of the\r\nvarious feelings of youth, its desires and fears, its feverish hopes and\r\nfanciful melancholy, they could not have failed to be read with the\r\ndeepest interest.\r\n\r\nTo this period of Mr. Sheridan's life we are indebted for most of those\r\nelegant love-verses, which are so well known and so often quoted. The\r\nlines \"Uncouth is this moss-covered grotto of stone,\" were addressed to\r\nMiss Linley, after having offended her by one of those lectures upon\r\ndecorum of conduct, which jealous lovers so frequently inflict upon\r\ntheir mistresses,--and the grotto, immortalized by their quarrel, is\r\nsupposed to have been in Spring Gardens, then the fashionable place of\r\nresort in Bath.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere remarked that the conceit in the following stanza\r\nresembles a thought in some verses of Angerianus:--\r\n\r\n  And thou, stony grot, in thy arch may'st preserve\r\n    Two lingering drops of the night-fallen dew,\r\n  Let them fall on her bosom of snow, and they'll serve\r\n    As tears of my sorrow entrusted to you.\r\n\r\n  _At quum per niveam cervicem influxerit humor\r\n    Dicite non roris sed pluvia haec lacrimae._\r\n\r\nWhether Sheridan was likely to have been a reader of Angerianus is, I\r\nthink, doubtful--at all events the coincidence is curious.\r\n\r\n\"Dry be that tear, my gentlest love,\" is supposed to have been written\r\nat a later period; but it was most probably produced at the time of his\r\ncourtship, for he wrote but few love verses after his marriage--like the\r\nnightingale (as a French editor of Bonefonius says, in remarking a\r\nsimilar circumstance of that poet) \"qui developpe le charme de sa voix\r\ntant qu'il vent plaire a sa compagne--sont-ils unis? il se tait, il n'a\r\nplus le besoin de lui plaire.\" This song having been hitherto printed\r\nincorrectly, I shall give it here, as it is in the copies preserved by\r\nhis relations.\r\n\r\n  Dry be that tear, my gentlest love,\r\n    Be hush'd that struggling sigh,\r\n  Nor seasons, day, nor fate shall prove\r\n    More fix'd, more true than I.\r\n  Hush'd be that sigh, be dry that tear,\r\n  Cease boding doubt, cease anxious fear.--\r\n    Dry be that tear.\r\n\r\n  Ask'st thou how long my love will stay,\r\n    When all that's new is past;--\r\n  How long, ah Delia, can I say\r\n    How long my life will last?\r\n  Dry be that tear, be hush'd that sigh,\r\n  At least I'll love thee till I die.--\r\n    Hush'd be that sigh.\r\n\r\n  And does that thought affect thee too,\r\n    The thought of Sylvio's death,\r\n  That he who only breathed for you,\r\n    Must yield that faithful breath?\r\n  Hush'd be that sigh, be dry that tear,\r\n  Nor let us lose our Heaven here.--\r\n    Dry be that tear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: An Elegy by Halhed, transcribed in one of his letters to\r\nSheridan, begins thus:\r\n\r\n\"Dry be that tear, be hush'd that struggling sigh.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is in the second stanza here a close resemblance to one of the\r\nmadrigals of Montreuil, a French poet, to whom Sir J. Moore was indebted\r\nfor the point of his well known verses, \"If in that breast, so good, so\r\npure.\" [Footnote:\r\n\r\n  The grief that on my quiet preys,\r\n    That rends my heart and checks my tongue,\r\n  I fear will last me all my days,\r\n    And feel it will not last me long.\r\n\r\nIt is thus in Montreuil:\r\n\r\n  C'est un mal que j'aurai tout le terns de ma vie\r\n    Mais je ne l'aurai pas long-tems.]\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan, however, knew nothing of French, and neglected every\r\nopportunity of learning it, till, by a very natural process, his\r\nignorance of the language grew into hatred of it. Besides, we have the\r\nimmediate source from which he derived the thought of this stanza, in\r\none of the essays of Hume, who, being a reader of foreign literature,\r\nmost probably found it in Montreuil. [Footnote: Or in an Italian song of\r\nMenage, from which Montreuil, who was accustomed to such thefts, most\r\nprobably stole it. The point in the Italian is, as far as I can remember\r\nit, expressed thus:\r\n\r\n  In van, o Filli, tu chiedi\r\n  Se lungamente durera Pardore\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Chi lo potrebbe dire?\r\n  Incerta, o Filli, e l'ora del morire.]\r\n\r\nThe passage in Hume (which Sheridan has done little more than versify)\r\nis as follows:--\"Why so often ask me, _How long my love shall yet\r\nendure?_ Alas, my Caelia, can I resolve the question? _Do I know\r\nhow long my life shall yet endure?\"_ [Footnote: The Epicurean]\r\n\r\nThe pretty lines, \"Mark'd you her cheek of rosy hue?\" were written not\r\nupon Miss Linley, as has been generally stated, but upon Lady Margaret\r\nFordyce, and form part of a poem which he published in 1771, descriptive\r\nof the principal beauties of Bath, entitled \"Clio's Protest, or the\r\nPicture varnished,\"--being an answer to some verses by Mr. Miles Peter\r\nAndrews, called \"The Bath Picture,\" in which Lady Margaret was thus\r\nintroduced:\r\n\r\n  \"Remark too the dimpling, sweet smile\r\n  Lady Marg'ret's fine countenance wears.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the passage in Mr. Sheridan's poem, entire; and the\r\nbeauty of the six favorite lines shines out so conspicuously, that we\r\ncannot wonder at their having been so soon detached, like ill-set jems,\r\nfrom the loose and clumsy workmanship around them.\r\n\r\n  \"But, hark!--did not our bard repeat\r\n  The love-born name of M-rg-r-t?--\r\n  Attention seizes every ear;\r\n  \"We pant for the description _here_:\r\n  If ever dulness left thy brow,\r\n  '_Pindar,_' we say, ''twill leave thee now.'\r\n  But O! old Dulness' son anointed\r\n  His mother never disappointed!--\r\n  And here we all were left to seek\r\n  A dimple in F-rd-ce's cheek!\r\n\r\n  \"And could you really discover,\r\n  In gazing those sweet beauties over,\r\n  No other charm, no winning grace,\r\n  Adorning either mind or face,\r\n  But one poor _dimple_ to express\r\n  The _quintessence_ of _loveliness_?\r\n  ....Mark'd you her cheek of rosy hue?\r\n  Mark'd you her eye of sparkling blue?\r\n  That eye in liquid circles moving;\r\n  That cheek abash'd at Man's approving;\r\n  The _one_, Love's arrows darting round;\r\n  The _other_, blushing at the wound:\r\n  Did she not speak, did she not move,\r\n  Now _Pallas_--now the Queen of Love!\"\r\n\r\nThere is little else in this poem worth being extracted, though it\r\nconsists of about four hundred lines; except, perhaps, his picture of a\r\ngood country housewife, which affords an early specimen of that neat\r\npointedness of phrase, which gave his humor, both poetic and dramatic,\r\nsuch a peculiar edge and polish:--\r\n\r\n  \"We see the Dame, in rustic pride,\r\n  A bunch of keys to grace her side,\r\n  Stalking across the well-swept entry,\r\n  To hold her council in the pantry;\r\n  Or, with prophetic soul, foretelling\r\n  The peas will boil well by the shelling;\r\n  Or, bustling in her private closet,\r\n  Prepare her lord his morning posset;\r\n  And, while the hallowed mixture thickens,\r\n  Signing death-warrants for the chickens:\r\n  Else, greatly pensive, poring o'er\r\n  Accounts her cook had thumbed before;\r\n  One eye cast up upon that _great book_,\r\n  Yclep'd _The Family Receipt Book_;\r\n  By which she's ruled in all her courses,\r\n  From stewing figs to drenching horses.\r\n  --Then pans and pickling skillets rise,\r\n  In dreadful lustre, to our eyes,\r\n  With store of sweetmeats, rang'd in order,\r\n  And _potted nothings_ on the border;\r\n  While salves and caudle-cups between,\r\n  With squalling children, close the scene.\"\r\n\r\nWe find here, too, the source of one of those familiar lines, which so\r\nmany quote without knowing whence they come;--one of those stray\r\nfragments, whose parentage is doubtful, but to which (as the law says of\r\nillegitimate children) \"_pater est populus_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"You write with ease, to show your breeding,\r\n  _But easy writing's curst hard reading_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following passage, with more of the tact of a man of the world\r\nthan the ardor of a poet, he dismisses the object nearest his heart with\r\nthe mere passing gallantry of a compliment:--\r\n\r\n  \"O! should your genius ever rise,\r\n  And make you _Laureate_ in the skies,\r\n  I'd hold my life, in twenty years,\r\n  You'd spoil the _music_ of the _spheres_.\r\n  --Nay, should the rapture-breathing Nine\r\n  In one celestial concert join,\r\n  Their sovereign's power to rehearse,\r\n  --Were you to furnish them with verse,\r\n  By Jove, I'd fly the heavenly throng,\r\n  Though _Phoebus_ play'd and _Linley_ sung.\"\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the New Assembly Rooms at Bath, which commenced with a\r\nridotto, Sept. 30, 1771, he wrote a humorous description of the\r\nentertainment, called \"An Epistle from Timothy Screw to his Brother\r\nHenry, Waiter at Almack's,\" which appeared first in the Bath Chronicle,\r\nand was so eagerly sought after, that Crutwell, the editor, was induced\r\nto publish it in a separate form. The allusions in this trifle have, of\r\ncourse, lost their zest by time; and a specimen or two of its humor will\r\nbe all that is necessary here.\r\n\r\n  \"Two rooms were first opened--the _long_ and the _round_ one,\r\n  (These _Hogstyegon_ names only serve to confound one,)\r\n  Both splendidly lit with the new chandeliers,\r\n  With drops hanging down like the bobs at Peg's ears:\r\n  While jewels of _paste_ reflected the rays,\r\n  And _Bristol-stone_ diamonds gave strength to the blaze:\r\n  So that it was doubtful, to view the bright clusters,\r\n  Which sent the most light out, the ear-rings or lustres.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Nor less among you was the medley, ye fair!\r\n  I believe there were some besides quality there:\r\n  Miss _Spiggot_, Miss _Brussels_, Miss _Tape_, and Miss\r\n_Socket_,\r\n  Miss _Trinket_, and aunt, with her leathern pocket,\r\n  With good Mrs. _Soaker_, who made her old chin go,\r\n  For hours, hobnobbing with Mrs. _Syringo_:\r\n  Had Tib staid at home, I b'lieve none would have miss'd her,\r\n  Or pretty _Peg Runt_, with her tight little sister,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDUELS WITH MR. MATHEWS.--MARRIAGE WITH MISS LINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1771, the elder Mr. Sheridan went to\r\nDublin, to perform at the theatre of that city,--leaving his young and\r\nlively family at Bath, with nothing but their hearts and imaginations to\r\ndirect them.\r\n\r\nThe following letters, which passed between him and his son Richard\r\nduring his absence, though possessing little other interest than that of\r\nhaving been written at such a period, will not, perhaps, be unwelcome to\r\nthe reader:--\r\n\r\n\"Dublin, Dec. 7th, 1771.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR RICHARD,\r\n\r\n\"How could you be so wrong-headed as to commence cold bathing at such a\r\nseason of the year, and I suppose without any preparation too? You have\r\npaid sufficiently for your folly, but I hope the ill effects of it have\r\nbeen long since over. You and your brother are fond of quacking, a most\r\ndangerous disposition with regard to health. Let slight things pass away\r\nthemselves; in a case that requires assistance do nothing without\r\nadvice. Mr. Crook is a very able man in his way. Should a physician be\r\nat any time wanting, apply to Dr. Nesbitt, and tell him at leaving Bath\r\nI recommended you all to his care. This indeed I intended to have\r\nmentioned to him, but it slipped my memory. I forgot Mr. Crook's bill,\r\ntoo, but desire I may have the amount by the next letter. Pray what is\r\nthe meaning of my hearing so seldom from Bath? Six weeks here, and but\r\ntwo letters! You were very tardy; what are your sisters about? I shall\r\nnot easily forgive any future omissions. I suppose Charles received my\r\nanswer to his, and the 20_l_ from Whately. I shall order another to\r\nbe sent at Christmas for the rent and other necessaries. I have not time\r\nat present to enter upon the subject of English authors, &c. but shall\r\nwrite to you upon that head when I get a little leisure. Nothing can be\r\nconceived in a more deplorable state than the stage of Dublin. I found\r\ntwo miserable companies opposing and starving each other. I chose the\r\nleast bad of them; and, wretched as they are, it has had no effect on my\r\nnights, numbers having been turned away every time I played, and the\r\nreceipts have been larger than when I had Barry, his wife, and Mrs.\r\nFitz-Henry to play with me. However, I shall not be able to continue it\r\nlong, as there is no possibility of getting up a sufficient number of\r\nplays with such poor materials. I purpose to have done the week after\r\nnext, and apply vigorously to the material point which brought me over.\r\nI find all ranks and parties very zealous for forwarding my scheme, and\r\nhave reason to believe it will be carried in parliament after the\r\nrecess, without opposition. It was in vain to have attempted it before,\r\nfor never was party violence [Footnote: The money-bill, brought forward\r\nthis year under Lord Townsend's administration, encountered violent\r\nopposition, and was finally rejected.] carried to such a height as in\r\nthis sessions; the House seldom breaking up till eleven or twelve at\r\nnight. From these contests, the desire of improving in the article of\r\nelocution is become very general. There are no less than five persons of\r\nrank and fortune now waiting my leisure to become my pupils. Remember me\r\nto all friends, particularly to our good landlord and landlady. I am,\r\nwith love and blessing to you all,\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.--Tell your sisters I shall send the poplins as soon as I can get\r\nan opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n\"We have been for some time in hopes of receiving a letter, that we\r\nmight know that you had acquitted us of neglect in writing. At the same\r\ntime we imagine that the time is not far when writing will be\r\nunnecessary; and we cannot help wishing to know the posture of the\r\naffairs, which, as you have not talked of returning, seem probable to\r\ndetain you longer than you intended. I am perpetually asked when Mr.\r\nSheridan is to have his patent for the theatre, which all the Irish here\r\ntake for granted, and I often receive a great deal of information from\r\nthem on the subject. Yet I cannot help being vexed when I see in the\r\nDublin papers such bustling accounts of the proceedings of your House of\r\nCommons, as I remember it was your argument against attempting any thing\r\nfrom parliamentary authority in England. However, the folks here regret\r\nyou, as one that is to be fixed in another kingdom, and will scarcely\r\nbelieve that you will ever visit Bath at all; and we are often asked if\r\nwe have not received the letter which is to call us over.\r\n\r\n\"I could scarcely have conceived that the winter was so near departing,\r\nwere I not now writing after dinner by daylight. Indeed the first\r\nwinter-season is not yet over at Bath. They have balls, concerts, &c. at\r\nthe rooms, from the old subscription still, and the spring ones are\r\nimmediately to succeed them. They are likewise going to perform\r\noratorios here. Mr. Linley and his whole family, down to the seven year\r\nolds, are to support one set at the new rooms, and a band of singers\r\nfrom London another at the old. Our weather here, or the effects of it,\r\nhave been so uninviting to all kinds of birds, that there has not been\r\nthe smallest excuse to take a gun into the fields this winter;--a point\r\nmore to the regret of Charles than myself.\r\n\r\n\"We are all now in dolefuls for the Princess Dowager; but as there was\r\nno necessity for our being dressed or weeping mourners, we were easily\r\nprovided. Our acquaintances stand pretty much the same as when you left\r\nus,--only that I think in general we are less intimate, by which I\r\nbelieve you will not think us great losers. Indeed, excepting Mr.\r\nWyndham, I have not met with one person with whom I would wish to be\r\nintimate; though there was a Mr. Lutterel, (brother to the Colonel,)--\r\nwho was some months ago introduced to me by an old Harrow acquaintance,\r\n--who made me many professions at parting, and wanted me vastly to name\r\nsome way in which he could be useful to me; but the relying on\r\n_acquaintances_, or _seeking_ of friendships, is a fault which\r\nI think I shall always have prudence to avoid.\r\n\r\n\"Lissy begins to be tormented again with the tooth-ache;--otherwise, we\r\nare all well.\r\n\r\n\"I am, Sir, your sincerely dutiful and affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\"Friday, Feb. 29.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you will not judge of my attention to the improvement of my hand-\r\nwriting by this letter, as I am out of the way of a better pen.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Sheridan, now one-and-twenty, the oldest and gravest of the\r\nparty, finding his passion for Miss Linley increase every day, and\r\nconscious of the imprudence of yielding to it any further, wisely\r\ndetermined to fly from the struggle altogether. Having taken a solemn\r\nfarewell of her in a letter, which his youngest sister delivered, he\r\nwithdrew to a farm-house about seven or eight miles from Bath, little\r\nsuspecting that he left his brother in full possession of that heart, of\r\nwhich he thus reluctantly and hopelessly raised the siege. Nor would\r\nthis secret perhaps have been discovered for some time, had not another\r\nlover, of a less legitimate kind than either, by the alarming\r\nimportunity of his courtship, made an explanation on all sides\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mathews, a married man and intimate with Miss Linley's family,\r\npresuming upon the innocent familiarity which her youth and his own\r\nstation permitted between them, had for some time not only rendered her\r\nremarkable by his indiscreet attentions in public, but had even\r\npersecuted her in private with those unlawful addresses and proposals,\r\nwhich a timid female will sometimes rather endure, than encounter that\r\nshare of the shame, which may be reflected upon herself by their\r\ndisclosure. To the threat of self-destruction, often tried with effect\r\nin these cases, he is said to have added the still more unmanly menace\r\nof ruining, at least, her reputation, if he could not undermine her\r\nvirtue. Terrified by his perseverance, and dreading the consequences of\r\nher father's temper, if this violation of his confidence and hospitality\r\nwere exposed to him, she at length confided her distresses to Richard\r\nSheridan; who, having consulted with his sister, and, for the first\r\ntime, disclosed to her the state of his heart with respect to Miss\r\nLinley, lost no time in expostulating with Mathews, upon the cruelty,\r\nlibertinism, and fruitlessness of his pursuit. Such a remonstrance,\r\nhowever, was but little calculated to conciliate the forbearance of this\r\nprofessed man of gallantry, who, it appears by the following allusion to\r\nhim under the name of Lothario, in a poem written by Sheridan at the\r\ntime, still counted upon the possibility of gaining his object, or, at\r\nleast, blighting the fruit which he could not reach:--\r\n\r\n  Nor spare the flirting _Cassoc'd rogue_,\r\n  Nor ancient Cullin's polish'd brogue;\r\n  Nor gay _Lothario's_ nobler name,\r\n  That _Nimrod_ to all female fame.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this persecution, and an increasing dislike to her\r\nprofession, which made her shrink more and more from the gaze of the\r\nmany, in proportion as she became devoted to the love of one, she\r\nadopted, early in 1772, the romantic resolution of flying secretly to\r\nFrance and taking refuge in a convent,--intending, at the same time, to\r\nindemnify her father, to whom she was bound till the age of 21, by the\r\nsurrender to him of part of the sum which Mr. Long had settled upon her.\r\nSheridan, who, it is probable, had been the chief adviser of her flight,\r\nwas, of course, not slow in offering to be the partner of it. His\r\nsister, whom he seems to have persuaded that his conduct in this affair\r\narose solely from a wish to serve Miss Linley, as a friend, without any\r\ndesign or desire to take advantage of her elopement, as a lover, not\r\nonly assisted them with money out of her little fund for house-expenses,\r\nbut gave them letters of introduction to a family with whom she had been\r\nacquainted at St. Quentin. On the evening appointed for their\r\ndeparture,--while Mr. Linley, his eldest son, and Miss Maria Linley,\r\nwere engaged at a concert, from which the young Cecilia herself had\r\nbeen, on a plea of illness, excused,--she was conveyed by Sheridan in a\r\nsedan-chair from her father's house in the Crescent, to a post-chaise\r\nwhich waited for them on the London road, and in which she found a woman\r\nwhom her lover had hired, as a sort of protecting Minerva, to accompany\r\nthem in their flight.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Sheridan was at this time little more than\r\ntwenty, and his companion just entering her eighteenth year. On their\r\narrival in London, with an adroitness which was, at least, very\r\ndramatic, he introduced her to an old friend of his family, (Mr. Ewart,\r\na respectable brandy-merchant in the city,) as a rich heiress who had\r\nconsented to elope with him to the Continent;--in consequence of which\r\nthe old gentleman, with many commendations of his wisdom for having\r\ngiven up the imprudent pursuit of Miss Linley, not only accommodated the\r\nfugitives with a passage on board a ship, which he had ready to sail\r\nfrom the port of London to Dunkirk, but gave them letters of\r\nrecommendation to his correspondents at that place, who with the same\r\nzeal and dispatch facilitated their journey to Lisle.\r\n\r\nOn their leaving Dunkirk, as was natural to expect, the chivalrous and\r\ndisinterested protector degenerated into a mere selfish lover. It was\r\nrepresented by him, with arguments which seemed to appeal to prudence as\r\nwell as feeling, that, after the step which they had taken, she could\r\nnot possibly appear in England again but as his wife. He was therefore,\r\nhe said, resolved not to deposit her in a convent till she had\r\nconsented, by the ceremony of a marriage, to confirm to him that right\r\nof protecting her, which he had now but temporarily assumed. It did not,\r\nwe may suppose, require much eloquence to convince her heart of the\r\ntruth of this reasoning; and, accordingly, at a little village, not far\r\nfrom Calais, they were married about the latter end of March, 1772, by a\r\npriest well known for his services on such occasions.\r\n\r\nThey thence immediately proceeded to Lisle, where Miss Linley, as she\r\nmust still be called, giving up her intention of going on to St.\r\nQuentin, procured an apartment in a convent, with the determination of\r\nremaining there, till Sheridan should have the means of supporting her\r\nas his acknowledged wife. A letter which he wrote to his brother from\r\nthis place, dated April 15, though it throws but little additional light\r\non the narrative, is too interesting an illustration of it to be omitted\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n\"Dear brother,\r\n\r\n\"Most probably you will have thought me very inexcusable for not having\r\nwrit to you. You will be surprised, too, to be told that, except your\r\nletter just after we arrived, we have never received one line from Bath.\r\nWe suppose for certain that there are letters somewhere, in which case\r\nwe shall have sent to every place almost but the right, whither, I hope,\r\nI have now sent also. You will soon see me in England. Everything on our\r\nside has at last succeeded. Miss L--- is now fixing in a convent, where\r\nshe has been entered some time. This has been a much more difficult\r\npoint than you could have imagined, and we have, I find, been extremely\r\nfortunate. She has been ill, but is now recovered; this, too, has\r\ndelayed me. We would have wrote, but have been kept in the most\r\ntormenting expectation, from day to day, of receiving your letters; but\r\nas everything is now so happily settled here, I will delay no longer\r\ngiving you that information, though probably I shall set out for England\r\nwithout knowing a syllable of what has happened with you. All is well, I\r\nhope; and I hope, too, that though you may have been ignorant, for some\r\ntime, of our proceedings, _you_ never could have been uneasy lest\r\nanything should tempt me to depart, even in a thought, from the honor\r\nand consistency which engaged me at first. I wrote to M--- [Footnote:\r\nMathews] above a week ago, which, I think, was necessary and right. I\r\nhope he has acted the one proper part which was left him; and, to speak\r\nfrom my _feelings_, I cannot but say that I shall be very happy to\r\nfind no further disagreeable consequence pursuing him; for, as Brutus\r\nsays of Caesar, &c.--if I delay one moment longer, I lose the post.\r\n\r\n\"I have writ now, too, to Mr. Adams, and should apologize to you for\r\nhaving writ to him first, and lost my time for you. Love to my sisters,\r\nMiss L--- to all.\r\n\r\n\"Ever, Charles, your affect. Brother,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you that we altered quite our route.\"\r\n\r\nThe illness of Miss Linley, to which he alludes, and which had been\r\noccasioned by fatigue and agitation of mind, came on some days after her\r\nretirement to the convent; but an English physician, Dr. Dolman, of\r\nYork, who happened to be resident at Lisle at the time, was called in to\r\nattend her; and in order that she might be more directly under his care,\r\nhe and Mrs. Dolman invited her to their house, where she was found by\r\nMr. Linley, on his arrival in pursuit of her. After a few words of\r\nprivate explanation from Sheridan, which had the effect of reconciling\r\nhim to his truant daughter, Mr. Linley insisted upon her returning with\r\nhim immediately to England, in order to fulfil some engagements which he\r\nhad entered into on her account; and a promise being given that, as soon\r\nas these engagements were accomplished, she should be allowed to resume\r\nher plan of retirement at Lisle, the whole party set off amicably\r\ntogether for England.\r\n\r\nOn the first discovery of the elopement, the landlord of the house in\r\nwhich the Sheridans resided had, from a feeling of pity for the\r\nsituation of the young ladies,--now left without the protection of\r\neither father or brother,--gone off, at break of day, to the retreat of\r\nCharles Sheridan, and informed him of the event which had just occurred.\r\nPoor Charles, wholly ignorant till then of his brother's attachment to\r\nMiss Linley, felt all that a man may be supposed to feel, who had but\r\ntoo much reason to think himself betrayed, as well as disappointed. He\r\nhastened to Bath, where he found a still more furious lover, Mr.\r\nMathews, inquiring at the house every particular of the affair, and\r\nalmost avowing, in the impotence of his rage, the unprincipled design\r\nwhich this summary step had frustrated. In the course of their\r\nconversation, Charles Sheridan let fall some unguarded expressions of\r\nanger against his brother, which this gentleman, who seems to have been\r\neminently qualified for a certain line of characters indispensable in\r\nall romances, treasured up in his memory, and, as it will appear,\r\nafterwards availed himself of them. For the four or five weeks during\r\nwhich the young couple were absent, he never ceased to haunt the\r\nSheridan family, with inquiries, rumors, and other disturbing\r\nvisitations; and, at length, urged on by the restlessness of revenge,\r\ninserted the following violent advertisement in the Bath Chronicle:\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, April 8th, 1772.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Richard S--- having attempted, in a letter left behind him for that\r\npurpose, to account for his scandalous method of running away from this\r\nplace, by insinuations derogating from _my_ character, and that of\r\na young lady, innocent as far as relates to _me_, or _my_\r\nknowledge; since which he has neither taken any notice of letters, or\r\neven informed his own family of the place where he has hid himself; I\r\ncan no longer think he deserves the treatment of a gentleman, and\r\ntherefore shall trouble myself no further about him than, in this public\r\nmethod, to post him as a L---, and a treacherous S---.\r\n\r\n\"And as I am convinced there have been many malevolent incendiaries\r\nconcerned in the propagation of this infamous lie, if any of them,\r\nunprotected by _age_, _infirmities_, or profession, will dare\r\nto acknowledge the part they have acted, and affirm _to_ what they\r\nhave said _of_ me, they may depend on receiving the proper reward\r\nof their villany, in the most public manner. The world will be candid\r\nenough to judge properly (I make no doubt) of any private abuse on this\r\nsubject for the future; as nobody can defend himself from an accusation\r\nhe is ignorant of.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Mathews.\"\r\n\r\nOn a remonstrance from Miss Sheridan upon this outrageous proceeding, he\r\ndid not hesitate to assert that her brother Charles was privy to it;--a\r\ncharge which the latter with indignation repelled, and was only\r\nprevented by the sudden departure of Mathews to London from calling him\r\nto a more serious account for the falsehood.\r\n\r\nAt this period the party from the Continent arrived; and as a detail of\r\nthe circumstances which immediately followed has been found in Mr.\r\nSheridan's own hand-writing,--drawn up hastily, it appears, at the\r\nParade Coffee-house, Bath, the evening before his second duel with Mr.\r\nMathews,--it would be little better than profanation to communicate them\r\nin any other words.\r\n\r\n\"It has ever been esteemed impertinent to appeal to the public in\r\nconcerns entirely private; but there now and then occurs a\r\n_private_ incident which, by being explained, may be productive of\r\n_public_ advantage. This consideration, and the precedent of a\r\npublic appeal in the same affair, are my only apologies for the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. T. Mathews thought himself essentially injured by Mr. E. Sheridan's\r\nhaving co-operated in the virtuous efforts of a young lady to escape the\r\nsnares of vice and dissimulation. He wrote several most abusive threats\r\nto Mr. S., then in France. He labored, with a cruel industry, to vilify\r\nhis character in England. He publicly posted him as a scoundrel and a\r\nliar. Mr. S. answered him from France (hurried and surprised), that he\r\nwould never sleep in England till he had thanked him as he deserved.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. S. arrived in London at 9 o'clock at night. At 10 he is informed,\r\nby Mr. S. Ewart, that Mr. M. is in town. Mr. S. had sat up at\r\nCanterbury, to keep his idle promise to Mr. M.--He resolved to call on\r\nhim that night, as, in case he had not found him in town, he had called\r\non Mr. Ewart to accompany him to Bath, being bound by Mr. Linley not to\r\nlet anything pass between him and Mr. M. till he had arrived thither.\r\nMr. S. came to Mr. Cochlin's, in Crutched Friars, (where Mr. M. was\r\nlodged,) about half after twelve. The key of Mr. C.'s door was lost; Mr.\r\nS. was denied admittance. By two o'clock he got in. Mr. M. had been\r\npreviously down to the door, and told Mr. S. he should be admitted, and\r\nhad retired to bed again. He dressed, complained of the cold, endeavored\r\nto get heat into him, called Mr. S. his _dear friend_, and forced\r\nhim to--_sit down_.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. S. had been informed that Mr. M. had sworn his death;--that Mr. M.\r\nhad, in numberless companies, produced bills on France, whither he meant\r\nto retire on the completion of his revenge. Mr. M. had warned Mr. Ewart\r\nto advise his friend not even to come in his way without a sword, as he\r\ncould not answer for the consequence.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. M. had left two letters for Mr. S., in which he declares he is to\r\nbe met with at any hour, and begs Mr. S. will not _'deprive himself of\r\nso much sleep, or stand on any ceremony'_. Mr. S. called on him at\r\nthe hour mentioned. Mr. S. was admitted with the difficulty mentioned.\r\nMr. S. declares that, on Mr. M.'s perceiving that he came to answer then\r\nto his challenge, he does not remember ever to have seen a _man_\r\nbehave so perfectly dastardly. Mr. M. detained Mr. S. till seven o'clock\r\nthe next morning. He (Mr. M.) said he never meant to quarrel with Mr. S.\r\nHe convinced Mr. S. that his enmity ought to be directed solely against\r\nhis brother and another gentleman at Bath. Mr. S. went to Bath....\"\r\n[Footnote: The remainder of this paper is omitted, as only briefly\r\nreferring to circumstances which will be found more minutely detailed in\r\nanother document.]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Bath, (whither he travelled with Miss Linley and her\r\nfather,) Sheridan lost not a moment in ascertaining the falsehood of the\r\ncharge against his brother. While Charles, however, indignantly denied\r\nthe flagitious conduct imputed to him by Mathews, he expressed his\r\nopinion of the step which Sheridan and Miss Linley had taken, in terms\r\nof considerable warmth, which were overheard by some of the family. As\r\nsoon as the young ladies had retired to bed, the two brothers, without\r\nany announcement of their intention, set off post together for London,\r\nSheridan having previously written the following letter to Mr. Wade, the\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I ought to apologize to you for troubling you again on a subject which\r\nshould concern so few.\r\n\r\n\"I find Mr. Mathews's behavior to have been such that I cannot be\r\nsatisfied with his _concession_, as a _consequence_ of an\r\n_explanation_ from me. I called on Mr. Mathews last Wednesday night\r\nat Mr. Cochlin's, without the smallest expectation of coming to any\r\n_verbal_ explanation with him. A proposal of a _pacific_\r\nmeeting the next day was the consequence, which ended in those\r\nadvertisements and the letter to you. As for Mr. Mathews's honor or\r\n_spirit_ in this whole affair, I shall only add that a few hours\r\nmay possibly give some proof of the latter; while, in my own\r\njustification, I affirm that it was far from being my fault that this\r\npoint now remains to be determined.\r\n\r\n\"On discovering Mr. Mathews's _benevolent_ interposition in my own\r\nfamily, I have counter-ordered the advertisements that were agreed on,\r\nas I think even an _explanation_ would now misbecome me; an\r\nagreement to them was the effect more of mere _charity_ than\r\n_judgment_. As I find it necessary to make _all_ my sentiments\r\nas public as possible, your declaring this will greatly oblige\r\n\r\n\"G Your very humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sat. 12 o'Clock, May 2d, 1772.\r\n\r\n\"To William Wade, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day (Sunday), when the young gentlemen did not appear,\r\nthe alarm of their sisters was not a little increased, by hearing that\r\nhigh words had been exchanged the evening before, and that it was feared\r\na duel between the brothers would be the consequence. Though unable to\r\ncredit this dreadful surmise, yet full of the various apprehensions\r\nwhich such mystery was calculated to inspire, they had instant recourse\r\nto Miss Linley, the fair _Helen_ of all this strife, as the person\r\nmost likely to be acquainted with their brother Richard's designs, and\r\nto relieve them from the suspense under which they labored. She,\r\nhowever, was as ignorant of the transaction as themselves, and their\r\nmutual distress being heightened by sympathy, a scene of tears and\r\nfainting-fits ensued, of which no less remarkable a person than Doctor\r\nPriestley, who lodged in Mr. Linley's house at the time, happened to be\r\na witness.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the brothers in town, Richard Sheridan instantly\r\ncalled Mathews out. His second on the occasion was Mr. Ewart, and the\r\nparticulars of the duel are thus stated by himself, in a letter which he\r\naddressed to Captain Knight, the second of Mathews, soon after the\r\nsubsequent duel in Bath.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"On the evening preceding my last meeting with Mr. Mathews, Mr. Barnett\r\n[Footnote: The friend of Mathews in the second duel.] produced a paper\r\nto me, written by Mr. Mathews, containing an account of our former\r\nmeetings in London. As I had before frequently heard of Mr. Mathews's\r\nrelation of that affair, without interesting myself much in\r\ncontradicting it, I should certainly have treated this in the same\r\nmanner, had it not been seemingly authenticated by Mr. Knight's name\r\nbeing subscribed to it. My asserting that the paper contains much\r\nmisrepresentation, equivocation, and falsity, might make it appear\r\nstrange that I should apply to you in this manner for information on the\r\nsubject: but, as it likewise contradicts what I have been told were Mr.\r\nKnight's sentiments and assertions on that affair, I think I owe it to\r\nhis credit, as well as my own justification, first, to be satisfied from\r\nhimself whether he really subscribed and will support the truth of the\r\naccount shown by Mr. Mathews. Give me leave previously to relate what\r\n_I_ have affirmed to have been a real state of our meeting in\r\nLondon, and which I am now ready to support on my honor, or my oath, as\r\nthe best account I can give of Mr. Mathews's relation is, that it is\r\nalmost directly opposite to mine.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ewart accompanied me to Hyde Park, about six in the evening, where\r\nwe met you and Mr. Mathews, and we walked together to the ring.--Mr.\r\nMathews refusing to make any other acknowledgment than he had done, I\r\nobserved that we were come to the ground: Mr. Mathews objected to the\r\nspot, and appealed to you.--We proceeded to the back of a building on\r\nthe other side of the ring, the ground was there perfectly level. I\r\ncalled on him and drew my sword (he having previously declined pistols).\r\nMr. Ewart observed a sentinel on the other side of the building; we\r\nadvanced to another part of the park. I stopped again at a seemingly\r\nconvenient place: Mr. Mathews objected to the observation of some people\r\nat a great distance, and proposed to retire to the Hercules' Pillars\r\ntill the park should be clear: we did so. In a little time we returned.\r\n--I again drew my sword; Mr. Mathews again objected to the observation of\r\na person who seemed to watch us. Mr. Ewart observed that the chance was\r\nequal, and engaged that no one should stop him, should it be necessary\r\nfor him to retire to the gate, where we had a chaise and four, which was\r\nequally at his service. Mr. Mathews declared that he would not engage\r\nwhile any one was within sight, and proposed to defer it till next\r\nmorning. I turned to you and said that 'this was trifling work,' that I\r\ncould not admit of any delay, and engaged to remove the gentleman (who\r\nproved to be an officer, and who, on my going up to him, and assuring\r\nhim that any interposition would be ill-timed, politely retired). Mr.\r\nMathews, in the mean time, had returned towards the gate: Mr. Ewart and\r\nI called to you, and followed. We returned to the Hercules' Pillars, and\r\nwent from thence, by agreement, to the Bedford Coffee House, where, the\r\nmaster being alarmed, you came and conducted us to Mr. Mathews at the\r\nCastle Tavern, Henrietta Street. Mr. Ewart took lights up in his hand,\r\nand almost immediately on our entering the room we engaged. I struck Mr.\r\nMathews's point so much out of the line, that I stepped up and caught\r\nhold of his wrist, or the hilt of his sword, while the point of mine was\r\nat his breast. You ran in and caught hold of my arm, exclaiming,\r\n_'don't kill him.'_ I struggled to disengage my arm, and said his\r\nsword was in my power. Mr. Mathews called out twice or thrice, _'I beg\r\nmy life.'_--We were parted. You immediately said, _'there, he has\r\nbegged his life, and now there is an end of it;'_ and, on Mr. Ewart\r\nsaying that, when his sword was in my power, as I attempted no more you\r\nshould not have interfered, you replied that you _were wrong_, but\r\nthat you had _done it hastily, and to prevent mischief_--or words\r\nto that effect. Mr. Mathews then hinted that I was rather _obliged to\r\nyour interposition_ for the advantage; you declared that\r\n'_before_ you did so, both the swords were in Mr. Sheridan's\r\npower.' Mr. Mathews still seemed resolved to give it another turn, and\r\nobserved that _he had never quitted his sword_.--Provoked at this,\r\nI then swore (with too much heat, perhaps) that he should either give up\r\nhis sword and I would break it, or go to his guard again. He refused--\r\nbut, on my persisting, either gave it into my hand, or flung it on the\r\ntable, or the ground (_which_ I will not absolutely affirm). I\r\nbroke it, and flung the hilt to the other end of the room. He exclaimed\r\nat this. I took a mourning sword from Mr. Ewart, and presenting him with\r\nmine, gave my honor that what had passed should never be mentioned by\r\nme, and he might now right himself again. He replied that he _'would\r\nnever draw a sword against the man who had given him his life;'_--\r\nbut, on his still exclaiming against the indignity of breaking his sword\r\n(which he had brought upon himself), Mr. Ewart offered him the pistols,\r\nand some altercation passed between them. Mr. Mathews said, that he\r\n_could never show his face if it were known how his sword was broke--\r\nthat such a thing had never been done--that it cancelled all\r\nobligations, &c. &c._ You seemed to think it was wrong, and we both\r\nproposed, that if he never misrepresented the affair, it should not be\r\nmentioned by us. This was settled. I then asked Mr. Mathews, whether (as\r\nhe had expressed himself sensible of, and shocked at the injustice and\r\nindignity he had done me in his advertisement) it did not occur to him\r\nthat he owed me another satisfaction; and that, as it was now in his\r\npower to do it without discredit, I supposed he would not hesitate. This\r\nhe absolutely refused, unless conditionally; I insisted on it, and said\r\nI would not leave the room till it was settled. After much altercation,\r\nand with much ill-grace, he gave the apology, which afterwards appeared.\r\nWe parted, and I returned immediately to Bath. I, there, to Colonel\r\nGould, Captain Wade, Mr. Creaser, and others, mentioned the affair to\r\nMr. Mathews's credit--said that chance having given me the advantage,\r\nMr. Mathews had consented to that apology, and mentioned nothing of the\r\nsword. Mr. Mathews came down, and in two days I found the whole affair\r\nhad been stated in a different light, and insinuations given out to the\r\nsame purpose as in the paper, which has occasioned this trouble. I had\r\n_undoubted authority_ that these accounts proceeded from Mr.\r\nMathews, and likewise that Mr. Knight had never had any share in them. I\r\nthen thought I no longer owed Mr. Mathews the compliment to conceal any\r\ncircumstance, and I related the affair to several gentlemen exactly as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, as I have put down nothing in this account but upon the most\r\nassured recollection, and as Mr. Mathews's paper either directly or\r\nequivocally contradicts almost every article of it, and as your name is\r\nsubscribed to that paper, I flatter myself that I have a right to expect\r\nyour answer to the following questions:--First,\r\n\r\n\"Is there any falsity or misrepresentation in what I have advanced\r\nabove?\r\n\r\n\"With regard to Mr. Mathews's paper--did I, in the Park, seem in the\r\nsmallest article inclined to enter into conversation with Mr. Mathews?--\r\nHe insinuates that I did.\r\n\r\n\"Did Mr. Mathews not _beg his life_?--He affirms he did not.\r\n\r\n\"Did I break his sword _without warning_?--He affirms I did it\r\nwithout warning, on his laying it on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not offer him mine?--He omits it.\r\n\r\n\"Did Mr. Mathews give me the apology, as a point of generosity, _on my\r\ndesisting to demand it_?--He affirms he did.\r\n\r\n\"I shall now give my reasons for doubting your having authenticated this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"1. Because I think it full of falsehood and misrepresentation, and Mr.\r\nKnight has the character of a man of truth and honor.\r\n\r\n\"2. When you were at Bath, I was informed that you had never expressed\r\nany such sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"3. I have been told that, in Wales, Mr. Mathews never _told his\r\nstory_ in the presence of Mr. Knight, who had never there insinuated\r\nany thing to my disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"4. The paper shown me by Mr. Barnett contains (if my memory does not\r\ndeceive me) three separate sheets of writing paper. Mr. Knight's\r\nevidence is annexed to the last, which contains chiefly a copy of our\r\n_first_ proposed advertisements, which Mr. Mathews had, in Mr.\r\nKnight's presence, agreed should be destroyed as totally void; and which\r\n(in a letter to Colonel Gould, by whom I had insisted on it) he declared\r\nupon his honor he knew nothing about, nor should ever make the least use\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\"These, sir, are my reasons for applying to yourself, in preference to\r\nany appeal to Mr. Ewart, my second on that occasion, which is what I\r\nwould wish to avoid. As for Mr. Mathews's assertions, I shall never be\r\nconcerned at them. I have ever avoided any verbal altercation with that\r\ngentleman, and he has now secured himself from any other.\r\n\r\n\"I am your very humble servant,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till Tuesday morning that the young ladies at Bath were\r\nrelieved from their suspense by the return of the two brothers, who\r\nentered evidently much fatigued, not having been in bed since they left\r\nhome, and produced the apology of Mr. Mathews, which was instantly sent\r\nto Crutwell for insertion. It was in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Being convinced that the expressions I made use of to Mr. Sheridan's\r\ndisadvantage were the effects of passion and misrepresentation, I\r\nretract what I have said to that gentleman's disadvantage, and\r\nparticularly beg his pardon for my advertisement in the Bath Chronicle.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS MATHEWS.\" [Footnote: This appeared in the Bath Chronicle of May\r\n7th. In another part of the same paper there is the following paragraph:\r\n\"We can with authority contradict the account in the London Evening Post\r\nof last night, of a duel between Mr. M--t--ws and Mr. S--r--n, as to\r\nthe time and event of their meeting, Mr. S. having been at his place on\r\nSaturday, and both these gentlemen being here at present.\"]\r\n\r\nWith the odor of this transaction fresh about him, Mr. Mathews retired\r\nto his estate in Wales, and, as he might have expected, found himself\r\nuniversally shunned. An apology may be, according to circumstances,\r\neither the noblest effort of manliness or the last resource of fear, and\r\nit was evident, from the reception which this gentleman experienced\r\nevery where, that the former, at least, was not the class to which his\r\nlate retraction had been referred. In this crisis of his character, a\r\nMr. Barnett, who had but lately come to reside in his neighborhood,\r\nobserving with pain the mortifications to which he was exposed, and\r\nperhaps thinking them, in some degree, unmerited, took upon him to urge\r\nearnestly the necessity of a second meeting with Sheridan, as the only\r\nmeans of removing the stigma left by the first; and, with a degree of\r\nIrish friendliness, not forgotten in the portrait of Sir Lucius\r\nO'Trigger, offered himself to be the bearer of the challenge. The\r\ndesperation of persons, in Mr. Mathews's circumstances, is in general\r\nmuch more formidable than the most acknowledged valor; and we may easily\r\nbelieve that it was with no ordinary eagerness he accepted the proposal\r\nof his new ally, and proceeded with him, full of vengeance, to Bath.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Sheridan, who had but just returned from Ireland, and had\r\nbeen with some little difficulty induced to forgive his son for the wild\r\nachievements he had been engaged in during his absence, was at this time\r\nin London, making arrangements for the departure of his favorite,\r\nCharles, who, through the interest of Mr. Wheatley, an old friend of the\r\nfamily, had been appointed Secretary to the Embassy in Sweden. Miss\r\nLinley--wife and no wife,--obliged to conceal from the world what her\r\nheart would have been most proud to avow, was also absent from Bath,\r\nbeing engaged at the Oxford music-meeting. The letter containing the\r\npreliminaries of the challenge was delivered by Mr. Barnett, with rather\r\nunnecessary cruelty, into the hands of Miss Sheridan, under the pretext,\r\nhowever, that it was a note of invitation for her brother, and on the\r\nfollowing morning, before it was quite daylight, the parties met at\r\nKingsdown--Mr. Mathews, attended by his neighbor Mr. Barnett, and\r\nSheridan by a gentleman of the name of Paumier, nearly as young as\r\nhimself, and but little qualified for a trust of such importance and\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nThe account of the duel, which I shall here subjoin, was drawn up some\r\nmonths after, by the second of Mr. Mathews, and deposited in the hands\r\nof Captain Wade, the master of the ceremonies. Though somewhat partially\r\ncolored, and (according to Mr. Sheridan's remarks upon it, which shall\r\nbe noticed presently) incorrect in some particulars, it is, upon the\r\nwhole, perhaps as accurate a statement as could be expected, and\r\nreceived, as appears by the following letter from Mr. Brereton, (another\r\nof Mr. Sheridan's intimate friends,) all the sanction that Captain\r\nPaumier's concurrence in the truth of its most material facts could\r\nfurnish.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of some reports spread to the disadvantage of Mr.\r\nMathews, it seems he obtained from Mr. Barnett an impartial relation of\r\nthe last affair with Mr. Sheridan, directed to you. This account Mr.\r\nPaumier has seen, and I, at Mr. Mathews's desire, inquired from him if\r\nhe thought it true and impartial: he says it differs, in a few\r\nimmaterial circumstances only, from his opinion, and has given me\r\nauthority to declare this to you.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your most humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) WILLIAM BRERETON.\r\n\r\n\"Bath, Oct. 24, 1772.\"\r\n\r\n_Copy of a Paper left by Mr. Barnett in the hands of Captain William\r\nWade, Master of the Ceremonies at Bath._\r\n\r\n\"On quitting our chaises at the top of Kingsdown, I entered into a\r\nconversation with Captain Paumier, relative to some preliminaries I\r\nthought ought to be settled in an affair which was likely to end very\r\nseriously;--particularly the method of using their pistols, which Mr.\r\nMathews had repeatedly signified his desire to use prior to swords, from\r\na conviction that Mr. Sheridan would run in on him, and an\r\nungentlemanlike scuffle probably be the consequence. This, however, was\r\nrefused by Mr. Sheridan, declaring he had no pistols: Captain Paumier\r\nreplied he had a brace (which I know were loaded).--By my advice, Mr.\r\nMathews's were not loaded, as I imagined it was always customary to load\r\non the field, which I mentioned to Captain Paumier at the White-Hart,\r\nbefore we went out, and desired he would draw his pistols. He replied,\r\nas they were already loaded, and they going on a public road at that\r\ntime of the morning, he might as well let them remain so, till we got to\r\nthe place appointed; when he would on his honor draw them, which I am\r\nconvinced he would have done had there been time; but Mr. Sheridan\r\nimmediately drew his sword, and, in a vaunting manner, desired Mr.\r\nMathews to draw (their ground was very uneven, and near the post-\r\nchaises).--Mr. Mathews drew; Mr. Sheridan advanced on him at first; Mr.\r\nMathews in turn advanced fast on Mr. Sheridan; upon which he retreated,\r\ntill he very suddenly ran in upon Mr. Mathews, laying himself\r\nexceedingly open, and endeavoring to get hold of Mr. Mathews's sword;\r\nMr. Mathews received him on his point, and, I believe, disengaged his\r\nsword from Mr. Sheridan's body, and gave him another wound; which, I\r\nsuppose, must have been either against one of his ribs, or his breast-\r\nbone, as his sword broke, which I imagine happened from the resistance\r\nit met with from one of those parts; but whether it was broke by that,\r\nor on the closing, I cannot aver.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mathews, I think, on finding his sword broke, laid hold of Mr.\r\nSheridan's sword-arm, and tripped up his heels: they both fell; Mr.\r\nMathews was uppermost, with the hilt of his sword in his hand, having\r\nabout six or seven inches of the blade to it, with which I saw him give\r\nMr. Sheridan, as I imagined, a skin-wound or two in the neck; for it\r\ncould be no more,--the remaining part of the sword being broad and\r\nblunt; he also beat him in the face either with his fist or the hilt of\r\nhis sword. Upon this I turned from them, and asked Captain Paumier if we\r\nshould not take them up; but I cannot say whether he heard me or not, as\r\nthere was a good deal of noise; however, he made no reply. I again\r\nturned to the combatants, who were much in the same situation: I found\r\nMr. Sheridan's sword was bent, and he slipped his hand up the small part\r\nof it, and gave Mr. Mathews a slight wound in the left part of his\r\nbelly: I that instant turned again to Captain Paumier, and proposed\r\nagain our taking them up. He in the same moment called out, 'Oh! he is\r\nkilled, he is killed!'--I as quick as possible turned again, and found\r\nMr. Mathews had recovered the point of his sword, that was before on the\r\nground, with which he had wounded Mr. Sheridan in the belly: I saw him\r\ndrawing the point out of the wound. By this time Mr. Sheridan's sword\r\nwas broke, which he told us.--Captain Paumier called out to him, 'My\r\ndear Sheridan, beg your life, and I will be yours for ever.' I also\r\ndesired him to ask his life: he replied, 'No, by God, I won't.' I then\r\ntold Captain Paumier it would not do to wait for those punctilios (or\r\nwords to that effect), and desired he would assist me in taking them up.\r\nMr. Mathews most readily acquiesced first, desiring me to see Mr.\r\nSheridan was disarmed. I desired him to give me the tuck, which he\r\nreadily did, as did Mr. Sheridan the broken part of his sword to Captain\r\nPaumier. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Mathews both got up; the former was helped\r\ninto one of the chaises, and drove off for Bath, and Mr. Mathews made\r\nthe best of his way for London.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of this narrative I declare, on the word and honor of a\r\ngentleman, to be exactly true; and that Mr. Mathews discovered as much\r\ngenuine, cool, and intrepid resolution as man could do.\r\n\r\n\"I think I may be allowed to be an impartial relater of facts, as my\r\nmotive for accompanying Mr. Mathews was no personal friendship, (not\r\nhaving any previous intimacy, or being barely acquainted with him,) but\r\nfrom a great desire of clearing up so ambiguous an affair, without\r\nprejudice to either party,--which a stranger was judged the most proper\r\nto do,--particularly as Mr. Mathews had been blamed before for taking a\r\nrelation with him on a similar occasion.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) WILLIAM BARNETT.\r\n\r\n\"October, 1772.\" [Footnote: The following account is given as an\r\n\"Extract of a Letter from Bath,\" in the St. James's Chronicle, July 4:\r\n\"Young Sheridan and Captain Mathews of this town, who lately had a\r\nrencontre in a tavern in London, upon account of the maid of Bath, Miss\r\nLinley, have had another this morning upon Kingsdown, about four miles\r\nhence. Sheridan is much wounded, but whether mortally or not is yet\r\nuncertain. Both their swords breaking upon the first lunge, they threw\r\neach other down, and with the broken pieces hacked at each other,\r\nrolling upon the ground, the seconds standing by, quiet spectators.\r\nMathews is but slightly wounded, and is since gone off.\" The Bath\r\nChronicle, on the day after the duel, (July 2d,) gives the particulars\r\nthus: \"This morning, about three o'clock, a second duel was fought with\r\nswords, between Captain Mathews and Mr. R. Sheridan, on Kingsdown, near\r\nthis city, in consequence of their former dispute respecting an amiable\r\nyoung lady, which Mr. M. considered as improperly adjusted; Mr. S.\r\nhaving, since their first rencontre, declared his sentiments respecting\r\nMr. M. in a manner that the former thought required satisfaction. Mr.\r\nSheridan received three or four wounds in his breast and sides, and now\r\nlies very ill. Mr. M. was only slightly wounded, and left this city soon\r\nafter the affair was over.\"]\r\n\r\nThe comments which Mr. Sheridan thought it necessary to make upon this\r\nnarrative have been found in an unfinished state among his papers; and\r\nthough they do not, as far as they go, disprove anything material in its\r\nstatements, (except, perhaps, with respect to the nature of the wounds\r\nwhich he received,) yet, as containing some curious touches of\r\ncharacter, and as a document which he himself thought worth preserving,\r\nit is here inserted.\r\n\r\n\"To William Barnett, Esq.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"It has always appeared to me so impertinent for individuals to appeal\r\nto the public on transactions merely private, that I own the most\r\napparent necessity does not prevent my entering into such a dispute\r\nwithout an awkward consciousness of its impropriety. Indeed, I am not\r\nwithout some apprehension, that I may have no right to plead your having\r\nled the way in my excuse; as it appears not improbable that some ill-\r\nwisher to you, Sir, and the cause you have been engaged in, betrayed you\r\nfirst into this _exact narrative,_ and then exposed it to the\r\npublic eye, under pretence of vindicating your friend. However, as it is\r\nthe opinion of some of my friends, that I ought not to suffer these\r\npapers to pass wholly unnoticed, I shall make a few observations on them\r\nwith that moderation which becomes one who is highly conscious of the\r\nimpropriety of staking his single assertion against the apparent\r\ntestimony of three. This, I say, would be an impropriety, as I am\r\nsupposed to write to those who are not acquainted with the parties. I\r\nhad some time ago a copy of these papers from Captain Wade, who informed\r\nme that they were lodged in his hands, to be made public only by\r\njudicial authority. I wrote to you, Sir, on the subject, to have from\r\nyourself an avowal that the account was yours; but as I received no\r\nanswer, I have reason to compliment you with the supposition that you\r\nare not the author of it. However, as the name _William Barnett_ is\r\nsubscribed to it, you must accept my apologies for making use of that as\r\nthe ostensible signature of the writer--Mr. Paumier likewise (the\r\ngentleman who went out with me on that occasion in the character of a\r\nsecond) having assented to everything material in it, I shall suppose\r\nthe whole account likewise to be his; and as there are some\r\ncircumstances which could come from no one but Mr. Mathews, I shall\r\n(without meaning to take from its authority) suppose it to be Mr.\r\nMathews's also.\r\n\r\n\"As it is highly indifferent to me whether the account I am to observe\r\non be considered as accurately true or not, and I believe it is of very\r\nlittle consequence to any one else, I shall make those observations just\r\nin the same manner as I conceive any indifferent person of common sense,\r\nwho should think it worth his while to peruse the matter with any degree\r\nof attention. In this light, the _truth_ of the articles which are\r\nasserted under Mr. Barnett's name is what I have no business to meddle\r\nwith; but if it should appear that this _accurate narrative_\r\nfrequently contradicts itself as well as all probability, and that there\r\nare some positive facts against it, which do not depend upon any one's\r\nassertion, I must repeat that I shall either compliment Mr. Barnett's\r\njudgment, in supposing it not his, or his humanity in proving the\r\n_narrative_ to partake of that confusion and uncertainty, which his\r\nwell-wishers will plead to have possessed him in the transaction. On\r\nthis account, what I shall say on the subject need be no further\r\naddressed to you; and, indeed, it is idle, in my opinion, to address\r\neven the publisher of a newspaper on a point that can concern so few,\r\nand ought to have been forgotten by them. This you must take as my\r\nexcuse for having neglected the matter so long.\r\n\r\n\"The first point in Mr. Barnett's narrative that is of the least\r\nconsequence to take notice of, is, where Mr. M. is represented as having\r\nrepeatedly signified his desire to use pistols prior to swords, from a\r\nconviction that Mr. Sheridan would run in upon him, and an\r\nungentlemanlike scuffle probably be the consequence. This is one of\r\nthose articles which evidently must be given to Mr. Mathews: for, as Mr.\r\nB.'s part is simply to relate a matter of fact, of which he was an eye-\r\nwitness, he is by no means to answer for Mr. Mathews's _private\r\nconvictions_. As this insinuation bears an obscure allusion to a past\r\ntransaction of Mr. M.'s, I doubt not but he will be surprised at my\r\nindifference in not taking the trouble even to explain it. However, I\r\ncannot forbear to observe here, that had I, at the period which this\r\npassage alludes to, known what was the theory which Mr. M. held of\r\n_gentlemanly scuffle_, I might, possibly, have been so unhappy as\r\nto put it out of his power ever to have brought it into practice.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. B. now charges me with having cut short a number of pretty\r\npreliminaries, concerning which he was treating with Captain Paumier, by\r\ndrawing my sword, and, in a vaunting manner, desiring Mr. M. to draw.\r\nThough I acknowledge (with deference to these gentlemen) the full right\r\nof interference which seconds have on such occasions, yet I may remind\r\nMr. B. that he was acquainted with my determination with regard to\r\npistols before we went on the Down, nor could I have expected it to have\r\nbeen proposed. 'Mr. M. drew; Mr. S. advanced, &c.:'--here let me remind\r\nMr. B. of a circumstance, which I am convinced his memory will at once\r\nacknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper ends here: but in a rougher draught of the same letter (for\r\nhe appears to have studied and corrected it with no common care) the\r\nremarks are continued, in a hand not very legible, thus:\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. B. here represents me as drawing my sword in a _vaunting_\r\nmanner. This I take to be a reflection; and can only say, that a\r\nperson's demeanor is generally regulated by their idea of their\r\nantagonist, and, for what I know, I may now be writing in a vaunting\r\nstyle. Here let me remind Mr. B. of an omission, which, I am convinced,\r\nnothing but want of recollection could occasion, yet which is a material\r\npoint in an exact account of such an affair, nor does it reflect in the\r\nleast on Mr. M. Mr. M. could not possibly have drawn his sword on my\r\ncalling to him, as.... [Footnote: It is impossible to make any\r\nconnected sense of the passage that follows.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. B.'s account proceeds, that I 'advanced first on Mr. M.,' &c. &c.;\r\n'which, (says Mr. B.) I imagine, happened from the resistance it met\r\nwith from one of those parts; but whether it was broke by that, or on\r\nthe closing, I cannot aver.' How strange is the confusion here!--First,\r\nit certainly broke;--whether it broke against rib or no, doubtful;--\r\nthen, indeed, whether it broke at all, uncertain.... But of all times\r\nMr. B. could not have chosen a worse than this for Mr. M.'s sword to\r\nbreak; for the relating of the action unfortunately carries a\r\ncontradiction with it;--since if, on closing, Mr. M. received me on his\r\npoint, it is not possible for him to have made a lunge of such a nature\r\nas to break his sword against a rib-bone. But as the time chosen is\r\nunfortunate, so is the place on which it is said to have broke,--as Mr.\r\nB. might have been informed, by inquiring of the surgeons, that I had no\r\nwounds on my breast or rib with the point of a sword, they being the\r\nmarks of the jagged and blunted part.\"\r\n\r\nHe was driven from the ground to the White-Hart; where Ditcher and\r\nSharpe, the most eminent surgeons of Bath, attended and dressed his\r\nwounds,--and, on the following day, at the request of his sisters, he\r\nwas carefully removed to his own home. The newspapers which contained\r\nthe account of the affair, and even stated that Sheridan's life was in\r\ndanger, reached the Linleys at Oxford, during the performance, but were\r\nanxiously concealed from Miss Linley by her father, who knew that the\r\nintelligence would totally disable her from appearing. Some persons who\r\nwere witnesses of the performance that day, still talk of the touching\r\neffect which her beauty and singing produced upon all present--aware, as\r\nthey were, that a heavy calamity had befallen her, of which she herself\r\nwas perhaps the only one in the assembly ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn her way back to Bath, she was met at some miles from the town by a\r\nMr. Panton, a clergyman, long intimate with the family, who, taking her\r\nfrom her father's chaise into his own, employed the rest of the journey\r\nin cautiously breaking to her the particulars of the alarming event that\r\nhad occurred. Notwithstanding this precaution, her feelings were so\r\ntaken by surprise, that in the distress of the moment, she let the\r\nsecret of her heart escape, and passionately exclaimed, \"My husband! my\r\nhusband!\"--demanding to see him, and insisting upon her right as his\r\nwife to be near him, and watch over him day and night. Her entreaties,\r\nhowever, could not be complied with; for the elder Mr. Sheridan, on his\r\nreturn from town, incensed and grieved at the catastrophe to which his\r\nson's imprudent passion had led, refused for some time even to see him,\r\nand strictly forbade all intercourse between his daughters and the\r\nLinley family. But the appealing looks of a brother lying wounded and\r\nunhappy, had more power over their hearts than the commands of a father,\r\nand they, accordingly, contrived to communicate intelligence of the\r\nlovers to each other.\r\n\r\nIn the following letter, addressed to him by Charles at this time, we\r\ncan trace that difference between the dispositions of the brothers,\r\nwhich, with every one except their father, rendered Richard, in spite of\r\nall his faults, by far the most popular and beloved of the two.\r\n\r\n\"London, July 3d, 1772.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR DICK,\r\n\r\n\"It was with the deepest concern I received the late accounts of you,\r\nthough it was somewhat softened by the assurance of your not being in\r\nthe least danger. You cannot conceive the uneasiness it occasioned to my\r\nfather. Both he and I were resolved to believe the best, and to suppose\r\nyou safe, but then we neither of us could approve of the cause in which\r\nyou suffer. All your friends here condemned you. You risked every thing,\r\nwhere you had nothing to gain, to give your antagonist the thing he\r\nwished, a chance for recovering his reputation. Your courage was past\r\ndispute:--he wanted to get rid of the contemptible opinion he was held\r\nin, and you were good-natured enough to let him do it at your expense.\r\nIt is not now a time to scold, but all your friends were of opinion you\r\ncould, with the greatest propriety, have refused to meet him. For my\r\npart, I shall suspend my judgment till better informed, only I cannot\r\nforgive your preferring swords.\r\n\r\n\"I am exceedingly unhappy at the situation I leave you in with respect\r\nto money matters, the more so as it is totally out of my power to be of\r\nany use to you. Ewart was greatly vexed at the manner of your drawing\r\nfor the last L20.--I own, I think with some reason.\r\n\r\n\"As to old Ewart, what you were talking about is absolutely impossible;\r\nhe is already surprised at Mr. Linley's long delay, and, indeed, I think\r\nthe latter much to blame in this respect. I did intend to give you some\r\naccount of myself since my arrival here, but you cannot conceive how I\r\nhave been hurried,--even much pressed for time at this _present\r\nwriting_. I must therefore conclude, with wishing you speedily\r\nrestored to health, and that if I could make your purse as whole as that\r\nwill shortly be, I hope, it would make me exceedingly happy.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Dick, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"C. F. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that the suspicion of their marriage, which Miss Linley's\r\nunguarded exclamation had suggested, was gaining ground in the mind of\r\nboth fathers,--who seemed equally determined to break the tie, if they\r\ncould arrive at some positive proof of its existence,--Sheridan wrote\r\nfrequently to his young wife, (who passed most of this anxious period\r\nwith her relations at Wells,) cautioning her against being led into any\r\nacknowledgment, which might further the views of the elders against\r\ntheir happiness. Many methods were tried upon both sides, to ensnare\r\nthem into a confession of this nature; but they eluded every effort, and\r\npersisted in attributing the avowal which had escaped from Miss Linley,\r\nbefore Mr. Panton, and others, to the natural agitation and bewilderment\r\ninto which her mind was thrown at the instant.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sheridan was sufficiently recovered of his wounds, [Footnote:\r\nThe Bath Chronicle of the 9th of July has the following paragraph: \"It\r\nis with great pleasure we inform our readers that Mr. Sheridan is\r\ndeclared by his surgeon to be out of danger.\"] his father, in order to\r\ndetach him, as much as possible, from the dangerous recollections which\r\ncontinually presented themselves in Bath, sent him to pass some months\r\nat Waltham Abbey, in Essex, under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Parker of\r\nFarm Hill, his most particular friends. In this retirement, where he\r\ncontinued, with but few and short intervals of absence, from August or\r\nSeptember, 1772, till the spring of the following year, it is probable\r\nthat, notwithstanding the ferment in which his heart was kept, he\r\noccasionally and desultorily occupied his hours in study. Among other\r\nproofs of industry, which I have found among his manuscripts, and which\r\nmay possibly be referred to this period, is an abstract of the History\r\nof England--nearly filling a small quarto volume of more than a hundred\r\npages, closely written. I have also found in his early hand-writing (for\r\nthere was a considerable change in his writing afterwards) a collection\r\nof remarks on Sir William Temple's works, which may likewise have been\r\namong the fruits of his reading at Waltham Abbey.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are confined chiefly to verbal criticism, and prove, in\r\nmany instances, that he had not yet quite formed his taste to that\r\nidiomatic English, which was afterwards one of the great charms of his\r\nown dramatic style. For instance, he objects to the following phrases:--\r\n\"Then I _fell to_ my task again.\"--\"These things _come_, with\r\ntime, to be habitual.\"--\"By which these people _come_ to be either\r\nscattered or destroyed.\"--\"Which alone could pretend to _contest_\r\nit with them:\" (upon which phrase he remarks, \"It refers to nothing\r\nhere:\") and the following graceful idiom in some verses by Temple:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thy busy head can find no gentle rest\r\n  For thinking on the events,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nSome of his observations, however, are just and tasteful. Upon the Essay\r\n\"Of Popular Discontents,\" after remarking, that \"Sir W. T. opens all his\r\nEssays with something as foreign to the purpose as possible,\" he has the\r\nfollowing criticism:--\"Page 260, 'Represent misfortunes for faults, and\r\n_mole-hills_ for _mountains_,'--the metaphorical and literal\r\nexpression too often coupled. P. 262, 'Upon these four wheels the\r\nchariot of state may in all appearance drive easy and safe, or at least\r\nnot be too much _shaken_ by the usual _roughness_ of ways,\r\nunequal _humors_ of _men_, or any common accidents,'--another\r\ninstance of the confusion of the metaphorical and literal expression.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the passages he quotes from Temple's verses, as faulty, is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n       \"--that we may _see_,\r\n  Thou art indeed the empress of the _sea_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious enough that he himself was afterwards guilty of nearly as\r\nillicit a rhyme in his song \"When 'tis night,\" and always defended it:--\r\n\r\n  \"But when the fight's _begun_,\r\n  Each serving at his _gun_.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever grounds there may be for referring these labors of Sheridan to\r\nthe period of his retirement at Waltham Abbey, there are certainly but\r\nfew other intervals in his life that could be selected as likely to have\r\nafforded him opportunities of reading. Even here, however, the fears and\r\nanxieties that beset him were too many and incessant to leave much\r\nleisure for the pursuits of scholarship. However, a state of excitement\r\nmay be favorable to the development of genius--which is often of the\r\nnature of those seas, that become more luminous the more they are\r\nagitated,--for a student, a far different mood is necessary; and in\r\norder to reflect with clearness the images that study presents, the mind\r\nshould have its surface level and unruffled.\r\n\r\nThe situation, indeed, of Sheridan was at this time particularly\r\nperplexing. He had won the heart, and even hand, of the woman he loved,\r\nyet saw his hopes of possessing her farther off than ever. He had twice\r\nrisked his life against an unworthy antagonist, yet found the\r\nvindication of his honor still incomplete, from the misrepresentations\r\nof enemies, and the yet more mischievous testimony of friends. He felt\r\nwithin himself all the proud consciousness of genius, yet, thrown on the\r\nworld without even a profession, looked in vain for a channel through\r\nwhich to direct its energies. Even the precarious hope, which his\r\nfather's favor held out, had been purchased by an act of duplicity which\r\nhis conscience could not approve; for he had been induced, with the\r\nview, perhaps, of blinding his father's vigilance, not only to promise\r\nthat he would instantly give up a pursuit so unpleasing to him, but to\r\ntake \"an oath equivocal\" that he never would marry Miss Linley.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of these various anxieties upon so young and so ardent a\r\nmind, and their effects in alternately kindling and damping its spirit,\r\ncould only have been worthily described by him who felt them, and there\r\nstill exist some letters which he wrote during this time, to a gentleman\r\nwell known as one of his earliest and latest friends. I had hoped that\r\nsuch a picture, as these letters must exhibit, of his feelings at that\r\nmost interesting period of his private life, would not have been lost to\r\nthe present work. But scruples--over-delicate, perhaps, but respectable,\r\nas founded upon a systematic objection to the exposure of _any_\r\npapers, received under the seal of private friendship--forbid the\r\npublication of these precious documents. The reader must, therefore, be\r\nsatisfied with the few distant glimpses of their contents, which are\r\nafforded by the answers of his correspondent, found among the papers\r\nentrusted to me. From these it appears, that through all his letters the\r\nsame strain of sadness and despondency prevailed,--sometimes breaking\r\nout into aspirings of ambition, and sometimes rising into a tone of\r\ncheerfulness, which but ill concealed the melancholy under it. It is\r\nevident also, and not a little remarkable, that in none of these\r\noverflowings of his confidence, had he as yet suffered the secret of his\r\nFrench marriage with Miss Linley to escape; and that his friend\r\naccordingly knew but half the wretched peculiarities of his situation.\r\nLike most lovers, too, imagining that every one who approached his\r\nmistress must be equally intoxicated with her beauty as himself, he\r\nseems anxiously to have cautioned his young correspondent (who\r\noccasionally saw her at Oxford and at Bath) against the danger that lay\r\nin such irresistible charms. From another letter, where the writer\r\nrefers to some message, which Sheridan had requested him to deliver to\r\nMiss Linley, we learn, that she was at this time so strictly watched, as\r\nto be unable to achieve--what to an ingenious woman is seldom difficult\r\n--an answer to a letter which her lover had contrived to convey to her.\r\n\r\nIt was at first the intention of the elder Mr. Sheridan to send his\r\ndaughters, in the course of this autumn, under the care of their brother\r\nRichard, to France. But, fearing to entrust them to a guardian who\r\nseemed himself so much in need of direction, he altered his plan, and,\r\nabout the beginning of October, having formed an engagement for the\r\nensuing winter with the manager of the Dublin theatre, gave up his house\r\nin Bath, and set out with his daughters for Ireland. At the same time\r\nMr. Grenville, (afterwards Marquis of Buckingham,) who had passed a\r\ngreat part of this and the preceding summer at Bath, for the purpose of\r\nreceiving instruction from Mr. Sheridan in elocution, went also to\r\nDublin on a short visit, accompanied by Mr. Cleaver, and by his brother\r\nMr. Thomas Grenville--between whom and Richard Sheridan an intimacy had\r\nat this period commenced, which continued with uninterrupted cordiality\r\never after.\r\n\r\nSome time previous to the departure of the elder Mr. Sheridan for\r\nIreland, having taken before a magistrate the depositions of the\r\npostillions who were witnesses of the duel at Kingsdown, he had\r\nearnestly entreated of his son to join him in a prosecution against\r\nMathews, whose conduct on the occasion he and others considered as by no\r\nmeans that of a fair and honorable antagonist. It was in contemplation\r\nof a measure of this nature, that the account of the meeting already\r\ngiven was drawn up by Mr. Barnett, and deposited in the hands of Captain\r\nWade. Though Sheridan refused to join in legal proceedings--from an\r\nunwillingness, perhaps, to keep Miss Linley's name any longer afloat\r\nupon public conversation--yet this revival of the subject, and the\r\nconflicting statements to which it gave rise, produced naturally in both\r\nparties a relapse of angry feelings, which was very near ending in a\r\nthird duel between them. The authenticity given by Captain Paumier's\r\nname to a narrative which Sheridan considered false and injurious, was\r\nfor some time a source of considerable mortification to him; and it must\r\nbe owned, that the helpless irresolution of this gentleman during the\r\nduel, and his weak acquiescence in these misrepresentations afterwards,\r\nshowed him as unfit to be trusted with the life as with the character of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nHow nearly this new train of misunderstanding had led to another\r\nexplosion, appears from one of the letters already referred to, written\r\nin December, and directed to Sheridan at the Bedford Coffee-house,\r\nCovent Garden, in which the writer expresses the most friendly and\r\nanxious alarm at the intelligence which he has just received,--implores\r\nof Sheridan to moderate his rage, and reminds him how often he had\r\nresolved never to have any concern with Mathews again. Some explanation,\r\nhowever, took place, as we collect from a letter dated a few days later;\r\nand the world was thus spared not only such an instance of inveteracy,\r\nas three duels between the same two men would have exhibited, but,\r\nperhaps, the premature loss of a life to which we are indebted, for an\r\nexample as noble in its excitements, and a lesson as useful in its\r\nwarnings, as ever genius and its errors have bequeathed to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe following Lent, Miss Linley appeared in the oratorios at Covent\r\nGarden; and Sheridan, who, from the nearness of his retreat to London,\r\n(to use a phrase of his own, repeated in one of his friend's letters),\r\n\"trod upon the heels of perilous probabilities,\" though prevented by the\r\nvigilance of her father from a private interview, had frequent\r\nopportunities of seeing her in public. Among many other stratagems which\r\nhe contrived, for the purpose of exchanging a few words with her, he\r\nmore than once disguised himself as a hackney-coachman, and drove her\r\nhome from the theatre.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that a serious misunderstanding at this time\r\noccurred between them,--originating probably in some of those paroxysms\r\nof jealousy, into which a lover like Sheridan must have been continually\r\nthrown, by the numerous admirers and pursuers of all kinds, which the\r\nbeauty and celebrity of his mistress attracted. Among various alliances\r\ninvented for her by the public at this period, it was rumored that she\r\nwas about to be married to Sir Thomas Clarges; and in the Bath Chronicle\r\nof April, 1773, a correspondence is given as authentic between her and\r\n\"Lord Grosvenor,\" which, though pretty evidently a fabrication, yet\r\nproves the high opinion entertained of the purity of her character. The\r\ncorrespondence is thus introduced, in a letter to the editor:--\"The\r\nfollowing letters are confidently said to have passed between Lord G---r\r\nand the celebrated English syren, Miss L--y. I send them to you for\r\npublication, not with any view to increase the volume of literary\r\nscandal, which, I am sorry to say, at present needs no assistance, but\r\nwith the most laudable intent of setting an example for our modern\r\nbelles, by holding out the character of a young woman, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the solicitations of her profession, and the flattering\r\nexample of higher ranks, has added _incorruptible virtue_ to a\r\nnumber of the most elegant qualifications.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have caused the misunderstanding between her and her lover,\r\na reconcilement was with no great difficulty effected, by the mediation\r\nof Sheridan's young friend, Mr. Ewart; and, at length, after a series of\r\nstratagems and scenes, which convinced Mr. Linley that it was impossible\r\nmuch longer to keep them asunder, he consented to their union, and on\r\nthe 13th of April, 1773, they were married by license [Footnote: Thus\r\nannounced in the Gentleman's Magazine:--\"Mr. Sheridan of the Temple to\r\nthe celebrated Miss Linley of Bath.\"]--Mr. Ewart being at the same time\r\nwedded to a young lady with whom he also had eloped clandestinely to\r\nFrance, but was now enabled, by the forgiveness of his father, to\r\ncomplete this double triumph of friendship and love.\r\n\r\nA curious instance of the indolence and procrastinating habits of\r\nSheridan used to be related by Woodfall, as having occurred about this\r\ntime. A statement of his conduct in the duels having appeared in one of\r\nthe Bath papers, so false and calumnious as to require an immediate\r\nanswer, he called upon Woodfall to request that his paper might be the\r\nmedium of it. But wishing, as he said, that the public should have the\r\nwhole matter fairly before them, he thought it right that the offensive\r\nstatement should first be inserted, and in a day or two after be\r\nfollowed by his answer, which would thus come with more relevancy and\r\neffect. In compliance with his wish, Woodfall lost not a moment in\r\ntranscribing the calumnious article into his columns--not doubting, of\r\ncourse, that the refutation of it would be furnished with still greater\r\neagerness. Day after day, however, elapsed, and, notwithstanding\r\nfrequent applications on the one side, and promises on the other, not a\r\nline of the answer was ever sent by Sheridan,--who, having expended all\r\nhis activity in assisting the circulation of the poison, had not\r\nindustry enough left to supply the antidote. Throughout his whole life,\r\nindeed, he but too consistently acted upon the principles, which the\r\nfirst Lord Holland used playfully to impress upon his son:--\"Never do\r\nto-day what you can possibly put off till to-morrow, nor ever do,\r\nyourself, what you can get any one else to do for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES.--FRAGMENTS OF ESSAYS FOUND AMONG HIS PAPERS.--\r\nCOMEDY OF \"THE RIVALS.\"--ANSWER TO \"TAXATION NO TYRANNY.\"--FARCE OF \"ST.\r\nPATRICK'S DAY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few weeks previous to his marriage, Sheridan, had been entered a\r\nstudent of the Middle Temple. It was not, however, to be expected that\r\ntalents like his, so sure of a quick return of fame and emolument, would\r\nwait for the distant and dearly-earned emoluments which a life of labor\r\nin this profession promises. Nor, indeed, did his circumstances admit of\r\nany such patient speculation. A part of the sum which Mr. Long had\r\nsettled upon Miss Linley, and occasional assistance from her father (his\r\nown having withdrawn all countenance from him), were now the only\r\nresources, besides his own talents, left him. The celebrity of Mrs.\r\nSheridan as a singer was, it is true, a ready source of wealth; and\r\noffers of the most advantageous kind were pressed upon them, by managers\r\nof concerts both in town and country. But with a pride and delicacy,\r\nwhich received the tribute of Dr. Johnson's praise, he rejected at once\r\nall thoughts of allowing her to reappear in public; and, instead of\r\nprofiting by the display of his wife's talents, adopted the manlier\r\nresolution of seeking an independence by his own. An engagement had been\r\nmade for her some months before by her father, to perform at the music-\r\nmeeting that was to take place at Worcester this summer. But Sheridan,\r\nwho considered that his own claims upon her had superseded all others,\r\nwould not suffer her to keep this engagement.\r\n\r\nHow decided his mind was upon the subject will appear from the following\r\nletter, written by him to Mr. Linley about a month after his marriage,\r\nand containing some other interesting particulars, that show the\r\ntemptations with which his pride had, at this time, to struggle:--\r\n\r\n\"East Burnham, May 12, 1773.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I purposely deferred writing to you till I should have settled\r\n_all_ matters in London, and in some degree settled ourselves at\r\nour little home. Some unforeseen delays prevented my finishing with\r\nSwale till Thursday last, when everything was concluded. I likewise\r\nsettled with him for his own account, as he brought it to me, and, for a\r\n_friendly_ bill, it is pretty decent.--Yours of the 3d instant did\r\nnot reach me till yesterday, by reason of its missing us at Morden. As\r\nto the principal point it treats of, I had given my answer some days\r\nago, to Mr. Isaac of Worcester. He had enclosed a letter to Storace for\r\nmy wife, in which he dwells much on the nature of the agreement you had\r\nmade for her eight months ago, and adds, that 'as this is no new\r\napplication, but a request that you (Mrs. S.) will fulfil a positive\r\nengagement, the breach of which would prove of fatal consequence to our\r\nmeeting, I hope Mr. Sheridan will think his honor in some degree\r\nconcerned in fulfilling it.'--Mr. Storace, in order to enforce Mr.\r\nIsaac's argument, showed me his letter on the same subject to him, which\r\nbegins with saying, 'We must have Mrs. Sheridan, somehow or other, if\r\npossible!'--the plain English of which is that, if her husband is not\r\nwilling to let her perform, we will persuade him that he acts\r\n_dishonorably_ in preventing her from fulfilling a _positive\r\nengagement_. This I conceive to be the very worst mode of application\r\nthat could have been taken; as there really is not common sense in the\r\nidea that my _honor_ can be concerned in my wife's fulfilling an\r\nengagement, which it is impossible she should ever have made.--Nor (as I\r\nwrote to Mr. Isaac) can you, who gave the promise, whatever it was, be\r\nin the least charged with the breach of it, as your daughter's marriage\r\nwas an event which must always have been looked to by them as quite as\r\nnatural a period to your right over her as her death. And, in my\r\nopinion, it would have been just as reasonable to have applied to you to\r\nfulfil your engagement in the latter case as in the former. As to the\r\n_imprudence_ of declining this engagement, I do not think, even\r\nwere we to suppose that my wife should ever on any occasion appear again\r\nin public, there would be the least at present. For instance, I have had\r\na gentleman with me from Oxford (where they do not claim the least\r\n_right_ as from an engagement), who has endeavored to place the\r\nidea of my complimenting the University with Betsey's performance in the\r\nstrongest light of advantage to me. This he said, on my declining to let\r\nher perform on any agreement. He likewise informed me, that he had just\r\nleft Lord North (the Chancellor), who, he assured me, would look upon it\r\nas the highest compliment, and had expressed himself so to him. Now,\r\nshould it be a point of inclination or convenience to me to break my\r\nresolution with regard to Betsey's performing, there surely would be\r\nmore sense in obliging Lord North (and probably from _his own_\r\napplication) and the University, than Lord Coventry and Mr. Isaac. For,\r\nwere she to sing at Worcester, there would not be the least compliment\r\nin her performing at Oxford. Indeed, they would have a right to _claim\r\nit_--particularly, as that is the mode of application they have\r\nchosen from Worcester. I have mentioned the Oxford matter merely as an\r\nargument, that I can have no kind of inducement to accept of the\r\nproposal from Worcester. And, as I have written fully on the subject to\r\nMr. Isaac, I think there will be no occasion for you to give any further\r\nreasons to Lord Coventry--only that I am sorry I cannot accept of his\r\nproposal, civilities, &c. &c., and refer him for my motives to Mr.\r\nIsaac, as what I have said to you on the subject I mean for you only,\r\nand, if more remains to be argued on the subject in general, we must\r\ndefer it till we meet, which you have given us reason to hope will not\r\nbe long first.\r\n\r\n\"As this is a letter of business chiefly, I shall say little of our\r\nsituation and arrangement of affairs, but that I think we are as happy\r\nas those who wish us best could desire. There is but one thing that has\r\nthe least weight upon me, though it is one I was prepared for. But time,\r\nwhile it strengthens the other blessings we possess, will, I hope, add\r\nthat to the number. You will know that I speak with regard to my father.\r\nBetsey informs me you have written to him again--have you heard from\r\nhim?....\r\n\r\n\"I should hope to hear from you very soon, and I assure you, you shall\r\nnow find me a very exact correspondent; though I hope you will not give\r\nme leave to confirm my character in that respect before we meet.\r\n\r\n\"As there is with this a letter for Polly and you, I shall only charge\r\nyou with mine and Betsey's best love to her, mother, and Tom, &c. &c.,\r\nand believe me your sincere friend and affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nAt East Burnham, from whence this letter is dated, they were now living\r\nin a small cottage, to which they had retired immediately on their\r\nmarriage, and to which they often looked back with a sigh in after-\r\ntimes, when they were more prosperous, but less happy. It was during a\r\nvery short absence from this cottage, that the following lines were\r\nwritten by him:--\r\n\r\n  \"Teach me, kind Hymen, teach, for thou\r\n  Must be my only tutor now,--\r\n  Teach me some innocent employ,\r\n  That shall the hateful thought destroy,\r\n  That I this whole long night must pass\r\n  In exile from my love's embrace.\r\n  Alas, thou hast no wings, oh Time!\r\n[Footnote: It will be perceived that the eight following lines are the\r\nfoundation of the song \"What bard, oh Time,\" in the Duenna.]\r\n  It was some thoughtless lover's rhyme,\r\n  Who, writing in his Chloe's view,\r\n  Paid her the compliment through you.\r\n  For had he, if he truly lov'd,\r\n  But once the pangs of absence prov'd,\r\n  He'd cropt thy wings, and, in their stead,\r\n  Have painted thee with heels of lead.\r\n  But 'tis the temper of the mind,\r\n  Where we thy regulator find.\r\n  Still o'er the gay and o'er the young\r\n  unfelt steps you flit along,--\r\n  As Virgil's nymph o'er ripen'd corn,\r\n  With such ethereal haste was borne,\r\n  That every stock, with upright head,\r\n  Denied the pressure of her tread.\r\n  But o'er the wretched, oh, how slow\r\n  And heavy sweeps thy scythe of woe!\r\n  Oppress'd beneath each stroke they bow,\r\n  Thy course engraven on their brow:\r\n  A day of absence shall consume\r\n  The glow of youth and manhood's bloom,\r\n  And one short night of anxious fear\r\n  Shall leave the wrinkles of a year.\r\n  For me who, when I'm happy, owe\r\n  No thanks to fortune that I'm so,\r\n  Who long have learned to look at one\r\n  Dear object, and at one alone,\r\n  For all the joy, or all the sorrow,\r\n  That gilds the day, or threats the morrow,\r\n  I never felt thy footsteps light,\r\n  But when sweet love did aid thy flight,\r\n  And, banish'd from his blest dominion,\r\n  I cared not for thy borrowed pinion.\r\n\r\n  True, she is mine, and, since she's mine,\r\n  At trifles I should not repine;\r\n  But oh, the miser's real pleasure\r\n  Is not in knowing he has treasure;\r\n  He must behold his golden store,\r\n  And feel, and count his riches o'er.\r\n  Thus I, of one dear gem possest,\r\n  And in that treasure only blest,\r\n  There every day would seek delight,\r\n  And clasp the casket every night.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the winter they went to lodge for a short time with Storace, the\r\nintimate friend of Mr. Linley, and in the following year attained that\r\nfirst step of independence, a house to themselves; Mr. Linley having\r\nkindly supplied the furniture of their new residence, which was in\r\nOrchard-Street, Portman-Square. During the summer of 1774, they passed\r\nsome time at Mr. Canning's and Lord Coventry's; but, so little did these\r\nvisits interfere with the literary industry of Sheridan, that, as\r\nappears from the following letter, written to Mr. Linley in November, he\r\nhad not only at that time finished his play of the Rivals, but was on\r\nthe point of \"sending a hook to the press:\"--\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Nov. 17th 1774.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to attempt to make as many apologies as my long omission in\r\nwriting to you requires, I should have no room for any other subject.\r\nOne excuse only I shall bring forward, which is, that I have been\r\nexceedingly employed, and I believe _very profitably_. However,\r\nbefore I explain how, I must ease my mind on a subject that much more\r\nnearly concerns me than any point of business or profit. I must premise\r\nto you that Betsey is now very well, before I tell you abruptly that she\r\nhas encountered another disappointment, and consequent indisposition....\r\nHowever, she is now getting entirely over it, and she shall never take\r\nany journey of the kind again. I inform you of this now, that you may\r\nnot be alarmed by any accounts from some other quarter, which might lead\r\nyou to fear she was going to have such an illness as last year, of which\r\nI assure you, upon my honor, there is not the least apprehension. If I\r\ndid not write now, Betsey would write herself, and in a day she will\r\nmake you quite easy on this head.\r\n\r\n\"I have been very seriously at work on a book, which I am just now\r\nsending to the press, and which I think will do me some credit, if it\r\nleads to nothing else. However, the profitable affair is of another\r\nnature. There will be a _Comedy_ of mine in rehearsal at Covent-\r\nGarden within a few days. I did not set to work on it till within a few\r\ndays of my setting out for _Crome_, so you may think I have not,\r\nfor these last six weeks, been very idle. I have done it at Mr. Harris's\r\n(the manager's) own request; it is now complete in his hands, and\r\npreparing for the stage. He, and some of his friends also who have heard\r\nit, assure me in the most flattering terms that there is not a doubt of\r\nits success. It will be very well played, and Harris tells me that the\r\nleast shilling I shall get (if it succeeds) will be six hundred pounds.\r\nI shall make no secret of it towards the time of representation, that it\r\nmay not lose any support my friends can give it. I had not written a\r\nline of it two months ago, except a scene or two, which I believe you\r\nhave seen in an odd act of a little farce.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanley was with me a day or two ago on the subject of the\r\noratorios. I found Mr. Smith has declined, and is retiring to Bath. Mr.\r\nStanley informed me that on his applying to the king for the continuance\r\nof his favor, he was desired by his Majesty to make me an offer of Mr.\r\nSmith's situation and partnership in them, and that he should continue\r\nhis protection, &c. I declined the matter very civilly and very\r\nperemptorily. I should imagine that Mr. Stanley would apply to you;--I\r\nstarted the subject to him, and said you had twenty Mrs. Sheridans more.\r\nHowever, he said very little:--if he does, and you wish to make an\r\nalteration in your system at once, I should think you may stand in\r\nSmith's place. I would not listen to him on any other terms, and I\r\nshould think the King might be made to signify his pleasure for such an\r\narrangement. On this you will reflect, and if any way strikes you that I\r\ncan move in it, I need not add how happy I shall be in its success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will let me have the pleasure to hear from you soon, as I\r\nshall think any delay unfair,--unless you can plead that you are writing\r\nan opera, and a folio on music besides. Accept Betsey's love and duty.\r\n\r\n\"Your sincere and affectionate\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the book here alluded to was, I cannot with any accuracy ascertain.\r\nBesides a few sketches of plays and poems, of which I shall give some\r\naccount in a subsequent Chapter, there exist among his papers several\r\nfragments of Essays and Letters, all of which--including the unfinished\r\nplays and poems--must have been written by him in the interval between\r\n1769, when he left Harrow, and the present year; though at what precise\r\ndates during that period there are no means of judging.\r\n\r\nAmong these there are a few political Letters, evidently designed for\r\nthe newspapers;--some of them but half copied out, and probably never\r\nsent. One of this description, which must have been written immediately\r\non his leaving school, is a piece of irony against the Duke of Grafton,\r\ngiving reasons why that nobleman should not lose his head, and, under\r\nthe semblance of a defence, exaggerating all the popular charges against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe first argument (he says) of the Duke's adversaries, \"is founded on\r\nthe regard which ought to be paid to justice, and on the good effects\r\nwhich, they affirm, such an example would have, in suppressing the\r\nambition of any future minister. But if I can prove that his ---- might\r\nbe made a much greater example of by being suffered to live, I think I\r\nmay, without vanity, affirm that their whole argument will fall to the\r\nground. By pursuing the methods which they propose, viz. chopping off\r\nhis ----'s head, I allow the impression would be stronger at first; but\r\nwe should consider how soon that wears off. If, indeed, his ----'s\r\ncrimes were of such a nature, as to entitle his head to a place on\r\nTemple-Bar, I should allow some weight to their argument. But, in the\r\npresent case, we should reflect how apt mankind are to relent after they\r\nhave inflicted punishment;--so that, perhaps, the same men who would\r\nhave detested the noble Lord, while alive and in prosperity, pointing\r\nhim as a scarecrow to their children, might, after being witnesses to\r\nthe miserable fate that had overtaken him, begin in their hearts to pity\r\nhim; and from the fickleness so common to human nature, perhaps, by way\r\nof compensation, acquit him of part of his crimes; insinuate that he was\r\ndealt hardly with, and thus, by the remembrance of their compassion, on\r\nthis occasion, be led to show more indulgence to any future offender in\r\nthe same circumstances.\" There is a clearness of thought and style here\r\nvery remarkable in so young a writer.\r\n\r\nIn affecting to defend the Duke against the charge of fickleness and\r\nunpunctuality, he says, \"I think I could bring several instances which\r\nshould seem to promise the greatest steadiness and resolution. I have\r\nknown him make the Council wait, on the business of the whole nation,\r\nwhen he has had an appointment to Newmarket. Surely, this is an instance\r\nof the greatest honor; and, if we see him so punctual in private\r\nappointments, must we not conclude that he is infinitely more so in\r\ngreater matters? Nay, when W----s [Footnote: Wilkes.] came over, is it\r\nnot notorious that the late Lord Mayor went to His Grace on that\r\nevening, proposing a scheme which, by securing this fire-brand, might\r\nhave put an end to all the troubles he has caused? But His Grace did not\r\nsee him;--no, he was a man of too much honor;--he had _promised_\r\nthat evening to attend Nancy Parsons to Ranelagh, and he would not\r\ndisappoint her, but made three thousand people witnesses of his\r\npunctuality.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another Letter, which happens to be dated (1770), addressed to\r\n\"Novus,\"--some writer in Woodfall's Public Advertiser,--and appearing to\r\nbe one of a series to the same correspondent. From the few political\r\nallusions introduced in this letter, (which is occupied chiefly in an\r\nattack upon the literary style of \"Novus,\") we can collect that the\r\nobject of Sheridan was to defend the new ministry of Lord North, who\r\nhad, in the beginning of that year, succeeded the Duke of Grafton.\r\nJunius was just then in the height of his power and reputation; and as,\r\nin English literature, one great voice always produces a multitude of\r\nechoes, it was thought at that time indispensable to every letter-writer\r\nin a newspaper, to be a close copyist of the style of Junius: of course,\r\nour young political tyro followed this \"mould of form\" as well as the\r\nrest. Thus, in addressing his correspondent:--\"That gloomy seriousness\r\nin your style,--that seeming consciousness of superiority, together with\r\nthe consideration of the infinite pains it must have cost you to have\r\nbeen so elaborately wrong,--will not suffer me to attribute such\r\nnumerous errors to any thing but real ignorance, joined with most\r\nconsummate vanity.\" The following is a specimen of his acuteness in\r\ncriticising the absurd style of his adversary:--\"You leave it rather\r\ndubious whether you were most pleased with the glorious opposition to\r\nCharles I. or the dangerous designs of that monarch, which you\r\nemphatically call 'the arbitrary projects of a Stuart's nature.' What do\r\nyou mean by the projects of a man's _nature_? A man's natural\r\ndisposition may urge him to the commission of some actions;--Nature may\r\ninstigate and encourage, but I believe you are the first that ever made\r\nher a projector.\"\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe, that, while he thus criticises the style and\r\nlanguage of his correspondent, his own spelling, in every second line,\r\nconvicts him of deficiency in at least one common branch of literary\r\nacquirement:--we find _thing_ always spelt _think_;--\r\n_whether_, _where_, and _which_, turned into\r\n_wether_, _were_, and _wich_;--and double _m's_ and\r\n_s's_ almost invariably reduced to \"single blessedness.\" This sign\r\nof a neglected education remained with him to a very late period, and,\r\nin his hasty writing, or scribbling, would occasionally recur to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nFrom these Essays for the newspapers it may be seen how early was the\r\nbias of his mind towards politics. It was, indeed, the rival of\r\nliterature in his affections during all the early part of his life, and,\r\nat length,--whether luckily for himself or not it is difficult to say,--\r\ngained the mastery.\r\n\r\nThere are also among his manuscripts some commencements of Periodical\r\nPapers, under various names, \"The Detector,\" \"The Dramatic Censor,\"\r\n&c.;--none of them, apparently, carried beyond the middle of the first\r\nnumber. But one of the most curious of these youthful productions is a\r\nLetter to the Queen, recommending the establishment of an Institution,\r\nfor the instruction and maintenance of young females in the better\r\nclasses of life, who, from either the loss of their parents, or from\r\npoverty, are without the means of being brought up suitably to their\r\nstation. He refers to the asylum founded by Madame de Maintenon, at St.\r\nCyr, as a model, and proposes that the establishment should be placed\r\nunder the patronage of Her Majesty, and entitled \"The Royal Sanctuary.\"\r\nThe reader, however, has to arrive at the practical part of the plan,\r\nthrough long and flowery windings of panegyric, on the beauty, genius,\r\nand virtue of women, and their transcendent superiority, in every\r\nrespect, over men.\r\n\r\nThe following sentence will give some idea of the sort of eloquence with\r\nwhich he prefaces this grave proposal to Her Majesty:--\"The dispute\r\nabout the proper sphere of women is idle. That men should have attempted\r\nto draw a line for their orbit, shows that God meant them for comets,\r\nand above our jurisdiction. With them the enthusiasm of poetry and the\r\nidolatry of love is the simple voice of nature.\" There are, indeed, many\r\npassages of this boyish composition, a good deal resembling in their\r\nstyle those ambitious apostrophes with which he afterwards ornamented\r\nhis speeches on the trial of Hastings.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeds to remark to Her Majesty, that in those countries where\r\n\"man is scarce better than a brute, he shows his degeneracy by his\r\ntreatment of women,\" and again falls into metaphor, not very clearly\r\nmade out:--\"The influence that women have over us is as the medium\r\nthrough which the finer Arts act upon us. The incense of our love and\r\nrespect for them creates the atmosphere of our souls, which corrects and\r\nmeliorates the beams of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is in a better style:--\"However, in savage countries,\r\nwhere the pride of man has not fixed the first dictates of ignorance\r\ninto law, we see the real effects of nature. The wild Huron shall, to\r\nthe object of his love, become gently as his weary rein-deer;--he shall\r\npresent to her the spoil of his bow on his knee;-he shall watch without\r\nreward the cave where she sleeps;--he shall rob the birds for feathers\r\nfor her hair, and dive for pearls for her neck;--her look shall be his\r\nlaw, and her beauties his worship!\" He then endeavors to prove that, as\r\nit is the destiny of man to be ruled by woman, he ought, for his own\r\nsake, to render her as fit for that task as possible:--\" How can we be\r\nbetter employed than in perfecting that which governs us? The brighter\r\nthey are, the more we shall be illumined. Were the minds of all women\r\ncultivated by inspiration, men would become wise of course. They are a\r\nsort of pentagraphs with which nature writes on the heart of man;--what\r\n_she_ delineates on the original map will appear on the copy.\"\r\n\r\nIn showing how much less women are able to struggle against adversity\r\nthan men, he says,--\"As for us, we are born in a state of warfare with\r\npoverty and distress. The sea of adversity is our natural element, and\r\nhe that will not buffet with the billows deserves to sink. But you, oh\r\nyou, by nature formed of gentler kind, can _you_ endure the biting\r\nstorm? shall you be turned to the nipping blast, and not a door be open\r\nto give you shelter?\"\r\n\r\nAfter describing, with evident seriousness, the nature of the\r\ninstitution of Madame de Maintenon, at St. Cyr, he adds the following\r\nstrange romantic allusion: \"Had such a charity as I have been speaking\r\nof existed here, the mild _Parthenia_ and my poor _Laura_\r\nwould not have fallen into untimely graves.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical details of his plan, in which it is equally evident that\r\nhe means to be serious, exhibit the same flightiness of language and\r\nnotions. The King, he supposes, would have no objection to \"grant\r\nHampton-Court, or some other palace, for the purpose;\" and \"as it is (he\r\ncontinues, still addressing the Queen) to be immediately under your\r\nmajesty's patronage, so should your majesty be the first member of it.\r\nLet the constitution of it be like that of a university, Your Majesty,\r\nChancellor; some of the first ladies in the kingdom sub-chancellors;\r\nwhose care it shall be to provide instructors of real merit. The classes\r\nare to be distinguished by age--none by degree. For, as their\r\nqualification shall be gentility, they are all on a level. The\r\ninstructors shall be women, except for the languages. Latin and Greek\r\nshould not be learned;--the frown of pedantry destroys the blush of\r\nhumility. The practical part of the sciences, as of astronomy, &c.,\r\nshould be taught. In history they would find that there are other\r\npassions in man than love. As for novels, there are some I would\r\nstrongly recommend; but romances infinitely more. The one is a\r\nrepresentation of the effects of the passions as they should be, though\r\nextravagant; the other, as they are. The latter is falsely called\r\nnature, and is a picture of depraved and corrupted society; the other is\r\nthe glow of nature. I would therefore exclude all novels that show human\r\nnature depraved:--however well executed, the design will disgust.\"\r\n\r\nHe concludes by enumerating the various good effects which the examples\r\nof female virtue, sent forth from such an institution, would produce\r\nupon the manners and morals of the other sex; and in describing, among\r\nother kinds of coxcombs, the cold, courtly man of the world, uses the\r\nfollowing strong figure: \"They are so clipped, and rubbed, and polished,\r\nthat God's image and inscription is worn from them, and when He calls in\r\nhis coin, He will no longer know them for his own.\"\r\n\r\nThere is still another Essay, or rather a small fragment of an Essay, on\r\nthe letters of Lord Chesterfield, which, I am inclined to think, may\r\nhave formed a part of the rough copy of the book, announced by him to\r\nMr. Linley as ready in the November of this year. Lord Chesterfield's\r\nLetters appeared for the first time in 1774, and the sensation they\r\nproduced was exactly such as would tempt a writer in quest of popular\r\nsubjects to avail himself of it. As the few pages which I have found,\r\nand which contain merely scattered hints of thoughts, are numbered as\r\nhigh as 232, it is possible that the preceding part of the work may have\r\nbeen sufficiently complete to go into the printer's hands, and that\r\nthere,--like so many more of his \"unshelled brood,\"--it died without\r\never taking wing. A few of these memorandums will, I have no doubt, be\r\nacceptable to the reader.\r\n\r\n\"Lord C.'s whole system in no one article calculated to make a great\r\nman.--A noble youth should be ignorant of the things he wishes him to\r\nknow;--such a one as he wants would be _too soon_ a man.\r\n\r\n\"Emulation is a dangerous passion to encourage, in some points, in young\r\nmen; it is so linked with envy: if you reproach your son for not\r\nsurpassing his school-fellows, he will hate those who are before him.\r\nEmulation not to be encouraged even in virtue. True virtue will, like\r\nthe Athenian, rejoice in being surpassed; a friendly emulation cannot\r\nexist in two minds; one must hate the perfections in which he is\r\neclipsed by the other;--thus, from hating the quality in his\r\ncompetitor, he loses the respect for it in himself:--a young man by\r\nhimself better educated than two.--A Roman's emulation was not to excel\r\nhis countrymen, but to make his country excel: this is the true, the\r\nother selfish.--Epaminondas, who reflected on the pleasure his success\r\nwould give his father, most glorious;--an emulation for that purpose,\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n\"The selfish vanity of the father appears in all these letters--his\r\nsending the copy of a letter for his sister.--His object was the praise\r\nof his own mode of education.--How much more noble the affection of\r\nMorni in Ossian; 'Oh, that the name of Morni,' &c. &c. [Footnote: \"Oh,\r\nthat the name of Morni were forgot among the people; that the heroes\r\nwould only say, 'Behold the father of Gaul!'\" Sheridan applied this,\r\nmore than thirty years after, in talking of his own son, on the hustings\r\nof Westminster, and said that, in like manner, he would ask no greater\r\ndistinction than for men to point at him and say, \"There goes the father\r\nof Tom Sheridan.\"]\r\n\r\n\"His frequent directions for constant employment entirely ill founded:\r\n--a wise man is formed more by the action of his own thoughts than by\r\ncontinually feeding it. 'Hurry,' he says, 'from play to study; never be\r\ndoing nothing'--I say, 'Frequently be unemployed; sit and think.'\r\n_There are on every subject but a few leading and fixed ideas; their\r\ntracks may be traced by your own genius as well as by reading_:--a\r\nman of deep thought, who shall have accustomed himself to support or\r\nattack all he has read, will soon find nothing new: thought is exercise,\r\nand the mind, like the body, must not be wearied.\"\r\n\r\nThese last two sentences contain the secret of Sheridan's confidence in\r\nhis own powers. His subsequent success bore him out in the opinions he\r\nthus early expressed, and might even have persuaded him that it was in\r\nconsequence, not in spite, of his want of cultivation that he succeeded.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1775, the comedy of The Rivals was brought out\r\nat Covent-Garden, and the following was the cast of the characters on\r\nthe first night:--\r\n\r\nSir Anthony Absolute      _Mr. Shuter_.\r\nCaptain Absolute          _Mr. Woodward_.\r\nFalkland                  _Mr. Lewis_.\r\nAcres                     _Mr. Quick_.\r\nSir Lucius O'Trigger      _Mr. Lee_.\r\nFag                       _Mr. Lee Lewes_.\r\nDavid                     _Mr. Dunstal_.\r\nCoachman                  _Mr. Fearon_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Malaprop             _Mrs. Green_.\r\nLydia Languish            _Miss Barsanti_.\r\nJulia                     _Mrs. Bulkley_.\r\nLucy                      _Mrs. Lessingham_.\r\n\r\nThis comedy, as is well known, failed on its first representation,--\r\nchiefly from the bad acting of Mr. Lee in Sir Lucius O'Trigger. Another\r\nactor, however, Mr. Clinch, was substituted in his place, and the play\r\nbeing lightened of this and some other incumbrances, rose at once into\r\nthat high region of public favor, where it has continued to float so\r\nbuoyantly and gracefully ever since.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from letters written at that time by Miss Linley\r\n(afterwards Mrs. Tickell) to her sister, Mrs. Sheridan, though\r\ncontaining nothing remarkable, yet, as warm with the feelings of a\r\nmoment so interesting in Sheridan's literary life, will be read,\r\nperhaps, with some degree of pleasure. The slightest outline of a\r\ncelebrated place, taken on the spot, has often a charm beyond the most\r\nelaborate picture finished at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Bath.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST ELIZA,\r\n\r\n\"We are all in the greatest anxiety about Sheridan's play,--though\r\nI do not think there is the least doubt of its succeeding. I was told\r\nlast night that it was his own story, and therefore called \"The Rivals;\"\r\nbut I do not give any credit to this intelligence....\r\n\r\n\"I am told he will get at least 700_l_. for his play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bath, January, 1775.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to tell you what pleasure we felt at the receipt of\r\nSheridan's last letter, which confirmed what we had seen in the\r\nnewspapers of the success of his play. The _knowing ones_ were very\r\nmuch disappointed, as they had so very bad an opinion of its success.\r\nAfter the first night we were indeed all very fearful that the audience\r\nwould go very much prejudiced against it. But now, there can be no doubt\r\nof its success, as it has certainly got through more difficulties than\r\nany comedy which has not met its doom the first night. I know you have\r\nbeen very busy in writing for Sheridan,--I don't mean _copying_,\r\nbut _composing_;--it's true, indeed;--you must not contradict me\r\nwhen I say you wrote the much admired epilogue to the Rivals. How I long\r\nto read it! What makes it more certain is, that my _father_ guessed\r\nit was _yours_ the first time he saw it praised in the paper.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement respecting the epilogue would, if true, deprive Sheridan\r\nof one of the fairest leaves of his poetic crown. It appears, however,\r\nto be but a conjecture hazarded at the moment, and proves only the high\r\nidea entertained of Mrs. Sheridan's talents by her own family. The cast\r\nof the play at Bath, and its success there and elsewhere, are thus\r\nmentioned in these letters of Miss Linley:\r\n\r\n\"Bath, February 18, 1775.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say of The Rivals!--a compliment must naturally be\r\nexpected; but really it goes so far beyond any thing I can say in its\r\npraise, that I am afraid my modesty must keep me silent. When you and I\r\nmeet I shall be better able to explain myself, and tell you how much I\r\nam delighted with it. We expect to have it _here_ very soon:--it is\r\nnow in rehearsal. You pretty well know the merits of our principal\r\nperformers:--I'll show you how it is cast.\r\n\r\nSir Anthony         _Mr. Edwin_.\r\nCaptain Absolute    _Mr. Didier_.\r\nFalkland            _Mr. Dimond_.\r\n  (A new actor of great merit, and a sweet figure.)\r\nSir Lucius          _Mr. Jackson_.\r\nAcres               _Mr. Keasberry_.\r\nFag                 _Mr. Brunsdon_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Malaprop       _Mrs. Wheeler_.\r\nMiss Lydia          _Miss Wheeler_.\r\n  (Literally, a very pretty romantic girl, of seventeen.)\r\nJulia               _Mrs. Didier_\r\nLucy                _Mrs. Brett_.\r\n\r\nThere, Madam, do not you think we shall do your Rivals some justice? I'm\r\nconvinced it won't be done better any where out of London. I don't think\r\nMrs. Mattocks can do Julia very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bath, March 9, 1775.\r\n\r\n\"You will know by what you see enclosed in this frank my reason for not\r\nanswering your letter sooner was, that I waited the success of\r\nSheridan's play in Bath; for, let me tell you, I look upon our\r\ntheatrical tribunal, though not in _quantity_, in _quality_ as\r\ngood as yours, and I do not believe there was a critic in the whole city\r\nthat was not there. But, in my life, I never saw any thing go off with\r\nsuch uncommon applause. I must first of all inform you that there was a\r\nvery full house:--the play was performed inimitably well; nor did I\r\nhear, for the honor of our Bath actors, one single prompt the whole\r\nnight; but I suppose the poor creatures never acted with such shouts of\r\napplause in their lives, so that they were incited by that to do their\r\nbest. They lost many of Malaprop's good sayings by the applause: in\r\nshort, I never saw or heard any thing like it;--before the actors spoke,\r\nthey began their clapping. There was a new scene of the N. Parade,\r\npainted by Mr. Davis, and a most delightful one it is, I assure you.\r\nEvery body says,--Bowers in particular,--that yours in town is not so\r\ngood. Most of the dresses were entirely new, and very handsome. On the\r\nwhole, I think Sheridan is vastly obliged to poor dear Keasberry for\r\ngetting it up so well. We only wanted a good Julia to have made it quite\r\ncomplete. You must know that it was entirely out of Mrs. Didier's style\r\nof playing: but I never saw better acting than Keasberry's,--so all the\r\ncritics agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bath, August 22d, 1775.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Sheridan his play has been acted at Southampton:--above a hundred\r\npeople were turned away the first night. They say there never was any\r\nthing so universally liked. They have very good success at Bristol, and\r\nhave played The Rivals several times:--Miss Barsanti, Lydia, and Mrs.\r\nCanning, Julia.\"\r\n\r\nTo enter into a regular analysis of this lively play, the best comment\r\non which is to be found in the many smiling faces that are lighted up\r\naround wherever it appears, is a task of criticism that will hardly be\r\nthought necessary. With much less wit, it exhibits perhaps more humor\r\nthan The School for Scandal, and the dialogue, though by no means so\r\npointed or sparkling, is, in this respect, more natural, as coming\r\nnearer the current coin of ordinary conversation; whereas, the\r\ncirculating medium of The School for Scandal is diamonds. The characters\r\nof The Rivals, on the contrary, are _not_ such as occur very\r\ncommonly in the world; and, instead of producing striking effects with\r\nnatural and obvious materials, which is the great art and difficulty of\r\na painter of human life, he has here overcharged most of his persons\r\nwith whims and absurdities, for which the circumstances they are engaged\r\nin afford but a very disproportionate vent. Accordingly, for our insight\r\ninto their characters, we are indebted rather to their confessions than\r\ntheir actions. Lydia Languish, in proclaiming the extravagance of her\r\nown romantic notions, prepares us for events much more ludicrous and\r\neccentric, than those in which the plot allows her to be concerned; and\r\nthe young lady herself is scarcely more disappointed than we are, at the\r\ntameness with which her amour concludes. Among the various ingredients\r\nsupposed to be mixed up in the composition of Sir Lucius O'Trigger, his\r\nlove of fighting is the only one whose flavor is very strongly brought\r\nout; and the wayward, captious jealousy of Falkland, though so highly\r\ncolored in his own representation of it, is productive of no incident\r\nanswerable to such an announcement:--the imposture which he practises\r\nupon Julia being perhaps weakened in its effect, by our recollection of\r\nthe same device in the Nut-brown Maid and Peregrine Pickle.\r\n\r\nThe character of Sir Anthony Absolute is, perhaps, the best sustained\r\nand most natural of any, and the scenes between him and Captain Absolute\r\nare richly, genuinely dramatic. His surprise at the apathy with which\r\nhis son receives the glowing picture which he draws of the charms of his\r\ndestined bride, and the effect of the question, \"And which is to be\r\nmine, Sir,--the niece or the aunt?\" are in the truest style of humor.\r\nMrs. Malaprop's mistakes, in what she herself calls \"orthodoxy,\" have\r\nbeen often objected to as improbable from a woman in her rank of life;\r\nbut, though some of them, it must be owned, are extravagant and\r\nfarcical, they are almost all amusing,--and the luckiness of her simile,\r\n\"as headstrong as an _allegory_ on the banks of the Nile,\" will be\r\nacknowledged as long as there are writers to be run away with, by the\r\nwilfulness of this truly \"headstrong\" species of composition.\r\n\r\nOf the faults of Sheridan both in his witty and serious styles--the\r\noccasional effort of the one, and the too frequent false finery of the\r\nother--some examples may be cited from the dialogue of this play. Among\r\nthe former kind is the following elaborate conceit:--\r\n\r\n\"_Falk._ Has Lydia changed her mind? I should have thought her duty\r\nand inclination would now have pointed to the same object.\r\n\r\n\"_Abs._ Ay, just as the eyes of a person who squints: when her\r\nlove-eye was fixed on me, t'other--her eye of duty--was finely obliqued:\r\nbut when duty bade her point that the same way, off turned t'other on a\r\nswivel, and secured its retreat with a frown.\"\r\n\r\nThis, though ingenious, is far too labored--and of that false taste by\r\nwhich sometimes, in his graver style, he was seduced into the display of\r\nsecond-rate ornament, the following speeches of Julia afford specimens:--\r\n\r\n\"Then on the bosom of your wedded Julia, you may lull your keen regret\r\nto slumbering; while virtuous love, with a cherub's hand, shall smooth\r\nthe brow of upbraiding thought, and pluck the thorn from compunction.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\"When hearts deserving happiness would unite their fortunes,\r\nvirtue would crown them with an unfading garland of modest hurtless\r\nflowers: but ill-judging passion will force the gaudier rose into the\r\nwreath, whose thorn offends them when its leaves are dropt.\"\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding such blemishes,--and it is easy for the microscopic\r\neye of criticism to discover gaps and inequalities in the finest edge of\r\ngenius,--this play, from the liveliness of its plot, the variety and\r\nwhimsicality of its characters, and the exquisite humor of its dialogue,\r\nis one of the most amusing in the whole range of the drama; and even\r\nwithout the aid of its more splendid successor, The School for Scandal,\r\nwould have placed Sheridan in the first rank of comic writers.\r\n\r\nA copy of The Rivals has fallen into my hands, which once belonged to\r\nTickell, the friend and brother-in-law of Sheridan, and on the margin of\r\nwhich I find written by him in many places his opinion of particular\r\nparts of the dialogue. [Footnote: These opinions are generally expressed\r\nin two or three words, and are, for the most part, judicious. Upon Mrs.\r\nMalaprop's quotation from Shakspeare, \"Hesperian curls,\" &c. he writes,\r\n\"overdone--fitter for farce than comedy.\" Acres's classification of\r\noaths, \"This we call the _oath referential,\"_ &c. he pronounces to\r\nbe \"very good, but above the speaker's capacity.\" Of Julia's speech, \"Oh\r\nwoman, how true should be your judgment, when your resolution is so\r\nweak!\" he remarks, \"On the contrary, it seems to be of little\r\nconsequence whether any person's judgment be weak or not, who wants\r\nresolution to act according to it.\"] He has also prefixed to it, as\r\ncoming from Sheridan, the following humorous dedication, which, I take\r\nfor granted, has never before met the light, and which the reader will\r\nperceive, by the allusions in it to the two Whig ministries, could not\r\nhave been written before the year 1784:--\r\n\r\n\"DEDICATION TO IDLENESS.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n\"If it were necessary to make any apology for this freedom, I know you\r\nwould think it a sufficient one, that I shall find it easier to dedicate\r\nmy play to you than to any other person. There is likewise a propriety\r\nin prefixing your name to a work begun entirely at your suggestion, and\r\nfinished under your auspices; and I should think myself wanting in\r\ngratitude to you, if I did not take an early opportunity of\r\nacknowledging the obligations which I owe you. There was a time--though\r\nit is so long ago that I now scarcely remember it, and cannot mention it\r\nwithout compunction--but there was a time, when the importunity of\r\nparents, and the example of a few injudicious young men of my\r\nacquaintance, had almost prevailed on me to thwart my genius, and\r\nprostitute my abilities by an application to serious pursuits. And if\r\nyou had not opened my eyes to the absurdity and profligacy of such a\r\nperversion of the best gifts of nature, I am by no means clear that I\r\nmight not have been a wealthy merchant or an eminent lawyer at this very\r\nmoment. Nor was it only on my first setting out in life that I availed\r\nmyself of a connection with you, though perhaps I never reaped such\r\nsignal advantages from it as at that critical period. I have frequently\r\nsince stood in need of your admonitions, and have always found you ready\r\nto assist me--though you were frequently brought by your zeal for me\r\ninto new and awkward situations, and such as you were at first,\r\nnaturally enough, unwilling to appear in. Amongst innumerable other\r\ninstances, I cannot omit two, where you afforded me considerable and\r\nunexpected relief, and in fact converted employments, usually attended\r\nby dry and disgusting business, into scenes of perpetual merriment and\r\nrecreation. I allude, as you will easily imagine, to those cheerful\r\nhours which I spent in the Secretary of State's office and the Treasury,\r\nduring all which time you were my inseparable companion, and showed me\r\nsuch a preference over the rest of my colleagues, as excited at once\r\ntheir envy and admiration. Indeed, it was very natural for them to\r\nrepine at your having taught me a way of doing business, which it was\r\nimpossible for them to follow--it was both original and inimitable.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to say here all that I think of your excellencies, I might be\r\nsuspected of flattery; but I beg leave to refer you for the test of my\r\nsincerity to the constant tenor of my life and actions; and shall\r\nconclude with a sentiment of which no one can dispute the truth, nor\r\nmistake the application,--that those persons usually deserve most of\r\ntheir friends who expect least of them.\r\n\r\n\"I am, &c. &c. &c.,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrity which Sheridan had acquired, as the chivalrous lover of\r\nMiss Linley, was of course considerably increased by the success of The\r\nRivals; and, gifted as he and his beautiful wife were with all that\r\nforms the magnetism of society,--the power to attract, and the\r\ndisposition to be attracted,--their life, as may easily be supposed, was\r\none of gaiety both at home and abroad. Though little able to cope with\r\nthe entertainments of their wealthy acquaintance, her music and the good\r\ncompany which his talents drew around him, were an ample repayment for\r\nthe more solid hospitalities which they received. Among the families\r\nvisited by them was that of Mr. Coote (Purden), at whose musical parties\r\nMrs. Sheridan frequently sung, accompanied occasionally by the two\r\nlittle daughters [Footnote: The charm of her singing, as well as her\r\nfondness for children, are interestingly described in a letter to my\r\nfriend Mr. Rogers, from one of the most tasteful writers of the present\r\nday:--\"Hers was truly 'a voice as of the cherub choir,' and she was\r\nalways ready to sing without any pressing. She sung here a great deal,\r\nand to my infinite delight; but what had a particular charm was, that\r\nshe used to take my daughter, then a child, on her lap, and sing a\r\nnumber of childish songs with such a playfulness of manner, and such a\r\nsweetness of look and voice, as was quite enchanting.\"] of Mr. Coote,\r\nwho were the originals of the children introduced into Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds's portrait of Mrs. Sheridan as St. Cecilia. It was here that\r\nthe Duchess of Devonshire first met Sheridan; and, as I have been told,\r\nlong hesitated as to the propriety of inviting to her house two persons\r\nof such equivocal rank in society, as he and his wife were at that time\r\nconsidered. Her Grace was reminded of these scruples some years after,\r\nwhen \"the player's son\" had become the admiration of the proudest and\r\nfairest; and when a house, provided for the Duchess herself at Bath, was\r\nleft two months unoccupied, in consequence of the social attractions of\r\nSheridan, which prevented a party then assembled at Chatsworth from\r\nseparating. These are triumphs which, for the sake of all humbly born\r\nheirs of genius, deserve to be commemorated.\r\n\r\nIn gratitude, it is said, to Clinch, the actor, for the seasonable\r\nreinforcement which he had brought to The Rivals, Mr. Sheridan produced\r\nthis year a farce called \"St. Patrick's Day, or the Scheming\r\nLieutenant,\" which was acted on the 2d of May, and had considerable\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThough we must not look for the usual point of Sheridan in this piece,\r\nwhere the hits of pleasantry are performed with the broad end or\r\n_mace_ of his wit, there is yet a quick circulation of humor\r\nthrough the dialogue,--and laughter, the great end of farce, is\r\nabundantly achieved by it. The moralizing of Doctor Rosy, and the\r\ndispute between the justice's wife and her daughter, as to the\r\nrespective merits of militia-men and regulars, are highly comic:--\r\n\r\n\"Psha, you know, Mamma, I hate militia officers; a set of dunghill cocks\r\nwith spurs on--heroes scratched off a church door. No, give me the bold\r\nupright youth, who makes love to-day, and has his head shot off to-\r\nmorrow. Dear! to think how the sweet fellows sleep on the ground, and\r\nfight in silk stockings and lace ruffles.\r\n\r\n\"_Mother._ Oh barbarous! to want a husband that may wed you to-day\r\nand be sent the Lord knows where before night; then in a twelve-month,\r\nperhaps, to have him come like a Colossus, with one leg at New York and\r\nthe other at Chelsea Hospital.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, there occurs a phrase or sentence, which might be sworn\r\nto, as from the pen of Sheridan, any where. Thus, in the very opening:--\r\n\r\n\"_1st Soldier._ I say you are wrong; we should all speak together,\r\neach for himself, and all at once, that we may be heard the better.\r\n\r\n\"_2d Soldier._ Right, Jack, we'll _argue in platoons_.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great success of his first attempts in the drama, we\r\nfind politics this year renewing its claims upon his attention, and\r\ntempting him to enter into the lists with no less an antagonist than Dr.\r\nJohnson. That eminent man had just published his pamphlet on the\r\nAmerican question, entitled \"Taxation no Tyranny;\"--a work whose pompous\r\nsarcasms on the Congress of Philadelphia, when compared with what has\r\nhappened since, dwindle into puerilities, and show what straws upon the\r\ngreat tide of events are even the mightiest intellects of this world.\r\nSome notes and fragments, found among the papers of Mr. Sheridan, prove\r\nthat he had it in contemplation to answer this pamphlet; and, however\r\ninferior he might have been in style to his practised adversary, he\r\nwould at least have had the advantage of a good cause, and of those\r\ndurable materials of truth and justice, which outlive the mere\r\nworkmanship, however splendid, of talent. Such arguments as the\r\nfollowing, which Johnson did not scruple to use, are, by the haughtiness\r\nof their tone and thought, only fit for the lips of autocrats:--\r\n\r\n\"When they apply to our compassion, by telling us that they are to be\r\ncarried from their own country to be tried for certain offences, we are\r\nnot so ready to pity them, as to advise them not to offend. While they\r\nare innocent, they are safe.\r\n\r\n\"If they are condemned unheard, it is because there is no need of a\r\ntrial. The crime is manifest and notorious,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the fragments of the projected answer, that Johnson's\r\npension was one of the points upon which Mr. Sheridan intended to assail\r\nhim. The prospect of being able to neutralize the effects of his zeal,\r\nby exposing the nature of the chief incentive from which it sprung, was\r\nso tempting, perhaps, as to overrule any feelings of delicacy, that\r\nmight otherwise have suggested the illiberality of such an attack. The\r\nfollowing are a few of the stray hints for this part of his subject:--\r\n\r\n\"It is hard when a learned man thinks himself obliged to commence\r\npolitician.--Such pamphlets will be as trifling and insincere as the\r\nvenal quit-rent of a birth-day ode. [Footnote: On another scrap of paper\r\nI find \"the miserable quit-rent of an annual pamphlet.\" It was his\r\ncustom in composition (as will be seen by many other instances) thus to\r\ntry the same thought in a variety of forms and combinations, in order to\r\nsee in which it would yield the greatest produce of wit.]\r\n\r\n\"Dr. J.'s other works, his learning and infirmities, fully entitled him\r\nto such a mark of distinction.--There was no call on him to become\r\npolitician,--the easy quit-rent of refined panegyric, and a few grateful\r\nrhymes or flowery dedications to the intermediate benefactor....\r\n\r\n\"The man of letters is rarely drawn from obscurity by the inquisitive\r\neye of a sovereign:--it is enough for Royalty to gild the laurelled\r\nbrow, not explore the garret or the cellar.--In this case, the return\r\nwill generally be ungrateful--the patron is most possibly disgraced or\r\nin opposition--if he (the author) follows the dictates of gratitude, he\r\nmust speak his patron's language, but he may lose his pension--but to be\r\na standing supporter of ministry, is probably to take advantage of that\r\ncompetence against his benefactor.--When it happens that there is great\r\nexperience and political knowledge, this is more excusable; but it is\r\ntruly unfortunate where the fame of far different abilities adds weight\r\nto the attempts of rashness....\"\r\n\r\nHe then adds this very striking remark: \"Men seldom think deeply on\r\nsubjects on which they have no choice of opinion:--they are fearful of\r\nencountering obstacles to their faith (as in religion), and so are\r\ncontent with the surface.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson says, in one part of his pamphlet,--\"As all are born the\r\nsubjects of some state or other, we may be said to have been all born\r\nconsenting to some system of government.\" On this Sheridan remarks:--\r\n\"This is the most slavish doctrine that ever was inculcated. If by our\r\nbirth we give a tacit bond for our acquiescence in that form of\r\ngovernment under which we were born, there never would have been an\r\nalteration of the first modes of government--no Revolution in England.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the argument derived from the right of conquest he observes--\"This\r\nis the worst doctrine that can be with respect to America.--If America\r\nis ours by conquest, it is the conquerors who settled there that are to\r\nclaim these powers.\"\r\n\r\nHe expresses strong indignation at the \"arrogance\" with which such a man\r\nas Montesquieu is described as \"the fanciful Montesquieu,\" by \"an\r\neleemosynary politician, who writes on the subject merely because he has\r\nbeen rewarded for writing otherwise all his lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the argument against the claims of the Americans, founded\r\non the small proportion of the population that is really represented\r\neven in England, he has the following desultory memorandums:--\"In fact,\r\nevery man in England is represented--every man can influence people,\r\nso as to get a vote, and even if in an election votes are divided, each\r\ncandidate is supposed equally worthy--as in lots--fight Ajax or\r\nAgamemnon. [Footnote: He means to compare an election of this sort to\r\nthe casting of lots between the Grecian chiefs in the 7th book of the\r\nIliad.]--This an American cannot do in any way whatever.\r\n\r\n\"The votes in England are perpetually shifting:--were it an object, few\r\ncould be excluded.--Wherever there is any one ambitious of assisting the\r\nempire, he need not put himself to much inconvenience.--If the Doctor\r\nindulged his studies in Cricklade or Old Sarum, he might vote:--the\r\ndressing meat, the simplest proof of existence, begets a title.--His\r\npamphlet shows that he thinks he can influence some one: not an\r\nanonymous writer in the paper but contributes his mite to the general\r\ntenor of opinion.--At the eve of an election, his Patriot [Footnote: The\r\nname of a short pamphlet, published by Dr. Johnson, on the dissolution\r\nof Parliament in 1774.] was meant to influence more than the single\r\nvoice of a rustic.--Even the mob, in shouting, give votes where there is\r\nnot corruption.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be regretted that this pamphlet was left unfinished. Men of\r\na high order of genius, such as Johnson and Sheridan, should never enter\r\ninto warfare with each other, but, like the gods in Homer, leave the\r\nstrife to inferior spirits. The publication of this pamphlet would most\r\nprobably have precluded its author from the distinction and pleasure\r\nwhich he afterwards enjoyed in the society and conversation of the\r\neloquent moralist, who, in the following year, proposed him as a member\r\nof the Literary Club, and always spoke of his character and genius with\r\npraise. Nor was Sheridan wanting on his part with corresponding\r\ntributes; for, in a prologue which he wrote about this time to the play\r\nof Sir Thomas Overbury, he thus alludes to Johnson's Life of its\r\nunfortunate author:--\r\n\r\n  \"So pleads the tale, that gives to future times\r\n  The son's misfortunes, and the parent's crimes;\r\n  There shall his fame, if own'd to-night, survive;\r\n  Fix'd by the hand that bids our language live.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA.--PURCHASE OF DRURY LANE THEATRE.--THE TRIP TO SCARBOROUGH.--\r\nPOETICAL CORRESPONDENCE WITH MRS. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan had now got into a current of dramatic fancy, of whose\r\nprosperous flow he continued to avail himself actively. The summer\r\nrecess was employed in writing the Duenna; and his father-in-law, Mr.\r\nLinley, assisted in selecting and composing the music for it. As every\r\nthing connected with the progress of a work, which is destined to be\r\nlong the delight of English ears, must naturally have a charm for\r\nEnglish readers, I feel happy at being enabled to give, from letters\r\nwritten at the time by Mr. Sheridan himself to Mr. Linley, some details\r\nrelating to their joint adaptation of the music, which, judging from my\r\nown feelings, I cannot doubt will be interesting to others.\r\n\r\nMr. Linley was at this time at Bath, and the following letter to him is\r\ndated in October, 1775, about a month or five weeks before the opera was\r\nbrought out:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"We received your songs to-day, with which we are exceedingly pleased. I\r\nshall profit by your proposed alterations; but I'd have you to know that\r\nwe are much too chaste in London to admit such strains as your Bath\r\nspring inspires. We dare not propose a peep beyond the ankle on any\r\naccount; for the critics in the pit at a new play are much greater\r\nprudes than the ladies in the boxes. Betsey intended to have troubled\r\nyou with some music for correction, and I with some stanzas, but an\r\ninterview with Harris to-day has put me from the thoughts of it, and\r\nbent me upon a much more important petition. You may easily suppose it\r\nis nothing else than what I said I would not ask in my last. But, in\r\nshort, unless you can give us three days in town, I fear our opera will\r\nstand a chance to be ruined. Harris is extravagantly sanguine of its\r\nsuccess as to plot and dialogue, which is to be rehearsed next Wednesday\r\nat the theatre. They will exert themselves to the utmost in the scenery,\r\n&c., but I never saw any one so disconcerted as he was at the idea of\r\nthere being no one to put them in the right way as to music. They have\r\nno one there whom he has any opinion of--as to Fisher (one of the\r\nmanagers), he don't choose he should meddle with it. He entreated me in\r\nthe most pressing terms to write instantly to you, and wanted, if he\r\nthought it could be any weight, to write himself.\r\n\r\n\"Is it impossible to contrive this? couldn't you leave Tom [Footnote:\r\nMrs. Sheridan's eldest brother] to superintend the concert for a few\r\ndays? If you can manage it, you will really do me the greatest service\r\nin the world. As to the state of the music, I want but three more airs,\r\nbut there are some glees and quintets in the last act, that will be\r\ninevitably ruined, if we have no one to set the performers at least in\r\nthe right way. Harris has set his heart so much on my succeeding in this\r\napplication, that he still flatters himself we may have a rehearsal of\r\nthe music in Orchard Street to-morrow se'nnight. Every hour's delay is a\r\nmaterial injury both to the opera and the theatre, so that if you can\r\ncome and relieve us from this perplexity, the return of the post must\r\nonly forerun your arrival; or (what will make us much happier) might it\r\nnot bring _you_? I shall say nothing at present about the lady\r\n'with the soft look and manner,' because I am full of more than hopes of\r\nseeing you. For the same reason I shall delay to speak about G---;\r\n[Footnote: Garrick] only this much I will say, that I am more than ever\r\npositive I could make good my part of the matter; but that I still\r\nremain an infidel as to G.'s retiring, or parting with his share, though\r\nI confess he _seems_ to come closer to the point in naming his\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\"Your ever sincere and affectionate,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nOn the opposite leaf of this letter is written, in Mrs. S.'s\r\nhandwriting,--\"Dearest Father, I shall have no spirits or hopes of the\r\nopera, unless we see you.\r\n\r\n\"ELIZA ANN SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to these pressing demands, Mr. Linley, as appears by the\r\nfollowing letter, signified his intention of being in town as soon as\r\nthe music should be put in rehearsal. In the instructions here given by\r\nthe poet to the musician, we may perceive that he somewhat apprehended,\r\neven in the tasteful hands of Mr. Linley, that predominance of harmony\r\nover melody, and of noise over both, which is so fatal to poetry and\r\nsong, in their perilous alliance with an orchestra. Indeed, those\r\nelephants of old, that used to tread down the ranks they were brought to\r\nassist, were but a type of the havoc that is sometimes made both of\r\nmelody and meaning by the overlaying aid of accompaniments.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Harris wishes so much for us to get you to town, that I could not\r\nat first convince him that your proposal of not coming till the music\r\nwas in rehearsal, was certainly the best, as you could stay but so short\r\na time. The truth is, that what you mention of my getting a\r\n_master_ to teach the performers is the very point where the matter\r\nsticks, there being no such person as a master among them. Harris is\r\nsensible there ought to be such a person; however, at present, every\r\nbody sings there according to their own ideas, or what chance\r\ninstruction they can come at. We are, however, to follow your plan in\r\nthe matter; but can at no rate relinquish the hopes of seeing you in\r\neight or ten days from the date of this; when the music (by the specimen\r\nof expedition you have given me) will be advanced as far as you mention.\r\nThe parts are all writ out and doubled, &c. as we go on, as I have\r\nassistance from the theatre with me.\r\n\r\n\"My intention was, to have closed the first act with a song, but I find\r\nit is not thought so well. Hence I trust you with one of the inclosed\r\npapers; and, at the same time, you must excuse my impertinence in adding\r\nan idea of the cast I would wish the music to have; as I think I have\r\nheard you say you never heard Leoni, [Footnote: Leoni played Don\r\nCarlos.] and I cannot briefly explain to you the character and situation\r\nof the persons on the stage with him. The first (a dialogue between\r\nQuick and Mrs. Mattocks [Footnote: Isaac and Donna Louisa.]), I would\r\nwish to be a pert, sprightly air; for, though some of the words mayn't\r\nseem suited to it, I should mention that they are neither of them in\r\nearnest in what they say. Leoni takes it up seriously, and I want him to\r\nshow himself advantageously in the six lines beginning 'Gentle maid.' I\r\nshould tell you, that he sings nothing well but in a plaintive or\r\npastoral style; and his voice is such as appears to me always to be hurt\r\nby much accompaniment. I have observed, too, that he never gets so much\r\napplause as when he makes a cadence. Therefore my idea is, that he\r\nshould make a flourish at 'Shall I grieve thee?' and return to 'Gentle\r\nmaid,' and so sing that part of the tune again. [Footnote: It will be\r\nperceived, by a reference to the music of the opera, that Mr. Linley\r\nfollowed these instructions implicitly and successfully.] After that,\r\nthe two last lines, sung by the three, with the persons only varied, may\r\nget them off with as much spirit as possible. The second act ends with a\r\n_slow_ glee, therefore I should think the two last lines in\r\nquestion had better be brisk, especially as Quick and Mrs. Mattocks are\r\nconcerned in it.\r\n\r\n\"The other is a song of Wilson's in the third act. I have written it to\r\nyour tune, which you put some words to, beginning, 'Prithee, prithee,\r\npretty man!' I think it will do vastly well for the words: Don Jerome\r\nsings them when he is in particular spirits; therefore the tune is not\r\ntoo light, though it might seem so by the last stanza--but he does not\r\nmean to be grave there, and I like particularly the returning to 'O the\r\ndays when I was young!' We have mislaid the notes, but Tom remembers it.\r\nIf you don't like it for words, will you give us one? but it must go\r\nback to 'O the days,' and be _funny_. I have not done troubling you\r\nyet, but must wait till Monday.\"\r\n\r\nA subsequent letter contains further particulars of their progress.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Sunday evening next is fixed for our first musical rehearsal, and I was\r\nin great hopes we might have completed the score. The songs you have\r\nsent up of 'Banna's Banks,' and 'Deil take the wars,' I had made words\r\nfor before they arrived, which answer excessively well; and this was my\r\nreason for wishing for the next in the same manner, as it saved so much\r\ntime. They are to sing 'Wind, gentle evergreen,' just as you sing it\r\n(only with other words), and I wanted only such support from the\r\ninstruments, or such joining in, as you should think would help to set\r\noff and assist the effort. I inclose the words I had made for 'Wind,\r\ngentle evergreen,' which will be sung, as a catch, by Mrs. Mattocks,\r\nDubellamy, [Footnote: Don Antonio.] and Leoni. I don't mind the words\r\nnot fitting the notes so well as the original ones. 'How merrily we\r\nlive,' and 'Let's drink and let's sing,' are to be sung by a company of\r\n_friars_ over their wine. [Footnote: For these was afterwards\r\nsubstituted Mr. Linley's lively glee, \"This bottle's the sun of our\r\ntable.\"] The words will be parodied, and the chief effect I expect from\r\nthem must arise from their being _known_; for the joke will be much\r\nless for these jolly fathers to sing any thing new, than to give what\r\nthe audience are used to annex the idea of jollity to. For the other\r\nthings Betsey mentioned, I only wish to have them with such\r\naccompaniment as you would put to their _present_ words, and I\r\nshall have got words to my liking for them by the time they reach me.\r\n\r\n\"My immediate wish at present is to give the performers their parts in\r\nthe music (which they expect on Sunday night), and for any assistance\r\nthe orchestra can give to help the effect of the glees, &c., that may be\r\njudged of and added at a rehearsal, or, as you say, on inquiring how\r\nthey have been done; though I don't think it follows that what Dr.\r\nArne's method is must be the best. If it were possible for Saturday and\r\nSunday's post to bring us what we asked for in our last letters, and\r\nwhat I now enclose, we should still go through it on Sunday, and the\r\nperformers should have their parts complete by Monday night. We have had\r\nour rehearsal of the speaking part, and are to have another on Saturday.\r\nI want Dr. Harrington's catch, but, as the sense must be the same, I am\r\nat a loss how to put other words. Can't the under part ('A smoky house,\r\n&c.') be sung by one person and the other two change? The situation is--\r\nQuick and Dubellamy, two lovers, carrying away Father Paul (Reinold) in\r\ngreat raptures, to marry them:--the Friar has before warned them of the\r\nills of a married life, and they break out into this. The catch is\r\nparticularly calculated for a stage effect; but I don't like to take\r\nanother person's words, and I don't see how I can put others, keeping\r\nthe same idea ('of seven squalling brats, &c.') in which the whole\r\naffair lies. However, I shall be glad of the notes, with Reynold's part,\r\nif it is possible, as I mentioned. [Footnote: This idea was afterwards\r\nrelinquished.]\r\n\r\n\"I have literally and really not had time to write the words of any\r\nthing more first and then send them to you, and this obliges me to use\r\nthis apparently awkward way....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"My father was astonishingly well received on Saturday night in Cato: I\r\nthink it will not be many days before we are reconciled.\r\n\r\n\"The inclosed are the words for 'Wind, gentle evergreen;' a passionate\r\nsong for Mattocks, [Footnote: The words of this song, in composing which\r\nthe directions here given were exactly followed, are to be found in\r\nscarce any of the editions of the Duenna. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Sharp is the woe that wounds the jealous mind,\r\n    When treachery two fond hearts would rend;\r\n  But oh! how keener far the pang to find\r\n    That traitor in our bosom friend.]\r\n\r\nand another for Miss Brown, [Footnote: \"Adieu, thou dreary pile.\"] which\r\nsolicit to be clothed with melody by you, and are all I want. Mattocks's\r\nI could wish to be a broken, passionate affair, and the first two lines\r\nmay be recitative, or what you please, uncommon. Miss Brown sings hers\r\nin a joyful mood: we want her to show in it as much execution as she is\r\ncapable of, which is pretty well; and, for variety, we want Mr.\r\nSimpson's hautboy to cut a figure, with replying passages, &c., in the\r\nway of Fisher's '_M' ami, il bel idol mio_,' to abet which I have\r\nlugged in 'Echo,' who is always allowed to play her part. I have not a\r\nmoment more. Yours ever sincerely.\"\r\n\r\nThe next and last extract I shall give at present is from a letter,\r\ndated Nov. 2, 1775, about three weeks before the first representation of\r\nthe opera.\r\n\r\n\"Our music is now all finished and rehearsing, but we are greatly\r\nimpatient to see _you_. We hold your coming to be _necessary_\r\nbeyond conception. You say you are at our service after Tuesday next;\r\nthen 'I conjure you by that you do possess,' in which I include all the\r\npowers that preside over harmony, to come next Thursday night (this day\r\nse'nnight), and we will fix a rehearsal for Friday morning. From what I\r\nsee of their rehearsing at present, I am become still more anxious to\r\nsee you.\r\n\r\n\"We have received all your songs, and are vastly pleased with them. You\r\nmisunderstood me as to the hautboy song; I had not the least intention\r\nto fix on '_Bel idol mio_,' However, I think it is particularly\r\nwell adapted, and, I doubt not, will have a great effect....\"\r\n\r\nAn allusion which occurs in these letters to the prospect of a\r\nreconciliation with his father gives me an opportunity of mentioning a\r\ncircumstance, connected with their difference, for the knowledge of\r\nwhich I am indebted to one of the persons most interested in remembering\r\nit, and which, as a proof of the natural tendency of Sheridan's heart to\r\nlet all its sensibilities flow in the right channel, ought not to be\r\nforgotten. During the run of one of his pieces, having received\r\ninformation from an old family servant that his father (who still\r\nrefused to have any intercourse with him) meant to attend, with his\r\ndaughters, at the representation of the piece, Sheridan took up his\r\nstation by one of the side scenes, opposite to the box where they sat,\r\nand there continued, unobserved, to look at them during the greater part\r\nof the night. On his return home, he was so affected by the various\r\nrecollections that came upon him, that he burst into tears, and, being\r\nquestioned as to the cause of his agitation by Mrs. Sheridan, to whom it\r\nwas new to see him returning thus saddened from the scene of his\r\ntriumph, he owned how deeply it had gone to his heart \"to think that\r\n_there_ sat his father and his sisters before him, and yet that he\r\nalone was not permitted to go near them or speak to them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, 1775, The Duenna was performed at Covent\r\nGarden, and the following is the original cast of the characters, as\r\ngiven in the collection of Mr. Sheridan's Dramatic Works:--\r\n\r\nDon Ferdinand         _Mr. Mattocks_.\r\nIsaac Mendoza         _Mr. Quick_.\r\nDon Jerome            _Mr. Wilson_.\r\nDon Antonio           _Mr. Dubellamy_.\r\nFather Paul           _Mr. Watson_.\r\nLopez                 _Mr. Wewitzer_.\r\nDon Carlos            _Mr. Leoni_.\r\nFrancis               _Mr. Fox_.\r\nLay Brother           _Mr. Baker_.\r\n\r\nDonna Louisa          _Mrs. Mattocks_.\r\nDonna Clara           _Mrs. Cargill_. [Footnote: This is incorrect:\r\nit was Miss Brown that played Donna Clara for the first few nights.]\r\nThe Duenna            _Mrs. Green_.\r\n\r\nThe run of this opera has, I believe, no parallel in the annals of the\r\ndrama. Sixty-three nights was the career of the Beggar's Opera; but the\r\nDuenna was acted no less than seventy-five times during the season, the\r\nonly intermissions being a few days at Christmas, and the Fridays in\r\nevery week;--the latter on account of Leoni, who, being a Jew, could not\r\nact on those nights.\r\n\r\nIn order to counteract this great success of the rival house, Garrick\r\nfound it necessary to bring forward all the weight of his own best\r\ncharacters; and even had recourse to the expedient of playing off the\r\nmother against the son, by reviving Mrs. Frances Sheridan's comedy of\r\nThe Discovery, and acting the principal part in it himself. In allusion\r\nto the increased fatigue which this competition with The Duenna brought\r\nupon Garrick, who was then entering on his sixtieth year, it was said,\r\nby an actor of the day, that \"the old woman would be the death of the\r\nold man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duenna is one of the very few operas in our language, which combine\r\nthe merits of legitimate comedy with the attractions of poetry and\r\nsong;--that divorce between sense and sound, to which Dr. Brown and\r\nothers trace the cessation of the early miracles of music, being no\r\nwhere more remarkable than in the operas of the English stage. The\r\n\"Sovereign of the willing soul\" (as Gray calls Music) always loses by\r\nbeing made exclusive sovereign,--and the division of her empire with\r\npoetry and wit, as in the instance of The Duenna, doubles her real\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe intrigue of this piece (which is mainly founded upon an incident\r\nborrowed from the \"Country Wife\" of Wycherley) is constructed and\r\nmanaged with considerable adroitness, having just material enough to be\r\nwound out into three acts, without being encumbered by too much\r\nintricacy, or weakened by too much extension. It does not appear, from\r\nthe rough copy in my possession, that any material change was made in\r\nthe plan of the work, as it proceeded. Carlos was originally meant to be\r\na Jew, and is called \"Cousin Moses\" by Isaac, in the first sketch of the\r\ndialogue; but possibly from the consideration that this would apply too\r\npersonally to Leoni, who was to perform the character, its designation\r\nwas altered. The scene in the second act, where Carlos is introduced by\r\nIsaac to the Duenna, stood, in its original state, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Moses, sweet coz, I thrive, I prosper.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Where is your mistress?\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ There, you booby, there she stands.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Why she's damn'd ugly.\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Hush! (_stops his mouth_.)\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ What is your friend saying, Don?\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Oh, Ma'am, he's expressing his raptures at such charms as\r\nhe never saw before.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Ay, such as I never saw before indeed. (_aside_.)\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ You are very obliging, gentlemen; but, I dare say, Sir,\r\nyour friend is no stranger to the influence of beauty. I doubt not but\r\nhe is a lover himself.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Alas! Madam, there is now but one woman living, whom I\r\nhave any love for, and truly, Ma'am, you resemble her wonderfully.\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ Well, Sir, I wish she may give you her hand as speedily\r\nas I shall mine to your friend.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Me her hand!--O Lord, Ma'am--she is the last woman in the\r\nworld I could think of marrying.\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ What then, Sir, are you comparing me to some wanton--\r\nsome courtezan?\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Zounds! he durstn't.\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ O not I, upon my soul.\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ Yes, he meant some young harlot--some--\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Oh, dear Madam, no--it was my mother I meant, as I hope\r\nto be saved.\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Oh the blundering villain! (_aside_.)\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ How, Sir--am I so like your mother?\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Stay, dear Madam--my friend meant--that you put him in\r\nmind of what his mother was when a girl--didn't you, Moses?\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Oh yes, Madam, my mother was formerly a great beauty, a\r\ngreat toast, I assure you;--and when she married my father about thirty\r\nyears ago, as you may perhaps remember, Ma'am--\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ _I_, Sir! I remember thirty years ago!\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Oh, to be sure not, Ma'am--thirty years! no, no--it was\r\nthirty months he said, Ma'am--wasn't it, Moses?\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ Yes, yes, Ma'am--thirty months ago, on her marriage with\r\nmy father, she was, as I was saying, a great beauty;--but catching cold,\r\nthe year afterwards, in child-bed of your humble servant--\r\n\r\n\"_Duenna._ Of you, Sir!--and married within these thirty months!\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Oh the devil! he has made himself out but a year old!--\r\nCome, Moses, hold your tongue.--You must excuse him, Ma'am--he means to\r\nbe civil--but he is a poor, simple fellow--an't you, Moses?\r\n\r\n\"_Moses._ 'Tis true, indeed, Ma'am,\" &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the humor of Moses here was afterwards transferred\r\nto the character of Isaac, and it will be perceived that a few of the\r\npoints are still retained by him.\r\n\r\nThe wit of the dialogue, except in one or two instances, is of that\r\naccessible kind which lies near the surface--which may be enjoyed\r\nwithout wonder, and rather plays than shines. He had not yet searched\r\nhis fancy for those curious fossils of thought which make The School for\r\nScandal such a rich museum of wit. Of this precious kind, however, is\r\nthe description of Isaac's neutrality in religion--\"like the blank leaf\r\nbetween the Old and New Testament.\" As an instance, too, of the\r\noccasional abuse of this research, which led him to mistake labored\r\nconceits for fancies, may be mentioned the far-fetched comparison of\r\nserenaders to Egyptian embalmers, \"extracting the brain through the\r\nears.\" For this, however, his taste, not his invention, is responsible,\r\nas we have already seen that the thought was borrowed from a letter of\r\nhis friend Halhed.\r\n\r\nIn the speech of Lopez, the servant, with which the opera opens, there\r\nare, in the original copy, some humorous points, which appear to have\r\nfallen under the pruning knife, but which are not unworthy of being\r\ngathered up here:--\r\n\r\n\"A plague on these haughty damsels, say I:--when they play their airs on\r\ntheir whining gallants, they ought to consider that we are the chief\r\nsufferers,--we have all their ill-humors at second-hand. Donna Louisa's\r\ncruelty to my master usually converts itself into blows, by the time it\r\ngets to me:--she can frown me black and blue at any time, and I shall\r\ncarry the marks of the last box on the ear she gave him to my grave.\r\nNay, if she smiles on any one else, I am the sufferer for it:--if she\r\nsays a civil word to a rival, I am a rogue and a scoundrel; and, if she\r\nsends him a letter, my back is sure to pay the postage.\"\r\n\r\nIn the scene between Ferdinand and Jerome (act ii. scene 3) the\r\nfollowing lively speech of the latter was, I know not why, left out:--\r\n\r\n\"_Ferdin._ ....but he has never sullied his honor, which, with his\r\ntitle, has outlived his means.\r\n\r\n\"_Jerome._ Have they? More shame for them!--What business have\r\nhonor or titles to survive, when property is extinct? Nobility is but as\r\na helpmate to a good fortune, and, like a Japanese wife, should perish\r\non the funeral pile of the estate!\"\r\n\r\nIn the first act, too, (scene 3) where Jerome abuses the Duenna, there\r\nis an equally unaccountable omission of a sentence, in which he compares\r\nthe old lady's face to \"parchment, on which Time and Deformity have\r\nengrossed their titles.\"\r\n\r\nThough some of the poetry of this opera is not much above that ordinary\r\nkind, to which music is so often doomed to be wedded--making up by her\r\nown sweetness for the dulness of her help-mate--by far the greater\r\nnumber of the songs are full of beauty, and some of them may rank among\r\nthe best models of lyric writing. The verses, \"Had I a heart for\r\nfalsehood framed,\" notwithstanding the stiffness of this word \"framed,\"\r\nand one or two other slight blemishes, are not unworthy of living in\r\nrecollection with the matchless air to which they are adapted.\r\n\r\nThere is another song, less known, from being connected with less\r\npopular music, which, for deep, impassioned feeling and natural\r\neloquence, has not, perhaps, its rival, through the whole range of lyric\r\npoetry. As these verses, though contained in the common editions of The\r\nDuenna, are not to be found in the opera, as printed in the British\r\nTheatre, and, still more strangely, are omitted in the late Collection\r\nof Mr. Sheridan's Works, [Footnote: For this Edition of his Works I am\r\nno further responsible than in having communicated to it a few\r\nprefatory pages, to account and apologize to the public for the delay of\r\nthe Life.] I should feel myself abundantly authorized in citing them\r\nhere, even if their beauty were not a sufficient excuse for recalling\r\nthem, under any circumstances, to the recollection of the reader:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, cruel maid, how hast thou changed\r\n    The temper of my mind!\r\n  My heart, by thee from love estrang'd,\r\n    Becomes, like thee, unkind.\r\n\r\n  \"By fortune favor'd, clear in fame,\r\n    I once ambitious was;\r\n  And friends I had who fann'd the flame,\r\n    And gave my youth applause.\r\n\r\n  \"But now my weakness all accuse,\r\n    Yet vain their taunts on me;\r\n  Friends, fortune, fame itself I'd lose,\r\n    To gain one smile from thee.\r\n\r\n  \"And only thou should'st not despise\r\n    My weakness or my woe;\r\n  If I am mad in others' eyes,\r\n    'Tis thou hast made me so.\r\n\r\n  \"But days, like this, with doubting curst,\r\n    I will not long endure--\r\n  Am I disdain'd--I know the worst,\r\n    And likewise know my cure.\r\n\r\n  \"If, false, her vow she dare renounce,\r\n    That instant ends my pain;\r\n  For, oh! the heart must break at once,\r\n    That cannot hate again.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that such verses as these had no deeper\r\ninspiration than the imaginary loves of an opera. They bear, burnt into\r\nevery line, the marks of personal feeling, and must have been thrown off\r\nin one of those passionate moods of the heart, with which the poet's own\r\nyouthful love had made him acquainted, and under the impression or vivid\r\nrecollection of which these lines were written.\r\n\r\nIn comparing this poem with the original words of the air to which it is\r\nadapted, (Parnell's pretty lines, \"My days have been so wondrous free,\")\r\nit will be felt, at once, how wide is the difference between the cold\r\nand graceful effusions of taste, and the fervid bursts of real genius--\r\nbetween the delicate product of the conservatory, and the rich child of\r\nthe sunshine.\r\n\r\nI am the more confirmed in the idea that this song was written\r\npreviously to the opera, and from personal feeling, by finding among his\r\nearlier pieces the originals of two other songs--\"I ne'er could any\r\nlustre see,\" and \"What bard, oh Time, discover.\" The thought, upon which\r\nthe latter turns, is taken from a poem already cited, addressed by him\r\nto Mrs. Sheridan in 1773; and the following is the passage that supplied\r\nthe material:--\r\n\r\n  \"Alas, thou hast no wings, oh Time,\r\n  It was some thoughtless lover's rhyme,\r\n  Who, writing in his Chloe's view,\r\n  Paid her the compliment through you.\r\n  For, had he, if he truly lov'd,\r\n  But once the pangs of absence prov'd,\r\n  He'd cropt thy wings, and, in their stead,\r\n  Have painted thee with heels of lead.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen presently, that this poem was again despoiled of some of\r\nits lines, for an epilogue which he began a few years after, upon a very\r\ndifferent subject. There is something, it must be owned, not very\r\nsentimental in this conversion of the poetry of affection to other and\r\nless sacred uses--as if, like the ornaments of a passing pageant, it\r\nmight be broken up after the show was over, and applied to more useful\r\npurposes. That the young poet should be guilty of such sacrilege to\r\nlove, and thus steal back his golden offerings from the altar, to melt\r\nthem down into utensils of worldly display, can only be excused by that\r\ndemand upon the riches of his fancy, which the rapidity of his present\r\ncareer in the service of the dramatic muse occasioned.\r\n\r\nThere is not the same objection to the approbation of the other song,\r\nwhich, it will be seen, is a selection of the best parts of the\r\nfollowing Anacreontic verses:--\r\n\r\n  \"I ne'er could any lustre see\r\n[Footnote: Another mode of beginning this song in the MS.--\r\n  \"Go tell the maid who seeks to move\r\n  My lyre to praise, my heart to love,\r\n  No rose upon her cheek can live,\r\n  Like those assenting blushes give.\"]\r\n  In eyes that would not look on me:\r\n  When a glance aversion hints,\r\n  I always think the lady squints.\r\n  I ne'er saw nectar on a lip,\r\n  But where my own did hope to sip.\r\n  No pearly teeth rejoice my view,\r\n  Unless a 'yes' displays their hue--\r\n  The prudish lip, that _noes_ me back.\r\n  Convinces me the teeth are black,\r\n  To me the cheek displays no roses,\r\n  Like that th' assenting blush discloses;\r\n  But when with proud disdain 'tis spread,\r\n  To me 'tis but a scurvy red.\r\n  Would she have me praise her hair?\r\n  Let her place my garland there.\r\n  Is her hand so white and pure?\r\n  I must press it to be sure;\r\n  Nor can I be certain then,\r\n  Till it grateful press again.\r\n  Must I praise her melody?\r\n  Let her sing of love and me.\r\n  If she choose another theme,\r\n  I'd rather hear a peacock scream.\r\n  Must I, with attentive eye,\r\n  Watch her heaving bosom sigh?\r\n  I will do so, when I see\r\n  That heaving bosom sigh for me.\r\n  None but bigots will in vain\r\n  Adore a heav'n they cannot gain.\r\n  If I must religious prove\r\n  To the mighty God of Love,\r\n  Sure I am it is but fair\r\n  He, at least, should hear my prayer.\r\n  But, by each joy of his I've known,\r\n  And all I yet shall make my own,\r\n  Never will I, with humble speech,\r\n  Pray to a heav'n I cannot reach.\"\r\n\r\nIn the song, beginning \"Friendship is the bond of reason,\" the\r\nthird verse was originally thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"And, should I cheat the world and thee,\r\n    One smile from her I love to win,\r\n  Such breach of human faith would be\r\n    A sacrifice, and not a sin.\"\r\n\r\nTo the song \"'Give Isaac the nymph,\" there were at first two more\r\nverses, which, merely to show how judicious was the omission of them, I\r\nshall here transcribe. Next to the advantage of knowing what to put into\r\nour writings, is that of knowing what to leave out:--\r\n\r\n  \"To one thus accomplished I durst speak my mind,\r\n  And flattery doubtless would soon make her kind;\r\n  For the man that should praise her she needs must adore,\r\n  Who ne'er in her life receiv'd praises before.\r\n\r\n  \"But the frowns of a beauty in hopes to remove,\r\n  Should I prate of her charms, and tell of my love;\r\n  No thanks wait the praise which she knows to be true,\r\n  Nor smiles for the homage she takes as her due.\"\r\n\r\nAmong literary piracies or impostures, there are few more audacious than\r\nthe Dublin edition of the Duenna,--in which, though the songs are given\r\naccurately, an entirely new dialogue is substituted for that of\r\nSheridan, and his gold, as in the barter of Glaucus, exchanged for such\r\ncopper as the following:--\r\n\r\n\"_Duen._ Well, Sir, I don't want to stay in your house; but I must\r\ngo and lock up my wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Your wardrobe! when you came into my house you could\r\ncarry your wardrobe in your comb-case, you could, you old dragon.\"\r\n\r\nAnother specimen:--\r\n\r\n\"_Isaac._ Her voice, too, you told me, was like a Virginia\r\nNightingale; why, it is like a cracked warming-pan:--and as for\r\ndimples!--to be sure, she has the devil's own dimples.--Yes! and you\r\ntold me she had a lovely down upon her chin, like the down of a peach;\r\nbut, damn me if ever I saw such down upon any creature in my life,\r\nexcept once upon an old goat.\"\r\n\r\nThese jokes, I need not add, are all the gratuitous contributions of the\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1775, it was understood that Garrick meant\r\nto part with his moiety of the patent of Drury Lane Theatre, and retire\r\nfrom the stage. He was then in the sixtieth year of his age, and might\r\npossibly have been influenced by the natural feeling, so beautifully\r\nexpressed for a great actor of our own time, by our greatest living\r\nwriter:\r\n\r\n      ----\"Higher duties crave\r\n  Some space between the theatre and the grave;\r\n  That, like the Roman in the Capitol,\r\n  I may adjust my mantle, ere I fall.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Kemble's Farewell Address on taking leave of the Edinburgh\r\nstage, written by Sir Walter Scott.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the negotiation between him and Mr. Sheridan, which\r\nended in making the latter patentee and manager, cannot better be traced\r\nthan in Sheridan's own letters, addressed at the time to Mr. Linley, and\r\nmost kindly placed at my disposal by my friend Mr. William Linley.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, Dec. 31, 1775.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I was always one of the slowest letter-writers in the world, though I\r\nhave had more excuses than usual for my delay in this instance. The\r\nprincipal matter of business on which I was to have written to you,\r\nrelated to our embryo negotiation with Garrick, of which I will now give\r\nyou an account.\r\n\r\n\"Since you left town, Mrs. Ewart has been so ill, as to continue near\r\nthree weeks at the point of death. This, of course, has prevented Mr. E.\r\nfrom seeing anybody on business, or from accompanying me to Garrick's.\r\nHowever, about ten days ago, I talked the matter over with him by\r\nmyself, and the result was, appointing Thursday evening last to meet\r\nhim, and to bring Ewart, which I did accordingly. On the whole of our\r\nconversation that evening, I began (for the first time) to think him\r\n_really serious_ in the business. He still, however, kept the\r\nreserve of giving the refusal to Colman, though at the same time he did\r\nnot hesitate to assert his confidence that Colman would decline it. I\r\nwas determined to push him on this point, (as it was really farcical for\r\nus to treat with him under such an evasion,) and at last he promised to\r\nput the question to Colman, and to give me a decisive answer by the\r\nensuing Sunday (to-day). Accordingly, within this hour, I have received\r\na note from him, which (as I meant to show it my father) I here\r\ntranscribe for you.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Garrick presents his compliments to Mr. Sheridan, and, as he is\r\nobliged to go into the country for three days, he should be glad to see\r\nhim upon his return to town, either on Wednesday about 6 or 7 o'clock,\r\nor whenever he pleases. The party has no objection to the whole, but\r\nchooses no partner but Mr. G. Not a word of this yet. Mr. G. sent a\r\nmessenger on purpose, (i.e. to Colman). He would call upon Mr. S., but\r\nhe is confined at home. Your name is upon our list'.\r\n\r\n\"This _decisive answer_ may be taken two ways. However, as Mr. G.\r\ninformed Mr. Ewart and me, that he had no authority or pretensions to\r\ntreat for _the whole_, it appears to me that Mr. Garrick's meaning\r\nin this note is, that Mr. Colman _declines_ the purchase of _Mr.\r\nGarrick's share_, which is the point in debate, and the only part at\r\npresent to be sold. I shall, therefore, wait on G. at the time\r\nmentioned, and, if I understand him right, we shall certainly without\r\ndelay appoint two men of business and the law to meet on the matter, and\r\ncome to a conclusion without further delay.\r\n\r\n\"_According_ to his demand, the whole is valued at 70,000_l_.\r\nHe appears very shy of letting his books be looked into, as the test of\r\nthe profits on this sum, but says it must be, in its nature, a purchase\r\non speculation. However, he has promised me a rough estimate, of _his\r\nown_, of the entire receipts for the last seven years. But, after\r\nall, it must certainly be a _purchase on speculation_, without\r\n_money's worth_ being _made out_. One point he solemnly avers,\r\nwhich is, that he will never part with it under the price above-\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\"This is all I can say on the subject till Wednesday, though I can't\r\nhelp adding, that I think we might _safely_ give five thousand\r\npounds more on this purchase than richer people. The whole valued at\r\n70,000_l_., the annual interest is 3,500_l_.; while this is\r\n_cleared_, the proprietors are safe,--but I think it must be\r\n_infernal_ management indeed that does not double it.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose Mr. Stanley has written to you relative to your oratorio\r\norchestra. The demand, I reckon, will be diminished one third, and the\r\nappearance remain very handsome, which, if the other affair takes place,\r\nyou will find your account in; and, if you discontinue your partnership\r\nwith Stanley at Drury Lane, the orchestra may revert to whichever wants\r\nit, on the other's paying his proportion for the use of it this year.\r\nThis is Mr. Garrick's idea, and, as he says, might in that case be\r\nsettled by arbitration.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard of our losing Miss Brown; however, we have missed her so\r\nlittle in the Duenna, that the managers have not tried to regain her,\r\nwhich I believe they might have done. I have had some books of the music\r\nthese many days to send you down. I wanted to put Tom's name in the new\r\nmusic, and begged Mrs. L. to ask you, and let me have a line on her\r\narrival, for which purpose I kept back the index of the songs. If you or\r\nhe have no objection, pray let me know. I'll send the music to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"I am finishing a two act comedy for Covent-Garden, which will be in\r\nrehearsal in a week. We have given the Duenna a respite this Christmas,\r\nbut nothing else at present brings money. We have every place in the\r\nhouse taken for the three next nights, and shall, at least, play it\r\nfifty nights, with only the Friday's intermission.\r\n\r\n\"My best love and the compliments of the season to all your fire-side.\r\n\r\n\"Your grandson is a very magnificent fellow. [Footnote: Sheridan's first\r\nchild, Thomas, born in the preceding year.]\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\"January 4, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I left Garrick last night too late to write to you. He has offered\r\nColman the refusal, and showed me his answer; which was (as in the note)\r\nthat he was willing to purchase the whole, but would have no partner but\r\nGarrick. On this, Mr. Garrick appointed a meeting with his partner,\r\nyoung Leasy, and, in presence of their solicitor, treasurer, &c.,\r\ndeclared to him that he was absolutely on the point of settling, and, if\r\n_he_ was willing, he might have the same price for his share; but\r\nthat if he (Leasy) would not sell, Mr. Garrick would, instantly, to\r\nanother party. The result was, Leasy's declaring his intention of not\r\nparting with his share. Of this Garrick again informed Colman, who\r\nimmediately gave up the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\"Garrick was extremely explicit, and, in short, we came to a final\r\nresolution. So that, if the necessary matters are made out to all our\r\nsatisfactions, we may sign and seal a previous agreement within a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n\"I meet him again to-morrow evening, when we are to name a day for a\r\nconveyancer on our side, to meet his solicitor, Wallace. I have pitched\r\non a Mr. Phips, at the recommendation and by the advice of Dr. Ford. The\r\nthree first steps to be taken are these,--our lawyer is to look into the\r\ntitles, tenures, &c. of the house and adjoining estate, the extent and\r\nlimitations of the patent, &c. We should then employ a builder (I think,\r\nMr. Collins,) to survey the state and repair in which the whole premises\r\nare, to which G. entirely assents. Mr. G. will then give us a fair and\r\nattested estimate from his books of what the profits have been, at an\r\naverage, for these last seven years. [Footnote: These accounts were\r\nfound among Mr. Sheridan's papers. Garrick's income from the theatre for\r\nthe year 1775-6 is thus stated:--\"Author 400_l_., salary,\r\n800_l_., manager 500_l_.\"] This he has shown me in rough, and\r\nvaluing the property at 70,000_l_, the interest has exceeded ten\r\npercent.\r\n\r\n\"We should, after this, certainly make an interest to get the King's\r\npromise, that, while the theatre is well conducted, &c. he will grant no\r\npatent to a third,--though G. seems confident that he never will. If\r\nthere is any truth in professions and appearances, G. seems likely\r\nalways to continue our friend, and to give every assistance in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"The method of our sharing the purchase, I should think, may be thus,--\r\nEwart, to take 10,000_l_., you 10,000_l_, and I,\r\n10,000_l_.--Dr. Ford agrees, with the greatest pleasure, to embark\r\nthe other five; and if you do not choose to venture so much, will, I\r\ndare say, share it with you. Ewart is preparing his money, and I have a\r\ncertainty of my part. We shall have a very useful ally in Dr. Ford; and\r\nmy father offers his services on our own terms. We cannot unite Garrick\r\nto our interests too firmly; and I am convinced his influence will bring\r\nLeasy to our terms, if he should be ill-advised enough to desire to\r\ninterfere in what he is totally unqualified for.\r\n\r\n\"I'll write to you to-morrow relative to Leasy's mortgage (which Garrick\r\nhas, and advises us to take), and many other particulars. When matters\r\nare in a certain train (which I hope will be in a week,) I suppose you\r\nwill not hesitate to come to town for a day or two. Garrick proposes,\r\nwhen we are satisfied with the bargain, to sign a previous article, with\r\na penalty of ten thousand pounds on the parties who break from\r\nfulfilling the purchase. When we are once satisfied and determined in\r\nthe business (which, I own, is my case), the sooner that is done the\r\nbetter. I must urge it particularly, as my confidential connection with\r\nthe other house is peculiarly distressing, till I can with prudence\r\nreveal my situation, and such a treaty (however prudently managed)\r\ncannot long be kept secret, especially as Leasy is now convinced of\r\nGarrick's resolution.\r\n\r\n\"I am exceedingly hurried at present, so, excuse omissions, and do not\r\nflag when we come to the point. I'll answer for it, we shall see many\r\ngolden campaigns.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard, I suppose, that Foote is likely never to show his face\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"January 31st, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have found a person who will let you have the money at\r\nfour per cent. The security will be very clear; but, as there is some\r\ndegree of risk, as in case of fire, I think four per cent uncommonly\r\nreasonable.--It will scarcely be any advantage to pay it off, for your\r\nhouses and chapel, I suppose, bring in much more. Therefore, while you\r\ncan raise money at four per cent, on the security of your theatrical\r\nshare _only_, you will be right to alter, as little as you can, the\r\npresent disposition of your property.\r\n\r\n\"As to your quitting Bath, I cannot see why you should doubt a moment\r\nabout it. Surely, the undertaking in which you embark such a sum as\r\n10,000_l_. ought to be the chief object of your attention--and,\r\nsupposing you did not choose to give up all your time to the theatre,\r\nyou may certainly employ yourself more profitably in London than in\r\nBath. But, if you are willing (as I suppose you will be) to make the\r\ntheatre the great object of your attention, rely on it you may lay aside\r\nevery doubt of not finding your account in it; for the fact is, we shall\r\nhave nothing but our own equity to consult in making and obtaining any\r\ndemand for exclusive trouble. Leasy is utterly unequal to any department\r\nin the theatre. He has an opinion of me, and is very willing to let the\r\nwhole burthen and ostensibility be taken off his shoulders. But I\r\ncertainly should not give up my time and labor (for his superior\r\nadvantage, having so much greater a share) without some exclusive\r\nadvantage. Yet, I should by no means make the demand till I had shown\r\nmyself equal to the task. My father purposes to be with us but one year;\r\nand that only to give me what advantage he can from his experience. He\r\ncertainly must be paid for his trouble, and so certainly must you. You\r\nhave experience and character equal to the line you would undertake; and\r\nit never can enter into any body's head that you were to give your time\r\nor any part of your attention gratis, because you had a share in the\r\ntheatre. I have spoke on this subject both to Garrick and Leasy, and you\r\nwill find no demur on any side to your gaining a _certain_ income\r\nfrom the theatre--greater, I think, than you could make out of it--and\r\nin this the theatre will be acting only for its own advantage. At the\r\nsame time you may always make leisure for a few select scholars, whose\r\ninterest may also serve the greater cause of your patentee-ship.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a young man with me who wants to appear as a singer in plays\r\nor oratorios. I think you'll find him likely to be serviceable in\r\neither. He is not one-and-twenty, and has no conceit. He has a good\r\ntenor voice--very good ear and a great deal of execution, of the right\r\nkind. He reads notes very quick, and can accompany himself. This is\r\nBetsey's verdict, who sat in judgment on him on Sunday last. I have\r\ngiven him no answer, but engaged him to wait till you come to town.\r\n\r\n\"You must not regard the reports in the paper about a third theatre--\r\nthat's all nonsense.\r\n\r\n\"Betsey's and my love to all. Your grandson astonishes every body by his\r\nvivacity, his talents for music and poetry, and the most perfect\r\nintegrity of mind.\r\n\r\n\"Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following June the contract with Garrick was perfected; and in a\r\npaper drawn up by Mr. Sheridan many years after, I find the shares of\r\nthe respective purchasers thus stated:-\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan, two fourteenths of the whole. 10,000_l_.\r\nMr. Linley, ditto                           10,000_l_.\r\nDr. Ford, 3 ditto                           15,000_l_.\r\n\r\nMr. Ewart, it will be perceived, though originally mentioned as one of\r\nthe parties, had no concern in the final arrangement.\r\n\r\nThough the letters, just cited, furnish a more detailed account than has\r\nyet been given to the public of this transaction by which Mr. Sheridan\r\nbecame possessed of his theatrical property, they still leave us in the\r\ndark with respect to the source from which his own means of completing\r\nthe purchase were derived. Not even to Mr. Linley, while entering into\r\nall other details, does he hint at the fountain head from which this\r\nsupply is to come:--\r\n\r\n  _\"--gentes maluit ortus\r\n  Mirari, quam nosse tuos.\"_\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, something mysterious and miraculous about all his\r\nacquisitions, whether in love, in learning, in wit, or in wealth. How or\r\nwhen his stock of knowledge was laid in, nobody knew--it was as much a\r\nmatter of marvel to those who never saw him read, as the existence of\r\nthe chameleon has been to those who fancied it never eat. His advances\r\nin the heart of his mistress were, as we have seen, equally trackless\r\nand inaudible, and his triumph was the first that even rivals knew of\r\nhis love. In like manner, the productions of his wit took the world by\r\nsurprise,--being perfected in secret, till ready for display, and then\r\nseeming to break from under the cloud of his indolence in full maturity\r\nof splendor. His financial resources had no less an air of magic about\r\nthem; and the mode by which he conjured up, at this time, the money for\r\nhis first purchase into the theatre, remains, as far as I can learn,\r\nstill a mystery. It has been said that Mr. Garrick supplied him with the\r\nmeans--but a perusal of the above letters must set that notion to rest.\r\nThere was evidently, at this time, no such confidential understanding\r\nbetween them as an act of friendship of so signal a nature would imply;\r\nand it appears that Sheridan had the purchase money ready, even before\r\nthe terms upon which Garrick would sell were ascertained. That Doctor\r\nFord should have advanced the money is not less improbable; for the\r\nshare of which, contrary to his first intention, he ultimately became\r\nproprietor, absorbed, there is every reason to think, the whole of his\r\ndisposable means. He was afterwards a sufferer by the concern to such an\r\nextent, as to be obliged, in consequence of his embarrassments, to\r\nabsent himself for a considerable time from England; and there are among\r\nthe papers of Mr. Sheridan, several letters of remonstrance addressed to\r\nhim by the son of Dr. Ford, in which some allusion to such a friendly\r\nservice, had it ever occurred, would hardly have been omitted.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this year some dissensions arose between the new\r\npatentees and Mr. Lacy, in consequence of the expressed intention of the\r\nlatter to introduce two other partners into the establishment, by the\r\ndisposal of his share to Captain Thomson and a Mr. Langford. By an\r\naccount of this transaction, which appears in a Periodical Paper\r\npublished at the time, [Footnote: The Selector] and which, from its\r\ncorrectness in other particulars, I rather think may be depended on, it\r\nwould seem that Sheridan, in his opposition to Lacy, had proceeded to\r\nthe extremity of seceding from his own duties at the theatre, and\r\ninducing the principal actors to adopt the same line of conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Does not the rage (asks this writer) of the new managers, all directed\r\nagainst the innocent and justifiable conduct of Mr. Lacy, look as if\r\nthey meant to rule a theatre, of which they have only a moiety among\r\nthem, and feared the additional weight and influence which would be\r\ngiven to Mr. Lacy by the assistance of Captain Thomson and Mr. Langford?\r\nIf their intentions were right, why should they fear to have their power\r\nbalanced, and their conduct examined? Is there a precedent in the annals\r\nof the theatre, where the acting manager deserted the general property,\r\nleft the house, and seduced the actors from their duties--why?\r\nforsooth, because he was angry. Is not such conduct actionable? In any\r\nconcern of common property, Lord Mansfield would make it so. And, what\r\nan insult to the public, from whose indulgence and favor this conceited\r\nyoung man, with his wife and family, are to receive their daily bread!\r\nBecause Mr. Lacy, in his opinion, had used him ill--his patrons and\r\nbenefactors might go to the devil! Mr. Lacy acted with great temper and\r\nmoderation; and, in order that the public might not be wholly\r\ndisappointed, he brought on old stock-plays--his brother manager\r\nhaving robbed him of the means and instruments to do otherwise, by\r\ntaking away the performers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also intimated in the same publication that Mr. Garrick had on\r\nthis occasion \"given Mr. Sheridan credit on his banker for\r\n20,000_l_. for law expenses or for the purchase of Messrs. Langford\r\nand Thomson's shares.\"\r\n\r\nThe dispute, however, was adjusted amicably. Mr. Lacy was prevailed upon\r\nto write an apology to the public, and the design of disposing of his\r\nshare in the theatre was, for the present, relinquished.\r\n\r\nThere is an allusion to this reconciliation in the following\r\ncharacteristic letter, addressed by Sheridan to Mr. Linley in the spring\r\nof the following year.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"You write to me though you tell me you have nothing to say--now, I have\r\nreversed the case, and have not wrote to you, because I have had so much\r\nto say. However, I find I have delayed too long to attempt now to\r\ntransmit you a long detail of our theatrical manoeuvres; but you must\r\nnot attribute my not writing to idleness, but on the contrary to my\r\n_not_ having been idle.\r\n\r\n\"You represent your situation of mind between _hopes_ and\r\n_fears_. I am afraid I should argue in vain (as I have often on\r\nthis point before) were I to tell you, that it is always better to\r\nencourage the former than the latter. It may be very prudent to mix a\r\nlittle _fear_ by way of alloy with a good solid mass of\r\n_hope_; but you, on the contrary, always deal in\r\n_apprehension_ by the pound, and take _confidence_ by the\r\ngrain, and spread as thin as leaf gold. In fact, though a metaphor\r\nmayn't explain it, the truth is, that, in all undertakings which depend\r\nprincipally on ourselves, the surest way not to fail is to _determine\r\nto succeed_.\r\n\r\n\"It would be endless to say more at present about theatrical matters,\r\nonly, that every thing is going on very well. Lacy promised me to write\r\nto you, which I suppose, however, he has not done. At our first meeting\r\nafter you left town, he cleared away all my doubts about his sincerity;\r\nand I dare swear we shall never have the least misunderstanding again,\r\nnor do I believe he will ever take any distinct counsel in future.\r\nRelative to your affair he has not the shade of an objection remaining,\r\nand is only anxious that you may not take amiss his boggling at first.\r\nWe have, by and with the advice of the privy council, concluded to have\r\nNoverre over, and there is a species of pantomime to be shortly put on\r\nfoot, which is to draw all the human kind to Drury. [Footnote: I find\r\nthat the pantomime at Drury Lane this year was a revival of \"Harlequin's\r\nInvasion,\" and that at Covent Garden, \"Harlequin's Frolics.\"] This is\r\nbecome absolutely necessary on account of a marvellous preparation of\r\nthe kind which is making at Covent Garden.\r\n\r\n\"Touching the tragedies you mention, if you speak of them merely as\r\ncertain tragedies that may be had, I should think it impossible we could\r\nfind the least room, as you know Garrick saddles us with one which we\r\n_must_ bring out. But, if you have any particular desire that one\r\nof them should be done, it is another affair, and I should be glad to\r\nsee them. Otherwise, I would much rather you would save the\r\ndisagreeableness of giving my opinion to a fresh tragic bard, being\r\nalready in disgrace with about nine of that irascible fraternity.\r\n\r\n\"Betsey has been alarmed about Tom, but without reason. He is in my\r\nopinion better than when you left him, at least to appearance, and the\r\ncold he caught is gone. We sent to see him at Battersea, and would have\r\npersuaded him to remove to Orchard Street; but he thinks the air does\r\nhim good, and he seems with people where he is at home, and may divert\r\nhimself, which, perhaps, will do him more good than the air,--but he is\r\nto be with us soon.\r\n\r\n\"Ormsby has sent me a silver branch on the score of the Duenna. This\r\nwill cost me, what of all things I am least free of, a letter: and it\r\nshould have been a poetical one, too, if the present had been any piece\r\nof plate but a candlestick!--I believe I must melt it into a bowl to\r\nmake verses on it, for there is no possibility of bringing candle,\r\ncandlestick, or snuffers, into metre. However, as the gift was owing to\r\nthe muse, and the manner of it very friendly, I believe I shall try to\r\njingle a little on the occasion; at least, a few such stanzas as might\r\ngain a cup of tea from the urn at Bath-Easton.\r\n\r\n\"Betsey is very well, and on the point of giving Tom up to feed like a\r\nChristian and a gentleman, or, in other words, of weaning, waining, or\r\nweening him. As for the young gentleman himself, his progress is so\r\nrapid, that one may plainly see the astonishment the sun is in of a\r\nmorning, at the improvement of the night. Our loves to all.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever, and truly,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nThe first contribution which the dramatic talent of the new manager\r\nfurnished to the stock of the theatre, was an alteration of Vanbrugh's\r\ncomedy, The Relapse, which was brought out on the 24th of February,\r\n1777, under the title of \"A Trip to Scarborough.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading the original play, we are struck with surprise, that Sheridan\r\nshould ever have hoped to be able to _defecate_ such dialogue, and\r\nyet leave any of the wit, whose whole spirit is in the lees, behind. The\r\nvery life of such characters as Berinthia is their licentiousness, and\r\nit is with them, as with objects that are luminous from putrescence,--to\r\nremove their taint is to extinguish their light. If Sheridan, indeed,\r\nhad substituted some of his own wit for that which he took away, the\r\ninanition that followed the operation would have been much less sensibly\r\nfelt. But to be so liberal of a treasure so precious, and for the\r\nenrichment of the work of another, could hardly have been expected from\r\nhim. Besides, it may be doubted whether the subject had not already\r\nyielded its utmost to Vanbrugh, and whether even in the hands of\r\nSheridan, it could have been brought to bear a second crop of wit. Here\r\nand there through the dialogue, there are some touches from his pen--\r\nmore, however, in the style of his farce than his comedy. For instance,\r\nthat speech of Lord Foppington, where, directing the hosier not \"to\r\nthicken the calves of his stockings so much,\" he says, \"You should\r\nalways remember, Mr. Hosier, that if you make a nobleman's spring legs\r\nas robust as his autumnal calves, you commit a monstrous impropriety,\r\nand make no allowance for the fatigues of the winter.\" Again, the\r\nfollowing dialogue:--\r\n\r\n\"_Jeweller._ I hope, my lord, those buckles have had the\r\nunspeakable satisfaction of being honored with your lordship's\r\napprobation?\r\n\r\n\"_Lord F._ Why, they are of a pretty fancy; but don't you think\r\nthem rather of the smallest?\r\n\r\n\"_Jeweller._ My lord, they could not well be larger, to keep on\r\nyour lordship's shoe.\r\n\r\n\"_Lord F._ My good sir, you forget that these matters are not as\r\nthey used to be: formerly, indeed, the buckle was a sort of machine,\r\nintended to keep on the shoe; but the case is now quite reversed, and\r\nthe shoe is of no earthly use but to keep on the buckle.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mrs. Sheridan went to pass a few weeks with her father\r\nand mother at Bath, while Sheridan himself remained in town, to\r\nsuperintend the concerns of the theatre. During this interval he\r\naddressed to her the following verses, which I quote, less from their\r\nown peculiar merit, than as a proof how little his heart had yet lost of\r\nthose first feelings of love and gallantry which too often expire in\r\nmatrimony, as Faith and Hope do in heaven, and from the same causes--\r\n\r\n  \"One lost in certainty, and one in joy.\"\r\n\r\n  TO LAURA.\r\n\r\n  \"Near Avon's ridgy bank there grows\r\n    A willow of no vulgar size,\r\n  That tree first heard poor Silvio's woes,\r\n    And heard how bright were Laura's eyes.\r\n\r\n  Its boughs were shade from heat or show'r,\r\n    Its roots a moss-grown seat became;\r\n  Its leaves would strew the maiden's bow'r,\r\n    Its bark was shatter'd with her name!\r\n\r\n  Once on a blossom-crowned day\r\n    Of mirth-inspiring May,\r\n  Silvio, beneath this willow's sober shade,\r\n    In sullen contemplation laid,\r\n\r\n  Did mock the meadow's flowery pride,--\r\n    Rail'd at the dance and sportive ring;--\r\n  The tabor's call he did deride,\r\n    And said, _it was not Spring_.\r\n\r\n  He scorn'd the sky of azure blue,\r\n    He scorn'd whate'er could mirth bespeak;\r\n  He chid the beam that drank the dew,\r\n    And chid the gale that fann'd his glowing cheek.\r\n  Unpaid the season's wanton lay,\r\n  For still he sigh'd, and said, it _was not May_.\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, why should the glittering stream\r\n    Reflect thus delusive the scene?\r\n  Ah, why does a rosy-ting'd beam\r\n    Thus vainly enamel the green?\r\n  To me nor joy nor light they bring:\r\n  I tell thee, Phoebus, _'tis not Spring_.\r\n\r\n  \"Sweet tut'ress of music and love,\r\n    Sweet bird, if 'tis thee that I hear,\r\n  Why left you so early the grove,\r\n    To lavish your melody here?\r\n  Cease, then, mistaken thus to sing,\r\n  Sweet nightingale! it _is not Spring_.\r\n\r\n  \"The gale courts my locks but to tease,\r\n    And, Zephyr, I call not on thee:\r\n  Thy fragrance no longer can please,\r\n    Then rob not the blossoms for me:\r\n  But hence unload thy balmy wing,\r\n  Believe me, Zephyr, 'tis _not Spring_.\r\n\r\n  \"Yet the lily has drank of the show'r,\r\n    And the rose 'gins to peep on the day;\r\n  And yon bee seems to search for a flow'r,\r\n    As busy as if it were May:--\r\n  In vain, thou senseless flutt'ring thing,\r\n  My heart informs me, _'tis not Spring.\"_\r\n\r\n  May pois'd her roseate wings, for she had heard\r\n    The mourner, as she pass'd the vales along;\r\n  And, silencing her own indignant bird,\r\n    She thus reprov'd poor Silvio's song.\r\n\r\n  \"How false is the sight of a lover;\r\n  How ready his spleen to discover\r\n    What reason would never allow!\r\n  Why,--Silvio, my sunshine and showers,\r\n  My blossoms, my birds, and my flow'rs,\r\n    Were never more perfect than now.\r\n\r\n  \"The water's reflection is true,\r\n  The green is enamell'd to view,\r\n    And Philomel sings on the spray;\r\n  The gale is the breathing of spring,\r\n  'Tis fragrance it bears on its wing,\r\n    And the bee is assur'd it is _May_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Pardon (said Silvio with a gushing tear),\r\n  _'Tis_ spring, sweet nymph, _but Laura is not here_.\"\r\n\r\nIn sending these verses to Mrs. Sheridan, he had also written her a\r\ndescription of some splendid party, at which he had lately been present,\r\nwhere all the finest women of the world of fashion were assembled. His\r\npraises of their beauty, as well as his account of their flattering\r\nattentions to himself, awakened a feeling of at least poetical jealousy\r\nin Mrs. Sheridan, which she expressed in the following answer to his\r\nverses--taking occasion, at the same time, to pay some generous\r\ncompliments to the most brilliant among his new fashionable friends.\r\nThough her verses are of that kind which we read more with interest than\r\nadmiration, they have quite enough of talent for the gentle themes to\r\nwhich she aspired; and there is, besides, a charm about them, as coming\r\nfrom Mrs. Sheridan, to which far better poetry could not pretend.\r\n\r\n  TO SILVIO.\r\n\r\n  \"Soft flow'd the lay by Avon's sedgy side,\r\n    While o'er its streams the drooping willow hung\r\n  Beneath whose shadow Silvio fondly tried\r\n    To check the opening roses as they sprung.\r\n\r\n  In vain he bade them cease to court the gale,\r\n    That wanton'd balmy on the zephyr's wing;\r\n  In vain, when Philomel renew'd her tale,\r\n    He chid her song, and said _'It was not Spring.'_\r\n\r\n  For still they bloom'd, tho' Silvio's heart was sad,\r\n    Nor did sweet Philomel neglect to sing;\r\n  The zephyrs scorned them not, tho' Silvio had,\r\n    For love and nature told them it was Spring.\r\n[Footnote: As the poem altogether would be too long, I have here omitted\r\nfive or six stanzas]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  To other scenes doth Silvio now repair,\r\n    To nobler themes his daring Muse aspires;\r\n  Around him throng the gay, the young, the fair,\r\n    His lively wit the listening crowd admires.\r\n\r\n  And see, where radiant Beauty smiling stands,\r\n    With gentle voice and soft beseeching eyes,\r\n  To gain the laurel from his willing hands,\r\n    Her every art the fond enchantress tries.\r\n\r\n  What various charms the admiring youth surround,\r\n    How shall he sing, or how attempt to praise?\r\n  So lovely all--where shall the bard be found,\r\n    Who can to _one_ alone attune his lays?\r\n\r\n  Behold with graceful step and smile serene,\r\n    Majestic Stella moves to claim the prize:\r\n[Footnote: According to the Key which has been given me, the name of\r\nStella was meant to designate the Duchess of Rutland]\r\n  \"'Tis thine,\" he cries, \"for thou art beauty's queen.\"\r\n    Mistaken youth! and sees't thou Myra's eyes?\r\n[Footnote: The Duchess of Devonshire]\r\n\r\n  With beaming lustre see they dart at thee:\r\n    Ah I dread their vengeance--yet withhold thy hand,--\r\n  That deepening blush upbraids thy rash decree;\r\n    Hers is the wreath--obey the just demand.\r\n\r\n  \"Pardon, bright nymph,\"(the wond'ring Silvio cries)\r\n    \"And oh, receive the wreath thy beauty's due\"--\r\n  His voice awards what still his hand denies,\r\n    For beauteous Amoret now his eyes pursue.\r\n[Footnote: Mrs. (afterward Lady) Crewe]\r\n\r\n  With gentle step and hesitating grace,\r\n    Unconscious of her pow'r the fair one came;\r\n  If, while he view'd the glories of that face,\r\n    Poor Silvio doubted,--who shall dare to blame?\r\n\r\n  A rosy blush his ardent gaze reprov'd,\r\n    The offer'd wreath she modestly declined;--\r\n  \"If sprightly wit and dimpled smiles are lov'd,\r\n    My brow,\" said Flavia, \"shall that garland bind.\"\r\n[Footnote: Lady Craven, afterwards Margravine of Anspach.]\r\n\r\n  With wanton gaiety the prize she seized--\r\n    Silvio in vain her snowy hand repell'd;\r\n  The fickle youth unwillingly was pleas'd,\r\n    Reluctantly the wreath he yet withheld.\r\n\r\n  But Jessie's all-seducing form appears,\r\n[Footnote: The late Countess of Jersey.]\r\n    Nor more the playful Flavia could delight;\r\n  Lovely in smiles, more lovely still in tears,\r\n    Her every glance shone eloquently bright.\r\n\r\n  Those radiant eyes in safety none could view,\r\n    Did not those fringed lids their brightness shade--\r\n  Mistaken youths! their beams, too late ye knew,\r\n    Are by that soft defence more fatal made.\r\n\r\n  \"O God of Love!\" with transport Silvio cries,\r\n    \"Assist me thou, this contest to decide;\r\n  And since to _one_ I cannot yield the prize,\r\n    Permit thy slave the garland to divide.\r\n\r\n  \"On Myra's breast the opening rose shall blow,\r\n    Reflecting from her cheek a livelier bloom;\r\n  For Stella shall the bright carnation glow--\r\n    Beneath her eyes' bright radiance meet its doom.\r\n\r\n  \"Smart pinks and daffodils shall Flavia grace,\r\n    The modest eglantine and violet blue\r\n  On gentle Amoret's placid brow I'll place--\r\n    Of elegance and love an emblem true.\"\r\n\r\n  In gardens oft a beauteous flow'r there grows,\r\n    By vulgar eyes unnoticed and unseen;\r\n  In sweet security it humbly blows,\r\n    And rears its purple head to deck the green.\r\n\r\n  This flower, as nature's poet sweetly sings,\r\n    Was once milk-white, and _hearts-ease_ was its name;\r\n  Till wanton Cupid pois'd his roseate wings,\r\n    A vestal's sacred bosom to inflame;\r\n\r\n  With treacherous aim the god his arrow drew,\r\n    Which she with icy coldness did repel;\r\n  Rebounding thence with feathery speed it flew,\r\n    Till on this lonely flow'r at last it fell.\r\n\r\n  Heart's-ease no more the wandering shepherds found,\r\n    No more the nymphs its snowy form possess;\r\n  Its white now chang'd to purple by Love's wound,\r\n    Heart's-ease no more, 'tis \"Love in Idleness.\"\r\n\r\n  \"This flow'r with sweet-brier join'd shall thee adorn,\r\n    Sweet Jessie, fairest 'mid ten thousand fair!\r\n  But guard thy gentle bosom from the thorn,\r\n    Which, tho' conceal'd, the sweet-brier still must bear.\r\n\r\n  \"And place not Love, tho' _idle_, in thy breast,\r\n    Tho' bright its hues, it boasts no other charm--\r\n  So may thy future days be ever blest,\r\n    And friendship's calmer joys thy bosom warm !\"\r\n\r\n  But where does Laura pass her lonely hours?\r\n    Does she still haunt the grot and willow-tree?\r\n  Shall Silvio from his wreath of various flowr's\r\n    Neglect to cull one simple sweet for thee?\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, Laura, no,\" the constant Silvio cries,\r\n    \"For thee a never-fading wreath I'll twine;\r\n  Though bright the rose, its bloom too swiftly flies,\r\n    No emblem meet for love so true as mine.\r\n\r\n  \"For thee, my love, the myrtle, ever-green,\r\n    Shall every year its blossom sweet disclose,\r\n  Which, when our spring of youth no more is seen,\r\n    Shall still appear more lovely than the rose.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Forgive, dear youth,\" the happy Laura said,\r\n    \"Forgive each doubt, each fondly anxious fear,\r\n  Which from my heart for ever now is fled--\r\n    Thy love and truth, thus tried, are doubly dear.\r\n\r\n  \"With pain I mark'd the various passions rise,\r\n    When beauty so divine before thee mov'd;\r\n  With trembling doubt beheld thy wandering eyes,\r\n    For still I fear'd;--alas!

As this\r\nspecies of composition seems, more, perhaps, than any other, to require\r\nthat knowledge of human nature and the world which experience alone can\r\ngive, it seems not a little extraordinary that nearly all our first-rate\r\ncomedies should have been the productions of very young men. Those of\r\nCongreve were all written before he was five-and-twenty. Farquhar\r\nproduced the Constant Couple in his two-and-twentieth year, and died at\r\nthirty. Vanbrugh was a young ensign when he sketched out the Relapse and\r\nthe Provoked Wife, and Sheridan crowned his reputation with the School\r\nfor Scandal at six-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, still more remarkable to find, as in the instance before\r\nus, that works which, at this period of life, we might suppose to have\r\nbeen the rapid offspring of a careless, but vigorous fancy,--\r\nanticipating the results of experience by a sort of second-sight\r\ninspiration,--should, on the contrary, have been the slow result of many\r\nand doubtful experiments, gradually unfolding beauties unforeseen even\r\nby him who produced them, and arriving, at length, step by step, at\r\nperfection. That such was the tardy process by which the School for\r\nScandal was produced, will appear from the first sketches of its plan\r\nand dialogue, which I am here enabled to lay before the reader, and\r\nwhich cannot fail to interest deeply all those who take delight in\r\ntracing the alchemy of genius, and in watching the first slow workings\r\nof the menstruum, out of which its finest transmutations arise.\r\n\r\n\"Genius,\" says Buffon, \"is Patience;\" or, (as another French writer has\r\nexplained his thought)--\"La Patience cherche, et le Genie trouve;\" and\r\nthere is little doubt that to the co-operation of these two powers all\r\nthe brightest inventions of this world are owing;--that Patience must\r\nfirst explore the depths where the pearl lies hid, before Genius boldly\r\ndives and brings it up full into light. There are, it is true, some\r\nstriking exceptions to this rule; and our own times have witnessed more\r\nthan one extraordinary intellect, whose depth has not prevented their\r\ntreasures from lying ever ready within reach. But the records of\r\nImmortality furnish few such instances; and all we know of the works,\r\nthat she has hitherto marked with her seal, sufficiently authorize the\r\ngeneral position,--that nothing great and durable has ever been produced\r\nwith ease, and that Labor is the parent of all the lasting wonders of\r\nthis world, whether in verse or stone, whether poetry or pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe first sketch of the School for Scandal that occurs was written, I am\r\ninclined to think, before the Rivals, or at least very soon after it;--\r\nand that it was his original intention to satirize some of the gossips\r\nof Bath appears from the title under which I find noted down, as\r\nfollows, the very first hints, probably, that suggested themselves for\r\nthe dialogue.\r\n\r\n\"THE SLANDERERS.--_A Pump-Room Scene_.\r\n\r\n\"Friendly caution to the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\"It is whispered--\r\n\r\n\"She is a constant attendant at church, and very frequently takes Dr.\r\nM'Brawn home with her.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthy is very good to the girl;--for my part, I dare swear he has\r\nno ill intention.\r\n\r\n\"What! Major Wesley's Miss Montague?\r\n\r\n\"Lud, ma'am, the match is certainly broke--no creature knows the cause;\r\nsome say a flaw in the lady's character, and others, in the gentleman's\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure they do say--\r\n\r\n\"I hate to repeat what I hear.\r\n\r\n\"She was inclined to be a little too plump before she went.\r\n\r\n\"The most intrepid blush;--I've known her complexion stand fire for an\r\nhour together.\r\n\r\n\"'She had twins,'--How ill-natured! as I hope to be saved, ma'am, she\r\nhad but one; and that a little starved brat not worth mentioning.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the opening scene of his first sketch, from which it\r\nwill be perceived that the original plot was wholly different from what\r\nit is at present,--Sir Peter and Lady Teazle being at that time not in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"LADY SNEERWELL and SPATTER.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ The paragraphs, you say, were all inserted.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ They were, madam.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Did you circulate the report of Lady Brittle's intrigue\r\nwith Captain Boastall?\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ Madam, by this Lady Brittle is the talk of half the town;\r\nand in a week will be treated as a demirep.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ What have you done as to the innuendo of Miss Niceley's\r\nfondness for her own footman?\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ 'Tis in a fair train, ma'am. I told it to my hair-\r\ndresser,--he courts a milliner's girl in Pall Mall, whose mistress has a\r\nfirst cousin who is waiting-woman to Lady Clackit. I think in about\r\nfourteen hours it must reach Lady Clackit, and then you know the\r\nbusiness is done.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ But is that sufficient, do you think?\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ O Lud, ma'am, I'll undertake to ruin the character of the\r\nprimmest prude in London with half as much. Ha! ha! Did your ladyship\r\nnever hear how poor Miss Shepherd lost her lover and her character last\r\nsummer at Scarborough? this was the whole of it. One evening at Lady\r\n----'s, the conversation happened to turn on the difficulty of breeding\r\nNova Scotia sheep in England. 'I have known instances,' says Miss ---,\r\n'for last spring, a friend of mine, Miss Shepherd of Ramsgate, had a Nova\r\nScotia sheep that produced her twins.'--'What!' cries the old deaf\r\ndowager Lady Bowlwell, 'has Miss Shepherd of Ramsgate been brought to\r\nbed of twins?' This mistake, as you may suppose, set the company\r\nlaughing. However, the next day, Miss Verjuice Amarilla Lonely, who had\r\nbeen of the party, talking of Lady Bowlwell's deafness, began to tell\r\nwhat had happened; but unluckily, forgetting to say a word of sheep, it\r\nwas understood by the company, and, in every circle, many believed, that\r\nMiss Shepherd of Ramsgate had actually been brought to bed of a fine boy\r\nand a girl; and, in less than a fortnight, there were people who could\r\nname the father, and the farm-house where the babies were put out to\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Ha! ha! well, for a stroke of luck, it was a very good\r\none. I suppose you find no difficulty in spreading the report on the\r\ncensorious Miss ----.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ None in the world,--she has always been so prudent and\r\nreserved, that every body was sure there was some reason for it at\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Yes, a tale of scandal is as fatal to the credit of a\r\nprude as a fever to those of the strongest constitutions; but there is a\r\nsort of sickly reputation that outlives hundreds of the robuster\r\ncharacter of a prude.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ True, ma'am, there are valetudinarians in reputation as in\r\nconstitutions; and both are cautious from their appreciation and\r\nconsciousness of their weak side, and avoid the least breath of air.\r\n[Footnote: This is one of the many instances, where the improving effect\r\nof revision may be traced. The passage at present stands thus:--\"There\r\nare valetudinarians in reputation as well as constitution; who, being\r\nconscious of their weak part, avoid the least breath of air, and supply\r\nthe want of stamina by care and circumspection.\"]\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ But, Spatter, I have something of greater confidence now\r\nto entrust you with. I think I have some claim to your gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ Have I ever shown myself one moment unconscious of what I\r\nowe you?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ I do not charge you with it, but this is an affair of\r\nimportance. You are acquainted with my situation, but not all my\r\nweaknesses. I was hurt, in the early part of my life, by the envenom'd\r\ntongue of scandal, and ever since, I own, have no joy but in sullying\r\nthe fame of others. In this I have found you an apt tool: you have often\r\nbeen the instrument of my revenge, but you must now assist me in a\r\nsofter passion. A young widow with a little beauty and easy fortune is\r\nseldom driven to sue,--yet is that my case. Of the many you have seen\r\nhere, have you ever observed me, secretly, to favor one?\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ Egad! I never was more posed: I'm sure you cannot mean\r\nthat ridiculous old knight, Sir Christopher Crab?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ A wretch! his assiduities are my torment.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ Perhaps his nephew, the baronet, Sir Benjamin Backbite, is\r\nthe happy man?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ No, though he has ill-nature, and a good person on his\r\nside, he is not to my taste. What think you of Clerimont? [Footnote:\r\nAfterwards called Florival.]\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ How! the professed lover of your ward, Maria; between\r\nwhom, too, there is a mutual affection.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Yes, that insensible, that doater on an idiot, is the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ But how can you hope to succeed?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ By poisoning both with jealousy of the other, till the\r\ncredulous fool, in a pique, shall be entangled in my snare.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ Have you taken any measure for it?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ I have. Maria has made me the confidante of Clerimont's\r\nlove for her: in return, I pretended to entrust her with my affection\r\nfor Sir Benjamin, who is her warm admirer. By strong representation of\r\nmy passion, I prevailed on her not to refuse to see Sir Benjamin, which\r\nshe once promised Clerimont to do. I entreated her to plead my cause,\r\nand even drew her in to answer Sir Benjamin's letters with the same\r\nintent. Of this I have made Clerimont suspicious; but 'tis you must\r\ninflame him to the pitch I want.\r\n\r\n\"_Spat._ But will not Maria, on the least unkindness of Clerimont,\r\ninstantly come to an explanation?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ This is what we must prevent by blinding....\"\r\n\r\nThe scene that follows, between Lady Sneerwell and Maria, gives some\r\ninsight into the use that was to be made of this intricate ground-work,\r\n[Footnote: The following is his own arrangement of the Scenes of the\r\nSecond Act. \"Act II. Scene 1st. All.--2d. Lady S. and Mrs. C.--3d. Lady\r\nS. and ... Em. and Mrs. C. listening.--4th. L. S. and Flor. shows him\r\ninto the room,--bids him return the other way.--L. S. and Emma.--Emma\r\nand Florival;--fits,--maid.--Emma fainting and sobbing:--'Death, don't\r\nexpose me!'--enter maid,--will call out--all come on with cards and\r\nsmelling bottles.\"] and it was, no doubt, the difficulty of managing\r\nsuch an involvement of his personages dramatically, that drove him,\r\nluckily for the world, to the construction of a simpler, and, at the\r\nsame time, more comprehensive plan. He might also, possibly, have been\r\ninfluenced by the consideration, that the chief movement of this plot\r\nmust depend upon the jealousy of the lover,--a spring of interest which\r\nhe had already brought sufficiently into play in the Rivals.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady Sneerwell._ Well, my love, have you seen Clerimont to-day?\r\n\r\n\"_Maria._ I have not, nor does he come as often as he used. Indeed,\r\nmadam, I fear what I have done to serve you has by some means come to\r\nhis knowledge, and injured me in his opinion. I promised him faithfully\r\nnever to see Sir Benjamin. What confidence can he ever have in me, if he\r\nonce finds I have broken my word to him?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Nay, you are too grave. If he should suspect any thing,\r\nit will always be in my power to undeceive him.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Well, you have involved me in deceit, and I must trust to\r\nyou to extricate me.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Have you answered Sir Benjamin's last letter in the\r\nmanner I wished?\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ I have written exactly as you desired me: but I wish you\r\nwould give me leave to tell the whole truth to Clerimont at once. There\r\nis a coldness in his manner of late, which I can no ways account for.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ (_aside_.) I'm glad to find I have worked on him so\r\nfar;--fie, Maria, have you so little regard for me? would you put me to\r\nthe shame of being known to love a man who disregards me? Had you\r\nentrusted me with such a secret, not a husband's power should have\r\nforced it from me. But, do as you please. Go, forget the affection I\r\nhave shown you: forget that I have been as a mother to you, whom I found\r\nan orphan. Go, break through all ties of gratitude, and expose me to the\r\nworld's derision, to avoid one sullen hour from a moody lover.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Indeed, madam, you wrong me; and you who know the\r\napprehension of love, should make allowance for its weakness. My love\r\nfor Clerimont is so great--\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Peace; it cannot exceed mine.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ For Sir Benjamin, perhaps not, ma'am--and, I am sure,\r\nClerimont has as sincere an affection for me.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Would to heaven I could say the same!\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Of Sir Benjamin:--I wish so too, ma'am. But I am sure you\r\nwould be extremely hurt, if, in gaining your wishes, you were to injure\r\nme in the opinion of Clerimont.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Undoubtedly; I would not for the world--Simple fool!\r\n(_aside._) But my wishes, my happiness depend on you--for, I doat\r\nso on the insensible, that it kills me to see him so attached to you.\r\nGive me but Clerimont, and--\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Clerimont!\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Sir Benjamin, you know, I meant. Is he not attached to\r\nyou? am I not slighted for you? Yet, do I bear any enmity to you, as my\r\nrival? I only request your friendly intercession, and you are so\r\nungrateful, you would deny me that.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Nay, madam, have I not done everything you wished? For you,\r\nI have departed from truth, and contaminated my mind with falsehood--\r\nwhat could I do more to serve you?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Well, forgive me, I was too warm. I know you would not\r\nbetray me. I expect Sir Benjamin and his uncle this morning--why, Maria,\r\ndo you always leave our little parties?\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ I own, madam, I have no pleasure in their conversation. I\r\nhave myself no gratification in uttering detraction, and therefore none\r\nin hearing it.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Oh fie, you are serious--'tis only a little harmless\r\nraillery.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ I never can think that harmless which hurts the peace of\r\nyouth, draws tears from beauty, and gives many a pang to the innocent.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Nay, you must allow that many people of sense and wit\r\nhave this foible--Sir Benjamin Backbite, for instance.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ He may, but I confess I never can perceive wit where I see\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Fie, Maria, you have the most unpolished way of\r\nthinking! It is absolutely impossible to be witty without being a little\r\nill-natured. The malice of a good thing is the barb that makes it stick.\r\nI protest now when I say an ill-natured thing, I have not the least\r\nmalice against the person; and, indeed, it may be of one whom I never\r\nsaw in my life; for I hate to abuse a friend--but I take it for granted,\r\nthey all speak as ill-naturedly of me.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Then you are, very probably, conscious you deserve it--for\r\nmy part, I shall only suppose myself ill-spoken of, when I am conscious\r\nI deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Enter Servant._\r\n\r\n\"_Ser._ Mrs. Candor.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Well, I'll leave you.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ No, no, you have no reason to avoid her, she is good\r\nnature itself.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Yes, with an artful affectation of candor, she does more\r\ninjury than the worst backbiter of them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ MRS. CANDOR.\r\n\r\n\"_Mrs. Cand._ So, Lady Sneerwell, how d'ye do? Maria, child, how\r\ndost? Well, who is't you are to marry at last? Sir Benjamin or\r\nClerimont? The town talks of nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the remainder of this scene the only difference in the speeches\r\nof Mrs. Candor is, that they abound more than at present in ludicrous\r\nnames and anecdotes, and occasionally straggle into that loose\r\nwordiness, which, knowing how much it weakens the sap of wit, the good\r\ntaste of Sheridan was always sure to lop away. The same may be said of\r\nthe greater part of that scene of scandal which at present occurs in the\r\nsecond Act, and in which all that is now spoken by Lady Teazle, was\r\noriginally put into the mouths of Sir Christopher Crab and others--the\r\ncaustic remarks of Sir Peter Teazle being, as well as himself, an after\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly, however, in Clerimont, the embryo of Charles Surface,\r\nthat we perceive how imperfect may be the first lineaments, that Time\r\nand Taste contrive to mould gradually into beauty. The following is the\r\nscene that introduces him to the audience, and no one ought to be\r\ndisheartened by the failure of a first attempt after reading it. The\r\nspiritless language--the awkward introduction of the sister into the\r\nplot--the antiquated expedient [Footnote: This objection seems to have\r\noccurred to himself; for one of his memorandums is--\"Not to drop the\r\nletter, but take it from the maid.] of dropping the letter--all, in\r\nshort, is of the most undramatic and most unpromising description, and\r\nas little like what it afterwards turned to as the block is to the\r\nstatue, or the grub to the butterfly.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir C._ This Clerimont is, to be sure, the drollest mortal! he is\r\none of your moral fellows, who does unto others as he would they should\r\ndo unto him.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady Sneer._ Yet he is sometimes entertaining.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir C._ Oh hang him, no--he has too much good nature to say a\r\nwitty thing himself, and is too ill-natured to praise wit in others.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ CLERIMONT.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ So, Clerimont--we were just wishing for you to enliven us\r\nwith your wit and agreeable vein.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ No, Sir Benjamin, I cannot join you.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Why, man, you look as grave as a young lover the first\r\ntime he is jilted.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ I have some cause to be grave, Sir Benjamin. A word with\r\nyou all. I have just received a letter from the country, in which I\r\nunderstand that my sister has suddenly left my uncle's house, and has\r\nnot since been heard of.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Indeed! and on what provocation?\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ It seems they were urging her a little too hastily to\r\nmarry some country squire that was not to her taste.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Positively I love her for her spirit.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ And so do I, and would protect her, if I knew where she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ Sir Benjamin, a word with you--(_takes him apart_.) I\r\nthink, sir, we have lived for some years on what the world calls the\r\nfooting of friends.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ To my great honor, sir.--Well, my dear friend?\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ You know that you once paid your addresses to my sister.\r\nMy uncle disliked you; but I have reason to think you were not\r\nindifferent to her.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ I believe you are pretty right there; but what follows?\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ Then I think I have a right to expect an implicit answer\r\nfrom you, whether you are in any respect privy to her elopement?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Why, you certainly have a right to ask the question, and\r\nI will answer you as sincerely--which is, that though I make no doubt\r\nbut that she would have gone with me to the world's end, I am at present\r\nentirely ignorant of the whole affair. This I declare to you upon my\r\nhonor--and, what is more, I assure you my devotions are at present paid\r\nto another lady--one of your acquaintance, too.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ (_Aside_.) Now, who can this other be whom he alludes\r\nto?--I have sometimes thought I perceived a kind of mystery between him\r\nand Maria--but I rely on her promise, though, of late, her conduct to me\r\nhas been strangely reserved.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Why, Clerimont, you seem quite thoughtful. Come with us;\r\nwe are going to kill an hour at ombre--your mistress will join us.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ Madam, I attend you.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S. (Taking Sir B. aside.)_ Sir Benjamin, I see Maria is now\r\ncoming to join us--do you detain her awhile, and I will contrive that\r\nClerimont should see you, and then drop this letter.\r\n\r\n\"[Exeunt all but Sir. B.]\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ MARIA.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ I thought the company were here, and Clerimont--\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ One, more your slave than Clerimont, is here.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Dear Sir Benjamin, I thought you promised me to drop this\r\nsubject. If I have really any power over you, you will oblige me--\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Power over me! What is there you could not command me in?\r\nHave you not wrought on me to proffer my love to Lady Sneerwell? Yet\r\nthough you gain this from me, you will not give me the smallest token of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Enter CLERIMONT behind.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ How can I believe your love sincere, when you continue\r\nstill to importune me?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ I ask but for your friendship, your esteem.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ That you shall ever be entitled to--then I may depend upon\r\nyour honor?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Eternally--dispose of my heart as you please.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Depend upon it, I shall study nothing but its happiness. I\r\nneed not repeat my caution as to Clerimont?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ No, no, he suspects nothing as yet.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ For, within these few days, I almost believed that he\r\nsuspects me.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir B._ Never fear, he does not love well enough to be quick\r\nsighted; for just now he taxed me with eloping with his sister.\r\n\r\n\"_Mar._ Well, we had now best join the company.\r\n\r\n\"[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ So, now--who can ever have faith in woman! D--d deceitful\r\nwanton! why did she not fairly tell me that she was weary of my\r\naddresses? that, woman-like, her mind was changed, and another fool\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ LADY SNEERWELL.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ Clerimont, why do you leave us? Think of my losing this\r\nhand. (_Cler._ She has no heart)--five mate--(_Cler._\r\nDeceitful wanton!) spadille.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ Oh yes, ma'am--'twas very hard.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ But you seem disturbed; and where are Maria and Sir\r\nBenjamin? I vow I shall be jealous of Sir Benjamin.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ I dare swear they are together very happy,--but, Lady\r\nSneerwell--you may perhaps often have perceived that I am discontented\r\nwith Maria. I ask you to tell me sincerely--have you ever perceived it?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady S._ I wish you would excuse me.\r\n\r\n\"_Cler._ Nay, you have perceived it--I know you hate deceit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have said that the other sketch, in which Sir Peter and Lady Teazle\r\nare made the leading personages, was written subsequently to that of\r\nwhich I have just given specimens. Of this, however, I cannot produce\r\nany positive proof. There is no date on the manuscripts, nor any other\r\ncertain clue, to assist in deciding the precedency of time between them.\r\nIn addition to this, the two plans are entirely distinct,--Lady\r\nSneerwell and her associates being as wholly excluded from the one, as\r\nSir Peter and Lady Teazle are from the other; so that it is difficult to\r\nsay, with certainty, which existed first, or at what time the happy\r\nthought occurred of blending all that was best in each into one.\r\n\r\nThe following are the Dramatis Personae of the second plan:--\r\n\r\nSir Rowland Harpur.\r\n\r\n---- Plausible.\r\n\r\nCapt. Harry Plausible.\r\n\r\nFreeman.\r\n\r\nOld Teazle. [Footnote: The first intention was, as appears from his\r\nintroductory speech, to give Old Teazle the Christian name of Solomon.\r\nSheridan was, indeed, most fastidiously changeful in his names. The\r\npresent Charles Surface was at first Clerimont, then Florival, then\r\nCaptain Harry Plausible, then Harry Pliant or Pliable, then Young\r\nHarrier, and then Frank--while his elder brother was successively\r\nPlausible, Pliable, Young Pliant, Tom, and, lastly, Joseph Surface. Trip\r\nwas originally called Spunge; the name of Snake was in the earlier\r\nsketch Spatter, and, even after the union of the two plots into one, all\r\nthe business of the opening scene with Lady Sneerwell, at present\r\ntransacted by Snake, was given to a character, afterwards wholly\r\nomitted, Miss Verjuice.] (_Left off trade_.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Teazle.\r\n\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nFrom this list of the personages we may conclude that the quarrels of\r\nOld Teazle and his wife, the attachment between Maria and one of the\r\nPlausibles, and the intrigue of Mrs. Teazle with the other, formed the\r\nsole materials of the piece, as then constructed. [Footnote: This was\r\nmost probably the \"two act Comedy,\" which he announced to Mr. Linley as\r\npreparing for representation in 1775.] There is reason too to believe,\r\nfrom the following memorandum, which occurs in various shapes through\r\nthese manuscripts, that the device of the screen was not yet thought of,\r\nand that the discovery was to be effected in a very different manner--\r\n\r\n\"Making love to aunt and niece--meeting wrong in the dark--some one\r\ncoming--locks up the aunt, thinking it to be the niece.\"\r\n\r\nI shall now give a scene or two from the Second Sketch--which shows,\r\nperhaps, even more strikingly than the other, the volatilizing and\r\ncondensing process which his wit must have gone through, before it\r\nattained its present proof and flavor.\r\n\r\n\"ACT I.--SCENE I\r\n\r\n\"OLD TEAZLE _alone._\r\n\r\n\"In the year 44 I married my first wife; the wedding was at the end of\r\nthe year--aye, 'twas in December; yet, before Ann. Dom. 45, I repented.\r\nA month before we swore we preferred each other to the whole world--\r\nperhaps we spoke truth; but, when we came to promise to love each other\r\ntill death, there I am sure we lied. Well, Fortune owed me a good turn;\r\nin 48 she died. Ah, silly Solomon, in 52 I find thee married again!\r\nHere, too, is a catalogue of ills--Thomas, born February 12; Jane born\r\nJan. 6; so they go on to the number of five. However, by death I stand\r\ncredited but by one. Well, Margery, rest her soul! was a queer creature;\r\nwhen she was gone, I felt awkward at first, and being sensible that\r\nwishes availed nothing, I often wished for her return. For ten years\r\nmore I kept my senses and lived single. Oh, blockhead, dolt Solomon!\r\nWithin this twelvemonth thou art married again--married to a woman\r\nthirty years younger than thyself; a fashionable woman. Yet I took her\r\nwith caution; she had been educated in the country; but now she has more\r\nextravagance than the daughter of an earl, more levity than a Countess.\r\nWhat a defect it is in our laws, that a man who has once been branded in\r\nthe forehead should be hanged for the second offence.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ JARVIS.\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ Who's there? Well, Jarvis?\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ Sir, there are a number of my mistress's tradesmen\r\nwithout, clamorous for their money.\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ Are those their bills in your hand?\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ Something about a twentieth part, Sir.\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ What! have you expended the hundred pounds I gave you for\r\nher use?\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ Long ago, Sir, as you may judge by some of the items:--\r\n'Paid the coach-maker for lowering the front seat of the coach.'\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ What the deuce was the matter with the seat?\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ Oh Lord, the carriage was too low for her by a foot when\r\nshe was dressed--so that it must have been so, or have had a tub at top\r\nlike a hat-case on a travelling trunk. Well, Sir, (_reads._) 'Paid\r\nher two footmen half a year's wages, 50_l_.'\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ 'Sdeath and fury! does she give her footmen a hundred a\r\nyear?\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ Yes, Sir, and I think, indeed, she has rather made a good\r\nbargain, for they find their own bags and bouquets.\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ Bags and bouquets for footmen!--halters and bastinadoes!\r\n[Footnote: Transferred afterwards to Trip and Sir Oliver.]\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ 'Paid for my lady's own nosegays, 50_l_.'\r\n\r\n\"_Teaz._ Fifty pounds for flowers! enough to turn the Pantheon into\r\na green-house, and give a Fete Champetre at Christmas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: We observe here a change in his plan, with respect both to\r\nthe titles of Old Teazle and his wife, and the presence of the latter\r\nduring this scene, which was evidently not at first intended.\r\n\r\nFrom the following skeleton of the scenes of this piece it would appear\r\nthat (inconsistently, in some degree, with my notion of its being the\r\ntwo act Comedy announced in 1775) he had an idea of extending the plot\r\nthrough five acts.\r\n\r\n\"Act 1st, Scene 1st, Sir Peter and Steward--2d, Sir P. and Lady--then\r\nYoung Pliable.\r\n\r\n\"Act 2d, Sir P. and Lady--Young Harrier--Sir P. and Sir Rowland, and Old\r\nJeremy--Sir R. and Daughter--Y.

I am sure I wish with all my heart, that it was Spring all\r\nthe year round, and that roses grew under one's feet.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Nay, but, madam, then you would not wear them; but try\r\nsnowballs and icicles. But tell me, madam, how can you feel any\r\nsatisfaction in wearing these, when you might reflect that one of the\r\nrose-buds would have furnished a poor family with a dinner?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Upon my word, Sir Peter, begging your pardon, that is a\r\nvery absurd way of arguing. By that rule, why do you indulge in the\r\nleast superfluity? I dare swear a beggar might dine tolerably on your\r\ngreat-coat, or sup off your laced waistcoat--nay, I dare say, he\r\nwouldn't eat your gold-headed cane in a week. Indeed, if you would\r\nreserve nothing but necessaries, you should give the first poor man you\r\nmeet your wig, and walk the streets in your night-cap, which, you know,\r\nbecomes you very much.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Well, go on to the articles.\r\n\r\n\"_Jarv._ (_Reading._) 'Fruit for my lady's monkey, 5_l._\r\nper week.'\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Five pounds for a monkey!--why 'tis a dessert for an\r\nalderman!\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Why, Sir Peter, would you starve the poor animal?

Well, heaven forgive my\r\nmother, but I do believe my father must have been a man of quality.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Yes, madam, when first I saw you, you were dressed in a\r\npretty figured linen gown, with a bunch of keys by your side; your\r\noccupations, madam, to superintend the poultry; your accomplishments, a\r\ncomplete knowledge of the family receipt-book--then you sat in a room\r\nhung round with fruit in worsted of your own working; your amusements\r\nwere to play country-dances on an old spinnet to your father while he\r\nwent asleep after a fox-chase--to read Tillotson's sermons to your aunt\r\nDeborah. These, madam, were your recreations, and these the\r\naccomplishments that captivated me. Now, forsooth, you must have two\r\nfootmen to your chair, and a pair of white dogs in a phaeton; you forget\r\nwhen you used to ride double behind the butler on a docked bay coach-\r\nhorse.... Now you must have a French hair-dresser; do you think you did\r\nnot look as well when you had your hair combed smooth over a roller?....\r\nThen you could be content to sit with me, or walk by the side of the--\r\nHa! Ha!\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ True, I did; and, when you asked me if I could love an\r\nold fellow, who would deny me nothing, I simpered and said 'Till death.'\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Why did you say so?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Shall I tell you the truth?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ If it is not too great a favor.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Why, then, the truth is, I was heartily tired of all\r\nthese agreeable recreations you have so well remembered, and having a\r\nspirit to spend and enjoy fortune, I was determined to marry the first\r\nfool I should meet with.... you made me a wife, for which I am much\r\nobliged to you, and if you have a wish to make me more grateful still,\r\nmake me a widow.\" [Footnote: The speeches which I have omitted consist\r\nmerely of repetitions of the same thoughts, with but very little\r\nvariation of the language.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Then, you never had a desire to please me, or add to my\r\nhappiness?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Sincerely, I never thought about you; did you imagine\r\nthat age was catching?

Here am I surrounded by half a hundred lovers, not one of\r\nwhom but would buy a single smile by a thousand such baubles as you\r\ngrudge me.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Then you wish me dead?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ You know I do not, for you have made no settlement on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ I am but middle-aged.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ There's the misfortune; put yourself on, or back, twenty\r\nyears, and either way I should like you the better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, sir, and then your behavior too was different; you would dress, and\r\nsmile, and bow; fly to fetch me anything I wanted; praise every thing I\r\ndid or said; fatigue your stiff face with an eternal grin; nay, you even\r\ncommitted poetry, and muffled your harsh tones into a lover's whisper to\r\nsing it yourself, so that even my mother said you were the smartest old\r\nbachelor she ever saw--a billet-doux engrossed on buckram!!!!!!\r\n[Footnote: These notes of admiration are in the original, and seem meant\r\nto express the surprise of the author at the extravagance of his own\r\njoke.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet girls take my advice and never marry an old bachelor. He must be so\r\neither because he could find nothing to love in women, or because women\r\ncould find nothing to love in him.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this dialogue is evidently _experimental_, and\r\nthe play of repartee protracted with no other view, than to take the\r\nchance of a trump of wit or humor turning up.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the two characters in this sketch with what they are at\r\npresent, it is impossible not to be struck by the signal change that\r\nthey have undergone. The transformation of Sir Peter into a gentleman\r\nhas refined, without weakening, the ridicule of his situation; and there\r\nis an interest created by the respectability, and amiableness of his\r\nsentiments, which, contrary to the effect produced in general by elderly\r\ngentlemen so circumstanced, makes us rejoice, at the end, that he has\r\nhis young wife all to himself. The improvement in the character of Lady\r\nTeazle is still more marked and successful. Instead of an ill-bred young\r\nshrew, whose readiness to do wrong leaves the mind in but little\r\nuncertainty as to her fate, we have a lively and innocent, though\r\nimprudent country girl, transplanted into the midst of all that can\r\nbewilder and endanger her, but with still enough of the purity of rural\r\nlife about her heart, to keep the blight of the world from settling upon\r\nit permanently.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed in the original draught a degree of glare and\r\ncoarseness, which proves the eye of the artist to have been fresh from\r\nthe study of Wycherly and Vanbrugh; and this want of delicacy is\r\nparticularly observable in the subsequent scene between Lady Teazle and\r\nSurface--the chastening down of which to its present tone is not the\r\nleast of those triumphs of taste and skill, which every step in the\r\nelaboration of this Comedy exhibits.\r\n\r\n\"_Scene_ [Footnote: The Third of the fourth Act in the present form\r\nof the Comedy. This scene underwent many changes afterwards, and was\r\noftener put back into the crucible than any other part of the play]\r\nYOUNG PLIANT'S _Room_.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ I wonder her ladyship is not here: she promised me to\r\ncall this morning. I have a hard game to play here, to pursue my designs\r\non Maria. I have brought myself into a scrape with the mother-in-law.\r\nHowever, I think we have taken care to ruin my brother's character with\r\nmy uncle, should he come to-morrow. Frank has not an ill quality in his\r\nnature; yet, a neglect of forms, and of the opinion of the world, has\r\nhurt him in the estimation of all his graver friends. I have profited by\r\nhis errors, and contrived to gain a character, which now serves me as a\r\nmask to lie under.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ LADY TEAZLE.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ What, musing, or thinking of me?\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ I was thinking unkindly of you; do you know now that\r\nyou must repay me for this delay, or I must be coaxed into good humor?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Nay, in faith you should pity me--this old curmudgeon of\r\nlate is growing so jealous, that I dare scarce go out, till I know he is\r\nsecure for some time.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ I am afraid the insinuations we have had spread about\r\nFrank have operated too strongly on him--we meant only to direct his\r\nsuspicions to a wrong object.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Oh, hang him! I have told him plainly that if he\r\ncontinues to be so suspicious, I'll leave him entirely, and make him\r\nallow me a separate maintenance.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ But, my charmer, if ever that should be the case, you\r\nsee before you the man who will ever be attached to you. But you must\r\nnot let matters come to extremities; you can never be revenged so well\r\nby leaving him, as by living with him, and let my sincere affection make\r\namends for his brutality.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ But how shall I be sure now that you are sincere? I have\r\nsometimes suspected that you loved my niece. [Footnote: He had not yet\r\ndecided whether to make Maria the daughter-in-law or niece of Lady\r\nTeazle.]\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ Oh, hang her, a puling idiot, without sense or spirit.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ But what proofs have I of your love to me, for I have\r\nstill so much of my country prejudices left, that if I were to do a\r\nfoolish thing (and I think I can't promise) it shall be for a man who\r\nwould risk every thing for me alone. How shall I be sure you love me?\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ I have dreamed of you every night this week past.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ That's a sign you have slept every night for this week\r\npast; for my part, I would not give a pin for a lover who could not wake\r\nfor a month in absence.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ I have written verses on you out of number.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ I never saw any.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ No--they did not please me, and so I tore them.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Then it seems you wrote them only to divert yourself.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ Am I doomed for ever to suspense?\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ I don't know--if I was convinced--\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ Then let me on my knees--\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Nay, nay, I will have no raptures either. This much I\r\ncan tell you, that if I am to be seduced to do wrong, I am not to be\r\ntaken by storm, but by deliberate capitulation, and that only where my\r\nreason or my heart is convinced.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ Then, to say it at once--the world gives itself\r\nliberties--\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Nay, I am sure without cause; for I am as yet\r\nunconscious of any ill, though I know not what I may be forced to.\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ The fact is, my dear Lady Teazle, that your extreme\r\ninnocence is the very cause of your danger; it is the integrity of your\r\nheart that makes you run into a thousand imprudences which a full\r\nconsciousness of error would make you guard against. Now, in that case,\r\nyou can't conceive how much more circumspect you would be.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ Do you think so?\r\n\r\n\"_Young P._ Most certainly. Your character is like a person in a\r\nplethora, absolutely dying of too much health.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady T._ So then you would have me sin in my own defence, and\r\npart with my virtue to preserve my reputation. [Footnote: This sentence\r\nseems to have haunted him--I find it written in every direction, and\r\nwithout any material change in its form, over the pages of his different\r\nmemorandum books.]\r\n\r\n\"_Young P. Exactly so, upon my credit, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, from all I have cited, that much of the original\r\nmaterial is still preserved throughout; but that, like the ivory melting\r\nin the hands of Pygmalion, it has lost all its first rigidity and\r\nroughness, and, assuming at every touch some variety of aspect, seems to\r\nhave gained new grace by every change.\r\n\r\n  \"_Mollescit ebur, positoque rigore\r\n  Subsidit digitis, ceditque ut Hymettia sole\r\n  Cera remollescit, tractataque pollice multas\r\n  Flectitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu._\"\r\n\r\n  Where'er his fingers move his eye can trace\r\n  The once rude ivory softening into grace--\r\n  Pliant as wax that, on Hymettus' hill,\r\n  Melts in the sunbeam, it obeys his skill;\r\n  At every touch some different aspect shows,\r\n  And still, the oftener touch'd the lovelier grows.\r\n\r\nI need not, I think, apologize for the length of the extracts I have\r\ngiven, as they cannot be otherwise than interesting to all lovers of\r\nliterary history. To trace even the mechanism of an author's style\r\nthrough the erasures and alterations of his rough copy, is, in itself,\r\nno ordinary gratification of curiosity; and the _brouillon_ of\r\nRousseau's Heloise, in the library of the Chamber of Deputies at Paris,\r\naffords a study in which more than the mere \"auceps syllabarum\" might\r\ndelight. But it is still more interesting to follow thus the course of a\r\nwriter's thoughts--to watch the kindling of new fancies as he goes--to\r\naccompany him in his change of plans, and see the various vistas that\r\nopen upon him at every step. It is, indeed, like being admitted by some\r\nmagical power, to witness the mysterious processes of the natural world\r\n--to see the crystal forming by degrees round its primitive nucleus, or\r\nobserve the slow ripening of\r\n\r\n                     \"the imperfect ore,\r\n  And know it will be gold another day!\"\r\n\r\nIn respect of mere style, too, the workmanship of so pure a writer of\r\nEnglish as Sheridan is well worth the attention of all who would learn\r\nthe difficult art of combining ease with polish, and being, at the same\r\ntime, idiomatic and elegant. There is not a page of these manuscripts\r\nthat does not bear testimony to the fastidious care with which he\r\nselected, arranged, and moulded his language, so as to form it into that\r\ntransparent channel of his thoughts, which it is at present.\r\n\r\nHis chief objects in correcting were to condense and simplify--to get\r\nrid of all unnecessary phrases and epithets, and, in short, to strip\r\naway from the thyrsus of his wit every leaf that could render it less\r\nlight and portable. One instance out of many will show the improving\r\neffect of these operations. [Footnote: In one or two sentences he has\r\nleft a degree of stiffness in the style, not so much from inadvertence\r\nas from the sacrifice of ease to point. Thus, in the following example,\r\nhe has been tempted by an antithesis into an inversion of phrase by no\r\nmeans idiomatic. \"The plain state of the matter is this--I am an\r\nextravagant young fellow _who want money to borrow_; you, I take to\r\nbe a prudent old fellow who have got money to lend.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Collection of his Works this phrase is given differently--but\r\nwithout authority from any of the manuscript copies.] The following is\r\nthe original form of a speech of Sir Peter's:--\r\n\r\n\"People who utter a tale of scandal, knowing it to be forged, deserve\r\nthe pillory more than for a forged bank-note. They can't pass the lie\r\nwithout putting their names on the back of it. You say no person has a\r\nright to come on you because you didn't invent it; but you should know\r\nthat, if the drawer of the lie is out of the way, the injured party has\r\na right to come on any of the indorsers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this is compared with the form in which the same thought is put at\r\npresent, it will be perceived how much the wit has gained in lightness\r\nand effect by the change:--\r\n\r\n\"_Mrs. Candor._ But sure you would not be quite so severe on those\r\nwho only report what they hear?\r\n\r\n\"_Sir P._ Yes, madam, I would have Law-merchant for them too, and\r\nin all cases of slander currency, [Footnote: There is another simile\r\namong his memorandums of the same mercantile kind:--\"A sort of broker in\r\nscandal, who transfers lies without fees.\"] whenever the drawer of the\r\nlie was not to be found, the injured party should have a right to come\r\non any of the indorsers.\"\r\n\r\nAnother great source of the felicities of his style, and to which he\r\nattended most anxiously in revision, was the choice of epithets; in\r\nwhich he has the happy art of making these accessary words not only\r\nminister to the clearness of his meaning, but bring out new effects in\r\nhis wit by the collateral lights which they strike upon it--and even\r\nwhere the principal idea has but little significance, he contrives to\r\nenliven it into point by the quaintness or contrast of his epithets.\r\n\r\nAmong the many rejected scraps of dialogue that lie about, like the\r\nchippings of a Phidias, in this workshop of wit, there are some precious\r\nenough to be preserved, at least, as relics. For instance,--\"She is one\r\nof those, who convey a libel in a frown, and wink a reputation down.\"\r\nThe following touch of costume, too, in Sir Peter's description of the\r\nrustic dress of Lady Teazle before he married her:--\"You forget when a\r\nlittle wire and gauze, with a few beads, made you a fly-cap not much\r\nbigger than a blue-bottle.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimen which Sir Benjamin Backbite gives of his poetical talents\r\nwas taken, it will be seen, from the following verses, which I find in\r\nMr. Sheridan's hand-writing--one of those trifles, perhaps, with which\r\nhe and his friend Tickell were in the constant habit of amusing\r\nthemselves, and written apparently with the intention of ridiculing some\r\nwoman of fashion:--\r\n\r\n  \"Then behind, all my hair is done up in a plat,\r\n  And so, like a cornet's, tuck'd under my hat.\r\n  Then I mount on my palfrey as gay as a lark,\r\n  And, follow'd by John, take the dust in High Park.\r\n[Footnote: This phrase is made use of in the dialogue:--\"As Lady Betty\r\nCurricle was taking the dust in Hyde Park.\"]\r\n\r\n  In the way I am met by some smart macaroni,\r\n  Who rides by my side on a little bay poney--\r\n  No sturdy Hibernian, with shoulders so wide,\r\n  But as taper and slim as the ponies they ride;\r\n  Their legs are as slim, and their shoulders no wider,\r\n  Dear sweet little creatures, both poney and rider!\r\n\r\n  But sometimes, when hotter, I order my chaise,\r\n  And manage, myself, my two little grays.\r\n  Sure never were seen two such sweet little ponies,\r\n  Other horses are clowns, and these macaronies,\r\n  And to give them this title, I'm sure isn't wrong,\r\n  Their legs are so slim, and their tails are so long.\r\n\r\n  In Kensington Gardens to stroll up and down,\r\n  You know was the fashion before you left town,--\r\n  The thing's well enough, when allowance is made\r\n  For the size of the trees and the depth of the shade,\r\n  But the spread of their leaves such a shelter affords\r\n  To those noisy, impertinent creatures called birds,\r\n  Whose ridiculous chirruping ruins the scene,\r\n  Brings the country before me, and gives me the spleen.\r\n\r\n  Yet, tho' 'tis too rural--to come near the mark,\r\n  We all herd in _one_ walk, and that, nearest the Park,\r\n  There with ease we may see, as we pass by the wicket,\r\n  The chimneys of Knightsbridge and--footmen at cricket.\r\n  I must tho', in justice, declare that the grass,\r\n  Which, worn by our feet, is diminished apace,\r\n  In a little time more will be brown and as flat\r\n  As the sand at Vauxhall or as Ranelagh mat.\r\n  Improving thus fast, perhaps, by degrees,\r\n  We may see rolls and butter spread under the trees,\r\n  With a small pretty band in each seat of the walk,\r\n  To play little tunes and enliven our talk.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Sheridan appears to have made more easy progress, after he\r\nhad incorporated his two first plots into one, yet, even in the details\r\nof the new plan, considerable alterations were subsequently made--whole\r\nscenes suppressed or transposed, and the dialogue of some entirely re-\r\nwritten. In the third Act, for instance, as it originally stood, there\r\nwas a long scene, in which Rowley, by a minute examination of Snake,\r\ndrew from him, in the presence of Sir Oliver and Sir Peter, a full\r\nconfession of his designs against the reputation of Lady Teazle. Nothing\r\ncould be more ill-placed and heavy; it was accordingly cancelled, and\r\nthe confession of Snake postponed to its natural situation, the\r\nconclusion. The scene, too, where Sir Oliver, as Old Stanley, comes to\r\nask pecuniary aid of Joseph, was at first wholly different from what it\r\nis at present; and in some parts approached much nearer to the confines\r\nof caricature than the watchful taste of Mr. Sheridan would permit. For\r\nexample, Joseph is represented in it as giving the old suitor only half-\r\na-guinea, which the latter indignantly returns, and leaves him; upon\r\nwhich Joseph, looking at the half-guinea, exclaims, \"Well, let him\r\nstarve--this will do for the opera.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the fate of Mr. Sheridan, through life,--and, in a great degree,\r\nperhaps, his policy,--to gain credit for excessive indolence and\r\ncarelessness, while few persons, with so much natural brilliancy of\r\ntalents, ever employed more art and circumspection in their display.\r\nThis was the case, remarkably, in the instance before us.\r\nNotwithstanding the labor which he bestowed upon this comedy, (or we\r\nshould rather, perhaps, say in consequence of that labor,) the first\r\nrepresentation of the piece was announced before the whole of the copy\r\nwas in the hands of the actors. The manuscript, indeed, of the five last\r\nscenes bears evident marks of this haste in finishing,--there being but\r\none rough draught of them scribbled upon detached pieces of paper;\r\nwhile, of all the preceding acts, there are numerous transcripts,\r\nscattered promiscuously through six or seven books, with new\r\ninterlineations and memorandums to each. On the last leaf of all, which\r\nexists just as we may suppose it to have been despatched by him to the\r\ncopyist, there is the following curious specimen of doxology, written\r\nhastily, in the hand-writing of the respective parties, at the bottom:--\r\n\r\n\"Finished at last.

A gentleman who is as mad as myself about ye\r\nSchool remark'd, that the characters upon the stage at ye falling of the\r\nscreen stand too long before they speak;--I thought so too ye first\r\nnight:--he said it was the same on ye 2nd, and was remark'd by others;--\r\ntho' they should be astonish'd, and a little petrify'd, yet it may be\r\ncarry'd to too great a length.--All praise at Lord Lucan's last night.\"\r\n\r\nThe beauties of this Comedy are so universally known and felt, that\r\ncriticism may be spared the trouble of dwelling upon them very minutely.\r\nWith but little interest in the plot, with no very profound or ingenious\r\ndevelopment of character, and with a group of personages, not one of\r\nwhom has any legitimate claims upon either our affection or esteem, it\r\nyet, by the admirable skill with which its materials are managed,--the\r\nhappy contrivance of the situations, at once both natural and striking,\r\n--the fine feeling of the ridiculous that smiles throughout, and that\r\nperpetual play of wit which never tires, but seems, like running water,\r\nto be kept fresh by its own flow,--by all this general animation and\r\neffect, combined with a finish of the details almost faultless, it\r\nunites the suffrages, at once, of the refined and the simple, and is not\r\nless successful in ministering to the natural enjoyment of the latter,\r\nthan in satisfying and delighting the most fastidious tastes among the\r\nformer. And this is the true triumph of genius in all the arts,--whether\r\nin painting, sculpture, music, or literature, those works which have\r\npleased the greatest number of people of all classes, for the longest\r\nspace of time, may without hesitation be pronounced the best; and,\r\nhowever mediocrity may enshrine itself in the admiration of the select\r\nfew, the palm of excellence can only be awarded by the many.\r\n\r\nThe defects of The School for Scandal, if they can be allowed to amount\r\nto defects, are, in a great measure, traceable to that amalgamation of\r\ntwo distinct plots, out of which, as I have already shown, the piece was\r\nformed. From this cause,--like an accumulation of wealth from the union\r\nof two rich families,--has devolved that excessive opulence of wit,\r\nwith which, as some critics think, the dialogue is overloaded; and which\r\nMr. Sheridan himself used often to mention, as a fault of which he was\r\nconscious in his work. That he had no such scruple, however, in writing\r\nit, appears evident from the pains which he took to string upon his new\r\nplot every bright thought and fancy which he had brought together for\r\nthe two others; and it is not a little curious, in turning over his\r\nmanuscript, to see how the outstanding jokes are kept in recollection\r\nupon the margin, till he can find some opportunity of funding them to\r\nadvantage in the text. The consequence of all this is, that the\r\ndialogue, from beginning to end, is a continued sparkling of polish and\r\npoint: and the whole of the Dramatis Personae might be comprised under\r\none common designation of Wits. Even Trip, the servant, is as pointed\r\nand shining as the rest, and has his master's wit, as he has his birth-\r\nday clothes, \"with the gloss on.\" [Footnote: This is one of the phrases\r\nthat seem to have perplexed the taste of Sheridan,--and upon so minute a\r\npoint, as, whether it should be \"with the gloss on,\" or, \"with the gloss\r\non them.\" After various trials of it in both ways, he decided, as might\r\nbe expected from his love of idiom, for the former.] The only personage\r\namong them that shows any \"temperance in jesting,\" is old Rowley; and\r\nhe, too, in the original, had his share in the general largess of\r\n_bon-mots_,--one of the liveliest in the piece [Footnote: The\r\nanswer to the remark, that \"charity begins at home,\"--\"and his, I\r\npresume, is of that domestic sort which never stirs abroad at all.\"]\r\nbeing at first given to him, though afterwards transferred, with\r\nsomewhat more fitness, to Sir Oliver. In short, the entire Comedy is a\r\nsort of El-Dorado of wit, where the precious metal is thrown about by\r\nall classes, as carelessly as if they had not the least idea of its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAnother blemish that hypercriticism has noticed, and which may likewise\r\nbe traced to the original conformation of the play, is the uselessness\r\nof some of the characters to the action or business of it--almost the\r\nwhole of the \"Scandalous College\" being but, as it were, excrescences,\r\nthrough which none of the life-blood of the plot circulates. The cause\r\nof this is evident:--Sir Benjamin Backbite, in the first plot to which\r\nhe belonged, was a principal personage; but, being transplanted from\r\nthence into one with which he has no connection, not only he, but his\r\nuncle Crabtree, and Mrs. Candor, though contributing abundantly to the\r\nanimation of the dialogue, have hardly anything to do with the\r\nadvancement of the story; and, like the accessories in a Greek drama,\r\nare but as a sort of Chorus of Scandal throughout. That this defect, or\r\nrather peculiarity, should have been observed at first, when criticism\r\nwas freshly on the watch for food, is easily conceivable; and I have\r\nbeen told by a friend, who was in the pit on the first night of\r\nperformance, that a person, who sat near him, said impatiently, during\r\nthe famous scene at Lady Sneerwell's, in the Second Act,--\"I wish these\r\npeople would have done talking, and let the play begin.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked as singular, that the lovers, Charles and\r\nMaria, should never be brought in presence of each other till the last\r\nscene; and Mr. Sheridan used to say, that he was aware, in writing the\r\nComedy, of the apparent want of dramatic management which such an\r\nomission would betray; but that neither of the actors, for whom he had\r\ndestined those characters, was such as he could safely trust with a love\r\nscene. There might, perhaps, too, have been, in addition to this motive,\r\na little consciousness, on his own part, of not being exactly in his\r\nelement in that tender style of writing, which such a scene, to make it\r\nworthy of the rest, would have required; and of which the specimens left\r\nus in the serious parts of The Rivals are certainly not among his most\r\nfelicitous efforts.\r\n\r\nBy some critics the incident of the screen has been censured, as a\r\ncontrivance unworthy of the dignity of comedy. [Footnote: \"In the old\r\ncomedy, the catastrophe is occasioned, in general, by a change in the\r\nmind of some principal character, artfully prepared and cautiously\r\nconducted;--in the modern, the unfolding of the plot is effected by the\r\noverturning of a screen, the opening of a door, or some other equally\r\ndignified machine.\"--GIFFORD, _Essay on the Writings of\r\nMassinger_.] But in real life, of which comedy must condescend to be\r\nthe copy, events of far greater importance are brought about by\r\naccidents as trivial; and in a world like ours, where the falling of an\r\napple has led to the discovery of the laws of gravitation, it is surely\r\ntoo fastidious to deny to the dramatist the discovery of an intrigue by\r\nthe falling of a screen. There is another objection as to the manner of\r\nemploying this machine, which, though less grave, is perhaps less easily\r\nanswered. Joseph, at the commencement of the scene, desires his servant\r\nto draw the screen before the window, because \"his opposite neighbor is\r\na maiden lady of so anxious a temper;\" yet, afterwards, by placing Lady\r\nTeazle between the screen and the window, he enables this inquisitive\r\nlady to indulge her curiosity at leisure. It might be said, indeed, that\r\nJoseph, with the alternative of exposure to either the husband or\r\nneighbor, chooses the lesser evil;--but the oversight hardly requires a\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nFrom the trifling nature of these objections to the dramatic merits of\r\nthe School for Scandal, it will be seen, that, like the criticism of\r\nMomus on the creaking of Venus's shoes, they only show how perfect must\r\nbe the work in which no greater faults can be found. But a more serious\r\ncharge has been brought against it on the score of morality, and the gay\r\ncharm thrown around the irregularities of Charles is pronounced to be\r\ndangerous to the interests of honesty and virtue. There is no doubt that\r\nin this character only the fairer side of libertinism is presented,--\r\nthat the merits of being in debt are rather too fondly insisted upon,\r\nand with a grace and spirit that might seduce even creditors into\r\nadmiration. It was, indeed, playfully said, that no tradesman who\r\napplauded Charles could possibly have the face to dun the author\r\nafterwards. In looking, however, to the race of rakes that had\r\npreviously held possession of the stage, we cannot help considering our\r\nrelease from the contagion of so much coarseness and selfishness to be\r\nworth even the increased risk of seduction that may have succeeded to\r\nit; and the remark of Burke, however questionable in strict ethics, is,\r\nat least, true on the stage,--that \"vice loses half its evil by losing\r\nall its grossness.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be recollected, too, that, in other respects, the author\r\napplies the lash of moral satire very successfully. That group of\r\nslanderers who, like the Chorus of the Eumenides, go searching about for\r\ntheir prey with \"eyes that drop poison,\" represent a class of persons in\r\nsociety who richly deserve such ridicule, and who--like their prototypes\r\nin Aeschylus trembling before the shafts of Apollo--are here made to\r\nfeel the full force of the archery of wit. It is indeed a proof of the\r\neffect and use of such satire, that the name of \"Mrs. Candor\" has become\r\none of those formidable bye-words, which have more power in putting\r\nfolly and ill-nature out of countenance, than whole volumes of the\r\nwisest remonstrance and reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe poetical justice exercised upon the Tartuffe of sentiment, Joseph,\r\nis another service to the cause of morals, which should more than atone\r\nfor any dangerous embellishment of wrong that the portraiture of the\r\nyounger brother may exhibit. Indeed, though both these characters are\r\nsuch as the moralist must visit with his censure, there can be little\r\ndoubt to which we should, in real life, give the preference;--the\r\nlevities and errors of the one, arising from warmth of heart and of\r\nyouth, may be merely like those mists that exhale from summer streams,\r\nobscuring them awhile to the eye, without affecting the native purity of\r\ntheir waters; while the hypocrisy of the other is like the _mirage_\r\nof the desert, shining with promise on the surface, but all false and\r\nbarren beneath.\r\n\r\nIn a late work, professing to be the Memoirs of Mr. Sheridan, there are\r\nsome wise doubts expressed as to his being really the author of the\r\nSchool for Scandal, to which, except for the purpose of exposing\r\nabsurdity, I should not have thought it worth while to allude. It is an\r\nold trick of Detraction,--and one, of which it never tires,--to father\r\nthe works of eminent writers upon others; or, at least, while it kindly\r\nleaves an author the credit of his worst performances, to find some one\r\nin the background to ease him of the fame of his best. When this sort of\r\ncharge is brought against a cotemporary, the motive is intelligible;\r\nbut, such an abstract pleasure have some persons in merely unsettling\r\nthe crowns of Fame, that a worthy German has written an elaborate book\r\nto prove, that the Iliad was written, not by that particular Homer the\r\nworld supposes, but by some _other_ Homer! Indeed, if mankind were\r\nto be influenced by those _Qui tam_ critics, who have, from time to\r\ntime, in the course of the history of literature, exhibited informations\r\nof plagiarism against great authors, the property of fame would pass\r\nfrom its present holders into the hands of persons with whom the world\r\nis but little acquainted. Aristotle must refund to one Ocellus Lucanus\r\n--Virgil must make a _cessio bonorum_ in favor of Pisander--the\r\nMetamorphoses of Ovid must be credited to the account of Parthenius of\r\nNicaea, and (to come to a modern instance) Mr. Sheridan must, according\r\nto his biographer, Dr. Watkins, surrender the glory of having written\r\nthe School for Scandal to a certain anonymous young lady, who died of a\r\nconsumption in Thames Street!\r\n\r\nTo pass, however, to less hardy assailants of the originality of this\r\ncomedy,--it is said that the characters of Joseph and Charles were\r\nsuggested by those of Blifil and Tom Jones; that the incident of the\r\narrival of Sir Oliver from India is copied from that of the return of\r\nWarner in Sidney Biddulph; and that the hint of the famous scandal scene\r\nat Lady Sneerwell's is borrowed from a comedy of Moliere.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan, it is true, like all men of genius, had, in addition to\r\nthe resources of his own wit, a quick apprehension of what suited his\r\npurpose in the wit of others, and a power of enriching whatever he\r\nadopted from them with such new grace, as gave him a sort of claim of\r\npaternity over it, and made it all his own. \"C'est mon bien,\" said\r\nMoliere, when accused of borrowing, \"et je le reprens partout ou je le\r\ntrouve;\" and next, indeed, to creation, the re-production, in a new and\r\nmore perfect form, of materials already existing, or the full\r\ndevelopment of thoughts that had but half blown in the hands of others,\r\nare the noblest miracles for which we look to the hand of genius. It is\r\nnot my intention therefore to defend Mr. Sheridan from this kind of\r\nplagiarism, of which he was guilty in common with the rest of his\r\nfellow-descendants from Prometheus, who all steal the spark wherever\r\nthey can find it. But the instances, just alleged, of his obligations to\r\nothers, are too questionable and trivial to be taken into any serious\r\naccount. Contrasts of character, such as Charles and Joseph exhibit, are\r\nas common as the lights and shadows of a landscape, and belong neither\r\nto Fielding nor Sheridan, but to nature. It is in the manner of\r\ntransferring them to the canvas that the whole difference between the\r\nmaster and the copyist lies; and Charles and Joseph would, no doubt,\r\nhave been what they are, if Tom Jones had never existed. With respect to\r\nthe hint supposed to be taken from the novel of his mother, he at least\r\nhad a right to consider any aid from that quarter as \"son bien\"--talent\r\nbeing the only patrimony to which he had succeeded. But the use made of\r\nthe return of a relation in the play is wholly different from that to\r\nwhich the same incident is applied in the novel. Besides, in those\r\ngolden times of Indian delinquency, the arrival of a wealthy relative\r\nfrom the East was no very unobvious ingredient in a story.\r\n\r\nThe imitation of Moliere (if, as I take for granted, the Misanthrope be\r\nthe play, in which the origin of the famous scandal scene is said to be\r\nfound) is equally faint and remote, and, except in the common point of\r\nscandal, untraceable. Nothing, indeed, can be more unlike than the\r\nmanner in which the two scenes are managed. Celimene, in Moliere, bears\r\nthe whole _frais_ of the conversation; and this female La Bruyere's\r\ntedious and solitary dissections of character would be as little borne\r\non the English stage, as the quick and dazzling movement of so many\r\nlancets of wit as operate in the School for Scandal would be tolerated\r\non that of the French.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that Mr. Sheridan was a good deal indebted to\r\nWycherley; and he himself gave, in some degree, a color to the charge,\r\nby the suspicious impatience which he betrayed whenever any allusion was\r\nmade to it. He went so far, indeed, it is said, as to deny having ever\r\nread a line of Wycherley (though of Vanbrugh's dialogue he always spoke\r\nwith the warmest admiration);--and this assertion, as well as some\r\nothers equally remarkable, such as, that he never saw Garrick on the\r\nstage, that he never had seen a play throughout in his life, however\r\nstrange and startling they may appear, are, at least, too curious and\r\ncharacteristic not to be put upon record. His acquaintance with\r\nWycherley was possibly but at second-hand, and confined, perhaps, to\r\nGarrick's alteration of the Country Wife, in which the incident, already\r\nmentioned as having been borrowed for the Duenna, is preserved. There\r\nis, however, a scene in the Plain Dealer (Act II.), where Nevil and\r\nOlivia attack the characters of the persons with whom Nevil had dined,\r\nof which it is difficult to believe that Mr. Sheridan was ignorant: as\r\nit seems to contain much of that _Hyle_, or First Matter, out of\r\nwhich his own more perfect creations were formed.\r\n\r\nIn Congreve's Double Dealer, too, (Act III. Scene 10) there is much\r\nwhich may, at least, have mixed itself with the recollections of\r\nSheridan, and influenced the course of his fancy--it being often found\r\nthat the images with which the memory is furnished, like those pictures\r\nhung up before the eyes of pregnant women at Sparta, produce insensibly\r\na likeness to themselves in the offspring which the imagination brings\r\nforth. The admirable drollery in Congreve about Lady Froth's verses on\r\nher coachman--\r\n\r\n  \"For as the sun shines every day,\r\n  So of our coachman I may say\"--\r\n\r\nis by no means unlikely to have suggested the doggerel of Sir Benjamin\r\nBackbite; and the scandalous conversation in this scene, though far\r\ninferior in delicacy and ingenuity to that of Sheridan, has somewhat, as\r\nthe reader will see, of a parental resemblance to it:--\r\n\r\n\"_Lord Froth._ Hee, hee, my dear; have you done? Won't you join\r\nwith us? We were laughing at my lady Whifler and Mr. Sneer.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady F._ Ay, my dear, were you? Oh, filthy Mr. Sneer! he is a\r\nnauseous figure, a most fulsamick fop. He spent two days together in\r\ngoing about Covent Garden to suit the lining of his coach with his\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n\"_Ld. F._ Oh, silly! yet his aunt is as fond of him, as if she had\r\nbrought the ape into the world herself.\r\n\r\n\"_Brisk._ Who? my Lady Toothless? Oh, she is a mortifying\r\nspectacle; she's always chewing the cud like an old ewe,\r\n\r\n\"_Ld. F._ Then she's always ready to laugh, when Sneer offers to\r\nspeak; and sits in expectation of his no jest, with her gums bare, and\r\nher mouth open--\r\n\r\n\"_Brisk._ Like an oyster at low ebb, egad--ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n\"_Cynthia._ _(Aside.)_ Well, I find there are no fools so\r\ninconsiderable themselves, but they can render other people contemptible\r\nby exposing their infirmities.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady F._ Then that t'other great strapping Lady--I can't hit off\r\nher name: the old fat fool, that paints so exorbitantly.\r\n\r\n\"_Brisk._ I know whom you mean--but, deuce take her, I can't hit\r\noff her name either--paints, d'ye say? Why she lays it on with a trowel.\r\nThen she has a great beard that bristles through it, and makes her look\r\nas if she was plastered with lime and hair, let me perish.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be a task not uninteresting, to enter into a detailed\r\ncomparison of the characteristics and merits of Mr. Sheridan, as a\r\ndramatic writer, with those of the other great masters of the art; and\r\nto consider how far they differed or agreed with each other, in the\r\nstructure of their plots and management of their dialogue--in the mode\r\nof laying the train of their repartee, or pointing the artillery of\r\ntheir wit. But I have already devoted to this part of my subject a much\r\nampler space, than to some of my readers will appear either necessary or\r\nagreeable;--though by others, more interested in such topics, my\r\ndiffuseness will, I trust, be readily pardoned. In tracking Mr. Sheridan\r\nthrough his too distinct careers of literature and of politics, it is on\r\nthe highest point of his elevation in each that the eye naturally rests;\r\nand the School for Scandal in one, and the Begum speeches in the other,\r\nare the two grand heights--the \"_summa biverticis umbra Parnassi_\"\r\n--from which he will stand out to after times, and round which,\r\ntherefore, his biographer may be excused for lingering with most\r\nfondness and delay.\r\n\r\nIt appears singular that, during the life of Mr. Sheridan, no authorized\r\nor correct edition of this play should have been published in England.\r\nHe had, at one time, disposed of the copy right to Mr. Ridgway of\r\nPiccadilly, but, after repeated applications from the latter for the\r\nmanuscript, he was told by Mr. Sheridan, as an excuse for keeping it\r\nback, that he had been nineteen years endeavoring to satisfy himself\r\nwith the style of the School for Scandal, but had not yet succeeded. Mr.\r\nRidgway, upon this, ceased to give him any further trouble on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe edition printed in Dublin is, with the exception of a few\r\nunimportant omissions and verbal differences, perfectly correct. It\r\nappears that, after the success of the comedy in London, he presented a\r\ncopy of it to his eldest sister, Mrs. Lefanu, to be disposed of, for her\r\nown advantage, to the manager of the Dublin Theatre. The sum of a\r\nhundred guineas, and free admissions for her family, were the terms upon\r\nwhich Ryder, the manager at that period, purchased from this lady the\r\nright of acting the play; and it was from the copy thus procured that\r\nthe edition afterwards published in Dublin was printed. I have collated\r\nthis edition with the copy given by Mr. Sheridan to Lady Crewe (the\r\nlast, I believe, ever revised by himself), [Footnote: Among the\r\ncorrections in this copy (which are in his own hand-writing, and but few\r\nin number), there is one which shows not only the retentiveness of his\r\nmemory, but the minute attention which he paid to the structure of his\r\nsentences. Lady Teazle, in her scene with Sir Peter in the Second Act,\r\nsays: \"That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter: and, after having married\r\nyou, I should never pretend to taste again, I allow.\" It was thus that\r\nthe passage stood at first in Lady Crewe's copy,--as it does still, too,\r\nin the Dublin edition, and in that given in the Collection of his\r\nWorks,--but in his final revision of this copy, the original reading of\r\nthe sentence, such as I find it in all his earlier manuscripts of the\r\nplay, is restored.--\"That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter; and, after\r\nhaving married you, I am sure I should never pretend to taste again.\"]\r\nand find it, with the few exceptions already mentioned, correct\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe School for Scandal has been translated into most of the languages of\r\nEurope, and, among the French particularly, has undergone a variety of\r\nmetamorphoses. A translation, undertaken, it appears, with the\r\npermission of Sheridan himself, was published in London, in the year\r\n1789, by a Monsieur Bunell Delille, who, in a dedication to \"Milord\r\nMacdonald,\" gives the following account of the origin of his task: \"Vous\r\nsavez, Milord, de quelle maniere mysterieuse cette piece, qui n'a jamais\r\nete imprime que furtivement, se trouva l'ete dernier sur ma table, en\r\nmanuscrit, in-folio; et, si vous daignez vous le rappeler, apres vous\r\navoir fait part de l'aventure, je courus chez Monsieur Sheridan pour lui\r\ndemander la permission,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe scenes of the Auction and the Screen were introduced, for the first\r\ntime, I believe, on the French stage, in a little piece called, \"_Les\r\nDeux Neveux_,\" acted in the year 1788, by the young comedians of the\r\nComte de Beaujolais. Since then, the story has been reproduced under\r\nvarious shapes and names:--\"Les Portraits de Famille,\" \"Valsain et\r\nFlorville,\" and, at the Theatre Francais, under the title of the\r\n\"Tartuffe de Moeurs.\" Lately, too, the taste for the subject has\r\nrevived. The Vaudeville has founded upon it a successful piece, called\r\n\"Les Deux Cousins;\" and there is even a melodrame at the Porte St.\r\nMartin, entitled \"L'Ecole du Scandale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFURTHER PURCHASE OF THEATRICAL PROPERTY.--MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF\r\nGARRICK.--ESSAY ON METRE.-THE CRITIC.--ESSAY ON ABSENTEES.--POLITICAL\r\nCONNECTIONS.--THE \"ENGLISHMAN.\"--ELECTED FOR STAFFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe document in Mr. Sheridan's handwriting, already mentioned, from\r\nwhich I have stated the sums paid in 1776 by him, Dr. Ford, and Mr.\r\nLinley, for Garrick's moiety of the Drury Lane Theatre, thus mentions\r\nthe new purchase, by which he extended his interest in this property in\r\nthe year 1778:--\"Mr. Sheridan afterwards was obliged to buy Mr. Lacy's\r\nmoiety at a price exceeding 45,000_l_.: this was in the year 1778.\"\r\nHe then adds--what it may be as well to cite, while I have the paper\r\nbefore me, though relating to subsequent changes in the property:--\"In\r\norder to enable Mr. S. to complete this purpose, he afterwards consented\r\nto divide his original share between Dr. Ford and Mr. Linley, so as to\r\nmake up each of theirs a quarter. But the price at which they purchased\r\nfrom Mr. Sheridan was not at the rate which he bought from Lacy, though\r\nat an advance on the price paid to Garrick. Mr. S. has since purchased\r\nDr. Ford's quarter for the sum of 17,000_l_., subject to the\r\nincreased incumbrance of the additional renters.\"\r\n\r\nBy what spell all these thousands were conjured up, it would be\r\ndifficult accurately to ascertain. That happy art--in which the people\r\nof this country are such adepts--of putting the future in pawn for the\r\nsupply of the present, must have been the chief resource of Mr. Sheridan\r\nin all these later purchases.\r\n\r\nAmong the visible signs of his increased influence in the affairs of the\r\ntheatre, was the appointment, this year, of his father to be manager;--a\r\nreconciliation having taken place between them, which was facilitated,\r\nno doubt, by the brightening prospects of the son, and by the generous\r\nconfidence which his prosperity gave him in making the first advances\r\ntowards such a reunion.\r\n\r\nOne of the novelties of the year was a musical entertainment called The\r\nCamp, which was falsely attributed to Mr. Sheridan at the time, and has\r\nsince been inconsiderately admitted into the Collection of his Works.\r\nThis unworthy trifle (as appears from a rough copy of it in my\r\npossession) was the production of Tickell, and the patience with which\r\nhis friend submitted to the imputation of having written it was a sort\r\nof \"martyrdom of fame\" which few but himself could afford.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1779 Garrick died, and Sheridan, as chief\r\nmourner, followed him to the grave. He also wrote a Monody to his\r\nmemory, which was delivered by Mrs. Yates, after the play of the West\r\nIndian, in the month of March following. During the interment of Garrick\r\nin Poet's Corner, Mr. Burke had remarked that the statue of Shakspeare\r\nseemed to point to the grave where the great actor of his works was\r\nlaid. This hint did not fall idly on the ear of Sheridan, as the\r\nfollowing _fixation_ of the thought, in the verses which he\r\nafterwards wrote, proved:--\r\n\r\n  \"The throng that mourn'd, as their dead favorite pass'd,\r\n  The grac'd respect that claim'd him to the last;\r\n  While Shakspeare's image, from its hallow'd base,\r\n  Seem'd to prescribe the grave and point the place.\"\r\n\r\nThis Monody, which was the longest flight ever sustained by its author\r\nin verse, is more remarkable, perhaps, for refinement and elegance, than\r\nfor either novelty of thought or depth of sentiment. There is, however,\r\na fine burst of poetical eloquence in the lines beginning \"Superior\r\nhopes the poet's bosom fire;\" and this passage, accordingly, as being\r\nthe best in the poem, was, by the gossiping critics of the day,\r\nattributed to Tickell,--from the same laudable motives that had induced\r\nthem to attribute Tickell's bad farce to Sheridan. There is no end to\r\nthe variety of these small missiles of malice, with which the Gullivers\r\nof the world of literature are assailed by the Lilliputians around them.\r\n\r\nThe chief thought which pervades this poem,--namely, the fleeting nature\r\nof the actor's art and fame,--had already been more simply expressed by\r\nGarrick himself in his Prologue to The Clandestine Marriage:--\r\n\r\n  \"The painter's dead, yet still he charms the eye;\r\n  While England lives, his fame can never die;\r\n  But he who struts his hour upon the stage,\r\n  Can scarce protract his fame through half an age;\r\n  Nor pen nor pencil can the actor save;\r\n  The art and artist have one common grave.\"\r\n\r\nColley Cibber, too, in his portrait (if I remember right) of Betterton,\r\nbreaks off into the same reflection, in the following graceful passage,\r\nwhich is one of those instances, where prose could not be exchanged for\r\npoetry without loss:--\"Pity it is that the momentary beauties, flowing\r\nfrom an harmonious elocution, cannot, like those of poetry, be their own\r\nrecord; that the animated graces of the player can live no longer than\r\nthe instant breath and motion that presents them, or, at best, can but\r\nfaintly glimmer through the memory of a few surviving spectators.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the style and versification of the Monody, the heroic\r\ncouplet in which it is written has long been a sort of Ulysses' bow, at\r\nwhich Poetry tries her suitors, and at which they almost all fail.\r\nRedundancy of epithet and monotony of cadence are the inseparable\r\ncompanions of this metre in ordinary hands; nor could all the taste and\r\nskill of Sheridan keep it wholly free from these defects in his own. To\r\nthe subject of metre, he had, nevertheless, paid great attention. There\r\nare among his papers some fragments of an Essay [Footnote: Or rather\r\nmemorandums collected, as was his custom, with a view to the composition\r\nof such an Essay. He had been reading the writings of Dr. Foster, Webb,\r\n&c. on this subject, with the intention, apparently, of publishing an\r\nanswer to them. The following (which is one of the few consecutive\r\npassages I can find in these notes) will show how little reverence he\r\nentertained for that ancient prosody, upon which, in the system of\r\nEnglish education, so large and precious a portion of human life is\r\nwasted:--\"I never desire a stronger proof that an author is on a wrong\r\nscent on these subjects, than to see Quintilian, Aristotle, &c., quoted\r\non a point where they have not the least business. All poetry is made by\r\nthe ear, which must be the sole judge--it is a sort of musical rhythmus.\r\nIf then we want to reduce our practical harmony to rules, every man,\r\nwith a knowledge of his own language and a good ear, is at once\r\ncompetent to the undertaking. Let him trace it to music--if he has no\r\nknowledge, let him inquire.\r\n\r\n\"We have lost all notion of the ancient accent;--we have lost their\r\npronunciation;--all puzzling about it is ridiculous, and trying to find\r\nout the melody of our own verse by theirs is still worse. We should have\r\nhad all our own metres, if we never had heard a word of their language,\r\n--this I affirm. Every nation finds out for itself a national melody; and\r\nwe may say of it, as of religion, no place has been discovered without\r\nmusic. A people, likewise, as their language improves, will introduce a\r\nmusic into their poetry, which is simply (that is to say, the numerical\r\npart of poetry, which must be distinguished from the imaginary) the\r\ntransferring the time of melody into speaking. What then have the Greeks\r\nor Romans to do with our music? It is plain that our admiration of their\r\nverse is mere pedantry, because we could not adopt it. Sir Philip Sidney\r\nfailed. If it had been melody, we should have had it; our language is\r\njust as well calculated for it.\r\n\r\n\"It is astonishing that the excessive ridiculousness of a Gradus or\r\nProsodial Dictionary has never struck our scholars. The idea of looking\r\ninto a book to see whether the _sound_ of a syllable be short or\r\nlong is absolutely as much a bull of Boeotian pedantry as ever disgraced\r\nIreland.\" He then adds, with reference to some mistakes which Dr. Foster\r\nhad appeared to him to have committed in his accentuation of English\r\nwords:--\"What strange effects has this system brought about! It has so\r\ncorrupted the ear, that absolutely our scholars cannot tell an English\r\nlong syllable from a short one. If a boy were to make the _a_ in\r\n'cano' or 'amo' long, Dr. F. would no doubt feel his ear hurt, and\r\nyet....\"\r\n\r\nOf the style in which some of his observations are committed to paper,\r\nthe following is a curious specimen:--\"Dr. Foster says that short\r\nsyllables, when inflated with that emphasis which the sense demands,\r\nswell in height, length, and breadth beyond their natural size.--The\r\ndevil they do! Here is a most omnipotent power in emphasis. Quantity and\r\naccent may in vain toil to produce a little effect, but emphasis comes\r\nat once and monopolizes the power of them both.\"]\r\n\r\nwhich he had commenced on the nature of poetical accent and emphasis;\r\nand the adaptation of his verses to the airs in the Duenna--even\r\nallowing for the aid which he received from Mrs. Sheridan--shows a\r\ndegree of musical feeling, from which a much greater variety of cadence\r\nmight be expected, than we find throughout the versification of this\r\npoem. The taste of the time, however, was not prepared for any great\r\nvariations in the music of the couplet. The regular foot-fall,\r\nestablished so long, had yet been but little disturbed; and the only\r\nlicense of this kind hazarded through the poem--\"All perishable\"--was\r\nobjected to by some of the author's critical friends, who suggested,\r\nthat it would be better thus: \"All doom'd to perish.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever in more important points may be the inferiority of the present\r\nschool of poetry to that which preceded it, in the music of\r\nversification there can be but little doubt of its improvement; nor has\r\ncriticism, perhaps, ever rendered a greater service to the art, than in\r\nhelping to unseal the ears of its worshippers to that true spheric\r\nharmony of the elders of song, which, during a long period of our\r\nliterature, was as unheard as if it never existed.\r\n\r\nThe Monody does not seem to have kept the stage more than five or six\r\nnights;--nor is this surprising. The recitation of a long, serious\r\naddress must always be, to a certain degree, ineffective on the stage;\r\nand, though this subject contained within it many strong sources of\r\ninterest, as well personal as dramatic, they were not, perhaps, turned\r\nto account by the poet with sufficient warmth and earnestness on his own\r\npart, to excite a very ready response of sympathy in others. Feeling\r\nnever wanders into generalities--it is only by concentrating his rays\r\nupon one point that even Genius can kindle strong emotion; and, in order\r\nto produce any such effect in the present instance upon the audience,\r\nGarrick himself ought to have been kept prominently and individually\r\nbefore their eyes in almost every line. Instead of this, however, the\r\nman is soon forgotten in his Art, which is then deliberately compared\r\nwith other Arts, and the attention, through the greater part of the\r\npoem, is diffused over the transitoriness of actors in general, instead\r\nof being brought strongly to a focus upon the particular loss just\r\nsustained. Even in those parts which apply most directly to Garrick, the\r\nfeeling is a good deal diluted by this tendency to the abstract; and,\r\nsometimes, by a false taste of personification, like that in the very\r\nfirst line,--\r\n\r\n  \"If dying _excellence_ deserves a tear,\"\r\n\r\nwhere the substitution of a quality of the man for the man himself\r\n[Footnote: Another instance of this fault occurs in his song \"When sable\r\nNight:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"As some fond mother, o'er her babe deploring,\r\n  Wakes _its beauty_ with a tear;\"\r\n\r\nwhere the clearness and reality of the picture are spoiled by the\r\naffectation of representing the _beauty_ of the child as waked,\r\ninstead of the child itself.] puts the mind, as it were, one remove\r\nfarther from the substantial object of its interest, and disturbs that\r\nsense of reality, on which the operations even of Fancy itself ought to\r\nbe founded.\r\n\r\nBut it is very easy to play the critic--so easy as to be a task of but\r\nlittle glory. For one person who could produce such a poem as this, how\r\nmany thousands exist and have existed, who could shine in the exposition\r\nof its faults! Though insufficient, perhaps, in itself, to create a\r\nreputation for an author, yet, as a \"_stella Coronae_\"--one of the\r\nstars in that various crown, which marks the place of Sheridan in the\r\nfirmament of Fame,--it not only well sustains its own part in the\r\nlustre, but draws new light from the host of brilliancy around it.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of this same year that he produced the\r\nentertainment of the Critic--his last legitimate offering on the shrine\r\nof the Dramatic Muse. In this admirable farce we have a striking\r\ninstance of that privilege which, as I have already said, Genius\r\nassumes, of taking up subjects that had passed through other hands, and\r\ngiving them a new value and currency by his stamp. The plan of a\r\nRehearsal was first adopted for the purpose of ridiculing Dryden, by the\r\nDuke of Buckingham; but, though there is much laughable humor in some of\r\nthe dialogue between Bayes and his friends, the salt of the satire\r\naltogether was not of a very conservative nature, and the piece\r\ncontinued to be served up to the public long after it had lost its\r\nrelish. Fielding tried the same plan in a variety of pieces--in his\r\nPasquin, his Historical Register, his Author's Farce, his Eurydice,\r\n&c.,--but without much success, except in the comedy of Pasquin, which\r\nhad, I believe, at first a prosperous career, though it has since,\r\nexcept with the few that still read it for its fine tone of pleasantry,\r\nfallen into oblivion. It was reserved for Sheridan to give vitality to\r\nthis form of dramatic humor, and to invest even his satirical portraits\r\n--as in the instance of Sir Fretful Plagiary, which, it is well known,\r\nwas designed for Cumberland--with a generic character, which, without\r\nweakening the particular resemblance, makes them representatives for\r\never of the whole class to which the original belonged. Bayes, on the\r\ncontrary, is a caricature--made up of little more than personal\r\npeculiarities, which may amuse as long as reference can be had to the\r\nprototype, but, like those supplemental features furnished from the\r\nliving subject by Taliacotius, fall lifeless the moment the individual\r\nthat supplied them is defunct.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that Bayes was not forgotten in the composition\r\nof The Critic. His speech, where the two Kings of Brentford are singing\r\nin the clouds, may be considered as the exemplar which Sheridan had\r\nbefore him in writing some of the rehearsal scenes of Puff:--\r\n\r\n\"_Smith._ Well, but methinks the sense of this song is not very\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\"_Bayes._ Plain! why did you ever hear any people in the clouds\r\nsing plain? They must be all for flight of fancy at its fullest range,\r\nwithout the least check or control upon it. When once you tie up spirits\r\nand people in clouds to speak plain, you spoil all.\"\r\n\r\nThere are particular instances of imitation still more direct. Thus in\r\nThe Critic:\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ SIR WALTER RALEIGH _and_ SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir Christ. H._ True, gallant Raleigh.--\r\n\r\n\"_Dangle._ What, had they been talking before?\r\n\r\n\"_Puff._ Oh yes, all the way as they came along.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same manner in The Rehearsal, where the Physician and Usher of\r\nthe two Kings enter:--\r\n\r\n\"_Phys._ Sir, to conclude--\r\n\r\n\"_Smith._ What, before he begins?\r\n\r\n\"_Bayes._ No, Sir, you must know they had been talking of this a\r\npretty while without.\r\n\r\n\"_Smith._ Where? in the tyring room?\r\n\r\n\"_Bayes._ Why, ay, Sir. He's so dull.\"\r\n\r\nBayes, at the opening of the Fifth Act, says, \"Now, gentlemen, I will be\r\nbold to say, I'll show you the greatest scene that England ever saw; I\r\nmean not for words, for those I don't value, but for state, show, and\r\nmagnificence.\" Puff announces his grand scene in much the same manner:--\r\n\"Now then for my magnificence! my battle! my noise! and my procession!\"\r\n\r\nIn Fielding, too, we find numerous hints or germs, that have come to\r\ntheir full growth of wit in The Critic. For instance, in Trapwit (a\r\ncharacter in \"Pasquin\") there are the rudiments of Sir Fretful as well\r\nas of Puff:--\r\n\r\n\"_Sneerwell._ Yes, faith, I think I would cut that last speech.\r\n\r\n\"_Trapwit._ Sir, I'll sooner cut off an ear or two; Sir, that's the\r\nvery best thing in the whole play....\r\n\r\n\"_Trapwit._ Now, Mr. Sneerwell, we shall begin my third and last\r\nact; and I believe I may defy all the poets who have ever writ, or ever\r\nwill write, to produce its equal: it is, Sir, so crammed with drums and\r\ntrumpets, thunder and lightning, battles and ghosts, that I believe the\r\naudience will want no entertainment after it.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager, Marplay, in \"The Author's Farce,\" like him of Drury Lane in\r\nthe Critic, \"does the town the honor of writing himself;\" and the\r\nfollowing incident in \"The Historical Register\" suggested possibly the\r\nhumorous scene of Lord Burleigh:--\r\n\r\n\"Enter Four Patriots from different Doors, who meet in the centre and\r\nshake Hands.\r\n\r\n\"_Sour-wit._ These patriots seem to equal your greatest politicians\r\nin their silence.\r\n\r\n\"_Medley._ Sir, what they think now cannot well be spoke, but you\r\nmay conjecture a good deal from their shaking their heads.\"\r\n\r\nSuch coincidences, whether accidental or designed, are at least curious,\r\nand the following is another of somewhat a different kind:--\"Steal!\r\n(says Sir Fretful) to be sure they may; and egad, serve your best\r\nthoughts as gipsies do stolen children, disfigure them, to make 'em pass\r\nfor their own.\" [Footnote: This simile was again made use of by him in a\r\nspeech upon Mr. Pitt's India Bill, which he declared to be \"nothing more\r\nthan a bad plagiarism on Mr. Fox's, disfigured, indeed, as gipsies do\r\nstolen children, in order to make them pass for their own.\"] Churchill\r\nhas the same idea in nearly the same language:--\r\n\r\n  \"Still pilfers wretched plans and makes them worse,\r\n  Like gipsies, lest the stolen brat be known,\r\n  Defacing first, then claiming for their own.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of Puff, as I have already shown, was our author's first\r\ndramatic attempt; and, having left it unfinished in the porch as he\r\nentered the temple of Comedy, he now, we see, made it worthy of being\r\nhis farewell oblation in quitting it. Like Eve's flowers, it was his\r\n\r\n  \"Early visitation, and his last.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, forget a lively Epilogue which he wrote this year,\r\nfor Miss Hannah More's tragedy of Fatal Falsehood, in which there is a\r\ndescription of a blue-stocking lady, executed with all his happiest\r\npoint. Of this dense, epigrammatic style, in which every line is a\r\ncartridge of wit in itself, Sheridan was, both in prose and verse, a\r\nconsummate master; and if any one could hope to succeed, after Pope, in\r\na Mock Epic, founded upon fashionable life, it would have been, we\r\nshould think, the writer of this epilogue. There are some verses,\r\nwritten on the \"_Immortelle Emilie_\" of Voltaire, in which her\r\nemployments, as a _savante_ and a woman of the world, are thus\r\ncontrasted:--\r\n\r\n  _\"Tout lui plait, tout convient a son vaste genie,\r\n  Les livres, les bijoux, les compas, les pompons,\r\n  Les vers, les diamans, les beribis, l'optique,\r\n  L'algebre, les soupers, le Latin, les jupons,\r\n  L'opera, les proces, le bal, et la physique.\"_\r\n\r\nHow powerfully has Sheridan, in bringing out the same contrasts, shown\r\nthe difference between the raw material of a thought, and the fine\r\nfabric as it comes from the hands of a workman:--\r\n\r\n  \"What motley cares Corilla's mind perplex,\r\n  Whom maids and metaphors conspire to vex!\r\n  In studious deshabille behold her sit,\r\n  A letter'd gossip and a housewife wit:\r\n  At once invoking, though for different views,\r\n  Her gods, her cook, her milliner, and muse.\r\n  Round her strew'd room a frippery chaos lies,\r\n  A chequer'd wreck of notable and wise.\r\n  Bills, books, caps, couplets, combs, a varied mass,\r\n  Oppress the toilet and obscure the glass;\r\n  Unfinished here an epigram is laid,\r\n  And there a mantua-maker's bill unpaid.\r\n  There new-born plays foretaste the town's applause,\r\n  There dormant patterns pine for future gauze.\r\n  A moral essay now is all her care,\r\n  A satire next, and then a bill of fare.\r\n  A scene she now projects, and now a dish,\r\n  Here Act the First, and here 'Remove with Fish.'\r\n  Now, while this eye in a fine frenzy rolls,\r\n  That soberly casts up a bill for coals;\r\n  Black pins and daggers in one leaf she sticks.\r\n  And tears, and threads, and bowls, and thimbles mix.\"\r\n\r\nWe must now prepare to follow the subject of this Memoir into a field of\r\ndisplay, altogether different, where he was in turn to become an actor\r\nbefore the public himself, and where, instead of inditing lively\r\nspeeches for others, he was to deliver the dictates of his eloquence and\r\nwit from his own lips. However the lovers of the drama may lament this\r\ndiversion of his talents, and doubt whether even the chance of another\r\nSchool for Scandal were not worth more than all his subsequent career,\r\nyet to the individual himself, full of ambition, and conscious of\r\nversatility of powers, such an opening into a new course of action and\r\nfame, must have been like one of those sudden turnings of the road in a\r\nbeautiful country, which dazzle the eyes of a traveller with new\r\nglories, and invite him on to untried paths of fertility and sunshine.\r\n\r\nIt has been before remarked how early, in a majority of instances, the\r\ndramatic talent has come to its fullest maturity. Mr. Sheridan would\r\npossibly never have exceeded what he had already done, and his celebrity\r\nhad now reached that point of elevation, where, by a sort of optical\r\ndeception in the atmosphere of fame, to remain stationary is to seem, in\r\nthe eyes of the spectators, to fall. He had, indeed, enjoyed only the\r\ntriumphs of talent, and without even descending to those ovations, or\r\nminor triumphs, which in general are little more than celebrations of\r\nescape from defeat, and to which they, who surpass all but themselves,\r\nare often capriciously reduced. It is questionable, too, whether, in any\r\nother walk of literature, he would have sustained the high reputation\r\nwhich he acquired by the drama. Very rarely have dramatic writers, even\r\nof the first rank, exhibited powers of equal rate, when out of the\r\nprecincts of their own art; while, on the other hand, poets of a more\r\ngeneral range, whether epic, lyric, or satiric, have as rarely succeeded\r\non the stage. There is, indeed, hardly one of our celebrated dramatic\r\nauthors (and the remark might be extended to other countries) who has\r\nleft works worthy of his reputation in any other line; and Mr. Sheridan,\r\nperhaps, might only have been saved from adding to the list of failures,\r\nby such a degree of prudence or of indolence as would have prevented him\r\nfrom making the attempt. He may, therefore, be said to have closed his\r\naccount with literature, when not only the glory of his past successes,\r\nbut the hopes of all that he might yet have achieved, were set down\r\nfully, and without any risk of forfeiture, to his credit; and, instead\r\nof being left, like Alexander, to sigh for new worlds to vanquish, no\r\nsooner were his triumphs in one sphere of action complete than another\r\nopened to invite him to new conquests.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Politics, from the very commencement of his\r\ncareer, had held divided empire with Literature in the tastes and\r\nstudies of Mr. Sheridan; and, even in his fullest enjoyment of the\r\nsmiles of the Comic Muse, while he stood without a rival in _her_\r\naffections, the \"_Musa severior_\" of politics was estranging the\r\nconstancy of his--\r\n\r\n  \"_Te tenet, absentes alios suspirat amores_\"\r\n\r\n  \"_E'en while perfection lies within his arms,\r\n  He strays in thought, and sighs for other charms._\"\r\n\r\nAmong his manuscripts there are some sheets of an Essay on Absentees,\r\nwhich, from the allusions it contains to the measures then in\r\ncontemplation for Ireland, must have been written, I rather think, about\r\nthe year 1778--when the School for Scandal was in its first career of\r\nsuccess, and the Critic preparing, at no very long interval, to partake\r\nits triumph. It is obvious, from some expressions used in this pamphlet,\r\nthat his intention was, if not to publish it in Ireland, at least to\r\ngive it the appearance of having been written there--and, except the\r\npure unmixed motive of rendering a service to his country, by the\r\ndiscussion of a subject so closely connected with her interests, it is\r\ndifficult to conceive what inducement he could have had to select at\r\nthat moment such a topic for his pen. The plain, unpretending style of\r\nthe greater part of the composition sufficiently proves that literary\r\ndisplay was not the object of it; while the absence of all criminatory\r\nmatter against the government precludes the idea of its having\r\noriginated in party zeal.\r\n\r\nAs it is curious to observe how soberly his genius could yoke itself to\r\ngrave matter of fact, after the winged excursions in which it had been\r\nindulging, I shall here lay some paragraphs of this pamphlet before the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIn describing the effects of the prevailing system of pasturage--one of\r\nthe evils attributed by him to Absentees,--he thus, with occasional\r\nirradiations of eloquence and ingenuity, expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n\"Now it must ever be the interest of the Absentee to place his estates\r\nin the hands of as few tenants as possible, by which means there will be\r\nless difficulty or hazard in collecting his rents, and less intrusted to\r\nan agent, if his estate require one. The easiest method of effecting\r\nthis is by laying the land out for pasturage, and letting it in gross to\r\nthose who deal only in 'a fatal living crop'--whose produce we are not\r\nallowed a market for when manufactured, while we want art, honesty, and\r\nencouragement to fit it for home consumption. Thus the indolent\r\nextravagance of the lord becomes subservient to the interest of a few\r\nmercenary graziers--shepherds of most unpastoral principles--while the\r\nveteran husbandman may lean on the shattered, unused plough, and view\r\nhimself surrounded with flocks that furnish raiment without food. Or, if\r\nhis honesty be not proof against the hard assaults of penury, he may be\r\nled to revenge himself on these dumb innovators of his little field--\r\nthen learn too late that some portion of the soil is reserved for a crop\r\nmore fatal even than that which tempted and destroyed him.\r\n\r\n\"Without dwelling on the particular ill effects of non-residence in this\r\ncase, I shall conclude with representing that principal and supreme\r\nprerogative which the Absentee foregoes--the prerogative of mercy, of\r\ncharity. The estated resident is invested with a kind of relieving\r\nprovidence--a power to heal the wounds of undeserved misfortune--to\r\nbreak the blows of adverse fortune, and leave chance no power to undo\r\nthe hopes of honest persevering industry. There cannot surely be a more\r\nhappy station than that wherein prosperity and worldly interest are to\r\nbe best forwarded by an exertion of the most endearing offices of\r\nhumanity. This is his situation who lives on the soil which furnishes\r\nhim with means to live. It is his interest to watch the devastation of\r\nthe storm, the ravage of the flood--to mark the pernicious extremes of\r\nthe elements, and, by a judicious indulgence and assistance, to convert\r\nthe sorrows and repinings of the sufferer into blessings on his\r\nhumanity. By such a conduct he saves his people from the sin of\r\nunrighteous murmurs, and makes Heaven his debtor for their resignation.\r\n\r\n\"It will be said that the residing in another kingdom will never erase\r\nfrom humane minds the duty and attention which they owe to those whom\r\nthey have left to cultivate their demesnes. I will not say that absence\r\nlessens their humanity, or that the superior dissipation which they\r\nenjoy in it contracts their feelings to coarser enjoyments--without\r\nthis, we know that agents and stewards are seldom intrusted with full\r\npowers of aiding and remitting. In some, compassion would be injustice.\r\nThey are, in general, content with the virtue of justice and punctuality\r\ntowards their employer; part of which they conceive to be a rigorous\r\nexaction of his rents, and, where difficulty occurs, their process is\r\nsimply to distrain and to eject--a rigor that must ever be prejudicial\r\nto an estate, and which, practised frequently, betrays either an\r\noriginal negligence, or want of judgment in choosing tenants, or an\r\nextreme inhumanity towards their incidental miscarriages.\r\n\r\n\"But, granting an undiminished benevolence to exist on the part both of\r\nthe landlord and the agent, yet can we expect any great exertion of\r\npathetic eloquence to proceed from the latter to palliate any deficiency\r\nof the tenants?--or, if there were, do we not know how much lighter an\r\nimpression is made by distresses related to us than by those which are\r\n'_oculis subjecta fidelibus?_ The heart, the seat of charity and\r\ncompassion, is more accessible to the senses than the understanding.\r\nMany, who would be unmoved by any address to the latter, would melt into\r\ncharity at the eloquent persuasion of silent sorrow. When he _sees_\r\nthe widow's tear, and hears the orphan's sigh, every one will act with a\r\nsudden uniform rectitude, because he acts from the divine impulse of\r\n'free love dealt equally to all.'\"\r\n\r\nThe blind selfishness of those commercial laws, which England so long\r\nimposed upon Ireland,--like ligatures to check the circulation of the\r\nempire's life-blood,--is thus adverted to:\r\n\r\n\"Though I have mentioned the decay of trade in Ireland as insufficient\r\nto occasion the great increase of emigration, yet is it to be considered\r\nas an important ill effect, arising from the same cause. It may be said\r\nthat trade is now in higher repute in Ireland, and that the exports and\r\nimports (which are always supposed the test of it) are daily increasing.\r\nThis may be admitted to be true, yet cannot it be said that the trade of\r\nthe kingdom flourishes. The trade of a kingdom should increase in exact\r\nproportion to its luxuries, and those of the nations connected with it.\r\nTherefore it is no argument to say, that, on examining the accounts of\r\ncustoms fifty years back, they appear to be trebled now; for England, by\r\nsome sudden stroke, might lose such a proportion of its trade, as would\r\nruin it as a commercial nation, yet the amount of what remained might be\r\ntenfold of what it enjoyed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Trade,\r\nproperly speaking, is the commutations of the product of each country--\r\nthis extends itself to the exchange of commodities in which art has\r\nfixed a price. Where a nation hath free power to export the works of its\r\nindustry, the balance in such articles will certainly be in its favor.\r\nThus had we in Ireland power to export our manufactured silks, stuffs,\r\nand woollens, we should be assured that it would be our interest to\r\nimport and cultivate their materials. But, as this is not the case, the\r\ngain of individuals is no proof that the nation is benefited by such\r\ncommerce. For instance, the exportation of un-wrought wool may be very\r\nadvantageous to the dealer, and, through his hands, bring money, or a\r\nbeneficial return of commodities into the kingdom; but trace the ill\r\neffects of depopulating such tracts of land as are necessary for the\r\nsupport of flocks to supply this branch, and number those who are\r\ndeprived of support and employment by it, and so become a dead weight on\r\nthe community--we shall find that the nation in fact will be the poorer\r\nfor this apparent advantage. This would be remedied were we allowed to\r\nexport it manufactured; because the husbandman might get his bread as a\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\n\"Another principal cause that the trade may increase, without\r\nproportionally benefiting the nation, is that a great part of the stock\r\nwhich carries on the foreign trade of Ireland belongs to those who\r\nreside out of the country--thus the ultimate and material profits on it\r\nare withdrawn to another kingdom. It is likewise to be observed, that,\r\nthough the exportations may appear to exceed the importations, yet may\r\nthis in part arise from the accounts of the former being of a more\r\ncertain nature, and those of the latter very conjectural, and always\r\nfalling short of the fact.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Sheridan afterwards opposed a Union with Ireland, the train\r\nof reasoning which he pursued in this pamphlet naturally led him to look\r\nforward to such an arrangement between the two countries, as, perhaps,\r\nthe only chance of solving the long-existing problem of their\r\nrelationship to each other.\r\n\r\n\"It is the state, (he continues,) the luxury, and fashions of the\r\nwealthy, that give life to the artificers of elegance and taste;--it is\r\ntheir numerous train that sends the rapid shuttle through the loom;--\r\nand, when they leave their country, they not only beggar these\r\ndependents, but the tribes that lived by clothing them.\r\n\r\n\"An extravagant passion for luxuries hath been in all nations a symptom\r\nof an approaching dissolution. However, in commercial states, while it\r\npredominates only among the higher ranks, it brings with it the\r\nconciliating advantage of being greatly beneficial to trade and\r\nmanufactures. But, how singularly unfortunate is that kingdom, where the\r\nluxurious passions of the great beggar those who should be supported by\r\nthem,--a kingdom, whose wealthy members keep equal pace with their\r\nnumbers in the dissipated and fantastical pursuits of life, without\r\nsuffering the lower class to glean even the dregs of their vices. While\r\nthis is the case with Ireland the prosperity of her trade must be all\r\nforced and unnatural; and if, in the absence of its wealthy and estated\r\nmembers, the state already feels all the disadvantages of a Union, it\r\ncannot do better than endeavor at a free trade by effecting it in\r\nreality.\"\r\n\r\nHaving demonstrated, at some length, the general evil of absenteeism, he\r\nthus proceeds to inquire into the most eligible remedy for it:--\r\n\r\n\"The evil complained of is simply the absence of the proprietors of a\r\ncertain portion of the landed property. This is an evil unprovided\r\nagainst by the legislature;--therefore, we are not to consider whether\r\nit might not with propriety have been guarded against, but whether a\r\nremedy or alleviation of it can now be attempted consistently with the\r\nspirit of the Constitution. On examining all the most obvious methods of\r\nattempting this, I believe there will appear but two practicable. The\r\nFirst will be by enacting a law for the frequent summoning the\r\nproprietors of landed property to appear _de facto_ at stated\r\ntimes. The Second will be the voting a supply to be raised from the\r\nestates of such as do never reside in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"The First, it is obvious, would be an obligation of no use, without a\r\npenalty was affixed to the breach of it, amounting to the actual\r\nforfeiture of the estate of the recusant. This, we are informed, was\r\nonce the case in Ireland. But at present, whatever advantage the kingdom\r\nmight reap by it, it could not possibly be reconciled to the genius of\r\nthe Constitution: and, if the fine were trifling, it would prove the\r\nsame as the second method, with the disadvantage of appearing to treat\r\nas an act of delinquency what in no way infringes the municipal laws of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"In the Second method the legislature is, in no respect, to be supposed\r\nto regard the _person_ of the Absentee. It prescribes no place of\r\nresidence to him, nor attempts to summon or detain him. The light it\r\ntakes up the point in is this--that the welfare of the whole is injured\r\nby the produce of a certain portion of the soil being sent out of the\r\nkingdom.... It will be said that the produce of the soil is not exported\r\nby being carried to our own markets; but if the value received in\r\nexchange for it, whatever it be, whether money or commodities, be\r\nexported, it is exactly the same in its ultimate effects as if the\r\ngrain, flocks, &c. were literally sent to England. In this light, then,\r\nif the state is found to suffer by such an exportation, its deducting a\r\nsmall part from the produce is simply a reimbursing the public, and\r\nputting the loss of the public (to whose welfare the interest of\r\nindividuals is always to be subservient) upon those very members who\r\noccasion that loss.\r\n\r\n\"This is only to be effected by a tax.\"\r\n\r\nThough to a political economist of the present day much of what is so\r\nloosely expressed in these extracts will appear but the crudities of a\r\ntyro in the science, yet, at the time when they were written,--when both\r\nMr. Fox and Mr. Burke could expatiate on the state of Ireland, without a\r\nsingle attempt to develop or enforce those simple, but wise principles\r\nof commercial policy, every one of which had been violated in the\r\nrestrictions on her industry,--it was no small merit in Mr. Sheridan to\r\nhave advanced even thus far in a branch of knowledge so rare and so\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his own early taste for politics, the intimacies which he\r\nhad now formed with some of the most eminent public men of the day must\r\nhave considerably tended to turn his ambition in that direction. At what\r\ntime he first became acquainted with Mr. Fox I have no means of\r\nascertaining exactly. Among the letters addressed to him by that\r\nstatesman, there is one which, from the formality of its style, must\r\nhave been written at the very commencement of their acquaintance--but,\r\nunluckily, it is not dated. Lord John Townshend, who first had the\r\nhappiness of bringing two such men together, has given the following\r\ninteresting account of their meeting, and of the impressions which they\r\nleft upon the minds of each other. His lordship, however, has not\r\nspecified the period of this introduction:--\r\n\r\n\"I made the first dinner-party at which they met, having told Fox that\r\nall the notions he might have conceived of Sheridan's talents and genius\r\nfrom the comedy of The Rivals, &c. would fall infinitely short of the\r\nadmiration of his astonishing powers, which I was sure he would\r\nentertain at the first interview. The first interview between them\r\n(there were very few present, only Tickell and myself, and one or two\r\nmore) I shall never forget. Fox told me, after breaking up from dinner,\r\nthat he had always thought Hare, after my uncle, Charles Townshend, the\r\nwittiest man he ever met with, but that Sheridan surpassed them both\r\ninfinitely; and Sheridan told me next day that he was quite lost in\r\nadmiration of Fox, and that it was a puzzle to him to say what he\r\nadmired most, his commanding superiority of talent and universal\r\nknowledge, or his playful fancy, artless manners, and benevolence of\r\nheart, which showed itself in every word he uttered.\"\r\n\r\nWith Burke Mr. Sheridan became acquainted at the celebrated Turk's Head\r\nClub,--and, if any incentive was wanting to his new passion for\r\npolitical distinction, the station to which he saw his eloquent fellow-\r\ncountryman exalted, with no greater claims from birth or connection than\r\nhis own, could not have failed to furnish it. His intimacy with Mr.\r\nWindham began, as we have seen, very early at Bath, and the following\r\nletter, addressed to him by that gentleman from Norfolk, in the year\r\n1778, is a curious record not only of the first political movements of a\r\nperson so celebrated as Mr. Windham, but of the interest with which\r\nSheridan then entered into the public measures of the day:--\r\n\r\n\"Jan. 5, 1778.\r\n\r\n\"I fear my letter will greatly disappoint your hopes. [Footnote: Mr.\r\nWindham had gone down to Norfolk, in consequence of a proposed meeting\r\nin that county, under the auspices of Lord Townshend, for the purpose of\r\nraising a subscription in aid of government, to be applied towards\r\ncarrying on the war with the American colonies. In about three weeks\r\nafter the date of this letter, the meeting was held, and Mr. Windham, in\r\na spirited answer to Lord Townshend, made the first essay of his\r\neloquence in public.] I have no account to send you of my answering Lord\r\nTownshend--of hard-fought contests--spirited resolves--ballads, mobs,\r\ncockades, and Lord North burnt in effigy. We have had a bloodless\r\ncampaign, but not from backwardness in our troops, but for the most\r\ncreditable reason that can be--want of resolution in the enemy to\r\nencounter us. When I got down here early this morning, expecting to find\r\na room prepared, a chair set for the president, and nothing wanting but\r\nthat the orators should begin, I was surprised to learn that no\r\nadvertisement had appeared on the other part; but that Lord T. having\r\ndined at a meeting, where the proposal was received very coldly, had\r\ntaken fright, and for the time at least had dropped the proposal. It had\r\nappeared, therefore, to those whom I applied to (and I think very\r\nrightly) that till an advertisement was inserted by them, or was known\r\nfor certain to be intended, it would not be proper for any thing to be\r\ndone by us. In this state, therefore, it rests. The advertisement which\r\nwe agreed upon is left at the printer's, ready to be inserted upon the\r\nappearance of one from them. We lie upon our arms, and shall begin to\r\nact upon any motion of the enemy. I am very sorry that things have taken\r\nthis turn, as I came down in full confidence of being able to accomplish\r\nsomething distinguished. I had drawn up, as I came along, a tolerably\r\ngood paper, to be distributed to-morrow in the streets, and settled\r\npretty well in my head the terms of a protest--besides some pretty\r\nsmart pieces of oratory, delivered upon Newmarket Heath. I never felt so\r\nmuch disposition to exert myself before--I hope from my never having\r\nbefore so fair a prospect of doing it with success. When the coach comes\r\nin, I hope I shall receive a packet from you, which shall not be lost,\r\nthough it may not be used immediately.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave off writing, for I have got some other letters to send by\r\nto-night's post. Writing in this ink is like speaking with respect to\r\nthe utter annihilation of what is past;--by the time it gets to you,\r\nperhaps, it may have become legible, but I have no chance of reading\r\nover my letter myself.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not suffer this occasion to pass over entirely without benefit.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me yours most truly,\r\n\r\n\"W. WlNDHAM.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Mrs. Sheridan that I hope she will have a closet ready, where I\r\nmay remain till the heat of the pursuit is over. My friends in France\r\nhave promised to have a vessel ready upon the coast.\r\n\r\n\"Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Esq.,\r\n\r\n\"Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe first political service rendered by Mr. Sheridan to the party with\r\nwhom he now closely connected himself, was the active share which he\r\ntook in a periodical paper called The Englishman, set up by the Whigs\r\nfor the purpose of seconding, out of parliament, the crimination and\r\ninvective of which they kept up such a brisk fire within. The intention,\r\nas announced by Sheridan in the first Number, [Footnote: Published 13th\r\nof March, 1779.] was, like Swift in the Drapier's Letters, to\r\naccommodate the style of the publication to the comprehension of persons\r\nin \"that class of the community, who are commonly called the\r\n_honest_ and _industrious_.\" But this plan,--which not even\r\nSwift, independent as was his humor of the artifices of style, could\r\nadhere to,--was soon abandoned, and there is in most of Sheridan's own\r\npapers a finesse and ingenuity of allusion, which only the most\r\ncultivated part of his readers could fully enjoy. For instance, in\r\nexposing the inconsistency of Lord North, who had lately consented in a\r\nCommittee of the whole House, to a motion which he had violently opposed\r\nin the House itself,--thus \"making (says Sheridan) that respectable\r\nassembly disobey its own orders, and the members reject with contempt,\r\nunder the form of a Chairman, the resolutions they had imposed on\r\nthemselves under the authority of a Speaker;\"--he proceeds in a strain\r\nof refined raillery, as little suited to the \"honest and industrious\"\r\nclass of the community, as Swift's references to Locke, Molyneux, and\r\nSydney, were to the readers for whom he also professed to write:--\r\n\r\n\"The burlesque of any plan, I know, is rather a recommendation of it to\r\nYour Lordship; and the ridicule you might throw on this assembly, by\r\ncontinuing to support this Athanasian distinction of powers in the unity\r\nof an apparently corporate body, might in the end compensate to you for\r\nthe discredit you have incurred in the attempt.\r\n\r\n\"A deliberative body of so _uncommon a form_, would probably be\r\ndeemed a kind of STATE MONSTER by the ignorant and the vulgar. This\r\nmight at first increase their _awe_ for it, and so far counteract\r\nYour Lordship's intentions. They would probably approach it with as much\r\nreverence as Stephano does the monster in the Tempest:--'What, one body\r\nand two voices--a most delicate monster!' However, they would soon grow\r\nfamiliarized to it, and probably hold it in as little respect as they\r\nwere wished to do. They would find it on many occasions 'a very shallow\r\nmonster,' and particularly 'a most poor _credulous_ monster,'--\r\nwhile Your Lordship, as keeper, would enjoy every advantage and profit\r\nthat could be made of it. You would have the benefit of the _two\r\nvoices_, which would be the MONSTER'S great excellencies, and would\r\nbe peculiarly serviceable to Your Lordship. With 'the forward voice' you\r\nwould aptly promulgate those vigorous schemes and productive resources,\r\nin which Your Lordship's fancy is so pregnant; while 'the backward\r\nvoice' might be kept solely for _recantation_. The MONSTER, to\r\nmaintain its character, must appear no novice in the science of\r\nflattery, or in the talents of servility,--and while it could never\r\nscruple to bear any burdens Your Lordship should please to lay on it,\r\nyou would always, on the _approach of a storm_, find a shelter\r\nunder its gabardine.\"\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these papers was the attack upon Lord George\r\nGermaine, written also by Mr. Sheridan,--a composition which, for\r\nunaffected strength of style and earnestness of feeling, may claim a\r\nhigh rank among the models of political vituperation. To every\r\ngeneration its own contemporary press seems always more licentious than\r\nany that had preceded it; but it may be questioned, whether the boldness\r\nof modern libel has ever gone beyond the direct and undisguised\r\npersonality, with which one cabinet minister was called a liar and\r\nanother a coward, in this and other writings of the popular party at\r\nthat period. The following is the concluding paragraph of this paper\r\nagainst Lord George Germaine, which is in the form of a Letter to the\r\nFreeholders of England:--\r\n\r\n\"It would be presuming too much on your attention, at present, to enter\r\ninto an investigation of the measures and system of war which this\r\nminister has pursued,--these shall certainly be the subject of a future\r\npaper. At present I shall only observe that, however mortifying it may\r\nbe to reflect on the ignominy and disasters which this inauspicious\r\ncharacter has brought on his country, yet there are consoling\r\ncircumstances to be drawn even from his ill success. The calamities\r\nwhich may be laid to his account are certainly great; but, had the case\r\nbeen otherwise, it may fairly be questioned whether the example of a\r\ndegraded and reprobated officer (preposterously elevated to one of the\r\nfirst stations of honor and confidence in the state) directing the\r\nmilitary enterprises of this country with unlooked-for prosperity, might\r\nnot ultimately be the cause of more extensive evils than even those,\r\ngreat as they are, which we at present experience: whether from so fatal\r\na precedent we might not be led to introduce characters under similar\r\ndisqualifications into every department:--to appoint Atheists to the\r\nmitre, _Jews_ to the exchequer,--to select a treasury-bench from\r\nthe _Justitia_, to place _Brown Dignam_ on the wool-sack, and\r\nSir Hugh Palliser at the head of the admiralty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, as might be expected from the pursuits and habits of\r\nthose concerned in it, was not very punctually conducted, and after many\r\napologies from the publisher for its not appearing at the stated times,\r\n(Wednesdays and Saturdays,) ceased altogether on the 2d of June. From an\r\nimperfect sketch of a new Number, found among Mr. Sheridan's\r\nmanuscripts, it appears that there was an intention of reviving it a\r\nshort time after--probably towards the autumn of the same year, from\r\nthe following allusion to Mr. Gibbon, whose acceptance of a seat at the\r\nBoard of Trade took place, if I recollect right, in the summer of 1779:--\r\n\r\n\"This policy is very evident among the majority in both houses, who,\r\nthough they make no scruple in private to acknowledge the total\r\nincapacity of ministers, yet, in public, speak and vote as if they\r\nbelieved them to have every virtue under heaven; and, on this principle,\r\nsome gentlemen,--as Mr. Gibbon, for instance,--while, in private, they\r\nindulge their opinion pretty freely, will yet, in their zeal for the\r\npublic good, even condescend to accept a place, in order to give a color\r\nto their confidence in the wisdom of the government.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that Mr. Sheridan had been for some time among the\r\nmost welcome guests at Devonshire House--that rendezvous of all the\r\nwits and beauties of fashionable life, where Politics was taught to wear\r\nits most attractive form, and sat enthroned, like Virtue among the\r\nEpicureans, with all the graces and pleasures for handmaids.\r\n\r\nWithout any disparagement of the manly and useful talents, which are at\r\npresent no where more conspicuous than in the upper ranks of society, it\r\nmay be owned that for wit, social powers, and literary accomplishments,\r\nthe political men of the period under consideration formed such an\r\nassemblage as it would be flattery to say that our own times can\r\nparallel. The natural tendency of the excesses of the French Revolution\r\nwas to produce in the higher classes of England an increased reserve of\r\nmanner, and, of course, a proportionate restraint on all within their\r\ncircle, which have been fatal to conviviality and humor, and not very\r\npropitious to wit--subduing both manners and conversation to a sort of\r\npolished level, to rise above which is often thought almost as vulgar as\r\nto sink below it. Of the greater ease of manners that existed some forty\r\nor fifty years ago, one trifling, but not the less significant,\r\nindication was the habit, then prevalent among men of high station, of\r\ncalling each other by such familiar names as Dick, Jack, Tom, &c.\r\n[Footnote: Dick Sheridan, Ned Burke, Jack Townshend, Tom Grenville, &c.\r\n&c.]--a mode of address that brings with it, in its very sound, the\r\nnotion of conviviality and playfulness, and, however unrefined, implies,\r\nat least, that ease and _sea-room_, in which wit spreads its canvas\r\nmost fearlessly.\r\n\r\nWith respect to literary accomplishments, too,--in one branch of which,\r\npoetry, almost all the leading politicians of that day distinguished\r\nthemselves--the change that has taken place in the times, independently\r\nof any want of such talent, will fully account for the difference that\r\nwe witness, in this respect, at present. As the public mind becomes more\r\nintelligent and watchful, statesmen can the less afford to trifle with\r\ntheir talents, or to bring suspicion upon their fitness for their own\r\nvocation, by the failures which they risk in deviating into others.\r\nBesides, in poetry, the temptation of distinction no longer exists--the\r\ncommonness of that talent in the market, at present, being such as to\r\nreduce the value of an elegant copy of verses very far below the price\r\nit was at, when Mr. Hayley enjoyed an almost exclusive monopoly of the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nIn the clever Epistle, by Tickell, \"from the Hon. Charles Fox,\r\npartridge-shooting, to the Hon. John Townshend, cruising,\" some of the\r\nmost shining persons in that assemblage of wits and statesmen, who gave\r\na lustre to Brooks's Club-House at the period of which we are speaking,\r\nare thus agreeably grouped:--\r\n\r\n  \"Soon as to Brooks's thence thy footsteps bend,\r\n[Footnote: The well-known lines on Brooks himself are perhaps the\r\nperfection of this drawing-room style of humor:--\r\n\r\n  \"And know, I've bought the best champagne from Brooks;\r\n  From liberal Brooks, whose speculative skill\r\n  Is hasty credit, and a distant bill;\r\n  Who, nurs'd in clubs, disdains a vulgar trade,\r\n  Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid.\"]\r\n  What gratulations thy approach attend!\r\n  See Gibbon rap his box-auspicious sign\r\n  That classic compliment and wit combine;\r\n  See Beauclerk's cheek a tinge of red surprise,\r\n  And friendship give what cruel health denies;--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  On that auspicious night, supremely grac'd\r\n  With chosen guests, the pride of liberal taste,\r\n  Not in contentious heat, nor madd'ning strife,\r\n  Not with the busy ills, nor cares of life,\r\n  We'll waste the fleeting hours--far happier themes\r\n  Shall claim each thought and chase ambition's dreams.\r\n  Each _beauty_ that _sublimity_ can boast\r\n  _He_ best shall tell, who still unites them most.\r\n  Of wit, of taste, of fancy we'll debate,\r\n  If Sheridan, for once, be not too late:\r\n  But scarce a thought on politics we'll spare,\r\n  Unless on Polish politics, with Hare.\r\n  Good-natur'd Devon! oft shall then appear\r\n  The cool complacence of thy friendly sneer:\r\n  Oft shall Fitzpatrick's wit and Stanhope's case\r\n  And Burgoyne's manly sense unite to please.\r\n  And while each guest attends our varied feats\r\n  Of scattered covies and retreating fleets,\r\n  Me shall they wish some better sport to gain,\r\n  And Thee more glory, from the next campaign.\"\r\n\r\nIn the society of such men the destiny of Mr. Sheridan could not be long\r\nin fixing. On the one side, his own keen thirst for distinction, and on\r\nthe other, a quick and sanguine appreciation of the service that such\r\ntalents might render in the warfare of party, could not fail to hasten\r\nthe result that both desired.\r\n\r\nHis first appearance before the public as a political character was in\r\nconjunction with Mr. Fox, at the beginning of the year 1780, when the\r\nfamous Resolutions on the State of the Representation, signed by Mr. Fox\r\nas chairman of the Westminster Committee, together with a Report on the\r\nsame subject from the Sub-committee, signed by Sheridan, were laid\r\nbefore the public. Annual Parliaments and Universal Suffrage were the\r\nprofessed objects of this meeting; and the first of the Resolutions,\r\nsubscribed by Mr. Fox, stated that \"Annual Parliaments are the undoubted\r\nright of the people of England.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this strong declaration, it may be doubted whether\r\nSheridan was, any more than Mr. Fox, a very sincere friend to the\r\nprinciple of Reform; and the manner in which he masked his\r\ndisinclination or indifference to it was strongly characteristic both of\r\nhis humor and his tact. Aware that the wild scheme of Cartwright and\r\nothers, which these resolutions recommended, was wholly impracticable,\r\nhe always took refuge in it when pressed upon the subject, and would\r\nlaughingly advise his political friends to do the same:--\"Whenever any\r\none,\" he would say, \"proposes to you a specific plan of Reform, always\r\nanswer that you are for nothing short of Annual Parliaments and\r\nUniversal Suffrage--there you are safe.\" He also had evident delight,\r\nwhen talking on this question, in referring to a jest of Burke, who said\r\nthat there had arisen a new party of Reformers, still more orthodox than\r\nthe rest, who thought Annual Parliaments far from being sufficiently\r\nfrequent, and who, founding themselves upon the latter words of the\r\nstatute of Edward III., that \"a parliament shall be holden every year\r\nonce and _more often if need be_\" were known by the denomination of\r\nthe _Oftener-if-need-bes_. \"For my part,\" he would add, in relating\r\nthis, \"I am an Oftener-if-need-be.\" Even when most serious on the\r\nsubject (for, to the last he professed himself a warm friend to Reform)\r\nhis arguments had the air of being ironical and insidious. To Annual\r\nParliaments and Universal Suffrage, he would say, the principles of\r\nrepresentation naturally and necessarily led,--any less extensive\r\nproposition was a base compromise and a dereliction of right; and the\r\nfirst encroachment on the people was the Act of Henry VI., which limited\r\nthe power of election to forty-shilling freeholders within the county,\r\nwhereas the real right was in the \"outrageous and excessive\" number of\r\npeople by whom the preamble recites [Footnote: \"Elections of knights of\r\nshires have now of late been made by very great outrageous and excessive\r\nnumber of people, dwelling within the same counties, of the which most\r\npart was people of small substance and of no value.\" 8 H. 6. c. 7.] that\r\nthe choice had been made of late.--Such were the arguments by which he\r\naffected to support his cause, and it is not difficult to detect the\r\neyes of the snake glistening from under them.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of parliament that took place in the autumn of this year\r\n(1780) afforded at length the opportunity to which his ambition had so\r\neagerly looked forward. It has been said, I know not with what accuracy,\r\nthat he first tried his chance of election at Honiton--but Stafford was\r\nthe place destined to have the honor of first choosing him for its\r\nrepresentative; and it must have been no small gratification to his\r\nindependent spirit, that, unfurnished as he was with claims from past\r\npolitical services, he appeared in parliament, not as the nominee of any\r\naristocratic patron, but as member for a borough, which, whatever might\r\nbe its purity in other respects, at least enjoyed the freedom of choice.\r\nElected conjointly with Mr. Monckton, to whose interest and exertions he\r\nchiefly owed his success, he took his seat in the new parliament which\r\nmet in the month of October;--and, from that moment giving himself up to\r\nthe pursuit of politics, bid adieu to the worship of the Dramatic Muse\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\n  \"_Comoedia luget;\r\n  Scena est deserta: hinc ludus risusque jocusgue\r\n  Et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt._\"\r\n\r\n  Comedy mourns--the Stage neglected sleeps--\r\n  E'en Mirth in tears his languid laughter steeps--\r\n  And Song, through all her various empire, weeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUNFINISHED PLAYS AND POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the sketch of Mr. Sheridan's political life, I shall\r\ntake this opportunity of laying before the reader such information with\r\nrespect to his unfinished literary designs, both dramatic and poetic, as\r\nthe papers in my possession enable me to communicate.\r\n\r\nSome of his youthful attempts in literature have already been mentioned,\r\nand there is a dramatic sketch of his, founded on the Vicar of\r\nWakefield, which from a date on the manuscript (1768), appears to have\r\nbeen produced at a still earlier age, and when he was only in his\r\nseventeenth year. A scene of this piece will be sufficient to show how\r\nvery soon his talent for lively dialogue displayed itself:--\r\n\r\n\"SCENE II.\r\n\r\n\"THORNHILL _and_ ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\"_Thornhill._ Nay, prithee, Jack, no more of that if you love me.\r\nWhat, shall I stop short with the game in full view? Faith, I believe\r\nthe fellow's turned puritan. What think you of turning methodist, Jack?\r\nYou have a tolerable good canting countenance, and, if escaped being\r\ntaken up for a Jesuit, you might make a fortune in Moor-fields.\r\n\r\n\"_Arnold._ I was serious, Tom.\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ Splenetic you mean. Come, fill your glass, and a truce to\r\nyour preaching. Here's a pretty fellow has let his conscience sleep for\r\nthese five years, and has now plucked morality from the leaves of his\r\ngrandmother's bible, beginning to declaim against what he has practised\r\nhalf his life-time. Why, I tell you once more, my schemes are all come\r\nto perfection. I am now convinced Olivia loves me--at our last\r\nconversation, she said she would rely wholly on my honor.\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ And therefore you would deceive her.\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ Why no--deceive her?--why--indeed--as to that--but--but,\r\nfor God's sake, let me hear no more on this subject, for, 'faith, you\r\nmake me sad, Jack. If you continue your admonitions, I shall begin to\r\nthink you have yourself an eye on the girl. You have promised me your\r\nassistance, and when you came down into the country, were as hot on the\r\nscheme as myself: but, since you have been two or three times with me at\r\nPrimrose's, you have fallen off strangely. No encroachments, Jack, on my\r\nlittle rose-bud--if you have a mind to beat up game in this quarter,\r\nthere's her sister--but no poaching.\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ I am not insensible to her sister's merit, but have no such\r\nviews as you have. However, you have promised me that if you find in this\r\nlady that real virtue which you so firmly deny to exist in the sex, you\r\nwill give up the pursuit, and, foregoing the low considerations of fortune,\r\nmake atonement by marriage.\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ Such is my serious resolution.\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ I wish you'd forego the experiment. But, you have been so\r\nmuch in raptures with your success, that I have, as yet, had no clear\r\naccount how you came acquainted in the family.\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ Oh, I'll tell you immediately. You know Lady Patchet?\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ What, is she here?\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ It was by her I was first introduced. It seems that, last\r\nyear, her ladyship's reputation began to suffer a little; so that she\r\nthought it prudent to retire for a while, till people learned better\r\nmanners or got worse memories. She soon became acquainted with this\r\nlittle family, and, as the wife is a prodigious admirer of quality, grew\r\nin a short time to be very intimate, and imagining that she may one day\r\nmake her market of the girls, has much ingratiated herself with them.\r\nShe introduced me--I drank, and abused this degenerate age with the\r\nfather--promised wonders to the mother for all her brats--praised her\r\ngooseberry wine, and ogled the daughters, by which means in three days I\r\nmade the progress I related to you.\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ You have been expeditious indeed. I fear where that devil\r\nLady Patchet is concerned there can be no good--but is there not a son?\r\n\r\n\"_Thorn._ Oh! the most ridiculous creature in nature. He has been\r\nbred in the country a bumpkin all his life, till within these six years,\r\nwhen he was sent to the University, but the misfortunes that have\r\nreduced his father falling out, he is returned, the most ridiculous\r\nanimal you ever saw, a conceited, disputing blockhead. So there is no\r\ngreat matter to fear from _his_ penetration. But come, let us\r\nbegone, and see this moral family, we shall meet them coming from the\r\nfield, and you will see a man who was once in affluence, maintaining by\r\nhard labor a numerous family.\r\n\r\n\"_Arn._ Oh! Thornhill, can you wish to add infamy to their poverty?\r\n\r\n\"[Exeunt.]\"\r\n\r\nThere also remain among his papers three Acts of a Drama, without a\r\nname,--written evidently in haste, and with scarcely any correction,--\r\nthe subject of which is so wild and unmanageable, that I should not have\r\nhesitated in referring it to the same early date, had not the\r\nintroduction into one of the scenes of \"Dry be that tear, be hush'd that\r\nsigh,\" proved it to have been produced after that pretty song was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe chief personages upon whom the story turns are a band of outlaws,\r\nwho, under the name and disguise of _Devils_, have taken up their\r\nresidence in a gloomy wood, adjoining a village, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich they keep in perpetual alarm by their incursions and apparitions.\r\nIn the same wood resides a hermit, secretly connected with this band,\r\nwho keeps secluded within his cave the beautiful Reginilla, hid alike\r\nfrom the light of the sun and the eyes of men. She has, however, been\r\nindulged in her prison with a glimpse of a handsome young huntsman, whom\r\nshe believes to be a phantom, and is encouraged in her belief by the\r\nhermit, by whose contrivance this huntsman (a prince in disguise) has\r\nbeen thus presented to her. The following is--as well as I can make it\r\nout from a manuscript not easily decipherable--the scene that takes\r\nplace between the fair recluse and her visitant. The style, where style\r\nis attempted, shows, as the reader will perceive, a taste yet immature\r\nand unchastened:--\r\n\r\n\"_Scene draws, and discovers_ REGINILLA _asleep in the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Enter_ PEVIDOR _and other Devils, with the_ HUNTSMAN--_unbind\r\nhim, and exeunt._\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Ha! Where am I now? Is it indeed the dread abode of\r\nguilt, or refuge of a band of thieves? it cannot be a dream (_sees_\r\nREGINILLA.) Ha! if this be so, and I _do_ dream, may I never wake--\r\nit is--my beating heart acknowledges my dear, gentle Reginilla. I'll not\r\nwake her, lest, if it be a phantom, it should vanish. Oh, balmy breath!\r\nbut for thy soft sighs that come to tell me it is no image, I should\r\nbelieve ... (_bends down towards her_.) a sigh from her heart!--\r\nthus let me arrest thee on thy way. (_kisses her_.) A deeper blush\r\nhas flushed her cheek--sweet modesty! that even in sleep is conscious\r\nand resentful.--She will not wake, and yet some fancy calls up those\r\nfrequent sighs--how her heart beats in its ivory cage, like an\r\nimprisoned bird--or as if to reprove the hand that dares approach its\r\nsanctuary! Oh, would she but wake, and bless this gloom with her bright\r\neyes!--Soft, here's a lute--perhaps her soul will hear the call of\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh yield, fair lids, the treasures of my heart,\r\n  Release those beams, that make this mansion bright;\r\n  From her sweet sense, Slumber! tho' sweet thou art,\r\n  Begone, and give the air she breathes in light.\r\n\r\n  \"Or while, oh Sleep, thou dost those glances hide,\r\n  Let rosy slumbers still around her play,\r\n  Sweet as the cherub Innocence enjoy'd,\r\n  When in thy lap, new-born, in smiles he lay.\r\n\r\n  \"And thou, oh Dream, that com'st her sleep to cheer,\r\n  Oh take my shape, and play a lover's part;\r\n  Kiss her from me, and whisper in her ear,\r\n  Till her eyes shine, 'tis night within my heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: I have taken the liberty here of supplying a few rhymes and\r\nwords that are wanting in the original copy of the song. The last line\r\nof all runs thus in the manuscript:--\r\n\r\n  \"Till her eye shines I live in darkest night,\"\r\n\r\nwhich, not rhyming as it ought, I have ventured to alter as above.]\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ (_waking_.) The phantom, father! (_seizes his\r\nhand._) ah, do not, do not wake me then. (_rises._)\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ (_kneeling to her._) Thou beauteous sun of this dark\r\nworld, that mak'st a place, so like the cave of death, a heaven to me,\r\ninstruct me how I may approach thee--how address thee and not offend.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Oh how my soul would hang upon those lips! speak on--and\r\nyet, methinks, he should not kneel so--why are you afraid, Sir? indeed,\r\nI cannot hurt you.\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Sweet innocence, I'm sure thou would'st not.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Art thou not he to whom I told my name, and didst thou not\r\nsay thine was--\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Oh blessed be the name that then thou told'st--it has\r\nbeen ever since my charm, and kept me from distraction. But, may I ask\r\nhow such sweet excellence as thine could be hid in such a place?\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Alas, I know not--for such as thou I never saw before, nor\r\nany like myself.\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Nor like thee ever shall--but would'st thou leave this\r\nplace, and live with such as I am?\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Why may not you live here with such as I?\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Yes--but I would carry thee where all above an azure\r\ncanopy extends, at night bedropt with gems, and one more glorious lamp,\r\nthat yields such bashful light as love enjoys--while underneath, a\r\ncarpet shall be spread of flowers to court the pressure of thy step,\r\nwith such sweet whispered invitations from the leaves of shady groves or\r\nmurmuring of silver streams, that thou shalt think thou art in Paradise.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Indeed!\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Ay, and I'll watch and wait on thee all day, and cull the\r\nchoicest flowers, which while thou bind'st in the mysterious knot of\r\nlove, I'll tune for thee no vulgar lays, or tell thee tales shall make\r\nthee weep yet please thee--while thus I press thy hand, and warm it thus\r\nwith kisses.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ I doubt thee not--but then my Governor has told me many a\r\ntale of faithless men who court a lady but to steal her peace and fame,\r\nand then to leave her.\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Oh never such as thou art--witness all....\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Then wherefore couldst thou not live here? For I do feel,\r\ntho' tenfold darkness did surround this spot, I could be blest, would\r\nyou but stay here; and, if it made you sad to be imprison'd thus, I'd\r\nsing and play for thee, and dress thee sweetest fruits, and though you\r\nchid me, would kiss thy tear away and hide my blushing face upon thy\r\nbosom--indeed, I would. Then what avails the gaudy day, and all the evil\r\nthings I'm told inhabit there, to those who have within themselves all\r\nthat delight and love, and heaven can give.\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ My angel, thou hast indeed the soul of love.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ It is no ill thing, is it?\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ Oh most divine--it is the immediate gift of heaven, which\r\nsteals into our breast ... 'tis that which makes me sigh thus, look\r\nthus--fear and tremble for thee.\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ Sure I should learn it too, if you would teach me.\r\n\r\n(_Sound of horn without--Huntsman starts._)\r\n\r\n\"_Reg._ You must not go--this is but a dance preparing for my\r\namusement--oh we have, indeed, some pleasures here--come, I will sing\r\nfor you the while.\r\n\r\n\"_Song._\r\n\r\n  \"Wilt thou then leave me? canst thou go from me,\r\n    To woo the fair that love the gaudy day?\r\n  Yet, e'en among those joys, thou'lt find that she,\r\n    Who dwells in darkness, loves thee more than they.\r\n  For these poor hands, and these unpractised eyes,\r\n  And this poor heart is thine without disguise.\r\n\r\n  But, if thou'lt stay with me, my only care\r\n    Shall be to please and make thee love to stay,\r\n  With music, song, and dance\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  But, if you go, nor music, song, nor dance,\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If thou art studious, I will read\r\n    Thee tales of pleasing woe--\r\n  If thou art sad, I'll kiss away\r\n    The tears.... that flow.\r\n\r\n  If thou would'st play, I'll kiss thee till I blush,\r\n    Then hide that blush upon thy breast,\r\n  If thou would'st sleep....\r\n    Shall rock thy aching head to rest.\r\n\r\n\"_Hunts._ My soul's wonder, I will never leave thee.\r\n\r\n\"(_The Dance.--Allemande by two Bears_.)\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ PEVIDOR.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ So fond, so soon! I cannot bear to see it. What ho, within\r\n(_Devils enter._) secure him. (_Seize and bind the Huntsman._)\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke or sovereign of the country, where these events are supposed to\r\ntake place, arrives at the head of a military force, for the purpose of\r\ninvesting the haunted wood, and putting down, as he says, those \"lawless\r\nrenegades, who, in infernal masquerade, make a hell around him.\" He is\r\nalso desirous of consulting the holy hermit of the wood, and availing\r\nhimself of his pious consolations and prayers--being haunted with\r\nremorse for having criminally gained possession of the crown by\r\ncontriving the shipwreck of the rightful heir, and then banishing from\r\nthe court his most virtuous counsellors. In addition to these causes of\r\ndisquietude, he has lately lost, in a mysterious manner, his only son,\r\nwho, he supposes, has fallen a victim to these Satanic outlaws, but who,\r\non the contrary, it appears, has voluntarily become an associate of\r\ntheir band, and is amusing himself, heedless of his noble father's\r\nsorrow, by making love, in the disguise of a dancing bear, to a young\r\nvillage coquette of the name of Mopsa. A short specimen of the manner in\r\nwhich this last farcical incident is managed, will show how wide even\r\nSheridan was, at first, of that true vein of comedy, which, on searching\r\ndeeper into the mine, he so soon afterwards found:--\r\n\r\n\"SCENE.--_The Inside of the Cottage_.--MOPSA, LUBIN _(her\r\nfather), and_ COLIN _(her lover), discovered_.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ PEVIDOR, _leading the Bear, and singing._\r\n\r\n  \"And he dances, dances, dances,\r\n    And goes upright like a Christian swain,\r\n  And he shows you pretty fancies,\r\n    Nor ever tries to shake off his chain.\r\n\r\n\"_Lubin._ Servant, master. Now, Mopsa, you are happy--it is,\r\nindeed, a handsome creature. What country does your bear come from?\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ Dis bear, please your worship, is of de race of dat bear of\r\nSt. Anthony, who was the first convert he made in de woods. St. Anthony\r\nbade him never more meddle with man, and de bear observed de command to\r\nhis dying day.\r\n\r\n\"_Lub._ Wonderful!\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ Dis generation be all de same--all born widout toots.\r\n\r\n\"_Colin._ What, can't he bite?

(_Mopsa laughs_.)\r\n\r\n\"_Col._ For shame, Mopsa--now, I say Maister Lubin, mustn't she\r\ngive me a kiss to make it well?\r\n\r\n\"_Lub._ Ay, kiss her, kiss her, Colin.\r\n\r\n\"_Col._ Come, Miss. (_Mopsa runs to the Bear, who kisses\r\nher_.)\"\r\n\r\nThe following scene of the Devils drinking in their subterraneous\r\ndwelling, though cleverly imagined, is such as, perhaps, no cookery of\r\nstyle could render palatable to an English audience.\r\n\r\n\"SCENE.--_The Devils' Cave_.\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ Come, Urial, here's to our resurrection.\r\n\r\n\"_2d Dev._ It is a toast I'd scarcely pledge--by my life, I think\r\nwe're happier here.\r\n\r\n\"_3d Dev._ Why, so think I--by Jove, I would despise the man, who\r\ncould but wish to rise again to earth, unless we were to lord there.\r\nWhat! sneaking pitiful in bondage, among vile money-scrapers,\r\ntreacherous friends, fawning flatterers--or, still worse, deceitful\r\nmistresses. Shall we who reign lords here, again lend ourselves to swell\r\nthe train of tyranny and usurpation? By my old father's memory, I'd\r\nrather be the blindest mole that ever skulked in darkness, the lord of\r\none poor hole, where he might say, 'I'm master here.'\r\n\r\n\"_2d Dev._ You are too hot--where shall concord be found, if even\r\nthe devils disagree?--Come fill the glass, and add thy harmony--while we\r\nhave wine to enlighten us, the sun be hanged! I never thought he gave so\r\nfine a light for my part--and then, there are such vile inconveniences--\r\nhigh winds and storms, rains, &c.--oh hang it! living on the outside of\r\nthe earth is like sleeping on deck, when one might, like us, have a snug\r\nberth in the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ True, true,--Helial, where is thy catch?\r\n\r\n  \"In the earth's centre let me live,\r\n    There, like a rabbit will I thrive,\r\n  Nor care if fools should call my life infernal;\r\n    While men on earth crawl lazily about,\r\n    Like snails upon the surface of the nut,\r\n  We are, like maggots, feasting in the kernel.\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ Bravo, by this glass. Meli, what say you?\r\n\r\n\"_3d Dev._ Come, here's to my Mina--I used to toast her in the\r\nupper regions.\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ Ay, we miss them here.\r\n\r\n\"_Glee._\r\n\r\n  \"What's a woman good for?\r\n  Rat me, sir, if I know.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  She's a savor to the glass,\r\n  An excuse to make it pass.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ I fear we are like the wits above, who abuse women only\r\nbecause they can't get them,--and, after all, it must be owned they are\r\na pretty kind of creatures.\r\n\r\n\"_All._ Yes, yes.\r\n\r\n\"_Catch._\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis woman after all\r\n    Is the blessing of this ball,\r\n  'Tis she keeps the balance of it even.\r\n    We are devils, it is true,\r\n    But had we women too,\r\n  Our Tartarus would turn to a Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nA scene in the Third Act, where these devils bring the prisoners whom\r\nthey have captured to trial, is an overcharged imitation of the satire\r\nof Fielding, and must have been written, I think, after a perusal of\r\nthat author's Satirical Romance, \"A Journey from this World to the\r\nNext,\"--the first half of which contains as much genuine humor and fancy\r\nas are to be found in any other production of the kind. The\r\ninterrogatories of Minos in that work suggested, I suspect, the\r\nfollowing scene:--\r\n\r\n\"_Enter a number of Devils.--Others bring in_ LUDOVICO.\r\n\r\n\"_1st Dev._ Just taken, in the wood, sir, with two more.\r\n\r\n  \"_Chorus of Devils_.\r\n\r\n  \"Welcome, welcome\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ What art thou?\r\n\r\n\"_Ludov._ I went for a man in the other world.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ What sort of a man?\r\n\r\n\"_Ludov._ A soldier at your service.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ Wast thou in the battle of--?\r\n\r\n\"_Ludov._ Truly I was.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ What was the quarrel?\r\n\r\n\"_Ludov._ I never had time to ask.

This is Hell certainly by the\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ What, art thou a soldier too?\r\n\r\n\"_Pamphil._ No, on my life--a Colonel, but no soldier--innocent\r\neven of a review, as I exist.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ How rose you then? come, come--the truth.\r\n\r\n\"_Pamphil._ Nay, be not angry, sir--if I was preferred it was not\r\nmy fault--upon my soul, I never did anything to incur preferment.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ Indeed! what was thy employment then, friend?\r\n\r\n\"_Pamphil._ Hunting--\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ 'Tis false.\r\n\r\n\"_Pamphil._ Hunting women's reputations.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ What, thou wert amorous?\r\n\r\n\"_Pamphil._ No, on my honor, sir, but vain, confounded vain--the\r\ncharacter of bringing down my game was all I wished, and, like a true\r\nsportsman, I would have given my birds to my pointers.\r\n\r\n\"_Pev._ This crime is new--what shall we do with him?\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis singular Drama does not appear to have been ever finished. With\r\nrespect to the winding up of the story, the hermit, we may conclude,\r\nwould have turned out to be the banished counsellor, and the devils, his\r\nfollowers; while the young huntsman would most probably have proved to\r\nbe the rightful heir of the dukedom.\r\n\r\nIn a more crude and unfinished state are the fragments that remain of\r\nhis projected opera of \"The Foresters.\" To this piece (which appears to\r\nhave been undertaken at a later period than the preceding one) Mr.\r\nSheridan often alluded in conversation--particularly when any regret was\r\nexpressed at his having ceased to assist Old Drury with his pen,--\"wait\r\n(he would say smiling) till I bring out my Foresters.\" The plot, as far\r\nas can be judged from the few meagre scenes that exist, was intended to\r\nbe an improvement upon that of the Drama just described--the Devils\r\nbeing transformed into Foresters, and the action commencing, not with\r\nthe loss of a son, but the recovery of a daughter, who had fallen by\r\naccident into the hands of these free-booters. At the opening of the\r\npiece the young lady has just been restored to her father by the heroic\r\nCaptain of the Foresters, with no other loss than that of her heart,\r\nwhich she is suspected of having left with her preserver. The list of\r\nthe Dramatis Personae (to which however he did not afterwards adhere) is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nOld Oscar.\r\n\r\nYoung Oscar.\r\n\r\nColona.\r\n\r\nMorven.\r\n\r\nHarold.\r\n\r\nNico.\r\n\r\nMiza.\r\n\r\nMalvina.\r\n\r\nAllanda.\r\n\r\nDorcas.\r\n\r\nEmma.\r\n\r\nTo this strange medley of nomenclature is appended a memorandum--\r\n\"_Vide_ Petrarch for names.\"\r\n\r\nThe first scene represents the numerous lovers of Malvina rejoicing at\r\nher return, and celebrating it by a chorus; after which Oscar, her\r\nfather, holds the following dialogue with one of them:--\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ I thought, son, you would have been among the first and\r\nmost eager to see Malvina upon her return.\r\n\r\n\"_Colin._ Oh, father, I would give half my flock to think that my\r\npresence would be welcome to her.\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ I am sure you have never seen her prefer any one else.\r\n\r\n\"_Col._ There's the torment of it--were I but once sure that she\r\nloved another better, I think I should be content--at least she should\r\nnot know but that I was so. My love is not of that jealous sort that I\r\nshould pine to see her happy with another--nay, I could even regard the\r\nman that would make her so.\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ Haven't you spoke with her since her return?\r\n\r\n\"_Col._ Yes, and I think she is colder to me than ever. My\r\nprofessions of love used formerly to make her laugh, but now they make\r\nher weep--formerly she seemed wholly insensible; now, alas, she seems\r\nto feel--but as if addressed by the wrong person,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn a following scene are introduced two brothers, both equally enamored\r\nof the fair Malvina, yet preserving their affection unaltered towards\r\neach other. With the recollection of Sheridan's own story fresh in our\r\nminds, we might suppose that he meant some reference to it in this\r\nincident, were it not for the exceeding _niaiserie_ that he has\r\nthrown into the dialogue. For instance:--\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ But we are interrupted--here are two more of her lovers--\r\nbrothers, and rivals, but friends.\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ NICO _and_ LUBIN.\r\n\r\n\"So, Nico--how comes it you are so late in your inquiries after your\r\nmistress?\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ I should have been sooner; but Lubin would stay to make\r\nhimself fine--though he knows that he has no chance of appearing so to\r\nMalvina.\r\n\r\n\"_Lubin._ No, in truth--Nico says right--I have no more chance than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ However, I am glad to see you reconciled, and that you live\r\ntogether, as brothers should do.\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ Yes, ever since we found your daughter cared for neither\r\nof us, we grew to care for one another. There is a fellowship in\r\nadversity that is consoling; and it is something to think that Lubin is\r\nas unfortunate as myself.\r\n\r\n\"_Lub._ Yes, we are well matched--I think Malvina dislikes him, if\r\npossible, more than me, and that's a great comfort.\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ We often sit together, and play such woeful tunes on our\r\npipes, that the very sheep are moved at it.\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ But why don't you rouse yourselves, and, since you can meet\r\nwith no requital of your passion, return the proud maid scorn for scorn?\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ Oh mercy, no--we find a great comfort in our sorrow--don't\r\nwe, Lubin?\r\n\r\n\"_Lubin._ Yes, if I meet no crosses, I shall be undone in another\r\ntwelve-month--I let all go to wreck and ruin.\r\n\r\n\"_Osc._ But suppose Malvina should be brought to give you\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ Heaven forbid! that would spoil all.\r\n\r\n\"_Lubin._ Truly I was almost assured within this fortnight that she\r\nwas going to relax.\r\n\r\n\"_Nico._ Ay, I shall never forget how alarmed we were at the\r\nappearance of a smile one day,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOf the poetical part of this opera, the only specimens he has left are a\r\nskeleton of a chorus, beginning \"Bold Foresters we are,\" and the\r\nfollowing song, which, for grace and tenderness, is not unworthy of the\r\nhand that produced the Duenna:--\r\n\r\n  \"We two, each other's only pride,\r\n  Each other's bliss, each other's guide,\r\n  Far from the world's unhallow'd noise,\r\n  Its coarse delights and tainted joys,\r\n  Through wilds will roam and deserts rude--\r\n  For, Love, thy home is solitude.\r\n\r\n  \"There shall no vain pretender be,\r\n  To court thy smile and torture me,\r\n  No proud superior there be seen,\r\n  But nature's voice shall hail thee, queen.\r\n\r\n  \"With fond respect and tender awe,\r\n  I will receive thy gentle law,\r\n  Obey thy looks, and serve thee still,\r\n  Prevent thy wish, foresee thy will,\r\n  And, added to a lover's care,\r\n  Be all that friends and parents are.\"\r\n\r\nBut, of all Mr. Sheridan's unfinished designs, the Comedy which he\r\nmeditated on the subject of Affectation is that of which the abandonment\r\nis most to be regretted. To a satirist, who would not confine his\r\nridicule to the mere outward demonstrations of this folly, but would\r\nfollow and detect it through all its windings and disguises, there could\r\nhardly perhaps be a more fertile theme. Affectation, merely of\r\n_manner_, being itself a sort of acting, does not easily admit of\r\nany additional coloring on the stage, without degenerating into farce;\r\nand, accordingly, fops and fine ladies--with very few exceptions--are\r\nabout as silly and tiresome in representation as in reality. But the aim\r\nof the dramatist, in this comedy, would have been far more important and\r\nextensive;--and how anxious he was to keep before his mind's eye the\r\nwhole wide horizon of folly which his subject opened upon him, will\r\nappear from the following list of the various species of Affectation,\r\nwhich I have found written by him, exactly as I give it, on the inside\r\ncover of the memorandum-book, that contains the only remaining vestiges\r\nof this play:--\r\n\r\n\"An Affectation of Business.\r\n                of Accomplishments,\r\n                of Love of Letters and \"Wit\r\n                           Music.\r\n                of Intrigue.\r\n                of Sensibility.\r\n                of Vivacity.\r\n                of Silence and Importance.\r\n                of Modesty.\r\n                of Profligacy.\r\n                of Moroseness.\"\r\n\r\nIn this projected comedy he does not seem to have advanced as far as\r\neven the invention of the plot or the composition of a single scene. The\r\nmemorandum-book alluded to--on the first leaf of which he had written in\r\nhis neatest hand (as if to encourage himself to begin) \"Affectation\"--\r\ncontains, besides the names of three of the intended personages, Sir\r\nBabble Bore, Sir Peregrine Paradox, and Feignwit, nothing but unembodied\r\nsketches of character, and scattered particles of wit, which seem\r\nwaiting, like the imperfect forms and seeds in chaos, for the brooding\r\nof genius to nurse them into system and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not, I think, be displeased at seeing some of these\r\ncurious materials here. They will show that in this work, as well as in\r\nthe School for Scandal, he was desirous of making the vintage of his wit\r\nas rich as possible, by distilling into it every drop that the collected\r\nfruits of his thought and fancy could supply. Some of the jests are far-\r\nfetched, and others, perhaps, abortive--but it is pleasant to track him\r\nin his pursuit of a point, even when he misses. The very failures of a\r\nman of real wit are often more delightful than the best successes of\r\nothers--the quick-silver, even in escaping from his grasp, shines; \"it\r\nstill eludes him, but it glitters still.\"\r\n\r\nI shall give the memorandums as I find them, with no other difference,\r\nthan that of classing together those that have relation to the same\r\nthought or subject.\r\n\r\n\"_Character_--Mr. BUSTLE.\r\n\r\n\"A man who delights in hurry and interruption--will take any one's\r\nbusiness for them--leaves word where all his plagues may follow him--\r\ngovernor of all hospitals, &c.--share in Ranelagh--speaker every where,\r\nfrom the Vestry to the House of Commons--'I am not at home--gad, now he\r\nheard me and I must be at home.'--'Here am I so plagued, and there is\r\nnothing I love so much as retirement and quiet.'--'You never sent after\r\nme.'--Let servants call in to him such a message as 'Tis nothing but the\r\nwindow tax,' he hiding in a room that communicates.--A young man tells\r\nhim some important business in the middle of fifty trivial\r\ninterruptions, and the calling in of idlers; such as fidlers, wild-beast\r\nmen, foreigners with recommendatory letters, &c.--answers notes on his\r\nknee, 'and so your uncle died?--for your obliging inquiries--and left\r\nyou an orphan--to cards in the evening.'\r\n\r\n\"Can't bear to be doing nothing.--'Can I do anything for any body any\r\nwhere?'--'Have been to the Secretary--written to the Treasury.'--'Must\r\nproceed to meet the Commissioners, and write Mr. Price's little boy's\r\nexercise.'--The most active idler and laborious trifler.\r\n\r\n\"He does not in reality love business--only the appearance of it. 'Ha!\r\nha! did my Lord say that I was always very busy? What, plagued to\r\ndeath?'\r\n\r\n\"Keeps all his letters and copies--' Mem. to meet the Hackney-coach\r\nCommissioners--to arbitrate between,' &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\"Contrast with the man of indolence, his brother.--'So, brother, just\r\nup! and I have been,' &c. &c.--one will give his money from indolent\r\ngenerosity, the other his time from restlessness--' 'Twill be shorter to\r\npay the bill than look for the receipt.'--Files letters, answered and\r\nunanswered--'Why, here are more unopened than answered!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He regulates every action by a love for fashion--will grant annuities\r\nthough he doesn't want money--appear to intrigue, though constant; to\r\ndrink, though sober--has some fashionable vices--affects to be\r\ndistressed in his circumstances, and, when his new vis-a-vis comes out,\r\nprocures a judgment to be entered against him--wants to lose, but by\r\nill-luck wins five thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"One who changes sides in all arguments the moment any one agrees with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"An irresolute arguer, to whom it is a great misfortune that there are\r\nnot three sides to a question--a libertine in argument; conviction, like\r\nenjoyment, palls him, and his rakish understanding is soon satiated with\r\ntruth--more capable of being faithful to a paradox--'I love truth as I\r\ndo my wife; but sophistry and paradoxes are my mistresses--I have a\r\nstrong domestic respect for her, but for the other the passion due to a\r\nmistress.'\r\n\r\n\"One, who agrees with every one, for the pleasure of speaking their\r\nsentiments for them--so fond of talking that he does not contradict only\r\nbecause he can't wait to hear people out.\r\n\r\n\"A tripping casuist, who veers by others' breath, and gets on to\r\ninformation by tacking between the two sides--like a hoy, not made to go\r\nstraight before the wind.\r\n\r\n\"The more he talks, the further he is off the argument, like a bowl on a\r\nwrong bias.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What are the affectations you chiefly dislike?\r\n\r\n\"There are many in this company, so I'll mention others.--To see two\r\npeople affecting intrigue, having their assignations in public places\r\nonly; he affecting a warm pursuit, and the lady, acting the hesitation\r\nof retreating virtue--'Pray, ma'am, don't you think,' &c.--while neither\r\nparty have words between 'em to conduct the preliminaries of gallantry,\r\nnor passion to pursue the object of it.\r\n\r\n\"A plan of public flirtation--not to get beyond a profile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Then I hate to see one, to whom heaven has given real beauty, settling\r\nher features at the glass of fashion, while she speaks--not thinking so\r\nmuch of what she says as how she looks, and more careful of the action\r\nof her lips than of what shall come from them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A pretty woman studying looks and endeavoring to recollect an ogle,\r\nlike Lady ----, who has learned to play her eyelids like Venetian\r\nblinds. [Footnote: This simile is repeated in various shapes through his\r\nmanuscripts--\"She moves her eyes up and down like Venetian blinds\"--\r\n\"Her eyelids play like a Venetian blind,\" &c &c.]\r\n\r\n\"An old woman endeavoring to put herself back to a girl.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A true-trained wit lays his plan like a general--foresees the\r\ncircumstances of the conversation--surveys the ground and contingencies\r\n--detaches a question to draw you into the palpable ambuscade of his\r\nready-made joke.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A man intriguing, only for the reputation of it--to his confidential\r\nservant: 'Who am I in love with now?'--'The newspapers give you so and\r\nso--you are laying close siege to Lady L., in the Morning Post, and have\r\nsucceeded with Lady G. in the Herald--Sir F. is very jealous of you in\r\nthe Gazetteer.'--'Remember to-morrow the first thing you do, to put me\r\nin love with Mrs. C.'\r\n\r\n\"'I forgot to forget the billet-doux at Brooks's'--'By the bye, an't I\r\nin love with you?'--'Lady L. has promised to meet me in her carriage to-\r\nmorrow--where is the most public place?'\r\n\r\n\"'You were rude to her!'--'Oh, no, upon my soul, I made love to her\r\ndirectly.'\r\n\r\n\"An old man, who affects intrigue, and writes his own reproaches in the\r\nMorning Post, trying to scandalize himself into the reputation of being\r\nyoung, as if he could obscure his age by blotting his character--though\r\nnever so little candid as when he's abusing himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"'Shall you be at Lady ----'s?

[Footnote: The reader will find how much\r\nthis thought was improved upon afterwards.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A fat woman trundling into a room on castors--in sitting can only lean\r\nagainst her chair--rings on her fingers, and her fat arms strangled with\r\nbracelets, which belt them like corded brawn--rolling and heaving when\r\nshe laughs with the rattles in her throat, and a most apoplectic ogle--\r\nyou wish to draw her out, as you would an opera-glass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A long lean man with all his limbs rambling--no way to reduce him to\r\ncompass, unless you could double him like a pocket rule--with his arms\r\nspread, he'd lie on the bed of Ware like a cross on a Good Friday bun--\r\nstanding still, he is a pilaster without a base--he appears rolled out\r\nor run up against a wall--so thin that his front face is but the moiety\r\nof a profile--if he stands cross-legged, he looks like a caduceus, and\r\nput him in a fencing attitude, you will take him for a piece of chevaux-\r\nde-frise--to make any use of him, it must be as a spontoon or a fishing-\r\nrod--when his wife's by, he follows like a note of admiration--see them\r\ntogether, one's a mast, and the other all hulk--she's a dome and he's\r\nbuilt like a glass-house--when they part, you wonder to see the steeple\r\nseparate from the chancel, and were they to embrace, he must hang round\r\nher neck like a skein of thread on a lace-maker's bolster--to sing her\r\npraise you should choose a rondeau, and to celebrate him you must write\r\nall Alexandrines.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't give a pin to make fine men in love with me--every coquette\r\ncan do that, and the pain you give these creatures is very trifling. I\r\nlove out-of-the-way conquests; and as I think my attractions are\r\nsingular, I would draw singular objects.\r\n\r\n\"The loadstone of true beauty draws the heaviest substances--not like\r\nthe fat dowager, who frets herself into warmth to get the notice of a\r\nfew _papier mache_ fops, as you rub Dutch sealing-wax to draw\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"If I were inclined to flatter I would say that, as you are unlike other\r\nwomen, you ought not to be won as they are. Every woman can be gained by\r\ntime, therefore you ought to be by a sudden impulse. Sighs, devotion,\r\nattention weigh with others; but they are so much your due that no one\r\nshould claim merit from them....\r\n\r\n\"You should not be swayed by common motives--how heroic to form a\r\nmarriage for which no human being can guess the inducement--what a\r\nglorious unaccountableness! All the world will wonder what the devil you\r\ncould see in me; and, if you should doubt your singularity, I pledge\r\nmyself to you that I never yet was endured by woman; so that I should\r\nowe every thing to the effect of your bounty, and not by my own\r\nsuperfluous deserts make it a debt, and so lessen both the obligation\r\nand my gratitude. In short, every other woman follows her inclination,\r\nbut you, above all things, should take me, if you do not like me. You\r\nwill, besides, have the satisfaction of knowing that we are decidedly\r\nthe worst match in the kingdom--a match, too, that must be all your own\r\nwork, in which fate could have no hand, and which no foresight could\r\nforesee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A lady who affects poetry.--'I made regular approaches to her by\r\nsonnets and rebusses--a rondeau of circumvallation--her pride sapped by\r\nan elegy, and her reserve surprised by an impromptu--proceeding to storm\r\nwith Pindarics, she, at last, saved the further effusion of ink by a\r\ncapitulation.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Her prudish frowns and resentful looks are as ridiculous as 'twould be\r\nto see a board with notice of spring-guns set in a highway, or of Steel-\r\ntraps in a common--because they imply an insinuation that there is\r\nsomething worth plundering where one would not, in the least, suspect\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The expression of her face is at once a denial of all love-suit, and a\r\nconfession that she never was asked--the sourness of it arises not so\r\nmuch from her aversion to the passion, as from her never having had an\r\nopportunity to show it.--Her features are so unfortunately formed that\r\nshe could never dissemble or put on sweetness enough to induce any one\r\nto give her occasion to show her bitterness.--I never saw a woman to\r\nwhom you would more readily give credit for perfect chastity.\r\n\r\n\"_Lady Clio._ 'What am I reading?'--'have I drawn nothing lately?--\r\nis the work-bag finished?--how accomplished I am!--has the man been to\r\nuntune the harpsichord?--does it look as if I had been playing on it?\r\n\r\n\"'Shall I be ill to-day?--shall I be nervous?'--'Your La'ship was\r\nnervous yesterday.'--'Was I?--then I'll have a cold--I haven't had a\r\ncold this fortnight--a cold is becoming--no--I'll not have a cough;\r\nthat's fatiguing--I'll be quite well.'--'You become sickness--your\r\nLa'ship always looks vastly well when you're ill.'\r\n\r\n\"'Leave the book half read and the rose half finished--you know I love\r\nto be caught in the fact.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"One who knows that no credit is ever given to his assertions has the\r\nmore right to contradict his words.\r\n\r\n\"He goes the western circuit, to pick up small fees and impudence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A new wooden leg for Sir Charles Easy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"An ornament which proud peers wear all the year round--chimneysweepers\r\nonly on the first of May.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In marriage if you possess any thing very good, it makes you eager to\r\nget every thing else good of the same sort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The critic when he gets out of his carriage should always recollect,\r\nthat his footman behind is gone up to judge as well as himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"She might have escaped in her own clothes, but I suppose she thought it\r\nmore romantic to put on her brother's regimentals.\"\r\n\r\nThe rough sketches and fragments of poems, which Mr. Sheridan left\r\nbehind him, are numerous; but those among them that are sufficiently\r\nfinished to be cited, bear the marks of having been written when he was\r\nvery young, and would not much interest the reader--while of the rest it\r\nis difficult to find four consecutive lines, that have undergone enough\r\nof the _toilette_ of composition to be presentable in print. It was\r\nhis usual practice, when he undertook any subject in verse, to write\r\ndown his thoughts first in a sort of poetical prose,--with, here and\r\nthere, a rhyme or a metrical line, as they might occur--and then,\r\nafterwards to reduce with much labor, this anomalous compound to regular\r\npoetry. The birth of his prose being, as we have already seen, so\r\ndifficult, it may be imagined how painful was the travail of his verse.\r\nIndeed, the number of tasks which he left unfinished are all so many\r\nproofs of that despair of perfection, which those best qualified to\r\nattain it are always most likely to feel.\r\n\r\nThere are some fragments of an Epilogue apparently intended to be spoken\r\nin the character of a woman of fashion, which give a lively notion of\r\nwhat the poem would have been, when complete. The high carriages, that\r\nhad just then come into fashion, are thus adverted to:--\r\n\r\n  \"My carriage stared at!--none so high or fine--\r\n  Palmer's mail-coach shall be a sledge to mine.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  No longer now the youths beside us stand,\r\n  And talking lean, and leaning press the hand;\r\n  But ogling upward, as aloft we sit,\r\n  Straining, poor things, their ankles and their wit,\r\n  And, much too short the inside to explore,\r\n  Hang like supporters, half way up the door.\"\r\n\r\nThe approach of a \"veteran husband,\" to disturb these flirtations and\r\nchase away the lovers, is then hinted at:--\r\n\r\n  \"To persecuted virtue yield assistance,\r\n  And for one hour teach younger men their distance,\r\n  Make them, in very spite, appear discreet,\r\n  And mar the public mysteries of the street.\"\r\n\r\nThe affectation of appearing to make love, while talking on different\r\nmatters, is illustrated by the following simile:\r\n\r\n  \"So when dramatic statesmen talk apart,\r\n  With practis'd gesture and heroic start,\r\n  The plot's their theme, the gaping galleries guess,\r\n  While Hull and Fearon think of nothing less.\"\r\n\r\nThe following lines seem to belong to the same Epilogue:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Campus Martius of St. James's Street,\r\n  Where the beau's cavalry pace to and fro,\r\n  Before they take the field in Rotten Row;\r\n  Where Brooks' Blues and Weltze's Light Dragoons\r\n  Dismount in files and ogle in platoons.\"\r\n\r\nHe had also begun another Epilogue, directed against female gamesters,\r\nof which he himself repeated a couplet or two to Mr. Rogers a short time\r\nbefore his death, and of which there remain some few scattered traces\r\namong his papers:--\r\n\r\n  \"A night of fretful passion may consume\r\n  All that thou hast of beauty's gentle bloom,\r\n  And one distemper'd hour of sordid fear\r\n  Print on thy brow the wrinkles of a year.\r\n[Footnote: These four lines, as I have already remarked, are taken--with\r\nlittle change of the words, but a total alteration of the sentiment--from\r\nthe verses which he addressed to Mrs. Sheridan in the year 1773. See page\r\n83.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Great figure loses, little figure wins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ungrateful blushes and disorder'd sighs,\r\n  Which love disclaims nor even shame supplies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Gay smiles, which once belong'd to mirth alone,\r\n  And startling tears, which pity dares not own.\"\r\n\r\nThe following stray couplet would seem to have been intended for his\r\ndescription of Corilla:--\r\n\r\n  \"A crayon Cupid, redd'ning into shape,\r\n  Betrays her talents to design and scrape.\"\r\n\r\nThe Epilogue, which I am about to give, though apparently finished, has\r\nnot, as far as I can learn, yet appeared in print, nor am I at all aware\r\nfor what occasion it was intended.\r\n\r\n  \"In this gay month when, through the sultry hour,\r\n  The vernal sun denies the wonted shower,\r\n  When youthful Spring usurps maturer sway,\r\n  And pallid April steals the blush of May,\r\n  How joys the rustic tribe, to view displayed\r\n  The liberal blossom and the early shade!\r\n  But ah! far other air our soil delights;\r\n  _Here_ 'charming weather' is the worst of blights.\r\n  No genial beams rejoice our rustic train,\r\n  Their harvest's still the better for the rain.\r\n  To summer suns our groves no tribute owe,\r\n  They thrive in frost, and flourish best in snow.\r\n  When other woods resound the feather'd throng,\r\n  Our groves, our woods, are destitute of song.\r\n  The thrush, the lark, all leave our mimic vale,\r\n  No more we boast our Christmas nightingale;\r\n  Poor Rossignol--the wonder of his day,\r\n  Sung through the winter--but is mute in May.\r\n  Then bashful spring, that gilds fair nature's scene,\r\n  O'ercasts our lawns, and deadens every green;\r\n  Obscures our sky, embrowns the wooden shade,\r\n  And dries the channel of each tin cascade!\r\n    Oh hapless we, whom such ill fate betides,\r\n  Hurt by the beam which cheers the world besides!\r\n  Who love the ling'ring frost, nice, chilling showers,\r\n  While Nature's _Benefit_--is death to ours;\r\n  Who, witch-like, best in noxious mists perform,\r\n  Thrive in the tempest, and enjoy the storm.\r\n  O hapless we--unless your generous care\r\n  Bids us no more lament that Spring is fair,\r\n  But plenteous glean from the dramatic soil,\r\n  The vernal harvest of our winter's toil.\r\n  For April suns to us no pleasure bring--\r\n  Your presence here is all we feel of Spring;\r\n  May's riper beauties here no bloom display,\r\n  Your fostering smile alone proclaims it May.\"\r\n\r\nA poem upon Windsor Castle, half ludicrous and half solemn, appears,\r\nfrom the many experiments which he made upon it, to have cost him\r\nconsiderable trouble. The Castle, he says,\r\n\r\n  \"Its base a mountain, and itself a rock,\r\n    In proud defiance of the tempests' rage,\r\n  Like an old gray-hair'd veteran stands each shock--\r\n    The sturdy witness of a nobler age.\"\r\n\r\nHe then alludes to the \"cockney\" improvements that had lately taken\r\nplace, among which the venerable castle appears, like\r\n\r\n  \"A helmet on a Macaroni's head--\r\n  Or like old Talbot, turn'd into a fop,\r\n  With coat embroider'd and scratch wig at top.\"\r\n\r\nSome verses, of the same mixed character, on the short duration of life\r\nand the changes that death produces, thus begin:--\r\n\r\n  \"Of that same tree which gave the box,\r\n  Now rattling in the hand of FOX,\r\n  Perhaps his coffin shall be made.--\"\r\n\r\nHe then rambles into prose, as was his custom, on a sort of knight-\r\nerrantry after thoughts and images:--\"The lawn thou hast chosen for thy\r\nbridal shift--thy shroud may be of the same piece. That flower thou hast\r\nbought to feed thy vanity--from the same tree thy corpse may be decked.\r\nReynolds shall, like his colors, fly; and Brown, when mingled with the\r\ndust, manure the grounds he once laid out. Death is life's second\r\nchildhood; we return to the breast from whence we came, are weaned,....\"\r\n\r\nThere are a few detached lines and couplets of a poem, intended to\r\nridicule some fair invalid, who was much given to falling in love with\r\nher physicians:--\r\n\r\n  \"Who felt her pulse, obtained her heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe following couplet, in which he characterizes an amiable friend of\r\nhis, Dr. Bain, with whom he did not become acquainted till the year\r\n1792, proves these fragments to have been written after that period:--\r\n\r\n  \"Not savage ... nor gentle BAIN--\r\n  She was in love with Warwick Lane.\"\r\n\r\nAn \"Address to the Prince,\" on the exposed style of women's dress,\r\nconsists of little more than single lines, not yet wedded into couplets;\r\nsuch as--\"The more you show, the less we wish to see.\"--\"And bare their\r\nbodies, as they mask their minds,\" &c. This poem, however, must have\r\nbeen undertaken many years after his entrance into Parliament, as the\r\nfollowing curious political memorandum will prove:--\"I like it no better\r\nfor being from France--whence all ills come--altar of liberty, begrimed\r\nat once with blood and mire.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also some Anacreontics--lively, but boyish and extravagant.\r\nFor instance, in expressing his love of bumpers:--\r\n\r\n  \"Were mine a goblet that had room\r\n  For a whole vintage in its womb,\r\n  I still would have the liquor swim\r\n  An inch or two above the brim.\"\r\n\r\nThe following specimen is from one of those poems, whose length and\r\ncompleteness prove them to have been written at a time of life when he\r\nwas more easily pleased, and had not yet arrived at that state of glory\r\nand torment for the poet, when\r\n\r\n  \"_Toujours mecontent de ce qu'il vient de faire,\r\n  Il plait a tout le monde et ne scaurait se plaire:_\"--\r\n\r\n  \"The Muses call'd, the other morning,\r\n  On Phoebus, with a friendly warning\r\n  That invocations came so fast,\r\n  They must give up their trade at last,\r\n  And if he meant t' assist them all,\r\n  The aid of Nine would be too small.\r\n  Me then, as clerk, the Council chose,\r\n  To tell this truth in humble prose.--\r\n  But Phoebus, possibly intending\r\n  To show what all their hopes must end in,\r\n  To give the scribbling youths a sample,\r\n  And frighten them by my example,\r\n  Bade me ascend the poet's throne,\r\n  And give them verse--much like their own.\r\n\r\n  \"Who has not heard each poet sing\r\n  The powers of Heliconian spring?\r\n  Its noble virtues we are told\r\n  By all the rhyming crew of old.--\r\n  Drink but a little of its well,\r\n  And strait you could both write and spell,\r\n  While such rhyme-giving pow'rs run through it,\r\n  A quart would make an epic poet,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nA poem on the miseries of a literary drudge begins thus promisingly:--\r\n\r\n  \"Think ye how dear the sickly meal is bought,\r\n  By him who works at verse and trades in thought?\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is hardly legible; but there can be little doubt that he would\r\nhave done this subject justice;--for he had himself tasted of the\r\nbitterness with which the heart of a man of genius overflows, when forced\r\nby indigence to barter away (as it is here expressed) \"the reversion of\r\nhis thoughts,\" and\r\n\r\n  \"Forestall the blighted harvest of his brain.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be easily believed that, in looking over the remains, both\r\ndramatic and poetical, from which the foregoing specimens are taken, I\r\nhave been frequently tempted to indulge in much ampler extracts. It\r\nappeared to me, however, more prudent to rest satisfied with the\r\nselections here given; for, while less would have disappointed the\r\ncuriosity of the reader, more might have done injustice to the memory of\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHIS FIRST SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT.--ROCKINGHAM ADMINISTRATION.--\r\nCOALITION.--INDIA BILL.--RE-ELECTION FOR STAFFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period at which Mr. Sheridan entered upon his political career was,\r\nin every respect, remarkable. A persevering and vindictive war against\r\nAmerica, with the folly and guilt of which the obstinacy of the Court\r\nand the acquiescence of the people are equally chargeable, was fast\r\napproaching that crisis, which every unbiassed spectator of the contest\r\nhad long foreseen,--and at which, however humiliating to the haughty\r\npretensions of England, every friend to the liberties of the human race\r\nrejoiced. It was, perhaps, as difficult for this country to have been\r\nlong and virulently opposed to such principles as the Americans asserted\r\nin this contest, without being herself corrupted by the cause which she\r\nmaintained, as it was for the French to have fought, in the same\r\nconflict, by the side of the oppressed, without catching a portion of\r\nthat enthusiasm for liberty, which such an alliance was calculated to\r\ninspire. Accordingly, while the voice of philosophy was heard along the\r\nneighboring shores, speaking aloud those oracular warnings, which\r\npreceded the death of the Great Pan of Despotism, the courtiers and\r\nlawyers of England were, with an emulous spirit of servility, advising\r\nand sanctioning such strides of power, as would not have been unworthy\r\nof the most dark and slavish times.\r\n\r\nWhen we review, indeed, the history of the late reign, and consider how\r\ninvariably the arms and councils of Great Britain, in her Eastern wars,\r\nher conflict with America, and her efforts against revolutionary France,\r\nwere directed to the establishment and perpetuation of despotic\r\nprinciples, it seems little less than a miracle that her own liberty\r\nshould have escaped with life from the contagion. Never, indeed, can she\r\nbe sufficiently grateful to the few patriot spirits of this period, to\r\nwhose courage and eloquence she owes the high station of freedom yet\r\nleft to her;--never can her sons pay a homage too warm to the memory of\r\nsuch men as a Chatham, a Fox, and a Sheridan; who, however much they may\r\nhave sometimes sacrificed to false views of expediency, and, by\r\ncompromise with friends and coalition with foes, too often weakened\r\ntheir hold upon public confidence; however the attraction of the Court\r\nmay have sometimes made them librate in their orbit, were yet the saving\r\nlights of Liberty in those times, and alone preserved the ark of the\r\nConstitution from foundering in the foul and troubled waters that\r\nencompassed it.\r\n\r\nNot only were the public events, in which Mr. Sheridan was now called to\r\ntake a part, of a nature more extraordinary and awful than had often\r\nbeen exhibited on the theatre of politics, but the leading actors in the\r\nscene were of that loftier order of intellect, which Nature seems to\r\nkeep in reserve for the ennoblement of such great occasions. Two of\r\nthese, Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox, were already in the full maturity of their\r\nfame and talent,--while the third, Mr. Pitt, was just upon the point of\r\nentering, with the most auspicious promise, into the same splendid\r\ncareer:\r\n\r\n\"_Nunc cuspide Patris\r\n  Inclytus, Herculeas olim mature sagittas._\"\r\n\r\nThough the administration of that day, like many other ministries of the\r\nsame reign, was chosen more for the pliancy than the strength of its\r\nmaterials, yet Lord North himself was no ordinary man, and, in times of\r\nless difficulty and under less obstinate dictation, might have ranked as\r\na useful and most popular minister. It is true, as the defenders of his\r\nmeasures state, that some of the worst aggressions upon the rights of\r\nthe Colonies had been committed before he succeeded to power. But his\r\nreadiness to follow in these rash footsteps, and to deepen every fatal\r\nimpression which they had made;--his insulting reservation of the Tea\r\nDuty, by which he contrived to embitter the only measure of concession\r\nthat was wrung from him;--the obsequiousness, with which he made himself\r\nthe channel of the vindictive feelings of the Court, in that memorable\r\ndeclaration (rendered so truly mock-heroic by the event) that \"a total\r\nrepeal of the Port Duties could not be thought of, till America was\r\nprostrate at the feet of England;\"--all deeply involve him in the shame\r\nof that disastrous period, and identify his name with measures as\r\narbitrary and headstrong, as have ever disgraced the annals of the\r\nEnglish monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe playful wit and unvarying good-humor of this nobleman formed a\r\nstriking contrast to the harsh and precipitate policy, which it was his\r\nlot, during twelve stormy years, to enforce:--and, if his career was as\r\nheadlong as the torrent near its fall, it may also be said to have been\r\nas shining and as smooth. These attractive qualities secured to him a\r\nconsiderable share of personal popularity; and, had fortune ultimately\r\nsmiled on his councils, success would, as usual, have reconciled the\r\npeople of England to any means, however arbitrary, by which it had been\r\nattained. But the calamities, and, at last, the hopelessness of the\r\nconflict, inclined them to moralize upon its causes and character. The\r\nhour of Lord North's ascendant was now passing rapidly away, and Mr.\r\nSheridan could not have joined the Opposition, at a conjuncture more\r\nfavorable to the excitement of his powers, or more bright in the views\r\nwhich it opened upon his ambition.\r\n\r\nHe made his first speech in Parliament on the 20th of November, 1780,\r\nwhen a petition was presented to the House, complaining of the undue\r\nelection of the sitting members (himself and Mr. Monckton) for Stafford.\r\nIt was rather lucky for him that the occasion was one in which he felt\r\npersonally interested, as it took away much of that appearance of\r\nanxiety for display, which might have attended his first exhibition upon\r\nany general subject. The fame, however, which he had already acquired by\r\nhis literary talents, was sufficient, even on this question, to awaken\r\nall the curiosity and expectation of his audience; and accordingly we\r\nare told in the report of his speech, that \"he was heard with particular\r\nattention, the House being uncommonly still while he was speaking.\" The\r\nindignation, which he expressed on this occasion at the charges brought\r\nby the petition against the electors of Stafford, was coolly turned into\r\nridicule by Mr. Rigby, Paymaster of the Forces. But Mr. Fox, whose\r\neloquence was always ready at the call of good nature, and, like the\r\nshield of Ajax, had \"ample room and verge enough,\" to protect not only\r\nhimself but his friends, came promptly to the aid of the young orator;\r\nand, in reply to Mr. Rigby, observed, that \"though those ministerial\r\nmembers, who chiefly robbed and plundered their constituents, might\r\nafterwards affect to despise them, yet gentlemen, who felt properly the\r\nnature of the trust allotted to them, would always treat them and speak\r\nof them with respect.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on this night, as Woodfall used to relate, that Mr. Sheridan,\r\nafter he had spoken, came up to him in the gallery, and asked, with much\r\nanxiety, what he thought of his first attempt. The answer of Woodfall,\r\nas he had the courage afterwards to own, was, \"I am sorry to say I do\r\nnot think that this is your line--you had much better have stuck to your\r\nformer pursuits.\" On hearing which, Sheridan rested his head upon his\r\nhand for a few minutes, and then vehemently exclaimed, \"It is in me,\r\nhowever, and, by G--, it shall come out.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, indeed, that upon many persons besides Mr. Woodfall the\r\nimpression produced by this first essay of his oratory was far from\r\nanswerable to the expectations that had been formed. The chief defect\r\nremarked in him was a thick and indistinct mode of delivery, which,\r\nthough he afterwards greatly corrected it, was never entirely removed.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little amusing to find him in one of his early speeches,\r\ngravely rebuking Mr. Rigby and Mr. Courtenay [Footnote: Feb. 26.--On the\r\nsecond reading of the Bill for the better regulation of His Majesty's\r\nCivil List Revenue.] for the levity and raillery with which they treated\r\nthe subject before the House,--thus condemning the use of that weapon in\r\nother hands, which soon after became so formidable in his own. The\r\nremarks by which Mr. Courtenay (a gentleman, whose lively wit found\r\nafterwards a more congenial air on the benches of the Opposition)\r\nprovoked the reprimand of the new senator for Stafford, are too humorous\r\nto be passed over without, at least, a specimen of their spirit. In\r\nridiculing the conduct of the Opposition, he observed:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh liberty! Oh virtue! Oh my country! had been the pathetic, though\r\nfallacious cry of former Oppositions; but the present he was sure acted\r\non purer motives. They wept over their bleeding country, he had no\r\ndoubt. Yet the patriot 'eye in a fine frenzy rolling' sometimes deigned\r\nto cast a wishful squint on the riches and honors enjoyed by the\r\nminister and his venal supporters. If he were not apprehensive of\r\nhazarding a ludicrous allusion, (which he knew was always improper on a\r\nserious subject) he would compare their conduct to that of the\r\nsentimental alderman in one of Hogarth's prints, who, when his daughter\r\nis expiring, wears indeed a parental face of grief and solicitude, but\r\nit is to secure her diamond ring which he is drawing gently from her\r\nfinger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sheridan (says the report) rose and reprehended Mr. Courtenay for\r\nturning every thing that passed into ridicule; for having introduced\r\ninto the house a style of reasoning, in his opinion, every way\r\nunsuitable to the gravity and importance of the subjects that came under\r\ntheir discussion. If they would not act with dignity, he thought they\r\nmight, at least, debate with decency. He would not attempt to answer Mr.\r\nCourtenay's arguments, for it was impossible seriously to reply to what,\r\nin every part, had an infusion of ridicule in it. Two of the honorable\r\ngentlemen's similes, however, he must take notice of. The one was his\r\nhaving insinuated that the Opposition was envious of those who basked in\r\ncourt sunshine; and desirous merely to get into their places. He begged\r\nleave to remind the honorable gentleman that, though the sun afforded a\r\ngenial warmth, it also occasioned an intemperate heat, that tainted and\r\ninfected everything it reflected on. That this excessive heat tended to\r\ncorrupt as well as to cherish; to putrefy as well as to animate; to dry\r\nand soak up the wholesome juices of the body politic, and turn the whole\r\nof it into one mass of corruption. If those, therefore, who sat near him\r\ndid not enjoy so genial a warmth as the honorable gentleman, and those\r\nwho like him kept close to the noble Lord in the blue ribbon, he was\r\ncertain they breathed a purer air, an air less infected and less\r\ncorrupt.\"\r\n\r\nThis florid style, in which Mr. Sheridan was not very happy, he but\r\nrarely used in his speeches afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe first important subject that drew forth any thing like a display of\r\nhis oratory was a motion which he made on the 5th of March, 1781, \"For\r\nthe better regulation of the Police of Westminster.\" The chief object of\r\nthe motion was to expose the unconstitutional exercise of the\r\nprerogative that had been assumed, in employing the military to suppress\r\nthe late riots, without waiting for the authority of the civil power.\r\nThese disgraceful riots, which proved to what Christianity consequences\r\nthe cry of \"No Popery\" may lead, had the effect, which follows all\r\ntumultuary movements of the people, of arming the Government with new\r\npowers, and giving birth to doctrines and precedents permanently\r\ndangerous to liberty. It is a little remarkable that the policy of\r\nblending the army with the people and considering soldiers as citizens,\r\nwhich both Montesquieu and Blackstone recommend as favorable to freedom,\r\nshould, as applied by Lord Mansfield on this occasion, be pronounced,\r\nand perhaps with more justice, hostile to it; the tendency of such a\r\npractice being, it was said, to weaken that salutary jealousy, with\r\nwhich the citizens of a free state should ever regard a soldier, and\r\nthus familiarize the use of this dangerous machine, in every possible\r\nservice to which capricious power may apply it. The Opposition did not\r\ndeny that the measure of ordering out the military, and empowering their\r\nofficers to act at discretion without any reference to the civil\r\nmagistrate, was, however unconstitutional, not only justifiable but\r\nwise, in a moment of such danger. But the refusal of the minister to\r\nacknowledge the illegality of the proceeding by applying to the House\r\nfor an Act of Indemnity, and the transmission of the same discretionary\r\norders to the soldiery throughout the country, where no such imminent\r\nnecessity called for it, were the points upon which the conduct of the\r\nGovernment was strongly, and not unjustly, censured.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the manifest design of the Ministry, at this crisis, to avail\r\nthemselves of the impression produced by the riots, as a means of\r\nextending the frontier of their power, and fortifying the doctrines by\r\nwhich they defended it, spread an alarm among the friends of\r\nconstitutional principles, which the language of some of the advocates\r\nof the Court was by no means calculated to allay. Among others, a Noble\r\nEarl,--one of those awkward worshippers of power, who bring ridicule\r\nalike upon their idol and themselves,--had the foolish effrontery, in\r\nthe House of Lords, to eulogize the moderation which His Majesty had\r\ndisplayed, in not following the recent example of the king of Sweden,\r\nand employing the sword, with which the hour of difficulty had armed\r\nhim, for the subversion of the Constitution and the establishment of\r\ndespotic power. Though this was the mere ebullition of an absurd\r\nindividual, yet the bubble on the surface often proves the strength of\r\nthe spirit underneath, and the public were justified by a combination of\r\ncircumstances, in attributing designs of the most arbitrary nature to\r\nsuch a Court and such an Administration. Meetings were accordingly held\r\nin some of the principal counties, and resolutions passed, condemning\r\nthe late unconstitutional employment of the military. Mr. Fox had\r\nadverted to it strongly at the opening of the Session, and it is a proof\r\nof the estimation in which Mr. Sheridan already stood with his party,\r\nthat he was the person selected to bring forward a motion, upon a\r\nsubject in which the feelings of the public were so much interested. In\r\nthe course of his speech he said:--\r\n\r\n\"If this doctrine was to be laid down, that the Crown could give orders\r\nto the military to interfere, when, where, and for what length of time\r\nit pleases, then we might bid farewell to freedom. If this was the law,\r\nwe should then be reduced to a military government of the very worst\r\nspecies, in which we should have all the evils of a despotic state,\r\nwithout the discipline or the security. But we were given to understand,\r\nthat we had the best protection against this evil, in the virtue, the\r\nmoderation, and the constitutional principles of the sovereign. No man\r\nupon earth thought with more reverence than himself of the virtues and\r\nmoderation of the sovereign; but this was a species of liberty which he\r\ntrusted would never disgrace an English soil. The liberty that rested on\r\nthe virtuous inclinations of any one man, was but suspended despotism;\r\nthe sword was not indeed upon their necks, but it hung by the small and\r\nbrittle thread of human will.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passage of this speech affords an example of that sort of\r\nantithesis of epithet, which, as has been already remarked, was one of\r\nthe most favorite contrivances of his style:--\r\n\r\n\"Was not the conduct of that man or men criminal, who had permitted\r\nthose Justices to continue in the commission? Men of _tried\r\ninability_ and _convicted deficiency_! Had no attempt been made\r\nto establish some more effectual system of police, in order that we\r\nmight still depend upon the remedy of the bayonet, and that the military\r\npower might be called in to the aid of _contrived weakness_ and\r\n_deliberate inattention_?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the few instances in which he ever differed with his friend, Mr.\r\nFox, occurred during this session, upon the subject of a Bill which the\r\nlatter introduced for the Repeal of the Marriage Act, and which he\r\nprefaced by a speech as characteristic of the ardor, the simplicity, the\r\nbenevolence and fearlessness of his disposition, as any ever pronounced\r\nby him in public. Some parts, indeed, of this remarkable speech are in a\r\nstrain of feeling so youthful and romantic, that they seem more fit to\r\nbe addressed to one of those Parliaments of Love, which were held during\r\nthe times of Chivalry, than to a grave assembly employed about the sober\r\nrealities of life, and legislating with a view to the infirmities of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of Mr. Fox to the Marriage Act was hereditary, as it had\r\nbeen opposed with equal vehemence by his father, on its first\r\nintroduction in 1753, when a debate not less memorable took place, and\r\nwhen Sir Dudley Ryder, the Attorney-general of the day, did not hesitate\r\nto advance, as one of his arguments in favor of the Bill, that it would\r\ntend to keep the aristocracy of the country pure, and prevent their\r\nmixture by intermarriage with the mass of the people. However this\r\nanxiety for the \"streams select\" of noble blood, or views, equally\r\nquestionable, for the accumulation of property in great families, may\r\nhave influenced many of those with whom the Bill originated,--however\r\ncruel, too, and mischievous, some of its enactments may be deemed, yet\r\nthe general effect which the measure was intended to produce, of\r\ndiminishing as much as possible the number of imprudent marriages, by\r\nallowing the pilotage of parental authority to continue till the first\r\nquicksands of youth are passed, is, by the majority of the civilized\r\nworld, acknowledged to be desirable and beneficial. Mr. Fox, however,\r\nthought otherwise, and though--\"bowing,\" as he said, \"to the prejudices\r\nof mankind,\"--he consented to fix the age at which young people should\r\nbe marriageable without the consent of parents, at sixteen years for the\r\nwoman and eighteen for the man, his own opinion was decidedly for\r\nremoving all restriction whatever, and for leaving the \"heart of youth\"\r\nwhich, in these cases, was \"wiser than the head of age,\" without limit\r\nor control, to the choice which its own desires dictated.\r\n\r\nHe was opposed in his arguments, not only by Mr. Sheridan, but by Mr.\r\nBurke, whose speech on this occasion was found among his manuscripts\r\nafter his death, and is enriched, though short, by some of those golden\r\nsentences, which he \"scattered from his urn\" upon every subject that\r\ncame before him. [Footnote: In alluding to Mr. Fox's too favorable\r\nestimate of the capability of very young persons to choose for\r\nthemselves, he pays the following tribute to his powers:--\"He is led\r\ninto it by a natural and to him inevitable and real mistake, that the\r\nordinary race of mankind advance as fast towards maturity of judgment\r\nand understanding as he has done.\" His concluding words are:--\"Have\r\nmercy on the youth of both sexes; protect them from their ignorance and\r\ninexperience; protect one part of life by the wisdom of another; protect\r\nthem by the wisdom of laws and the care of nature.\"] Mr. Sheridan, for\r\nwhose opinions upon this subject the well-known history of his own\r\nmarriage must have secured no ordinary degree of attention, remarked\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n\"His honorable friend, who brought in the bill, appeared not to be aware\r\nthat, if he carried the clause enabling girls to marry at sixteen, he\r\nwould do an injury to that liberty of which he had always shown himself\r\nthe friend, and promote domestic tyranny, which he could consider only\r\nas little less intolerable than public tyranny. If girls were allowed to\r\nmarry at sixteen, they would, he conceived, be abridged of that happy\r\nfreedom of intercourse, which modern custom had introduced between the\r\nyouth of both sexes; and which was, in his opinion, the best nursery of\r\nhappy marriages. Guardians would, in that case, look on their wards with\r\na jealous eye, from a fear that footmen and those about them might take\r\nadvantage of their tender years and immature judgment, and persuade them\r\ninto marriage, as soon as they attained the age of sixteen.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat extraordinary that, during the very busy interval\r\nwhich passed between Mr. Sheridan's first appearance in Parliament and\r\nhis appointment under Lord Rockingham's administration in 1782, he\r\nshould so rarely have taken a part in the debates that occurred--\r\ninteresting as they were, not only from the importance of the topics\r\ndiscussed, but from the more than usual animation now infused into the\r\nwarfare of parties, by the last desperate struggles of the Ministry and\r\nthe anticipated triumph of the Opposition. Among the subjects, upon\r\nwhich he appears to have been rather unaccountably silent, was the\r\nrenewal of Mr. Burke's Bill for the Regulation of the Civil List,--an\r\noccasion memorable as having brought forth the maiden speech of Mr.\r\nPitt, and witnessed the first accents of that eloquence which was\r\ndestined, ere long, to sound, like the shell of Misenus, through Europe,\r\nand call kings and nations to battle by its note. The debate upon the\r\nlegality of petitions from delegated bodies, in which Mr. Dunning\r\nsustained his high and rare character of a patriot lawyer;--the bold\r\nproposal of Mr. Thomas Pitt, that the Commons should withhold the\r\nsupplies, till pledges of amendment in the administration of public\r\naffairs should be given;--the Bill for the exclusion of Excise Officers\r\nand Contractors from Parliament, which it was reserved for a Whig\r\nAdministration to pass;--these and other great constitutional questions,\r\nthrough which Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox fought, side by side, lavishing at\r\nevery step the inexhaustible ammunition of their intellect, seem to have\r\npassed away without once calling into action the powers of their new and\r\nbrilliant auxiliary, Sheridan.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Ireland, too, had assumed at this period, under the\r\nauspices of Mr. Grattan and the example of America, a character of\r\ngrandeur, as passing as it was bright,--but which will long be\r\nremembered with melancholy pride by her sons, and as long recall the\r\nmemory of that admirable man, to whose patriotism she owed her brief day\r\nof freedom, and upon whose name that momentary sunshine of her sad\r\nhistory rests. An opportunity of adverting to the events, which had\r\nlately taken place in Ireland, was afforded by Mr. Fox in a motion for\r\nthe re-commitment of the Mutiny Bill; and on this subject, perhaps, the\r\nsilence of Mr. Sheridan may be accounted for, from his reluctance to\r\nshare the unpopularity attached by his countrymen to those high notions\r\nof the supremacy of England, which, on the great question of the\r\nindependence of the Irish Parliament, both Mr. Fox and Mr. Burke were\r\nknown to entertain. [Footnote: As the few beautiful sentences spoken by\r\nBurke on this occasion, in support of his friend's motion, have been\r\nsomewhat strangely omitted in the professed collection of all his\r\nspeeches, I shall give them here as they are reported in the\r\nParliamentary History:--\"Mr. Burke said, so many and such great\r\nrevolutions had happened of late, that he was not much surprised to hear\r\nthe Right Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Jenkinson) treat the loss of the supremacy\r\nof this country over Ireland as a matter of very little consequence.\r\nThus, one star, and that the brightest ornament of our orrery, having\r\nbeen suffered to be lost, those who were accustomed to inspect and watch\r\nour political heaven ought not to wonder that it should be followed by\r\nthe loss of another.--\r\n\r\n  So star would follow star, and light light,\r\n  Till all was darkness and eternal night.\"]\r\n\r\nEven on the subject of the American war, which was now the important\r\npoint that called forth all the resources of attack and defence on both\r\nsides, the co-operation of Mr. Sheridan appears to have been but rare\r\nand casual. The only occasions, indeed, connected with this topic upon\r\nwhich I can trace him as having spoken at any length, were the charges\r\nbrought forward by Mr. Fox against the Admiralty for their mismanagement\r\nof the naval affairs of 1781, and the Resolution of censure on His\r\nMajesty's Ministers moved by Lord John Cavendish. His remarks in the\r\nlatter debate upon the two different sets of opinions, by which (as by\r\nthe double soul, imagined in Xenophon) the speaking and the voting of\r\nMr. Rigby were actuated, are very happy:--\r\n\r\n\"The Right Hon. Gentleman, however, had acted in this day's debate with\r\nperfect consistency. He had assured the House that he thought the Noble\r\nLord ought to resign his office; and yet he would give his vote for his\r\nremaining in it. In the same manner he had long declared, that he\r\nthought the American war ought to be abandoned; yet had uniformly given\r\nhis vote for its continuance. He did not mean, however, to insinuate any\r\nmotives for such conduct;--he believed the Right Hon. Gentleman to have\r\nbeen sincere; he believed that, as a member of Parliament, as a Privy\r\nCouncillor, as a private gentleman, he had always detested the American\r\nwar as much as any man; but that he had never been able to persuade the\r\nPaymaster that it was a bad war; and unfortunately, in whatever\r\ncharacter he spoke, it was the Paymaster who always voted in that\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\nThe infrequency of Mr. Sheridan's exertions upon the American question\r\ncombines with other circumstances to throw some doubts upon an anecdote,\r\nwhich has been, however, communicated to me as coming from an authority\r\nworthy in every respect of the most implicit belief. He is said to have\r\nreceived, towards the close of this war, a letter from one of the\r\nleading persons of the American Government, expressing high admiration\r\nof his talents and political principles, and informing him that the sum\r\nof twenty thousand pounds had been deposited for him in the hands of a\r\ncertain banker, as a mark of the value which the American people\r\nattached to his services in the cause of liberty. To this Mr. S.\r\nreturned an answer (which, as well as the letter, was seen, it is said,\r\nby the person with whom the anecdote originated) full of the most\r\nrespectful gratitude for the opinion entertained of his services, but\r\nbegging leave to decline a gift under such circumstances. That this\r\nwould have been the nature of his answer, had any such proposal\r\noccurred, the generally high tone of his political conduct forbids us to\r\nfeel any doubt,--but, with respect to the credibility of the transaction\r\naltogether, it is far less easy to believe that the Americans had so\r\nmuch money to give, than that Mr. Sheridan should have been sufficiently\r\nhigh-minded to refuse it.\r\n\r\nNot only were the occasions very few and select, on which he offered\r\nhimself to the attention of the House at this period, but, whenever he\r\ndid speak, it was concisely and unpretendingly, with the manner of a\r\nperson who came to learn a new road to fame,--not of one who laid claim\r\nto notice upon the credit of the glory he brought with him. Mr. Fox used\r\nto say that he considered his conduct in this respect as a most striking\r\nproof of his sagacity and good taste;--such rare and unassuming displays\r\nof his talents being the only effectual mode he could have adopted, to\r\nwin on the attention of his audience, and gradually establish himself in\r\ntheir favor. He had, indeed, many difficulties and disadvantages to\r\nencounter, of which his own previous reputation was not the least. Not\r\nonly did he risk a perilous comparison between his powers, as a speaker\r\nand his fame as a writer, but he had also to contend with that feeling\r\nof monopoly, which pervades the more worldly classes of talent, and\r\nwhich would lead politicians to regard as an intruder upon their craft,\r\na man of genius thus aspiring to a station among them, without the usual\r\nqualifications of either birth or apprenticeship to entitle him to it.\r\n[Footnote: There is an anecdote strongly illustrative of this\r\nobservation, quoted by Lord John Russell in his able and lively work\r\n\"On the Affairs of Europe from the Peace of Utrecht.\"--Mr. Steele (in\r\nalluding to Sir Thomas Hanmer's opposition to the Commercial Treaty in\r\n1714) said, \"I rise to do him honor\"--on which many members who had\r\nbefore tried to interrupt him, called out, 'Taller, Taller;' and as he\r\nwent down the House, several said, 'It is not so easy a thing to speak\r\nin the House:' 'He fancies because he can scribble,' &c. &c.,--Slight\r\ncircumstances, indeed, (adds Lord John,) but which show at once the\r\nindisposition of the House to the Whig party, and the natural envy of\r\nmankind, long ago remarked by Cicero, towards all who attempt to gain\r\nmore than one kind of pre-eminence.] In an assembly, too, whose\r\ndeference for rank and property is such as to render it lucky that these\r\ninstruments of influence are so often united with honesty and talent,\r\nthe son of an actor and proprietor of a theatre had, it must be owned,\r\nmost fearful odds against him, in entering into competition with the\r\nsons of Lord Holland and Lord Chatham.\r\n\r\nWith the same discretion that led him to obtrude himself but seldom on\r\nthe House, he never spoke at this period but after careful and even\r\nverbal preparation. Like most of our great orators at the commencement\r\nof their careers, he was in the habit of writing out his speeches before\r\nhe delivered them; and, though subsequently he scribbled these\r\npreparatory sketches upon detached sheets, I find that he began by using\r\nfor this purpose the same sort of copy books, which he had employed in\r\nthe first rough draughts of his plays.\r\n\r\nHowever ill the affairs of the country were managed by Lord North, in\r\nthe management of Parliament few ministers have been more smoothly\r\ndexterous; and through the whole course of those infatuated measures,\r\nwhich are now delivered over, without appeal, to the condemnation of\r\nHistory, he was cheered along by as full and triumphant majorities, as\r\never followed in the wake of ministerial power. At length, however, the\r\nspirit of the people, that last and only resource against the venality\r\nof parliaments and the obstinacy of kings, was roused from its long and\r\ndangerous sleep by the unparalleled exertions of the Opposition leaders,\r\nand spoke out with a voice, always awfully intelligible, against the men\r\nand the measures that had brought England to the brink of ruin. The\r\neffect of this popular feeling soon showed itself in the upper regions.\r\nThe country-gentlemen, those birds of political omen, whose migrations\r\nare so portentous of a change of weather, began to flock in numbers to\r\nthe brightening quarter of Opposition; and at last, Lord North, after\r\none or two signal defeats (in spite even of which the Court for some\r\ntime clung to him, as the only hope of its baffled, but persevering\r\nrevenge), resigned the seals of office in the month of March, 1782, and\r\nan entirely new administration was formed under the promising auspices\r\nof the Marquis of Rockingham.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan, as might be expected, shared in the triumph of his party,\r\nby being appointed one of the Under Secretaries of State; and, no doubt,\r\nlooked forward to a long and improving tenure of that footing in office\r\nwhich his talents had thus early procured for him. But, however\r\nprosperous on the surface the complexion of the ministry might be, its\r\nintestine state was such as did not promise a very long existence.\r\nWhiggism is a sort of political Protestantism, and pays a similar tax\r\nfor the freedom of its creed, in the multiplicity of opinions which that\r\nvery freedom engenders--while true Toryism, like Popery, holding her\r\nchildren together by the one common doctrine of the infallibility of the\r\nThrone, takes care to repress any schism inconvenient to their general\r\ninterest, and keeps them, at least for all intents and purposes of\r\nplace-holding, unanimous.\r\n\r\nBetween the two branches of Opposition that composed the present\r\nadministration there were some very important, if not essential,\r\ndifferences of opinion. Lord Shelburne, the pupil and friend of Lord\r\nChatham, held the same high but unwise opinions, with respect to the\r\nrecognition of American independence, which \"the swan-like end\" of that\r\ngreat man has consecrated in our imagination, however much our reason\r\nmay condemn them. \"Whenever\" said Lord Shelburne, \"the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain shall acknowledge the independence of America, from that\r\nmoment the sun of England is set for ever.\" With regard to the affairs\r\nof India, too, and the punishment of those who were accused of\r\nmismanaging them, the views of the noble Lord wholly differed from those\r\nof Mr. Fox and his followers--as appeared from the decided part in favor\r\nof Mr. Hastings, which he took in the subsequent measure of the\r\nImpeachment. In addition to these fertile seeds of disunion, the\r\nretention in the cabinet of a person like Lord Thurlow, whose views of\r\nthe Constitution were all through the wrong end of the telescope, and\r\nwho did not even affect to conceal his hostility to the principles of\r\nhis colleagues, seemed such a provision, at starting, for the\r\nembarrassment of the Ministry, as gave but very little hope of its union\r\nor stability.\r\n\r\nThe only Speech, of which any record remains as having been delivered by\r\nMr. Sheridan during his short official career, was upon a motion made by\r\nMr. Eden, the late Secretary for Ireland, \"to repeal so much of the act\r\nof George I. as asserted a right in the King and Parliament of Great\r\nBritain to make laws to bind the Kingdom of Ireland.\" This motion was\r\nintended to perplex the new ministers, who, it was evident from the\r\nspeech of Mr. Fox on the subject, had not yet made up their minds to\r\nthat surrender of the Legislative Supremacy of Great Britain, which\r\nIreland now, with arms in her hands, demanded. [Footnote: Mr. Fox, in\r\nhis speech upon the Commercial Propositions of 1785, acknowledged the\r\nreluctance that was felt at this period, in surrendering the power of\r\nexternal or commercial legislation over Ireland:--\"a power,\" he said,\r\n\"which, in their struggles for independence, the Irish had imprudently\r\ninsisted on having abolished, and which he had himself given up in\r\ncompliance with the strong prejudices of that nation, though with a\r\nreluctance that nothing but irresistible necessity could overcome.\"] Mr.\r\nSheridan concurred with the Honorable Secretary in deprecating such a\r\nhasty and insidious agitation of the question, but at the same time\r\nexpressed in a much more unhesitating manner, his opinion of that Law of\r\nSubjection from which Ireland now rose to release herself:--\r\n\r\n\"If he declared himself (he said) so decided an enemy to the principle\r\nof the Declaratory Law in question, which he had always regarded as a\r\ntyrannous usurpation in this country, he yet could not but reprobate the\r\nmotives which influenced the present mover for its repeal--but, if the\r\nhouse divided on it, he should vote with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe general sense of the House being against the motion, it was\r\nwithdrawn. But the spirit of the Irish nation had advanced too far on\r\nits march to be called back even by the most friendly voice. All that\r\nnow remained for the ministers was to yield, with a confiding frankness,\r\nwhat the rash measures of their predecessors and the weakness of England\r\nhad put it out of their power with safety to refuse. This policy, so\r\ncongenial to the disposition of Mr. Fox, was adopted. His momentary\r\nhesitation was succeeded by such a prompt and generous acquiescence in\r\nthe full demands of the Irish Parliament, as gave all the grace of a\r\nfavor to what necessity would, at all events, have extorted--and, in\r\nthe spirited assertion of the rights of freemen on one side, and the\r\ncordial and entire recognition of them on the other, the names of\r\nGrattan and Fox, in that memorable moment, reflected a lustre on each\r\nother which associates them in its glory for ever.\r\n\r\nAnother occasion upon which Mr. Sheridan spoke while in office,--though\r\nno report of his Speech has been preserved--was a motion for a Committee\r\nto examine into the State of the Representation, brought forward by the\r\nyouthful reformer, Mr. William Pitt, whose zeal in the cause of freedom\r\nwas at that time, perhaps, sincere, and who little dreamed of the war he\r\nwas destined to wage with it afterwards. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan spoke\r\nstrongly in favor of the motion, while, in compliance with the request\r\nof the former, Mr. Burke absented himself from the discussion--giving\r\nthe cause of Reform, for once, a respite from the thunders of his\r\neloquence, like the sleep of Jove, in Homer, which leaves the Greeks for\r\nthe moment masters of the field.\r\n\r\n  [Greek]_Sphin chndos opaze, minuntha per, ophr'eati endei\r\n  Zeus.\r\n[Footnote: \"And, while the moment lasts of Jove's repose, Make victory\r\ntheirs.\" COWPER.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, the question was lost by a majority\r\nof 161 to 141.\r\n\r\nImmediately on his accession to office, Mr. Sheridan received the\r\nfollowing letter from his brother Charles Francis, who had been called\r\nto the Irish bar in 1778 or 9, but was at this time practising as a\r\nSpecial Pleader:--\r\n\r\n\"Dublin, March 27, 1782.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR DICK,\r\n\r\n\"I am much obliged to you for your early intelligence concerning the\r\nfate of the Ministry, and give you joy on the occasion, notwithstanding\r\nyour sorrow for the departure of the good Opposition. I understand very\r\nwell what you mean by this sorrow--but as you may be now in a situation\r\nin which you may obtain some substantial advantage for yourself, for\r\nGod's sake improve the opportunity to the utmost, and don't let dreams\r\nof empty fame (of which you have had enough in conscience) carry you\r\naway from your solid interests.\r\n\r\n\"I return you many thanks for Fox's letter. I mean for your intention to\r\nmake him write one--for as your good intentions always satisfy your\r\nconscience, and that you seem to think the carrying them into execution\r\nto be a mere trifling ceremony, as well omitted as not, your friends\r\nmust always take the _will_ for the _deed_. I will forgive\r\nyou, however, on condition that you will for once in your life consider\r\nthat though the _will_ alone may perfectly satisfy yourself, your\r\nfriends would be a little more, gratified if they were sometimes to see\r\nit accompanied by the deed--and let me be the first upon whom you try\r\nthe experiment If the people here are not to share the fate of their\r\npatrons, but are suffered to continue in the government of this country,\r\nI believe you will have it in your power, as I am certain it will be in\r\nyour inclination, to fortify my claims upon them by recommendations from\r\nyour side of the water, in such a manner as to insure to me what I have\r\na right to expect from them, but of which I can have no certainty\r\nwithout that assistance. I wish the present people may continue here,\r\nbecause I certainly have claims upon them, and considering the footing\r\nthat Lord C--- and Charles Fox are on, a recommendation from the latter\r\nwould now have every weight,--it would be drawing a bill upon Government\r\nhere, payable at sight, which they dare not protest. So, dear Dick, I\r\nshall rely upon you that will _really_ be done: and, to confess the\r\ntruth, unless it be done, and that speedily, I shall be completely\r\nruined, for this damned annuity, payable to my uncle, plays the devil\r\nwith me. If there is any intention of recalling the people here, I beg\r\nyou will let me know it as soon as possible, that I may take my measures\r\naccordingly,--and I think I may rely upon you also that whoever comes\r\nover here as Lord L----t, I shall not be forgot among the number of\r\nthose who shall be recommended to them.\r\n\r\n\"As to our politics here, I send you a newspaper,--read the resolutions\r\nof the volunteers, and you will be enabled to form some idea of the\r\nspirit which at present pervades this country. A declaration of the\r\nindependency of our Parliament upon yours will _certainly_ pass our\r\nHouse of Commons immediately after the recess; government here dare not,\r\ncannot oppose it; you will see the volunteers have pledged their lives\r\nand fortunes in support of the measure. The grand juries of every county\r\nhave followed their example, and some of the staunchest friends of\r\ngovernment have been, much against their inclinations, compelled to sign\r\nthe most spirited Resolutions.\r\n\r\n\"A call of the House is ordered for the first Tuesday after the recess,\r\nand circular letters from the Speaker worded in this remarkable manner,\r\n\"that the members do attend on that day as _they tender the rights of\r\nIreland_.\" In short, nothing will satisfy the people but the most\r\nunequivocal assertion of the total independence of the Irish\r\nlegislature. This flame has been raised within this six weeks, and is\r\nentirely owing either to the insidious design or unpardonable\r\ninattention of the late administration, in including, or suffering to be\r\nincluded, the name of Ireland in no less than five British statutes\r\npassed last sessions. People here were ignorant of this till Grattan\r\nproduced the five Acts to the House of Commons, one of which Eden had\r\nbeen so imprudent as to publish in the Dublin gazette. Previous to this\r\nthe general sense of the country was, that the mere question of right\r\nshould be suffered to sleep, provided the _exercise_ of the power\r\nclaimed under it should never again be resorted to in a single instance.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner you repeal the 6th of G. I. the better; for, believe me,\r\nnothing short of that can now preserve union and cordiality between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\n\"I hope my father and you are very good friends by this. I shall not be\r\nable to send you the remaining 50_l_. till October, as I have been\r\ndisappointed as to the time of payment of the money I expected to\r\nreceive this month. Let me entreat you to write to me shortly a few\r\nwords. I beg my love to Mrs. S. and Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Dick,\r\n\r\n\"Your very affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n\"C. F. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nThe expectations of the writer of this letter were not disappointed. The\r\ninfluence of Mr. Sheridan, added to his own claims, procured for him the\r\noffice of Secretary of War in Ireland,--a situation, which the greater\r\npliancy of his political principles contrived to render a more permanent\r\nbenefit to him than any that his Whig brother was ever able to secure\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Marquis of Rockingham broke up this shortlived\r\nMinistry, which, during the four months of its existence, did more\r\nperhaps for the principles of the Constitution, than any one\r\nadministration that England had seen since the Revolution. They were\r\nbetrayed, it is true, into a few awkward overflowings of loyalty, which\r\nthe rare access of Whigs to the throne may at once account for and\r\nexcuse:--and Burke, in particular, has left us a specimen of his taste\r\nfor extremes, in that burst of optimism with which he described the\r\nKing's message, as \"the best of messages to the best of people from the\r\nbest of kings.\" But these first effects of the atmosphere of a court,\r\nupon heads unaccustomed to it, are natural and harmless--while the\r\nmeasures that passed during that brief interval, directed against the\r\nsources of Parliamentary corruption, and confirmatory of the best\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, must ever be remembered to the honor of\r\nthe party from which they emanated. The exclusion of contractors from\r\nthe House of Commons--the disqualification of revenue-officers from\r\nvoting at elections--the disfranchisement of corrupt voters at\r\nCricklade, by which a second precedent [Footnote: The first was that of\r\nthe borough of Shoreham in 1771.] was furnished towards that plan of\r\ngradual Reform, which has, in our own time, been so forcibly recommended\r\nby Lord John Russell--the diminution of the patronage of the Crown, by\r\nMr. Burke's celebrated Bill [Footnote: This Bill, though its circle of\r\nretrenchment was, as might be expected, considerably narrowed, when the\r\nTreasury Bench became the centre from which he described it, was yet\r\neminently useful, as an acknowledgment from ministerial authority of the\r\nnecessity of such occasional curtailments of the Royal influence.]--the\r\nreturn to the old constitutional practice [Footnote: First departed from\r\nin 1769. See Burke's powerful exposure of the mischiefs of this\r\ninnovation, in his \"Thoughts on the Causes of the present Discontents.\"]\r\nof making the revenues of the Crown pay off their own incumbrances,\r\nwhich salutary principle was again lost in the hands of Mr. Pitt--the\r\natonement at last made to the violated rights of electors, by the\r\nrescinding of the Resolutions relative to Wilkes--the frank and cordial\r\nunderstanding entered into with Ireland, which identifies the memory of\r\nMr. Fox and this ministry with the only _oasis_ in the whole desert\r\nof Irish history--so many and such important recognitions of the best\r\nprinciples of Whiggism, followed up, as they were, by the Resolutions of\r\nLord John Cavendish at the close of the Session, pledging the ministers\r\nto a perseverance in the same task of purification and retrenchment,\r\ngive an aspect to this short period of the annals of the late reign, to\r\nwhich the eye turns for relief from the arbitrary complexion of the\r\nrest; and furnish us with, at least, _one_ consoling instance,\r\nwhere the principles professed by statesmen, when in opposition, were\r\nretained and sincerely acted upon by them in power.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Marquis of Rockingham, Lord Shelburne, without, as\r\nit appears, consulting any of the persons attached to that nobleman,\r\naccepted the office of first Lord of the Treasury; in consequence of\r\nwhich Mr. Fox, and the greater number of his friends--among whom were\r\nMr. Burke and Mr. Sheridan--sent in their resignations; while General\r\nConway, the Duke of Richmond, and one or two other old allies of the\r\nparty, remained in office.\r\n\r\nTo a disposition so social as that of Mr. Fox, the frequent interruption\r\nand even loss of friendships, which he had to sustain in the course of\r\nhis political career, must have been a sad alloy to its pleasure and its\r\npride. The fable of the sheep that leaves its fleece on the bramble bush\r\nis but too apt an illustration of the fate of him, who thus sees himself\r\nstripped of the comforts of friendship by the tenacious and thorny hold\r\nof politics. On the present occasion, however, the desertion of his\r\nstandard by a few who had followed him cordially in his ascent to power,\r\nbut did not show the same alacrity in accompanying his voluntary fall,\r\nwas amply made up to him by the ready devotion, with which the rest of\r\nthe party shared his fortunes. The disinterestedness of Sheridan was the\r\nmore meritorious, if, as there is every reason to believe, he considered\r\nthe step of resignation at such a moment to be, at least, hasty, if not\r\nwholly wrong. In this light it was, indeed, viewed by many judicious\r\npersons at the time, and the assurances given by the Duke of Richmond\r\nand General Conway, of the continued adherence of the cabinet to the\r\nsame principles and measures, to which they were pledged at the first\r\nformation of the ministry, would seem to confirm the justice of the\r\nopinion. So much temper, however, had, during the few months of their\r\nunion, been fermenting between the two great masses of which the\r\nadministration was composed, that it would have been difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, for the Rockingham party to rally, with any cordiality,\r\nround Lord Shelburne, as a leader--however they might still have been\r\ncontented to co-operate with him, had he remained in the humble station\r\nwhich he himself had originally selected. That noble Lord, too, who felt\r\nthat the sacrifice which he had considerately made, in giving up the\r\nsupremacy of station to Lord Rockingham, had, so far from being duly\r\nappreciated by his colleagues, been repaid only with increased\r\nalienation and distrust, could hardly be expected to make a second\r\nsurrender of his advantages, in favor of persons who had, he thought, so\r\nungraciously requited him for the first. In the mean time the Court, to\r\nwhich the Rockingham party was odious, had, with its usual policy,\r\nhollowed the ground beneath them, so as to render their footing neither\r\nagreeable nor safe. The favorite object in that quarter being to compose\r\na ministry of those convenient ingredients, called \"King's friends,\"\r\nLord Shelburne was but made use of as a temporary instrument, to clear\r\naway, in the first plane, the chief obstacles to such an arrangement,\r\nand then, in his turn, be sacrificed himself, as soon as a more\r\nsubservient system could be organized. It was, indeed, only upon a\r\nstrong representation from his Lordship of the impossibility of carrying\r\non his government against such an Opposition, without the infusion of\r\nfresh and popular talent, that the royal consent was obtained to the\r\nappointment of Mr. Pitt--the memory of whose uncompromising father, as\r\nwell as the first achievements on his own youthful shield, rendered him\r\nno very promising accession to such a scheme of government, as was\r\nevidently then contemplated by the Court.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs, the resignation of Mr. Fox and his friends was\r\nbut a prompt and spirited anticipation of what must inevitably have\r\ntaken place, under circumstances much less redounding to the credit of\r\ntheir independence and disinterestedness. There is little doubt, indeed,\r\nthat with the great majority of the nation, Mr. Fox by this step\r\nconsiderably added to his popularity--and, if we were desired to point\r\nout the meridian moment of his fame, we should fix it perhaps at this\r\nsplendid epoch, before the ill-fated Coalition had damped the confidence\r\nof his friends, or the ascendancy of his great rival had multiplied the\r\nnumber of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThere is an anecdote of Mr. Burke, connected with this period, the\r\ncredibility of which must be left to the reader's own judgment. It is\r\nsaid that, immediately upon the retirement of Mr. Fox, while Lord John\r\nCavendish (whose resignation was for a short time delayed by the\r\ndespatch of some official business) was still a minister, Mr. Burke,\r\nwith a retrospect to the sweets of office which showed that he had not\r\nwholly left hope behind, endeavored to open a negotiation through the\r\nmedium of Lord John, for the purpose of procuring, by some arrangement,\r\neither for himself or his son, a Tellership then in the possession of a\r\nrelative of Lord Orford. It is but fair to add that this curious\r\nanecdote rests chiefly upon the authority of the latter nobleman.\r\n[Footnote: Unpublished Papers.] The degree of faith it receives will,\r\ntherefore, depend upon the balance that may be struck in our comparative\r\nestimate between the disinterestedness of Burke and the veracity of Lord\r\nOrford.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the following session that extraordinary\r\nCoalition was declared, which had the ill-luck attributed to the\r\nconjunction of certain planets, and has shed an unfavorable influence\r\nover the political world ever since. Little is, I believe, known of the\r\nprivate negotiations that led to this ill-assorted union of parties;\r\nbut, from whichever side the first advances may have come, the affair\r\nseems to have been dispatched with the rapidity of a Siamese courtship;\r\nand while to Mr. Eden (afterwards Lord Auckland) is attributed the\r\ncredit of having gained Lord North's consent to the union, Mr. Burke is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been the person, who sung the \"Hymen, oh\r\nHymenae\" in the ears of Mr. Fox.\r\n\r\nWith that sagacity, which in general directed his political views, Mr.\r\nSheridan foresaw all the consequences of such a defiance of public\r\nopinion, and exerted, it is said, the whole power of his persuasion and\r\nreasoning, to turn aside his sanguine and uncalculating friend from a\r\nmeasure so likely to embarrass his future career. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, the advice was not taken,--and a person, who witnessed the\r\nclose of a conversation, in which Sheridan had been making a last effort\r\nto convince Mr. Fox of the imprudence of the step he was about to take,\r\nheard the latter, at parting, express his final resolution in the\r\nfollowing decisive words:--\"It is as fixed as the Hanover succession.\"\r\n\r\nTo the general principle of Coalitions, and the expediency and even duty\r\nof forming them, in conjunctures that require and justify such a\r\nsacrifice of the distinctions of party, no objection, it appears to me,\r\ncan rationally be made by those who are satisfied with the manner in\r\nwhich the Constitution has worked, since the new modification of its\r\nmachinery introduced at the Revolution. The Revolution itself was,\r\nindeed, brought about by a Coalition, in which Tories, surrendering\r\ntheir doctrines of submission, arrayed themselves by the side of Whigs,\r\nin defence of their common liberties. Another Coalition, less important\r\nin its object and effects, but still attended with results most glorious\r\nto the country, was that which took place in the year 1757, when, by a\r\nunion of parties from whose dissension much mischief had flowed, the\r\ninterests of both king and people were reconciled, and the good genius\r\nof England triumphed at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nOn occasions like these, when the public liberty or safety is in peril,\r\nit is the duty of every honest statesman to say, with the Roman, \"_Non\r\nme impedient privatae offensiones, quo minus pro reipublicae salute\r\netian cum inimicissimo consentiam._\" Such cases, however, but rarely\r\noccur; and they have been in this respect, among others, distinguished\r\nfrom the ordinary occasions, on which the ambition or selfishness of\r\npoliticians resorts to such unions, that the voice of the people has\r\ncalled aloud for them in the name of the public weal; and that the cause\r\nround which they have rallied has been sufficiently general, to merge\r\nall party titles in the one undistinguishing name of Englishman. By\r\nneither of these tests can the junction between Lord North and Mr. Fox\r\nbe justified. The people at large, so far from calling for this ill-\r\nomened alliance, would on the contrary--to use the language of Mr. Pitt\r\n--have \"forbid the banns;\" and though it is unfair to suppose that the\r\ninterests of the public did not enter into the calculations of the\r\nunited leaders, yet, if the real watchword of their union were to be\r\ndemanded of them in \"the Palace of Truth,\" there can be little doubt\r\nthat the answer of each would be, distinctly and unhesitatingly,\r\n\"Ambition.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most specious allegations in defence of the measure is, that\r\nthe extraordinary favor which Lord Shelburne enjoyed at court, and the\r\narbitrary tendencies known to prevail in that quarter, portended just\r\nthen such an overflow of Royal influence, as it was necessary to\r\ncounteract by this double embankment of party. In the first place,\r\nhowever, it is by no means so certain that the noble minister at this\r\nperiod did actually enjoy such favor. On the contrary, there is every\r\nreason to believe that his possession of the Royal confidence did not\r\nlong survive that important service, to which he was made instrumental,\r\nof clearing the cabinet of the Whigs; and that, like the bees of Virgil,\r\nhe had left the soul of his own power in the wound which he had been the\r\nmeans of inflicting upon that of others. In the second place, whatever\r\nmight have been the designs of the Court,--and of its encroaching spirit\r\nno doubt can be entertained,--Lord Shelburne had assuredly given no\r\ngrounds for apprehending, that he would ever, like one of the chiefs of\r\nthis combination against him, be brought to lend himself precipitately\r\nor mischievously to its views. Though differing from Mr. Fox on some\r\nimportant points of policy, and following the example of his friend,\r\nLord Chatham, in keeping himself independent of Whig confederacies, he\r\nwas not the less attached to the true principles of that party, and,\r\nthroughout his whole political career, invariably maintained them. This\r\nargument, therefore,--the only plausible one in defence of the\r\nCoalition,--fails in the two chief assumptions on which it is founded.\r\n\r\nIt has been truly said of Coalitions, considered abstractedly, that such\r\na union of parties, when the public good requires it, is to be justified\r\non the same grounds on which party itself is vindicated. But the more we\r\nfeel inclined to acknowledge the utility of party, the more we must\r\ndread and deprecate any unnecessary compromise, by which a suspicion of\r\nunsoundness may be brought upon the agency of so useful a principle--the\r\nmore we should discourage, as a matter of policy, any facility in\r\nsurrendering those badges of opinion, on which the eyes of followers are\r\nfondly fixed, and by which their confidence and spirit are chiefly kept\r\nalive--the more, too, we must lament that a great popular leader, like\r\nMr. Fox, should ever have lightly concurred in such a confusion of the\r\nboundaries of opinion, and, like that mighty river, the Mississippi,\r\nwhose waters lose their own color in mixing with those of the Missouri,\r\nhave sacrificed the distinctive hue of his own political creed, to this\r\nconfluence of interests with a party so totally opposed to it.\r\n\r\n\"Court and country,\" says Hume, [Footnote: Essay \"on the Parties of\r\nGreat Britain.\"] \"which are the genuine offspring of the British\r\ngovernment, are a kind of mixed parties, and are influenced both by\r\nprinciple and by interest. The heads of the factions are commonly most\r\ngoverned by the latter motive; the inferior members of them by the\r\nformer.\" Whether this be altogether true or not, it will, at least,\r\nwithout much difficulty be conceded, that the lower we descend in the\r\natmosphere of party, the more quick and inflammable we find the feeling\r\nthat circulates through it. Accordingly, actions and professions, which,\r\nin that region of indifference, high life, may be forgotten as soon as\r\ndone or uttered, become recorded as pledges and standards of conduct,\r\namong the lower and more earnest adherents of the cause; and many a\r\nquestion, that has ceased to furnish even a jest in the drawing-rooms of\r\nthe great, may be still agitated, as of vital importance, among the\r\nhumbler and less initiated disputants of the party. Such being the\r\ntenacious nature of partisanship, and such the watch kept upon every\r\nmovement of the higher political bodies, we can well imagine what a\r\nportent it must appear to distant and unprepared observers, when the\r\nstars to which they trusted for guidance are seen to \"shoot madly from\r\ntheir spheres,\" and not only lose themselves for the time in another\r\nsystem, but unsettle all calculations with respect to their movements\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nThe steps by which, in general, the principles in such transactions are\r\ngradually reconciled to their own inconsistency--the negotiations that\r\nprecede and soften down the most salient difficulties--the value of the\r\nadvantages gained, in return for opinions sacrificed--the new points of\r\ncontact brought out by a change of circumstances, and the abatement or\r\nextinction of former differences, by the remission or removal of the\r\ncauses that provoked them,--all these conciliatory gradations and\r\nbalancing adjustments, which to those who are in the secret may account\r\nfor, and more or less justify, the alliance of statesmen who differ in\r\ntheir general views of politics, are with difficulty, if at all, to be\r\nexplained to the remote multitude of the party, whose habit it is to\r\njudge and feel in the gross, and who, as in the case of Lord North and\r\nMr. Fox, can see only the broad and but too intelligible fact, that the\r\nleaders for whom both parties had sacrificed so much--those on one side\r\ntheir interest, and those on the other, perhaps, their consciences--had\r\ndeserted them to patch up a suspicious alliance with each other, the\r\nonly open and visible motive to which was the spoil that it enabled them\r\nto partition between them.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, in that barter of opinions and interests, which must\r\nnecessarily take place in Coalitions between the partisans of the People\r\nand of the Throne, the former had any thing like an equality of chance,\r\nthe mere probability of gaining thus any concessions in favor of freedom\r\nmight justify to sanguine minds the occasional risk of the compromise.\r\nBut it is evident that the result of such bargains must generally be to\r\nthe advantage of the Crown--the alluvions of power all naturally tend\r\ntowards that shore. Besides, where there are places as well as\r\nprinciples to be surrendered on one side, there must in return be so\r\nmuch more of principles given up on the other, as will constitute an\r\nequivalent to this double sacrifice. The centre of gravity will be sure\r\nto lie in that body, which contains within it the source of emoluments\r\nand honors, and the other will be forced to revolve implicitly round it.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion at this period on which Mr. Sheridan seems to have\r\nalluded to the Coalition, was during a speech of some length on the\r\nconsideration of the Preliminary Articles of Peace. Finding himself\r\nobliged to advert to the subject, he chose rather to recriminate on the\r\nopposite party for the anomaly of their own alliances, than to vindicate\r\nthat which his distinguished friend had just formed, and which, in his\r\nheart, as has been already stated, he wholly disapproved. The\r\ninconsistency of the Tory Lord Advocate (Dundas) in connecting himself\r\nwith the patron of Equal Representation, Mr. Pitt, and his support of\r\nthat full recognition of American independence, against which, under the\r\nbanners of Lord North, he had so obstinately combated, afforded to\r\nSheridan's powers of raillery an opportunity of display, of which, there\r\nis no doubt, he with his accustomed felicity availed himself. The\r\nreporter of the speech, however, has, as usual, contrived, with an art\r\nnear akin to that of reducing diamonds to charcoal, to turn all the\r\nbrilliancy of his wit into dull and opake verbiage.\r\n\r\nIt was during this same debate, that he produced that happy retort upon\r\nMr. Pitt, which, for good-humored point and seasonableness, has seldom,\r\nif ever, been equalled.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pitt (say the Parliamentary Reports) was pointedly severe on the\r\ngentlemen who had spoken against the Address, and particularly on Mr.\r\nSheridan. 'No man admired more than he did the abilities of that Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman, the elegant sallies of his thought, the gay\r\neffusions of his fancy, his dramatic turns and his epigrammatic point;\r\nand if they were reserved for the proper stage, they would, no doubt,\r\nreceive what the Honorable Gentleman's abilities always did receive, the\r\nplaudits of the audience; and it would be his fortune \"_sui plausu\r\ngaudere theatri_.\" But this was not the proper scene for the\r\nexhibition of those elegancies.' Mr. Sheridan, in rising to explain,\r\nsaid that 'On the particular sort of personality which the Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman had thought proper to make use of, he need not make\r\nany comment. The propriety, the taste, the gentlemanly point of it, must\r\nhave been obvious to the House. But, said Mr. Sheridan, let me assure\r\nthe Right Honorable gentleman, that I do now, and will at any time he\r\nchooses to repeat this sort of allusion, meet it with the most sincere\r\ngood-humor. Nay, I will say more--flattered and encouraged by the Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman's panegyric on my talents, if ever I again engage in\r\nthe compositions he alludes to, I maybe tempted to an act of\r\npresumption--to attempt an improvement on one of Ben Jonson's best\r\ncharacters, the character of the Angry Boy in the Alchymist.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan's connection with the stage, though one of the most\r\npermanent sources of his glory, was also a point, upon which, at the\r\ncommencement of his political career, his pride was most easily awakened\r\nand alarmed. He, himself, used to tell of the frequent mortifications\r\nwhich he had suffered, when at school, from taunting allusions to his\r\nfather's profession--being called by some of his school-fellows \"the\r\nplayer-boy,\" &c. Mr. Pitt had therefore selected the most sensitive spot\r\nfor his sarcasm; and the good temper as well as keenness, with which the\r\nthrust was returned, must have been felt even through all that pride of\r\nyouth and talent, in which the new Chancellor of the Exchequer was then\r\nenveloped. There could hardly, indeed, have been a much greater service\r\nrendered to a person in the situation of Mr. Sheridan, than thus\r\naffording him an opportunity of silencing, once for all, a battery to\r\nwhich this weak point of his pride was exposed, and by which he might\r\notherwise have been kept in continual alarm. This gentlemanlike retort,\r\ncombined with the recollection of his duel, tended to place him for the\r\nfuture in perfect security against any indiscreet tamperings with his\r\npersonal history. [Footnote: The following _jeu d'esprit_, written\r\nby Sheridan himself upon this occurrence, has been found among his\r\nmanuscripts:--\r\n\r\n\"ADVERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\n\"We hear that, in consequence of a hint, lately given in the House of\r\nCommons, the Play of the Alchemist is certainly to be performed by a set\r\nof Gentlemen for our diversion in a private apartment of Buckingham\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\"The Characters, thus described in the old editions of Ben Jonson, are\r\nto be represented in the following manner--the old practice of men's\r\nplaying the female parts being adopted.\r\n\r\n  \"SUBTLE (_the Alchemist_)           Lord Sh--Ib--e.\r\n  FACE (_the House-keeper_)           The Lord Ch--ll--r.\r\n  DOLL COMMON (_their Colleague_)     The L--d Adv--c--te.\r\n  DRUGGER (_a Tobacco-man_)           Lord Eff--ng--m.\r\n  EPICURE MAMMON                           Mr. R--by.\r\n  TRIBULATION                              Dr. J--nk--s--n.\r\n  ANANIAS (_a little Pastor_)         Mr. H--ll.\r\n  KASTRILL (_the Angry Boy_)          Mr. W.

His defence of the\r\nReceipt Tax,--which, like all other long-lived taxes, was born with\r\ndifficulty,--appears, as far as we can judge of it from the Report, to\r\nhave been highly amusing. Some country-gentleman having recommended a\r\ntax upon grave-stones as a substitute for it, Sheridan replied that:\r\n\r\n\"Such a tax, indeed, was not easily evaded, and could not be deemed\r\noppressive, as it would only be once paid; but so great was the spirit\r\nof clamor against the tax on receipts, that he should not wonder if it\r\nextended to them; and that it should be asserted, that persons having\r\npaid the last debt,--the debt of nature,--government had resolved they\r\nshould pay a receipt-tax, and have it stamped over their grave. Nay,\r\nwith so extraordinary a degree of inveteracy were some Committees in the\r\ncity, and elsewhere, actuated, that if a receipt-tax of the nature in\r\nquestion was enacted, he should not be greatly surprised if it were soon\r\nafter published, that such Committees had unanimously resolved that they\r\nwould never be buried, in order to avoid paying the tax; but had\r\ndetermined to lie above ground, or have their ashes consigned to family-\r\nurns, in the manner of the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nHe also took an active share in the discussions relative to the\r\nrestoration of Powell and Bembridge to their offices by Mr. Burke:--a\r\ntransaction which, without fixing any direct stigma upon that eminent\r\nman, subjected him, at least, to the unlucky suspicion of being less\r\nscrupulous in his notions of official purity, than became the party\r\nwhich he espoused or the principles of Reform that he inculcated.\r\n\r\nLittle as the Court was disposed, during the late reign, to retain Whigs\r\nin its service any longer than was absolutely necessary, it must be\r\nowned that neither did the latter, in general, take very courtier-like\r\nmodes of continuing their connection with Royalty; but rather chose to\r\nmeet the hostility of the Crown half-way, by some overt act of\r\nimprudence or courage, which at once brought the matter to an issue\r\nbetween them. Of this hardihood the India Bill of Mr. Fox was a\r\nremarkable example--and he was himself fully aware of the risk which he\r\nran in proposing it. \"He knew,\" he said, in his speech upon first\r\nbringing forward the question, \"that the task he had that day set\r\nhimself was extremely arduous and difficult; he knew that he had\r\nconsiderable risk in it; but when he took upon himself an office of\r\nresponsibility, he had made up his mind to the situation and the danger\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nWithout agreeing with those who impute to Mr. Fox the extravagant design\r\nof investing himself, by means of this Bill, with a sort of perpetual\r\nWhig Dictatorship, independent of the will of the Crown, it must\r\nnevertheless be allowed that, together with the interests of India,\r\nwhich were the main object of this decisive measure, the future\r\ninterests and influence of his own party were in no small degree\r\nprovided for; and that a foundation was laid by it for their attainment\r\nof a more steady footing in power than, from the indisposition of the\r\nCourt towards them, they had yet been able to accomplish. Regarding--as\r\nhe well might, after so long an experience of Tory misrule--a government\r\nupon Whig principles as essential to the true interests of England, and\r\nhopeless of seeing the experiment at all fairly tried, as long as the\r\npolitical existence of the servants of the Crown was left dependent upon\r\nthe caprice or treachery of their master, he would naturally welcome\r\nsuch an accession to the influence of the party as might strengthen\r\ntheir claims to power when out of office, and render their possession of\r\nit, when in, more secure and useful. These objects the Bill in question\r\nwould have, no doubt, effected. By turning the Pactolus of Indian\r\npatronage into the territories of Whiggism, it would have attracted new\r\nswarms of settlers to that region,--the Court would have found itself\r\noutbid in the market,--and, however the principles of the party might\r\neventually have fared, the party itself would have been so far\r\ntriumphant. It was indeed, probably, the despair of ever obtaining\r\nadmission for Whiggism, in its unalloyed state, into the councils of the\r\nSovereign, that reconciled Mr. Fox to the rash step of debasing it down\r\nto the Court standard by the Coalition--and, having once gained\r\npossession of power by these means, he saw, in the splendid provisions\r\nof the India Bill, a chance of being able to transmit it as an heir-loom\r\nto his party, which, though conscious of the hazard, he was determined\r\nto try. If his intention, therefore, was, as his enemies say, to\r\nestablish a Dictatorship in his own person, it was, at the worst, such a\r\nDictatorship as the Romans sometimes created, for the purpose of\r\naverting the plague--and would have been directed merely against that\r\npestilence of Toryism, under which the prosperity of England had, he\r\nthought, languished so long.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly, however, to be expected of Royalty,--even after the\r\ndouble humiliation which it had suffered, in being vanquished by rebels\r\nunder one branch of the Coalition, and browbeaten into acknowledging\r\ntheir independence by the other--that it would tamely submit to such an\r\nundisguised invasion of its sanctuary; particularly when the intruders\r\nhad contrived their operations so ill, as to array the people in\r\nhostility against them, as well as the Throne. Never was there an outcry\r\nagainst a ministry so general and decisive. Dismissed insultingly by the\r\nKing on one side, they had to encounter the indignation of the people on\r\nthe other; and, though the House of Commons, with a fidelity to fallen\r\nministers sufficiently rare, stood by them for a time in a desperate\r\nstruggle with their successors, the voice of the Royal Prerogative, like\r\nthe horn of Astolpho, soon scattered the whole body in consternation\r\namong their constituents, _\"di qua, di la, di su, di giu,\"_ and the\r\nresult was a complete and long-enjoyed triumph to the Throne and Mr.\r\nPitt.\r\n\r\nThough the name of Mr. Fox is indissolubly connected with this Bill, and\r\nthough he bore it aloft, as fondly as Caesar did his own Commentaries,\r\nthrough all this troubled sea of opposition, it is to Mr. Burke that the\r\nfirst daring outline of the plan, as well as the chief materials for\r\nfilling it up, are to be attributed,--whilst to Sir Arthur Pigot's able\r\nhand was entrusted the legal task of drawing the Bill. The intense\r\ninterest which Burke took in the affairs of India had led him to lay in\r\nsuch stores of information on the subject, as naturally gave him the\r\nlead in all deliberations connected with it. His labors for the Select\r\nCommittee, the Ninth Report of which is pregnant with his mighty mind,\r\nmay be considered as the source and foundation of this Bill--while of\r\nthe under-plot, which had in view the strengthening of the Whig\r\ninterest, we find the germ in his \"Thoughts on the present Discontents,\"\r\nwhere, in pointing out the advantage to England of being ruled by such a\r\nconfederacy, he says, \"In one of the most fortunate periods of our\r\nhistory, this country was governed by a connection; I mean the great\r\nconnection of Whigs in the reign of Queen Anne.\"\r\n\r\nBurke was, indeed, at this time the actuating spirit of the party--as he\r\nmust have been of any party to which he attached himself. Keeping, as he\r\ndid, the double engines of his genius and his industry incessantly in\r\nplay over the minds of his more indolent colleagues, with an intentness\r\nof purpose that nothing could divert, and an impetuosity of temper that\r\nnothing could resist, it is not wonderful that he should have gained\r\nsuch an entire mastery over their wills, or that the party who obeyed\r\nhim should so long have exhibited the mark of his rash spirit imprinted\r\nupon their measures. The yielding temper of Mr. Fox, together with his\r\nunbounded admiration of Burke, led him easily, in the first instance, to\r\nacquiesce in the views of his friend, and then the ardor of his own\r\nnature, and the self-kindling power of his eloquence, threw an\r\nearnestness and fire into his public enforcement of those views, which\r\nmade even himself forget that they were but adopted from another, and\r\nimpressed upon his hearers the conviction that they were all, and from\r\nthe first, his own.\r\n\r\nWe read his speeches in defence of the India Bill with a sort of\r\nbreathless anxiety, which no other political discourses, except those,\r\nperhaps, of Demosthenes, could produce. The importance of the stake\r\nwhich he risks--the boldness of his plan--the gallantry with which he\r\nflings himself into the struggle, and the frankness of personal feeling\r\nthat breathes throughout--all throw around him an interest, like that\r\nwhich encircles a hero of romance; nor could the most candid\r\nautobiography that ever was written exhibit the whole character of the\r\nman more transparently through it.\r\n\r\nThe death of this ill-fated Ministry was worthy of its birth.\r\nOriginating in a Coalition of Whigs and Tories, which compromised the\r\n_principles_ of freedom, it was destroyed by a Coalition of King\r\nand People, which is even, perhaps, more dangerous to its\r\n_practice_. [Footnote: \"This assumption (says Burke) of the\r\nTribunitian power by the Sovereign was truly alarming. When Augustus\r\nCaesar modestly consented to become the Tribune of the people, Rome gave\r\nup into the hands of that prince the only remaining shield she had to\r\nprotect her liberty. The Tribunitian power in this country, as in\r\nancient Rome, was wisely kept distinct and separate from the executive\r\npower; in this government it was constitutionally lodged where it was\r\nnaturally to be lodged, in the House of Commons; and to that House the\r\npeople ought first to carry their complaints, even when they were\r\ndirected against the measures of the House itself. But now the people\r\nwere taught to pass by the door of the House of Commons and supplicate\r\nthe Throne for the protection of their liberties.\"--_Speech on moving\r\nhis Representation to the King, in June_, 1784.]\r\n\r\nThe conduct, indeed, of all estates and parties, during this short\r\ninterval, was any thing but laudable. The leaven of the unlucky alliance\r\nwith Lord North was but too visible in many of the measures of the\r\nMinistry--in the jobbing terms of the loan, the resistance to Mr. Pitt's\r\nplan of retrenchment, and the diminished numbers on the side of\r\nParliamentary Reform. [Footnote: The consequences of this alloy were\r\nstill more visible in Ireland. \"The Coalition Ministry,\" says Mr. Hardy,\r\n\"displayed itself in various employments--but there was no harmony. The\r\nold courtiers hated the new, and being more dexterous, were more\r\nsuccessful.\" In stating that Lord Charlemont was but coldly received by\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant, Lord Northington, Mr. Hardy adds, \"It is to be\r\npresumed that some of the old Court, who in consequence of the Coalition\r\nhad crept once more into favor, influenced his conduct in this\r\nparticular.\"] On the other hand, Mr. Pitt and his party, in their\r\neagerness for place, did not hesitate to avail themselves of the\r\nambidexterous and unworthy trick of representing the India Bill to the\r\npeople, as a Tory plan for the increase of Royal influence, and to the\r\nKing, as a Whig conspiracy for the curtailment of it. The King himself,\r\nin his arbitrary interference with the deliberations of the Lords, and\r\nthe Lords, in the prompt servility with which so many of them obeyed his\r\nbidding, gave specimens of their respective branches of the\r\nConstitution, by no means creditable--while finally the people, by the\r\nunanimous outcry with which they rose, in defence of the monopoly of\r\nLeadenhall Street and the sovereign will of the Court, proved how little\r\nof the \"_vox Dei_\" there may sometimes be in such clamor.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan seems to have spoken but once during the discussions on the\r\nIndia Bill, and that was on the third reading, when it was carried so\r\ntriumphantly through the House of Commons. The report of his speech is\r\nintroduced with the usual tantalizing epithets, \"witty,\" \"entertaining,\"\r\n&c. &c.; but, as usual, entails disappointment in the perusal--\"_at\r\ncum intraveris, Dii Deceque, quam nihil in medio invenies!_\"\r\n[Footnote: Pliny] There is only one of the announced pleasantries\r\nforthcoming, in any shape, through the speech. Mr. Scott (the present\r\nLord Eldon) had, in the course of the debate, indulged in a license of\r\nScriptural parody, which he would himself, no doubt, be among the first\r\nto stigmatize as blasphemy in others, and had affected to discover the\r\nrudiments of the India Bill in a Chapter of the Book of Revelations,--\r\nBabylon being the East India Company, Mr. Fox and his seven\r\nCommissioners the Beast with the seven heads, and the marks on the hand\r\nand forehead, imprinted by the Beast upon those around him, meaning,\r\nevidently, he said, the peerages, pensions, and places distributed by\r\nthe minister. In answering this strange sally of forensic wit, Mr.\r\nSheridan quoted other passages from the same Sacred Book, which (as the\r\nReporter gravely assures us) \"told strongly for the Bill,\" and which\r\nproved that Lord Fitz-william and his fellow-commissioners, instead of\r\nbeing the seven heads of the Beast, were seven Angels \"clothed in pure\r\nand white linen!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES.--FINANCIAL MEASURES.--MR. PITT'S EAST INDIA BILL.--\r\nIRISH COMMERCIAL PROPOSITIONS.--PLAN OF THE DUKE OF RICHMOND.--SINKING\r\nFUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, who had now every reason to be convinced of the aversion with\r\nwhich they were regarded at court, had lately been, in some degree,\r\ncompensated for this misfortune by the accession to their party of the\r\nHeir Apparent, who had, since the year 1783, been in the enjoyment of a\r\nseparate establishment, and taken his seat in the House of Peers as Duke\r\nof Cornwall. That a young prince, fond of pleasure and impatient of\r\nrestraint, should have thrown himself into the arms of those who were\r\nmost likely to be indulgent to his errors, is nothing surprising, either\r\nin politics or ethics. But that mature and enlightened statesmen, with\r\nthe lessons of all history before their eyes, should have been equally\r\nready to embrace such a rash alliance, or should count upon it as any\r\nmore than a temporary instrument of faction, is, to say the least of it,\r\none of those self-delusions of the wise, which show how vainly the voice\r\nof the Past may speak amid the loud appeals and temptations of the\r\nPresent. The last Prince of Wales, it is true, by whom the popular cause\r\nwas espoused, had left the lesson imperfect, by dying before he came to\r\nthe throne. But this deficiency has since been amply made up; and future\r\nWhigs, who may be placed in similar circumstances, will have, at least,\r\none historical warning before their eyes, which ought to be enough to\r\nsatisfy the most unreflecting and credulous.\r\n\r\nIn some points, the breach that now took place between the Prince and\r\nthe King, bore a close resemblance to that which had disturbed the\r\npreceding reign. In both cases, the Royal parents were harsh and\r\nobstinate--in both cases, money was the chief source of dissension--and,\r\nin both cases, the genius, wit, and accomplishments of those with whom\r\nthe Heir Apparent connected himself, threw a splendor round the\r\npolitical bond between them, which prevented even themselves from\r\nperceiving its looseness and fragility.\r\n\r\nIn the late question of Mr. Fox's India Bill, the Prince of Wales had\r\nvoted with his political friends in the first division. But, upon\r\nfinding afterwards that the King was hostile to the measure, his Royal\r\nHighness took the prudent step (and with Mr. Fox's full concurrence) of\r\nabsenting himself entirely from the second discussion, when the Bill, as\r\nit is known, was finally defeated. This circumstance, occurring thus\r\nearly in their intercourse, might have proved to each of the parties in\r\nthis ill-sorted alliance, how difficult it was for them to remain long\r\nand creditably united. [Footnote: The following sensible remarks upon\r\nthe first interruption of the political connection between the Heir\r\nApparent and the Opposition, are from an unfinished Life of Mr. Sheridan\r\nnow in my possession--written by one whose boyhood was passed in the\r\nsociety of the great men whom he undertook to commemorate, and whose\r\nstation and talents would have given to such a work an authenticity and\r\nvalue, that would have rendered the humble memorial, which I have\r\nattempted, unnecessary--\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness acted upon this occasion by Mr. Fox's advice and\r\nwith perfect propriety. At the same time the necessity under which he\r\nfound himself of so acting may serve as a general warning to Princes of\r\nthe Blood in this country, to abstain from connecting themselves with\r\nparty, and engaging either as active supporters or opponents of the\r\nadministration of the day. The ties of family, the obligations of their\r\nsituation, the feelings of the public assuredly will condemn them, at\r\nsome time or other, as in the present instance to desert their own\r\npublic acts, to fail in their private professions, and to leave their\r\nfriends at the very moment, in which service and support are the most\r\nimperiously required.\r\n\r\n\"Princes are always suspected proselytes to the popular side. Conscious\r\nof this suspicion, they strive to do it away by exaggerated professions,\r\nand by bringing to the party which they espouse more violent opinions\r\nand more unmeasured language than any which they find. These mighty\r\npromises they soon find it unreasonable, impossible, inconvenient to\r\nfulfil. Their dereliction of their principles becomes manifest and\r\nindefensible, in proportion to the vehemence with which they have\r\npledged themselves always to maintain them, and the contempt and\r\nindignation which accompanies their retreat is equivalent to the\r\nexpectations excited by the boldness and determination of their\r\nadvance.\"] On the one side, there was a character to be maintained with\r\nthe people, which a too complaisant toleration of the errors of royalty\r\nmight--and, as it happened, _did_ compromise; while, on the other\r\nside, there were the obligations of filial duty, which, as in this\r\ninstance of the India Bill, made desertion decorous, at a time when co-\r\noperation would have been most friendly and desirable. There was also\r\nthe perpetual consciousness of being destined to a higher station, in\r\nwhich, while duty would perhaps demand an independence of all party\r\nwhatever, convenience would certainly dictate a release from the\r\nrestraints of Whiggism.\r\n\r\nIt was most fortunate for Mr. Sheridan, on the rout of his party that\r\nensued, to find himself safe in his seat for Stafford once more, and the\r\nfollowing document, connected with his election, is sufficiently\r\ncurious, in more respects than one, to be laid before the reader:\r\n\r\n_R.

L2,165 5 0\r\n\r\nThe followers of the Coalition had been defeated in almost all\r\ndirections, and it was computed that no less than 160 of them had been\r\nleft upon the field,--with no other consolation than what their own wit\r\nafforded them, in the title which they bestowed upon themselves of\r\n\"Fox's Martyrs.\"\r\n\r\nThis reduction in the ranks of his enemies, at the very commencement of\r\nhis career, left an open space for the youthful minister, which was most\r\nfavorable to the free display of his energies. He had, indeed, been\r\nindebted, throughout the whole struggle, full as much to a lucky\r\nconcurrence of circumstances as to his talents and name for the\r\nsupremacy to which he so rapidly rose. All the other eminent persons of\r\nthe day had either deeply entangled themselves in party ties, or taken\r\nthe gloss off their reputations by some unsuccessful or unpopular\r\nmeasures; and as he was the only man independent enough of the House of\r\nCommons to be employed by the King as a weapon against it, so was he the\r\nonly one sufficiently untried in public life, to be able to draw\r\nunlimitedly on the confidence of the people, and array them, as he did,\r\nin all the enthusiasm of ignorance, on his side. Without these two\r\nadvantages, which he owed to his youth and inexperience, even loftier\r\ntalents than his would have fallen far short of his triumph.\r\n\r\nThe financial affairs of the country, which the war had considerably\r\nderanged, and which none of the ministries that ensued felt sure enough\r\nof themselves to attend to, were, of course, among the first and most\r\nanxious objects of his administration; and the wisdom of the measures\r\nwhich he brought forward for their amelioration was not only candidly\r\nacknowledged by his opponents at the time, but forms at present the\r\nleast disputable ground, upon which his claim to reputation as a\r\nfinance-minister rests. Having found, on his accession to power, an\r\nannual deficiency of several millions in the revenue, he, in the course\r\nof two years, raised the income of the country so high as to afford a\r\nsurplus for the establishment of his Sinking Fund. Nor did his merit lie\r\nonly in the mere increase of income, but in the generally sound\r\nprinciples of the taxation by which he accomplished it, in the\r\nimprovements introduced into the collection of the revenue, and the\r\nreform effected in the offices connected with it, by the simplification\r\nof the mode of keeping public accounts.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Sheridan delivered his opinion upon many of the taxes\r\nproposed, his objections were rather to the details than the general\r\nobject of the measures; and it may be reckoned, indeed, a part of the\r\ngood fortune of the minister, that the financial department of\r\nOpposition at this time was not assumed by any more adventurous\r\ncalculator, who might have perplexed him, at least by ingenious cavils,\r\nhowever he might have failed to defeat him by argument. As it was, he\r\nhad the field almost entirely to himself; for Sheridan, though acute,\r\nwas not industrious enough to be formidable, and Mr. Fox, from a\r\nstruggle, perhaps, between candor and party-feeling, absented himself\r\nalmost entirely from the discussion of the new taxes. [Footnote: \"He had\r\nabsented himself,\" he said, \"upon principle; that, though he might not\r\nbe able to approve of the measures which had been adopted, he did not at\r\nthe same time think himself authorized to condemn them, or to give them\r\nopposition, unless he had been ready to suggest others less distressing\r\nto the subject.\"--_Speech on Navy Bills, &c. &c._]\r\n\r\nThe only questions, in which the angry spirit of the late conflict still\r\nsurvived, were the Westminster Scrutiny and Mr. Pitt's East India Bill.\r\nThe conduct of the minister in the former transaction showed that his\r\nvictory had not brought with it those generous feelings towards the\r\nvanquished, which, in the higher order of minds, follows as naturally as\r\nthe calm after a tempest. There must, indeed, have been something\r\npeculiarly harsh and unjust in the proceedings against his great rival\r\non this occasion, which could induce so many of the friends of the\r\nminister--then in the fulness of his popularity and power--to leave him\r\nin a minority and vote against the continuance of the Scrutiny. To this\r\npersecution, however, we are indebted for a speech of Mr. Fox, which is\r\n(as he, himself, in his opening, pronounced it would be) one of his best\r\nand noblest; and which is reported, too, with such evident fidelity, as\r\nwell as spirit, that we seem to hear, while we read, the _\"Demosthenem\r\nipsum\"_ uttering it.\r\n\r\nSheridan had, it appears, written a letter, about this time, to his\r\nbrother Charles, in which, after expressing the feelings of himself and\r\nhis brother Whigs, at the late unconstitutional victory over their\r\nparty, he added, \"But you are all so void of principle, in Ireland, that\r\nyou cannot enter into our situation.\" Charles Sheridan, who, in the late\r\nchanges, had not thought it necessary to pay his principles the\r\ncompliment of sacrificing his place to them, considered himself, of\r\ncourse, as included in this stigma; and the defence of time-serving\r\npolitics which he has set up in his answer, if not so eloquent as that\r\nof the great Roman man master of this art in his letter to Lentulus, is,\r\nat least, as self-conscious and labored, and betrays altogether a\r\nfeeling but too worthy of the political meridian from which it issued.\r\n\r\n\"Dublin Castle, 10th March, 1784.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR DICK,\r\n\r\n\"I am much obliged to you for the letter you sent me by Orde; I began to\r\nthink you had forgot I was in existence, but I forgive your past silence\r\non account of your recent kind attention. The new Irish administration\r\nhave come with the olive branch in their hand, and very wisely, I think;\r\nthe system, the circumstances, and the manners of the two countries are\r\nso totally different, that I can assure you nothing could be so absurd\r\nas any attempt to extend the party-distinctions which prevail on your\r\nside of the water, to this. Nothing, I will venture to assert, can\r\npossibly preserve the connection between England and Ireland, but a\r\npermanent government here, acting upon fixed principles, and pursuing\r\nsystematic measures. For this reason a change of Chief Governor, ought\r\nto be nothing more than a simple transfer of government, and by no means\r\nto make any change in that political system respecting this country\r\nwhich England must adopt, let who will be the minister and whichever\r\nparty may acquire the ascendancy, if she means to preserve Ireland as a\r\npart of the British empire.\r\n\r\n\"You will say this is a very good plan for people in place, as it tends\r\nto secure them against all contingencies, but this, I give you my word,\r\nis not my reason for thinking as I do. I must, in the first place,\r\nacquaint you that there never can be hereafter in this country any such\r\nthing as party connections founded upon political principles; we have\r\nobtained all the great objects for which Ireland had contended for many\r\nyears, and there does not now remain one national object of sufficient\r\nimportance to unite men in the same pursuit. Nothing but such objects\r\never did unite men in this kingdom, and that not from principle, but\r\nbecause the spirit of the people was so far roused with respect to\r\npoints in which the pride, the interest, the commerce, and the\r\nprosperity of the nation at large was so materially concerned, that the\r\nHouse of Commons, if they had not the virtue to forward, at least wanted\r\nthe courage to oppose, the general and determined wish of the whole\r\nkingdom; they therefore made a virtue of necessity, joined the standard\r\nof a very small popular party; both _Ins_ and _Outs_ voted\r\nequally against government, the latter of course, and the former because\r\neach individual thought himself safe in the number who followed his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\"This is the only instance, I believe, in the history of Irish politics,\r\nwhere a party ever appeared to act upon public principle, and as the\r\ncause of this singular instance has been removed by the attainment of\r\nthe only objects which could have united men in one pursuit, it is not\r\nprobable that we shall in future furnish any other example that will do\r\nhonor to our public spirit. If you reflect an instant, you will perceive\r\nthat our subordinate situation necessarily prevents the formation of any\r\nparty among us, like those you have in England, composed of persons\r\nacting upon certain principles, and pledged to support each other. I am\r\nwilling to allow you that your exertions are directed by public spirit;\r\nbut if those exertions did not lead to _power_, you must\r\nacknowledge that it is probable they would not be made, or, if made,\r\nthat they would not be of much use. The object of a party in England is\r\neither to obtain power for themselves, or to take it from those who are\r\nin possession of it--they may do this from the purest motives, and with\r\nthe truest regard for the public good, but still you must allow that\r\npower is a very tempting object, the hopes of obtaining it no small\r\nincentive to their exertions, and the consequences of success to the\r\nindividuals of which the party is composed, no small strengthening to\r\nthe bands which unite them together. Now, if you were to expect similar\r\nparties to be formed in Ireland, you would exact of us more virtue than\r\nis necessary for yourselves. From the peculiar situation of this country\r\nit is impossible that the exertions of any party here can ever lead to\r\n_power_. Here then is one very tempting object placed out of our\r\nreach, and, with it, all those looked-for consequences to individuals,\r\nwhich, with you, induce them to pledge themselves to each other; so that\r\nnothing but poor public spirit would be left to keep our Irish party\r\ntogether, and consequently a greater degree of disinterestedness would\r\nbe necessary in them, than is requisite in one of your English parties.\r\n\r\n\"That no party exertion here can ever lead to power is obvious when you\r\nreflect, that we have in fact no _Irish government_; all power here\r\nbeing lodged in a branch of the _English_ government, we have no\r\ncabinet, no administration of our own, no great offices of state, every\r\noffice we have is merely ministerial, it confers no power but that of\r\ngiving advice, which may or may not be followed by the Chief Governor.\r\nAs all power, therefore, is lodged solely in the English government, of\r\nwhich the Irish is only a branch, it necessarily follows that no\r\nexertion of any party here could ever lead to power, unless they\r\noverturned the English government in this country, or unless the efforts\r\nof such a party in the Irish House of Commons could overturn the British\r\nadministration in England, and the leaders of it get into their places;\r\n--the first, you will allow, would not be a very wise object, and the\r\nlatter you must acknowledge to be impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the same principle, it would be found very difficult to form a\r\nparty in this country which should co-operate with any particular party\r\nin England, and consent to stand or fall with them. The great leading\r\ninterests in this kingdom are of course strongly averse to forming any\r\nsuch connections on your side of the water, as it would tend to create a\r\nfluctuation in the affairs of this country, that would destroy all their\r\nconsequence; and, as to the personal friends which a party in England\r\nmay possibly have in this country, they must in the nature of things be\r\nfew in number, and consequently could only injure themselves by\r\nfollowing the fortunes of a party in England, without being able to\r\nrender that party the smallest service. And, at all events, to such\r\npersons this could be nothing but a losing game. It would be, to refuse\r\nto avail themselves of their connections or talents in order to obtain\r\noffice or honors, and to rest all their pretensions upon the success of\r\na party in another kingdom, to which success they could not in the\r\nsmallest degree contribute. You will admit that to a party in England,\r\nno friends on this side of the water would be worth having who did not\r\npossess connections or talents; and if they did possess these, they must\r\nof course force themselves into station, let the government of this\r\ncountry be in whose hands it may, and that upon a much more permanent\r\nfooting than if they were connected with a party in England. What\r\ntherefore could they gain by such a connection? nothing but the virtue\r\nof self-denial, in continuing out of office as long as their friends\r\nwere so, the chance of coming in when their friends obtained power, and\r\nonly the chance, for there are interests in this country which must not\r\nbe offended; and the certainty of going out whenever their friends in\r\nEngland should be dismissed. So that they would exchange the certainty\r\nof station upon a permanent footing acquired by their own efforts,\r\nconnections or talents, for the chance of station upon a most precarious\r\nfooting, in which they would be placed in the insignificant predicament\r\nof doing nothing for themselves, and resting their hopes and ambition\r\nupon the labors of others.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to what I have said respecting the consequences of the\r\nsubordinate situation of this country, you are to take into\r\nconsideration how peculiarly its inhabitants are circumstanced. Two out\r\nof three millions are Roman Catholics--I believe the proportion is still\r\nlarger--and two-thirds of the remainder are violent rank Presbyterians,\r\nwho have always been, but most particularly of late, strongly averse to\r\nall government placed in the hands of the members of the church of\r\nEngland; nine-tenths of the property, the landed property of the country\r\nI mean, is in the possession of the latter. You will readily conceive\r\nhow much these circumstances must give persons of property in this\r\nkingdom a leaning towards government; how necessarily they must make\r\nthem apprehensive for themselves, placed between such potent enemies;\r\nand how naturally it must make them look up to English government, in\r\nwhatever hands it may be, for that strength and support, which the\r\nsmallness of their numbers prevents their finding among themselves; and\r\nconsequently you will equally perceive that those political or party\r\nprinciples which create such serious differences among you in England,\r\nare matters of small importance to the persons of landed property in\r\nthis country, when compared with the necessity of their having the\r\nconstant support of an English government. Here, my dear Dick, is a very\r\nlong answer to a very few lines in your postscript. But I could not\r\navoid _boring_ you on the subject, when you say 'that we are all so\r\nvoid of principle that we cannot enter into your situation.'\r\n\r\n\"I have received with the greatest pleasure the accounts of the very\r\nconsiderable figure you have made this sessions in the House of Commons.\r\nAs I have no doubt but that your Parliament will be dissolved, God send\r\nyou success a second time at Stafford, and the same to your friend at\r\nWestminster. I will not forgive you if you do not give me the first\r\nintelligence of both those events. I shall say nothing to you on the\r\nsubject of your English politics, only that I feel myself much more\r\npartial to one side of the question than, in my present situation, it\r\nwould be of any use to me to avow. I am the happiest domestic man in the\r\nworld, and am in daily expectation of an addition to that happiness, and\r\nown that a home, which I never leave without regret, nor return to\r\nwithout delight, has somewhat abated my passion for politics, and that\r\nwarmth I once felt about public questions. But it has not abated the\r\nwarmth of my private friendships; it has not abated my regard for\r\nFitzpatrick, my anxiety for you, and the warmth of my wishes for the\r\nsuccess of your friends, considering them as such. I beg my love to Mrs.\r\nSheridan and Tom, and am, dear Dick,\r\n\r\n\"Most affectionately yours, C. F. Sheridan.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Bill for the better government of India, which Mr.\r\nPitt substituted for that of his defeated rival, its provisions are now,\r\nfrom long experience, so familiarly known, that it would be superfluous\r\nto dwell upon either their merits or defects. [Footnote: Three of the\r\nprincipal provisions were copied from the Propositions of Lord North in\r\n1781--in allusion to which Mr. Powys said of the measure, that \"it was\r\nthe voice of Jacob, but the hand of Esau.\"] The two important points in\r\nwhich it differed from the measure of Mr. Fox were, in leaving the\r\nmanagement of their commercial concerns still in the hands of the\r\nCompany, and in making the Crown the virtual depositary of Indian\r\npatronage, [Footnote: \"Mr. Pitt's Bill continues the form of the\r\nCompany's government, and professes to leave the patronage under certain\r\nconditions, and the commerce without condition, in the hands of the\r\nCompany; but places all matters relating to the _civil_ and\r\n_military_ government and _revenues_ in the hands of six\r\nCommissioners, to be nominated and appointed by His Majesty, under the\r\ntitle of 'Commissioners of the Affairs of India,' which Board of\r\nCommissioners is invested with the 'superintendence and control over all\r\nthe British territorial possessions in the East Indies, and over the\r\naffairs of the United Company of Merchants trading thereto.'\"--\r\nComparative Statement of the Two Bills, read from his place by Mr.\r\nSheridan, on the Discussion of the Declaratory Acts in 1788, and\r\nafterwards published.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this statement he says, \"The present Board of Control\r\nhave, under Mr. Pitt's Bill, usurped those very imperial prerogatives\r\nfrom the Crown, which were falsely said to have been given to the new\r\nBoard of Directors under Mr. Fox's Bill.\"] instead of suffering it to be\r\ndiverted into the channels of the Whig interest,--never, perhaps, to\r\nfind its way back again. In which of these directions such an accession\r\nof power might, with least mischief to the Constitution, be bestowed,\r\nhaving the experience only of the use made of it on one side, we cannot,\r\nwith any certainty, pretend to determine. One obvious result of this\r\ntransfer of India to the Crown has been that smoothness so remarkable in\r\nthe movements of the system ever since--that easy and noiseless play of\r\nits machinery, which the lubricating contact of Influence alone could\r\ngive, and which was wholly unknown in Indian policy, till brought thus\r\nby Mr. Pitt under ministerial control. When we consider the stormy\r\ncourse of Eastern politics before that period--the inquiries, the\r\nexposures, the arraignments that took place--the constant hunt after\r\nIndian delinquency, in which Ministers joined no less keenly than the\r\nOpposition--and then compare all this with the tranquillity that has\r\nreigned, since the halcyon incubation of the Board of Control over the\r\nwaters,--though we may allow the full share that actual reform and a\r\nbetter system of government may claim in this change, there is still but\r\ntoo much of it to be attributed to causes of a less elevated nature,--to\r\nthe natural abatement of the watchfulness of the minister, over affairs\r\nno longer in the hands of others, and to that power of Influence, which,\r\nboth at home and abroad, is the great and ensuring bond of tranquillity,\r\nand, like the Chain of Silence, mentioned in old Irish poetry, binds all\r\nthat come within its reach in the same hushing spell of compromise and\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that, in the course of an altercation with Mr.\r\nRolle, the member for Devonshire, Mr. Sheridan took the opportunity of\r\ndisavowing any share in the political satires then circulating, under\r\nthe titles of \"The Rolliad\" and the \"Probationary Odes.\" \"He was aware,\"\r\nhe said, \"that the Honorable Gentlemen had suspected that he was either\r\nthe author of those compositions, or some way or other concerned in\r\nthem; but he assured them, upon his honor, he was not--nor had he ever\r\nseen a line of them till they were in print in the newspaper.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rolle, the hero of The Rolliad, was one of those unlucky persons,\r\nwhose destiny it is to be immortalized by ridicule, and to whom the\r\nworld owes the same sort of gratitude for the wit of which they were the\r\nbutts, as the merchants did, in Sinbad's story, to those pieces of meat\r\nto which diamonds adhered. The chief offence, besides his political\r\nobnoxiousness, by which he provoked this satirical warfare, (whose plan\r\nof attack was all arranged at a club held at Becket's,) was the lead\r\nwhich he took in a sort of conspiracy, formed on the ministerial\r\nbenches, to interrupt, by coughing, hawking, and other unseemly noises,\r\nthe speeches of Mr. Burke. The chief writers of these lively productions\r\nwere Tickell, General Fitzpatrick, [Footnote: To General Fitzpatrick\r\nsome of the happiest pleasantries are to be attributed; among others,\r\nthe verses on Brooke Watson, those on the Marquis of Graham, and \"The\r\nLiars.\"] Lord John [Footnote: Lord John Townshend, the only survivor, at\r\npresent, of this confederacy of wits, was the author, in conjunction\r\nwith Tickell, of the admirable Satire, entitled \"Jekyll,\"--Tickell\r\nhaving contributed only the lines parodied from Pope. To the exquisite\r\nhumor of Lord John we owe also the Probationary Ode for Major Scott, and\r\nthe playful parody on _\"Donae gratus eram libi.\"_] Townshend,\r\nRichardson, George Ellis, and Dr. Lawrence. [Footnote: By Doctor\r\nLawrence the somewhat ponderous irony of the prosaic department was\r\nchiefly managed. In allusion to the personal appearance of this eminent\r\ncivilian, one of the wits of the day thus parodied a passage of Virgil:\r\n\r\n      _\"Quo tetrior alter\r\n  Non fuit, excepto_ Laurentis _corpore Turni.\"_]\r\n\r\nThere were also a few minor contributions from the pens of Bate Dudley,\r\nMr. O'Beirne (afterwards Bishop of Meath), and Sheridan's friend, Read.\r\nIn two of the writers, Mr. Ellis and Dr. Lawrence, we have a proof of\r\nthe changeful nature of those atoms, whose concourse for the time\r\nconstitutes Party, and of the volatility with which, like the motes in\r\nthe sunbeam, described by Lucretius, they can\r\n\r\n  _\"Commutare viam, retroque repulsa reverti\r\n  Nunc huc, nunc illuc, in cunctas denique partes.\"_\r\n\r\n  Change their light course, as fickle chance may guide,\r\n  Now here, now there, and shoot from side to side.\r\n\r\nDr. Lawrence was afterwards a violent supporter of Mr. Pitt, and Mr.\r\nEllis [Footnote: It is related that, on one occasion, when Mr. Ellis was\r\ndining with Mr. Pitt, and embarrassed naturally by the recollection of\r\nwhat he had been guilty of towards his host in The Rolliad, some of his\r\nbrother-wits, to amuse themselves at his expense, endeavored to lead the\r\nconversation to the subject of this work, by asking him various\r\nquestions, as to its authors, &c.,--which Mr. Pitt overhearing, from the\r\nupper end of the table, leaned kindly towards Ellis and said,\r\n\r\n  _\"Immo age, et a prima, dic, hospes, originc nobis.\"_\r\n\r\nThe word \"hospes,\" applied to the new convert, was happy, and the\r\n\"_erroresque tuos_,\" that follows, was, perhaps, left to be\r\nimplied.] showed the versatility of his wit, as well as of his politics,\r\nby becoming one of the most brilliant contributors to The Antijacobin.\r\n\r\nThe Rolliad and The Antijacobin may, on their respective sides of the\r\nquestion, be considered as models of that style of political satire,\r\n[Footnote: The following just observations upon The Rolliad and\r\nProbationary Odes occur in the manuscript Life of Sheridan which I have\r\nalready cited:--\"They are, in most instances, specimens of the powers of\r\nmen, who, giving themselves up to ease and pleasure, neither improved\r\ntheir minds with great industry, nor exerted them with much activity;\r\nand have therefore left no very considerable nor durable memorials of\r\nthe happy and vigorous abilities with which nature had certainly endowed\r\nthem. The effusions themselves are full of fortunate allusions,\r\nludicrous terms, artful panegyric, and well-aimed satire. The verses are\r\nat times far superior to the occasion, and the whole is distinguished by\r\na taste, both in language and matter, perfectly pure and classical; but\r\nthey are mere occasional productions. They will sleep with the papers of\r\nthe Craftsman, so vaunted, in their own time, but which are never now\r\nraked up, except by the curiosity of the historian and the man of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\"Wit, being generally founded upon the manners and characters of its own\r\nday, is crowned in that day, beyond all other exertions of the mind,\r\nwith splendid and immediate success. But there is always something that\r\nequalizes. In return, more than any other production, it suffers\r\nsuddenly and irretrievably from the hand of Time. It receives a\r\ncharacter the most opposite to its own. From being the most generally\r\nunderstood and perceived, it becomes of all writing the most difficult\r\nand the most obscure. Satires, whose meaning was open to the multitude,\r\ndefy the erudition of the scholar, and comedies, of which every line was\r\nfelt as soon as it was spoken, require the labor of an antiquary to\r\nexplain them.\"] whose lightness and vivacity give it the appearance of\r\nproceeding rather from the wantonness of wit than of ill-nature, and\r\nwhose very malice, from the fancy with which it is mixed up, like\r\ncertain kinds of fireworks, explodes in sparkles. They, however, who are\r\nmost inclined to forgive, in consideration of its polish and\r\nplayfulness, the personality in which the writers of both these works\r\nindulged, will also readily admit that by no less shining powers can a\r\nlicense so questionable be either assumed or palliated, and that nothing\r\nbut the lively effervescence of the draught can make us forget the\r\nbitterness infused into it. At no time was this truth ever more\r\nstrikingly exemplified than at present, when a separation seems to have\r\ntaken place between satire and wit, which leaves the former like the\r\ntoad, _without_ the \"jewel in its head;\" and when the hands, into\r\nwhich the weapon of personality has chiefly fallen, have brought upon it\r\na stain and disrepute, that will long keep such writers as those of the\r\nRolliad and Antijacobin from touching it again.\r\n\r\nAmong other important questions, that occupied the attention of Mr.\r\nSheridan at this period, was the measure brought forward under the title\r\nof \"Irish Commercial Propositions\" for the purpose of regulating and\r\nfinally adjusting the commercial intercourse between England and\r\nIreland. The line taken by him and Mr. Fox in their opposition to this\r\nplan was such as to accord, at once with the prejudices of the English\r\nmanufacturers and the feelings of the Irish patriots,--the former\r\nregarding the measure as fatal to their interests, and the latter\r\nrejecting with indignation the boon which it offered, as coupled with a\r\ncondition for the surrender of the legislative independence of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn correct views of political economy, the advantage throughout this\r\ndiscussion was wholly on the side of the minister; and, in a speech of\r\nMr. Jenkinson, we find (advanced, indeed, but incidentally, and treated\r\nby Mr. Fox as no more than amusing theories,) some of those liberal\r\nprinciples of trade which have since been more fully developed, and by\r\nwhich the views of all practical statesmen are, at the present day,\r\ndirected. The little interest attached by Mr. Fox to the science of\r\nPolitical Economy--so remarkably proved by the fact of his never having\r\nread the work of Adam Smith on the subject--is, in some degree,\r\naccounted for by the skepticism of the following passage, which occurs\r\nin one of his animated speeches on this very question. Mr. Pitt having\r\nasserted, in answer to those who feared the competition of Ireland in\r\nthe market from her low prices of labor, that \"great capital would in\r\nall cases overbalance cheapness of labor,\" Mr. Fox questions the\r\nabstract truth of this position, and adds,--\"General positions of all\r\nkinds ought to be very cautiously admitted; indeed, on subjects so\r\ninfinitely complex and mutable as politics and commerce, a wise man\r\nhesitates at giving too implicit a credit to any general maxim of any\r\ndenomination.\"\r\n\r\nIf the surrender of any part of her legislative power could have been\r\nexpected from Ireland in that proud moment, when her new-born\r\nIndependence was but just beginning to smile in her lap, the acceptance\r\nof the terms then proffered by the Minister, might have averted much of\r\nthe evils, of which she was afterwards the victim. The proposed plan\r\nbeing, in itself, (as Mr. Grattan called it,) \"an incipient and creeping\r\nUnion,\" would have prepared the way less violently for the completion of\r\nthat fated measure, and spared at least the corruption and the blood\r\nwhich were the preliminaries of its perpetration at last. But the pride,\r\nso natural and honorable to the Irish--had fate but placed them in a\r\nsituation to assert it with any permanent effect--repelled the idea of\r\nbeing bound even by the commercial regulations of England. The wonderful\r\neloquence of Grattan, which, like an eagle guarding her young, rose\r\ngrandly in defence of the freedom to which itself had given birth, would\r\nalone have been sufficient to determine a whole nation to his will.\r\nAccordingly such demonstrations of resistance were made both by people\r\nand parliament, that the Commercial Propositions were given up by the\r\nminister, and this apparition of a Union withdrawn from the eyes of\r\nIreland for the present--merely to come again, in another shape, with\r\nmany a \"mortal murder on its crown, and push her from her stool.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sheridan took a strong interest in this question, and spoke at\r\nsome length on every occasion when it was brought before the House, I\r\nwill, in order to enable the reader to judge of his manner of treating\r\nit, give a few passages from his speech on the discussion of that\r\nResolution, which stipulated for England a control over the external\r\nlegislation of Ireland:--\r\n\r\n\"Upon this view, it would be an imposition on common sense to pretend\r\nthat Ireland could in future have the exercise of free will or\r\ndiscretion upon any of those subjects of legislation, on which she now\r\nstipulated to follow the edicts of Great Britain; and it was a miserable\r\nsophistry to contend, that her being permitted the ceremony of placing\r\nthose laws upon her own Statute-Book, as a form of promulgating them,\r\nwas an argument that it was not the British but the Irish statutes that\r\nbound the people of Ireland. For his part, if he were a member of the\r\nIrish Parliament, he should prefer the measure of enacting by one\r\ndecisive vote, that all British laws to the purposes stipulated, should\r\nhave immediate operation in Ireland as in Great Britain; choosing rather\r\nto avoid the mockery of enacting without deliberation, and deciding\r\nwhere they had no power to dissent. Where fetters were to be worn, it\r\nwas a wretched ambition to contend for the distinction of fastening our\r\nown shackles.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"All had been delusion, trick, and fallacy: a new scheme of commercial\r\narrangement is proposed to the Irish as a boon; and the surrender of\r\ntheir Constitution is tacked to it as a mercantile regulation. Ireland,\r\nnewly escaped from harsh trammels and severe discipline, is treated like\r\na high-mettled horse, hard to catch; and the Irish Secretary is to\r\nreturn to the field, soothing and coaxing him, with a sieve of provender\r\nin one hand, but with a bridle in the other, ready to slip over his head\r\nwhile he is snuffling at the food. But this political jockeyship, he was\r\nconvinced, would not succeed.\"\r\n\r\nIn defending the policy, as well as generosity of the concessions made\r\nto Ireland by Mr. Fox in 1782, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately for the peace and future union of the two kingdoms, no such\r\nmiserable and narrow policy entered into the mind of his Right Honorable\r\nfriend; he disdained the injustice of bargaining with Ireland on such a\r\nsubject; nor would Ireland have listened to him if he had attempted it.\r\nShe had not applied to purchase a Constitution; and if a tribute or\r\ncontribution had been demanded in return for what was then granted,\r\nthose patriotic spirits who were at that time leading the oppressed\r\npeople of that insulted country to the attainment of their just rights,\r\nwould have pointed to other modes of acquiring them; would have called\r\nto them in the words of Camillas, _arma aptare atque ferro non auro\r\npatriam et libertatem recuperare_.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passage is a curious proof of the short-sighted views\r\nwhich prevailed at that period, even among the shrewdest men, on the\r\nsubject of trade:--\r\n\r\n\"There was one point, however, in which he most completely agreed with\r\nthe manufacturers of this country; namely, in their assertion, that if\r\nthe Irish trader should be enabled to meet the British merchant and\r\nmanufacturer in the British market, the gain of Ireland must be the loss\r\nof England. [Footnote: Mr. Fox also said, \"Ireland cannot make a single\r\nacquisition but to the proportionate loss of England.\"] This was a fact\r\nnot to be controverted on any principle of common sense or reasonable\r\nargument. The pomp of general declamation and waste of fine words, which\r\nhad on so many occasions been employed to disguise and perplex this\r\nplain simple truth, or still more fallaciously to endeavor to prove that\r\nGreat Britain would find her balance in the Irish market, had only\r\ntended to show the weakness and inconsistency of the doctrine they were\r\nmeant to support. The truth of the argument was with the manufacturers;\r\nand this formed, in Mr. Sheridan's mind, a ground of one of the most\r\nvehement objections he had to the present plan.\"\r\n\r\nIt was upon the clamor, raised at this time by the English\r\nmanufacturers, at the prospect of the privileges about to be granted to\r\nthe trade of Ireland, that Tickell, whose wit was always on the watch\r\nfor such opportunities, wrote the following fragment, found among the\r\npapers of Mr. Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n\"A VISION.\r\n\r\n\"After supping on a few Colchester oysters and a small Welsh rabbit, I\r\nwent to bed last Tuesday night at a quarter before eleven o'clock. I\r\nslept quietly for near two hours, at the expiration of which period, my\r\nslumber was indeed greatly disturbed by the oddest train of images I\r\never experienced. I thought that every individual article of my usual\r\ndress and furniture was suddenly gifted with the powers of speech, and\r\nall at once united to assail me with clamorous reproaches, for my\r\nunpardonable neglect of their common interests, in the great question of\r\nsurrendering our British commerce to Ireland. My hat, my coat, and every\r\nbutton on it, my Manchester waistcoat, my silk breeches, my Birmingham\r\nbuckles, my shirt-buttons, my shoes, my stockings, my garters, and what\r\nwas more troublesome, my night-cap, all joined in a dissonant volley of\r\npetitions and remonstrances--which, as I found it impossible to wholly\r\nsuppress, I thought it most prudent to moderate, by soliciting them to\r\ncommunicate their ideas individually. It was with some difficulty they\r\nconsented to even this proposal, which they considered as a device to\r\nextinguish their general ardor, and to break the force of their united\r\nefforts; nor would they by any means accede to it, till I had repeatedly\r\nassured them, that as soon as I heard them separately, I would appoint\r\nan early hour for receiving them in a joint body. Accordingly, having\r\nfixed these preliminaries, my Night-cap thought proper to slip up\r\nimmediately over my ears, and disengaging itself from my temples, called\r\nupon my Waistcoat, who was rather carelessly reclining on a chair, to\r\nattend him immediately at the foot of the bed. My Sheets and Pillow-\r\ncases, being all of Irish extraction, stuck close to me, however,--which\r\nwas uncommonly fortunate, for, not only my Curtains had drawn off to the\r\nfoot of the bed, but my Blankets also had the audacity to associate\r\nthemselves with others of the woollen fraternity, at the first outset of\r\nthis household meeting. Both my Towels attended as evidences at the\r\nbar,--but my Pocket-handkerchief, notwithstanding his uncommon\r\nforwardness to hold forth the banner of sedition, was thought to be a\r\ncharacter of so mixed a complexion, as rendered it more decent for him\r\nto reserve his interference till my Snuff-box could be heard--which was\r\nsettled accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"At length, to my inconceivable astonishment, my Night-cap, attended as\r\nI have mentioned, addressed me in the following terms:--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly as was the age at which Sheridan had been transplanted from\r\nIreland--never to set foot upon his native land again--the feeling of\r\nnationality remained with him warmly through life, and he was, to the\r\nlast, both fond and proud of his country. The zeal, with which he\r\nentered, at this period, into Irish politics, may be judged of from some\r\nletters, addressed to him in the year 1785, by Mr. Isaac Corry, who was\r\nat that time a member of the Irish Opposition, and combated the\r\nCommercial Propositions as vigorously as he afterwards, when Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, defended their \"consummate flower,\" the Union. A few\r\nextracts from these letters will give some idea of the interest attached\r\nto this question by the popular party in both countries.\r\n\r\nThe following, dated August 5, 1785, was written during the adjournment\r\nof ten days, that preceded Mr. Orde's introduction of the Propositions:--\r\n\r\n\"Your most welcome letter, after hunting me some days through the\r\ncountry, has at length reached me. I wish you had sent some notes of\r\nyour most excellent speech; but such as we have must be given to the\r\npublic--admirable commentary upon Mr. Pitt's _Apology to the People of\r\nIreland_, which must also be published in the manner fitting it. The\r\naddresses were sent round to all the towns in the kingdom, in order to\r\ngive currency to the _humbug_. Being upon the spot, I have my\r\ntroops in perfect order, and am ready at a moment's warning for any\r\nmanoeuvre which may, when we meet in Dublin previous to the next\r\nsitting, be thought necessary to follow the petitions for postponing.\r\n\r\n\"We hear astonishing accounts of _your_ greatness in particular.\r\nPaddy will, I suppose, some _beau jour_ be voting you another\r\n50,000, [Footnote: Alluding to the recent vote of that sum to Mr.\r\nGrattan.] if you go on as you have done.\r\n\r\n\"I send to-day down to my friend, O'Neil, who waits for a signal only,\r\nand we shall go up together. Brownlow is just beside me, and I shall\r\nride over this morning to get him up to consultation in town.... we must\r\nget our Whig friends in England to engraft a few slips of Whiggism here\r\n--till that is done, there will be neither Constitution for the people\r\nnor stability for the Government.\r\n\r\n\"Charlemont and I were of opinion that we should not make the volunteers\r\nspeak upon the present business; so I left it out in the Resolutions at\r\nour late review. They are as tractable as we could desire, and we can\r\nmanage them completely. We inculcate all moderation--were we to slacken\r\nin that, they would instantly step forward.\"\r\n\r\nThe date of the following letter is August 10th--two days before Mr.\r\nOrde brought forward the Propositions.\r\n\r\n\"We have got the bill entire, sent about by Orde. The more it is read,\r\nthe less it is liked. I made notable use of the clause you sent me\r\nbefore the whole arrived. We had a select meeting to-day of the D. of\r\nLeinster, Charlemont, Conolly, Grattan, Forbes, and myself. We think of\r\nmoving an address to postpone to-morrow till the 15th of January, and\r\nhave also some resolutions ready _pro re nata_, as we don't yet\r\nknow what shape they will put the business into;--Conolly to move. To-\r\nmorrow morning we settle the Address and Resolutions, and after that,\r\nto-morrow, meet more at large at Leinster House. All our troops muster\r\npretty well. Mountmorris is here, and to be with us to-morrow morning.\r\nWe reckon on something like a hundred, and some are sanguine enough to\r\nadd near a score above it--that is too much. The report of to-night is\r\nthat Orde is not yet ready for us, and will beg a respite of a few days\r\n--Beresford is not yet arrived, and that is said to be the cause.\r\nMornington and Poole are come--their muster is as strict as ours. If we\r\ndivide any thing like a hundred, they will not dare to take a victory\r\nover us. Adieu, yours most truly,\r\n\r\n\"I. C.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion for bringing in the Bill was carried only by a majority of\r\nnineteen, which is thus announced to Mr. Sheridan by his correspondent:--\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate with you on 108 minority-against 127. The business never\r\ncan go on. They were astonished, and looked the sorriest devils you can\r\nimagine. Orde's exhibition was pitiful indeed--the support of his party\r\nweak and open to attack--the debate on their part really poor. On ours,\r\nConolly, O'Neill, and the other country gentlemen, strong and of great\r\nweight--Grattan able and eloquent in an uncommon degree--every body in\r\nhigh spirits, and altogether a force that was irresistible. We divided\r\nat nine this morning, on leave to bring in a Bill for the settlement.\r\nThe ground fought upon was the Fourth Resolution, and the principle of\r\nthat in the others. The commercial detail did not belong accurately to\r\nthe debate, though some went over it in a cursory way. Grattan, two\r\nhours and a half--Flood as much--the former brilliant, well attended to,\r\nand much admired--the latter tedious from detail; of course, not so\r\nwell heard, and answered by Foster in detail, to refutation.\r\n\r\n\"The Attorney General defended the constitutional safety under the\r\nFourth-Resolution principle. Orde mentioned the Opposition in England\r\ntwice in his opening speech, with imputations, or insinuations at least,\r\nnot very favorable. You were not left undefended. Forbes exerted his\r\nwarm attachment to you with great effect--Burgh, the flag-ship of the\r\nLeinster squadron, gave a well-supported fire pointed against Pitt, and\r\ncovering you. Hardy (the Bishop of Down's friend) in a very elegant\r\nspeech gave you due honor; and I had the satisfaction of a slight\r\nskirmish, which called up the Attorney General, &c....\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August Mr. Orde withdrew his Bill, and Mr. Corry writes--\r\n\"I wish you joy a thousand times of our complete victory. Orde has\r\noffered the Bill--moved its being printed for his own justification to\r\nthe country, and no more of it this session. We have the effects of a\r\ncomplete victory.\"\r\n\r\nAnother question of much less importance, but more calculated to call\r\nforth Sheridan's various powers, was the Plan of the Duke of Richmond\r\nfor the fortification of dock-yards, which Mr. Pitt brought forward (it\r\nwas said, with much reluctance) in the session of 1786, and which\r\nSheridan must have felt the greater pleasure in attacking, from the\r\nrenegade conduct of its noble author in politics. In speaking of the\r\nReport of a Board of General Officers, which had been appointed to\r\nexamine into the merits of this plan, and of which the Duke himself was\r\nPresident, he thus ingeniously plays with the terms of the act in\r\nquestion, and fires off his wit, as it were, _en ricochet_, making\r\nit bound lightly from sentence to sentence:--\r\n\r\n\"Yet the Noble Duke deserved the warmest panegyrics for the striking\r\nproofs he had given of his genius as an engineer; which appeared even in\r\nthe planning and construction of the paper in his hand! The professional\r\nability of the Master-general shone as conspicuously there, as it could\r\nupon our coasts. He had made it an argument of posts; and conducted his\r\nreasoning upon principles of trigonometry, as well as logic. There were\r\ncertain detached data, like advanced works, to keep the enemy at a\r\ndistance from the main object in debate. Strong provisions covered the\r\nflanks of his assertions. His very queries were in casements. No\r\nimpression, therefore, was to be made on this fortress of sophistry by\r\ndesultory observations; and it was necessary to sit down before it, and\r\nassail it by regular approaches. It was fortunate, however, to observe,\r\nthat notwithstanding all the skill employed by the noble and literary\r\nengineer, his mode of defence on paper was open to the same objection\r\nwhich had been urged against his other fortifications; that if his\r\nadversary got possession of one of his posts, it became strength against\r\nhim, and the means of subduing the whole line of his argument.\"\r\n\r\nHe also spoke at considerable length, upon the Plan brought forward by\r\nMr. Pitt for the Redemption of the National Debt--that grand object of\r\nthe calculator and the financier, and equally likely, it should seem, to\r\nbe attained by the dreams of the one as by the experiments of the other.\r\nMr. Pitt himself seemed to dread the suspicion of such a partnership, by\r\nthe care with which he avoided any acknowledgment to Dr. Price, whom he\r\nhad nevertheless personally consulted on the subject, and upon whose\r\nvisions of compound interest this fabric of finance was founded.\r\n\r\nIn opening the Plan of his new Sinking Fund to the House, Mr. Pitt, it\r\nis well known, pronounced it to be \"a firm column, upon which he was\r\nproud to flatter himself his name might be inscribed.\" Tycho Brahe would\r\nhave said the same of his Astronomy, and Des Cartes of his Physics;--but\r\nthese baseless columns have long passed away, and the Plan of paying\r\ndebt with borrowed money well deserves to follow them. The delusion,\r\nindeed, of which this Fund was made the instrument, during the war with\r\nFrance, is now pretty generally acknowledged; and the only question is,\r\nwhether Mr. Pitt was so much the dupe of his own juggle, as to persuade\r\nhimself that thus playing with a debt, from one hand to the other, was\r\npaying it--or whether, aware of the inefficacy of his Plan for any other\r\npurpose than that of keeping up a blind confidence in the money-market,\r\nhe yet gravely went on, as a sort of High Priest of Finance, profiting\r\nby a miracle in which he did not himself believe, and, in addition to\r\nthe responsibility of the uses to which he applied the money, incurring\r\nthat of the fiscal imposture by which he raised it.\r\n\r\nThough, from the prosperous state of the revenue at the time of the\r\ninstitution of this Fund, the absurdity was not yet committed of\r\nborrowing money to maintain it, we may perceive by the following acute\r\npleasantry of Mr. Sheridan, (who denied the existence of the alleged\r\nsurplus of income,) that he already had a keen insight into the fallacy\r\nof that Plan of Redemption afterwards followed:--\"At present,\" he said,\r\n\"it was clear there was no surplus; and the only means which suggested\r\nthemselves to him were, a loan of a million for the especial purpose--\r\nfor the Right Honorable gentleman might say, with the person in the\r\ncomedy, '_If you won't lend me the money, how can I pay you?_'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCHARGES AGAINST MR. HASTINGS.--COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH FRANCE.--DEBTS OF\r\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe calm security into which Mr. Pitt's administration had settled,\r\nafter the victory which the Tory alliance of King and people had gained\r\nfor him, left but little to excite the activity of party spirit, or to\r\ncall forth those grand explosions of eloquence, which a more electric\r\nstate of the political world produces. The orators of Opposition might\r\nsoon have been reduced, like Philoetetes wasting his arrows upon geese\r\nat Lemnos, [Footnote: _\"Pinnigero, non armigero in corpore tela\r\nexerceantur.\"--Accius, ap. Ciceron._ lib. vii. ep. 33.] to expend the\r\narmory of their wit upon the Grahams and Rolles of the Treasury bench.\r\nBut a subject now presented itself--the Impeachment of Warren Hastings--\r\nwhich, by embodying the cause of a whole country in one individual, and\r\nthus combining the extent and grandeur of a national question, with the\r\ndirect aim and singleness of a personal attack, opened as wide a field\r\nfor display as the most versatile talents could require, and to Mr.\r\nSheridan, in particular, afforded one of those precious opportunities,\r\nof which, if Fortune but rarely offers them to genius, it is genius\r\nalone that can fully and triumphantly avail itself.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise and progress of British power in India--of that\r\nstrange and rapid vicissitude, by which the ancient Empire of the Moguls\r\nwas transferred into the hands of a Company of Merchants in Leadenhall\r\nStreet--furnishes matter perhaps more than any other that could be\r\nmentioned, for those strong contrasts and startling associations, to\r\nwhich eloquence and wit often owe their most striking effects. The\r\ndescendants of a Throne, once the loftiest in the world, reduced to\r\nstipulate with the servants of traders for subsistence--the dethronement\r\nof Princes converted into a commercial transaction, and a ledger-account\r\nkept of the profits of Revolutions--the sanctity of Zenanus violated by\r\nsearch-warrants, and the chicaneries of English Law transplanted, in\r\ntheir most mischievous luxuriance, into the holy and peaceful shades of\r\nthe Bramins,--such events as these, in which the poetry and the prose of\r\nlife, its pompous illusions and mean realities, are mingled up so sadly\r\nand fantastically together, were of a nature, particularly when recent,\r\nto lay hold of the imagination as well as the feelings, and to furnish\r\neloquence with those strong lights and shadows, of which her most\r\nanimated pictures are composed.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful, therefore, that the warm fancy of Mr. Burke should\r\nhave been early and strongly excited by the scenes of which India was\r\nthe theatre, or that they should have (to use his own words) \"constantly\r\npreyed upon his peace, and by night and day dwelt on his imagination.\"\r\nHis imagination, indeed,--as will naturally happen, where this faculty\r\nis restrained by a sense of truth--was always most livelily called into\r\nplay by events of which he had not himself been a witness; and,\r\naccordingly, the sufferings of India and the horrors of revolutionary\r\nFrance were the two subjects upon which it has most unrestrainedly\r\nindulged itself. In the year 1780 he had been a member of the Select\r\nCommittee, which was appointed by the House of Commons to take the\r\naffairs of India into consideration, and through some of whose luminous\r\nReports we trace that powerful intellect, which \"stamped an image of\r\nitself\" on every subject that it embraced. Though the reign of Clive had\r\nbeen sufficiently fertile in enormities, and the treachery practised\r\ntowards Ornichund seemed hardly to admit of any parallel, yet the\r\nloftier and more prominent iniquities of Mr. Hastings's government were\r\nsupposed to have thrown even these into shadow. Against him, therefore,\r\n--now rendered a still nobler object of attack by the haughty spirit with\r\nwhich he defied his accusers,--the whole studies and energies of Mr.\r\nBurke's mind were directed.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that to the impetuous zeal, with which\r\nBurke at this period rushed into Indian politics, and to that ascendancy\r\nover his party by which he so often compelled them to \"swell with their\r\ntributary urns his flood,\" the ill-fated East India Bill of Mr. Fox in a\r\nconsiderable degree owed its origin. In truth, the disposition and\r\ntalents of this extraordinary man made him at least as dangerous as\r\nuseful to any party with which he connected himself. Liable as he was to\r\nbe hurried into unsafe extremes, impatient of contradiction, and with a\r\nsort of _feudal_ turn of mind, which exacted the unconditional\r\nservice of his followers, it required, even at that time, but little\r\npenetration to foresee the violent schism that ensued some years after,\r\nor to pronounce that, whenever he should be unable to command his party,\r\nhe would desert it.\r\n\r\nThe materials which he had been collecting on the subject of India, and\r\nthe indignation with which these details of delinquency had filled him,\r\nat length burst forth (like that mighty cloud, described by himself as\r\n\"pouring its whole contents over the plains of the Carnatic\") in his\r\nwonderful speech on the Nabob of Arcot's debts [Footnote: Isocrates, in\r\nhis Encomium upon Helen, dwells much on the advantage to an orator of\r\nspeaking upon subjects from which but little eloquence is expected--\r\n[Greek: pezi ton phaulon chai tapeinon]. There is little doubt, indeed,\r\nthat _surprise_ must have considerable share in the pleasure, which\r\nwe derive from eloquence on such unpromising topics as have inspired\r\nthree of the most masterly speeches that can be selected from modern\r\noratory--that of Burke on the Nabob of Arcot's debts--of Grattan on\r\nTithes, and of Mr. Fox on the Westminster Scrutiny.]--a speech, whose\r\nonly rivals perhaps in all the records of oratory, are to be found among\r\nthree or four others of his own, which, like those poems of Petrarch\r\ncalled _Sorelle_ from their kindred excellence, may be regarded as\r\nsisters in beauty, and equalled only by each other.\r\n\r\nThough the charges against Mr. Hastings had long been threatened, it was\r\nnot till the present year that Mr. Burke brought them formally forward.\r\nHe had been, indeed, defied to this issue by the friends of the\r\nGovernor-General, whose reliance, however, upon the sympathy and support\r\nof the ministry (accorded, as a matter of course, to most State\r\ndelinquents) was, in this instance, contrary to all calculation,\r\ndisappointed. Mr. Pitt, at the commencement of the proceedings, had\r\nshown strong indications of an intention to take the cause of the\r\nGovernor-General under his protection. Mr. Dundas, too, had exhibited\r\none of those convenient changes of opinion, by which such statesmen can\r\naccommodate themselves to the passing hue of the Treasury-bench, as\r\nnaturally as the Eastern insect does to the color of the leaf on which\r\nit feeds. Though one of the earliest and most active denouncers of\r\nIndian mis-government, and even the mover of those strong Resolutions in\r\n1782 [Footnote: In introducing the Resolutions he said, that \"he was\r\nurged to take this step by an account, which had lately arrived from\r\nIndia, of an act of the most flagrant violence and oppression and of the\r\ngrossest breach of faith, committed by Mr. Hastings against Cheyte Sing,\r\nthe Raja of Benares.\"] on which some of the chief charges of the present\r\nprosecution were founded, he now, throughout the whole of the opening\r\nscenes of the Impeachment, did not scruple to stand forth as the warm\r\neulogist of Mr. Hastings, and to endeavor by a display of the successes\r\nof his administration to dazzle away attention from its violence and\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nThis tone, however, did not long continue:--in the midst of the\r\nanticipated triumph of Mr. Hastings, the Minister suddenly \"changed his\r\nhand, and checked his pride.\" On the occasion of the Benares Charge,\r\nbrought forward in the House of Commons by Mr. Fox, a majority was, for\r\nthe first time, thrown into the scale of the accusation; and the abuse\r\nthat was in consequence showered upon Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, through\r\nevery channel of the press, by the friends of Mr. Hastings, showed how\r\nwholly unexpected, as well as mortifying, was the desertion.\r\n\r\nAs but little credit was allowed to conviction in this change, it being\r\ndifficult to believe that a Minister should come to the discussion of\r\nsuch a question, so lightly ballasted with opinions of his own as to be\r\nthrown from his equilibrium by the first wave of argument he\r\nencountered,--various statements and conjectures were, at the time,\r\nbrought forward to account for it. Jealousy of the great and increasing\r\ninfluence of Mr. Hastings at court was, in general, the motive assigned\r\nfor the conduct of the Minister. It was even believed that a wish\r\nexpressed by the King, to have his new favorite appointed President of\r\nthe Board of Control, was what decided Mr. Pitt to extinguish, by\r\ncooperating with the Opposition, every chance of a rivalry, which might\r\nprove troublesome, if not dangerous, to his power. There is no doubt\r\nthat the arraigned ruler of India was honored at this period with the\r\ndistinguished notice of the Court--partly, perhaps, from admiration of\r\nhis proficiency in that mode of governing, to which all Courts are, more\r\nor less, instinctively inclined, and partly from a strong distaste to\r\nthose who were his accusers, which would have been sufficient to\r\nrecommend any person or measure to which they were opposed.\r\n\r\nBut whether Mr. Pitt, in the part which he now took, was actuated merely\r\nby personal motives, or (as his eulogists represent) by a strong sense\r\nof impartiality and justice, he must at all events have considered the\r\nwhole proceeding, at this moment, as a most seasonable diversion of the\r\nattacks of the Opposition, from his own person and government to an\r\nobject so little connected with either. The many restless and powerful\r\nspirits now opposed to him would soon have found, or made, some vent for\r\ntheir energies, more likely to endanger the stability of his power;--\r\nand, as an expedient for drawing off some of that perilous lightning,\r\nwhich flashed around him from the lips of a Burke, a Fox, and a\r\nSheridan, the prosecution of a great criminal like Mr. Hastings\r\nfurnished as efficient a conductor as could be desired.\r\n\r\nStill, however, notwithstanding the accession of the Minister, and the\r\nimpulse given by the majorities which he commanded, the projected\r\nimpeachment was but tardy and feeble in its movements, and neither the\r\nHouse nor the public went cordially along with it. Great talents, united\r\nto great power--even when, as in the instance of Mr. Hastings, abused--\r\nis a combination before which men are inclined to bow implicitly. The\r\niniquities, too, of Indian rulers were of that gigantic kind, which\r\nseemed to outgrow censure, and even, in some degree, challenge\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, Mr. Hastings had been successful; and success\r\nbut too often throws a charm round injustice, like the dazzle of the\r\nnecromancer's shield in Ariosto, before which every one falls\r\n\r\n  _\"Con gli occhi abbacinati, e senza mente.\"_\r\n\r\nThe feelings, therefore, of the public were, at the outset of the\r\nprosecution, rather for than against the supposed delinquent. Nor was\r\nthis tendency counteracted by any very partial leaning towards his\r\naccusers. Mr. Fox had hardly yet recovered his defeat on the India Bill,\r\nor--what had been still more fatal to him--his victory in the Coalition.\r\nMr. Burke, in spite of his great talents and zeal, was by no means\r\npopular. There was a tone of dictatorship in his public demeanor against\r\nwhich men naturally rebelled; and the impetuosity and passion with which\r\nhe flung himself into every favorite subject, showed a want of self-\r\ngovernment but little calculated to inspire respect. Even his eloquence,\r\nvarious and splendid as it was, failed in general to win or command the\r\nattention of his hearers, and, in this great essential of public\r\nspeaking, must be considered inferior to that ordinary, but practical,\r\nkind of oratory, [Footnote: \"Whoever, upon comparison, is deemed by a\r\ncommon audience the greatest orator, ought most certainly to be\r\npronounced such by men of science and erudition.\"--_Hume_, Essay\r\n13.] which reaps its harvest at the moment of delivery, and is\r\nafterwards remembered less for itself than its effects. There was a\r\nsomething--which those who have but read him can with difficulty\r\nconceive--that marred the impression of his most sublime and glowing\r\ndisplays. In vain did his genius put forth its superb plumage,\r\nglittering all over with the hundred eyes of fancy--the gait of the bird\r\nwas heavy and awkward, and its voice seemed rather to scare than\r\nattract. Accordingly, many of those masterly discourses, which, in their\r\npresent form, may proudly challenge comparison with all the written\r\neloquence upon record, were, at the time when they were pronounced,\r\neither coldly listened to, or only welcomed as a signal and excuse for\r\nnot listening at all. To such a length was this indifference carried,\r\nthat, on the evening when he delivered his great Speech on the Nabob of\r\nArcot's debts, so faint was the impression it produced upon the House,\r\nthat Mr. Pitt and Lord Grenville, as I have heard, not only consulted\r\nwith each other as to whether it was necessary they should take the\r\ntrouble of answering it, but decided in the negative. Yet doubtless, at\r\nthe present moment, if Lord Grenville--master as he is of all the\r\nknowledge that belongs to a statesman and a scholar--were asked to\r\npoint out from the stores of his reading the few models of oratorical\r\ncomposition, to the perusal of which he could most frequently, and with\r\nunwearied admiration, return, this slighted and unanswered speech would\r\nbe among the number.\r\n\r\nFrom all these combining circumstances it arose that the prosecution of\r\nMr. Hastings, even after the accession of the Minister, excited but a\r\nslight and wavering interest; and, without some extraordinary appeal to\r\nthe sympathies of the House and the country--some startling touch to the\r\nchord of public feeling--it was questionable whether the inquiry would\r\nnot end as abortively as all the other Indian inquests [Footnote:\r\nNamely, the fruitless prosecution of Lord Clive by General Burgoyne, the\r\ntrifling verdict upon the persons who had imprisoned Lord Pigot, and the\r\nBill of Pains and Penalties against Sir Thomas Rumbold, finally\r\nwithdrawn.] that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nIn this state of the proceeding, Mr. Sheridan brought forward, on the\r\n7th of February, in the House of Commons, the charge relative to the\r\nBegum Princesses of Oude, and delivered that celebrated Speech, whose\r\neffect upon its hearers has no parallel in the annals of ancient or\r\nmodern eloquence. [Footnote: Mr. Burke declared it to be \"the most\r\nastonishing effort of eloquence, argument, and wit united, of which\r\nthere was any record or tradition.\" Mr. Fox said, \"All that he had ever\r\nheard, all that he had ever read, when compared with it, dwindled into\r\nnothing, and vanished like vapor before the sun,\"--and Mr. Pitt\r\nacknowledged \"that it surpassed all the eloquence of ancient and modern\r\ntimes, and possessed every thing that genius or art could furnish, to\r\nagitate and control the human mind.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several other tributes, of a less distinguished kind, of\r\nwhich I find the following account in the Annual Register--\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Dolben immediately moved an adjournment of the debate,\r\nconfessing, that, in the state of mind in which Mr. Sheridan's speech\r\nhad left him, it was impossible for him to give a determinate opinion.\r\nMr. Stanhope seconded the motion. When he had entered the House, he was\r\nnot ashamed to acknowledge, that his opinion inclined to the side of Mr.\r\nHastings. But such had been the wonderful efficacy of Mr. Sheridan's\r\nconvincing detail of facts, and irresistible eloquence, that he could\r\nnot but say that his sentiments were materially changed. Nothing,\r\nindeed, but information almost equal to a miracle, could determine him\r\nnot to vote for the Charge; but he had just felt the influence of such a\r\nmiracle, and he could not but ardently desire to avoid an immediate\r\ndecision. Mr. Mathew Montague confessed, that he had felt a similar\r\nrevolution of sentiment.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect the men by whom the House of Commons was at that day\r\nadorned, and the conflict of high passions and interests in which they\r\nhad been so lately engaged;--when we see them all, of all parties,\r\nbrought (as Mr. Pitt expressed it) \"under the wand of the enchanter,\"\r\nand only vying with each other in their description of the fascination\r\nby which they were bound;--when we call to mind, too, that he, whom the\r\nfirst statesmen of the age thus lauded, had but lately descended among\r\nthem from a more aerial region of intellect, bringing trophies falsely\r\nsupposed to be incompatible with political prowess;--it is impossible to\r\nimagine a moment of more entire and intoxicating triumph. The only alloy\r\nthat could mingle with such complete success must be the fear that it\r\nwas too perfect ever to come again;--that his fame had then reached the\r\nmeridian point, and from that consummate moment must date its decline.\r\n\r\nOf this remarkable Speech there exists no Report;--for it would be\r\nabsurd to dignify with that appellation the meagre and lifeless sketch,\r\nthe\r\n\r\n  _Tenuem sine viribus umbram\r\n  In faciem aenae,_\r\n\r\nwhich is given in the Annual Registers and Parliamentary Debates. Its\r\nfame, therefore, remains like an empty shrine--a cenotaph still crowned\r\nand honored, though the inmate is wanting. Mr. Sheridan was frequently\r\nurged to furnish a Report himself, and from his habit of preparing and\r\nwriting out his speeches, there is little doubt that he could have\r\naccomplished such a task without much difficulty. But, whether from\r\nindolence or design, he contented himself with leaving to imagination,\r\nwhich, in most cases, he knew, transcends reality, the task of\r\njustifying his eulogists, and perpetuating the tradition of their\r\npraise. Nor, in doing thus, did he act perhaps unwisely for his fame. We\r\nmay now indulge in dreams of the eloquence that could produce such\r\neffects, [Footnote: The following anecdote is given as a proof of the\r\nirresistible power of this speech in a note upon Mr. Bisset's History of\r\nthe Reign of George III.:--\r\n\r\n\"The late Mr. Logan, well known for his literary efforts, and author of\r\na most masterly defence of Mr. Hastings, went that day to the House of\r\nCommons, prepossessed for the accused and against his accuser. At the\r\nexpiration of the first hour he said to a friend, 'All this is\r\ndeclamatory assertion without proof:'--when the second was finished,\r\n'This is a most wonderful oration:'--at the close of the third, 'Mr.\r\nHastings has acted very unjustifiably:'--the fourth, 'Mr. Hastings is a\r\nmost atrocious criminal;'--and, at last, 'Of all monsters of iniquity\r\nthe most enormous is Warren Hastings!'\"] as we do of the music of the\r\nancients and the miraculous powers attributed to it, with as little risk\r\nof having our fancies chilled by the perusal of the one, as there is of\r\nour faith being disenchanted by hearing a single strain of the other.\r\n\r\nAfter saying thus much, it may seem a sort of wilful profanation, to\r\nturn to the spiritless abstract of this speech, which is to be found in\r\nall the professed reports of Parliamentary oratory, and which stands,\r\nlike one of those half-clothed mummies in the Sicilian vaults, with,\r\nhere and there, a fragment of rhetorical drapery, to give an appearance\r\nof life to its marrowless frame. There is, however, one passage so\r\nstrongly marked with the characteristics of Mr. Sheridan's talent--of\r\nhis vigorous use of the edge of the blade, with his too frequent display\r\nof the glitter of the point--that it may be looked upon as a pretty\r\nfaithful representation of what he spoke, and claim a place among the\r\nauthentic specimens of his oratory. Adverting to some of those admirers\r\nof Mr. Hastings, who were not so implicit in their partiality as to give\r\nunqualified applause to his crimes, but found an excuse for their\r\natrocity in the greatness of his mind, he thus proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"To estimate the solidity of such a defence, it would be sufficient\r\nmerely to consider in what consisted this prepossessing distinction,\r\nthis captivating characteristic of greatness of mind. Is it not solely\r\nto be traced in great actions directed to great ends? In them, and them\r\nalone, we are to search for true estimable magnanimity. To them only can\r\nwe justly affix the splendid title and honors of real greatness. There\r\nwas indeed another species of greatness, which displayed itself in\r\nboldly conceiving a bad measure, and undauntedly pursuing it to its\r\naccomplishment. But had Mr. Hastings the merit of exhibiting either of\r\nthese descriptions of greatness,--even of the latter? He saw nothing\r\ngreat--nothing magnanimous--nothing open--nothing direct in his\r\nmeasures, or in his mind. On the contrary, he had too often pursued the\r\nworst objects by the worst means. His course was an eternal deviation\r\nfrom rectitude. He either tyrannized or deceived; and was by turns a\r\nDionysius and a Scapin. [Footnote: The spirit of this observation has\r\nbeen well condensed in the compound name given by the Abbe de Pradt to\r\nNapoleon--\"Jupiter Scapin.\"] As well might the writhing obliquity of the\r\nserpent be compared to the swift directness of the arrow, as the\r\nduplicity of Mr. Hastings's ambition to the simple steadiness of genuine\r\nmagnanimity. In his mind all was shuffling, ambiguous, dark, insidious,\r\nand little: nothing simple, nothing unmixed: all affected plainness, and\r\nactual dissimulation; a heterogeneous mass of contradictory qualities;\r\nwith nothing great but his crimes; and even those contrasted by the\r\nlittleness of his motives, which at once denoted both his baseness and\r\nhis meanness, and marked him for a traitor and a trickster. Nay, in his\r\nstyle and writing there was the same mixture of vicious contrarieties;--\r\nthe most grovelling ideas were conveyed in the most inflated language,\r\ngiving mock consequence to low cavils, and uttering quibbles in heroics;\r\nso that his compositions disgusted the mind's taste, as much as his\r\nactions excited the soul's abhorrence. Indeed this mixture of character\r\nseemed, by some unaccountable but inherent quality, to be appropriated,\r\nthough in inferior degrees, to everything that concerned his employers.\r\nHe remembered to have heard an honorable and learned gentleman (Mr.\r\nDundas) remark, that there was something in the first frame and\r\nconstitution of the Company, which extended the sordid principles of\r\ntheir origin over all their successive operations; connecting with their\r\ncivil policy, and even with their boldest achievements, the meanness of\r\na pedlar and the profligacy of pirates. Alike in the political and the\r\nmilitary line could be observed _auctioneering ambassadors_ and\r\n_trading generals_;--and thus we saw a revolution brought about by\r\n_affidavits_; an army employed in _executing an arrest_; a\r\ntown besieged on _a note of hand_; a prince dethroned for the\r\n_balance of an account_. Thus it was they exhibited a government,\r\nwhich united the mock majesty of a bloody sceptre, and the little\r\n_traffic of a merchant's counting-house_, wielding a truncheon with\r\none hand, and _picking a pocket with the other_.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this speech, added to the line taken by the Minister,\r\nturned the balance against Hastings, and decided the Impeachment.\r\n\r\nCongratulations on his success poured in upon Mr. Sheridan, as may be\r\nsupposed, from all quarters; and the letters that he received from his\r\nown family on the occasion were preserved by him carefully and fondly\r\nthrough life. The following extract from one written by Charles Sheridan\r\nis highly honorable to both brothers:--\r\n\r\n\"Dublin Castle, 13th February, 1787.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR DICK,\r\n\r\n\"Could I for a moment forget you were my brother, I should, merely as an\r\nIrishman, think myself bound to thank you, for the high credit you have\r\ndone your country. You may be assured, therefore, that the sense of\r\nnational pride, which I in common with all your countrymen on this side\r\nof the water must feel on this splendid occasion, acquires no small\r\nincrease of personal satisfaction, when I reflect to whom Ireland is\r\nindebted, for a display of ability so unequalled, that the honor derived\r\nfrom it seems too extensive to be concentred in an individual, but ought\r\nto give, and I am persuaded will give, a new respect for the name of\r\nIrishman. I have heard and read the accounts of your speech, and of the\r\nastonishing impression it made, with tears of exultation--but what will\r\nflatter you more--I can solemnly declare it to be a fact, that I have,\r\nsince the news reached us, seen good honest _Irish_ pride, national\r\npride I mean, bring tears into the eyes of many persons, on this\r\noccasion, who never saw you. I need not, after what I have stated,\r\nassure you, that it is with the most heartfelt satisfaction that I offer\r\nyou my warmest congratulations....\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from his eldest sister, Mrs. Joseph Lefanu:--\r\n\r\n\"16th February, 1787.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n\"The day before yesterday I received the account of your glorious\r\nspeech. Mr. Crauford was so good as to write a more particular and\r\nsatisfactory one to Mr. Lefanu than we could have received from the\r\npapers. I have watched the first interval of ease from a cruel and\r\nalmost incessant headache to give vent to my feelings, and tell you how\r\nmuch I rejoice in your success. May it be entire! May the God who\r\nfashioned you, and gave you powers to sway the hearts of men and control\r\ntheir wayward wills, be equally favorable to you in all your\r\nundertakings, and make your reward here and hereafter! Amen, from the\r\nbottom of my soul! My affection for you has been ever 'passing the love\r\nof women.' Adverse circumstances have deprived me of the pleasure of\r\nyour society, but have had no effect in weakening my regard for you. I\r\nknow your heart too well to suppose that regard is indifferent to you,\r\nand soothingly sweet to me is the idea that in some pause of thought\r\nfrom the important matters that occupy your mind, your earliest friend\r\nis sometimes recollected by you.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are much above the little vanity that seeks its\r\ngratification in the praises of the million, but you must be pleased\r\nwith the applause of the discerning,--with the tribute I may say of\r\naffection paid to the goodness of your heart. People love your character\r\nas much as they admire your talents. My father is, in a degree that I\r\ndid not expect, gratified with the general attention you have excited\r\nhere: he seems truly pleased that men should say, 'There goes the father\r\nof Gaul.' If your fame has shed a ray of brightness over all so\r\ndistinguished as to be connected with you, I am sure I may say it has\r\ninfused a ray of gladness into my heart, deprest as it has been with ill\r\nhealth and long confinement....\"\r\n\r\nThere is also another letter from this lady, of the same date, to Mrs.\r\nSheridan, which begins thus enthusiastically:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SHERI.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but death could keep me silent on such an occasion as this. I\r\nwish you joy--I am sure you feel it: 'oh moments worth whole ages past,\r\nand all that are to come.' You may laugh at my enthusiasm if you please\r\n--I glory in it....\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of April following, Mr. Sheridan opened the Seventh Charge,\r\nwhich accused Hastings of corruption, in receiving bribes and presents.\r\nThe orator was here again lucky in having a branch of the case allotted\r\nto him, which, though by no means so susceptible of the ornaments of\r\neloquence as the former, had the advantage of being equally borne out by\r\ntestimony, and formed one of the most decided features of the cause. The\r\navidity, indeed, with which Hastings exacted presents, and then\r\nconcealed them as long as there was a chance of his being able to\r\nappropriate them to himself, gave a mean and ordinary air to iniquities,\r\nwhose magnitude would otherwise have rendered them imposing, if not\r\ngrand.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances, under which the present from Cheyte Sing was extorted\r\nshall be related when I come to speak of the great Speech in Westminster\r\nHall. The other strong cases of corruption, on which Mr. Sheridan now\r\ndwelt, were the sums given by the Munny Begum (in return for her\r\nappointment to a trust for which, it appears, she was unfit), both to\r\nHastings himself and his useful agent, Middleton. This charge, as far as\r\nregards the latter, was never denied--and the suspicious lengths to\r\nwhich the Governor-general went, in not only refusing all inquiry into\r\nhis own share of the transaction, but having his accuser, Nuncomar,\r\nsilenced by an unjust sentence of death, render his acquittal on this\r\ncharge such a stretch of charity, as nothing but a total ignorance of\r\nthe evidence and all its bearings can justify.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, with which Sheridan wound up his Speech on this\r\noccasion, is as strong an example as can be adduced of that worst sort\r\nof florid style, which prolongs metaphor into allegory, and, instead of\r\ngiving in a single sentence the essence of many flowers, spreads the\r\nflowers themselves, in crude heaps, over a whole paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion (he observed), that, although within this rank, but\r\ninfinitely too fruitful wilderness of iniquities--within this dismal and\r\nunhallowed labyrinth--it was most natural to cast an eye of indignation\r\nand concern over the wide and towering forest of enormities--all rising\r\nin the dusky magnificence of guilt; and to fix the dreadfully excited\r\nattention upon the huge trunks of revenge, rapine, tyranny, and\r\noppression; yet it became not less necessary to trace out the poisonous\r\nweeds, the baleful brushwood, and all the little, creeping, deadly\r\nplants, which were, in quantity and extent, if possible, more noxious.\r\nThe whole range of this far-spreading calamity was sown in the hot-bed\r\nof corruption; and had risen, by rapid and mature growth, into every\r\nspecies of illegal and atrocious violence.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the proceedings against Hastings, an occurrence,\r\nimmediately connected with them, had brought Sheridan and his early\r\nfriend Halhed together, under circumstances as different as well can be\r\nimagined from those under which they had parted as boys. The distance,\r\nindeed, that had separated them in the interval was hardly greater than\r\nthe divergence that had taken place in their pursuits; for, while\r\nSheridan had been converted into a senator and statesman, the lively\r\nHalhed had become an East Indian Judge, and a learned commentator on the\r\nGentoo Laws. Upon the subject, too, on which they now met, their views\r\nand interests were wholly opposite,--Sheridan being the accuser of\r\nHastings, and Halhed his friend. The following are the public\r\ncircumstances that led to their interview.\r\n\r\nIn one of the earliest debates on the Charges against the Governor-\r\ngeneral, Major Scott having asserted that, when Mr. Fox was preparing\r\nhis India Bill, overtures of accommodation had been made, by his\r\nauthority, to Mr. Hastings, added, that he (Major Scott) \"entertained no\r\ndoubt that, had Mr. Hastings then come home, he would have heard nothing\r\nof all this calumny, and all these serious accusations.\" Mr. Fox, whom\r\nthis charge evidently took by surprise, replied that he was wholly\r\nignorant of any such overtures, and that \"whoever made, or even hinted\r\nat such an offer, as coming from him, did it without the smallest shadow\r\nof authority.\" By an explanation, a few days after, from Mr. Sheridan,\r\nit appeared that he was the person who had taken the step alluded to by\r\nMajor Scott. His interference, however, he said, was solely founded upon\r\nan opinion which he had himself formed with respect to the India Bill,--\r\nnamely, that it would be wiser, on grounds of expediency, not to make it\r\nretrospective in any of its clauses. In consequence of this opinion, he\r\nhad certainly commissioned a friend to inquire of Major Scott, whether,\r\nif Mr. Hastings were recalled, he would come home;--but \"that there had\r\nbeen the most distant idea of bartering with Mr. Hastings for his\r\nsupport of the Indian Bill, he utterly denied.\" In conclusion, he\r\nreferred, for the truth of what he had now stated, to Major Scott, who\r\ninstantly rising, acknowledged that, from inquiries which he had since\r\nmade of the gentleman deputed to him by Mr. Sheridan on the occasion, he\r\nwas ready to bear testimony to the fairness of the statement just\r\nsubmitted to the House, and to admit his own mistake in the\r\ninterpretation which he had put on the transaction.\r\n\r\nIt was in relation to this misunderstanding that the interview took\r\nplace in the year 1786 between Sheridan and Halhed--the other persons\r\npresent being Major Scott and Doctor Parr, from whom I heard the\r\ncircumstance. The feelings of this venerable scholar towards \"iste\r\nScotus\" (as he calls Major Scott in his Preface to Bellendenus) were\r\nnot, it is well known, of the most favorable kind; and he took the\r\nopportunity of this interview to tell that gentleman fully what he\r\nthought of him:--\"for ten minutes,\" said the Doctor, in describing his\r\naggression, \"I poured out upon him hot, scalding abuse--'twas lava,\r\nSir!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other questions that occupied the attention of Mr. Sheridan\r\nduring this session, the most important were the Commercial Treaty with\r\nFrance, and the Debts of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe same erroneous views by which the opposition to the Irish Commercial\r\nPropositions was directed, still continued to actuate Mr. Fox and his\r\nfriends in their pertinacious resistance to the Treaty with France;--a\r\nmeasure which reflects high honor upon the memory of Mr. Pitt, as one of\r\nthe first efforts of a sound and liberal policy to break through that\r\nsystem of restriction and interference, which had so long embarrassed\r\nthe flow of international commerce.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of leaving trade to find its own way into those channels\r\nwhich the reciprocity of wants established among mankind opens to it, is\r\none of those obvious truths that have lain long on the highways of\r\nknowledge, before practical statesmen would condescend to pick them up.\r\nIt has been shown, indeed, that the sound principles of commerce which\r\nhave at last forced their way from the pages of thinking men into the\r\ncouncils of legislators, were more than a hundred years since\r\npromulgated by Sir Dudley North; [Footnote: McCulloch's Lectures on\r\nPolitical Economy]--and in the Querist of Bishop Berkeley may be found\r\nthe outlines of all that the best friends not only of free trade but of\r\nfree religion would recommend to the rulers of Ireland at the present\r\nday. Thus frequently does Truth, before the drowsy world is prepared for\r\nher, like\r\n\r\n  \"The nice Morn on the Indian steep,\r\n  From her cabin'd loophole peep.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Sheridan spoke frequently in the course of the discussions,\r\nhe does not appear to have, at any time, encountered the main body of\r\nthe question, but to have confined himself chiefly to a consideration of\r\nthe effects which the treaty would have upon the interests of Ireland;--\r\na point which he urged with so much earnestness, as to draw down upon\r\nhim from one of the speakers the taunting designation of \"Self-appointed\r\nRepresentative of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox was the most active antagonist of the Treaty; and his speeches\r\non the subject may be counted among those feats of prowess, with which\r\nthe chivalry of Genius sometimes adorns the cause of Error. In founding,\r\nas he did, his chief argument against commercial intercourse upon the\r\n\"natural enmity\" between the two countries, he might have referred, it\r\nis true, to high Whig authority:--\"The late Lord Oxford told me,\" says\r\nLord Bolingbroke, \"that my Lord Somers being pressed, I know not on what\r\noccasion or by whom, on the unnecessary and ruinous continuation of the\r\nwar, instead of giving reasons to show the necessity of it, contented\r\nhimself to reply that he had been bred up in a hatred to France.\"--But\r\nno authority, however high, can promote a prejudice into a reason, or\r\nconciliate any respect for this sort of vague, traditional hostility,\r\nwhich is often obliged to seek its own justification in the very\r\nmischiefs which itself produces. If Mr. Fox ever happened to peruse the\r\npraises, which his _Antigallican_ sentiments on this occasion\r\nprocured for him, from the tedious biographer of his rival, Mr. Gifford,\r\nhe would have suspected, like Phocion, that he must have spoken\r\nsomething unworthy of himself, to have drawn down upon his head a\r\npanegyric from such a quarter.\r\n\r\nAnother of Mr. Fox's arguments against entering into commercial\r\nrelations with France, was the danger lest English merchants, by\r\ninvesting their capital in foreign speculations, should become so\r\nentangled with the interests of another country as to render them less\r\njealous than they ought to be of the honor of their own, and less ready\r\nto rise in its defence, when wronged or insulted. But, assuredly, a want\r\nof pugnacity is not the evil to be dreaded among nations--still less\r\nbetween two, whom the orator had just represented as inspired by a\r\n\"natural enmity\" against each other. He ought rather, upon this\r\nassumption, to have welcomed the prospect of a connection, which, by\r\ntransfusing and blending their commercial interests, and giving each a\r\nstake in the prosperity of the other, would not only soften away the\r\nanimal antipathy attributed to them, but, by enlisting selfishness on\r\nthe side of peace and amity, afford the best guarantee against wanton\r\nwarfare, that the wisdom of statesmen or philosophers has yet devised.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in affecting to consider the question in an enlarged point of\r\nview, fell equally short of its real dimensions; and even descended to\r\nthe weakness of ridiculing such commercial arrangements, as unworthy\r\naltogether of the contemplation of the higher order of statesmen. \"The\r\nRight Honorable gentleman,\" he said, \"had talked of the treaty as if it\r\nwere the affair of two little counting-houses, and not of two great\r\ncountries. He seemed to consider it as a contention between the sign of\r\nthe Fleur-de-lis, and the sign of the Red Lion, which house should\r\nobtain the best custom. Such paltry considerations were below his\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\nIn such terms could Burke, from temper or waywardness of judgment,\r\nattempt to depreciate a speech which may be said to have contained the\r\nfirst luminous statement of the principles of commerce, with the most\r\njudicious views of their application to details, that had ever, at that\r\nperiod, been presented to the House.\r\n\r\nThe wise and enlightened opinions of Mr. Pitt, both with respect to\r\ntrade, and another very different subject of legislation, Religion,\r\nwould have been far more worthy of the imitation of some of his self-\r\nstyled followers, than those errors which they are so glad to shelter\r\nunder the sanction of his name. For encroachments upon the property and\r\nliberty of the subject, for financial waste and unconstitutional\r\nseverity, they have the precedent of their great master ever ready on\r\ntheir lips. But, in all that would require wisdom and liberality in his\r\ncopyists--in the repugnance he felt to restrictions and exclusions,\r\naffecting either the worldly commerce of man with man, or the spiritual\r\nintercourse of man with his God,--in all this, like the Indian that\r\nquarrels with his idol, these pretended followers not only dissent from\r\ntheir prototype themselves, but violently denounce, as mischievous, his\r\nopinions when adopted by others.\r\n\r\nIn attributing to party feelings the wrong views entertained by the\r\nOpposition on this question, we should but defend their sagacity at the\r\nexpense of their candor; and the cordiality, indeed, with which they\r\ncame forward this year to praise the spirited part taken by the Minister\r\nin the affairs of Holland--even allowing that it would be difficult for\r\nWhigs not to concur in a measure so national--sufficiently acquits them\r\nof any such perverse spirit of party, as would, for the mere sake of\r\nopposition, go wrong because the Minister was right. To the sincerity of\r\none of their objections to the Treaty--namely, that it was a design, on\r\nthe part of France, to detach England, by the temptation of a mercantile\r\nadvantage, from her ancient alliance with Holland and her other\r\ncontinental connections--Mr. Burke bore testimony, as far as himself was\r\nconcerned, by repeating the same opinions, after an interval of ten\r\nyears, in his testamentary work, the \"Letters on a Regicide Peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe other important question which I have mentioned as engaging, during\r\nthe session of 1787, the attention of Mr. Sheridan, was the application\r\nto Parliament for the payment of the Prince of Wales's debts. The\r\nembarrassments of the Heir Apparent were but a natural consequence of\r\nhis situation; and a little more graciousness and promptitude on the\r\npart of the King, in interposing to relieve His Royal Highness from the\r\ndifficulties under which he labored, would have afforded a chance of\r\ndetaching him from his new political associates, of which, however the\r\naffection of the Royal parent may have slumbered, it is strange that his\r\nsagacity did not hasten to avail itself. A contrary system, however, was\r\nadopted. The haughty indifference both of the monarch and his minister\r\nthrew the Prince entirely on the sympathy of the Opposition. Mr. Pitt\r\nidentified himself with the obstinacy of the father, while Mr. Fox and\r\nthe Opposition committed themselves with the irregularities of the son;\r\nand the proceedings of both parties were such as might have been\r\nexpected from their respective connections--the Royal mark was but too\r\nvisible upon each.\r\n\r\nOne evil consequence, that was on the point of resulting from the\r\nembarrassed situation in which the Prince now found himself, was his\r\nacceptance of a loan which the Duke of Orleans had proffered him, and\r\nwhich would have had the perilous tendency of placing the future\r\nSovereign of England in a state of dependence, as creditor, on a Prince\r\nof France. That the negotiations in this extraordinary transaction had\r\nproceeded farther than is generally supposed, will appear from the\r\nfollowing letters of the Duke of Portland to Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n\"Sunday noon, 13 Dec.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"Since I saw you I have received a confirmation of the intelligence\r\nwhich was the subject of our conversation. The particulars varied in no\r\nrespect from those I related to you--except in the addition of a\r\npension, which is to take place immediately on the event which entitles\r\nthe creditors to payment, and is to be granted for life to a nominee of\r\nthe D. of O----s. The loan was mentioned in a mixed company by two of\r\nthe Frenchwomen and a Frenchman (none of whose names I know) in\r\n_Calonne's_ presence, who interrupted them, by asking, how they\r\ncame to know any thing of the matter, then set them right in two or\r\nthree particulars which they had misstated, and afterwards begged them,\r\nfor God's sake, not to talk of it, because it might be their complete\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Bulstrode--but will return at a moment's notice, if I can\r\nbe of the least use in getting rid of this odious engagement, or\r\npreventing its being entered into, if it should not be yet completed.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"P.\"\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I think myself much obliged to you for what you have done. I hope I am\r\nnot too sanguine in looking to a good conclusion of this bad business. I\r\nwill certainly be in town by two o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"P.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bulstrode, Monday, 14. Dec.\r\n\r\n\"9 A. M.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan, who was now high in the confidence of the Prince, had\r\ntwice, in the course of the year 1786, taken occasion to allude publicly\r\nto the embarrassments of His Royal Highness. Indeed, the decisive\r\nmeasure which this Illustrious Person himself had adopted, in reducing\r\nhis establishment and devoting a part of his income to the discharge of\r\nhis debts, sufficiently proclaimed the true state of affairs to the\r\npublic. Still, however, the strange policy was persevered in, of adding\r\nthe discontent of the Heir-Apparent to the other weapons in the hands of\r\nthe Opposition;--and, as might be expected, they were not tardy in\r\nturning it to account. In the spring of 1787, the embarrassed state of\r\nHis Royal Highness's affairs was brought formally under the notice of\r\nparliament by Alderman Newenham.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the discussions to which the subject gave rise, Mr. Rolle,\r\nthe member for Devonshire, a strong adherent of the ministry, in\r\ndeprecating the question about to be agitated, affirmed that \"it went\r\nimmediately to affect our Constitution in Church and State.\" In these\r\nsolemn words it was well understood, that he alluded to a report at that\r\ntime generally believed, and, indeed, acted upon by many in the\r\netiquette of private life, that a marriage had been solemnized between\r\nthe Prince of Wales and Mrs. Fitzherbert--a lady of the Roman Catholic\r\npersuasion, who, with more danger to her own peace than to that of\r\neither Church or State, had for some time been the distinguished object\r\nof His Royal Highness's affection.\r\n\r\nEven had an alliance of this description taken place, the provisions of\r\nthe Royal Marriage Act would have nullified it into a mere ceremony,\r\ninefficient, as it was supposed, for any other purpose than that of\r\nsatisfying the scruples of one of the parties. But that dread of Popery,\r\nwhich in England starts at its own shadow, took alarm at the\r\nconsequences of an intercourse so heterodox; and it became necessary, in\r\nthe opinion of the Prince and his friends, to put an end to the\r\napprehensions that were abroad on the subject.\r\n\r\nNor can it be denied that, in the minds of those who believed that the\r\nmarriage had been actually solemnized, [Footnote: Home Tooke, in his\r\ninsidious pamphlet on the subject, presumed so far on this belief as to\r\ncall Mrs. Fitzherbert \"Her Royal Highness.\"] there were, in one point of\r\nview, very sufficient grounds of alarm. By the Statute of William and\r\nMary, commonly called the Bill of Rights, it is enacted, among other\r\ncauses of exclusion from the throne, that \"every person who shall marry\r\na Papist shall be excluded and for ever be incapable to inherit the\r\ncrown of this realm.\"--In such cases (adds this truly revolutionary Act)\r\n\"the people of these realms shall be and are hereby absolved of their\r\nallegiance.\" Under this Act, which was confirmed by the Act of\r\nSettlement, it is evident that the Heir-Apparent would, by such a\r\nmarriage as was now attributed to him, have forfeited his right of\r\nsuccession to the throne. From so serious a penalty, however, it was\r\ngenerally supposed, he would have been exempted by the operation of the\r\nRoyal Marriage Act (12 George III.), which rendered null and void any\r\nmarriage contracted by any descendant of George II. without the previous\r\nconsent of the King, or a twelve months' notice given to the Privy\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThat this Act would have nullified the alleged marriage of the Prince of\r\nWales there is, of course, no doubt;--but that it would also have\r\nexempted him from the forfeiture incurred by marriage with a Papist, is\r\na point which, in the minds of many, still remains a question. There\r\nare, it is well known, analogous cases in Law, where the nullity of an\r\nillegal transaction does not do away the penalty attached to it.\r\n[Footnote: Thus, a man, by contracting a second marriage, pending the\r\nfirst marriage, commits a felony; and the crime, according to its legal\r\ndescription, consists in marrying, or contracting a marriage--though\r\nwhat he does is no more a marriage than that of the Heir-Apparent would\r\nbe under the circumstances in question.\r\n\r\nThe same principle, it appears, runs through the whole Law of Entails\r\nboth in England and Scotland, and a variety of cases might be cited, in\r\nwhich, though the act done is void, yet the doing of it creates a\r\nforfeiture.] To persons, therefore, who believed that the actual\r\nsolemnization of the marriage could be proved by witnesses present at\r\nthe ceremony, this view of the case, which seemed to promise an\r\ninterruption of the Succession, could not fail to suggest some\r\ndisquieting apprehensions and speculations, which nothing short, it was\r\nthought, of a public and authentic disavowal of the marriage altogether\r\nwould be able effectually to allay.\r\n\r\nIf in politics Princes are unsafe allies, in connections of a tenderer\r\nnature they are still more perilous partners; and a triumph over a Royal\r\nlover is dearly bought by the various risks and humiliations which\r\naccompany it. Not only is a lower standard of constancy applied to\r\npersons of that rank, but when once love-affairs are converted into\r\nmatters of state, there is an end to all the delicacy and mystery that\r\nought to encircle them. The disavowal of a Royal marriage in the Gazette\r\nwould have been no novelty in English history; [Footnote: See, in\r\nEllis's Letters of History, vol. iii. the declarations of Charles II.\r\nwith respect to his marriage with \"one Mrs. Walters,\" signed by himself\r\nand published in the London Gazette.] and the disclaimer, on the present\r\noccasion, though intrusted to a less official medium, was equally\r\npublic, strong, and unceremonious.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox, who had not been present in the House of Commons when the\r\nmember for Devonshire alluded to the circumstance, took occasion, on the\r\nnext discussion of the question, and, as he declared, with the immediate\r\nauthority of the Prince, to contradict the report of the marriage in the\r\nfullest and most unqualified terms:--it was, he said, \"a miserable\r\ncalumny, a low malicious falsehood, which had been propagated without\r\ndoors, and made the wanton sport of the vulgar;--a tale, fit only to\r\nimpose upon the lowest orders, a monstrous invention, a report of a fact\r\nwhich had not the smallest degree of foundation, actually impossible to\r\nhave happened.\" To an observation from Mr. Rolle that \"they all knew\r\nthere was an act of Parliament which forbade such a marriage; but that,\r\nthough it could not be done under the formal sanction of the law, there\r\nwere ways in which it might have taken place, and in which that law, in\r\nthe minds of some persons, might have been satisfactorily evaded,\"--Mr.\r\nFox replied, that--\"he did not deny the calumny in question merely with\r\nregard to certain existing laws, but that he denied it _in toto_,\r\nin point of fact as well as of law:--it not only never could have\r\nhappened legally, but it never did happen in any way whatsoever, and had\r\nfrom the beginning been a base and malicious falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Rolle, from either obstinacy or real distrust, refused, in\r\nspite of the repeated calls of Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Grey, to declare\r\nhimself satisfied with this declaration, it was felt by the minister to\r\nbe at least sufficiently explicit and decisive, to leave him no further\r\npretext in the eyes of the public, for refusing the relief which the\r\nsituation of the Prince required. Accordingly a message from the Crown\r\non the subject of His Royal Highness's debts was followed by an addition\r\nto his income of L10,000 yearly out of the Civil List; an issue of\r\nL161,000 from the same source, for the discharge of his debts, and\r\nL20,000 on account of the works at Carlton House.\r\n\r\nIn the same proportion that this authorized declaration was successful\r\nin satisfying the public mind, it must naturally have been painful and\r\nhumiliating to the person whose honor was involved in it. The immediate\r\nconsequence of this feeling was a breach between that person and Mr.\r\nFox, which, notwithstanding the continuance, for so many years after, of\r\nthe attachment of both to the same illustrious object, remained, it is\r\nunderstood, unreconciled to the last.\r\n\r\nIf, in the first movement of sympathy with the pain excited in that\r\nquarter, a retractation of this public disavowal was thought of, the\r\nimpossibility of finding any creditable medium through which to convey\r\nit, must soon have suggested itself to check the intention. Some middle\r\ncourse, however, it was thought, might be adopted, which, without going\r\nthe full length of retracting, might tend at least to unsettle the\r\nimpression left upon the public, and, in some degree, retrieve that loss\r\nof station, which a disclaimer, coming in such an authentic shape, had\r\nentailed. To ask Mr. Fox to discredit his own statement was impossible.\r\nAn application was, therefore, made to a young member of the party, who\r\nwas then fast rising into the eminence which he has since so nobly\r\nsustained, and whose answer to the proposal is said to have betrayed\r\nsome of that unaccommodating highmindedness, which, in more than one\r\ncollision with Royalty, has proved him but an unfit adjunct to a Court.\r\nThe reply to his refusal was, \"Then I must get Sheridan to say\r\nsomething;\"--and hence, it seems, was the origin of those few\r\ndexterously unmeaning compliments, with which the latter, when the\r\nmotion of Alderman Newenham was withdrawn, endeavored, without in the\r\nleast degree weakening the declaration of Mr. Fox, to restore that\r\nequilibrium of temper and self-esteem, which such a sacrifice of\r\ngallantry to expediency had naturally disturbed. In alluding to the\r\noffer of the Prince, through Mr. Fox, to answer any questions upon the\r\nsubject of his reported marriage, which it might be thought proper to\r\nput to him in the House, Mr. Sheridan said,--\"That no such idea had been\r\npursued, and no such inquiry had been adopted, was a point which did\r\ncredit to the decorum, the feelings, and the dignity of Parliament. But\r\nwhilst His Royal Highness's feelings had no doubt been considered on\r\nthis occasion, he must take the liberty of saying, however some might\r\nthink it a subordinate consideration, that there was another person\r\nentitled, in every delicate and honorable mind, to the same attention;\r\none, whom he would not otherwise venture to describe or allude to, but\r\nby saying it was a name, which malice or ignorance alone could attempt\r\nto injure, and whose character and conduct claimed and were entitled to\r\nthe truest respect.\"\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
