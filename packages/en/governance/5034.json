I shall submit to you\r\nthe reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these\r\nsubjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the\r\nthoughtful attention of your committees and of all Members of the Congress\r\nwho may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as\r\nconstituting the very substance of the business of the Government, makes\r\ncomment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many\r\nhappy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of\r\ncommunity of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled\r\npeace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the nations\r\nmanifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the\r\nprocesses of peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far\r\nthe United States has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, I\r\nearnestly hope and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sincere\r\nadherence to the cause of international friendship by ratifying the several\r\ntreaties of arbitration awaiting renewal by the Senate. In addition to\r\nthese, it has been the privilege of the Department of State to gain the\r\nassent, in principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing four-fifths\r\nof the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it\r\nshall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy arise\r\nwhich can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall\r\nbe publicly analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by\r\nthe parties before either nation determines its course of action.\r\n\r\nThere is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies\r\nbetween the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of\r\nthese two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the\r\nworld. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the\r\nestablishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those\r\nalready assumed.\r\n\r\nThere is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south\r\nof us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in\r\nAmerica until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico;\r\nuntil it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended\r\ngovernments will not be countenanced or dealt with by-the Government of the\r\nUnited States. We are the friends of constitutional government in America;\r\nwe are more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way\r\ncan our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our\r\nfriendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has\r\nno Government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken\r\ndown, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more\r\nthan the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation\r\nof Victoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of\r\nconstitutional President, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal\r\nright and declared himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition of\r\naffairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the\r\nmost elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the\r\ncitizens of other countries resident within her territory can long be\r\nsuccessfully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long continued, to\r\nimperil the interests of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands\r\nimmediately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his\r\npurposes, in despite of the constitution of the Republic and the rights of\r\nits people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful\r\npower, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventual\r\ndownfall would have left the country in a more deplorable condition than\r\never. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the moral\r\nsupport even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed.\r\nLittle by little he has been completely isolated. By a little every day his\r\npower and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall\r\nnot, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And\r\nthen, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order\r\nrestored in distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her\r\nleaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions.\r\n\r\nI turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under consideration\r\na bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency, for which the\r\ncountry waits with impatience, as for something fundamental to its whole\r\nbusiness life and necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and\r\nartificial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early\r\nenactment into law. I take leave to beg that the whole energy and attention\r\nof the Senate be concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully\r\ndisposed of. And yet I feel that the request is not needed-that the Members\r\nof that great House need no urging in this service to the country.\r\n\r\nI present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity that special provision\r\nbe made also for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers of the\r\ncountry. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It\r\nputs them upon an equal footing with other business men and masters of\r\nenterprise, as it should; and upon its passage they will find themselves\r\nquit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of\r\ncredit. The farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special\r\nprivilege, such as extending to them the credit of the Government itself.\r\nWhat they need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own\r\nabundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for\r\njoint, concerted local action in their own behalf in getting the capital\r\nthey must use. It is to this we should now address ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the industry\r\nof our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its\r\ndevelopment. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the\r\nNation is the production of its food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be\r\nconcentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry, upon the cries of\r\nthe crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but it is from the\r\nquiet interspaces of the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw\r\nthe sources of life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from\r\nthe forest and the mine. Without these every street would be silent, every\r\noffice deserted, every factory fallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer\r\ndoes not stand upon the same footing with the forester and the miner in the\r\nmarket of credit. He is the servant of the seasons. Nature determines how\r\nlong he must wait for his crops, and will not be hurried in her processes.\r\nHe may give his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the\r\nseason when his crop matures, lies at the gates of the market where his\r\nproducts are sold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in\r\nthe broker's office or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the\r\nbanker.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department of the Government is seeking to assist as never\r\nbefore to make farming an efficient business, of wide co-operative effort,\r\nin quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the\r\nGovernment will henceforth work together as real partners in this field,\r\nwhere we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelligent\r\nplans are already being put into execution. The Treasury of the United\r\nStates has, by a timely and well-considered distribution of its deposits,\r\nfacilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the\r\nscarcity of available funds too often experienced at such times. But we\r\nmust not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary expedients. We must\r\nadd the means by which the, farmer may make his credit constantly and\r\neasily available and command when he will the capital by which to support\r\nand expand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the\r\nmodern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been\r\nstudied and developed on the other side of the water while we left our\r\nfarmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market. You have but\r\nto look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and\r\nembarrassment which have been put upon those who produce our food.\r\n\r\nConscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the Congress\r\nrecently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the\r\nvarious systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in\r\nEurope, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought\r\nto make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to\r\nour own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the Senate and\r\nHouse will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful\r\nresults, and I believe that the studies and recently formed plans of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture may be made to serve them very greatly in their\r\nwork of framing appropriate and adequate legislation. It would be\r\nindiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to dogmatize upon so great and\r\nmany-sided a question, but I feel confident that common counsel will\r\nproduce the results we must all desire.\r\n\r\nTurn from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city and\r\nin the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree that\r\nthe immediate service we owe the business communities of the country is to\r\nprevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented. I\r\nthink it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti-trust\r\nlaw stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but\r\nthat we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground\r\nby further and more explicit legislation; and should also supplement that\r\ngreat act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate\r\nits administration and make it fairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall\r\nall wish, and the country will expect, this to be the central subject of\r\nour deliberations during the present session; but it is a subject so\r\nmany-sided and so deserving of careful and discriminating discussion that I\r\nshall take the liberty of addressing you upon it in a special message at a\r\nlater date than this. It is of capital importance that the business men of\r\nthis country should be relieved of all uncertainties of law with regard to\r\ntheir enterprises and investments and a clear path indicated which they can\r\ntravel without anxiety. It is as important that they should be relieved of\r\nembarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should be\r\ndestroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open.\r\n\r\nI turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without\r\nserious controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees\r\nfor the Presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not\r\nmisinterpret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the\r\nprompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections\r\nthroughout the country at which the voters of the several parties may\r\nchoose their nominees for the Presidency without the intervention of\r\nnominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation\r\nshould provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the\r\npurpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and\r\nformulating the platforms of the parties; and I suggest that these\r\nconventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this single purpose,\r\nbut of the nominees for Congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the\r\nSenate of the United States, the Senators whose terms have not yet closed,\r\nthe national committees, and the candidates for the Presidency themselves,\r\nin order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people\r\nfor carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\nThese are all matters of vital domestic concern, and besides them, outside\r\nthe charmed circle of our own national life in which our affections command\r\nus, as well as our consciences, there stand out our obligations toward our\r\nterritories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto Rico, Hawaii, the\r\nPhilippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such\r\nterritories, once regarded as mere possessions, are no longer to be\r\nselfishly exploited; they are part of the domain of public conscience and\r\nof serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for\r\nthe people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to\r\nthem as toward our own people in our domestic affairs. No doubt we shall\r\nsuccessfully enough bind Porto Rico and the Hawaiian Islands to ourselves\r\nby ties of justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our\r\nduty toward the Philippines is a more difficult and debatable matter. We\r\ncan satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of Porto\r\nRico by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded\r\nour own citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the\r\npeople of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for self-government already\r\ngranted them, but in the Philippines we must go further. We must hold\r\nsteadily in view their ultimate independence, and we must move toward the\r\ntime of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the\r\nfoundations thoughtfully and permanently laid.\r\n\r\nActing under the authority conferred upon the President by Congress, I have\r\nalready accorded the people of the islands a majority in both houses of\r\ntheir legislative body by appointing five instead of four native citizens\r\nto the membership of the commission. I believe that in this way we shall\r\nmake proof of their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility\r\nin the exercise of political power, and that the success of this step will\r\nbe sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by step\r\nwe should extend and perfect the system of self-government in the islands,\r\nmaking test of them and modifying them as experience discloses their\r\nsuccesses and their failures; that we should more and more put under the\r\ncontrol of the native citizens of the archipelago the essential instruments\r\nof their life, their local instrumentalities of government, their schools,\r\nall the common interests of their communities, and so by counsel and\r\nexperience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable\r\nto a people whose affairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and\r\nbelieve, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples.\r\nBy their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how\r\nbest to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw\r\nour supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and\r\nconfident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it.\r\n\r\nA duty faces us with regard to Alaska which seems to me very pressing and\r\nvery imperative; perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns both\r\nthe political and the material development of the Territory. The people of\r\nAlaska should be given the full Territorial form of government, and Alaska,\r\nas a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways.\r\nThese the Government should itself build and administer, and the ports and\r\nterminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use\r\nthem for the service and development of the country and its people.\r\n\r\nBut the construction of railways is only the first step; is only thrusting\r\nin the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the\r\ndoor. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is\r\nanother matter, to which I shall take the liberty of from time to time\r\ncalling your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by\r\nwell-considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical\r\nexpediency. It is part of our general problem of conservation. We have a\r\nfreer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the States of the\r\nUnion; and yet the principle and object are the same, wherever we touch it.\r\nWe must use the resources of the country, not lock them up. There need be\r\nno conflict or jealousy as between State and Federal authorities, for there\r\ncan be no essential difference of purpose between them. The resources in\r\nquestion must be used, but not destroyed or wasted; used, but not\r\nmonopolized upon any narrow idea of individual rights as against the\r\nabiding interests of communities. That a policy can be worked out by\r\nconference and concession which will release these resources and yet not\r\njeopard or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt; and it can be done on\r\nlines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and\r\ngovernments of the States concerned than to the people and Government of\r\nthe Nation at large, whose heritage these resources are. We must bend our\r\ncounsels to this end. A common purpose ought to make agreement easy.\r\n\r\nThree or four matters of special importance and significance I beg, that\r\nyou will permit me to mention in closing.\r\n\r\nOur Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more\r\neffectual service than it renders now in improving the conditions of mine\r\nlabor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more\r\nsafe. This is an all-important part of the work of conservation; and the\r\nconservation of human life and energy lies even nearer to our interests\r\nthan the preservation from waste of our material resources.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, in mere justice to the railway employees of the country, to\r\nprovide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act; and a law\r\nthat we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage of\r\nthose who administer the railroads of the country than to the advantage of\r\nthose whom they employ. The experience of a large number of the States\r\nabundantly proves that.\r\n\r\nWe ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain justice\r\nlike this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and economic\r\nreforms. Social justice comes first. Law is the machinery for its\r\nrealization and is vital only as it expresses and embodies it.\r\n\r\nAn international congress for the discussion of all questions that affect\r\nsafety at sea is now sitting in London at the suggestion of our own\r\nGovernment. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be learned and\r\nconsidered we ought to address ourselves, among other things, to the prompt\r\nalleviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and burdensome conditions which now\r\nsurround the employment of sailors and render it extremely difficult to\r\nobtain the services of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs\r\nif it is to be safely handled and brought to port.\r\n\r\nMay I not express the very real pleas-are I have experienced in\r\nco-operating with this Congress and sharing with it the labors of common\r\nservice to which it has devoted itself so unreservedly during the past\r\nseven months of uncomplaining concentration upon the business of\r\nlegislation? Surely it is a proper and pertinent part of my report on \"the\r\nstate of the Union\" to express my admiration for the diligence, the good\r\ntemper, and the full comprehension of public duty which has already been\r\nmanifested by both the Houses; and I hope that it may not be deemed an\r\nimpertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if I say with how much and\r\nhow constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the privilege of putting\r\nmy time and energy at their disposal alike in counsel and in action.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 8, 1914\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nThe session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of\r\nthe Sixty-third Congress, a Congress, I venture to say, which will long be\r\nremembered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it\r\nhas done, in loyal response to the thought and needs of the country. I\r\nshould like in this address to review the notable record and try to make\r\nadequate assessment of it; but no doubt we stand too near the work that has\r\nbeen done and are ourselves too much part of it to play the part of\r\nhistorians toward it.\r\n\r\nOur program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business is now\r\nvirtually complete. It has been put forth, as we intended, as a whole, and\r\nleaves no conjecture as to what is to follow. The road at last lies clear\r\nand firm before business. It is a road which it can travel without fear or\r\nembarrassment. It is the road to ungrudged, unclouded success. In it every\r\nhonest man, every man who believes that the public interest is part of his\r\nown interest, may walk with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past. While\r\nwe have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age\r\nhave been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own\r\npeople we did with the best that was in us, whether of character or of\r\nintelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon\r\nwhich we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult\r\nundertaking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now an\r\nestablished part of the legislation of the country. Its usefulness, its\r\neffects will disclose themselves in experience. What chiefly strikes us\r\nnow, as we look about us during these closing days of a year which will be\r\nforever memorable in the history of the world, is that we face new tasks,\r\nhave been facing them these six months, must face them in the months to\r\ncome,-face them without partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten\r\neverything but a common duty and the fact that we are representatives of a\r\ngreat people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself\r\nand to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed\r\nand anxious.\r\n\r\nWar has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of\r\nproduction. In Europe it is destroying men and resources wholesale and upon\r\na scale unprecedented and appalling, There is reason to fear that the time\r\nis near, if it be not already at hand, when several of the countries of\r\nEurope will find it difficult to do for their people what they have\r\nhitherto been always easily able to do,--many essential and fundamental\r\nthings. At any rate, they will need our help and our manifold services as\r\nthey have never needed them before; and we should be ready, more fit and\r\nready than we have ever been.\r\n\r\nIt is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually\r\nsupplied with innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce of which\r\nthey are in constant need and without which their economic development\r\nhalts and stands still can now get only a small part of what they formerly\r\nimported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. This\r\nis particularly true of our own neighbors, the States, great and small, of\r\nCentral and South America. Their lines of trade have hitherto run chiefly\r\nathwart the seas, not to our ports but to the ports of Great Britain and of\r\nthe older continent of Europe. I do not stop to inquire why, or to make any\r\ncomment on probable causes. What interests us just now is not the\r\nexplanation but the fact, and our duty and opportunity in the presence of\r\nit. Here are markets which we must supply, and we must find the means of\r\naction. The United States, this great people for whom we speak and act,\r\nshould be ready, as never before, to serve itself and to serve mankind;\r\nready with its resources, its energies, its forces of production, and its\r\nmeans of distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is a very practical matter, a matter of ways and means. We have the\r\nresources, but are we fully ready to use them? And, if we can make ready\r\nwhat we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not fully\r\nready; neither have we the means of distribution. We are willing, but we\r\nare not fully able. We have the wish to serve and to serve greatly,\r\ngenerously; but we are not prepared as we should be. We are not ready to\r\nmobilize our resources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately\r\nand at their best, without delay and without waste.\r\n\r\nTo speak plainly, we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted\r\nand hindered the development of our merchant marine. And now, when we need\r\nships, we have not got them. We have year after year debated, without end\r\nor conclusion, the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores\r\nand forests and water powers of our national domain in the rich States of\r\nthe West, when we should have acted; and they are still locked up. The key\r\nis still turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thousands of\r\nvigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The\r\nwater power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also, even\r\nin the eastern States, where we have worked and planned for generations, is\r\nstill not used as it might be, because we will and we won't; because the\r\nlaws we have made do not intelligently balance encouragement against\r\nrestraint. We withhold by regulation.\r\n\r\nI have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omissions,\r\neven at this short session of a Congress which would certainly seem to have\r\ndone all the work that could reasonably be expected of it. The time and the\r\ncircumstances are extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also.\r\n\r\nFortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, the one to unlock, with\r\nproper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, the other to\r\nencourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the\r\ngeneration of power, have already passed the House of Representatives and\r\nare ready for immediate consideration and action by the Senate. With the\r\ndeepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In them both we turn our\r\nbacks upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine policy of use\r\nand conservation, in the best sense of those words. We owe the one measure\r\nnot only to the people of that great western country for whose free and\r\nsystematic development, as it seems to me, our legislation has done so\r\nlittle, but also to the people of the Nation as a whole; and we as clearly\r\nowe the other fulfillment of our repeated promises that the water power of\r\nthe country should in fact as well as in name be put at the disposal of\r\ngreat industries which can make economical and profitable use of it, the\r\nrights of the public being adequately guarded the while, and monopoly in\r\nthe use prevented. To have begun such measures and not completed them would\r\nindeed mar the record of this great Congress very seriously. I hope and\r\nconfidently believe that they will be completed.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another great piece of legislation which awaits and should\r\nreceive the sanction of the Senate: I mean the bill which gives a larger\r\nmeasure of self-government to the people of the Philippines. How better, in\r\nthis time of anxious questioning and perplexed policy, could we show our\r\nconfidence in the principles of liberty, as the source as well as the\r\nexpression of life, how better could we demonstrate our own self-possession\r\nand steadfastness in the courses of justice and disinterestedness than by\r\nthus going calmly forward to fulfill our promises to a dependent people,\r\nwho will now look more anxiously than ever to see whether we have indeed\r\nthe liberality, the unselfishness, the courage, the faith we have boasted\r\nand professed. I can not believe that the Senate will let this great\r\nmeasure of constructive justice await the action of another Congress. Its\r\npassage would nobly crown the record of these two years of memorable\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nBut I think that you will agree with me that this does not complete the\r\ntoll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of\r\nwhich I have spoken if we have not the ships? How are we to build up a\r\ngreat trade if we have not the certain and constant means of\r\ntransportation upon which all profitable and useful commerce depends? And\r\nhow are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop without\r\nthem? To correct the many mistakes by which we have discouraged and all but\r\ndestroyed the merchant marine of the country, to retrace the steps by which\r\nwe have.. it seems almost deliberately, withdrawn our flag from the seas..\r\nexcept where, here and there, a ship of war is bidden carry it or some\r\nwandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and involve many\r\ndetailed items of legislation, and the trade which we ought immediately to\r\nhandle would disappear or find other channels while we debated the items.\r\n\r\nThe case is not unlike that which confronted us when our own continent was\r\nto be opened up to settlement and industry, and we needed long lines of\r\nrailway, extended means of transportation prepared beforehand, if\r\ndevelopment was not to lag intolerably and wait interminably. We lavishly\r\nsubsidized the building of transcontinental railroads. We look back upon\r\nthat with regret now, because the subsidies led to many scandals of which\r\nwe are ashamed; but we know that the railroads had to be built, and if we\r\nhad it to do over again we should of course build them, but in another way.\r\nTherefore I propose another way of providing the means of transportation,\r\nwhich must precede, not tardily follow, the development of our trade with\r\nour neighbor states of America. It may seem a reversal of the natural order\r\nof things, but it is true, that the routes of trade must be actually\r\nopened-by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges-before\r\nstreams of merchandise will flow freely and profitably through them.\r\n\r\nHence the pending shipping bill, discussed at the last session but as yet\r\npassed by neither House. In my judgment such legislation is imperatively\r\nneeded and can not wisely be postponed. The Government must open these\r\ngates of trade, and open them wide; open them before it is altogether\r\nprofitable to open them, or altogether reasonable to ask private capital to\r\nopen them at a venture. It is not a question of the Government monopolizing\r\nthe field. It should take action to make it certain that transportation at\r\nreasonable rates will be promptly provided, even where the carriage is not\r\nat first profitable; and then, when the carriage has become sufficiently\r\nprofitable to attract and engage private capital, and engage it in\r\nabundance, the Government ought to withdraw. I very earnestly hope that the\r\nCongress will be of this opinion, and that both Houses will adopt this\r\nexceedingly important bill.\r\n\r\nThe great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it\r\nis a matter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have seemed\r\nto render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session. But\r\nit can not be perfected yet, and therefore there are no other constructive\r\nmeasures the necessity for which I will at this time call your attention\r\nto; but I would be negligent of a very manifest duty were I not to call the\r\nattention of the Senate to the fact that the proposed convention for safety\r\nat sea awaits its confirmation and that the limit fixed in the convention\r\nitself for its acceptance is the last day of the present month. The\r\nconference in which this convention originated was called by the United\r\nStates; the representatives of the United States played a very influential\r\npart indeed in framing the provisions of the proposed convention; and those\r\nprovisions are in themselves for the most part admirable. It would hardly\r\nbe consistent with the part we have played in the whole matter to let it\r\ndrop and go by the board as if forgotten and neglected. It was ratified in\r\nMay by the German Government and in August by the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain. It marks a most hopeful and decided advance in international\r\ncivilization. We should show our earnest good faith in a great matter by\r\nadding our own acceptance of it.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter of which I must make special mention, if I am to\r\ndischarge my conscience, lest it should escape your attention. It may seem\r\na very small thing. It affects only a single item of appropriation. But\r\nmany human lives and many great enterprises hang upon it. It is the matter\r\nof making adequate provision for the survey and charting of our coasts. It\r\nis immediately pressing and exigent in connection with the immense coast\r\nline of Alaska, a coast line greater than that of the United States\r\nthemselves, though it is also very important indeed with regard to the\r\nolder coasts of the continent. We can not use our great Alaskan domain,\r\nships will not ply thither, if those coasts and their many hidden dangers\r\nare not thoroughly surveyed and charted. The work is incomplete at almost\r\nevery point. Ships and lives have been lost in threading what were supposed\r\nto be well-known main channels. We have not provided adequate vessels or\r\nadequate machinery for the survey and charting. We have used old vessels\r\nthat were not big enough or strong enough and which were so nearly\r\nunseaworthy that our inspectors would not have allowed private owners to\r\nsend them to sea. This is a matter which, as I have said, seems small, but\r\nis in reality very great. Its importance has only to be looked into to be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nBefore I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of\r\ndoors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear,\r\ndefinite, and steadfast?\r\n\r\nOne of these is economy in government expenditures. The duty of economy is\r\nnot debatable. It is manifest and imperative. In the appropriations we pass\r\nwe are spending the money of the great people whose servants we are,-not\r\nour own. We are trustees and responsible stewards in the spending. The only\r\nthing debatable and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and\r\npurpose clear is the kind of economy demanded of us. I assert with the\r\ngreatest confidence that the people of the United States are not jealous of\r\nthe amount their Government costs if they are sure that they get what they\r\nneed and desire for the outlay, that the money is being spent for objects\r\nof which they approve, and that it is being applied with good business\r\nsense and management.\r\n\r\nGovernments grow, piecemeal, both in their tasks and in the means by which\r\nthose tasks are to be performed, and very few Governments are organized, I\r\nventure to say, as wise and experienced business men would organize them if\r\nthey had a clean sheet of paper to write upon. Certainly the Government of\r\nthe United States is not. I think that it is generally agreed that there\r\nshould be a systematic reorganization and reassembling of its parts so as\r\nto secure greater efficiency and effect considerable savings in expense.\r\nBut the amount of money saved in that way would, I believe, though no doubt\r\nconsiderable in itself, running, it may be, into the millions, be\r\nrelatively small,-small, I mean, in proportion to the total necessary\r\noutlays of the Government. It would be thoroughly worth effecting, as every\r\nsaving would, great or small. Our duty is not altered by the scale of the\r\nsaving. But my point is that the people of the United States do not wish to\r\ncurtail the activities of this Government; they wish, rather, to enlarge\r\nthem; and with every enlargement, with the mere growth, indeed, of the\r\ncountry itself, there must come, of course, the inevitable increase of\r\nexpense. The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and\r\nought to be effected, by a careful study and assessment of the tasks to be\r\nperformed; and the money spent ought to be made to yield the best possible\r\nreturns in efficiency and achievement. And, like good stewards, we should\r\nso account for every dollar of our appropriations as to make it perfectly\r\nevident what it was spent for and in what way it was spent.\r\n\r\nIt is not expenditure but extravagance that we should fear being criticized\r\nfor; not paying for the legitimate enterprise and undertakings of a great\r\nGovernment whose people command what it should do, but adding what will\r\nbenefit only a few or pouring money out for what need not have been\r\nundertaken at all or might have been postponed or better and more\r\neconomically conceived and carried out. The Nation is not niggardly; it is\r\nvery generous. It will chide us only if we forget for whom we pay money out\r\nand whose money it is we pay. These are large and general standards, but\r\nthey are not very difficult of application to particular cases.\r\n\r\nThe other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the\r\nprinciples of our national life and policy. It is the subject of national\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nIt can not be discussed without first answering some very searching\r\nquestions. It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war.\r\nWhat is meant by being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon\r\nbrief notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained to arms?\r\nOf course we are not ready to do that; and we shall never be in time of\r\npeace so long as we retain our present political principles and\r\ninstitutions. And what is it that it is suggested we should be prepared to\r\ndo? To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do\r\nthat, and shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our\r\npeople away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military\r\nservice in times of peace.\r\n\r\nAllow me to speak with great plainness and directness upon this great\r\nmatter and to avow my convictions with deep earnestness. I have tried to\r\nknow what America is, what her people think, what they are, what they most\r\ncherish and hold dear. I hope that some of their finer passions are in my\r\nown heart,--some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to\r\nthis Government and which have made the voice of this people a voice of\r\npeace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and that,\r\nspeaking my own thoughts, I shall, at least in part, speak theirs also,\r\nhowever faintly and inadequately, upon this vital matter.\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact\r\nor drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say that\r\nthere is reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the\r\nintegrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power of any other\r\nnation we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of\r\ncommerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own\r\nlives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are, indeed, a true\r\nfriend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the\r\npossessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friendship can be\r\naccepted and is accepted without reservation, because it is offered in a\r\nspirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect.\r\nTherein lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and of concord.\r\nAnd we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have sought to\r\nearn. Just now we should be particularly jealous of it because it is our\r\ndearest present hope that this character and reputation may presently, in\r\nGod's providence, bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been\r\nvouchsafed any nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the\r\nworld and reconciliation and a healing settlement of many a matter that has\r\ncooled and interrupted the friendship of nations. This is the time above\r\nall others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by\r\nself-possession, our influence by preserving our ancient principles of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFrom the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to\r\nmilitary establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our present\r\nprinciples and ideals we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked,\r\nAre you ready to defend yourselves? we reply, Most assuredly, to the\r\nutmost; and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We will not\r\nask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of\r\nthemselves. There is another sort of energy in us. It will know how to\r\ndeclare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise. And\r\nespecially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to make our\r\nmoral insurance against the spread of the conflagration very definite and\r\ncertain and adequate indeed.\r\n\r\nLet us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing we can do or will do.\r\nWe must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the\r\npast, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but upon a\r\ncitizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right\r\nAmerican policy, based upon our accustomed principles and practices, to\r\nprovide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the training\r\nmay be made familiar with the use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill\r\nand maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should\r\nencourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young\r\nmen will learn to value. It is right that we should provide it not only,\r\nbut that we should make it as attractive as possible, and so induce our\r\nyoung men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom\r\nand can seek the physical development they need, for mere health's sake, if\r\nfor nothing more. Every means by which such things can be stimulated is\r\nlegitimate, and such a method smacks of true American ideas. It is right,\r\ntoo, that the National Guard of the States should be developed and\r\nstrengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations\r\nto our own people or with the established policy of our Government. And\r\nthis, also, not because the time or occasion specially calls for such\r\nmeasures, but because it should be our constant policy to make these\r\nprovisions for our national peace and safety.\r\n\r\nMore than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and\r\ncharacter of our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit me\r\nto say, would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that we had\r\nbeen thrown off our balance by a war with which we have nothing to do,\r\nwhose causes can not touch us, whose very existence affords us\r\nopportunities of friendship and disinterested service which should make us\r\nashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble.\r\nThis is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a government like\r\nours were raised up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to\r\nembody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting\r\nconcord which is based on justice and fair and generous dealing.\r\n\r\nA powerful navy we have always regarded as our proper and natural means of\r\ndefense, and it has always been of defense that we have thought, never of\r\naggression or of conquest. But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to\r\nbuild? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future as in\r\nthe past; and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in\r\nthat. Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us\r\njust what kind we should construct-and when will they be right for ten\r\nyears together, if the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and\r\nuses continues to change as we have seen it change under our very eyes in\r\nthese last few months?\r\n\r\nBut I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There is no new need to\r\ndiscuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst\r\nus are nervous and excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree upon a\r\npolicy of defense. The question has not changed its aspects because the\r\ntimes are not normal. Our policy will not be for an occasion. It will be\r\nconceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we will pursue at all\r\nseasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the\r\npeace of the world, the abiding friendship of states, and the unhampered\r\nfreedom of all with whom we deal. Let there be no misconception. The\r\ncountry has been misinformed. We have not been negligent of national\r\ndefense. We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting upon us.\r\nWe shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new\r\ncircumstance; and what is needed will be adequately done.\r\n\r\nI close, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of\r\npeace which challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will\r\nlast, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times with\r\nfree-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we\r\npossess. To develop our life and our resources; to supply our own people,\r\nand the people of the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty\r\nof our fields and our marts of trade to enrich the commerce of our own\r\nStates and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms, and our\r\nfactories, with the creations of our thought and the fruits of our\r\ncharacter,-this is what will hold our attention and our enthusiasm\r\nsteadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive to show in our life as\r\na nation what liberty and the inspirations of an emancipated spirit may do\r\nfor men and for societies, for individuals, for states, and for mankind.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 7, 1915\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nSince I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union\r\nthe war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun\r\nto disclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening and\r\nsinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every\r\nquarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the\r\nwhole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of\r\nreorganization and reconstruction such as statesmen and peoples have never\r\nbeen called upon to attempt before.\r\n\r\nWe have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so.\r\nNot only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have\r\nbrought the conflict on; it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was\r\nto be avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war\r\nand that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes\r\nof peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the\r\nbreakdown throughout the world of the industries by which its populations\r\nare fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the self-governed\r\nnations of this hemisphere to redress, if possible, the balance of economic\r\nloss and confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day\r\nof readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they\r\ncan be of infinite service.\r\n\r\nIn this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate\r\nlife and their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe but also by\r\na clear perception of international duty, the states of America have become\r\nconscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral\r\npartnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common\r\nsympathies and interests and duties which bid them stand together.\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the\r\nrepublics fighting their way to independence in Central and South America\r\nwhen the government of the United States looked upon itself as in some sort\r\nthe guardian of the republics to the South of her as against any\r\nencroachments or efforts at political control from the other side of the\r\nwater; felt it its duty to play the part even without invitation from them;\r\nand I think that we can claim that the task was undertaken with a true and\r\ndisinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested\r\nSelf-government of her independent peoples. But it was always difficult to\r\nmaintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose\r\nfreedom of action we sought to protect, and without provoking serious\r\nmisconceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful man of affairs must\r\nwelcome the altered circumstances of the new day in whose light we now\r\nstand, when there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but,\r\ninstead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves\r\nand our neighbors, in the interest of all America, north and south. Our\r\nconcern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Central and\r\nSouth America is not altered. We retain unabated the spirit that has\r\ninspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so\r\nfrankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make a\r\ncommon cause of national independence and of political liberty in America.\r\nBut that purpose is now better understood so far as it concerns ourselves.\r\nIt is known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known to have in it no\r\nthought of taking advantage of any government in this hemisphere or playing\r\nits political fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of America\r\nstand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genuine equality and\r\nunquestioned independence.\r\n\r\nWe have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the\r\ntest. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued\r\nremains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least\r\nproved that we will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake\r\nto impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is\r\noften a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set, and to\r\nwhich no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every\r\nAmerican who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tradition\r\nmust subscribe without reservation to the high doctrine of the Virginia\r\nBill of Rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up\r\nwas everywhere amongst us accepted as the creed of free men. That doctrine\r\nis, \"That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit,\r\nprotection, and security of the people, nation, or community\"; that \"of all\r\nthe various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is\r\ncapable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is\r\nmost effectually secured against the danger of maladministration; and that,\r\nwhen any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these\r\npurposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and\r\nindefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall\r\nbe judged most conducive to the public weal.\" We have unhesitatingly\r\napplied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico, and now hopefully\r\nawait the rebirth of the troubled Republic, which had so much of which to\r\npurge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical\r\nbut necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will not\r\ncoerce her; and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof\r\nto all America that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control.\r\n\r\nThe moral is, that the states of America are not hostile rivals but\r\ncooperating friends, and that their growing sense of community or interest,\r\nalike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give them\r\na new significance as factors in international affairs and in the political\r\nhistory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a\r\nunit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because\r\nthinking together, quick with common sympathies and common ideals.\r\nSeparated they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused\r\npolitics of a world of hostile rivalries; united in spirit and purpose they\r\ncannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny.\r\n\r\nThis is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is\r\nthe embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and\r\nindependence and liberty and mutual service.\r\n\r\nA very notable body of men recently met in the City of Washington, at the\r\ninvitation and as the guests of this Government, whose deliberations are\r\nlikely to be looked back to as marking a memorable turning point in the\r\nhistory of America. They were representative spokesmen of the several\r\nindependent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the\r\nfinancial and commercial relations of the republics of the two continents\r\nwhich nature and political fortune have so intimately linked together. I\r\nearnestly recommend to your perusal the reports of their proceedings and of\r\nthe actions of their committees. You will get from them, I think, a fresh\r\nconception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which Americans\r\nof both continents may draw together in practical cooperation and of what\r\nthe material foundations of this hopeful partnership of interest must\r\nconsist,-of how we should build them and of how necessary it is that we\r\nshould hasten their building.\r\n\r\nThere is, I venture to point out, an especial significance just now\r\nattaching to this whole matter of drawing the Americans together in bonds\r\nof honorable partnership and mutual advantage because of the economic\r\nreadjustments which the world must inevitably witness within the next\r\ngeneration, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful tasks. In\r\nthe performance of these tasks I believe the Americas to be destined to\r\nplay their parts together. I am interested to fix your attention on this\r\nprospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the\r\nfull significance of it to command your thought I cannot find the right\r\nlight in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very\r\nfont of my whole thought as I address you to-day. I mean national defense.\r\n\r\nNo one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we\r\nare appointed to speak can fail to perceive that their passion is for\r\npeace, their genius best displayed in the practice of the arts of peace.\r\nGreat democracies are not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war.\r\nTheir thought is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports\r\nlife and the uncensored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are\r\nnot in our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But just because we\r\ndemand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own\r\nlives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from\r\nwhatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not\r\npractice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of\r\nnational development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others.\r\nWe do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national\r\ndevelopment to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only\r\nourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in\r\nthese difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have\r\nmade common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea, and\r\nhave deemed it as important that our neighbors should be free from all\r\noutside domination as that we ourselves should be. We have set America\r\naside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen.\r\n\r\nOut of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means\r\nof asserting the rights of a people against aggression. And we are as\r\nfiercely jealous of coercive or dictatorial power within our own nation as\r\nof aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army except for\r\nuses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war; and we\r\nshall always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger\r\nthan is actually and continuously needed for the uses of days in which no\r\nenemies move against us. But we do believe in a body of free citizens ready\r\nand sufficient to take care of themselves and of the governments which they\r\nhave set up to serve them. In our constitutions themselves we have\r\ncommanded that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be\r\ninfringed,\" and our confidence has been that our safety in times of danger\r\nwould lie in the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as the\r\nfarmers rose at Lexington.\r\n\r\nBut war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. It is a thing of\r\ndisciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a\r\nsudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do\r\nwhen the summons comes to render themselves immediately available and\r\nimmediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this\r\nmatter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of\r\nthemselves and of it. The military arm of their government, which they will\r\nnot allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make\r\ntheir independence secure,-and not their own independence merely but the\r\nrights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they\r\nalso be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the\r\nworld, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are qualified by\r\nprinciple and by chastened ambition to play.\r\n\r\nIt is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the Department of War for\r\nmore adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before\r\nyou, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they\r\ncan be properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential\r\nfirst steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient.\r\n\r\nThey contemplate an increase of the standing force of the regular army from\r\nits present strength of five thousand and twenty-three officers and one\r\nhundred and two thousand nine hundred and eighty-five enlisted men of all\r\nservices to a strength of seven thousand one hundred and thirty-six\r\nofficers and one hundred and thirty-four thousand seven hundred and seven\r\nenlisted men, or 141,843, all told, all services, rank and file, by the\r\naddition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of\r\nengineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery,\r\nand four aero squadrons, besides seven hundred and fifty officers required\r\nfor a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of\r\ntraining the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, seven hundred\r\nand ninety-two noncommissioned officers for service in drill, recruiting\r\nand the like, and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the Quartermaster\r\nCorps, the Hospital Corps, the Ordnance Department, and other similar\r\nauxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the army\r\nadequate for its present duties, duties which it has to perform not only\r\nupon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts,\r\nbut also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus, and\r\nin Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nBy way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power\r\npromptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also\r\ncontemplates supplementing the army by a force of four hundred thousand\r\ndisciplined citizens, raised in increments of one hundred and thirty-three\r\nthousand a year throughout a period of three years. This it is proposed to\r\ndo by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the\r\ncountry would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for\r\npurposes of training for short periods throughout three years, and to come\r\nto the colors at call at any time throughout an additional \"furlough\"\r\nperiod of three years. This force of four hundred thousand men would be\r\nprovided with personal accoutrements as fast as enlisted and their\r\nequipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would\r\nbe assembled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in\r\nassociation with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual\r\ntraining would not necessarily exceed two months in the year.\r\n\r\nIt would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the younger men of the\r\ncountry whether they responded to such a call to service or not. It would\r\ndepend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether\r\nthey made it possible for the younger men in their employ to respond under\r\nfavorable conditions or not. I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic\r\ndevotion either of our young men or of those who give them\r\nemployment,--those for whose benefit and protection they would in fact\r\nenlist. I would look forward to the success of such an experiment with\r\nentire confidence.\r\n\r\nAt least so much by way of preparation for defense seems to me to be\r\nabsolutely imperative now. We cannot do less.\r\n\r\nThe programme which will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Navy is\r\nsimilarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which\r\nplans long matured shall be carried out; but it does make definite and\r\nexplicit a programme which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the\r\nminds of the Committees on Naval Affairs and disclosed in the debates of\r\nthe two Houses but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me\r\nvery clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the Congress\r\nto adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of\r\nstrength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within the\r\nnext five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our\r\nfirst and chief line of defense; we have always seen it to be our manifest\r\ncourse of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been\r\ncreating a navy which now ranks very high indeed among the navies of the\r\nmaritime nations. We should now definitely determine how we shall complete\r\nwhat we have begun, and how soon.\r\n\r\nThe programme to be laid before you contemplates the construction within\r\nfive years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers,\r\nfifty destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines,\r\nfour gunboats, one hospital ship, two ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships,\r\nand one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first\r\nyear provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers,\r\nthree scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,\r\ntwenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats, and one hospital ship; the\r\nsecond year, two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet\r\nsubmarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship;\r\nthe third year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers,\r\nfive destroyers, two fleet sub marines, and fifteen coast submarines; the\r\nfourth year, two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten\r\ndestroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition\r\nship, and one fuel oil ship; and the fifth year, two battleships, one\r\nbattle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,\r\nfifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the\r\npersonnel of the navy of seven thousand five hundred sailors, twenty-five\r\nhundred apprentice seamen, and fifteen hundred marines. This increase would\r\nbe sufficient to care for the ships which are to be completed within the\r\nfiscal year 1917 and also for the number of men which must be put in\r\ntraining to man the ships which will be completed early in 1918. It is also\r\nnecessary that the number of midshipmen at the Naval academy at Annapolis\r\nshould be increased by at least three hundred in order that the force of\r\nofficers should be more rapidly added to; and authority is asked to\r\nappoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineering\r\ncolleges, and for service in the aviation corps a certain number of men\r\ntaken from civil life.\r\n\r\nIf this full programme should be carried out we should have built or\r\nbuilding in 1921, according to the estimates of survival and standards of\r\nclassification followed by the General Board of the Department, an\r\neffective navy consisting of twenty-seven battleships of the first line,\r\nsix battle cruisers, twenty-five battleships of the second line, ten\r\narmored cruisers, thirteen scout cruisers, five first class cruisers, three\r\nsecond class cruisers, ten third class cruisers, one hundred and eight\r\ndestroyers, eighteen fleet submarines, one hundred and fifty-seven coast\r\nsubmarines, six monitors, twenty gunboats, four supply ships, fifteen fuel\r\nships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo vessels, eight vessels of\r\nspecial types, and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our\r\nneeds and worthy of our traditions.\r\n\r\nBut armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be\r\nconsidered if we are to provide for the supreme matter of national\r\nself-sufficiency and security in all its aspects. There are other great\r\nmatters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not.\r\nThere is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping\r\ninvolved in this great problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for\r\nmany weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should\r\nhave a great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to make\r\nus rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into\r\nevery sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we\r\nhave almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference\r\nand by a hopelessly blind and provincial policy of so-called economic\r\nprotection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our\r\ncommercial independence on the seas.\r\n\r\nFor it is a question of independence. If other nations go to war or seek to\r\nhamper each other's commerce, our merchants, it seems, are at their mercy,\r\nto do with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them as they\r\ndetermine. We have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own\r\ncommerce on the seas. Our independence is provincial, and is only on land\r\nand within our own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even\r\nthe ships of other nations in rivalry of their own trade, and are without\r\nmeans to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our\r\ngoods desired. Such a situation is not to be endured. It is of capital\r\nimportance not only that the United States should be its own carrier on the\r\nseas and enjoy the economic independence which only an adequate merchant\r\nmarine would give it, but also that the American hemisphere as a whole\r\nshould enjoy a like independence and self-sufficiency, if it is not to be\r\ndrawn into the tangle of European affairs. Without such independence the\r\nwhole question of our political unity and self-determination is very\r\nseriously clouded and complicated indeed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships\r\nof our own,--not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and\r\ncarrying much more: creating friendships and rendering indispensable\r\nservices to all interests on this side the water. They must move constantly\r\nback and forth between the Americas. They are the only shuttles that can\r\nweave the delicate fabric of sympathy, comprehension, confidence, and\r\nmutual dependence in which we wish to clothe our policy of America for\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThe task of building up an adequate merchant marine for America private\r\ncapital must ultimately undertake and achieve, as it has undertaken and\r\nachieved every other like task amongst us in the past, with admirable\r\nenterprise, intelligence, and vigor; and it seems to me a manifest dictate\r\nof wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may\r\nstand in the way of this much to be desired revival of our old independence\r\nand should facilitate in every possible way the building, purchase, and\r\nAmerican registration of ships. But capital cannot accomplish this great\r\ntask of a sudden. It must embark upon it by degrees, as the opportunities\r\nof trade develop. Something must be done at once; done to open routes and\r\ndevelop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped; done to open the\r\narteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned to\r\nrun,-especially between the two American continents, where they are,\r\nsingularly enough, yet to be created and quickened; and it is evident that\r\nonly the government can undertake such beginnings and assume the initial\r\nfinancial risks. When the risk has passed and private capital begins to\r\nfind its way in sufficient abundance into these new channels, the\r\ngovernment may withdraw. But it cannot omit to begin. It should take the\r\nfirst steps, and should take them at once. Our goods must not lie piled up\r\nat our ports and stored upon side tracks in freight cars which are daily\r\nneeded on the roads; must not be left without means of transport to any\r\nforeign quarter. We must not await the permission of foreign ship-owners\r\nand foreign governments to send them where we will.\r\n\r\nWith a view to meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and\r\navailing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present\r\nunparalleled opportunity of linking the two Americas together in bonds of\r\nmutual interest and service, an opportunity which may never return again if\r\nwe miss it now, proposals will be made to the present Congress for the\r\npurchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the\r\ngovernment similar to those made to the last Congress, but modified in some\r\nessential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt\r\nacceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed\r\nsince the former proposals were made has made the necessity for such action\r\nmore and more manifestly imperative. That need was then foreseen; it is now\r\nacutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting but\r\nwho can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested in\r\nthe particulars of the programme as I am in taking immediate advantage of\r\nthe great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act in this emergency.\r\nIn this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should\r\nprevail, and out of it should come an early solution of this pressing\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated\r\nwith the question of national safety and preparation for defense. That is\r\nour policy towards the Philippines and the people of Porto Rico. Our\r\ntreatment of them and their attitude towards us are manifestly of the first\r\nconsequence in the development of our duties in the world and in getting a\r\nfree hand to perform those duties. We must be free from every unnecessary\r\nburden or embarrassment; and there is no better way to be clear of\r\nembarrassment than to fulfil our promises and promote the interests of\r\nthose dependent on us to the utmost. Bills for the alteration and reform of\r\nthe government of the Philippines and for rendering fuller political\r\njustice to the people of Porto Rico were submitted to the sixty-third\r\nCongress. They will be submitted also to you. I need not particularize\r\ntheir details. You are most of you already familiar with them. But I do\r\nrecommend them to your early adoption with the sincere conviction that\r\nthere are few measures you could adopt which would more serviceably clear\r\nthe way for the great policies by which we wish to make good, now and\r\nalways, our right to lead in enterprises of peace and good will and\r\neconomic and political freedom.\r\n\r\nThe plans for the armed forces of the nation which I have outlined, and for\r\nthe general policy of adequate preparation for mobilization and defense,\r\ninvolve of course very large additional expenditures of money,-expenditures\r\nwhich will considerably exceed the estimated revenues of the government. It\r\nis made my duty by law, whenever the estimates of expenditure exceed the\r\nestimates of revenue, to call the attention of the Congress to the fact and\r\nsuggest any means of meeting the deficiency that it may be wise or possible\r\nfor me to suggest. I am ready to believe that it would be my duty to do so\r\nin any case; and I feel particularly bound to speak of the matter when it\r\nappears that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the\r\nCongress of measures which I myself urge it to adopt. Allow me, therefore,\r\nto speak briefly of the present state of the Treasury and of the fiscal\r\nproblems which the next year will probably disclose.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of June last there was an available balance in the general\r\nfund of the Treasury Of $104,170,105.78. The total estimated receipts for\r\nthe year 1916, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed\r\nby the last Congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the\r\nthirty-first of December, 1915, and that the present duty of one cent per\r\npound on sugar will be discontinued after the first of May, 1916, will be\r\n$670,365,500. The balance of June last and these estimated revenues come,\r\ntherefore, to a grand total of $774,535,605-78. The total estimated\r\ndisbursements for the present fiscal year, including twenty-five millions\r\nfor the Panama Canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency\r\nappropriations, and fifty thousand dollars for miscellaneous debt\r\nredemptions, will be $753,891,000; and the balance in the general fund of\r\nthe Treasury will be reduced to $20,644,605.78. The emergency revenue act,\r\nif continued beyond its present time limitation, would produce, during the\r\nhalf year then remaining, about forty-one millions. The duty of one cent\r\nper pound on sugar, if continued, would produce during the two months of\r\nthe fiscal year remaining after the first of May, about fifteen millions.\r\nThese two sums, amounting together to fifty-six millions, if added to the\r\nrevenues of the second half of the fiscal year, would yield the Treasury at\r\nthe end of the year an available balance Of $76,644,605-78.\r\n\r\nThe additional revenues required to carry out the programme of military and\r\nnaval preparation of which I have spoken, would, as at present estimated,\r\nbe for the fiscal year, 1917, $93,800,000. Those figures, taken with the\r\nfigures for the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose\r\nour financial problem for the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes imposed by\r\nthe emergency revenue act and the present duty on sugar are to be\r\ndiscontinued, and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year\r\nwill be only $20,644,605.78, that the disbursements for the Panama Canal\r\nwill again be about twenty-five millions, and that the additional\r\nexpenditures for the army and navy are authorized by the Congress, the\r\ndeficit in the general fund of the Treasury on the thirtieth of June, 1917,\r\nwill be nearly two hundred and thirty-five millions. To this sum at least\r\nfifty millions should be added to represent a safe working balance for the\r\nTreasury, and twelve millions to include the usual deficiency estimates in\r\n1917; and these additions would make a total deficit of some two hundred\r\nand ninety-seven millions. If the present taxes should be continued\r\nthroughout this year and the next, however, there would be a balance in the\r\nTreasury of some seventy-six and a half millions at the end of the present\r\nfiscal year, and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some fifty\r\nmillions, or, reckoning in sixty-two millions for deficiency appropriations\r\nand a safe Treasury balance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some\r\none hundred and twelve millions. The obvious moral of the figures is that\r\nit is a plain counsel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or\r\ntheir equivalents, and confine ourselves to the problem of providing one\r\nhundred and twelve millions of new revenue rather than two hundred and\r\nninety-seven millions.\r\n\r\nHow shall we obtain the new revenue? We are frequently reminded that there\r\nare many millions of bonds which the Treasury is authorized under existing\r\nlaw to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the\r\nconstruction of the Panama Canal; and it is true that bonds to the amount\r\nof approximately $222,000,000 are now available for that purpose. Prior to\r\n1913, $134,631,980 of these bonds had actually been sold to recoup the\r\nexpenditures at the Isthmus; and now constitute a considerable item of the\r\npublic debt. But I, for one, do not believe that the people of this country\r\napprove of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is\r\nshort-sighted finance. It can be justified only when permanent things are\r\nto be accomplished which many generations will certainly benefit by and\r\nwhich it seems hardly fair that a single generation should pay for. The\r\nobjects we are now proposing to spend money for cannot be so classified,\r\nexcept in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be done in\r\nthe interest of posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a clear\r\ndictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now,\r\nI hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the\r\ncountry are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to\r\ncarry, and to know from the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by\r\ninternal taxation.\r\n\r\nTo what sources, then, shall we turn? This is so peculiarly a question\r\nwhich the gentlemen of the House of Representatives are expected under the\r\nConstitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expect me to do\r\nmore than discuss it in very general terms. We should be following an\r\nalmost universal example of modern governments if we were to draw the\r\ngreater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the income\r\ntaxes. By somewhat lowering the present limits of exemption and the figure\r\nat which the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and by increasing, step by\r\nstep throughout the present graduation, the surtax itself, the income taxes\r\nas at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books\r\nof the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere making\r\nthe burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings are\r\nfully and accurately set out in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwhich will be immediately laid before you.\r\n\r\nAnd there are many additional sources of revenue which can justly be\r\nresorted to without hampering the industries of the country or putting any\r\ntoo great charge upon individual expenditure. A tax of one cent per gallon\r\non gasoline and naphtha would yield, at the present estimated production,\r\n$10,000,000; a tax of fifty cents per horse power on automobiles and\r\ninternal explosion engines, $15,000,000; a stamp tax on bank cheques,\r\nprobably $18,000,000; a tax of twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron,\r\n$10,000,000; a tax of twenty-five cents per ton on fabricated iron and\r\nsteel, probably $10,000,000. In a country of great industries like this it\r\nought to be easy to distribute the burdens of taxation without making them\r\nanywhere bear too heavily or too exclusively upon any one set of persons or\r\nundertakings. What is clear is, that the industry of this generation should\r\npay the bills of this generation.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to you to-day, Gentlemen, upon a single theme, the thorough\r\npreparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of\r\nentire freedom to play the impartial role in this hemisphere and in the\r\nworld which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to it. I\r\nhave had in my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger\r\narising out of our relations with other nations. We are at peace with all\r\nthe nations of the world, and there is reason to hope that no question in\r\ncontroversy between this and other Governments will lead to any serious\r\nbreach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and\r\npolicy have been land may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that the\r\ngravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered\r\nwithin our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush to\r\nadmit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous\r\nnaturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who\r\nhave poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national\r\nlife; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our\r\nGovernment into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought\r\nit effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase\r\nour politics to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their number is not great as\r\ncompared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our nation\r\nhas been enriched in recent generations out of virile foreign stock; but it\r\nis great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it\r\nnecessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we\r\nmay be purged of their corrupt distempers. America never witnessed anything\r\nlike this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn into its own\r\ncitizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied some of\r\nthe best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation that\r\nin a high day of old staked its very life to free itself from every\r\nentanglement that had darkened the fortunes of the older nations and set up\r\na new standard here, that men of such origins and such free choices of\r\nallegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the Government and\r\npeople who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud\r\ncountry once more a hotbed of European passion. A little while ago such a\r\nthing would have seemed incredible. Because it was incredible we made no\r\npreparation for it. We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for it, as\r\nif we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! But the\r\nugly and incredible thing has actually come about and we are without\r\nadequate federal laws to deal with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the\r\nearliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do\r\nnothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such\r\ncreatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are\r\nnot many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power\r\nshould close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property,\r\nthey have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the\r\nGovernment, they have sought to pry into every confidential transaction of\r\nthe Government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is possible\r\nto deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in\r\nwhich they may be dealt with.\r\n\r\nI wish that it could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken\r\nsentiments of allegiance to the governments under which they were born, had\r\nbeen guilty of disturbing the self-possession and misrepresenting the\r\ntemper and principles of the country during these days of terrible war,\r\nwhen it would seem that every man who was truly an American would\r\ninstinctively make it his duty and his pride to keep the scales of judgment\r\neven and prove himself a partisan of no nation but his own. But it cannot.\r\nThere are some men among us, and many resident abroad who, though born and\r\nbred in the United States and calling themselves Americans, have so\r\nforgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate\r\nsympathy with one or the other side in the great European conflict above\r\ntheir regard for the peace and dignity of the United States. They also\r\npreach and practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions\r\nof the mind and heart; but I should not speak of others without also\r\nspeaking of these and expressing the even deeper humiliation and scorn\r\nwhich every self-possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel\r\nwhen he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWhile we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her\r\nsecurity and her effective power we must not fall into the patent error of\r\nsupposing that her real strength comes from armaments and mere safeguards\r\nof written law. It comes, of course, from her people, their energy, their\r\nsuccess in their undertakings, their free opportunity to use the natural\r\nresources of our great home land and of the lands outside our continental\r\nborders which look to us for protection, for encouragement, and for\r\nassistance in their development; from the organization and freedom and\r\nvitality of our economic life. The domestic questions which engaged the\r\nattention of the last Congress are more vital to the nation in this its\r\ntime of test than at any other time. We cannot adequately make ready for\r\nany trial of our strength unless we wisely and promptly direct the force of\r\nour laws into these all-important fields of domestic action. A matter which\r\nit seems to me we should have very much at heart is the creation of the\r\nright instrumentalities by which to mobilize our economic resources in any\r\ntime of national necessity. I take it for granted that I do not need your\r\nauthority to call into systematic consultation with the directing officers\r\nof the army and navy men of recognized leadership and ability from among\r\nour citizens who are thoroughly familiar, for example, with the\r\ntransportation facilities of the country and therefore competent to advise\r\nhow they may be coordinated when the need arises, those who can suggest the\r\nbest way in which to bring about prompt cooperation among the manufacturers\r\nof the country, should it be necessary, and those who could assist to bring\r\nthe technical skill of the country to the aid of the Government in the\r\nsolution of particular problems of defense. I only hope that if I should\r\nfind it feasible to constitute such an advisory body the Congress would be\r\nwilling to vote the small sum of money that would be needed to defray the\r\nexpenses that would probably be necessary to give it the clerical and\r\nadministrative Machinery with which to do serviceable work.\r\n\r\nWhat is more important is, that the industries and resources of the country\r\nshould be available and ready for mobilization. It is the more imperatively\r\nnecessary, therefore, that we should promptly devise means for doing what\r\nwe have not yet done: that we should give intelligent federal aid and\r\nstimulation to industrial and vocational education, as we have long done in\r\nthe large field of our agricultural industry; that, at the same time that\r\nwe safeguard and conserve the natural resources of the country we should\r\nput them at the disposal of those who will use them promptly and\r\nintelligently, as was sought to be done in the admirable bills submitted to\r\nthe last Congress from its committees on the public lands, bills which I\r\nearnestly recommend in principle to your consideration; that we should put\r\ninto early operation some provision for rural credits which will add to the\r\nextensive borrowing facilities already afforded the farmer by the Reserve\r\nBank Act, adequate instrumentalities by which long credits may be obtained\r\non land mortgages; and that we should study more carefully than they have\r\nhitherto been studied the right adaptation of our economic arrangements to\r\nchanging conditions.\r\n\r\nMany conditions about which we I-lave repeatedly legislated are being\r\naltered from decade to decade, it is evident, under our very eyes, and are\r\nlikely to change even more rapidly and more radically in the days\r\nimmediately ahead of us, when peace has returned to the world and the\r\nnations of Europe once more take up their tasks of commerce and industry\r\nwith the energy of those who must bestir themselves to build anew. Just\r\nwhat these changes will be no one can certainly foresee or confidently\r\npredict. There are no calculable, because no stable, elements in the\r\nproblem. The most we can do is to make certain that we have the necessary\r\ninstrumentalities of information constantly at our service so that we may\r\nbe sure that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we come to act,\r\nif it should be necessary to act at all. We must first certainly know what\r\nit is that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to. I may ask the privilege of\r\naddressing you more at length on this important matter a little later in\r\nyour session.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime may I make this suggestion? The transportation problem is\r\nan exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from\r\ntime to time of late been reason to fear that our railroads would not much\r\nlonger be able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and\r\ncoordinated I suggest that it would be wise to provide for a commission of\r\ninquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole question whether\r\nour laws as at present framed and administered are as serviceable as they\r\nmight be in the solution of the problem. It is obviously a problem that\r\nlies at the very foundation of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry\r\nought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth considering and we\r\nneed to know all sides of the matter if we mean to do anything in the field\r\nof federal legislation.\r\n\r\nNo one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regulation of\r\nthe railways of the country by federal commission has had admirable results\r\nand has fully justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the\r\npolicy of regulation was originally proposed. The question is not what\r\nshould we undo? It is, whether there is anything else we can do that would\r\nsupply us with effective means, in the very process of regulation, for\r\nbettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for\r\nmaking them more useful servants of the country as a whole. It seems to me\r\nthat it might be the part of wisdom, therefore, before further legislation\r\nin this field is attempted, to look at the whole problem of coordination\r\nand efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and\r\nopinion, as a guide to dealing with the several parts of it.\r\n\r\nFor what we are seeking now, what in my mind is the single thought of this\r\nmessage, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We\r\nshould serve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of\r\ncommon men for self-government, industry, justice, liberty and peace. We\r\nshould see to it that it lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law,\r\nto make it sufficient to play its part with energy, safety, and assured\r\nsuccess. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets of a new age.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 5, 1916\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of\r\ncommunicating to you from time to time information of the state of the\r\nUnion and recommending to your consideration such legislative measures as\r\nmay be judged necessary and expedient, I shall continue the practice, which\r\nI hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several\r\nheads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of\r\nthe public service and confine myself to those matters of more general\r\npublic policy with which it seems necessary and feasible to deal at the\r\npresent session of the Congress.\r\n\r\nI realize the limitations of time under which you will necessarily act at\r\nthis session and shall make my suggestions as few as possible; but there\r\nwere some things left undone at the last session which there will now be\r\ntime to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public\r\nto do at once.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it seems to me imperatively necessary that the earliest\r\npossible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures\r\nof the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to\r\nrecommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public\r\ndangers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed,\r\nand which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the\r\ncountry and their locomotive engineers, conductors and trainmen.\r\n\r\nI then recommended:\r\n\r\nFirst, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative\r\nreorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines\r\nembodied in the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives and\r\nnow awaiting action by the Senate; in order that the Commission may be\r\nenabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon\r\nit with a promptness and thoroughness which are, with its present\r\nconstitution and means of action, practically impossible.\r\n\r\nSecond, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of\r\nwork and wages in the employment of all railway employes who are actually\r\nengaged in the work of operating trains in interstate transportation.\r\n\r\nThird, the authorization of the appointment by the President of a small\r\nbody of men to observe actual results in experience of the adoption of the\r\neight-hour day in railway transportation alike for the men and for the\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nFourth, explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such\r\nadditional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered\r\nnecessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been\r\noffset by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts\r\ndisclosed justify the increase.\r\n\r\nFifth, an amendment of the existing Federal statute which provides for the\r\nmediation, conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the\r\npresent by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of\r\naccommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of\r\nthe merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a\r\nstrike or lockout may lawfully be attempted.\r\n\r\nAnd, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the Executive of the power, in\r\ncase of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such\r\nrolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for\r\nmilitary use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to\r\ndraft into the military service of the United States such train crews and\r\nadministrative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and\r\nefficient use.\r\n\r\nThe second and third of these recommendations the Congress immediately\r\nacted on: it established the eight-hour day as the legal basis of work and\r\nwages in train service and it authorized the appointment of a commission to\r\nobserve and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures\r\nmost immediately needed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions\r\nuntil an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consideration\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew. The power of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase of rates on the\r\nground referred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the\r\nCongress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the\r\nscope of the commission's authority or its inclination to do justice when\r\nthere is no reason to doubt either.\r\n\r\nThe other suggestions-the increase in the Interstate Commerce Commission's\r\nmembership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties; the\r\nprovision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial\r\ndisputes, and the grant to the Executive of the power to control and\r\noperate the railways when necessary in time of war or other like public\r\nnecessity-I now very earnestly renew.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have\r\nentrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding\r\nthem in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to\r\nact upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Interstate Commerce Commission now find it practically\r\nimpossible, with its present membership and organization, to perform its\r\ngreat functions promptly and thoroughly, but it is not unlikely that it may\r\npresently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally\r\nheavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to\r\nprofound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of\r\narbitration and conciliation which the Congress can easily and promptly\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nAnd all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the\r\nExecutive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroads for the\r\nconcentration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed\r\nand whenever they are needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a program of regulation, prevention and administrative efficiency\r\nwhich argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one\r\nof its items, the increase in the efficiency of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, the House of Representatives has already acted; its action\r\nneeds only the concurrence of the Senate.\r\n\r\nI would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the Congress would hesitate\r\nto act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any I\r\noccupation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he\r\ndesired to leave.\r\n\r\nTo pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave\r\nhis work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to\r\nadopt a new principle into our jurisprudence, which I take it for granted\r\nwe are not prepared to introduce.\r\n\r\nBut the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall\r\nnot be stopped or interrupted by the concerted action of organized bodies\r\nof men until a public investigation shall have been instituted, which shall\r\nmake the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of\r\nthe nation, is not to propose any such principle.\r\n\r\nIt is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of\r\npowerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial\r\nprocesses of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an\r\nopportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between\r\nemploye and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement\r\nof the merits, and opportunity to consider all practicable means of\r\nconciliation or arbitration.\r\n\r\nI can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by\r\nsociety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing\r\narbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It\r\ncan and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the interests\r\nand liberties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of\r\nsociety itself.\r\n\r\nThree matters of capital importance await the action of the Senate which\r\nhave already been acted upon by the House of Representatives; the bill\r\nwhich seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in\r\npromoting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some\r\nto be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending\r\nthe present organic law of Porto Rico; and the bill proposing a more\r\nthorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in\r\nelections, commonly called the Corrupt Practices Act.\r\n\r\nI need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their\r\nurgency lies in the manifest circumstances which render their adoption at\r\nthis time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would seriously\r\njeopard the interests of the country and of the Government.\r\n\r\nImmediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in\r\nelections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the\r\nother measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse\r\nbefore another election in which Federal offices are to be filled; but it\r\nwould greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt\r\nwith while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the\r\npresent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under\r\nrecent observation, and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied\r\nin the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very\r\nserious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at\r\nhand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in\r\nthe mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for\r\nguidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose.\r\n\r\nI shall not argue at length the desirability of giving a freer hand in the\r\nmatter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the\r\nessential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will\r\npresently, will immediately assume, has indeed already assumed a magnitude\r\nunprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary\r\ninstrumentalities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether\r\nthey could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws.\r\n\r\nWe should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted\r\nlaw for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license.\r\nThe thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape\r\nus if we hesitate or delay.\r\n\r\nThe argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto Rico\r\nis brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and\r\nregulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have\r\ncreated expectations of extended privilege which we have not satisfied.\r\nThere is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious\r\ndoubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of\r\nthe pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to\r\ndo in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of the Congress a bill was passed by the Senate which\r\nprovides for the promotion of vocational and industrial education, which is\r\nof vital importance to the whole country because it concerns a matter, too\r\nlong neglected, upon which the thorough industrial preparation of the\r\ncountry for the critical years of economic development immediately ahead of\r\nus in very large measure depends.\r\n\r\nMay I not urge its early and favorable consideration by the House of\r\nRepresentatives and its early enactment into law? It contains plans which\r\naffect all interests and all parts of the country, and I am sure that there\r\nis no legislation now pending before the Congress whose passage the country\r\nawaits with more thoughtful approval or greater impatience to see a great\r\nand admirable thing set in the way of being done.\r\n\r\nThere are other matters already advanced to the stage of conference between\r\nthe two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some\r\npracticable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found an\r\naction taken upon them.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this is, gentlemen, probably the last occasion I shall have to\r\naddress the Sixty-fourth Congress, I hope that you will permit me to say\r\nwith what genuine pleasure and satisfaction I have co-operated with you in\r\nthe many measures of constructive policy with which you have enriched the\r\nlegislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such\r\ncompany. I take the liberty of congratulating you upon the completion of a\r\nrecord of rare serviceableness and distinction.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 4, 1917\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nEight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you.\r\nThey have been months crowded with events of immense and grave significance\r\nfor us. I shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize those events.\r\nThe practical particulars of the part we have played in them will be laid\r\nbefore you in the reports of the executive departments. I shall discuss\r\nonly our present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and\r\nthe immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nI shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs\r\ndone and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long\r\nsince become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need\r\nto be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very\r\ngrave scrutiny our objectives and the measures by which we mean to attain\r\nthem; for the purpose of discussion here in this place is action, and our\r\naction must move straight toward definite ends. Our object is, of course,\r\nto win the war; and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted\r\nuntil it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question,\r\nWhen shall we consider the war won?\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental\r\nmatter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war is about\r\nand what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their\r\npurpose in it.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to\r\nthose who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent-who does not? I\r\nbear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and\r\ntroublesome. I also see men here and there fling themselves in impotent\r\ndisloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the Nation. I hear men\r\ndebate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way in which we may\r\nattain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But I know that none of\r\nthese speaks for the Nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They\r\nmay safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say\r\nplainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and\r\nwhat part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching issues. We are\r\nthe spokesmen of the American people, and they have a right to know whether\r\ntheir purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the\r\ndefeat once for all of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and render\r\nit impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with\r\ntheirs and what action we propose. They are impatient with those who desire\r\npeace by any sort of compromise deeply and indignantly impatient--but they\r\nwill be equally impatient with us if we do not make it plain to them what\r\nour objectives are and what we are planning for in seeking to make conquest\r\nof peace by arms.\r\n\r\nI believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this\r\nintolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly\r\nface, this menace of combined intrigue and force which we now see so\r\nclearly as the German power, a thing without conscience or honor of\r\ncapacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed and, if it be not utterly\r\nbrought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the\r\nnations; and second, that when this thing and its power are indeed defeated\r\nand the time comes that we can discuss peace when the German people have\r\nspokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready in\r\nthe name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to\r\nwhat shall henceforth be the bases of law and of covenant for the life of\r\nthe world-we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace, and\r\npay it ungrudgingly.\r\n\r\nWe know what that price will be. It will be full, impartial justice-justice\r\ndone at every point and to every nation that the final settlement must\r\naffect, our enemies as well as our friends.\r\n\r\nYou catch, with me, the voices of humanity that are in the air. They grow\r\ndaily more audible, more articulate, more persuasive, and they come from\r\nthe hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the war shall not end in\r\nvindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or\r\npunished because the irresponsible rulers of a single country have\r\nthemselves done deep and abominable wrong. It is this thought that has been\r\nexpressed in the formula, \"No annexations, no contributions, no punitive\r\nindemnities.\"\r\n\r\nJust because this crude formula expresses the instinctive judgment as to\r\nright of plain men everywhere, it has been made diligent use of by the\r\nmasters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray and the\r\npeople of every other country their agents could reach-in order that a\r\npremature peace might be brought about before autocracy has been taught its\r\nfinal and convincing lesson and the people of the world put in control of\r\ntheir own destinies.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no reason why\r\na right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under the\r\npatronage of its real friends. Let it be said again that autocracy must\r\nfirst be shown the utter futility of its claim to power or leadership in\r\nthe modern world. It is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long\r\nas such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of\r\nGermany command. Not until that has been done can right be set up as\r\narbiter and peacemaker among the nations. But when that has been done-as,\r\nGod willing, it assuredly will be-we shall at last be free to do an\r\nunprecedented thing, and this is the time to avow our purpose to do it. We\r\nshall be free to base peace on generosity and justice, to the exclusions of\r\nall selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the victors.\r\n\r\nLet there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is to win\r\nthe war and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is\r\naccomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of\r\nmoney, or of materials, is being devoted and will continue to be devoted to\r\nthat purpose until it is achieved. Those who desire to bring peace about\r\nbefore that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere.\r\nWe will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the\r\nGerman people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that\r\nthey are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and reparation\r\nof the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium\r\nwhich must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and\r\npeoples than their own--over the great empire of Austria-Hungary, over\r\nhitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey and within Asia-which must be\r\nrelinquished.\r\n\r\nGermany's success by skill, by industry, by knowledge, by enterprise we did\r\nnot grudge or oppose, but admired, rather. She had built up for herself a\r\nreal empire of trade and influence, secured by the peace of the world. We\r\nwere content to abide by the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce\r\nthat were involved for us in her success, and stand or fall as we had or\r\ndid not have the brains and the initiative to surpass her. But at the\r\nmoment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them\r\naway, to establish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to\r\nbe established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust\r\nwhere she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace\r\nwe make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and\r\nhappy peoples of Belgium and Northern France from the Prussian conquest and\r\nthe Prussian menace, but it must deliver also the peoples of\r\nAustria-Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans and the peoples of Turkey,\r\nalike in Europe and Asia, from the impudent and alien dominion of the\r\nPrussian military and commercial autocracy.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, however, to ourselves, to say that we do not wish in any way to\r\nimpair or to rearrange the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is no affair of ours\r\nwhat they do with their own life, either industrially or politically. We do\r\nnot purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see\r\nthat their affairs are left in their own hands, in all matters, great or\r\nsmall. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and\r\nfor the people of the Turkish Empire the right and opportunity to make\r\ntheir own lives safe, their own fortunes secure against oppression or\r\ninjustice and from the dictation of foreign courts or parties.\r\n\r\nAnd our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like\r\nkind. We intend no wrong against the German Empire, no interference with\r\nher internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other absolutely\r\nunjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we have professed to\r\nlive by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation.\r\n\r\nThe people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now permit to\r\ndeceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the\r\nvery life and existence of their empire, a war of desperate self-defense\r\nagainst deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly\r\nfalse, and we must seek by the utmost openness and candor as to our real\r\naims to convince them of its falseness. We are in fact fighting for their\r\nemancipation from the fear, along with our own-from the fear as well as\r\nfrom the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after\r\nworld empire. No one is threatening the existence or the independence of\r\nthe peaceful enterprise of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nThe worst that can happen to the detriment the German people is this, that\r\nif they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obliged to live\r\nunder ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace of\r\nthe world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could\r\nnot trust, it might be impossible to admit them to the partnership of\r\nnations which must henceforth guarantee the world's peace. That partnership\r\nmust be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It\r\nmight be impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany\r\nto the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the\r\nother partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in\r\nthat; and such a situation, inevitable, because of distrust, would in the\r\nvery nature of things sooner or later cure itself, by processes which would\r\nassuredly set in.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be\r\nrighted. That, of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the\r\ncommission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. The world will\r\nnot permit the commission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and\r\nsettlement. Statesmen must by this time have learned that the opinion of\r\nthe world is everywhere wide awake and fully comprehends the issues\r\ninvolved. No representative of any self-governed nation will dare disregard\r\nit by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were\r\nentered into at the Congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people\r\nhere and everywhere throughout the world, the people who enjoy no privilege\r\nand have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is\r\nthe air all governments must henceforth breathe if they would live.\r\n\r\nIt is in the full disclosing light of that thought that all policies must\r\nbe received and executed in this midday hour of the world's life. Ger. man\r\nrulers have been able to upset the peace of the world only because the\r\nGerman people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the\r\ncomradeship of the other peoples of the world either in thought or in\r\npurpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be\r\nset up as a rule of conduct for those who exercised authority over them.\r\nBut the Congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the\r\ntides that run now in the hearts and consciences of free men everywhere.\r\nIts conclusions will run with those tides.\r\n\r\nAll those things have been true from the very beginning of this stupendous\r\nwar; and I cannot help thinking that if they had been made plain at the\r\nvery outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have\r\nbeen once for all enlisted on the side of the Allies, suspicion and\r\ndistrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had\r\nthey believed these things at the very moment of their revolution, and had\r\nthey been confirmed in that belief since, the sad reverses which have\r\nrecently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable\r\ngovernment of free men might have been avoided. The Russian people have\r\nbeen poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people\r\nin the dark, and the poison has been administered by the very same hand.\r\nThe only possible antidote is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly\r\nor too often.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak\r\nthese declarations of purpose, to add these specific interpretations to\r\nwhat I took the liberty of saying to the Senate in January. Our entrance\r\ninto the war has not altered out attitude towards the settlement that must\r\ncome when it is over.\r\n\r\nWhen I said in January that the nations of the world were entitled not only\r\nto free pathways upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to\r\nthose-pathways, I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller\r\nand weaker nations alone which need our countenance and support, but also\r\nof the great and powerful nations and of our present enemies as well as our\r\npresent associates in the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now, of\r\nAustria herself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Poland.\r\n\r\nJustice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are\r\nseeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world,\r\nand must seek them candidly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove\r\nto be the expedient.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to\r\nits righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all\r\nimpediments to success, and we must make every adjustment of law that will\r\nfacilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a\r\nfighting unit.\r\n\r\nOne very embarrassing obstacle that stands hi our way is that we are at war\r\nwith Germany but not with her allies. I, therefore, very earnestly\r\nrecommend that the Congress immediately declare the United States in a\r\nstate of war with Austria-Hungary. Does it seem strange to you that this\r\nshould be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It\r\nis not. It is in fact the inevitable logic of what I have said.\r\nAustria-Hungary is for the time being not her own mistress but simply the\r\nvassal of the German Government.\r\n\r\nWe must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in\r\nthis stern business. The Government of Austria and Hungary is not acting\r\nupon its own initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its\r\nown peoples, but as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its\r\nforce with our own and regard the Central Powers as but one. The war can be\r\nsuccessfully conducted in no other way.\r\n\r\nThe same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and\r\nBulgaria. They also are the tools of Germany, but they are mere tools and\r\ndo not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go\r\nwherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we\r\nshould go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us, and\r\nnot heed any others.\r\n\r\nThe financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest\r\nthemselves as the war and its undertakings develop, but I will take the\r\nliberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to\r\nme to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole\r\nforce and energy.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation of\r\nthe last session with regard to alien enemies, and also necessary, I\r\nbelieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance\r\nand departure of all persons into and from the United States.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be enacted defining as a criminal offense every wilful\r\nviolation of the presidential proclamation relating to alien enemies\r\npromulgated under section 4o67 of the revised statutes and providing\r\nappropriate punishments; and women, as well as men, should be included\r\nunder the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be\r\nfed and housed at the expense of the Government in the detention camps, and\r\nit would be the purpose of the legislation I have suggested to confine\r\noffenders among them in the penitentiaries and other similar institutions\r\nwhere they could be made to work as other criminals do.\r\n\r\nRecent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further in\r\nauthorizing the Government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and\r\ndemand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrained\r\nselfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in several branches of\r\nindustry, it still runs impudently rampant in others. The farmers for\r\nexample, complain with a great deal of justice that, while the regulation\r\nof food prices restricts their incomes, no restraints are placed upon the\r\nprices of most of the things they must themselves purchase; and similar\r\ninequities obtain on all sides.\r\n\r\nIt is imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the\r\nwater power of the country, and also of the consideration of the systematic\r\nand yet economical development of such of the natural resources of the\r\ncountry as are still under the control of the Federal Government should be\r\nimmediately resumed and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the\r\nearliest possible moment. The pressing need of such legislation is daily\r\nbecoming more obvious.\r\n\r\nThe legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated\r\ncombinations among our exporters in order to provide for our foreign trade\r\na more effective organization and method of co-operation ought by all means\r\nto be completed at this session.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg that the members of the House of Representatives will permit me\r\nto express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any but a very\r\nwasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriations of the\r\npublic moneys which must continue to be made if the war is to be properly\r\nsustained, unless the House will consent to return to its former practice\r\nof initiating and preparing all appropriation bills through a single\r\ncommittee, in order that responsibility may be centered, expenditures\r\nstandardized and made uniform, and waste and duplication as much as\r\npossible avoided.\r\n\r\nAdditional legislation may also become necessary before the present\r\nCongress again adjourns in order to effect the most efficient co-ordination\r\nand operation of the railways and other transportation systems of the\r\ncountry; but to that I shall, if circumstances should demand, call the\r\nattention of Congress upon another occasion.\r\n\r\nIf I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effective\r\nconduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am\r\nperfectly clear about is that in the present session of the Congress our\r\nwhole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous, rapid\r\nand successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war.\r\n\r\nWe can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know\r\nthat for us this is a war of high principle, debased by no selfish ambition\r\nof conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world knows, that\r\nwe have been forced into it to save the very institutions we five under\r\nfrom corruption and destruction. The purpose of the Central Powers strikes\r\nstraight at the very heart of everything we believe in; their methods of\r\nwarfare outrage every principle of humanity and of knightly honor; their\r\nintrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our people;\r\ntheir sinister and secret diplomacy has sought to take our very territory\r\naway from us and disrupt the union of the states. Our safety would be at an\r\nend, our honor forever sullied and brought into contempt, were we to permit\r\ntheir triumph. They are striking at the very existence of democracy and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIt is because it is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in which\r\nall the free peoples of the world are banded together for the vindication\r\nof right, a war for the preservation of our nation, of all that it has held\r\ndear, of principle and of purpose, that we feel ourselves doubly\r\nconstrained to propose for its outcome only that which is righteous and of\r\nirreproachable intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The\r\ncause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive and\r\nequality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy\r\nof our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause\r\nwill we battle until the last gun is fired.\r\n\r\nI have spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when it is most\r\nnecessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know that, even\r\nin the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought is of\r\ncarrying the war through to its end, we have not forgotten any ideal or\r\nprinciple for which the name of America has been held in honor among the\r\nnations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great\r\ngenerations that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. The\r\neyes of the people have been opened and they see. The hand of God is laid\r\nupon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only if they\r\nrise to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 2, 1918\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nThe year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my\r\nconstitutional duty to give to the Congress from time to time information\r\non the state of the Union has been so crowded with great events, great\r\nprocesses, and great results that I cannot hope to give you an adequate\r\npicture of its transactions or of the far-reaching changes which have been\r\nwrought of our nation and of the world. You have yourselves witnessed these\r\nthings, as I have. It is too soon to assess them; and we who stand in the\r\nmidst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another\r\ngeneration will be to say what they mean, or even what they have been. But\r\nsome great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute, in a sense,\r\npart of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To state\r\nthem is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which\r\nmust grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine.\r\n\r\nA year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent\r\n1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising, in\r\nMay last, to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307,182, and\r\ncontinuing to reach similar figures in August and September, in August\r\n289,570 and in September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took\r\nplace before, across three thousand miles of sea, followed by adequate\r\nequipment and supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of\r\nattack,-dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard\r\nagainst. In all this movement only seven hundred and fifty-eight men were\r\nlost by enemy attack, six hundred and thirty of whom were upon a single\r\nEnglish transport which was sunk near the Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and\r\nmaterial. It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting\r\norganization of the industries of the country and of all its productive\r\nactivities more complete, more thorough in method and effective in result,\r\nmore spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great\r\nbelligerent had been able to effect. We profited greatly by the experience\r\nof the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years in the\r\nexigent and exacting business, their every resource and every executive\r\nproficiency taxed to the utmost. We were their pupils. But we learned\r\nquickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of cooperation that\r\njustify our great pride that we were able to serve the world with\r\nunparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation,\r\nsupply, equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and\r\nquality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept\r\nthe seas, and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers\r\nor sailors ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle\r\nor acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put\r\nto the test. Those of us who played some part in directing the great\r\nprocesses by which the war was pushed irresistibly forward to the final\r\ntriumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of\r\nwhat our men did. Their officers understood the grim and exacting task they\r\nhad undertaken and performed it with an audacity, efficiency, and\r\nunhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with\r\nimperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great\r\nor small, from their great chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to the youngest\r\nlieutenant; and their men were worthy of them,-such men as hardly need to\r\nbe commanded, and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the\r\nquick intelligence of those who know just what it is they would accomplish.\r\nI am proud to be the fellow-countryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those\r\nof us who stayed at home did our duty; the war could not have been won or\r\nthe gallant men who fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise;\r\nbut for many a long day we shall think ourselves \"accurs'd we were not\r\nthere, and hold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought\" with these\r\nat St. Mihiel or Thierry. The memory of those days of triumphant battle\r\nwill go with these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his\r\nfavorite memory. \"Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but hell\r\nremember with advantages what feats he did that day!\"\r\n\r\nWhat we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in\r\nforce into the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole\r\nfate of the world seemed to hang in the balance and threw their fresh\r\nstrength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep\r\nof the fateful struggle,-turn it once for all, so that thenceforth it was\r\nback, back, back for their enemies, always back, never again forward! After\r\nthat it was only a scant four months before the commanders of the Central\r\nEmpires knew themselves beaten; and now their very empires are in\r\nliquidation!\r\n\r\nAnd throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation was: what unity of\r\npurpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through all its\r\nsplendid display of strength, its untiring accomplishment! I have said that\r\nthose of us who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply\r\nwill always wish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our\r\nlabor; but we can never be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to be\r\nhere in the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private\r\ninterest of their own and devoted the whole of their trained capacity to\r\nthe tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking! The\r\npatriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished\r\ncapacity that marked their toilsome labors, day after day, month after\r\nmonth, have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in the trenches and\r\non the sea. And not the men here in Washington only. They have but directed\r\nthe vast achievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable\r\nfarms, in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines,\r\nwherever the stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the\r\nshipyards, on the railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every labor that\r\nwas needed to sustain the battle lines, men have vied with each other to do\r\ntheir part and do it well. They can look any man-at-arms in the face, and\r\nsay, We also strove to win and gave the best that was in us to make our\r\nfleets and armies sure of their triumph!\r\n\r\nAnd what shall we say of the women,-of their instant intelligence,\r\nquickening every task that they touched; their capacity for organization\r\nand cooperation, which gave their action discipline and enhanced the\r\neffectiveness of everything they attempted; their aptitude at tasks to\r\nwhich they had never before set their hands; their utter self-sacrifice\r\nalike in what they did and in what they gave? Their contribution to the\r\ngreat result is beyond appraisal. They have added a new lustre to the\r\nannals of American womanhood.\r\n\r\nThe least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in\r\npolitical rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field\r\nof practical work they have entered, whether for themselves or for their\r\ncountry. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred\r\nwere we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense practical services\r\nthey have rendered the women of the country have been the moving spirits in\r\nthe systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted to\r\nsupply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon every front\r\nwith food and everything else that we had that might serve the common\r\ncause. The details of such a story can never be fully written, but we carry\r\nthem at our hearts and thank God that we can say that we are the kinsmen of\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was\r\nmade. It has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and\r\ninspiration of these days of achievement quick within us, we turn to the\r\ntasks of peace again,-a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible\r\nmonarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready for a new order,\r\nfor new foundations of justice and fair dealing.\r\n\r\nWe are about to give order and organization to this peace not only for\r\nourselves but for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as they\r\nwill suffer us to serve them. It is international justice that we seek, not\r\ndomestic safety merely. Our thoughts have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon\r\nAsia, upon the near and the far East, very little upon the acts of peace\r\nand accommodation that wait to be performed at our own doors. While we are\r\nadjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital\r\nimportance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with\r\nour immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel? I\r\nhope that the members of the Senate will permit me to speak once more of\r\nthe unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment with the Republic of\r\nColombia. I very earnestly urge upon them an early and favorable action\r\nupon that vital matter. I believe that they will feel, with me, that the\r\nstage of affairs is now set for such action as will be not only just but\r\ngenerous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nSo far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to\r\npeace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That problem is\r\nless serious for us than it may turn out too he for the nations which have\r\nsuffered the disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we. Our\r\npeople, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led. They know their own\r\nbusiness, are quick and resourceful at every readjustment, definite in\r\npurpose, and self-reliant in action. Any leading strings we might seek to\r\nput them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled because they would pay\r\nno attention to them and go their own way. All that we can do as their\r\nlegislative and executive servants is to mediate the process of change\r\nhere, there, and elsewhere as we may. I have heard much counsel as to the\r\nplans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy\r\nconsummation, but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme of\r\n\"reconstruction\" emerge which I thought it likely we could force our\r\nspirited business men and self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy\r\nand obedience.\r\n\r\nWhile the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the\r\nindustries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to\r\nrender, by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials\r\nneeded, by which to check undertakings that could for the time be dispensed\r\nwith and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war, by which to\r\ngain for the purchasing departments of the Government a certain control\r\nover the prices of essential articles and materials, by which to restrain\r\ntrade with alien enemies, make the most of the available shipping, and\r\nsystematize financial transactions, both public and private, so that there\r\nwould be no unnecessary conflict or confusion,-by which, in short, to put\r\nevery material energy of the country in harness to draw the common load\r\nand make of us one team in the accomplishment of a great task. But the\r\nmoment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off.\r\nRaw materials upon which the Government had kept its hand for fear there\r\nshould not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been\r\nreleased and put into the general market again. Great industrial plants\r\nwhose whole output and machinery had been taken over for the uses of the\r\nGovernment have been set free to return to the uses to which they were put\r\nbefore the war. It has not been possible to remove so readily or so quickly\r\nthe control of foodstuffs and of shipping, because the world has still to\r\nbe fed from our granaries and the ships are still needed to send supplies\r\nto our men overseas and to bring the men back as fast as the disturbed\r\nconditions on the other side of the water permit; but even there restraints\r\nare being relaxed as much as possible and more and more as the weeks go by.\r\n\r\nNever before have there been agencies in existence in this country which\r\nknew so much of the field of supply, of labor, and of industry as the War\r\nIndustries Board, the War Trade Board, the Labor Department, the Food\r\nAdministration, and the Fuel Administration have known since their labors\r\nbecame thoroughly systematized; and they have not been isolated agencies;\r\nthey have been directed by men who represented the permanent Departments of\r\nthe Government and so have been the centres of unified and cooperative\r\naction. It has been the policy of the Executive, therefore, since the\r\narmistice was assured (which is in effect a complete submission of the\r\nenemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the business\r\nmen of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point\r\nand in every matter where it was desired. It is surprising how fast the\r\nprocess of return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the\r\nfighting stopped. It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted\r\nand any aid that may be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any\r\nbetter than it will direct itself. The American business man is of quick\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not, however,\r\nprovide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning armies.\r\nThose who are of trained capacity, those who are skilled workmen, those who\r\nhave acquired familiarity with established businesses, those who are ready\r\nand willing to go to the farms, all those whose aptitudes are known or will\r\nbe sought out by employers will find no difficulty, it is safe to say, in\r\nfinding place and employment. But there will be others who will be at a\r\nloss where to gain a livelihood unless pains are taken to guide them and\r\nput them in the way of work. There will be a large floating residuum of\r\nlabor which should not be left wholly to shift for itself. It seems to me\r\nimportant, therefore, that the development of public works of every sort\r\nshould be promptly resumed, in order that opportunities should be created\r\nfor unskilled labor in particular, and that plans should be made for such\r\ndevelopments of our unused lands and our natural resources as we have\r\nhitherto lacked stimulation to undertake.\r\n\r\nI particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the\r\nSecretary of the Interior has developed in his annual report and before\r\nyour Committees for the reclamation of arid, swamp, and cutover lands which\r\nmight, if the States were willing and able to cooperate, redeem some three\r\nhundred million acres of land for cultivation. There are said to be fifteen\r\nor twenty million acres of land in the West, at present arid, for whose\r\nreclamation water is available, if properly conserved. There are about two\r\nhundred and thirty million acres from which the forests have been cut but\r\nwhich have never yet been cleared for the plow and which lie waste and\r\ndesolate. These lie scattered all over the Union. And there are nearly\r\neighty million acres of land that lie under swamps or subject to periodical\r\noverflow or too wet for anything but grazing, which it is perfectly\r\nfeasible to drain and protect and redeem. The Congress can at once direct\r\nthousands of the returning soldiers to the reclamation of the arid lands\r\nwhich it has already undertaken, if it will but enlarge the plans and\r\nappropriations which it has entrusted to the Department of the Interior. It\r\nis possible in dealing with our unused land to effect a great rural and\r\nagricultural development which will afford the best sort of opportunity to\r\nmen who want to help themselves and the Secretary of the Interior has\r\nthought the possible methods out in a way which is worthy of your most\r\nfriendly attention.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the control which must yet for a while, perhaps for a long\r\nlong while, be exercised over shipping because of the priority of service\r\nto which our forces overseas are entitled and which should also be accorded\r\nthe shipments which are to save recently liberated peoples from starvation\r\nand many devastated regions from permanent ruin. May I not say a special\r\nword about the needs of Belgium and northern France? No sums of money paid\r\nby way of indemnity will serve of themselves to save them from hopeless\r\ndisadvantage for years to come. Something more must be done than merely\r\nfind the money. If they had money and raw materials in abundance to-morrow\r\nthey could not resume their place in the industry of the world\r\nto-morrow,-the very important place they held before the flame of war swept\r\nacross them. Many of their factories are razed to the ground. Much of their\r\nmachinery is destroyed or has been taken away. Their people are scattered\r\nand many of their best workmen are dead. Their markets will be taken by\r\nothers, if they are not in some special way assisted to rebuild their\r\nfactories and replace their lost instruments of manufacture. They should\r\nnot be left to the vicissitudes of the sharp competition for materials and\r\nfor industrial facilities which is now to set in. I hope, therefore, that\r\nthe Congress will not be unwilling, if it should become necessary, to grant\r\nto some such agency as the War Trade Board the right to establish\r\npriorities of export and supply for the benefit of these people whom we\r\nhave been so happy to assist in saving from the German terror and whom we\r\nmust not now thoughtlessly leave to shift for themselves in a pitiless\r\ncompetitive market.\r\n\r\nFor the steadying, and facilitation of our own domestic business\r\nreadjustments nothing is more important than the immediate determination of\r\nthe taxes that are to be levied for 1918, 1919, and 1920. As much of the\r\nburden of taxation must be lifted from business as sound methods of\r\nfinancing the Government will permit, and those who conduct the great\r\nessential industries of the country must be told as exactly as possible\r\nwhat obligations to the Government they will be expected to meet in the\r\nyears immediately ahead of them. It will be of serious consequence to the\r\ncountry to delay removing all uncertainties in this matter a single day\r\nlonger than the right processes of debate justify. It is idle to talk of\r\nsuccessful and confident business reconstruction before those uncertainties\r\nare resolved.\r\n\r\nIf the war had continued it would have been necessary to raise at least\r\neight billion dollars by taxation payable in the year 1919; but the war has\r\nended and I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that it will be safe\r\nto reduce the amount to six billions. An immediate rapid decline in the\r\nexpenses of the Government is not to be looked for. Contracts made for war\r\nsupplies will, indeed, be rapidly cancelled and liquidated, but their\r\nimmediate liquidation will make heavy drains on the Treasury for the months\r\njust ahead of us. The maintenance of our forces on the other side of the\r\nsea is still necessary. A considerable proportion of those forces must\r\nremain in Europe during the period of occupation, and those which are\r\nbrought home will be transported and demobilized at heavy expense for\r\nmonths to come. The interest on our war debt must of course be paid and\r\nprovision made for the retirement of the obligations of the Government\r\nwhich represent it. But these demands will of course fall much below what a\r\ncontinuation of military operations would have entailed and six billions\r\nshould suffice to supply a sound foundation for the financial operations of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nI entirely concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending that\r\nthe two billions needed in addition to the four billions provided by\r\nexisting law be obtained from the profits which have accrued and shall\r\naccrue from war contracts and distinctively war business, but that these\r\ntaxes be confined to the war profits accruing in 1918, or in 1919 from\r\nbusiness originating in war contracts. I urge your acceptance of his\r\nrecommendation that provision be made now, not subsequently, that the taxes\r\nto be paid in 1920 should be reduced from six to four billions. Any\r\narrangements less definite than these would add elements of doubt and\r\nconfusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through which\r\nthe country must now immediately pass, and which no true friend of the\r\nnation's essential business interests can afford to be responsible for\r\ncreating or prolonging. Clearly determined conditions, clearly and simply\r\ncharted, are indispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial\r\ndevelopment which may confidently be expected if we act now and sweep all\r\ninterrogation points away.\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that the Congress will carry out the naval programme\r\nwhich was undertaken before we entered the war. The Secretary of the Navy\r\nhas submitted to your Committees for authorization that part of the\r\nprogramme which covers the building plans of the next three years. These\r\nplans have been prepared along the lines and in accordance with the policy\r\nwhich the Congress established, not under the exceptional conditions of the\r\nwar, but with the intention of adhering to a definite method of development\r\nfor the navy. I earnestly recommend the uninterrupted pursuit of that\r\npolicy. It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt to adjust our\r\nprogrammes to a future world policy as yet undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe question which causes me the greatest concern is the question of the\r\npolicy to be adopted towards the railroads. I frankly turn to you for\r\ncounsel upon it. I have no confident judgment of my own. I do not see how\r\nany thoughtful man can have who knows anything of the complexity of the\r\nproblem. It is a problem which must be studied, studied immediately, and\r\nstudied without bias or prejudice. Nothing can be gained by becoming\r\npartisans of any particular plan of settlement.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that the administration of the railways should be taken\r\nover by the Government so long as the war lasted. It would have been\r\nimpossible otherwise to establish and carry through under a single\r\ndirection the necessary priorities of shipment. It would have been\r\nimpossible otherwise to combine maximum production at the factories and\r\nmines and farms with the maximum possible car supply to take the products\r\nto the ports and markets; impossible to route troop shipments and freight\r\nshipments without regard to the advantage or-disadvantage of the roads\r\nemployed; impossible to subordinate, when necessary, all questions of\r\nconvenience to the public necessity; impossible to give the necessary\r\nfinancial support to the roads from the public treasury. But all these\r\nnecessities have now been served, and the question is, What is best for the\r\nrailroads and for the public in the future?\r\n\r\nExceptional circumstances and exceptional methods of administration were\r\nnot needed to convince us that the railroads were not equal to the immense\r\ntasks of transportation imposed upon them by the rapid and continuous\r\ndevelopment of the industries of the country. We knew that already. And we\r\nknew that they were unequal to it partly because their full cooperation was\r\nrendered impossible by law and their competition made obligatory, so that\r\nit has been impossible to assign to them severally the traffic which could\r\nbest be carried by their respective lines in the interest of expedition and\r\nnational economy.\r\n\r\nWe may hope, I believe, for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by\r\nthe time Spring has come. The twenty-one months to which the present control\r\nof the railways is limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have\r\nbeen made will run at the farthest, I take it for granted, only to the\r\nJanuary of 1921. The full equipment of the railways which the federal\r\nadministration had planned could not be completed within any such period.\r\nThe present law does not permit the use of the revenues of the several\r\nroads for the execution of such plans except by formal contract with their\r\ndirectors, some of whom will consent while some will not, and therefore\r\ndoes not afford sufficient authority to undertake improvements upon the\r\nscale upon which it would be necessary to undertake them. Every approach to\r\nthis difficult subject-matter of decision brings us face to face,\r\ntherefore, with this unanswered question: What is it right that we should\r\ndo with the railroads, in the interest of the public and in fairness to\r\ntheir owners?\r\n\r\nLet me say at once that I have no answer ready. The only thing that is\r\nperfectly clear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the\r\nowners of the railroads to leave the question unanswered and that it will\r\npresently become my duty to relinquish control of the roads, even before\r\nthe expiration of the statutory period, unless there should appear some\r\nclear prospect in the meantime of a legislative solution. Their release\r\nwould at least produce one element of a solution, namely certainty and a\r\nquick stimulation of private initiative.\r\n\r\nI believe that it will be serviceable for me to set forth as explicitly as\r\npossible the alternative courses that lie open to our choice. We can simply\r\nrelease the roads and go back to the old conditions of private management,\r\nunrestricted competition, and multiform regulation by both state and\r\nfederal authorities; or we can go to the opposite extreme and establish\r\ncomplete government control, accompanied, if necessary, by actual\r\ngovernment ownership; or we can adopt an intermediate course of modified\r\nprivate control, under a more unified and affirmative public regulation and\r\nunder such alterations of the law as will permit wasteful competition to be\r\navoided and a considerable degree of unification of administration to be\r\neffected, as, for example, by regional corporations under which the\r\nrailways of definable areas would be in effect combined in single systems.\r\n\r\nThe one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it\r\nwould be a disservice alike to the country and to the owners of the\r\nrailroads to return to the old conditions unmodified. Those are conditions\r\nof restraint without development. There is nothing affirmative or helpful\r\nabout them. What the country chiefly needs is that all its means of\r\ntransportation should be developed, its railways, its waterways, its\r\nhighways, and its countryside roads. Some new element of policy, therefore,\r\nis absolutely necessary--necessary for the service of the public, necessary\r\nfor the release of credit to those who are administering the railways,\r\nnecessary for the protection of their security holders. The old policy may\r\nbe changed much or little, but surely it cannot wisely be left as it was. I\r\nhope that the Con will have a complete and impartial study of the whole\r\nproblem instituted at once and prosecuted as rapidly as possible. I stand\r\nready and anxious to release the roads from the present control and I must\r\ndo so at a very early date if by waiting until the statutory limit of time\r\nis reached I shall be merely prolonging the period of doubt and uncertainty\r\nwhich is hurtful to every interest concerned.\r\n\r\nI welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in\r\nParis the representatives of the governments with which we have been\r\nassociated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace. I realize\r\nthe great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country,\r\nparticularly at this time, but the conclusion that it was my paramount duty\r\nto go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will seem as\r\nconclusive to you as they have seemed to me.\r\n\r\nThe Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to\r\nthe Congress on the eighth of January last, as the Central Empires also\r\nhave, and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their\r\ninterpretation and application, and it is highly desirable that I should\r\ngive it in order that the sincere desire of our Government to contribute\r\nwithout selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will be of common\r\nbenefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully manifest. The peace\r\nsettlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent importance\r\nboth to us and to the rest of the world, and I know of no business or\r\ninterest which should take precedence of them. The gallant men of our armed\r\nforces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they\r\nknew to be the ideals of their country; I have sought to express those\r\nideals; they have accepted my statements of them as the substance of their\r\nown thought and purpose, as the associated governments have accepted them;\r\nI owe it to them to see to it, so far as in me lies, that no false or\r\nmistaken interpretation is put upon them, and no possible effort omitted to\r\nrealize them. It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what\r\nthey offered their life's blood to obtain. I can think of no call to\r\nservice which could transcend this.\r\n\r\nI shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side the water,\r\nand you will know all that I do. At my request, the French and English\r\ngovernments have absolutely removed the censorship of cable news which\r\nuntil within a fortnight they had maintained and there is now no censorship\r\nwhatever exercised at this end except upon attempted trade communications\r\nwith enemy countries. It has been necessary to keep an open wire constantly\r\navailable between Paris and the Department of State and another between\r\nFrance and the Department of War. In order that this might be done with the\r\nleast possible interference with the other uses of the cables, I have\r\ntemporarily taken over the control of both cables in order that they may be\r\nused as a single system. I did so at the advice of the most experienced\r\ncable officials, and I hope that the results will justify my hope that the\r\nnews of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom and with the\r\nleast possible delay from each side of the sea to the other.\r\n\r\nMay I not hope, Gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I\r\nshall have to perform on the other side of the sea, in my efforts truly and\r\nfaithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love,\r\nI may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support?\r\nI realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking; I am\r\npoignantly aware of its grave responsibilities. I am the servant of the\r\nnation. I can have no private thought or purpose of my own in performing\r\nsuch an errand. I go to give the best that is in me to the common\r\nsettlements which I must now assist in arriving at in conference with the\r\nother working heads of the associated governments. I shall count upon your\r\nfriendly countenance and encouragement. I shall not be inaccessible. The\r\ncables and the wireless will render me available for any counsel or service\r\nyou may desire of me, and I shall be happy in the thought that I am\r\nconstantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with which\r\nwe shall have to deal. I shall make my absence as brief as possible and\r\nshall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to\r\ntranslate into action the great ideals for which America has striven.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 2, 1919\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session\r\nof the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as\r\nI could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this\r\ntime. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the\r\nseveral executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in\r\ntheir detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs\r\ngrowing out of Federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later date of\r\naddressing you.\r\n\r\nI hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation\r\nlooking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one\r\nsingle authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that\r\nappropriations should be made not independently of each other, but with\r\nreference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related\r\nto the nation's income, there can be no doubt I believe the burden of\r\npreparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work is to be\r\nproperly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided, rest upon\r\nthe executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved\r\nor amended by a single committee of each House of Congress and no single\r\nappropriation should be made by the Congress, except such as may have been\r\nincluded in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular\r\ncommittee of Congress charged with the budget legislation.\r\n\r\nAnother and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascertainment\r\nof the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are\r\nexpended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of\r\nascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the\r\nappropriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the\r\nmoney has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors\r\nshould be highly trained officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury\r\nDepartment, free of obligations to or motives of consideration for this or\r\nany subsequent administration, and authorized and empowered to examine into\r\nand make report upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the\r\nexecutive departments of the Government. Their reports should be made to\r\nthe Congress and to the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the\r\nproblem of future taxation. Simplification of the income and profits taxes\r\nhas become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed indispensable\r\nservice during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save\r\nthe taxpayer inconvenience and expense, but in order that his liability may\r\nbe made certain and definite.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the details of the Revenue Law, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will lay before you for\r\nyour consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection\r\nwith the administration of the law-recommendations which have my approval\r\nand support. It is of the utmost importance that in dealing with this\r\nmatter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for\r\nthe calendar year 1920 payable in the calendar year 1921. The Congress\r\nmight well consider whether the higher rates of income and profits taxes\r\ncan in peace times be effectively productive of revenue, and whether they\r\nmay not, on the contrary, be destructive of business activity and\r\nproductive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace\r\ntimes high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the\r\nincentive to new enterprises, encourage extravagant expenditures and\r\nproduce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other\r\nattendant evils.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with\r\nreference to the position of America in the world's affairs. The prejudice\r\nand passions engendered by decades of controversy between two schools of\r\npolitical and economic thought,-the one believers in protection of American\r\nindustries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only,-must be\r\nsubordinated to the single consideration of the public interest in the light\r\nof utterly changed conditions. Before the war America was heavily the\r\ndebtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments she had to make\r\nto foreign countries on American securities held abroad, the expenditures\r\nof American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay\r\nto others, about balanced the value of her pre-war favorable balance of\r\ntrade. During the war America's exports have been greatly stimulated, and\r\nincreased prices have increased their value. On the other hand, she has\r\npurchased a large proportion of the American securities previously held\r\nabroad, has loaned some $9,000,000,000 to foreign governments, and has\r\nbuilt her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly\r\nincreased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting it\r\nheretofore existing. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the\r\nfavorable balance of trade in peace times: by imports into this country of\r\ngold or of goods, or by establishing new credits. Europe is in no position\r\nat the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contemplate large\r\nfurther imports of gold into this country without concern. The time has\r\nnearly passed for international governmental loans and it will take time to\r\ndevelop in this country a market for foreign securities. Anything,\r\ntherefore, which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for\r\nour exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the\r\neffect of preventing them from paying for our exports and therefore of\r\npreventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country,\r\ngreatly stimulated by the war, must find an outlet by exports to foreign\r\ncountries, and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevitably\r\ncurtail exports, force curtailment of production, load the banking\r\nmachinery of the country with credits to carry unsold products and produce\r\nindustrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to sell, we must be\r\nprepared to buy. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the\r\nperiod of growth of American business concerning tariff legislation, we\r\nmust now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of\r\nthe fact that American business is full grown and that America is the\r\ngreatest capitalist in the world.\r\n\r\nNo policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of\r\nAmerica. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held\r\nAmerican business as if in a strait-jacket, must yield and give way to the\r\nneeds and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope\r\nand promise for American business, if we will but take advantage of the\r\nopportunities that are ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our\r\nisolation and thrown upon us a great duty and responsibility. The United\r\nStates must share the expanding world market. The United States desires for\r\nitself only equal opportunity with the other nations of the world, and that\r\nthrough the process of friendly cooperation and fair competition the\r\nlegitimate interests of the nations concerned may be successfully and\r\nequitably adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere are other matters of importance upon which I urged action at the last\r\nsession of Congress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is\r\nnot necessary for me again to remind you that there is one immediate and\r\nvery practicable question resulting from the war which we should meet in\r\nthe most liberal spirit. It is a matter of recognition and relief to our\r\nsoldiers. I can do no better than to quote from my last message urging this\r\nvery action:\r\n\r\n\"We must see to it that our returning soldiers are assisted in every\r\npracticable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily\r\nwork of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an\r\nadequate scale the admirable organization created by the Department of\r\nLabor for placing men seeking work; and it can also be done, in at least\r\none very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual\r\nenterprise. The Secretary of the Interior has pointed out the way by which\r\nreturning soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto\r\nundeveloped regions of the country which the Federal Government has already\r\nprepared, or can readily prepare, for cultivation and also on many of the\r\ncutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states;\r\nand I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his\r\nplans shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of tariff legislation, I beg to call your attention to the\r\nstatements contained in my last message urging legislation with reference\r\nto the establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry in America:\r\n\r\n\"Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is\r\nthat of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our complete\r\ndependence upon German supplies before the war made the interruption of\r\ntrade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance. The close relation\r\nbetween the manufacture of dyestuffs, on the one hand, and of explosive and\r\npoisonous gases, on the other, moreover, has given the industry an\r\nexceptional significance and value. Although the United States will gladly\r\nand unhesitatingly join in the programme of international disarmament, it\r\nwill, nevertheless, be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the\r\nsuccessful maintenance of many strong and well-equipped chemical plants.\r\nThe German chemical industry, with which we will be brought into\r\ncompetition, was and may well be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly capable\r\nof exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war the farmer performed a vital and willing service to the\r\nnation. By materially increasing the production of his land, he supplied\r\nAmerica and the Allies with the increased amounts of food necessary to keep\r\ntheir immense armies in the field. He indispensably helped to win the war.\r\nBut there is now scarcely less need of increasing the production in food\r\n-and the necessaries of life. I ask the Congress to consider means of\r\nencouraging effort along these lines. The importance of doing everything\r\npossible to promote production along economical lines, to improve\r\nmarketing, and to make rural life more attractive and healthful, is\r\nobvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the\r\nCongress by the Secretary of Agriculture, to secure the essential facts\r\nrequired for the proper study of this question, through the proposed\r\nenlarged programmes for farm management studies and crop estimates. I would\r\nurge, also, the continuance of Federal participation in the building of\r\ngood roads, under the terms of existing law and under the direction of\r\npresent agencies; the need of further action on the part of the States and\r\nthe Federal Government to preserve and develop our forest resources,\r\nespecially through the practice of better forestry methods on private\r\nholdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better support\r\nfor country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of\r\nstudy along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provision for\r\nsanitation in rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and\r\nmedical facilities in these localities. Perhaps the way might be cleared\r\nfor many of these desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensive survey made\r\nof rural conditions by a conference composed of representatives of the\r\nfarmers and of the agricultural agencies responsible for leadership.\r\n\r\nI would call your attention to the widespread condition of political\r\nrestlessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various\r\nand complicated, are superficial rather than deep-seated. Broadly, they\r\narise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our Government\r\nto arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to\r\nnormal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething\r\nEuropean centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering resulting\r\nin the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of\r\npassionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions,\r\nthis unrest will rapidly disappear. In the meantime, it does much evil. It\r\nseems to me that in dealing with this situation Congress should not be\r\nimpatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should\r\nendeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis, with\r\nameliorated living conditions under the minimum of restrictions upon\r\npersonal liberty that is consistent with our reconstruction problems. And\r\nit should arm the Federal Government with power to deal in its criminal\r\ncourts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our\r\ntime-tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the\r\nadvocacy of orderly political change, however fundamental, there must be no\r\ninterference, but towards passion and malevolence tending to incite crime\r\nand insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no\r\nleniency. Legislation to this end has been recommended by the Attorney\r\nGeneral and should be enacted. In this direct connection, I would call your\r\nattention to my recommendations on August 8th, pointing out legislative\r\nmeasures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the\r\npresent cost of living, which contributes so largely to this unrest. On\r\nonly one of these recommendations has the Congress acted. If the\r\nGovernment's campaign is to be effective, it is necessary that the other\r\nsteps suggested should be acted on at once.\r\n\r\nI renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present\r\nFood Control Act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in\r\noperation. The Attorney General has submitted a bill providing for an\r\nextension of this Act for a period of six months. As it now stands, it is\r\nlimited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon\r\nthe formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be\r\nextended at once. The Department of justice has built up extensive\r\nmachinery for the purpose of enforcing its provisions; all of which must be\r\nabandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provisions of this Act\r\nare extended.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make similar\r\npermanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for\r\ninterstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate shipment, if the\r\nrequirements of the law are not compiled with. Some such regulation is\r\nimperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation\r\nof prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life\r\ncannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either\r\nthe necessity of the legitimacy of such measures.\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out in my last message, publicity can accomplish a great deal\r\nin this campaign. The aims of the Government must be clearly brought to the\r\nattention of the consuming public, civic organizations and state officials,\r\nwho are in a position to lend their assistance to our efforts. You have\r\nmade available funds with which to carry on this campaign, but there is no\r\nprovision in the law authorizing their expenditure for the purpose of\r\nmaking the public fully informed about the efforts of the Government.\r\nSpecific recommendation has been made by the Attorney General in this\r\nregard. I would strongly urge upon you its immediate adoption, as it\r\nconstitutes one of the preliminary steps to this campaign.\r\n\r\nI also renew my recommendation that the Congress pass a law regulating cold\r\nstorage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the State of New\r\nJersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage,\r\nprescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted\r\nperiod, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases\r\nbear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the\r\nserviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were\r\nalso prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate\r\nshipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market\r\nprice at which they went into storage. By this means the purchaser would\r\nalways be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or\r\nthe wholesale dealer.\r\n\r\nI would also renew my recommendation that all goods destined for interstate\r\ncommerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it\r\npossible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of\r\nthe producer.\r\n\r\nWe should formulate a law requiring a Federal license of all corporations\r\nengaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license or in the\r\nconditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to\r\nsecure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method\r\nof marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other\r\nmuch needed reforms in the business of interstate shipment and in the\r\nmethods of corporations which are engaged in it; but for the moment I\r\nconfine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to\r\nlower the cost of living.\r\n\r\nNo one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to\r\nnote the absolute need of a definite programme to bring about an\r\nimprovement in the conditions of labor. There can be no settled conditions\r\nleading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if\r\nlabor and capital are to be antagonists instead of partners. Sound thinking\r\nand an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation, as\r\ndistinguished from the interests of a class, must be applied to the\r\nsolution of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other nations\r\nto consider this matter in a vigorous way has produced bitterness and\r\njealousies and antagonisms, the food of radicalism. The only way to keep\r\nmen from agitating against grievances is to remove the grievances. An\r\nunwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction\r\nand gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to\r\nstir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a\r\ncourse of retaliation and repression. The seed of revolution is repression.\r\nThe remedy for these things must not be negative in character. It must be\r\nconstructive. It must comprehend the general interest. The real antidote\r\nfor the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression, but a deep\r\nconsideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the\r\napplication of a remedy.\r\n\r\nCongress has already shown its willingness to deal with these industrial\r\nwrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of\r\nlabor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served\r\nthe whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving\r\nand safeguarding lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now help\r\nin the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine\r\ndemocratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right\r\nof those who work, in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in\r\nevery decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this\r\npurpose in mind that I called a conference to meet in Washington on\r\nDecember 1st, to consider these problems in all their broad aspects, with\r\nthe idea of bringing about a better understanding between these two\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand\r\nfor an immediate consideration of the difficulties between capital and\r\nlabor, bids us put our own house in order. Frankly, there can be no\r\npermanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor which do not\r\nrecognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been struggling\r\nthrough the years. The whole world gave its recognition and endorsement to\r\nthese fundamental purposes in the League of Notions. The statesmen gathered\r\nat Versailles recognized the fact that world stability could not be had by\r\nreverting to industrial standards and conditions against which the average\r\nworkman of the world had revolted. It is, therefore, the task of the states\r\nmen of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world\r\nconditions and to seek to bring about, through legislation, conditions that\r\nwill mean the ending of age-long antagonisms between capital and labor and\r\nthat will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will\r\nresult not only in greater contentment among the mass of workmen but also\r\nbring about a greater production and a greater prosperity to business\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo analyze the particulars in the demands of labor is to admit the justice\r\nof their complaint in many matters that lie at their basis. The workman\r\ndemands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live in comfort,\r\nunhampered by the fear of poverty and want in his old age. He demands the\r\nright to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surroundings, both in\r\nhome and in workshop, surroundings that develop and do not retard his own\r\nhealth and wellbeing; and the right to provide for his children's wants in\r\nthe matter of health and education. In other words, it is his desire to\r\nmake the conditions of his life and the lives of those dear to him\r\ntolerable and easy to bear.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down ill the\r\ncovenant of the League of Nations offers us the way to industrial peace and\r\nconciliation. No other road lies open to us. Not to pursue this one is\r\nlonger to invite enmities, bitterness, and antagonisms which in the end\r\nonly lead to industrial and social disaster. The unwilling workman is not a\r\nprofitable servant. An employee whose industrial life is hedged about by\r\nhard and unjust conditions, which he did not create and over which he has\r\nno control, lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which\r\nare the necessary ingredients of a great producing entity. Let us be frank\r\nabout this solemn matter. The evidences of world-wide unrest which manifest\r\nthemselves in violence throughout the world bid us pause and consider the\r\nmeans to be found to stop the spread of this contagious thing before it\r\nsaps the very vitality of the nation itself. Do we gain strength by\r\nwithholding the remedy? Or is it not the business of statesmen to treat\r\nthese manifestations of unrest which meet us on every hand as evidences of\r\nan economic disorder and to apply constructive remedies wherever necessary,\r\nbeing sure that in the application of the remedy we touch not the vital\r\ntissues of our industrial and economic life? There can be no recession of\r\nthe tide of unrest until constructive instrumentalities are set up to stem\r\nthat tide.\r\n\r\nGovernments must recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for\r\nhumane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of\r\nthose engaged in all industries. Labor must not be longer treated as a\r\ncommodity. It must be regarded as the activity of human beings, possessed\r\nof deep yearnings and desires. The business man gives his best thought to\r\nthe repair and replenishment of his machinery, so that its usefulness will\r\nnot be impaired and its power to produce may always be at its height and\r\nkept in full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to be paid to the human\r\nmachine, which after all propels the machinery of the world and is the\r\ngreat dynamic force that lies back of all industry and progress. Return to\r\nthe old standards of wage and industry in employment are unthinkable. The\r\nterrible tragedy of war which has just ended and which has brought the\r\nworld to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should\r\nensue a return to the conditions of the past. Europe itself, whence has\r\ncome the unrest which now holds the world at bay, is an example of\r\nstandpatism in these vital human matters which America might well accept as\r\nan example, not to be followed but studiously to be avoided. Europe made\r\nlabor the differential, and the price of it all is enmity and antagonism\r\nand prostrated industry, The right of labor to live in peace and comfort\r\nmust be recognized by governments and America should be the first to lay\r\nthe foundation stones upon which industrial peace shall be built.\r\n\r\nLabor not only is entitled to an adequate wage, but capital should receive\r\na reasonable return upon its investment and is entitled to protection at\r\nthe hands of the Government in every emergency. No Government worthy of the\r\nname can \"play\" these elements against each other, for there is a mutuality\r\nof interest between them which the Government must seek to express and to\r\nsafeguard at all cost.\r\n\r\nThe right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be\r\ninterfered with by any process of Government, but there is a predominant\r\nright and that is the right of the Government to protect all of its people\r\nand to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class. The\r\nGovernment, when it asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize a class but\r\nsimply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable\r\nharm and injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a\r\npower that only Government itself has a right to exercise as a protection\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of international disputes which have led to war, statesmen\r\nhave sought to set up as a remedy arbitration for war. Does this not point\r\nthe way for the settlement of industrial disputes, by the establishment of\r\na tribunal, fair and just alike to all, which will settle industrial\r\ndisputes which in the past have led to war and disaster? America,\r\nwitnessing the evil consequences which have followed out of such disputes\r\nbetween these contending forces, must not admit itself impotent to deal\r\nwith these matters by means of peaceful processes. Surely, there must be\r\nsome method of bringing together in a council of peace and amity these two\r\ngreat interests, out of which will come a happier day of peace and\r\ncooperation, a day that will make men more hopeful and enthusiastic in\r\ntheir various tasks, that will make for more comfort and happiness in\r\nliving and a more tolerable condition among all classes of men. Certainly\r\nhuman intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjusting the\r\ndifferences between capital and labor.\r\n\r\nThis is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and\r\nstrength, and the indomitable courage of her soldiers, she demonstrated her\r\npower to vindicate on foreign battlefields her conceptions of liberty and\r\njustice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be\r\nweakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern\r\nbe proclaimed to the world. There are those in this country who threaten\r\ndirect action to force their will, upon a majority. Russia today, with its\r\nblood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the power of minorities. It\r\nmakes little difference what minority it is; whether capital or labor, or\r\nany other class; no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate\r\nthis country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We are a\r\ndemocracy, where the majority are the masters, or all the hopes and\r\npurposes of the men who founded this government have been defeated and\r\nforgotten. In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be\r\naccomplished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is through\r\nthe orderly processes of representative government. Those who would propose\r\nany other method of reform are enemies of this country. America will not be\r\ndaunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness in these distressing\r\ntimes. We can afford, in the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be\r\nself-contained and sure. The instrument of all reform in America is the\r\nballot. The road to economic and social reform in America is the straight\r\nroad of justice to all classes and conditions of men. Men have but to\r\nfollow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and\r\npurposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and\r\nrevolution. The right road is the road of justice and orderly process.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWoodrow Wilson\r\nDecember 7, 1920\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nWhen I addressed myself to performing the duty laid upon the President by\r\nthe Constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the\r\nUnion, I found my thought dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham\r\nLincoln's--\"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let\r\nus dare to do our duty as we understand it\"--a sentence immortal because it\r\nembodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of\r\nthe nation, the faith in which it was conceived, and the faith in which it\r\nhas grown to glory and power. With that faith and the birth of a nation\r\nfounded upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail\r\nthroughout the affairs of mankind, an order in which reason and right would\r\ntake precedence over covetousness and force; and I believe that I express\r\nthe wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this\r\nsentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike\r\nin the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence\r\nupon the affairs of the world.\r\n\r\nBy this faith, and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its\r\npresent confusion and despair. It was this faith which prevailed over the\r\nwicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of\r\nthe war came when the German people found themselves face to face with the\r\nconscience of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed\r\nagainst the wrong that their government was attempting to perpetrate. I\r\nthink, therefore, that it is true to say that this was the faith which won\r\nthe war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went into\r\nthe field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory.\r\n\r\nThis is the mission upon which Democracy came into the world. Democracy is\r\nan assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated\r\njustly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individuals\r\nto make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality\r\namong his fellows in the matter of right or privilege; and I think we all\r\nrealize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final\r\ntest. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the\r\nprinciple of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as\r\nasserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the\r\nmultitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its\r\npurity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest\r\ndestiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which the United States can assist to accomplish this\r\ngreat object. First, by offering the example within her own borders of the\r\nwill and power of Democracy to make and enforce laws which are\r\nunquestionably just and which are equal in their administration-laws which\r\nsecure its full right to Labor and yet at the same time safeguard the\r\nintegrity of property, and particularly of that property which is devoted\r\nto the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of\r\nthe world. Second, by standing for right and justice as toward individual\r\nnations. The law of Democracy is for the protection of the weak, and the\r\ninfluence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of\r\nthe weak nation, the nation which is struggling toward its right and toward\r\nits proper recognition and privilege in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nThe United States cannot refuse this role of champion without putting the\r\nstigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought its\r\ngovernment into existence and established it in the face of almost\r\nuniversal opposition and intrigue, even in the face of wanton force, as,\r\nfor example, against the Orders in Council of Great Britain and the\r\narbitrary Napoleonic decrees which involved us in what we know as the War\r\nof 1812.\r\n\r\nI urge you to consider that the display of an immediate disposition on the\r\npart of the Congress to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown\r\nthemselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual offset\r\nto the forces of chaos and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part\r\nin the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The\r\nUnited States is of necessity the sample democracy of the world, and the\r\ntriumph of Democracy depends upon its success.\r\n\r\nRecovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late\r\nwar has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water, and has given\r\npromise, I venture-to say, of early completion only in our own fortunate\r\ncountry; but even with us the recovery halts and is impeded at times, and\r\nthere are immediately serviceable acts of legislation which it seems to me\r\nwe ought to attempt, to assist that recovery and prove the indestructible\r\nrecuperative force of a great government of the people. One of these is to\r\nprove that a great democracy can keep house as successfully and in as\r\nbusiness-like a fashion as any other government. It seems to me that the\r\nfirst step toward providing this is to supply ourselves with a systematic\r\nmethod of handling our estimates and expenditures and bringing them to the\r\npoint where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our income or\r\nnecessitate unreasonable taxation; in other words, a workable budget\r\nsystem. And I respectfully suggest that two elements are essential to such\r\na system-namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be in\r\nthe hands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee in\r\neach house of the Congress, but also that this body should be brought into\r\nsuch cooperation with the Departments of the Government and with the\r\nTreasury of the United States as would enable it to act upon a complete\r\nconspectus of the needs of the Government and the resources from which it\r\nmust draw its income.\r\n\r\nI reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed by the last session of the\r\nCongress because of a constitutional objection. The House of\r\nRepresentatives subsequently modified the bill in order to meet this\r\nobjection. In the revised form, I believe that the bill, coupled with\r\naction already taken by the Congress to revise its rules and procedure,\r\nfurnishes the foundation for an effective national budget system. I\r\nearnestly hope, therefore, that one of the first steps to be taken by the\r\npresent session of the Congress will be to pass the budget bill.\r\n\r\nThe nation's finances have shown marked improvement during the last year.\r\nThe total ordinary receipts of $6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920\r\nexceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,000,000, while the total net ordinary\r\nexpenditures decreased from $18,514,000,000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross\r\npublic debt, which reached its highest point on August 31, 1919, when it\r\nwas $26,596,000,000, had dropped on November 30, 1920, to $24,175,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere has also been a marked decrease in holdings of government war\r\nsecurities by the banking institutions of the country, as well as in the\r\namount of bills held by the Federal Reserve Banks secured by government war\r\nobligations. This fortunate result has relieved the banks and left them\r\nfreer to finance the needs of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce. It has\r\nbeen due in large part to the reduction of the public debt, especially of\r\nthe floating debt, but more particularly to the improved distribution of\r\ngovernment securities among permanent investors. The cessation of the\r\nGovernment's borrowings, except through short-term certificates of\r\nindebtedness, has been a matter of great consequence to the people of the\r\ncountry at large, as well as to the holders of Liberty Bonds and Victory\r\nNotes, and has had an important bearing on the matter of effective credit\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the\r\nTreasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant\r\ninfluence in that market. The future course will necessarily depend upon\r\nthe extent to which economies are practiced and upon the burdens placed\r\nupon the Treasury, as well as upon industrial developments and the\r\nmaintenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high level. The fundamental\r\nfact which at present dominates the Government's financial situation is\r\nthat seven and a half billions of its war indebtedness mature within the\r\nnext two and a half years. Of this amount, two and a half billions are\r\nfloating debt and five billions, Victory Notes and War. Savings\r\nCertificates. The fiscal program of the Government must be determined with\r\nreference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that Government\r\nexpenditures be reduced to the lowest amount which will permit the various\r\nservices to operate efficiently and that Government receipts from taxes and\r\nsalvage be maintained sufficiently high to provide for current\r\nrequirements, including interest and sinking fund charges on the public\r\ndebt, and at the same time retire the floating debt and part of the Victory\r\nLoan before maturity.\r\n\r\nWith rigid economy, vigorous salvage operations, and adequate revenues from\r\ntaxation, a surplus of current receipts over current expenditures can be\r\nrealized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the\r\nGovernment should cooperate to see that this program is realized. I cannot\r\noveremphasize the necessity of economy in Government appropriations and\r\nexpenditures and the avoidance by the Congress of practices which take\r\nmoney from the Treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriations. The\r\nestimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of\r\nexpenditures were authorized by the last Congress in addition to the\r\namounts shown in the usual compiled statements of appropriations. This\r\nstrikingly illustrates the importance of making direct and specific\r\nappropriations. The relation between the current receipts and current\r\nexpenditures of the Government during the present fiscal year, as well as\r\nduring the last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the\r\nextraordinary burdens thrown upon the Treasury by the Transportation Act,\r\nin connection with the return of the railroads to private control. Over\r\n$600,000,000 has already been paid to the railroads under this\r\nact-$350,000,000 during the present fiscal year; and it is estimated that\r\nfurther payments aggregating possibly $650,000,000 must still be made to\r\nthe railroads during the current year. It is obvious that these large\r\npayments have already seriously limited the Government's progress in\r\nretiring the floating debt.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this, it seems to me, is the necessity for an\r\nimmediate consideration of the revision of our tax laws. Simplification of\r\nthe income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes\r\nperformed an indispensable service during the war. The need for their\r\nsimplification, however, is very great, in order to save the taxpayer\r\ninconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain\r\nand definite. Other and more detailed recommendations with regard to taxes\r\nwill no doubt be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is my privilege to draw to the attention of Congress for very\r\nsympathetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for\r\nthe care and treatment of former members of the military and naval forces\r\nwho are sick and disabled as the result of their participation in the war.\r\nThese heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they\r\npatriotically rendered the nation. Their reward will lie rather in\r\nrealization of the fact that they vindicated the rights of their country\r\nand aided in safeguarding civilization. The nation's gratitude must be\r\neffectively revealed to them by the most ample provision for their medical\r\ncare and treatment as well as for their vocational training and placement.\r\nThe time has come when a more complete program can be formulated and more\r\nsatisfactorily administered for their treatment and training, and I\r\nearnestly urge that the Congress give the matter its early consideration.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury and the Board for Vocational Education will\r\noutline in their annual reports proposals covering medical care and\r\nrehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study and commend\r\nyour most generous support.\r\n\r\nPermit me to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain matters\r\nupon which I dwelt at some length in my message to the second session of\r\nthe Sixty-sixth Congress. The necessity, for example, of encouraging the\r\nmanufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals; the importance of doing\r\neverything possible to promote agricultural production along economic\r\nlines, to improve agricultural marketing, and to make rural life more\r\nattractive and healthful; the need for a law regulating cold storage in\r\nsuch a way as to limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage,\r\nprescribing the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted\r\nperiod, and requiring goods released from storage in all cases to bear the\r\ndate of their receipt. It would also be most serviceable if it were\r\nprovided that all goods released from cold storage for interstate shipment\r\nshould have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at\r\nwhich they went into storage, in order that the purchaser might be able to\r\nlearn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale\r\ndealer. Indeed, It would be very serviceable to the public if all goods\r\ndestined for interstate commerce were made to carry upon every packing case\r\nwhose form made it possible a plain statement of the price at which they\r\nleft the hands of the producer. I respectfully call your attention also to\r\nthe recommendations of the message referred to with regard to a federal\r\nlicense for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the immediate legislative need of the time is the removal of all\r\nobstacles to the realization of the best ambitions of our people in their\r\nseveral classes of employment and the strengthening of all\r\ninstrumentalities by. which difficulties are to be met and removed and\r\njustice dealt out, whether by law or by some form of mediation and\r\nconciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at present to, suggest\r\nthe detailed and particular methods by which these objects may be attained,\r\nbut I have faith that the inquiries of your several committees will\r\ndiscover the way and the method.\r\n\r\nIn response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion\r\nthroughout the United States, I earnestly suggest that the Congress\r\nauthorize the Treasury of the United States to make to the struggling\r\ngovernment of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the Allied\r\ngovernments during the war, and I would also suggest that it would be\r\ndesirable to provide in the legislation itself that the expenditure of the\r\nmoney thus loaned should be under the supervision of a commission, or at\r\nleast a commissioner, from the United States in order that revolutionary\r\ntendencies within Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan a\r\nfurther tempting opportunity.\r\n\r\nAllow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the\r\nPhilippine Islands have succeeded in maintaining a stable government since\r\nthe last action of the Congress in their behalf, and have thus fulfilled\r\nthe condition set by the Congress as precedent to a consideration of\r\ngranting independence to the Islands. I respectfully submit that this\r\ncondition precedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our\r\nduty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them\r\nthe independence which they so honorably covet.\r\n\r\nI have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations, gentlemen,\r\nas sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred\r\nand which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I\r\nbelieve this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of\r\nall the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether\r\nin America or elsewhere.",
