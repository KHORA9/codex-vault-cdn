LINCOLN, Volume Seven, 1863-1865\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1863\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON THE LOSS OF GENERAL R. H. MILROY'S DIVISION.\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn June last a division was substantially lost at or near Winchester, Va.\r\nAt the time, it was under General Milroy as immediate commander in the\r\nfield, General Schenck as department commander at Baltimore, and General\r\nHalleck as general-in-chief at Washington.\r\n\r\nGeneral Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and\r\nsubsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to\r\ndisobedience of orders, and reported the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the\r\njudge-advocate-general's conclusions. The disaster, when it came, was a\r\nsurprise to all. It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for\r\nsome time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great\r\ndanger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate\r\nwith the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but,\r\nalthough he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively\r\nordered it. General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the\r\nforce at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively\r\norder its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and\r\nprevented the order reaching General Milroy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Milroy seems to have concurred with General Schenck in the opinion\r\nthat the force should be kept at Winchester at least until the approach of\r\ndanger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSome question can be made whether some of General Halleck's dispatches to\r\nGeneral Schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the\r\nforce, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against\r\nGeneral Milroy. In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to\r\nwithdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further\r\norder never reached him.\r\n\r\nSerious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster, and I cannot\r\nsay that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame.\r\nNo court-martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nPrivate and confidential\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:\r\n\r\nThere have recently reached the War Department, and thence been laid\r\nbefore me, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in import and\r\nidentical in object. One of them, addressed to nobody, and without place\r\nor date, but having the signature of (apparently) the writer, is a letter\r\nof eight closely written foolscap pages. The other two are written by\r\na different person, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively,\r\nOctober 12 and 13, 1863, and each inclosing a large number of affidavits.\r\nThe general statements of the whole are that the Federal and State\r\nauthorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the\r\nlatter will all be killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be\r\na change. In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed is named, but\r\nthe affidavits show by name forty-two persons as disloyal who have been\r\narmed. They are as follows: [The names are omitted.]\r\n\r\nA majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service. I believe\r\nit could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more\r\nthan ten times as many captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar\r\noperations in East Tennessee. These papers contain altogether thirty--one\r\nmanuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso, and yet I do not find it\r\nanywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of\r\nbeing disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of\r\nbeing armed by the Federal or State Government. Of course, I have not had\r\ntime to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and\r\nbriefed by others, and the result is as stated. The remarkable fact that\r\nthe actual evil is yet only anticipated--inferred--induces me to suppose I\r\nunderstand the case; but I do not state my impression, because I might\r\nbe mistaken, and because your duty and mine is plain in any event. The\r\nlocality of nearly all this seems to be St. Joseph and Buchanan County.\r\nI wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly on\r\nelection day. Prevent violence from whatever quarter, and see that the\r\nsoldiers themselves do no wrong.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.: If not too inconvenient, please\r\ncome at once and have a personal conversation with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO VICE-PRESIDENT HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nAN ACT TO REGULATE THE DUTIES OF THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\nIN PREPARING FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, that, before the first meeting of\r\nthe next Congress, and of every subsequent Congress, the clerk of the\r\nnext preceding House of Representatives shall make a roll of the\r\nRepresentatives elect, and place thereon the names of all persons, and of\r\nsuch persons only, whose credentials show that they were regularly elected\r\nin accordance with the laws of their States respectively, or the laws of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nApproved March 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES W. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for\r\nthe purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to\r\nshut out proper ones. Iowa, having an entire Union delegation, will be\r\none of the States the attempt will be made, if upon any. The Governor\r\ndoubtless has made out the certificates, and they are already in the\r\nhands of the members. I suggest that they come on with them; but that, for\r\ngreater caution, you, and perhaps Mr. Harlan with you, consult with the\r\nGovernor, and have an additional set made out according to the form on the\r\nother half of this sheet; and still another set, if you can, by studying\r\nthe law, think of a form that in your judgment, promises additional\r\nsecurity, and quietly bring the whole on with you, to be used in case of\r\nnecessity. Let what you do be kept still.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO P. F. LOWE.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. F. F. LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nBelow is an act of Congress, passed last session, intended to exclude\r\napplicants not entitled to seats, but which, there is reason to fear, will\r\nbe used to exclude some who are entitled. Please get with the Governor\r\nand one or two other discreet friends, study the act carefully, and make\r\ncertificates in two or three forms, according to your best judgement,\r\nand have them sent to me, so as to multiply the chances of the delegation\r\ngetting their seats. Let it be done without publicity. Below is a form\r\nwhich may answer for one. If you could procure the same to be done for the\r\nOregon member it might be well.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nMuch obliged for the information about deserters contained in your\r\ndispatch of yesterday, while I have to beg your pardon for troubling you\r\nin regard to some of them, when, as it appears by yours, I had the means\r\nof answering my own questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Provost-Marshal-General has issued no proclamation at all. He has\r\nin no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in New York,\r\nexcept in his letter to Governor Seymour of October 21, which has been\r\npublished in the newspapers of that State. It has not been announced or\r\ndecided in any form by the Provost-Marshal-General, or any one else in\r\nauthority of the Government, that every citizen who has paid his three\r\nhundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again, or\r\nthat towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have\r\nagain to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the\r\nnew conscription, nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be\r\nannounced or decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Auburn, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nNo important news. Details of Hooker's night fight do great credit to his\r\ncommand, and particularly to the Eleventh Corps and Geary's part of the\r\nTwelfth. No discredit on any.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother,\r\nGeneral Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he\r\nwill occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field. My wish, then, is\r\ncompounded of what I believe will be best for the country; and it is that\r\nhe will come here, put his military commission in my hands, take his seat,\r\ngo into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations, help elect the\r\nnominees, and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will\r\nreally support the Government in the war. If the result shall be the\r\nelection of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that position. If not,\r\nlet him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThis will heal a dangerous schism for him. It will relieve him from a\r\ndangerous position or a misunderstanding, as I think he is in danger of\r\nbeing permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a\r\nreal sympathy--the sincere opponents of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by\r\ninsincere time-servers to drive him from the house of his own building. He\r\nis young yet. He has abundant talents--quite enough to occupy all his time\r\nwithout devoting any to temper.\r\n\r\nHe is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to\r\nthe command of a corps, by one so competent to judge as General Sherman,\r\nproves this. In that line he can serve both the country and himself more\r\nprofitably than he could as a member of Congress upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair was my brother instead of\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR BRADFORD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nHis EXCELLENCY A. W. BRADFORD, Governor of Maryland.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Yours of the 31st ult. was received yesterday about noon, and since\r\nthen I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject-matter\r\nof it. At my call General Schenck has attended, and he assures me it is\r\nalmost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on\r\nelection day unless prevented by his provost-guards. He says that at some\r\nof those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket,\r\nunless they have some assurance of protection. This makes the Missouri\r\ncase, of my action in regard to which you express your approval.\r\n\r\nThe remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person\r\noffering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of Maryland.\r\nThis brings us to a difference between Missouri and Maryland. With the\r\nsame reason in both States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the\r\nvoter with reference to the present rebellion, while Maryland has not. For\r\nexample, General Trimble, captured fighting us at Gettysburg, is, without\r\nrecanting his treason, a legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even General\r\nSchenck's order admits him to vote, if he recants upon oath. I think that\r\nis cheap enough. My order in Missouri, which you approve, and General\r\nScherick's order here, reach precisely the same end. Bach assures the\r\nright of voting to all loyal men, and whether a man is loyal, each allows\r\nthat man to fix by his own oath. Your suggestion that nearly all the\r\ncandidates are loyal, I do not think quite meets the case. In this\r\nstruggle for the nation's life, I cannot so confidently rely on those\r\nwhose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when\r\nelected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in the expectation\r\nthat they will prove false.\r\n\r\nNor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to prevent the\r\npersistently disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offense to\r\nMaryland. I think she has her own example for it. If I mistake not, it is\r\nprecisely what General Dix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.\r\n\r\nI revoke the first of the three propositions in General Schenek's General\r\nOrder No. 53; not that it is wrong in principle, but because the military,\r\nbeing of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the\r\nprovision is too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThat, all provost-marshals and other military officers do prevent all\r\ndisturbance and violence at or about the polls, whether offered by such\r\npersons as above described, or by any other person or persons whomsoever.\r\n\r\nThe other two propositions of the order I allow to stand. General Schenek\r\nis fully determined, and has my strict orders besides, that all loyal men\r\nmay vote, and vote for whom they please.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. H. HACKETT\r\n\r\n[Private.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nJAMES H. HACKETT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of October 22d is received, as also was, in\r\ndue course, that of October 3d. I look forward with pleasure to the\r\nfulfillment of the promise made in the former to visit Washington the\r\nfollowing winter and to \"call.\"\r\n\r\nGive yourself no uneasiness on the subject mentioned in that of the 22d.\r\nMy note to you I certainly did not expect to see in print, yet I have not\r\nbeen much shocked by the newspaper comments upon it.\r\n\r\nThose comments constitute a fair specimen of what has occurred to me\r\nthrough life. I have endured a great deal of ridicule, without much\r\nmalice; and have received a great deal of kindness not quite free from\r\nridicule. I am used to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Auburn, N. Y.:\r\n\r\nNothing new. Dispatches up to 12 last night from Chattanooga show all\r\nquiet and doing well. How is your son?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nSamuel Wellers, private in Company B, Forty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers,\r\nwrites that he is to be shot for desertion on the 6th instant. His own\r\nstory is rather a bad one, and yet he tells it so frankly, that I\r\nam somewhat interested in him. Has he been a good soldier except the\r\ndesertion? About how old is he?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE, MANSION WASHINGTON, D. C., November 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nPlease suspend the execution of Samuel Wellers, Forty-ninth Pennsylvania\r\nVolunteers, until further orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, November\r\n9, 1863.4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nHave seen dispatch from General Grant about your loss at Rogersville. Per\r\ncontra, about the same time, Averell and Duffle got considerable advantage\r\nof the enemy at and about Lewisburg, Virginia: and on Saturday, the\r\nseventh, Meade drove the enemy from Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford,\r\ncapturing eight battle-flags, four guns, and over 1800 prisoners, with\r\nvery little loss to himself. Let me hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. G. MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 9, 1863 7.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\r\n\r\nI have seen your dispatches about operations on the Rappahannock on\r\nSaturday, and I wish to say, \"Well done!\" Do the 1500 prisoners reported\r\nby General Sedgwick include the 400 taken by General French, or do the\r\nWhole amount to 1900?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PURCHASED BY FOREIGN NATIONS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the peculiar circumstances and pursuant to the comity\r\ndeemed to be due to friendly powers, any tobacco in the United States\r\nbelonging to the government either of France, Austria, or any other state\r\nwith which this country is at peace, and which tobacco was purchased and\r\npaid for by such government prior to the 4th day of March, 1861, may be\r\nexported from any port of the United States under the supervision and upon\r\nthe responsibility of naval officers of such governments and in conformity\r\nto such regulations as may be presented by the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\n I see a dispatch here from Saint Louis, which is a little difficult\r\nfor me to understand. It says \"General Schofield has refused leave of\r\nabsence to members in military service to attend the legislature. All such\r\nare radical and administration men. The election of two Senators from\r\nthis place on Thursday will probably turn upon this thing.\" what does this\r\nmean? Of course members of the legislation must be allowed to attend its\r\nsessions. But how is there a session before the recent election returns\r\nare in? And how is it to be at \"this place\"--and that is Saint Louis?\r\nPlease inform me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nI believe the Secretary of War has telegraphed you about members of the\r\nlegislation. At all events, allow those in the service to attend the\r\nsession, and we can afterward decide whether they can stay through the\r\nentire session.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO HIRAM BARNEY.\r\n\r\n   [Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. HIRAM BARNEY, New York; I would like an interview with you. Can you\r\nnot come?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. MILDERBORGER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., November 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nJOHN MILDERBORGER, Peru, Ind.:\r\n\r\nI cannot comprehend the object of your dispatch. I do not often decline\r\nseeing people who call upon me, and probably will see you if you call.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM to E. H. AND E. JAMESON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., November 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nE. H. and E. JAMESON, Jefferson City, Mo.:\r\n\r\nYours saying Brown and Henderson are elected Senators is received. I\r\nunderstand this is one and one. If so it is knocking heads together to\r\nsome.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, November 14, 1863. 12.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nI have received and considered your dispatch of yesterday. Of the reports\r\nyou mention, I have not the means of seeing any except your own. Besides\r\nthis, the publication might be improper in view of the court of inquiry\r\nwhich has been ordered. With every disposition, not merely to do justice,\r\nbut to oblige you, I feel constrained to say I think the publications\r\nbetter not be made now.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nWhat is the news?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I expected to see you here at Cabinet meeting, and to say\r\nsomething about going to Gettysburg. There will be a train to take and\r\nreturn us. The time for starting is not yet fixed, but when it shall be I\r\nwill notify you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this\r\ncontinent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or\r\nany nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a\r\ngreat battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that\r\nfield, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that\r\nthat nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we\r\ncan not hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled\r\nhere, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\r\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be\r\ndedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus\r\nfar so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the\r\ngreat task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take\r\nincreased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure\r\nof devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have\r\ndied in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of\r\nfreedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,\r\nshall not perish from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nIf there is a man by the name of King under sentence to be shot, please\r\nsuspend execution till further order, and send record.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. November 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nAn intelligent woman in deep distress, called this morning, saying her\r\nhusband, a lieutenant in the Army of Potomac, was to be shot next Monday\r\nfor desertion, and putting a letter in my hand, upon which I relied for\r\nparticulars, she left without mentioning a name or other particular by\r\nwhich to identify the case. On opening the letter I found it equally\r\nvague, having nothing to identify by, except her own signature, which\r\nseems to be \"Mrs. Anna S. King.\" I could not again find her. If you have\r\na case which you shall think is probably the one intended, please apply my\r\ndispatch of this morning to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO E. P. EVANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nE. P. EVANS, West Union, Adams County, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYours to Governor Chase in behalf of John A Welch is before me. Can there\r\nbe a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to\r\ndesert? I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make. When\r\ndid he desert? when did he write the letters?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Two despatches since I saw you; one not quite so late on\r\nfiring as we had before, but giving the points that Burnside thinks he\r\ncan hold the place, that he is not closely invested, and that he forages\r\nacross the river. The other brings the firing up to 11 A.M. yesterday,\r\nbeing twenty-three hours later than we had before.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 25, 1863. 8.40 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL U.S. GRANT:\r\n\r\nYour despatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here. Well done!\r\nMany thanks to all. Remember Burnside.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. P. KIRKLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nCHARLES P. KIRKLAND, ESQ., New York:\r\n\r\nI have just received and have read your published letter to the HON.\r\nBenjamin R. Curtis. Under the circumstances I may not be the most\r\ncompetent judge, but it appears to me to be a paper of great ability, and\r\nfor the country's sake more than for my own I thank you for it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF UNION SUCCESS IN EAST TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nReliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating\r\nfrom East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the\r\nUnion forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position;\r\nand esteeming this to be of high national consequence, I recommend that\r\nall loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their\r\nplaces of worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God\r\nfor this great advancement of the national cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION. DECEMBER 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided\r\nthat the President \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for\r\noffenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;\" and,\r\n\r\nWhereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of\r\nseveral States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have\r\ncommitted and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been\r\nenacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and\r\nliberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and\r\nalso declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any\r\ntime thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have\r\nparticipated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon\r\nand amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions\r\nas he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon\r\naccords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United\r\nStates has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the\r\nliberation of slaves; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said\r\nrebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to\r\nreinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nTherefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nproclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by\r\nimplication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter\r\nexcepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them,\r\nwith restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in\r\nproperty cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and\r\nupon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath\r\nand thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath\r\nshall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor\r\nand effect following, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"I, ------, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will\r\nhenceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in\r\nlike manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed\r\nduring the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far\r\nas not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully\r\nsupport all proclamations of the President made during the existing\r\nrebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified\r\nor declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me God.\"\r\n\r\nThe persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all\r\nwho are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the\r\nso-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations\r\nunder the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have\r\nbeen military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government\r\nabove the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all\r\nwho left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all\r\nwho resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and\r\nafterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in\r\ntreating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise\r\nthan lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been\r\nfound in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in\r\nany of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of\r\npersons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State\r\nat the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath\r\naforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter\r\nby the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called\r\nact of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State\r\ngovernment which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath,\r\nsuch shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and\r\nthe State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional\r\nprovision which declares that \"the United States shall guarantee to every\r\nState in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each\r\nof them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the\r\nEXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic\r\nviolence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision\r\nwhich may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed\r\npeople of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent\r\nfreedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as\r\na temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\r\nlandless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National\r\nEXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\nAnd it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal\r\nState government in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the\r\nsubdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before the\r\nrebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary\r\nby the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not\r\ncontravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing\r\nthe new State government.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation,\r\nso far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States\r\nwherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained. And\r\nfor the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether\r\nmembers sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats\r\nconstitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to\r\nany extent with the EXECUTIVE. And, still further, that this proclamation\r\nis intended to present the people of the States wherein the national\r\nauthority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been\r\nsubverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State\r\ngovernments may be re-established within said States or in any of them;\r\nand while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest, with\r\nhis present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible\r\nmode would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the city of WASHINGTON, the 8th day of December,\r\nA. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States of America the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--\r\n\r\nAnother year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests, has passed.\r\nFor these, and especially for the improved condition cf our national\r\naffairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.\r\n\r\nWe remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in\r\nforeign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing.\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised\r\ntheir authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from\r\nBritish ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly\r\nvindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the\r\ncontest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of\r\nthe blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and\r\nseveral of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as\r\nfar as was possible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice, and\r\nmutual good-will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by\r\nthe impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and\r\nconfidence of maritime powers.\r\n\r\nThe supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain\r\nfor the suppression of the African slave-trade, made on the 17th day of\r\nFebruary last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It\r\nis believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are\r\nconcerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.\r\n\r\nI shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the\r\nadjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of\r\nthe treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the\r\ncitizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.\r\n\r\nA novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime\r\njurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba,\r\nhas been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in\r\nan amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A\r\nconvention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to\r\nconcur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the\r\nliquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been\r\nheretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters\r\nof Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending controversy between this government and that of Chile\r\ntouching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large\r\namount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been\r\nbrought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians,\r\nto whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject\r\nwas thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate,\r\nand although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as\r\nlarge as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His\r\nMajesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when\r\nintelligence in regard to it reached that country.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying\r\ninto effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been\r\norganized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.\r\n\r\nDifficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in\r\ncourse of amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have\r\nreceived a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have\r\naccredited a minister to that Republic.\r\n\r\nIncidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon\r\nmy attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the\r\nrights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad.\r\nIn regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined\r\nby treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that in\r\nthe event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the\r\nlines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him\r\nas a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country can not\r\nexpect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret\r\nto say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some\r\ninstances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the\r\ngreater part of their lives.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who\r\nhave declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully\r\nnaturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the\r\nfact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof. It has\r\nbeen found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want\r\nof guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by\r\nrequiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or\r\nnaturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the\r\npersons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names might be\r\narranged and printed for general information.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens\r\nof the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the\r\nlaws of their native countries, to which on becoming naturalized here they\r\nat once repair, and though never returning to the United States they still\r\nclaim the interposition of this government as citizens. Many altercations\r\nand great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is\r\ntherefore submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable\r\nto fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing\r\nabroad may claim the interposition of his government.\r\n\r\nThe right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under\r\npretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into\r\nthe military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of\r\nthe law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of\r\nexemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of\r\nalienage.\r\n\r\nIn common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been\r\nbrought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the\r\nhereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy\r\nof the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations.\r\nIt is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties\r\nmay be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the claim of the\r\nminister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by\r\nfire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhich, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of\r\ntelegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an\r\ninternational telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph\r\nbetween this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard\r\nand the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, established with any\r\nreasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the\r\ndiplomatic, military, and naval service.\r\n\r\nThe consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last\r\nCongress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that\r\nit may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue\r\nwhenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful in\r\ndefending American rights. In protecting commercial interests our consuls\r\nhave necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities\r\ngrowing out of the war. These they have for the most part met and\r\ndischarged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly includes\r\nthose consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China,\r\nand other Oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and\r\nextraordinary powers.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the several organized Territories is generally\r\nsatisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been\r\nentirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho,\r\nNew Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore\r\nunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from\r\nthe Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the\r\nexpediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration.\r\nAlthough this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with\r\ngreater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred,\r\nthere is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry,\r\nespecially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as\r\nof the precious metals. While the demand for labor is much increased here,\r\ntens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are\r\nthronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United\r\nStates if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them. It\r\nis easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation\r\nis beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to\r\nreceive the attention and support of the Government.\r\n\r\nInjuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases\r\nhave been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both\r\nat sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States. As\r\nthis government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries\r\nare inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United\r\nStates, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing\r\njudicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may\r\nbe authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character\r\nreferred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law.\r\nConventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been\r\nproposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition\r\nhas yet been received from any.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you\r\nto provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have\r\nbeen rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts, and in other cases\r\nwhere this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and\r\nwhere the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nThe proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the\r\nlaw of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the\r\nincomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not\r\nin strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing\r\ntreaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of\r\nso far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls\r\nas are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments\r\nof their office or from property not situated in the United States, is\r\nsubmitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the\r\nground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in\r\nall other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United\r\nStates, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international\r\ntrade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully\r\nconducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law has proved\r\na valuable support of the public credit, and the general legislation in\r\nrelation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers.\r\nSome amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but no change in\r\ntheir principles or general scope is believed to be needed.\r\n\r\nSince these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury,\r\nincluding the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly met and fully\r\nsatisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more\r\namply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be\r\nadded that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more\r\ncheerfully borne.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, and the\r\naggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the 1st\r\nof July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derived from\r\ncustoms $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, from direct\r\ntax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneous sources\r\n$3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making the aggregate\r\n$901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the civil service\r\n$23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79, for interest on\r\npublic debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department $599,298,600.83, for\r\nthe Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment of funded and temporary\r\ndebt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate $895,796,630.65 and leaving the\r\nbalance of $5,329,044.21. But the payment of funded and temporary debt,\r\nhaving been made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be regarded\r\nas merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely\r\nnominal receipts, and their amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore\r\nbe deducted both from receipts and disbursements. This being done there\r\nremains as actual receipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements\r\n$714,709,995.58, leaving the balance as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three-quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is\r\nsufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will\r\nexhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the\r\nestimates of that officer heretofore submitted while it is confidently\r\nexpected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be\r\nfound very considerably less than has been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\n1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the\r\nGeneral in Chief.\r\n\r\n2. The organization of colored persons into the war service.\r\n\r\n3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of General\r\nHitchcock.\r\n\r\n4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national\r\nforces, detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General.\r\n\r\n5. The organization of the invalid corps, and\r\n\r\n6. The operation of the several departments of the Quartermaster-General,\r\nCommissary-General, Paymaster-General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of\r\nOrdnance, and Surgeon-General.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,\r\nexcept such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content\r\nmyself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year\r\nand throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with\r\nfidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly\r\nincreasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so long a line\r\nit has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From\r\nreturns received at the Navy Department it appears that more than 1,000\r\nvessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted? and that\r\nthe value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over\r\n$13,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe naval force of the United States consists at this time of five hundred\r\nand eighty-eight vessels completed and in the course of completion, and of\r\nthese seventy-five are ironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war\r\ngive an increased interest and importance to the Navy which will probably\r\nextend beyond the war itself.\r\n\r\nThe armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which are\r\nunder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in\r\nnumber those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon for\r\nharbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity\r\nwill be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful\r\nposition on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since\r\nthe introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands\r\neither a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the\r\nestablishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of\r\nmodern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, delay, and\r\npublic injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental\r\nestablishments. The necessity of such a navy-yard, so furnished, at some\r\nsuitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been\r\nbrought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is\r\nagain presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies this\r\ncommunication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to\r\nthis subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval\r\npurposes upon one of the Western rivers. A naval force has been created\r\non those interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within little more\r\nthan two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country\r\nat the commencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and\r\nimportant as have been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy at\r\nthis interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the success\r\nof our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has\r\ncreated a new form of naval power.\r\n\r\nOur country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources\r\nof iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate\r\nvicinity of both, and all available and in close proximity to navigable\r\nwaters. Without the advantage of public works, the resources of the nation\r\nhave been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a Navy\r\nof such magnitude, which has at the very period of its creation rendered\r\nsignal service to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500\r\nmen in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has been\r\naccomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to\r\npromote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of\r\nthe draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning\r\nto affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be\r\nlikely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper\r\nvocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I therefore respectfully\r\nsuggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval services by\r\na definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be\r\nequitable to the communities more especially interested.\r\n\r\nI commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also\r\nthe education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The Naval\r\nAcademy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly\r\nresponsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform.\r\nIn order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of\r\neducated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the\r\nnaval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make\r\nnominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than\r\nat any former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in\r\nbeing able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the\r\nentire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the former\r\nto $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In 1860,\r\nthe year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to\r\n$5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722.19\r\nless that those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of\r\ntransportation has been only about twenty-five per cent, but the annual\r\nexpenditure on account of the same has been reduced thirty-five per cent.\r\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become\r\nself-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe international conference of postal delegates from the principal\r\ncountries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of the\r\nPostmaster-General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and concluded\r\nits deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established by\r\nthe conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between\r\nnations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general\r\nsystem of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage, and\r\ncan not fail to produce beneficial results.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is\r\nherewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation to\r\nthe public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other matters of\r\npublic concern pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of\r\nthe present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres were\r\nsold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead law, and\r\nthe residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties,\r\nfor railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of the\r\npublic lands is largely on the increase.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that\r\nthe people of the United States had a higher and more enduring interest in\r\nthe early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than\r\nin the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. This\r\nopinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the\r\nsubject of our national domain. I may cite as evidence of this the liberal\r\nmeasures adopted in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States\r\nof the overflowed lands within their limits, in order to their being\r\nreclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway\r\ncompanies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of\r\ntheir roads, which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities\r\nfor reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most\r\nsignal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting\r\nhomesteads to actual settlers. Since the 1st day of January last the\r\nbefore-mentioned quantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up\r\nunder its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying\r\nevidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding\r\nthe great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged,\r\nand which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their\r\naccustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor\r\nof those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States.\r\nI doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will,\r\nwithout essentially changing the general features of the system, secure to\r\nthe greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their\r\nhomes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the propriety\r\nof raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain\r\nIndian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been\r\nnegotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional\r\naction of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the\r\npossessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.\r\nIt is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the\r\nestablishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes\r\nas have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying\r\nsettlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative duty to these\r\nwards of the Government demand our anxious and constant attention to their\r\nmaterial well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization, and,\r\nabove all, to that moral training which under the blessing of Divine\r\nProvidence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences,\r\nthe hopes and consolations, of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nI suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our\r\nIndian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The\r\ndetails set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need\r\nfor immediate legislative action.\r\n\r\nI commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the\r\nGovernment in this District to your generous and fostering care.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some\r\nextent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,\r\nhowever, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest\r\nrespectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same\r\nsubject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to\r\nthe President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before\r\nyou. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do\r\nnot entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to\r\nwhat can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this subject by the\r\nactual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under auspices\r\nso favorable to rapid progress and completion. The enlarged navigation\r\nbecomes a palpable need to the great road.\r\n\r\nI transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department\r\nof Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital\r\ninterest of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly\r\ntwenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea,\r\nwith varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced\r\nlimits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,\r\nwas not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections then just\r\npast indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold\r\nand menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents\r\nof pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce\r\nwas suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from\r\nforeign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same\r\nquarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We\r\nhad failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this\r\nsubject. The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September,\r\nwas running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month\r\nlater the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored\r\nmen of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The\r\npolicy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future\r\na new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain\r\nconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil\r\nadministration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect\r\nemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that\r\nthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military\r\nmeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it\r\nmight come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be\r\npresented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and\r\ndoubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take\r\nanother review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and\r\nby the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the\r\nrebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication\r\nbetween them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of\r\ninsurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and\r\nadvocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly\r\nfor emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included\r\nin the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which\r\nthree years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery\r\ninto new Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it\r\nwithin their own limits.\r\n\r\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000\r\nare now in the United States military service, about one-half of which\r\nnumber actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage\r\nof taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places\r\nwhich otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested,\r\nit is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile\r\ninsurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures\r\nof emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have been much\r\ndiscussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such discussion,\r\nthe tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same\r\nmeasures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized, and denounced,\r\nand the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose\r\nofficial duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we\r\nhave the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends\r\nof the Union is past.\r\n\r\nLooking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption\r\nof the national authority within the States wherein that authority has\r\nbeen suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of\r\nwhich is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it\r\nwill appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted beyond what is\r\namply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given,\r\nbut no man is coerced to take it. The man is promised a pardon only\r\nin case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the\r\nExecutive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion,\r\nand this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by\r\njudicial and other authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State government\r\nshall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be\r\nrecognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the\r\nState shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against\r\ninvasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the\r\nUnited States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form\r\nof government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit\r\nand full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State\r\ngovernment set up in this particular way? This section of the Constitution\r\ncontemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to\r\nrepublican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite\r\nand hostile element external to or even within the State, and such are\r\nprecisely the cases with which we are now dealing.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,\r\nconstructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element\r\nagainst whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply\r\nabsurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements,\r\nso as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently\r\nliberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation\r\nof his former unsoundness.\r\n\r\nBut if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political\r\nbody an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nto the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to\r\nslavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the\r\npurpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their\r\nfullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my\r\njudgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they\r\nwere intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever\r\nof power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith. I\r\nmay add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall\r\nnot attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor\r\nshall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that\r\nproclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For these and other\r\nreasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be\r\nincluded in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim\r\nit in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has\r\nclear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms\r\nwhich he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed\r\nalso that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating\r\npower of legislation and supreme judicial decision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable\r\ntemporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of\r\npossibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend\r\nall classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It\r\nis hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be\r\nsomewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this\r\nextent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the\r\nNational Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political\r\nframework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the\r\nhope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and\r\navoid great confusion.\r\n\r\nBut why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset\r\nwith the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be\r\ntaken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for\r\naction, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point--a\r\nplan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of\r\nA? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the General\r\nGovernment here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a plan is\r\npresented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which\r\nthey are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them\r\nto act sooner than they otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThe objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National\r\nExecutive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be\r\nmore safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so shape\r\nthe document as to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that on\r\ncertain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is\r\nnot said that other classes or other terms will never be included. Saying\r\nthat reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it\r\nis not said it will never be accepted in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States\r\nnot included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound\r\ngratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore\r\nso earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain\r\nunchanged and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of\r\naiding these important steps to a great consummation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of other cares, however important we must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power\r\nalone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the\r\ncontested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them.\r\nUntil that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere\r\nwhat is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still be\r\ndirected to the Army and Navy who have thus far borne their harder part so\r\nnobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest\r\nefficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the\r\ngallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom\r\nmore than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom\r\ndisenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. WASHINGTON D. C., December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Captain John Rogers United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks\r\nfrom Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the\r\nengagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer Fingal, alias Atlanta,\r\nwhilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer Weehawken, which\r\nled to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also for the zeal, bravery,\r\nand general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE. WASHINGTON, D. C., December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nCongress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th\r\nFebruary, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D. D. Porter \"for the\r\nbravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the\r\n10th January, 1863,\" and in consideration of those services, together with\r\nhis efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the\r\nefforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and\r\nthe important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led\r\nto the surrender of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nI do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved\r\n16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in\r\nthe Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that your lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now\r\nsecure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command, my more than\r\nthanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and perseverance\r\nwith which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected that\r\nimportant object. God bless you all!\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 9, 1863\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY A. G. CURTIN,\r\n\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have to urge my illness, and the preparation of the message,\r\nin excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the\r\nSecretary of War and Provost Marshal General in response to yours in\r\nrelation to recruiting in Pennsylvania. Though not quite as you desire, I\r\nhope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you. Allow me\r\nto exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your\r\ndepartment until further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nLieut. Col. James B. Knox, Tenth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves, offers\r\nhis resignation under circumstances inducing me to wish to accept it. But\r\nI prefer to know your pleasure upon the subject. Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, December 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. OGDEN HOFFMAN, U. S. District Judge, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThe oath in the proclamation of December 8 is intended for those who may\r\nvoluntarily take it, and not for those who may be constrained to take it\r\nin order to escape actual imprisonment or punishment. It is intended that\r\nthe latter class shall abide the granting or withholding of the pardoning\r\npower in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MARY GONYEAG.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARY GONYEAG, Superior, Academy of Visitation, Keokuk, Iowa:\r\n\r\nThe President has no authority as to whether you may raffle for the\r\nbenevolent object you mention. If there is no objection in the Iowa laws,\r\nthere is none here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING DISCRIMINATING DUTIES, DECEMBER 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,\r\n1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on\r\nPrussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that upon satisfactory\r\nevidence being given to the President of the United States by the\r\ngovernment of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage\r\nor impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon\r\nvessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the\r\nproduce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United\r\nStates or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to\r\nissue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and\r\ndiscontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and\r\nthe produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United\r\nStates in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other\r\nforeign country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such\r\nnotification being given to the President of the United States and to\r\ncontinue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be\r\ncontinued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an\r\nofficial communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the\r\n28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and\r\nimpost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838,\r\nin the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of\r\nthe United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise\r\nimported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country\r\nwhatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the\r\nsame ports under like circumstances:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts\r\nimposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United\r\nStates are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects\r\nthe vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the\r\nmerchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions\r\nof Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said\r\nsuspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue\r\nthenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the\r\nUnited States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported\r\ninto the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be\r\ncontinued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the city of Washington, the sixteenth day\r\nof December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\nsixty-three, and the eighty-eighth of the Independence of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nHerewith I lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of\r\ngentlemen representing the freedmen's aid societies in Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Cincinnati. The subject of the letter, as indicated\r\nabove, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these\r\ngentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered\r\nwith great attention and care. Not having the time to form a mature\r\njudgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I\r\nsubmit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention thereto\r\nis almost imperatively demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HURLBUT.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

I personally knew him, and did not think him a bad\r\nman. Please do not let him be executed unless upon further order from me,\r\nand in the meantime send me a transcript of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, December 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT, Chattanooga, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nThe Indiana delegation in Congress, or at least a large part of them, are\r\nvery anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, and I\r\nshare in this feeling. He is not a difficult man to satisfy, sincerity and\r\ncourage being his strong traits. Believing in our cause, and wanting\r\nto fight for it, is the whole matter with him. Could you, without\r\nembarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I promised,\r\nhe called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had thrown\r\nthe completion of vessels back so much that he thought General Gilimore's\r\nproposition entirely proper. He only wishes (and in which I concur) that\r\nGeneral Gillmore will courteously confer with, and explain to, Admiral\r\nDahlgren.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand\r\nsubstantially as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe\r\nthat the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously\r\nupon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and I think\r\nthere is some force in that view.\r\n\r\nAs to retaining General Schofield temporarily, if this should be done,\r\nI believe I should scarcely be able to get his nomination through the\r\nSenate. Send me over his nomination, which, however, I am not quite ready\r\nto send to the Senate.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO O. D. FILLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nO. D. FILLEY, ST. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nI have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of\r\nSt. Louis, and three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a Mr.\r\nNathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the\r\nRev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and mercy,\r\nthat I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights. This\r\ngives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld.\r\n\r\nYour letter states that Provost-Marshal Dick, about a year ago, ordered\r\nthe arrest of Dr. McPheeters, pastor of the Vine Street Church, prohibited\r\nhim from officiating, and placed the management of the affairs of the\r\nchurch out of the control of its chosen trustees; and near the close\r\nyou state that a certain course \"would insure his release.\" Mr. Ranney's\r\nletter says: \"Dr. Samuel S. McPheeters is enjoying all the rights of a\r\ncivilian, but cannot preach the Gospel!!!!\" Mr. Coalter, in his letter,\r\nasks: \"Is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things, that\r\nthe question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis\r\nshall be decided by the President of the United States?\"\r\n\r\nNow, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little as if you\r\ngentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike; one\r\naffirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, and\r\nanother pointing out to me what will secure his release! On the second day\r\nof January last, I wrote to General Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick's order\r\nupon Dr. McPheeters; and, as I suppose the doctor is enjoying all the\r\nrights of a civilian, I only quote that part of my letter which relates\r\nto the church. It is as follows: \"But I must add that the United States\r\nGovernment must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When\r\nan individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public\r\ninterest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take care\r\nof themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,\r\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter going to General Curtis, then in command there, I supposed, of\r\ncourse, it was obeyed, especially as I heard no further complaint from\r\nDr. McPheeters or his friends for nearly an entire year. I have never\r\ninterfered, nor thought of interfering, as to who shall or shall not\r\npreach in any church; nor have I knowingly or believingly tolerated any\r\none else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by\r\ncolor of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known\r\nto me. If, after all, what is now sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters\r\nback over the heads of a majority of his own congregation, that, too, will\r\nbe declined. I will not have control of any church on any side.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I intend you to be master in every controversy\r\nmade with you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nJacob Bowers is fully pardoned for past offence, upon condition that he\r\nreturns to duty and re-enlists for three years or during the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, December 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Please fix up the department to which Curtis is to go, without\r\nwaiting to wind up the Missouri matter. Lane is very anxious to have Fort\r\nSmith in it, and I am willing, unless there be decided military reasons to\r\nthe contrary, in which case of course, I am not for it. It will oblige me\r\nto have the Curtis department fixed at once.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PIERPOINT, Alexandria, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease call and see me to-day if not too inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 2, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The Secretary of War and myself have concluded to discharge of the\r\nprisoners at Point Lookout the following classes: First, those who will\r\ntake the oath prescribed in the proclamation of December 8, and issued by\r\nthe consent of General Marston, will enlist in our service. Second, those\r\nwho will take the oath and be discharged and whose homes lie safely within\r\nour military lines.\r\n\r\nI send by Mr. Hay this letter and a blank-book and some other blanks, the\r\nway of using which I propose for him to explain verbally better than I can\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\nYours, very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\r\n\r\nIf not inconsistent with the service, please allow General William Harrow\r\nas long a leave of absence as the rules permit with the understanding that\r\nI may lengthen it if I see fit. He is an acquaintance and friend of mine,\r\nand his family matters very urgently require his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nBy a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved December 23, 1863,\r\nthe paying of bounties to veteran volunteers, as now practiced by the\r\nWar Department, is, to the extent of three hundred dollars in each case,\r\nprohibited after this 5th day of the present month. I transmit for your\r\nconsideration a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by\r\none from the Provost-Marshal General to him, both relating to the subject\r\nabove mentioned. I earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to\r\nallow bounties to be paid as they now are, at least until the ensuing 1st\r\nday of February.\r\n\r\nI am not without anxiety lest I appear to be importunate in thus recalling\r\nyour attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted, and\r\nnothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could\r\ninduce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point. The\r\nExecutive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned, and it\r\nis now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that I feel\r\nconstrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 6, 1864. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. Nothing is known here about General Foster's\r\norder, of which you complain, beyond the fair presumption that it comes\r\nfrom General Grant, and that it has an object which, if you understood,\r\nyou would be loath to frustrate. True, these troops are, in strict law,\r\nonly to be removed by my order; but General Grant's judgment would be the\r\nhighest incentive to me to make such order. Nor can I understand how doing\r\nso is bad faith and dishonor, nor yet how it so exposes Kentucky to ruin.\r\nMilitary men here do not perceive how it exposes Kentucky, and I am sure\r\nGrant would not permit it if it so appeared to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL Q. A. GILLMORE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GILLMORE:\r\n\r\nI understand an effort is being made by some worthy gentlemen to\r\nreconstruct a legal State government in Florida. Florida is in your\r\nDepartment, and it is not unlikely you may be there in person. I have\r\ngiven Mr. Hay a commission of major, and sent him to you, with some\r\nblank-books and other blanks, to aid in the reconstruction. He will\r\nexplain as to the manner of using the blanks, and also my general views on\r\nthe subject. It is desirable for all to co-operate, but if irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion shall arise, you are master. I wish the thing done\r\nin the most speedy way, so that when done it be within the range of the\r\nlate proclamation on the subject. The detail labor will, of course, have\r\nto be done by others; but I will be greatly obliged if you will give\r\nit such general supervision as you can find consistent with your more\r\nstrictly military duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BROUGH. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 15,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BROUGH, Columbus, Ohio:\r\n\r\nIf Private William G. Toles, of Fifty-ninth Ohio Volunteers, returns to\r\nhis regiment and faithfully serves out his term, he is fully pardoned for\r\nall military offenses prior to this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CROSBY AND NICHOLS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. CROSBY AND NICHOLS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The number for this month and year of the North American Review\r\nwas duly received, and for which please accept my thanks. Of course I am\r\nnot the most impartial judge; yet, with due allowance for this, I venture\r\nto hope that the article entitled \"The President's Policy\" will be of\r\nvalue to the country. I fear I am not worthy of all which is therein\r\nkindly said of me personally.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of twelve lines, commencing at the top of page 252, I could\r\nwish to be not exactly what it is. In what is there expressed, the writer\r\nhas not correctly understood me. I have never had a theory that secession\r\ncould absolve States or people from their obligations. Precisely the\r\ncontrary is asserted in the inaugural address; and it was because of my\r\nbelief in the continuation of those obligations that I was puzzled, for\r\na time, as to denying the legal rights of those citizens who remained\r\nindividually innocent of treason or rebellion. But I mean no more now than\r\nto merely call attention to this point.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL P. STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE:\r\n\r\nSundry citizens of the State of Arkansas petition me that an election may\r\nbe held in that State, at which to elect a Governor; that it be assumed\r\nat that election, and thenceforward, that the constitution and laws of\r\nthe State, as before the rebellion, are in full force, except that the\r\nconstitution is so modified as to declare that there shall be neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude, except in the punishment of crimes\r\nwhereof the party shall have been duly convicted; that the General\r\nAssembly may make such provisions for the freed people as shall recognize\r\nand declare their permanent freedom, and provide for their education, and\r\nwhich may yet be construed as a temporary arrangement suitable to their\r\ncondition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class; that said election\r\nshall be held on the 28th of March, 1864, at all the usual places of the\r\nState, or all such as voters may attend for that purpose, that the voters\r\nattending at eight o'clock in the morning of said day may choose judges\r\nand clerks of election for such purpose; that all persons qualified\r\nby said constitution and laws, and taking the oath presented in the\r\nPresident's proclamation of December 8, 1863, either before or at the\r\nelection, and none others, may be voters; that each set of judges and\r\nclerks may make returns directly to you on or before the --th day of ----\r\nnext; that in all other respects said election may be conducted according\r\nto said constitution and laws: that on receipt of said returns, when five\r\nthousand four hundred and six votes shall have been cast, you can receive\r\nsaid votes, and ascertain all who shall thereby appear to have been\r\nelected; that on the --th day of ------ next, all persons so appearing to\r\nhave been elected, who shall appear before you at Little Rock, and take\r\nthe oath, to be by you severally administered, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States and said modified Constitution of the State of\r\nArkansas, may be declared by you qualified and empowered to enter\r\nimmediately upon the duties of the offices to which they shall have been\r\nrespectively elected.\r\n\r\nYou will please order an election to take place on the 28th of March,\r\n1864, and returns to be made in fifteen days thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, JANUARY 20, 1864\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a letter addressed by the Secretary of State, with my\r\napproval, to the Hon. Joseph A. Wright, of Indiana, that patriotic and\r\ndistinguished gentleman repaired to Europe and attended the International\r\nAgricultural Exhibition, held at Hamburg last year, and has since his\r\nreturn made a report to me, which, it is believed, can not fail to be\r\nof general interest, and especially so to the agricultural community. I\r\ntransmit for your consideration copies of the letters and report. While\r\nit appears by the letter that no reimbursement of expenses or compensation\r\nwas promised him, I submit whether reasonable allowance should not be made\r\nhim for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER APPROVING TRADE REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States having seen and\r\nconsidered the additional regulations of trade prescribed by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and numbered LI, LII, LIII, LIV, LV, and LVI, do hereby\r\napprove the same; and I further declare and order that all property\r\nbrought in for sale, in good faith, and actually sold in pursuance of said\r\nRegulations LII, LIII, LIV, LV, and LVI, after the same shall have taken\r\neffect and come in force as provided in Regulation LVI, shall be exempt\r\nfrom confiscation or forfeiture to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C., January 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nIs a supposed correspondence between General Longstreet and yourself about\r\nthe amnesty proclamation, which is now in the newspapers, genuine?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO E. STANLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 28, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. EDWARD STANLEY, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. We have rumors similar to the dispatch\r\nreceived by you, but nothing very definite from North Carolina. Knowing\r\nMr. Stanley to be an able man, and not doubting that he is a patriot, I\r\nshould be glad for him to be with his old acquaintances south of Virginia,\r\nbut I am unable to suggest anything definite upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nSome citizens of Missouri, vicinity of Kansas City, are apprehensive that\r\nthere is special danger of renewed troubles in that neighborhood, and\r\nthence on the route toward New Mexico. I am not impressed that the danger\r\nis very great or imminent, but I will thank you to give Generals Rosecrans\r\nand Curtis, respectively, such orders as may turn their attention thereto\r\nand prevent as far as possible the apprehended disturbance.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SICKLES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SICKLES, New York:\r\n\r\nCould you, without it being inconvenient or disagreeable to yourself,\r\nimmediately take a trip to Arkansas for me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nSIR:-You are directed to have a transport (either a steam or sailing\r\nvessel, as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster-General) sent to the\r\ncolored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache,\r\non the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the\r\ncolonists there as desire to return. You will have the transport furnished\r\nwith suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the\r\nQuartermaster's Department, who, under special instructions to be given,\r\nshall have charge of the business. The colonists will be brought to\r\nWashington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and\r\nprovided for at the camps for colored persons around that city. Those only\r\nwill be brought from the island who desire to return, and their effects\r\nwill be brought with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER FOR A DRAFT OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 1, 1864.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That a draft of five hundred thousand (500,000) men, to serve for\r\nthree years or during the war, be made on the tenth (10th) day of March\r\nnext, for the military service of the United States, crediting and\r\ndeducting therefrom so many as may have been enlisted or drafted into the\r\nservice prior to the first (1st) day of March, and not before credited.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MURPHY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR J. MURPHY:\r\n\r\nMy order to General Steele about an election was made in ignorance of\r\nthe action your convention had taken or would take. A subsequent letter\r\ndirects General Steele to aid you on your own plan, and not to thwart or\r\nhinder you. Show this to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\nTOLD BY THE PRESIDENT, TO THE ARTIST F. B. CARPENTER,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"midsummer, 1862. Things had gone on\r\nfrom bad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on\r\nthe plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our\r\nlast card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game. I now determined\r\nupon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation\r\nwith, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft\r\nof the proclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet\r\nmeeting upon the subject. This was the last of July or the first part of\r\nthe month of August, 1862. [The exact date was July 22, 1862.]... All were\r\npresent excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at the\r\nopening of the discussion, but came in subsequently. I said to the Cabinet\r\nthat I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to\r\nask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before\r\nthem, suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it\r\nread. Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no\r\ncomment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward. Various suggestions\r\nwere offered. Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to\r\nthe arming of the blacks.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the ground that it\r\nwould cost the administration the fall elections. Nothing, however, was\r\noffered that I had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind,\r\nuntil Secretary Seward spoke. He said in substance, 'Mr. President, I\r\napprove of the proclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue\r\nat this juncture. The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our\r\nrepeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a\r\nstep. It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government,\r\na cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia,\r\ninstead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.' His\r\nidea,\" said the President, \"was that it would be considered our last\r\nshriek on the retreat.\" [This was his precise expression.] 'Now,'\r\ncontinued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that\r\nyou postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by\r\nmilitary success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon\r\nthe greatest disasters of the war.' Mr. Lincoln continued \"The wisdom of\r\nthe view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force. It\r\nwas an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I\r\nhad entirely overlooked. The result was that I put the draft of the\r\nproclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\"From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it up here and\r\nthere, anxiously watching the process of events. Well, the next news we\r\nhad was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run. Things looked darker than ever.\r\nFinally came the week of the battle of Antietam. I determined to wait no\r\nlonger. The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on\r\nour side. I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home [three miles out of\r\nWashington]. Here I finished writing the second draft of the preliminary\r\nproclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet together to hear it,\r\nand it was published on the following Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SEDGWICK, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nUnless there be some strong reason to the contrary, please send General\r\nKilpatrick to us here, for two or three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO HORACE MAYNARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE MAYNARD, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour letter of [the] second received. Of course Governor Johnson will\r\nproceed with reorganization as the exigencies of the case appear to him to\r\nrequire. I do not apprehend he will think it necessary to deviate from my\r\nviews to any ruinous extent. On one hasty reading I see no such deviation\r\nin his program, which you send.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

FISHBACK, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nWhen I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance that\r\nyour convention was doing the same work. Since I learned the latter fact\r\nI have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them. I have sent two\r\nletters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you and others,\r\nsaying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably\r\nbe best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan. Some single\r\nmind must be master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and\r\nGeneral Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the\r\nbest man to be that master. Even now citizens are telegraphing me to\r\npostpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the\r\nconvention or by me. This discord must be silenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nThe day fixed by the convention for the election is probably the best,\r\nbut you on the ground, and in consultation with gentlemen there, are to\r\ndecide. I should have fixed no day for an election, presented no plan for\r\nreconstruction, had I known the convention was doing the same things. It\r\nis probably best that you merely assist the convention on their own\r\nplan, as to election day and all other matters I have already written and\r\ntelegraphed this half a dozen times.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nA. ROBINSON, Leroy, N. Y.:\r\n\r\nThe law only obliges us to keep accounts with States, or at most\r\nCongressional Districts, and it would overwhelm us to attempt in counties,\r\ncities and towns. Nevertheless we do what we can to oblige in particular\r\ncases. In this view I send your dispatch to the Provost-Marshal General,\r\nasking him to do the best he can for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING BLOCKADE, FEBRUARY 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons\r\ntherein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of\r\nBrownsville, in the district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas,\r\nhas since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be\r\nsafely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled \"An\r\nact further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of\r\nBrownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date,\r\nthat commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things,\r\nand information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on,\r\nsubject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been\r\nsuppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding\r\nthe department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at\r\nsaid port. This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment\r\nor conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the\r\ninsurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for\r\ntheir aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary\r\nof War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following\r\nprohibited articles, namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs,\r\ngrenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords,\r\nboarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which\r\nmay be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the\r\ncrew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other\r\ncaps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and\r\ncordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines.\r\n\r\nTo vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of\r\nBrownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by\r\nconsuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel\r\nso licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or\r\nprohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall\r\nbe exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and,\r\nif required, to any officer in charge of the blockade, and on leaving said\r\nport every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector\r\nof the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions\r\nof the license. Any violations of said conditions will involve the\r\nforfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of\r\nall parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United\r\nStates during the war for any purpose whatever.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains\r\nin full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is\r\nit relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which\r\nrelaxation is or has been expressly applied.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\neighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BLAKE, Commandant Naval Academy, Newport, R. I.:\r\n\r\nI desire the case of Midshipman C. Lyon re-examined and if not clearly\r\ninconsistent I shall be much obliged to have the recommendation changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM WARREN JORDAN.\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, February 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nIn county and State elections, must citizens of Tennessee take the oath\r\nprescribed by Governor Johnson, or will the President's oath of amnesty\r\nentitle them to vote? I have been appointed to hold the March election in\r\nCheatham County, and wish to act understandingly.\r\n\r\nWARREN JORDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nWARREN JORDAN, NASHVILLE:\r\n\r\nIn county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson's plan;\r\notherwise you will have conflict and confusion. I have seen his plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., February 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Saint LOUIS, MO.:\r\n\r\nColonel Sanderson will be ordered to you to-day, a mere omission that it\r\nwas not done before. The other questions in your despatch I am not yet\r\nprepared to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Let\r\nthe election be on the 14th of March as they agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL F. STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nGeneral Sickles is not going to Arkansas. He probably will make a tour\r\ndown the Mississippi and home by the gulf and ocean, but he will not\r\nmeddle in your affairs.\r\n\r\nAt one time I did intend to have him call on you and explain more fully\r\nthan I could do by letter or telegraph, so as to avoid a difficulty coming\r\nof my having made a plan here, while the convention made one there, for\r\nreorganizing Arkansas; but even his doing that has been given up for\r\nmore than two weeks. Please show this to Governor Murphy to save me\r\ntelegraphing him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTERS DEATH SENTENCES REMITTED\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, NO.76.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nSentence of Deserters.\r\n\r\nThe President directs that the sentences of all deserters who have been\r\ncondemned by court-martial to death, and that have not been otherwise\r\nacted upon by him, be mitigated to imprisonment during the war at the Dry\r\nTortugas, Florida, where they will be sent under suitable guards by orders\r\nfrom army commanders.\r\n\r\nThe commanding generals, who have power to act on proceedings of\r\ncourts-martial in such cases, are authorized in special cases to restore\r\nto duty deserters under sentence, when in their judgment the service will\r\nbe thereby benefited.\r\n\r\nCopies of all orders issued under the foregoing instructions will be\r\nimmediately forwarded to the Adjutant-General and to the Judge-Advocate\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War: B.

Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI cannot remember at whose request it was that I gave the pass to Mrs.\r\nBulky. Of course detain her, if the evidence of her being a spy is strong\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. JAYNE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. W. JAYNE.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I dislike to make changes in office so long as they can\r\nbe avoided. It multiplies my embarrassments immensely. I dislike two\r\nappointments when one will do. Send me the name of some man not the\r\npresent marshal, and I will nominate him to be Provost-Marshal for Dakota.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. H. EAST.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. E. H: EAST, Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee\r\n\r\nYour telegram of the twenty-sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch\r\nto Warren Jordan, Esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred\r\nto me by Governor Johnson. In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief\r\nand hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of\r\nTennessee, the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on\r\nthe twenty-sixth of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on\r\nthe first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test\r\nof loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections;\r\nand coming from him would better be observed and followed. There is\r\nno conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth\r\nDecember, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his\r\nproclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.\r\n\r\nNo person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth December, 1863, and\r\nobtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good\r\nfaith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor\r\nJohnson as a test of loyalty.\r\n\r\nI have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely\r\nsatisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and\r\nplace it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPlease send above to Governor Johnson. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 27, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--You ask some instructions from me in relation to the Report of\r\nSpecial Commission constituted by an order of the War Department, dated\r\nDecember 5, 1863, \"to revise the enrolment and quotas of the City and\r\nState of New York, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or\r\nirregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should be made.\"\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between the Governor of New York and myself last\r\nsummer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the\r\ndistricts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made;\r\nand in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an\r\narbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they\r\nseemed too large, and said: \"After this drawing, these four districts,\r\nand also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled,\r\nand, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the\r\nprocess.\" In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were\r\nput into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work\r\nover according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and\r\nthereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The commission,\r\nwhose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally\r\ndifferent idea. Not going forth to find men at all, they have proceeded\r\naltogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their\r\nconclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and attempting\r\nto follow it, the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments\r\nmuch more accurately than they did. The report on this point might be\r\nuseful to Congress. The commission conclude that the quotas for the draft\r\nshould be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis\r\nto give a table for the State of New York, in which some districts are\r\nreduced and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas\r\nstand as made by the enrolling officers, in the districts wherein this\r\ntable requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to\r\nthe table in the others: this to be no precedent for subsequent action.\r\nBut, as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have\r\nmuch that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given\r\nit, and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be\r\nconformed to without an alteration of the law.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL L. THOMAS, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nI see your despatch of yesterday to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI wish you would go to the Mississippi River at once, and take hold of and\r\nbe master in the contraband and leasing business. You understand it better\r\nthan any other man does. Mr. Miller's system doubtless is well intended,\r\nbut from what I hear I fear that, if persisted in, it would fall dead\r\nwithin its own entangling details. Go there and be the judge. A Mr. Lewis\r\nwill probably follow you with something from me on this subject, but do\r\nnot wait for him. Nor is this to induce you to violate or neglect any\r\nmilitary order from the General-in-Chief or Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I would have taken time to answer yours of the 22d inst.\r\nsooner, only that I did not suppose any evil could result from the delay,\r\nespecially as, by a note, I promptly acknowledged the receipt of yours,\r\nand promised a fuller answer. Now, on consideration I find there is really\r\nvery little to say. My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's letter having been made\r\npublic came to me only the day you wrote; but I had, in spite of myself,\r\nknown of its existence several days before. I have not yet read it, and I\r\nthink I shall not. I was not shocked or surprised by the appearance of\r\nthe letter, because I had had knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's committee, and of\r\nsecret issues which, I supposed, came from it, and of secret agents who,\r\nI supposed, were sent out by it for several weeks. I have known just as\r\nlittle a these things as my friends have allowed me to know. They bring\r\nthe documents to me, but I do not read them; they tell me what they think\r\nfit to tell me, but I do not inquire for more.\r\n\r\nI fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be held responsible\r\nfor what our respective friends may do without our instigation or\r\ncountenance and I assure you, as you have assured me, that no assault has\r\nbeen made upon you by my instigation, or with my countenance.\r\n\r\nWhether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury Department is a\r\nquestion which I will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint\r\nother than my judgment of the public service, and, in that view, I do not\r\nperceive occasion for a change.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, March 1,1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL L. THOMAS:\r\n\r\nThis introduces Mr. Lewis, mentioned in my despatch sent you at Louisville\r\nsome days ago. I have but little personal acquaintance with him; but he\r\nhas the confidence of several members of Congress here who seem to know\r\nhim well. He hopes to be useful, without charge to the government, in\r\nfacilitating the introduction of the free-labor system on the Mississippi\r\nplantations. He is acquainted with, and has access to, many of the\r\nplanters who wish to adopt the system. He will show you two letters of\r\nmine on this subject, one somewhat General, and the other relating to\r\nnamed persons; they are not different in principle. He will also show you\r\nsome suggestions coming from some of the planters themselves. I desire\r\nthat all I promise in these letters, so far as practicable, may be in good\r\nfaith carried out, and that suggestions from the planters may be heard\r\nand adopted, so far as they may not contravene the principles stated, nor\r\njustice, nor fairness, to laborers. I do not herein intend to overrule\r\nyour own mature judgment on any point.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Ark.:\r\n\r\nYours including address to people of Arkansas is received. I approve the\r\naddress and thank you for it. Yours in relation to William M. Randolph\r\nalso received. Let him take the oath of December 8, and go to work for the\r\nnew constitution, and on your notifying me of it, I will immediately issue\r\nthe special pardon for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO SENATE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 1st instant,\r\nrespecting the points of commencement of the Union Pacific Railroad, on\r\nthe one hundredth degree of west longitude, and of the branch road,\r\nfrom the western boundary of Iowa to the said one hundredth degree of\r\nlongitude, I transmit the accompanying report from the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, containing the information called for.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to add that on the 17th day of November last an Executive\r\norder was made upon this subject and delivered to the vice-president of\r\nthe Union Pacific Railroad Company, which fixed the point on the western\r\nboundary of the State of Iowa from which the company should construct\r\ntheir branch road to the one hundredth degree of west longitude, and\r\ndeclared it to be within the limits of the township in Iowa opposite the\r\ntown of Omaha, in Nebraska. Since then the company has represented to me\r\nthat upon actual surveys made it has determined upon the precise point of\r\ndeparture of their said branch road from the Missouri River, and located\r\nthe same as described in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, which point is within the limits designated in the order of\r\nNovember last; and inasmuch as that order is not of record in any of the\r\nExecutive Departments, and the company having desired a more definite one,\r\nI have made the order of which a copy is herewith, and caused the same to\r\nbe filed in the Department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO GENERAL GRANT,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT:--The expression of the nation's approbation of what you\r\nhave already done, and its reliance on you for what remains to do in\r\nthe existing great struggle, is now presented with this commission\r\nconstituting you Lieutenant-General of the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith this high honor, devolves on you an additional responsibility. As the\r\ncountry herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you. I scarcely\r\nneed add, that with what I here speak for the country, goes my own hearty\r\npersonal concurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT:--I accept this commission, with gratitude for the high\r\nhonor conferred.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the noble armies that have fought on so many fields for\r\nour common country, it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nI feel the full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me, and I\r\nknow that if they are met, it will be due to those armies; and above all,\r\nto the favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ASSIGNING U.

Do your best to get out the largest vote possible, and of\r\ncourse as much of it as possible on the right side.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HAHN. (Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 13, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. MICHAEL HAHN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as\r\nthe first free-state governor of Louisiana. Now, you are about to have\r\na convention, which among other things will probably define the elective\r\nfranchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration, whether some\r\nof the colored people may not be let in,--as, for instance, the very\r\nintelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks.\r\nThey would probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the\r\njewel of liberty within the family of freedom. But this is only a\r\nsuggestion,--not to the public, but to you alone.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn order to supply the force required to be drafted for the Navy and to\r\nprovide an adequate reserve force for all contingencies, in addition\r\nto the five hundred thousand men called for February 1, 1864, a call\r\nis hereby made and a draft ordered for two hundred thousand men for the\r\nmilitary service (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe proportional quotas for the different wards, towns, townships,\r\nprecincts, or election districts, or counties, will be made known through\r\nthe Provost Marshal-General's Bureau, and account will be taken of the\r\ncredits and deficiencies on former quotas.\r\n\r\nThe 15th day of April, 1864, is designated as the time up to which the\r\nnumbers required from each ward of a city, town, etc., may be raised by\r\nvoluntary enlistment, and drafts will be made in each ward of a city,\r\ntown, etc., which shall not have filled the quota assigned to it within\r\nthe time designated for the number required to fill said quotas. The\r\ndrafts will be commenced as soon after the 15th of April as practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Government bounties as now paid continue until April I, 1864, at which\r\ntime the additional bounties cease. On and after that date one hundred\r\ndollars bounty only will be paid, as provided by the act approved July 22,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT A FAIR IN THE PATENT OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI appear to say but a word. This extraordinary war in which we are engaged\r\nfalls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the\r\nsoldier. For it has been said, \"All that a man hath will he give for his\r\nlife;\" and while all contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his\r\nlife at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest\r\nmerit, then, is due to the soldier.\r\n\r\nIn this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments have manifested\r\nthemselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and among these\r\nmanifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the\r\nrelief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents of\r\nthese fairs are the women of America.\r\n\r\nI am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy: I have never studied\r\nthe art of paying compliments to women; but I must say, that if all that\r\nhas been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in\r\npraise of women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them\r\njustice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God\r\nbless the women of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE FROM THE WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nMARCH 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:\r\n\r\nThe honorary membership in your association, as generously tendered, is\r\ngratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nYou comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion means\r\nmore and tends to do more than the perpetuation of African slavery--that\r\nit is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people. Partly to\r\nshow that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot\r\nbetter express myself, I read a passage from the message to Congress in\r\nDecember, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government, the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the General\r\ntone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the\r\nexisting right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to\r\nparticipate in the selection of public officers, except the legislature,\r\nboldly advocated, with labored argument to prove that large control of the\r\npeople in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself\r\nis sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\n\"It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a General argument should be\r\nmade in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing, if not\r\nabove labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor\r\nis available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless\r\nsomebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to\r\nlabor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital\r\nshall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent or\r\nbuy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so\r\nit is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or\r\nwhat we call slaves. And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a\r\nhired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such\r\nrelation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing\r\nas a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer.\r\nBoth these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are\r\ngroundless.\r\n\r\n\"Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit\r\nof labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.\r\nLabor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection\r\nas any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\r\nwill be, a relation between capital and labor, producing mutual benefits.\r\nThe error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within\r\nthat relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves,\r\nand, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A\r\nlarge majority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have\r\nothers working for them. In most of the Southern States, a majority of the\r\nwhole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the\r\nNorthern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their\r\nfamilies, wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their\r\nfarms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to\r\nthemselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired\r\nlaborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable\r\nnumber of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor\r\nwith their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but\r\nthis is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\r\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\r\n\r\n\"Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such\r\nthing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their\r\nlives, were hired laborers. The prudent penniless beginner in the world\r\nlabors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land\r\nfor himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length\r\nhires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous\r\nand prosperous system which opens the way to all--gives hope to all, and\r\nconsequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all.\r\nNo men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from\r\npoverty--none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not\r\nhonestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power they\r\nalready possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close\r\nthe door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities\r\nand burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add. None\r\nare so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working\r\npeople. Let them beware of prejudices, working division and hostility\r\namong themselves. The most notable feature of a disturbance in your\r\ncity last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working\r\npeople. It should never be so. The strongest bond of human sympathy,\r\noutside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people,\r\nof all nations, and tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to a war\r\nupon property, or the owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor;\r\nproperty is desirable; is a positive good in the world. That some\r\nshould be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just\r\nencouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless\r\npull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build\r\none for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from\r\nviolence when built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nHon. W. R. Morrison says he has requested you by letter to effect a\r\nspecial exchange of Lieut. Col. A. F. Rogers, of Eightieth Illinois\r\nVolunteers, now in Libby Prison, and I shall be glad if you can effect it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n( Private.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of February 29 reached me only four days ago; but the\r\ndelay was of little consequence, because I found, on feeling around, I\r\ncould not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be\r\nunpleasant, and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service. Allow\r\nme to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it\r\nis very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a\r\nmajor-general once out, it is next to impossible for even the President\r\nto get him in again. With my appreciation of your ability and correct\r\nprinciple, of course I would be very glad to have your service for\r\nthe country in the approaching political canvass; but I fear we cannot\r\nproperly have it without separating you from the military.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION ABOUT AMNESTY,\r\n\r\nMARCH 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent\r\nenemies are entitled to the benefits of the Proclamation of the President\r\nof the United States, which was made on the 8th day of December, 1863,\r\nand the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these\r\nbenefits; and whereas the objects of that Proclamation were to suppress\r\nthe insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States; and\r\nwhereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with\r\nreference to these objects alone:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim and declare that the said Proclamation does not apply\r\nto the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the\r\nbenefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military,\r\nnaval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of\r\nthe civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States,\r\nas prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either\r\nbefore or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only\r\nto those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest,\r\nconfinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said\r\noath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nPersons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said Proclamation may\r\napply to the President for clemency, like all other offenders, and their\r\napplication will receive due consideration.\r\n\r\nI do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid\r\nproclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed\r\nbefore any commissioned officer, civil, military, or naval, in the service\r\nof the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or\r\nTerritory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified\r\nfor administering oaths.\r\n\r\nAll officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give\r\ncertificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made,\r\nand such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of\r\nsuch oaths, at as early a day as may be convenient, to the Department of\r\nState, where they will be deposited, and remain in the archives of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State will keep a registry thereof, and will, on\r\napplication, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the\r\ncustomary form of official certificates.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have the\r\nfollowing points definitely fixed:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished, by\r\nKentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able-bodied\r\nmen of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required\r\nto furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nSecond. To whatever extent the enlistment and drafting, one or both,\r\nof colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be\r\nconducted within the law of Congress; and, so far as practicable, free\r\nfrom collateral embarrassments, disorders, and provocations.\r\n\r\nI think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be\r\nobliged if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to\r\neffect these objects.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. G. MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter to Colonel Townsend, inclosing a slip from the\r\n\"Herald,\" and asking a court of inquiry, has been laid before me by the\r\nSecretary of War, with the request that I would consider it. It is quite\r\nnatural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not\r\nimpressed, nor do I think the country is impressed, with the belief that\r\nyour honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an inquiry. The\r\ncountry knows that at all events you have done good service; and I believe\r\nit agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying\r\nto do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a court\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 29,1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nCaptain Kinney, of whom I spoke to you as desiring to go on your staff,\r\nis now in your camp, in company with Mrs. Senator Dixon. Mrs. Grant and I,\r\nand some others, agreed last night that I should, by this despatch, kindly\r\ncall your attention to Captain Kinney.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. G. HODGES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nA. G. HODGES, ESQ., Frankfort, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I\r\nverbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and\r\nSenator Dixon. It was about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\r\nI cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never\r\nunderstood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to\r\nact officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took\r\nthat I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States. I could not take the office without\r\ntaking the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get\r\npower, and break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in\r\nordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically\r\nindulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I\r\nhad publicly declared this many times, and in many ways. And I aver that,\r\nto this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract\r\njudgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand, however, that my oath\r\nto preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me\r\nthe duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government,\r\nthat nation, of which that Constitution was the organic law. Was it\r\npossible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By General\r\nlaw, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated\r\nto save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I\r\nfelt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by\r\nbecoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through\r\nthe preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and\r\nnow avow it. I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even\r\ntried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any\r\nminor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and\r\nConstitution, altogether. When, early in the war, General Fremont\r\nattempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then\r\nthink it an indispensable necessity. When, a little later, General\r\nCameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I\r\nobjected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity.\r\nWhen, still later, General Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again\r\nforbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity\r\nhad come. When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and\r\nsuccessive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated emancipation,\r\nI believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and\r\narming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They\r\ndeclined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to\r\nthe alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the\r\nConstitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose\r\nthe latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of\r\nthis I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no\r\nloss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment,\r\nnone in our white military force, no loss by it any how, or anywhere. On\r\nthe contrary, it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand\r\nsoldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as\r\nfacts, there can be no caviling. We have the men; and we could not have\r\nhad them without the measure.\r\n\r\n\"And now let any Union man who complains of the measure test himself by\r\nwriting down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force\r\nof arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty\r\nthousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but\r\nfor the measure he condemns. If he cannot face his case so stated, it is\r\nonly because he cannot face the truth.\"\r\n\r\nI add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In telling this\r\ntale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have\r\ncontrolled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.\r\nNow, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's condition is not\r\nwhat either party, or any man, devised or expected. God alone can claim\r\nit. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a\r\ngreat wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of\r\nthe South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial\r\nhistory will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and\r\ngoodness of God.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. HORACE MANN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS HORACE MANN:\r\n\r\nMADAM:--The petition of persons under eighteen, praying that I would\r\nfree all slave children, and the heading of which petition it appears you\r\nwrote, was handed me a few days since by Senator Sumner. Please tell these\r\nlittle people I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and\r\ngenerous sympathy, and that, while I have not the power to grant all they\r\nask, I trust they will remember that God has, and that, as it seems, he\r\nwills to do it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI am pressed to get from Libby, by special exchange, Jacob C. Hagenbuek,\r\nfirst lieutenant, Company H, Sixty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers. Please\r\ndo it if you can without detriment or embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nPrivate William Collins of Company B, of the Sixty-ninth New York\r\nVolunteers, has been convicted of desertion, and execution suspended as\r\nin numerous other cases. Now Captain O'Neill, commanding the regiment,\r\nand nearly all its other regimental and company officers, petition for his\r\nfull pardon and restoration to his company. Is there any good objection?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE ON LIBERTY\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT SANITARY FAIR IN BALTIMORE,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--Calling to mind that we are in Baltimore, we\r\ncannot fail to note that the world moves. Looking upon these many people\r\nassembled here to serve, as they best may, the soldiers of the Union, it\r\noccurs at once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so much\r\nas pass through Baltimore. The change from then till now is both great and\r\ngratifying. Blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change, and\r\nthe fair women who strive to reward them for it!\r\n\r\nBut Baltimore suggests more than could happen within Baltimore. The change\r\nwithin Baltimore is part only of a far wider change. When the war began,\r\nthree years ago, neither party, nor any man, expected it would last till\r\nnow. Each looked for the end, in some way, long ere to-day. Neither did\r\nany anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war.\r\nBut here we are; the war has not ended, and slavery has been much affected\r\nhow much needs not now to be recounted. So true is it that man proposes\r\nand God disposes.\r\n\r\nBut we can see the past, though we may not claim to have directed it;\r\nand seeing it, in this case, we feel more hopeful and confident for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the\r\nAmerican people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for\r\nliberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.\r\nWith some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with\r\nhimself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may\r\nmean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product\r\nof other men's labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible\r\nthings, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of\r\nthe things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and\r\nincompatible names--liberty and tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep\r\nthanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the\r\nsame act, as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black\r\none. Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of\r\nthe word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails to-day among\r\nus human creatures, even in the North, and all professing to love liberty.\r\nHence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from\r\nunder the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and\r\nbewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty. Recently, as it\r\nseems, the people of Maryland have been doing something to define liberty,\r\nand thanks to them that, in what they have done, the wolf's dictionary has\r\nbeen repudiated.\r\n\r\nIt is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at length;\r\nbut there is another subject upon which I feel that I ought to say a word.\r\nA painful rumor, true, I fear, has reached us, of the massacre, by\r\nthe rebel forces at Fort Pillow, in the west end of Tennessee, on the\r\nMississippi River, of some three hundred colored soldiers and white\r\nofficers [I believe it latter turned out to be 500], who had just been\r\noverpowered by their assailants [numbering 5000]. There seems to be some\r\nanxiety in the public mind whether the Government is doing its duty to the\r\ncolored soldier, and to the service, at this point. At the beginning\r\nof the war, and for some time, the use of colored troops was not\r\ncontemplated; and how the change of purpose was wrought I will not now\r\ntake time to explain. Upon a clear conviction of duty I resolved to turn\r\nthat element of strength to account; and I am responsible for it to the\r\nAmerican people, to the Christian world, to history, and in my final\r\naccount to God. Having determined to use the negro as a soldier, there is\r\nno way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier. The\r\ndifficulty is not in stating the principle, but in practically applying\r\nit. It is a mistake to suppose the Government is indifferent to this\r\nmatter, or is not doing the best it can in regard to it. We do not to-day\r\nknow that a colored soldier, or white officer commanding colored soldiers,\r\nhas been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner. We fear it, we\r\nbelieve it, I may say,--but we do not know it. To take the life of one of\r\ntheir prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours, when it is short\r\nof certainty that they do murder ours, might be too serious, too cruel, a\r\nmistake. We are having the Fort Pillow affair thoroughly investigated; and\r\nsuch investigation will probably show conclusively how the truth is. If\r\nafter all that has been said it shall turn out that there has been no\r\nmassacre at Fort Pillow, it will be almost safe to say there has been\r\nnone, and will be none, elsewhere. If there has been the massacre of\r\nthree hundred there, or even the tenth part of three hundred, it will be\r\nconclusively proved; and being so proved, the retribution shall as surely\r\ncome. It will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course to\r\napply the retribution; but in the supposed case it must come.\r\n\r\n[There was a massacre of a black company and their officers at Fort\r\nPillow--they were prisoners who later on, the day of their capture,\r\nwere ordered executed. The black soldiers were tied alive to individual\r\nplanks--then man and plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned. The\r\nwhite officers were shot.

SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--According to our understanding with Major-General Frank P.\r\nBlair at the time he took his seat in Congress last winter, he now asks to\r\nwithdraw his resignation as Major-General, then tendered, and be sent to\r\nthe field. Let this be done. Let the order sending him be such as shown me\r\nto-day by the Adjutant-General, only dropping from it the names of Maguire\r\nand Tompkins.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Thanks for your kind remembrance. I\r\nwould accept your offer at once, were it not that I fear there might be\r\nsome impropriety in it, though I do not see that there would. I will think\r\nof it a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

The record has been\r\nexamined here, and it shows too strong a case for a pardon or commutation,\r\nunless there is something in the poor man's favor outside of the record,\r\nwhich you on the ground may know, but I do not. My note to you only means\r\nthat if you know of any such thing rendering a suspension of the execution\r\nproper, on your own judgment, you are at liberty to suspend it. Otherwise\r\nI do not interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

Whatever I can I will do to protect you; meanwhile you must do your\r\nutmost to protect yourselves. Present my greeting to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, APRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the President of\r\nthe United States, and through him to both Houses of Congress, on the\r\ncondition and wants of the people of east Tennessee, and asking their\r\nattention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government\r\nfor their relief, and which address is presented by a committee of an\r\norganization called \"The East Tennessee Relief Association.\"\r\n\r\nDeeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering\r\npeople, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their\r\nrelief. The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them\r\nwithin its power. Their address represents that the construction of direct\r\nrailroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of central\r\nKentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency. It may\r\nbe remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such railroad\r\nconstruction was recommended. I now add that, with the hearty concurrence\r\nof Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road, both for the\r\nrelief of these people and for its continuing military importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a copy of which is\r\nherewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement,\r\nwhich is believed to contain the information sought:\r\n\r\nPrior to and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of\r\nOhio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by\r\nand with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive\r\nas major-generals in the volunteer army. General Schenck tendered the\r\nresignation of his said commission, and took his seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal\r\nunderstanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might,\r\nat any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said\r\nresignation and return to the field.\r\n\r\nGeneral Blair was, by temporary assignment of General Sherman, in command\r\nof a corps through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march\r\nto the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November\r\nand early days of December last, and of course was not present at the\r\nassembling of Congress. When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and\r\nwas allowed by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions\r\nand promise as allowed and made to General Schenck.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when\r\nGeneral Grant was made Lieutenant-General, producing some change of\r\ncommanders, General Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps.\r\nThis was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and assented to by\r\nthem, and the particular corps for him designated.\r\n\r\nThis was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a\r\nmonth ago; but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's resignation,\r\nand making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not\r\nconsummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on the 23d of\r\nApril instant. As a summary of the whole, it may be stated that General\r\nBlair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein\r\nstated, and that it is believed he is now acting as major-General upon the\r\nassumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the\r\nfacts herein stated, and not otherwise. There are some letters, notes,\r\ntelegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents in connection with\r\nthis subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon\r\nit, but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nNot expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to\r\nexpress in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to\r\nthis time, so far as I understand it.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of your plans I neither know nor seek to know. You are\r\nvigilant and self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude\r\nany restraints or constraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any\r\ngreat disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I\r\nknow that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they\r\nwould be mine. If there be anything wanting which is within my power to\r\ngive, do not fail to let me know it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain you.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nMAY 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th\r\nultimo, a copy of which resolution is herewith returned, I have the honor\r\nto transmit the following:\r\n\r\n[Correspondence and orders relating to the resignation and reinstatement\r\nof Major-General Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing constitutes all sought by the resolution so far as is\r\nremembered or has been found upon diligent search.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., May 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Chattanooga, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nI have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens who say your Order\r\nNo.8 will compel them to go north of Nashville. This is in no sense an\r\norder, nor is it even a request that you will do anything which in the\r\nleast shall be a drawback upon your military operations, but anything you\r\ncan do consistently with those operations for those suffering people I\r\nshall be glad of.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Commanding, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to inquire whether a day has yet been fixed for\r\nthe execution of citizen Robert Louden, and if so what day?\r\n\r\nJOHN HAY, Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. S. B. McCONKEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS. SARAH B. McCONKEY, West Chester, Pa.:\r\n\r\nMADAM:--Our mutual friend, Judge Lewis, tells me you do me the honor to\r\ninquire for my personal welfare. I have been very anxious for some days in\r\nregard to our armies in the field, but am considerably cheered, just now,\r\nby favorable news from them.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will join me in the hope for their further success; while\r\nyourself, and other good mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters, do all\r\nyou and they can, to relieve and comfort the gallant soldiers who compose\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION OF THANKSGIVING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 9, 1864\r\n\r\nTO THE FRIENDS OF UNION AND LIBERTY:\r\n\r\nEnough is known of army operations, within the last five days, to claim\r\nour special gratitude to God. While what remains undone demands our most\r\nsincere prayers to and reliance upon Him (without whom all effort is\r\nvain), I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of\r\npublic worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and\r\nprayer to Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nMAY 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this\r\ncall, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to-day\r\nfrom the Army, than to a desire to see me. I am indeed very grateful to\r\nthe brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field, to\r\ntheir noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to our\r\nMaker. Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and\r\nsuccessfully. I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of\r\nGeneral Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than\r\nat first appears. I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know)\r\nthat General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made\r\nall his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he\r\nmoved his armies. I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what\r\nhas happened, but there is a great deal still to be done. While we are\r\ngrateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few\r\ndays, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThere is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to\r\nperform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest\r\nGeneral at the head of our armies, and sink all personal consideration\r\nfor the sake of the country. I commend you to keep yourselves in the same\r\ntranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man. I have\r\nsaid more than I expected when I came before you. Repeating my thanks for\r\nthis call, I bid you good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL LEW WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WALLACE, Baltimore:\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what is the trouble with Dr. Hawks. Also please ask Bishop\r\nWhittington to give me his view of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nComplaints are coming to me of disturbances in Canoll, Platte, and\r\nBuchanan counties. Please ascertain the truth, correct what is found\r\nwrong, and telegraph me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. B. LOOMIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 12, 1864\r\n\r\nF. B. LOOMIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\ncommunication of the 28th April, in which you offer to replace the present\r\ngarrison at Port Trumbull with volunteers, which you propose to raise at\r\nyour own expense. While it seems inexpedient at this time to accept\r\nthis proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the\r\ngarrison mentioned, I cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance\r\nof individual patriotism. Permit me, for the Government, to express my\r\ncordial thanks to you for this generous and public-spirited offer, which\r\nis worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nI am very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A METHODIST DELEGATION, MAY 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:-In response to your address, allow me to attest the accuracy of\r\nits historical statements, indorse the sentiments it expresses, and thank\r\nyou in the nation's name for the sure promise it gives. Nobly sustained,\r\nas the Government has been, by all the churches, I would utter nothing\r\nwhich might in the least appear invidious against any. Yet without this,\r\nit may fairly be said, that the Methodist Episcopal Church, not less\r\ndevoted than the best, is by its greatest numbers the most important\r\nof all. It is no fault in others that the Methodist Church sends more\r\nsoldiers to the field, more nurses to the hospitals, and more prayers\r\nto Heaven than--any other. God bless the Methodist Church Bless all the\r\nchurches; and blessed be God, who in this our great trial giveth us the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR YATES.

DIX.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN A. DIX, Commanding at New York:\r\n\r\nWhereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published\r\nthis morning in the New York World and New York Journal of Commerce,\r\nnewspapers printed and published in the city of New York, a false and\r\nspurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the President and to\r\nbe countersigned by the Secretary of State, which publication is of a\r\ntreasonable nature, designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of\r\nthe United States and to the rebels now at war against the Government and\r\ntheir aiders and abettors, you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith\r\nto arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command, the\r\neditors, proprietors, and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers, and all\r\nsuch persons as, after public notice has been given of the falsehood of\r\nsaid publication, print and publish the same with intent to give aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemy; and you will hold the persons so arrested in close\r\ncustody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission\r\nfor their offense. You will also take possession by military force of the\r\nprinting establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce, and\r\nhold the same until further orders, and prohibit any further publication\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[On the morning of May 18, 3864, a forged proclamation was published in\r\nthe World, and Journal of Commerce, of New York. The proclamation named a\r\nday for fasting and prayer, called for 400,000 fresh troops, and purposed\r\nto raise by an \"immediate and peremptory draft,\" whatever quotas were not\r\nfurnished on the day specified.

C., May 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Bermuda Hundred, Va.:\r\n\r\nUntil receiving your dispatch of yesterday, the idea of commissions in the\r\nvolunteers expiring at the end of three years had not occurred to me. I\r\nthink no trouble will come of it; and, at all events, I shall take care of\r\nit so far as in me lies. As to the major-generalships in the regular\r\narmy, I think I shall not dispose of another, at least until the combined\r\noperations now in progress, under direction of General Grant, and within\r\nwhich yourself and command are included, shall be terminated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on behalf of yourself, officers, and men, please accept my\r\nhearty thanks for what you and they have so far done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF AMERICAN CONSULS FROM MILITARY SERVICE\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is officially announced by the State Department that citizens of the\r\nUnited States holding commissions and recognized as Consuls of foreign\r\npowers, are not by law exempt from military service if drafted:\r\n\r\nTherefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate\r\nwill not be held to vacate his commission, but if he shall be drafted\r\nhis exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in\r\norder that another Consul may be received.\r\n\r\nAn exequatur bearing date the 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to\r\nCharles Hunt, a citizen of the United States, recognizing him as a Consul\r\nof Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and\r\nenjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls\r\nof the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt\r\nhaving sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country,\r\nin consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a\r\nforeign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said\r\nCharles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of\r\nsaid functions, powers, and privileges.\r\n\r\nThese are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Hunt\r\nas Consul of Belgium, for St. Louis, Missouri, and will not permit him to\r\nexercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers or privileges allowed to\r\nconsuls of that nation, and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the\r\nsaid exequatur heretofore given, and do declare the same to be absolutely\r\nnull and void from this day forward.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent,\r\nand the seal of the United States of America to be hereunto\r\naffixed................\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON AND OTHERS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, May 21, 1864\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON:\r\n\r\nThe getting forward of hundred-day troops to sustain General Sherman's\r\nlengthening lines promises much good. Please put your best efforts into\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nSame to Governor Yates, Springfield, Illinois; Governor Stone, Davenport,\r\nIowa; Governor Lewis, Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO CHRISTIANA A. SACK. WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D. C., May 21,\r\n1864\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANA A. SACK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nI cannot postpone the execution of a convicted spy on a mere telegraphic\r\ndespatch signed with a name I never heard before. General Wallace may give\r\nyou a pass to see him if he chooses.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BROUGH. WASHINGTON CITY, May 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BROUGH, Columbus, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYours to Secretary of War [received] asking for something cheering. We\r\nhave nothing bad from anywhere. I have just seen a despatch of Grant, of\r\n11 P.M., May 23, on the North Anna and partly across it, which ends as\r\nfollows: \"Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us.\" We have nothing\r\nlater from him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 25,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Swift wishes a pass from me to follow your army to pick up rags\r\nand cast-off clothing. I will give it to him if you say so, otherwise not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[\"No job to big or too small\" for this president--not even a request from\r\na Rag Picker. D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE NEW YORK NAVAL BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\r\n\r\nI am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for\r\ntransportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from New York to\r\nFortress Monroe. This force was a special organization got up by one\r\nBartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in\r\nfact, pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever. The\r\ncredit given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express\r\ndeclaration that the Government would not be responsible for the class of\r\nexpenses to which it belonged. After all some part of the transportation\r\nbecame useful to the Government, and equitably should be paid for; but\r\nI have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any\r\nappropriation to pay it with if ascertained. If the Quartermaster at New\r\nYork can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation\r\nas did result usefully to the Government, it might be a step towards\r\nreaching justice. I write this from memory, but I believe it is\r\nsubstantially correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. A. CONKLING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. F. A. CONKLING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter, inviting me to be present at a mass meeting of\r\nloyal citizens, to be held at New York on the 4th instant, for the\r\npurpose of expressing gratitude to Lieutenant-General Grant for his signal\r\nservices, was received yesterday. It is impossible for me to attend. I\r\napprove, nevertheless, of whatever may tend to strengthen and sustain\r\nGeneral Grant and the noble armies now under his direction. My previous\r\nhigh estimate of General Grant has been maintained and heightened by what\r\nhas occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting, while the\r\nmagnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than\r\nI expected. He and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great\r\ntrial, and I trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words\r\nthat they may turn to men and guns, moving to his and their support.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON A LETTER TOUCHING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nJUNE 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nSwett is unquestionably all right. Mr. Holt is a good man, but I had not\r\nheard or thought of him for Vice-President. Wish not to interfere about\r\nVice-President. Cannot interfere about platform. Convention must judge for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nPrivate James McCarthy, of the One-hundred and fortieth New York\r\nVolunteers, is here under sentence to the Dry Tortugas for an attempt to\r\ndesert. His friends appeal to me and if his colonel and you consent, I\r\nwill send him to his regiment. Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS. WASHINGTON, June 8, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. I am unable to conceive how a message can be\r\nless safe by the express than by a staff-officer. If you send a verbal\r\nmessage, the messenger is one additional person let into the secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE COMMITTEE NOTIFYING PRESIDENT LINCOLN OF HIS RENOMINATION,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:\r\n\r\nI will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of\r\nmy gratitude that the Union people, through their convention, in their\r\ncontinued effort to save and advance the nation, have deemed me not\r\nunworthy to remain in my present position. I know no reason to doubt\r\nthat I shall accept the nomination tendered; and yet perhaps I should\r\nnot declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the\r\nplatform. I will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor of\r\nso amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation.\r\nWhen the people in revolt, with a hundred days of explicit notice that\r\nthey could within those days resume their allegiance without the overthrow\r\nof their institution, and that they could not so resume it afterward,\r\nelected to stand out, such amendment of the Constitution as now proposed\r\nbecame a fitting and necessary conclusion to the final success of\r\nthe Union cause. Such alone can meet and cover all cavils. Now the\r\nunconditional Union men, North and South, perceive its importance and\r\nembrace it. In the joint names of Liberty and Union, let us labor to give\r\nit legal form and practical effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATFORM OF THE UNION NATIONAL CONVENTION HELD IN BALTIMORE, MD., JUNE 7\r\nAND 8, 1864.\r\n\r\n1. Resolved, That it is the highest duty of every American citizen to\r\nmaintain against all their enemies the integrity of the Union and the\r\nparamount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States;\r\nand that, laying aside all differences of political opinion, we pledge\r\nourselves, as Union men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming at\r\na common object, to do everything in our power to aid the Government in\r\nquelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its authority,\r\nand in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the rebels and\r\ntraitors arrayed against it.\r\n\r\n2. Resolved, That we approve the determination of the Government of the\r\nUnited States not to compromise with rebels, or to offer them any terms\r\nof peace, except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of\r\ntheir hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States, and that we call upon the Government to\r\nmaintain this position, and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible\r\nvigor to the complete suppression of the rebellion, in full reliance\r\nupon the self-sacrificing patriotism, the heroic valor, and the\r\nundying devotion of the American people to their Country and its free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n3. Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the\r\nstrength, of this rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere,\r\nhostile to the principles of republican government, justice and the\r\nnational safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil\r\nof the republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and\r\nproclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a\r\ndeath-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an\r\namendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with\r\nits provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of\r\nslavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n4. Resolved, That the thanks of the American people are due to the\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy, who have periled their lives in\r\ndefense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag; that\r\nthe nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism\r\nand their valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of their\r\nsurvivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service\r\nof the country; and that the memories of those who have fallen in its\r\ndefense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance.\r\n\r\n5. Resolved, That we approve and applaud the practical wisdom, the\r\nunselfish patriotism, and the unswerving fidelity to the Constitution\r\nand the principles of American liberty, with which Abraham Lincoln has\r\ndischarged under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty the great duties\r\nand responsibilities of the Presidential office; that we approve and\r\nindorse as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of\r\nthe nation, and as within the provisions of the Constitution, the measures\r\nand acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open\r\nand secret foes; that we approve, especially, the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation, and the employment as Union soldiers of men heretofore held\r\nin slavery; and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry\r\nthese and all other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of\r\nthe country into full and complete effect.\r\n\r\n6. Resolved, That we deem it essential to the General welfare that harmony\r\nshould prevail in the national councils, and we regard as worthy of\r\npublic confidence and official trust those only who cordially indorse the\r\nprinciples proclaimed in these resolutions, and which should characterize\r\nthe administration of the Government.\r\n\r\n7. Resolved, That the Government owes to all men employed in its armies,\r\nwithout regard to distinction of color, the full protection of the laws of\r\nwar, and that any violation of these laws, or of the usages of civilized\r\nnations in time of war, by the rebels now in arms, should be made the\r\nsubject of prompt and full redress.\r\n\r\n8. Resolved, That foreign immigration, which in the past has added so much\r\nto the wealth, development of resources, and increase of power to this\r\nnation, the asylum of the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and\r\nencouraged by a liberal and just policy.\r\n\r\n9. Resolved, That we are in favor of the speedy construction of the\r\nrailroad to the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n10. Resolved, That the national faith, pledged for the redemption of\r\nthe public debt, must be kept inviolate, and that for this purpose we\r\nrecommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures, and\r\na vigorous and just system of taxation: and that it is the duty of every\r\nloyal State to sustain the credit and promote the use of the national\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n11. Resolved, That we approve the position taken by the Government that\r\nthe people of the United States can never regard with indifference the\r\nattempt of any European power to overthrow by force or to supplant\r\nby fraud the institutions of any republican government on the Western\r\nContinent, and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to\r\nthe peace and independence of their own country, the efforts of any such\r\npower to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments, sustained by\r\nforeign military force, in near proximity to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A DELEGATION FROM THE NATIONAL UNION LEAGUE,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN--I can only say in response to the remarks of your chairman,\r\nthat I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded\r\nto me, both by the convention and by the National League. I am not\r\ninsensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this, yet I do\r\nnot allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to\r\nbe appropriated as a personal compliment to me. The convention and the\r\nnation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests\r\nof the country, for the present and the great future, and the part I am\r\nentitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay\r\nhold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I\r\nam not entirely unworthy to be intrusted with the place I have occupied\r\nfor the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to\r\nconclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded in this\r\nconnection of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion\r\nonce that \"it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A DELEGATION FROM OHIO,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I am very much obliged to you for this compliment. I have just\r\nbeen saying, and will repeat it, that the hardest of all speeches I have\r\nto answer is a serenade. I never know what to say on these occasions. I\r\nsuppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the action\r\nof the Baltimore convention, which has recently taken place, and with\r\nwhich, of course, I am very well satisfied. What we want still more than\r\nBaltimore conventions, or Presidential elections, is success under General\r\nGrant. I propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support you\r\nowe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very first\r\nimportance, and we should therefore bend all our energies to that point.\r\nNow without detaining you any longer, I propose that you help me to close\r\nup what I am now saying with three rousing cheers for General Grant and\r\nthe officers and soldiers under his command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE ENVOY FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS,\r\n\r\nJUNE 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nSIR:--In every light in which the State of the Hawaiian Islands can be\r\ncontemplated, it is an object of profound interest for the United States.\r\nVirtually it was once a colony. It is now a near and intimate neighbor.\r\nIt is a haven of shelter and refreshment for our merchants, fishermen,\r\nseamen, and other citizens, when on their lawful occasions they are\r\nnavigating the eastern seas and oceans. Its people are free, and its\r\nlaws, language, and religion are largely the fruit of our own teaching and\r\nexample. The distinguished part which you, Mr. Minister, have acted in\r\nthe history of that interesting country, is well known here. It gives me\r\npleasure to assure you of my sincere desire to do what I can to render now\r\nyour sojourn in the United States agreeable to yourself, satisfactory to\r\nyour sovereign, and beneficial to the Hawaiian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO AN OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nJUNE 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nSoldiers! I understand you have just come from Ohio; come to help us in\r\nthis the nation's day of trial, and also of its hopes. I thank you for\r\nyour promptness in responding to the call for troops. Your services were\r\nnever needed more than now. I know not where you are going. You may stay\r\nhere and take the places of those who will be sent to the front, or you\r\nmay go there yourselves. Wherever you go I know you will do your best.\r\nAgain I thank you. Good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL L. THOMAS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 13,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that in the vicinity of Henderson, our militia\r\nis seizing negroes and carrying them off without their own consent, and\r\naccording to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence. I wish\r\nyou would look into this and inform me, and see that the making soldiers\r\nof negroes is done according to the rules you are acting upon, so that\r\nunnecessary provocation and irritation be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO THOMAS WEBSTER. WASHINGTON, D. C., June 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WEBSTER, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nWill try to leave here Wednesday afternoon, say at 4 P.M., remain till\r\nThursday afternoon and then return. This subject to events.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, June 15, 1864. 7 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nI have just received your dispatch of 1 P.M. yesterday. I begin to see it:\r\nyou will succeed. God bless you all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT A SANITARY FAIR IN PHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nJUNE 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nI suppose that this toast is intended to open the way for me to say\r\nsomething. War at the best is terrible, and this of ours in its magnitude\r\nand duration is one of the most terrible the world has ever known. It\r\nhas deranged business totally in many places, and perhaps in all. It has\r\ndestroyed property, destroyed life, and ruined homes. It has produced a\r\nnational debt and a degree of taxation unprecedented in the history of\r\nthis country. It has caused mourning among us until the heavens may\r\nalmost be said to be hung in black. And yet it continues. It has had\r\naccompaniments not before known in the history of the world. I mean the\r\nSanitary and Christian Commissions, with their labors for the relief of\r\nthe soldiers, and the Volunteer Refreshment Saloons, understood better by\r\nthose who hear me than by myself, and these fairs, first begun at Chicago\r\nand next held in Boston, Cincinnati, and other cities. The motive and\r\nobject that lie at the bottom of them are worthy of the most that we can\r\ndo for the soldier who goes to fight the battles of his country. From the\r\nfair and tender hand of women is much, very much, done for the soldier,\r\ncontinually reminding him of the care and thought for him at home. The\r\nknowledge that he is not forgotten is grateful to his heart. Another\r\nview of these institutions is worthy of thought. They are voluntary\r\ncontributions, giving proof that the national resources are not at all\r\nexhausted, and that the national patriotism will sustain us through all.\r\nIt is a pertinent question, When is this war to end? I do not wish to name\r\nthe day when it will end, lest the end should not come at the given time.\r\nWe accepted this war, and did not begin it. We accepted it for an object,\r\nand when that object is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God\r\nthat it will never end until that object is accomplished. We are going\r\nthrough with our task, so far as I am concerned, if it takes us three\r\nyears longer. I have not been in the habit of making predictions, but I\r\nam almost tempted now to hazard one. I will. It is, that Grant is this\r\nevening in a position, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania, whence he\r\ncan never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond is taken. If I shall\r\ndiscover that General Grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture\r\nof Richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the\r\nbriefest notice, will you go? Will you march on with him? [Cries of \"Yes,\r\nyes.\"] Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTORNEY-GENERAL BATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, Jun. 24, 1864\r\n\r\nHONORABLE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSIR:--By authority of the Constitution, and moved thereto by the fourth\r\nsection of the act of Congress, entitled \"An act making appropriations\r\nfor the support of the army for the year ending the thirtieth of June,\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-five, and for other purposes, approved June\r\nis, 1864,\" I require your opinion in writing as to what pay, bounty,\r\nand clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the\r\nnineteenth day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered\r\ninto the military service of the United States between the month of\r\nDecember, 1862, and the sixteenth of June, 1864.\r\n\r\nPlease answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15,\r\n1864, had not been passed, and I will so use your opinion as to satisfy\r\nthat act.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Boston, Massachusetts:\r\n\r\nAll well and very warm. Tad and I have been to General Grant's army.\r\nReturned yesterday safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS. WASHINGTON, June 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that General Brown does not do his best to\r\nsuppress bushwhackers. Please ascertain and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM DENNISON AND OTHERS, a Committee of the Union National\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of the 14th inst.., formally notifying me that I\r\nhave been nominated by the convention you represent for the Presidency\r\nof the United States for four years from the 4th of March next, has been\r\nreceived. The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the resolutions of the\r\nconvention, called the platform, are heartily approved.\r\n\r\nWhile the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government\r\nupon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there might be\r\nmisunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the Government in\r\nrelation to the action of France in Mexico, as assumed through the State\r\nDepartment and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of\r\nthe Executive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts\r\nshall leave that position pertinent and applicable.\r\n\r\nI am especially gratified that the soldier and seaman were not forgotten\r\nby the convention, as they forever must and will be remembered by the\r\ngrateful country for whose salvation they devote their lives.\r\n\r\nThanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in which you have\r\ncommunicated the nomination and other proceedings of the convention, I\r\nsubscribe myself,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL P. STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 29, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE:\r\n\r\nI understand that Congress declines to admit to seats the persons sent as\r\nSenators and Representatives from Arkansas. These persons apprehend that,\r\nin consequence, you may not support the new State government there as you\r\notherwise would. My wish is that you give that government and the people\r\nthere the same support and protection that you would if the members had\r\nbeen admitted, because in no event, nor in any view of the case, can this\r\ndo any harm, while it will be the best you can do toward suppressing the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point:\r\n\r\nDr. Worster wishes to visit you with a view of getting your permission to\r\nintroduce into the army \"Harmon's Sandal Sock.\" Shall I give him a pass\r\nfor that object?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO DAVID TOD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. DAVID TOD, Youngstown, Ohio: I have nominated you to be Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in place of Governor Chase, who has resigned. Please come\r\nwithout a moment's delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. L. SCRIPPS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nTo JOHN L. SCRIPPS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Complaint is made to me that you are using your official power\r\nto defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress. I am well satisfied with\r\nMr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man who\r\nmight supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle,\r\nI think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice\r\namong our friends. My wish, therefore, is that you will do just as you\r\nthink fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any of\r\nyour subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his. This is\r\nprecisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a certain\r\nother nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. W. GARRETT. WASHINGTON, July 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nJ. W. GARRETT, President [B. & 0. R. R.], Camden Station:\r\n\r\nYou say telegraphic communication is re-established with Sandy Hook. Well,\r\nwhat does Sandy Hook say about operations of enemy and of Sigel during\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York, Albany:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to inform you that a rebel force, variously\r\nestimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men, have invaded the State\r\nof Maryland, and have taken Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry, and are\r\nthreatening other points; that the public safety requires him to call\r\nupon the State executives for a militia force to repel this invasion. He\r\ntherefore directs me to call on you for a militia force of twelve thousand\r\nmen from your State to serve not more than one hundred days, and to\r\nrequest that you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops to\r\nWashington by rail or steamboat as may be most expeditious.\r\n\r\nPlease favor me with an answer at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nJULY 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April,\r\n1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the\r\nlaws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were,\r\nopposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein\r\nmentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by\r\nlaw; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land\r\nand naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress\r\nthe said insurrections and rebellion; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Congress of the United States, by an act approved on the\r\nthird day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the\r\nPresident of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety\r\nmay require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or any part\r\nthereof; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering\r\nthe existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged\r\nin suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of\r\nthe States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing\r\nthe laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and\r\nGeorgia; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the\r\nUnited States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout\r\nthe United States, in Cases whereby the authority of the President of\r\nthe United States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United\r\nStates, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their\r\ncustody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the\r\nenemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted, or mustered,\r\nor enlisted in, or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United\r\nStates, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law,\r\nor the rules and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed\r\nfor the military and naval service by authority of the President of the\r\nUnited States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against\r\nthe military or naval service; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of\r\nthe insurgents, who have on several occasions entered the said State\r\nof Kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by\r\ndisaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein,\r\nhave not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the\r\ncivil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and\r\nlife in various parts of the State; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, it has been made known to the President of the United States, by\r\nthe officers commanding the National armies, that combinations have been\r\nformed in the said State of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel\r\nforces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State,\r\nand thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the\r\nsaid States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by\r\nvirtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws, do\r\nhereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires\r\nthat the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so\r\nproclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be\r\nmade effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of\r\nKentucky, and that martial law be for the present declared therein. I do\r\ntherefore hereby require of the military officers of the said State that\r\nthe privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the\r\nsaid State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law\r\nbe established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation,\r\nthe said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until\r\nthis proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period\r\nwhen the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And\r\nI do hereby require and command, as well as military officers, all civil\r\nofficers and authorities existing or found within the said State of\r\nKentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect\r\nto the same. The martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that\r\nrespect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the\r\nholding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional\r\nLegislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the\r\ncourts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in\r\nsuits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the\r\nconstituted authorities of the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington this 5th day of July, in the year of our\r\nLord 1864, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. By the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FOR A DAY OF PRAYER, JULY 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last session\r\nadopted a concurrent resolution, which was approved on the second day of\r\nJuly instant, and which `was in the words following, namely:\r\n\r\nThat the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day of\r\nhumiliation and prayer by the people of the United States, that he request\r\nhis constitutional advisers at the head of the Executive Departments\r\nto unite with him, as Chief Magistrate of the nation, at the City of\r\nWashington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all\r\nloyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship,\r\nor wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold\r\nsins, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that,\r\nif consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily\r\nsuppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him, as\r\nthe Supreme Ruler of the world, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer\r\nus to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations, or by\r\nobstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with His\r\neternal, purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the nation\r\nto know and do His will, humbly believing that it is in accordance with\r\nHis will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the\r\nfamily of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders, and\r\nthe masses of the people, that courage, power of resistance, and endurance\r\nnecessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness\r\nto soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the conscience of\r\nthose in rebellion, that they may lay down their arms, and speedily return\r\nto their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly\r\ndestroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and\r\nfraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the `United States,\r\ncordially concurring with the Congress of the United States, in the\r\npenitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions,\r\nand heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do\r\nhereby appoint the first Thursday of August next to be observed by the\r\npeople of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer.\r\n\r\nI do hereby further invite and request the heads of the Executive\r\nDepartments of this Government, together with all legislators, all judges\r\nand magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land,\r\nwhether civil, military, or naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines\r\nin the national service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the\r\nUnited States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on\r\nthat day, and there to render to the Almighty and merciful Ruler of the\r\nUniverse, such homage and such confessions, and to offer to Him such\r\nsupplications as the Congress of the United States have, in their\r\naforesaid resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this\r\nseventh day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\r\nand sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 7th, with inclosures, received.\r\n\r\nIf you can find any person, anywhere, professing to have any proposition\r\nof Jefferson Davis in writing, for peace, embracing the restoration of the\r\nUnion and abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he\r\nmay come to me with you; and that if he really brings such proposition,\r\nhe shall at the least have safe conduct with the paper (and without\r\npublicity, if he chooses) to the point where you shall have to meet him.\r\nThe same if there be two or more persons.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. W. GARRETT. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1864\r\n\r\nJ. W. GARRETT, Camden Station:\r\n\r\nWhat have you heard about a battle at Monocacy to-day? We have nothing\r\nabout it here except what you say.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 9, 1864. 11.57 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL L. WALLACE, Commanding Middle Department:\r\n\r\nI am directed by the President to say that you will rally your forces and\r\nmake every possible effort to retard the enemy's march on Baltimore.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General and Chief of Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO T. SWAN AND OTHERS. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 10, 1864. 9.20\r\nA.M.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SWAN AND OTHERS, Baltimore, Maryland:\r\n\r\nYours of last night received. I have not a single soldier but whom is\r\nbeing disposed by the military for the best protection of all. By latest\r\naccounts the enemy is moving on Washington. They cannot fly to either\r\nplace. Let us be vigilant, but keep cool. I hope neither Baltimore nor\r\nWashington will be sacked.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON CITY, July TO, 1864.2 P.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch to General Halleck, referring to what I may think in the\r\npresent emergency, is shown me. General Halleck says we have absolutely no\r\nforce here fit to go to the field. He thinks that with the hundred-day\r\nmen and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely,\r\nBaltimore. Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very\r\nreliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point\r\nvery slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace,\r\nwith some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so\r\nbadly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more\r\nthan to defend Baltimore. What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New\r\nYork will scarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is, that\r\nyou should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring\r\nthe rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the\r\nenemy's forces in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance\r\nto do this, if the movement is prompt. This is what I think upon your\r\nsuggestion, and is not an order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, July 11, 1864. 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYours of 10.30 P.M. yesterday received, and very satisfactory. The enemy\r\nwill learn of Wright's arrival, and then the difficulty will be to unite\r\nWright and Hunter south of the enemy before he will recross the Potomac.\r\nSome firing between Rockville and here now.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 12, 1864. 11.30\r\nAM.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nVague rumors have been reaching us for two or three days that Longstreet's\r\ncorps is also on its way [to] this vicinity. Look out for its absence from\r\nyour front.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM AND LETTER TO HORACE GREELEY. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July\r\n12, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nI suppose you received my letter of the 9th. I have just received yours of\r\nthe 13th, and am disappointed by it. I was not expecting you to send me a\r\nletter, but to bring me a man, or men. Mr. Hay goes to you with my answer\r\nto yours of the 13th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Carried by Major John Hay.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, JULY 15, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Yours of the 13th is just received, and I am disappointed\r\nthat you have not already reached here with those commissioners, if they\r\nwould consent to come on being shown my letter to you of the 9th instant.\r\nShow that and this to them, and if they will come on the terms stated in\r\nthe former, bring them. I not only intend a sincere effort for peace, but\r\nI intend that you shall be a personal witness that it is made.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE CONDUCT FOR CLEMENT C. CLAY AND OTHERS,\r\n\r\nJULY 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States directs that the four persons whose\r\nnames follow, to wit, HON. Clement C. Clay, HON. Jacob Thompson, Professor\r\nJames P. Holcombe, George N. Sanders, shall have safe conduct to the city\r\nof Washington in company with the HON. HORACE GREELEY, and shall be exempt\r\nfrom arrest or annoyance of any kind from any officer of the United States\r\nduring their journey to the said city of Washington.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President: JOHN HAY, Major and Assistant Adjutant-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. [WASHINGTON] July 17. 1864. 11.25 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nIn your dispatch of yesterday to General Sherman, I find the following, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\n\"I shall make a desperate effort to get a position here, which will hold\r\nthe enemy without the necessity of so many men.\"\r\n\r\nPressed as we are by lapse of time I am glad to hear you say this; and yet\r\nI do hope you may find a way that the effort shall not be desperate in the\r\nsense of great loss of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL D. HUNTER WASHINGTON JULY 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER, Harper's Ferry, West Va.\r\n\r\nYours of this morning received. You misconceive. The order you complain of\r\nwas only nominally mine, and was framed by those who really made it with\r\nno thought of making you a scapegoat. It seemed to be General Grant's wish\r\nthat the forces under General Wright and those under you should join and\r\ndrive at the enemy under General Wright. Wright had the larger part of the\r\nforce, but you had the rank. It was thought that you would prefer Crook's\r\ncommanding your part to your serving in person under Wright. That is all\r\nof it. General Grant wishes you to remain in command of the department,\r\nand I do not wish to order otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 18, 1864. 11.25 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Chattahoochee River, Georgia:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening\r\nrecruiting stations near your camps. An act of Congress authorizes this,\r\ngiving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to the Executive\r\nGovernment. It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain\r\nor modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may\r\nrequire. To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending\r\nat the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the\r\nfield as you now cause me to fear. Many of the States were very anxious\r\nfor it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions,\r\nthey would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which,\r\nunlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they\r\ngo to. I still hope advantage from the law; and being a law, it must be\r\ntreated as such by all of us. We here will do what we consistently can to\r\nsave you from difficulties arising out of it. May I ask, therefore, that\r\nyou will give your hearty co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Volunteers will be\r\naccepted under this call for one, two, or three years, as they may elect,\r\nand will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of\r\nservices for which they enlist.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby proclaim, order, and direct that immediately after the 5th\r\nday of September, 1864, being fifty days from the date of this call,\r\na draft for troops to serve for one year shall be had in every town,\r\ntownship, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or county not\r\nso subdivided, to fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this\r\ncall or any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the said\r\n5th day of September, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington, this 18th day of July, A.D. 1864, and of\r\nthe independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SNIDER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN:\r\n\r\nHerewith is the manuscript letter for the gentleman who sent me a cane\r\nthrough your hands. For my life I cannot make out his name; and therefore\r\nI cut it from his letter and pasted it on, as you see. I suppose [sic]\r\nwill remember who he is, and I will thank you to forward him the letter.\r\nHe dates his letter at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF A CANE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM O. SNIDER:\r\n\r\nThe cane you did me the honor to present through Governor Curtin was duly\r\nplaced in my hand by him. Please accept my thanks; and, at the same time,\r\npardon me for not having sooner found time to tender them. Your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN HAY TO J. C. WELLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nJ. C. WELLING, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--According to the request contained in your note, I have placed Mr.\r\nGibson's letter of resignation in the hands of the President. He has read\r\nthe letter, and says he accepts the resignation, as he will be glad to\r\ndo with any other, which may be tendered, as this is, for the purpose of\r\ntaking an attitude of hostility against him.\r\n\r\nHe says he was not aware that he was so much indebted to Mr. Gibson for\r\nhaving accepted the office at first, not remembering that he ever pressed\r\nhim to do so, or that he gave it otherwise than as was usual, upon request\r\nmade on behalf of Mr. Gibson.\r\n\r\nHe thanks Mr. Gibson for his acknowledgment that he has been treated with\r\npersonal kindness and consideration, and says he knows of but two small\r\ndrawbacks upon Mr. Gibson's right to still receive such treatment, one\r\nof which is that he never could learn of his giving much attention to\r\nthe duties of his office, and the other is this studied attempt of Mr.\r\nGibson's to stab him.\r\n\r\nI am very truly,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL, FIRST N. Y. VETERAN CAVALRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, JULY 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nThomas Connor, a private in the First Veteran New York Cavalry, is now\r\nimprisoned at hard labor for desertion. If the Colonel of said Regiment\r\nwill say in writing on this sheets that he is willing to receive him back\r\nto the Regiment, I will pardon, and send him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 26, 1864. 2.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, near Atlanta:\r\n\r\nI have just seen yours complaining of the appointment of Hovey and\r\nOsterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good one, and yet\r\nplease hear a word from us. My recollection is that both General Grant\r\nand yourself recommended both H [ovey] and O [sterhaus] for promotion, and\r\nthese, with other strong recommendations, drew committals from us which we\r\ncould neither honorably or safely disregard. We blamed H [ovey] for coming\r\naway in the manner in which he did, but he knew he had apparent reason to\r\nfeel disappointed and mortified, and we felt it was not best to crush one\r\nwho certainly had been a good soldier. As to [Osterhaus], we did not know\r\nof his leaving at the time we made the appointment, and do not now\r\nknow the terms on which he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case\r\nappeared to us at the time, would have been almost, if not quite, a\r\nviolation of our word. The word was given on what we thought was high\r\nmerit and somewhat on his nationality. I beg you to believe we do not act\r\nin a spirit of disregarding merit. We expect to await your programme for\r\nfurther changes and promotions in your army. My profoundest thanks to you\r\nand your whole army for the present campaign so far.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, July 27, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army:\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--Lieutenant-General Grant having signified that, owing to the\r\ndifficulties and delay of communication between his headquarters and\r\nWashington, it is necessary that in the present emergency military orders\r\nmust be issued directly from Washington, the President directs me to\r\ninstruct you that all the military operations for the defense of the\r\nMiddle Department, the Department of the Susquehanna, the Department of\r\nWashington, and the Department of West Virginia, and all the forces in\r\nthose departments, are placed under your general command, and that you\r\nwill be expected to take all military measures necessary for defense\r\nagainst any attack of the enemy and for his capture and destruction.\r\nYou will issue from time to time such orders to the commanders of the\r\nrespective departments and to the military authorities therein as may be\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. WASHINGTON, July 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYours in relation to General A. C. Gillam just received. Will look after\r\nthe matter to-day.\r\n\r\nI also received yours about General Carl Schurz. I appreciate him\r\ncertainly, as highly as you do; but you can never know until you have the\r\ntrial, how difficult it is to find a place for an officer of so high rank\r\nwhen there is no place seeking him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. ANNE WILLIAMSON,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMrs. ANNE WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\nMADAM:--The plaid you send me is just now placed in my hands. I thank you\r\nfor that pretty and useful present, but still more for those good wishes\r\nfor myself and our country, which prompted you to present it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT, AUGUST 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, August 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:--This note will introduce to you Mr. Schley of Baltimore,\r\nwho desires to appeal to you for the revocation of an order of General\r\nHunter, removing some persons, citizens of Frederick, beyond his lines,\r\nand imprisoning others. This Department has no information of the reasons\r\nor proofs on which General Hunter acts, and I do not therefore feel\r\nat liberty to suspend or interfere with his action except under your\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will suspend the order of General Hunter mentioned\r\nwithin, until further order and direct him to send to the Department a\r\nbrief report of what is known against each one proposed to be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U, S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n(Cipher.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.. August 3, 1864\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch in which you say, \"I want Sheridan put in\r\ncommand of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself\r\nsouth of the enemy, and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemy goes,\r\nlet our troops go also.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is exactly right as to how our forces should move; but\r\nplease look over the despatches you may have received from here, ever\r\nsince you made that order, and discover, if you can, that there is any\r\nidea in the head of any one here of \"putting our army south of the enemy,\"\r\nor of following him to the \"death,\" in any direction. I repeat to you,\r\nit will neither be done nor attempted, unless you watch it every day and\r\nhour, and force it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     [Here the President was mistaken in thinking that Sherman,\r\n     Sheridan, and Grant had the same inability of most of his\r\n     previous general officers.  No one needed to watch Grant or\r\n     Sherman or Sheridan, they only needed to get out of their\r\n     way.

HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nYours to Major Hay about publication of our correspondence received. With\r\nthe suppression of a few passages in your letters in regard to which I\r\nthink you and I would not disagree, I should be glad of the publication.\r\nPlease come over and see me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 8, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nI telegraphed you Saturday. Did you receive the despatch? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DISLOYAL FAMILY MEMBER\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. O. BURBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 8, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURBRIDGE, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nLast December Mrs. Emily T. Helm, half-sister of Mrs. Lincoln, and widow\r\nof the rebel general, Ben Hardin Helm, stopped here on her way from\r\nGeorgia to Kentucky, and I gave her a paper, as I remember, to protect her\r\nagainst the mere fact of her being General Helm's widow. I hear a rumor\r\nto-day that you recently sought to arrest her, but were prevented by her\r\npresenting the paper from me. I do not intend to protect her against the\r\nconsequences of disloyal words or acts, spoken or done by her since her\r\nreturn to Kentucky, and if the paper given her by me can be construed\r\nto give her protection for such words and acts, it is hereby revoked pro\r\ntanto. Deal with her for current conduct just as you would with any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 14, 1864. 1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and I concur that you had better confer with General\r\nLee, and stipulate for a mutual discontinuance of house-burning and other\r\ndestruction of private property. The time and manner of conference and\r\nparticulars of stipulation we leave, on our part, to your convenience and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 15,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, near Atlanta, Ga.:\r\n\r\nIf the Government should purchase, on its own account, cotton northward of\r\nyou, and on the line of your communications, would it be an inconvenience\r\nto you, or detriment to the military service, for it to come to the north\r\non the railroad?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH JOHN T. MILLS,\r\n\r\nAUGUST [15?], 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said Governor Randall, \"why can't you seek seclusion, and\r\nplay hermit for a fortnight? It would reinvigorate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the President, \"two or three weeks would do me no good. I\r\ncannot fly from my thoughts--my solicitude for this great country follows\r\nme wherever I go. I do not think it is personal vanity or ambition, though\r\nI am not free from these infirmities, but I cannot but feel that the\r\nweal or woe of this great nation will be decided in November. There is no\r\nprogram offered by any wing of the Democratic party but that must result\r\nin the permanent destruction of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. President, General McClellan is in favor of crushing out this\r\nrebellion by force. He will be the Chicago candidate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that\r\nthe rebel armies cannot be destroyed by Democratic strategy. It would\r\nsacrifice all the white men of the North to do it. There are now in\r\nthe service of the United States nearly one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nable-bodied colored men, most of them under arms, defending and acquiring\r\nUnion territory. The Democratic strategy demands that these forces be\r\ndisbanded, and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to\r\nslavery. The black men who now assist Union prisoners to escape are to be\r\nconverted into our enemies, in the vain hope of gaining the good-will of\r\ntheir masters. We shall have to fight two nations instead of one.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to them ultimate\r\nsuccess; and the experience of the present war proves their success is\r\ninevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men\r\ninto their side of the scale. Will you give our enemies such military\r\nadvantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing, flattery, and\r\nconcession to get them back into the Union? Abandon all the posts now\r\ngarrisoned by black men, take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our\r\nside and put them in the battle-field or corn-field against us, and we\r\nwould be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where are the\r\nDemocrats to do this? It was a free fight, and the field was open to the\r\nwar Democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master\r\nand slave, long before the present policy was inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\"There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the\r\nblack warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the\r\nmasters they fought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time\r\nand eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend and foe.\r\nMy enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of\r\nabolition. So long as I am President, it shall be carried on for the\r\nsole purpose of restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this\r\nrebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and every other\r\npolicy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men, raised on\r\nSouthern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has subtracted\r\nfrom the enemy, and, instead of alienating the South, there are now\r\nevidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank\r\nand file of the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country that\r\nthe destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the Union.\r\nI will abide the issue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDORSEMENT OF APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, AUGUST 15, 1864.\r\n\r\nI am always for the man who wishes to work; and I shall be glad for this\r\nman to get suitable employment at Cavalry Depot, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. J. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 15, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY J. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have proposed to Mr. Greeley that the Niagara\r\ncorrespondence be published, suppressing only the parts of his letters\r\nover which the red pencil is drawn in the copy which I herewith send. He\r\ndeclines giving his consent to the publication of his letters unless these\r\nparts be published with the rest. I have concluded that it is better for\r\nme to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the false position\r\nin which I consider he has placed me, than to subject the country to the\r\nconsequences of publishing these discouraging and injurious parts. I send\r\nyou this, and the accompanying copy, not for publication, but merely to\r\nexplain to you, and that you may preserve them until their proper time\r\nshall come.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold\r\nwhere you are. Neither am I willing. Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew\r\nand choke as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS, AUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the act of Congress of the 28th of September, 1850, entitled \"An\r\nact to create additional collection districts in the State of California,\r\nand to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing\r\ncollection districts in the United States,\" extends to merchandise\r\nwarehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North\r\nAmerican provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed\r\nin the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1845, which designates certain\r\nfrontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further\r\nprovides \"that such other ports, situated on the frontiers of the United\r\nStates adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter\r\nbe found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges, on the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly\r\nmade by the President of the United States, specially designating the\r\nports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended.\"\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of Newport, in the\r\nState of Vermont, is and shall be entitled to all the privileges in regard\r\nto the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American\r\nprovinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports\r\nenumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\neighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica, the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT CONCERNING AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, AUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nIf General Hitchcock can effect a special exchange of Thomas D. Armesy,\r\nnow under conviction as a spy, or something of the sort, and in prison\r\nat for Major Nathan Goff, made a prisoner of war, and now in prison at\r\nRichmond, let it be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE 164TH OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS:--You are about to return to your homes and your friends, after\r\nhaving, as I learn, performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty\r\nin this great contest. I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who\r\nhave come forward at the call of their country. I wish it might be more\r\ngenerally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in.\r\nWe have, as all will agree, a free government, where every man has a right\r\nto be equal with every other man. In this great struggle, this form of\r\ngovernment and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies\r\nsucceed. There is more involved in this contest than is realized by\r\nevery one. There is involved in this struggle, the question whether your\r\nchildren and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed. I say\r\nthis, in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed,\r\nthat no small matter should divert us from our great purpose.\r\n\r\nThere may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system.\r\nIt is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value\r\nof his property; but if we should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust\r\nthe taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we\r\nshould never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made sometimes;\r\nand things may be done wrong, while the officers of the Government do all\r\nthey can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great\r\nRepublic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have\r\nbefore us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by\r\nany small matter. When you return to your homes, rise up to the height of\r\na generation of men worthy of a free government, and we will carry out the\r\ngreat work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers,\r\nfor the honor you have done me this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August\r\n20, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Bermuda Hundred, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease allow Judge Snead to go to his family on Eastern Shore, or give me\r\nsome good reason why not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE 166TH OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS--I suppose you are going home to see your families and friends.\r\nFor the services you have done in this great struggle in which we are\r\nengaged, I present you sincere thanks for myself and the country.\r\n\r\nI almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to soldiers, to impress\r\nupon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this\r\ncontest. It is not merely for the day, but for all time to come, that\r\nwe should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free\r\ngovernment which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember\r\nthis, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen, temporarily, to\r\noccupy this big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your\r\nchildren may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order\r\nthat each one of you may have, through this free government which we have\r\nenjoyed, an open field, and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise,\r\nand intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of\r\nlife with all its desirable human aspirations--it is for this that the\r\nstruggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthrights--not\r\nonly for one, but for two or three years, if necessary. The nation is\r\nworth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 23, 1864.\r\n\r\nThis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that\r\nthis administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to\r\nso co-operate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the\r\nelection and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on\r\nsuch ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 26,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nThanks to General Gillam for making the news and also to you for sending\r\nit. Does Joe Heiskell's \"walking to meet us\" mean any more than that \"Joe\"\r\nwas scared and wanted to save his skin?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO B. H. BREWSTER. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August\r\n30,1864.\r\n\r\nHON. B. H. BREWSTER, Astor House, New York:\r\n\r\nYour letter of yesterday received. Thank you for it.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING COTTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 31, 1864.\r\n\r\nAny person or persons engaged in bringing out cotton, in strict conformity\r\nwith authority given by W. P. Fessenden, Secretary of the United States\r\nTreasury, must not be hindered by the War, Navy, or any other Department\r\nof the Government, or any person engaged under any of said Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUIDEKOPER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 1, 1864\r\n\r\nCOLONEL H. C. HUIDEKOPER, Meadville, Penn.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Illinois, as\r\nrebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth who are\r\nunwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath\r\nof allegiance and enter the military service of the Union. Colonel\r\nHuidekoper, on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania, wishes\r\nto pay the bounties the Government would have to pay to proper persons\r\nof this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be\r\ncredited to the localities furnishing the bounty money. He will therefore\r\nproceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not\r\nincluding any who have attractions Southward), and telegraph them to\r\nthe Provost-Marshal-General here, whereupon direction will be given to\r\ndischarge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and\r\nthen upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been\r\nduly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their\r\nnumber will be credited as may be directed by Colonel Huidekoper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command before\r\nAtlanta, for the distinguished ability, courage, and perseverance\r\ndisplayed in the campaign in Georgia, which under Divine power resulted\r\nin the capture of the city of Atlanta. The marches, battles, sieges, and\r\nother military operations that have signalized this campaign must\r\nrender it famous in the annals of war, and have entitled those who have\r\nparticipated therein to the applause and thanks of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

GURNEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nELIZA P. GURNEY.\r\n\r\nMY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I have not forgotten probably never shall forget the\r\nvery impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a Sabbath\r\nforenoon two years ago--nor has your kind letter, written nearly a\r\nyear later, even been for gotten. In all, it has been your purpose to\r\nstrengthen my reliance on God. I am much indebted to the good Christian\r\npeople of the country for their constant prayer and consolations; and to\r\nno one of them, more than to yourself. The purposes of the Almighty are\r\nperfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately\r\nperceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this\r\nterrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled\r\notherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our own error therein.\r\nMean while we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting\r\nthat so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains. Surely He\r\nintends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal\r\ncould make, and no mortal could stay.\r\n\r\nYour people--the Friends--have had, and are having, a very great trial.\r\nOn principle, and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can\r\nonly practically oppose oppression by war. For those appealing to me on\r\nconscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and\r\ncan, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law. That you believe this\r\nI doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and\r\nmyself your earnest prayers to our Father in Heaven.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE OF COLORED PEOPLE FROM BALTIMORE\r\n\r\nWHO PRESENTED HIM WITH A BIBLE,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nI can only say now, as I have often said before, it has always been a\r\nsentiment with me, that all mankind should be free. So far as I have been\r\nable, so far as came within my sphere, I have always acted as I believed\r\nwas just and right, and done all I could for the good of mankind. I have,\r\nin letters sent forth from this office, expressed myself better than I can\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the great Book, I have only to say it is the best gift which\r\nGod has ever given to man. All the good from the Saviour of the world is\r\ncommunicated to us through this book. But for that Book, we could not know\r\nright from wrong. All those things desirable to man are contained in it. I\r\nreturn you sincere thanks for this very elegant copy of this great Book of\r\nGod which you present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PICKERING.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 8, 1864:\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PICKERING, Olympia, W. T.:\r\n\r\nYour patriotic despatch of yesterday received and will be published.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF THANKS TO HUNDRED-DAY TROOPS FROM OHIO.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, September 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio\r\nvolunteered having expired, the President directs an official\r\nacknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services during\r\nthe recent campaigns. The term of service of their enlistment was short,\r\nbut distinguished by memorable events. In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on\r\nthe Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg\r\nand Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the intrenchments of\r\nWashington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio\r\nperformed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they\r\nare entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their\r\nState, the national thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 12, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nSheridan and Early are facing each other at a dead-lock. Could we not pick\r\nup a regiment here and there, to the number of say ten thousand men, and\r\nquietly but suddenly concentrate them at Sheridan's camp and enable him to\r\nmake a strike?\r\n\r\nThis is but a suggestion.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JAMES G. BLAINE. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September\r\n13, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. J. G. BLAINE, Augusta, Me.: On behalf of the Union, thanks to Maine.\r\nThanks to you personally for sending the news.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Send same to L. B. Smith and M. A. Blanchard, Portland, Me. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September\r\n13, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Saint Louis:\r\n\r\nPostpone the execution of S. H. Anderson for two weeks. Hear what his\r\nfriends can say in mitigation and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nMAJOR ECKERT: Please send the above telegram.\r\n\r\nJNO. G. NICOLAY, Private Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SLOUGH.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SLOUGH, Alexandria, Va.:\r\n\r\nOn the 14th I commuted the sentence of Conley, but fearing you may not\r\nhave received notice I send this. Do not execute him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN. WASHINGTON, D. C., September 17,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia:\r\n\r\nI feel great interest in the subjects of your despatch mentioning corn and\r\nsorghum, and the contemplated visit to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nThe State election of Indiana occurs on the 11th of October, and the loss\r\nof it to the friends of the Government would go far towards losing\r\nthe whole Union cause. The bad effect upon the November election, and\r\nespecially the giving the State government to those who will oppose the\r\nwar in every possible way, are too much to risk if it can be avoided. The\r\ndraft proceeds, notwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the State.\r\nIndiana is the only important State voting in October whose soldiers\r\ncannot vote in the field. Anything you can safely do to let her soldiers\r\nor any part of them go home and vote at the State election will be greatly\r\nin point. They need not remain for the Presidential election, but may\r\nreturn to you at once. This is in no sense an order, but is merely\r\nintended to impress you with the importance to the Army itself of your\r\ndoing all you safely can, yourself being the judge of what you can safely\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT CONCERNING AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, SEPTEMBER 1864.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this, who appeals for his brother, is our minister to\r\nEcuador, and whom, if at all compatible, I would like to have obliged by a\r\nspecial exchange of his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL P. SHERIDAN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September\r\n20, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Winchester, Va.:\r\n\r\nHave just heard of your great victory. God bless you all, officers and\r\nmen. Strongly inclined to come up and See you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HITCHCOCK,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HITCHCOCK:\r\n\r\nPlease see the bearer, Mr. Broadwell, on a question about a mutual\r\nsupplying of clothes to prisoners.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI send this as an explanation to you, and to do justice to the Secretary\r\nof War. I was induced, upon pressing application, to authorize the agents\r\nof one of the districts of Pennsylvania to recruit in one of the prison\r\ndepots in Illinois; and the thing went so far before it came to the\r\nknowledge of the Secretary that, in my judgment, it could not be abandoned\r\nwithout greater evil than would follow its going through. I did not know\r\nat the time that you had protested against that class of thing being done;\r\nand I now say that while this particular job must be completed, no other\r\nof the sort will be authorized, without an understanding with you, if at\r\nall. The Secretary of War is wholly free of any part in this blunder.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 23, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You have generously said to me, more than once, that\r\nwhenever your resignation could be a relief to me, it was at my disposal.\r\nThe time has come. You very well know that this proceeds from no\r\ndissatisfaction of mine with you personally or officially. Your uniform\r\nkindness has been unsurpassed by that of any other friend, and while it\r\nis true that the war does not so greatly add to the difficulties of your\r\ndepartment as to those of some others, it is yet much to say, as I most\r\ntruly can, that in the three years and a half during which you have\r\nadministered the General Post-Office, I remember no single complaint\r\nagainst you in connection therewith.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS IN INSURRECTIONARY STATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, September 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nI.

C., September 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia:\r\n\r\nYou say Jefferson Davis is on a visit to Hood. I judge that Brown and\r\nStephens are the objects of his visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D.C., September 29,1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI hope it will have no constraint on you, nor do harm any way, for me to\r\nsay I am a little afraid lest Lee sends reinforcements to Early, and thus\r\nenables him to turn upon Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT.\r\n\r\nSeptember 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nI think the bearer of this, Second Lieutenant Albee, deserves a hearing.\r\nWill the Secretary of War please accord it to him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RETURNING THANKS TO THE VOLUNTEERS FOR ONE HUNDRED DAYS\r\n\r\nFROM THE STATES OF INDIANA, ILLINOIS, IOWA, AND WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 1, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which volunteers from the States of\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin volunteered, under the call of\r\ntheir respective governors, in the months of May and June, to aid in the\r\ncampaign of General Sherman, having expired; the President directs an\r\nofficial acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic service. It was\r\ntheir good fortune to render efficient service in the brilliant operations\r\nin the Southwest and to contribute to the victories of the national arms\r\nover the rebel forces in Georgia under command of Johnston and Hood. On\r\nall occasions and in every service to which they were assigned their duty\r\nas patriotic volunteers was performed with alacrity and courage, for which\r\nthey are entitled to and are hereby tendered the national thanks through\r\nthe governors of their respective States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is directed to transmit a copy of this order to\r\nthe governors of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin and to cause a\r\ncertificate of their honorable service to be delivered to the officers\r\nand soldiers of the States above named who recently served in the military\r\nforce of the United States as volunteers for one hundred days.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 5, 1864\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI inclose you a copy of a correspondence in regard to a contemplated\r\nexchange of naval prisoners through your lines, and not very distant from\r\nyour headquarters. It only came to the knowledge of the War Department and\r\nof myself yesterday, and it gives us some uneasiness. I therefore send it\r\nto you with the statement that, as the numbers to be exchanged under it\r\nare small, and so much has already been done to effect the exchange, I\r\nhope you may find it consistent to let it go forward under the general\r\nsupervision of General Butler, and particularly in reference to the points\r\nhe holds vital in exchanges. Still, you are at liberty to arrest the whole\r\noperation if in your judgment the public good requires it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON A MEMORANDUM BY GENERAL McDOWELL, OCTOBER 7, 1864\r\n\r\nI well remember the meetings herein narrated. See nothing for me to object\r\nto in the narrative as being made by General McDowell, except the phrase\r\nattributed to me \"of the Jacobinism of Congress\",\r\n\r\n     [This memorandum describes the private discussions that\r\n     preceded the transfer of McClellan's army from the Potomac,\r\n     where it had confronted the Confederates at Manassas. See H.\r\n     J. Raymond: Life of Lincoln, p. 772]\r\n\r\nwhich phrase I do not remember using literally or in substance, and which\r\nI wish not to be published in any event.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. W. HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY W. HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--A convention of Maryland has framed a new constitution for\r\nthe State; a public meeting is called for this evening at Baltimore to aid\r\nin securing its ratification by the people, and you ask a word from me\r\nfor the occasion. I presume the only feature of the instrument about which\r\nthere is serious controversy is that which provides for the extinction of\r\nslavery. It needs not to be a secret and I presume it is no secret, that I\r\nwish success to this provision. I desire it on every consideration. I wish\r\nall men to be free. I wish the material prosperity of the already free,\r\nwhich I feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring. I wish to see in\r\nprocess of disappearing that only thing which ever could bring this nation\r\nto civil war. I attempt no argument. Argument upon the question is already\r\nexhausted by the abler, better informed, and more immediately interested\r\nsons of Maryland herself. I only add that I shall be gratified exceedingly\r\nif the good people of the State shall, by their votes, ratify the new\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 10, 1864, 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day just this moment received, and the Secretary having left\r\nit is impossible for me to answer to-day. I have not received your letter\r\nfrom Erie.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO ROBERT T. LINCOLN, Cambridge, Mass.:\r\n\r\nYour letter makes us a little uneasy about your health. Telegraph us how\r\nyou are. If you think it would help you, make us a visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nSecretary of War not being in, I answer yours about election. Pennsylvania\r\nvery close, and still in doubt on home vote. Ohio largely for us, with\r\nall the members of Congress but two or three. Indiana largely for\r\nus,--Governor, it is said, by fifteen thousand, and eight of the eleven\r\nmembers of Congress. Send us what you may know of your army vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 19, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am notified that this is a compliment paid\r\nme by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District. I infer that the\r\nadoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and\r\nthat in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief\r\nmerit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I congratulate you, and\r\nMaryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event. I regret that\r\nit did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the\r\nnation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to\r\nthe measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends\r\nmay fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its\r\nopponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed.\r\n\r\nA word upon another subject. Something said by the Secretary of State in\r\nhis recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat,\r\nthat if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and\r\nthe end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOthers regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine\r\ndie, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as\r\nthe intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he\r\nwill at once seize control of the Government. I hope the good people will\r\npermit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point. I am struggling\r\nto maintain the Government, not to overthrow it. I am struggling\r\nespecially to prevent others from overthrowing it. I therefore say, that\r\nif I live, I shall remain President until the 4th of next March, and that\r\nwhoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November, shall be duly\r\ninstalled as President on the 4th of March, and in the interval I shall do\r\nmy utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall\r\nstart with the best possible chance of saving the ship. This is due to\r\nthe people, both on principle and under the Constitution. Their will,\r\nconstitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all. If they should\r\ndeliberately resolve to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their\r\ncountry and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to resist\r\nthem. It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their\r\nown. I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country\r\nand their liberties; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to\r\nstand by them. I may add, that in this purpose to save the country and its\r\nliberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers\r\nin the field and the sailors afloat. Do they not have the hardest of it?\r\nWho should quail while they do not? God bless the soldiers and seamen,\r\nwith all their brave commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF THANKSGIVING, OCTOBER 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year,\r\ndefending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from\r\nabroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over\r\nthe enemy, who is of our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly\r\nFather to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in\r\ntheir camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health.\r\nHe has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by\r\nimmigration, while he has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has\r\ncrowned the labor of our working-men in every department of industry with\r\nabundant rewards. Moreover, he has been pleased to animate and inspire our\r\nminds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient\r\nfor the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our\r\nadherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford\r\nto us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our\r\ndangers and afflictions.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day\r\nwhich I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they\r\nmay be then, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the\r\nbeneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do further recommend\r\nto my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on that occasion they do reverently\r\nhumble themselves in the dust, and from thence offer up penitent and\r\nfervent prayers and supplications to the great Disposer of events for\r\na return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony\r\nthroughout the, land which it has pleased him to assign as a\r\ndwelling-place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of October, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM To J. G. NICOLAY. WASHINGTON, D. C., October 21, 1864. 9.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nJ. G. NICOLAY, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWhile Curtis is fighting Price, have you any idea where the force under\r\nRosecrans is, or what it is doing?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSRS WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL, THOMAS A. R. NELSON, JAMES T. P. CARTER, JOHN\r\nWILLIAMS, A. BLIZZARD, HENRY COOPER, BAILLIE PEYTON, JOHN LELLYET, EMERSON\r\nETHERIDGE, and JOHN D. PERRYMAN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed paper\r\nmanuscript, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest, with\r\nyour names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper,\r\npurporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of\r\nTennessee, and also a manuscript paper, purporting to be extracts from the\r\nCode of Tennessee, were laid before me.\r\n\r\nThe protest, proclamation, and extracts are respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n[The protest is here recited, and also the proclamation of Governor\r\nJohnson, dated September 30, to which it refers, together with a list of\r\nthe counties in East, Middle, and West Tennessee; also extracts from the\r\nCode of Tennessee in relation to electors of President and Vice-President,\r\nqualifications of voters for members of the General Assembly, places of\r\nholding elections, and officers of popular elections.]\r\n\r\nAt the time these papers were presented, as before stated, I had never\r\nseen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they related,\r\nexcept in a general way one day previously.\r\n\r\nUp to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the subject has\r\npassed between Governor Johnson, or any one else, connected with the\r\nproclamation, and myself.\r\n\r\nSince receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the subject such brief\r\nconsideration as I have been able to do, in the midst of so many pressing\r\npublic duties.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to\r\nsustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it,\r\nor to revoke or modify it as you demand.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution and laws, the President is charged with no duty in\r\nthe presidential election in any State, nor do I in this case perceive any\r\nmilitary reason for his interference in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not,\r\nas seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive.\r\n\r\nIn no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement\r\nof, at least, a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or coercion towards\r\nany one.\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right\r\nto favor any political plan he chooses, and, as military governor, it is\r\nhis duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the State.\r\n\r\nI cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more. But you object to\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\nLeaving it alone will be your perfect security against it. It is not\r\nproposed to force you into it. Do as you please, on your own account,\r\npeaceably and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will\r\nprotect you against violence as far as in his power.\r\n\r\nI presume that the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee\r\nin strict accordance with the old Code of the State, is not now a\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall be held\r\nand any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military\r\nagents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another\r\ndepartment of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be\r\ncounted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nExcept it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere\r\nin any way with any presidential election.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October\r\n22, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:\r\n\r\nWith great pleasure I tender to you and your brave army the thanks of\r\nthe nation, and my own personal admiration and gratitude, for the month's\r\noperations in the Shenandoah Valley; and especially for the splendid work\r\nof October 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Auburn, New York:\r\n\r\nNews from Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Rosecrans satisfactory, but not\r\nimportant. Pirate Florida captured by the Wachusett October 7, on the\r\ncoast of Brazil. The information is certain.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--Even before I had been informed by you that\r\nthis compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania, friendly\r\nto me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who\r\nthink that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the\r\nsupport of the present administration. I do not pretend to say that you,\r\nwho think so, embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country, but I\r\ndo believe, and I trust without personal interest, that the welfare of the\r\ncountry does require that such support and indorsement should be given.\r\n\r\nI earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as\r\nyou assume, and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage,\r\nif not to the very salvation, of the country. I cannot at this hour say\r\nwhat has been the result of the election. But, whatever it may be, I have\r\nno desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day in\r\nbehalf of the Union have wrought for the best interests of the country and\r\nthe world; not only for the present, but for all future ages.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but, while deeply\r\ngrateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my\r\ngratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph. I do not impugn the\r\nmotives of any one opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to triumph\r\nover any one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of\r\nthe people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. W. HOFFMAN. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C. November 10,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nH. HOFFMAN, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nThe Maryland soldiers in the Army of the Potomac cast a total vote of\r\nfourteen hundred and twenty-eight, out of which we get eleven hundred and\r\nsixty majority. This is directly from General Meade and General Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong\r\nfor the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its\r\nexistence in great emergencies. On this point the present rebellion\r\nbrought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election\r\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nIf the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the\r\nrebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by\r\na political war among themselves? But the election was a necessity. We\r\ncannot have free government without elections; and if the election could\r\nforce us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim\r\nto have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the election is\r\nbut human nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has\r\noccurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases. Human nature will\r\nnot change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of\r\nthis, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and\r\nas good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to\r\nlearn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.\r\n\r\nBut the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has\r\ndone good, too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain\r\na national election in the midst of a great civil war. Until now, it has\r\nnot been known to the world that this was a possibility. It shows, also,\r\nhow sound and strong we still are. It shows that even among the candidates\r\nof the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed\r\nto treason can receive most of the people's votes. It shows, also, to\r\nthe extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war\r\nbegan. Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are\r\nbetter than gold.\r\n\r\nBut the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may\r\nnot all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our\r\ncommon country? For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid\r\nplacing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am duly sensible to\r\nthe high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to\r\nAlmighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as\r\nI think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other\r\nman may be disappointed by the result.\r\n\r\nMay I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this\r\nsame spirit towards those who have? And now, let me close by asking three\r\nhearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and\r\nskillful commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. O. BURBRIDGE. WASHINGTON, D.C., November 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURBRIDGE, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nI have just received a telegram from Governor Bramlette saying: \"General\r\nJohn B. Houston, a loyal man and prominent citizen, was arrested, and\r\nyesterday, started off by General Burbridge, to be sent beyond our lines\r\nby way of Catlettsburg, for no other offense than opposition to your\r\nre-election,\" and I have answered him as follows below, of which please\r\ntake notice and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., November 10, 1864. GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. I can scarcely believe that General John\r\nB. Houston has been arrested \"for no other offense than opposition to my\r\nre-election;\" for, if that had been deemed sufficient cause of arrest, I\r\nshould have heard of more than one arrest in Kentucky on election day.\r\nIf, however, General Houston has been arrested for no other cause than\r\nopposition to my re-election, General Burbridge will discharge him at\r\nonce, I sending him a copy of this as an order to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT:\r\n\r\nFew things since I have been here have impressed me more painfully\r\nthan what, for four or five months past, has appeared a bitter military\r\nopposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I still indulged some\r\nhope that I was mistaken in the fact; but copies of a correspondence\r\non the subject between General Canby and yourself, and shown me to-day,\r\ndispel that hope. A very fair proportion of the people of Louisiana\r\nhave inaugurated a new State government, making an excellent new\r\nconstitution--better for the poor black man than we have in Illinois. This\r\nwas done under military protection, directed by me, in the belief, still\r\nsincerely entertained, that with such a nucleus around which to build we\r\ncould get the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In this\r\nbelief a general promise of protection and support, applicable alike to\r\nLouisiana and other States, was given in the last annual message. During\r\nthe formation of the new government and constitution they were supported\r\nby nearly every loyal person, and opposed by every secessionist. And\r\nthis support and this opposition, from the respective standpoints of the\r\nparties, was perfectly consistent and logical. Every Unionist ought to\r\nwish the new government to succeed; and every disunionist must desire it\r\nto fail. Its failure would gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and\r\nof every enemy of the old flag in the world. Every advocate of slavery\r\nnaturally desires to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the\r\nblack man by the new constitution. But why General Canby and General\r\nHurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the military must\r\nnot be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the Constitutional\r\nConvention, for what it deems a breach of privilege, arrests an editor in\r\nno way connected with the military, the military necessity for insulting\r\nthe convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to\r\nperceive. Neither is the military necessity for protecting the people\r\nagainst paying large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing\r\nvery apparent. Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for\r\nforcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the\r\nState. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no better\r\nthan gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope that they may be shown not\r\nto have occurred. To make assurance against misunderstanding, I repeat\r\nthat in the existing condition of things in Louisiana, the military\r\nmust not be thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on points of\r\ndifference the commanding general must be judge and master. But I also add\r\nthat in the exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious, and\r\nscarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to crush\r\nout the civil government, will not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO MARYLAND UNION COMMITTEE, NOVEMBER 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe President, in reply, said that he had to confess he had been duly\r\nnotified of the intention to make this friendly call some days ago, and in\r\nthis he had had a fair opportunity afforded to be ready with a set speech;\r\nbut he had not prepared one, being too busy for that purpose. He would\r\nsay, however, that he was gratified with the result of the presidential\r\nelection. He had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best\r\njudgment for the interest of the whole country, and to have the seal of\r\napprobation stamped on the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful\r\nto his feelings. He thought he could say, in as large a sense as any other\r\nman, that his pleasure consisted in belief that the policy he had pursued\r\nwas the best, if not the only one, for the safety of the country.\r\n\r\nHe had said before, and now repeated, that he indulged in no feeling of\r\ntriumph over any man who thought or acted differently from himself. He\r\nhad no such feeling toward any living man. When he thought of Maryland, in\r\nparticular, he was of the opinion that she had more than double her share\r\nin what had occurred in the recent elections. The adoption of a free-State\r\nconstitution was a greater thing than the part taken by the people of the\r\nState in the presidential election. He would any day have stipulated to\r\nlose Maryland in the presidential election to save it by the adoption of\r\na free-State constitution, because the presidential election comes every\r\nfour years, while that is a thing which, being done, cannot be undone. He\r\ntherefore thought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a\r\ngreat deal more than their part in the presidential election, though\r\nof the latter he thought highly. He had once before said, but would say\r\nagain, that those who have differed with us and opposed us will see that\r\nthe result of the presidential election is better for their own good than\r\nif they had been successful.\r\n\r\nThanking the committee for their compliment, he brought his brief speech\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING BLOCKADE, NOVEMBER 19, 1864\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas by my proclamation of the 19th of April, 1861, it was declared\r\nthat the ports of certain States, including those of Norfolk, in the State\r\nof Virginia, Fernandina and Pensacola, in the State of Florida, were, for\r\nreasons therein set forth, intended to be placed under blockade; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly, but having\r\nfor some time past been in the military possession of the United States,\r\nit is deeemd advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign\r\ncommerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled \"An\r\nact further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of\r\nNorfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola shall so far cease and determine, from\r\nand after the first day of December next, that commercial intercourse with\r\nthose ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband of\r\nwar, may, from that time, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United\r\nStates, to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may\r\nbe prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to such military\r\nand naval regulations as are now in force, or may hereafter be found\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\nnineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BIXBY, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM:--I have been shown in the files of the War Department a\r\nstatement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that you are the mother\r\nof five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel\r\nhow weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to\r\nbeguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain\r\nfrom tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks\r\nof the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may\r\nassuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished\r\nmemory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to\r\nhave laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely and respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nDEACON JOHN PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have heard of the incident at the polls in your town, in\r\nwhich you acted so honorable a part, and I take the liberty of writing\r\nto you to express my personal gratitude for the compliment paid me by the\r\nsuffrage of a citizen so venerable.\r\n\r\nThe example of such devotion to civic duties in one whose days have\r\nalready been extended an average lifetime beyond the Psalmist's limit,\r\ncannot but be valuable and fruitful. It is not for myself only, but for\r\nthe country which you have in your sphere served so long and so well, that\r\nI thank you.\r\n\r\nYour friend and servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE. WASHINGTON, D. C. NOVEMBER 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. It seems that Lieutenant-Governor Jacobs and\r\nColonel Wolford are stationary now. General Sudarth and Mr. Hodges are\r\nhere, and the Secretary of War and myself are trying to devise means of\r\npacification and harmony for Kentucky, which we hope to effect soon, now\r\nthat the passion-exciting subject of the election is past.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN, WASHINGTON, D.C., NOVEMBER 25, 1864\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania;\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge, information, or belief, that three States--or any\r\nStates, offer to resume allegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C., NOV.\r\n26, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nPlease telegraph me briefly on what charge and evidence Mrs. Anna B.\r\nMartin has been sent to the penitentiary at Alton.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday of last week, two ladies from Tennessee came before the\r\nPresident, asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war\r\nat Johnson's Island. They were put off until Friday, when they came again,\r\nand were again put off until Saturday. At each of the interviews one of\r\nthe ladies urged that her husband was a religious man, and on Saturday the\r\nPresident ordered the release of the prisoners, when he said to this lady:\r\n\"You say your husband is a religious man; tell him when you meet him, that\r\nI say I am not much of a judge of religion, but that, in my opinion, the\r\nreligion that sets men to rebel and fight against their own government,\r\nbecause, as they think, that government does not sufficiently help some\r\nmen to eat their bread in the sweat of other men's faces, is not the sort\r\nof religion upon which people can get to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE STEAMER \"FUNAYMA SOLACE.\"\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nA war steamer, called the Funayma Solace, having been built in this\r\ncountry, for the Japanese government and at the instance of that\r\ngovernment, it is deemed to comport with the public interest, in view of\r\nthe unsettled condition of the relations of the United States with that\r\nEmpire, that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to Japan. If,\r\nhowever, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that the steamer is\r\nadapted to our service, he is authorized to purchase her, but the purchase\r\nmoney will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims which may\r\nbe presented by the Japanese on account of the construction of the steamer\r\nand the failure to deliver the same, as above set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that\r\nCaptain John A. Winslow, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from\r\nCongress for the skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the brilliant\r\naction whilst in command of the United States steamer Keaysarge, which led\r\nto the total destruction of the piratical craft Alabama, on the 19th of\r\nJune, 1864., a vessel superior in tonnage, superior in number of guns, and\r\nsuperior in number of crew.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade, if, upon recommendation by the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy, or far extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Lieutenant William B. Gushing, United States Navy, receive a vote of\r\nthanks from Congress for his important, gallant, and perilous achievement\r\nin destroying the rebel ironclad steamer Albemarle on the night of the\r\n27th of October, 1864., at Plymouth, N. C.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of so formidable a vessel, which had resisted the\r\ncontinued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions, is an\r\nimportant event touching our future naval and military operations, and\r\nwould reflect honor on any officer, and redounds to the credit of this\r\nyoung officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful\r\nand daring undertaking.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the Aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, namely:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy, or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nAgain the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest\r\ngratitude to Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our political\r\nrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the same\r\ntime strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent\r\nengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan\r\nand the port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the\r\ndifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and\r\ncaused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably\r\nadjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon\r\nbe reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We could not\r\nexaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to an important South American State not\r\nto acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the\r\nUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this\r\ngovernment. A claims convention has been constituted to complete the\r\nunfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with\r\nthe universal acquiescence of the people, the government under it has been\r\nrecognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial\r\nand friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has been\r\nsatisfactorily paid and discharged.\r\n\r\nMutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint\r\ncommission for the settlement of claims between the United States and\r\nPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two\r\ncountries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove\r\nmisunderstanding, and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain.\r\n\r\nOur relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Haiti.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of\r\nthese republics, and on the other hand, their sympathies with the United\r\nStates are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in\r\n1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile.\r\n\r\nCivil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without\r\nprospect of an early close.\r\n\r\nOfficial correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives\r\nus a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic. It\r\nmay be expected to derive new vigor from American influence improved by\r\nthe rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nI solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat, at moderate\r\ncost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments. Such a vessel\r\nis needed for the safety of that state against the native African races,\r\nand in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African\r\nslave-trade than a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least\r\norganized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic,\r\nand the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win\r\nforbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of\r\nBering Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the\r\nlast session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances,\r\nby an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and\r\nsupport as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and\r\nRussia. Assurances have been received from most of the South American\r\nStates of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness\r\nto co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling\r\ncommunication. I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a\r\ntelegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and\r\nGreat Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its early\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will\r\nbe able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of\r\ncommerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nOur very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last.\r\nAn unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of\r\nthe office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension\r\nof intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the\r\nsuccessor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our\r\nrelations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been\r\nsuppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this Government and of\r\nthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consular establishment\r\nthere has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative\r\nrevision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more\r\nintimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and\r\npeople of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting with hearty\r\ngood-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social\r\nintercourse among the Western nations.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its\r\nGovernment, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is\r\ninconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected\r\nby the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary\r\nclaims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland\r\nsea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that\r\nthese proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of\r\nJapan toward the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by\r\nproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether\r\nit is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to\r\nthe United States, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to\r\npursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband trade with\r\nother ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at\r\nleast by a lawful and effective blockade.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under\r\nthe law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in\r\nthe United States. If Congress should think that proceedings in such\r\ncases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I\r\nrecommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign\r\nslave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal\r\noccupation in our country.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime\r\npowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges\r\nof a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute,\r\nas they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports\r\nand harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more\r\nsuccessful during the last year than they were before that time in their\r\nefforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign\r\nwars. The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime\r\nstates to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can\r\nnot be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless, unforeseen political\r\ndifficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on\r\nthe northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are\r\nlikely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a\r\njust and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as\r\nof the nations concerned and their governments.\r\n\r\nCommissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain\r\non the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound\r\nAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution\r\nof the trust assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent\r\nto the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations\r\ncommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it\r\nhas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\r\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement\r\nwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty\r\nto increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that\r\nproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come\r\ninto consideration in connection with the question of continuing or\r\nmodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as\r\nwell as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by\r\nthe reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the\r\ncolonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust\r\nor unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is\r\nevery reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government,\r\nthey will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration\r\nhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need\r\namendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the\r\npractice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\r\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of\r\navocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this\r\ngreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and\r\nought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective\r\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal\r\nreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the\r\nravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.\r\nAll that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present\r\nfullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make it\r\nmanifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military\r\nservice upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our\r\ncountry. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully\r\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last session of\r\nCongress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient\r\ntime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the\r\nprovisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants\r\nsigned by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance\r\nin the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,196,007.62, and\r\nthe aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.89,\r\nleaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of\r\n$96,739,905.73.\r\n\r\nDeduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt\r\nredeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the\r\nactual cash operations of the Treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646.57;\r\ndisbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the\r\nTreasury of $18,842,558.71.\r\n\r\nOf the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from\r\nlands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue\r\n$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from loans\r\napplied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929.13.\r\n\r\nThere were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions\r\nand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for\r\nthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt\r\n$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a\r\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.\r\n\r\nFor the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in\r\ndetail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I\r\nconcur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to\r\nmeet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should\r\nbe still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this\r\nsubject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be\r\nrequired to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books\r\nof the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war\r\ncontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from\r\n$500,000,000. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has\r\nbecome a substantial branch of national, though private, property. For\r\nobvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among\r\nall the people the better. To favor such general distribution, greater\r\ninducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without\r\ninjury be presented to persons of limited means. With this view I suggest\r\nwhether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to\r\nprovide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities\r\nmight be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from\r\nseizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be\r\nnecessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This\r\nwould enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a\r\npossible day of want.\r\n\r\nPrivileges like these would render the possession of such securities to\r\nthe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might\r\nbe able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of citizens\r\nbeing creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is\r\nobvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a\r\ndebt which they owe to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding\r\nthe estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that\r\nofficer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the\r\nbeginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a\r\nsatisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists\r\nand to the people. On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and\r\neighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of\r\nwhich were conversions from State banks. Changes from State systems to the\r\nnational system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon\r\nthere will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by\r\nCongress and no bank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That\r\nthe Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change\r\nin the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The\r\nnational system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support\r\nof the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of\r\npaper money. Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the\r\nsuppression of State-bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine.\r\nIt seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted\r\nunless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note\r\ncirculation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will\r\ndetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the\r\nlast annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative\r\nbureaus of the War Department during the last year. It will also specify\r\nthe measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and\r\nsupply the requisite military force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval\r\nservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our\r\ncountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so\r\nbrief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nThe general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on\r\nthe first of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4610\r\nguns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over\r\nand above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns,\r\nand 42,427 tons.\r\n\r\nThe total number of men at this time in the naval service, including\r\nofficers, is about 51,000.\r\n\r\nThere have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and the\r\nwhole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379, of\r\nwhich 267 are steamers.\r\n\r\nThe gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus\r\nfar reported amount to $14,369,250.51. A large amount of such proceeds is\r\nstill under adjudication and yet to be reported.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,\r\nincluding the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into\r\nexistence from the fourth of March, 1861, to the first of November, 1864,\r\nis $238,647,262.35.\r\n\r\nYour favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and\r\nsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and\r\nthe machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in\r\nmy last annual message.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in\r\nrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to\r\nprize on our inland waters.\r\n\r\nI cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service.\r\n\r\nYour attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for\r\na detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to\r\n$12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of\r\nexpenditures over receipts being $206,532.42.\r\n\r\nThe views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special\r\ngrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of\r\nocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of\r\nincreased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries\r\nshould receive the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,\r\nimprovement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied\r\nportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or\r\ndestroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to\r\nhave absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed\r\nin conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly\r\nestablished in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable\r\nwaste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the\r\ncoast of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity\r\nand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and\r\nthe interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,\r\nhave been only partially organized; but it is understood that these\r\ndifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments,\r\nlike those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation.\r\n\r\nAs intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the\r\nnation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and\r\nimportant recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs,\r\nthe Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted, and which\r\nreport also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics\r\nof public interest pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending\r\non the thirtieth of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614\r\nacres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located\r\nwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for\r\nrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location\r\nfees was $1,019,446.\r\n\r\nThe income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was\r\n$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year. The\r\naggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the\r\nquantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000\r\nacres of surveyed land.\r\n\r\nThe great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by\r\nrailways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives\r\nassurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the\r\nprevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line\r\nof the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward\r\nfrom the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location\r\nof the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento\r\neastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\r\n\r\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added\r\nto the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra\r\nNevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with\r\nenterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the\r\nproduce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year\r\nreached, if not exceeded, $100,000,000 in value.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be\r\nremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation,\r\ndid provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is believed\r\nthat under the present organization the management of the Indians there\r\nwill be attended with reasonable success. Much yet remains to be done to\r\nprovide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the\r\ncountry, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for\r\nthe welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations,\r\nand to them the attention of Congress is invited.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and\r\ndependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease\r\ncontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been\r\ndiligently administered. There have been added to the pension rolls during\r\nthe year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770 invalid\r\nsoldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army\r\ninvalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712.\r\n\r\nOf widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army\r\npension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army\r\npensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the\r\nbeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1430.\r\nOnly twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died.\r\nThe remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because\r\nof relationship to Revolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the\r\nthirtieth of June, 1864, $4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent\r\ninstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been\r\nestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for\r\ninformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,\r\nthe Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present\r\nenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and\r\nvital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly the people's\r\ndepartment, in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other.\r\nI commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe war continues. Since the last annual message all the important lines\r\nand positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our\r\narms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in rear, so\r\nthat Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have again\r\nproduced reasonably fair crops.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is\r\nGeneral Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through\r\nthe insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative\r\nstrength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and\r\nhold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a\r\nwell-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not\r\nyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.\r\n\r\nImportant movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of\r\nmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete\r\nsuccess, it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens\r\nin each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\r\nmaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction more\r\nextensive though less definite in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee,\r\nshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete\r\nsuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future. The\r\ngenius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit\r\nbeing driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution\r\nabolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate,\r\nbut failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the\r\nsame members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those\r\nwho stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and\r\npassage of the measure at the present session. Of course the abstract\r\nquestion is not changed; but an intervening election shows almost\r\ncertainly that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not.\r\nHence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment\r\nwill go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go at all\r\nevents, may we not agree that the sooner the better? It is not claimed\r\nthat the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or\r\ntheir votes any further than, as an additional element to be considered,\r\ntheir judgment may be affected by it. It is the voice of the people now\r\nfor the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis\r\nlike ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very\r\ndesirable, almost indispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is\r\nattainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority\r\nsimply because it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end\r\nis the maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end\r\nsuch will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such\r\nConstitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived\r\nthrough our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its\r\nresult, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than\r\nnow. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions\r\nof voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this.\r\nNot only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great\r\nmajority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and\r\nto be actuated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to\r\nthis effect that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has\r\nventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union.\r\nThere have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as\r\nto the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause, but on\r\nthe distinct issue of Union or no Union the politicians have shown their\r\ninstinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In\r\naffording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to\r\nthe world this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of\r\nvast value to the national cause.\r\n\r\nThe election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known--the\r\nfact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of\r\nnational resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect\r\nthat the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many\r\nhearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving,\r\nthe fallen have been so few. While corps and divisions and brigades and\r\nregiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a\r\ngreat majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is\r\ntrue of the naval service. The election returns prove this. So many voters\r\ncould not else be found. The States regularly holding elections, both now\r\nand four years ago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast\r\n3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate now\r\nof 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the new States of\r\nKansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus swelling the\r\naggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the three years and a\r\nhalf of war to 145,551. A table is appended showing particulars. To\r\nthis again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\nCalifornia, who by the laws of those States could not vote away from their\r\nhomes, and which number can not be less than 90,000. Nor yet is this all.\r\nThe number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years\r\nago--while thousands, white and black, join us as the national arms press\r\nback the insurgent lines. So much is shown, affirmatively and negatively,\r\nby the election. It is not material to inquire how the increase has been\r\nproduced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war, which\r\nis probably true. The important fact remains demonstrated that we have\r\nmore men now than we had when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor\r\nin process of exhaustion; that we are gaining strength and may if need be\r\nmaintain the contest indefinitely. [This sentence recognizes the concern\r\nof a guerilla war after the main war finished.]This as to men. Material\r\nresources are now more complete and abundant than ever.\r\n\r\nThe national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,\r\ninexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the\r\nnational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable.\r\nThe manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful\r\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no\r\nattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good.\r\nHe would accept nothing short of severance of the Union, precisely what\r\nwe will not and can not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit\r\nand oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no\r\nexcuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily reaccept the Union;\r\nwe can not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct,\r\nsimple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and\r\ndecided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people\r\nfail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the victory and defeat\r\nfollowing war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause\r\nis not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept\r\nthe Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and\r\nreunion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have\r\npeace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national\r\nauthority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not,\r\nif it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain\r\nor allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the\r\npeaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating\r\nonly in Constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other\r\npossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust;\r\nas, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and whatever\r\nmight require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself\r\nwould be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons\r\nand remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive\r\ncontrol. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be\r\nfairly judged of by the past.\r\n\r\nA year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered\r\nto all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made\r\nknown that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of\r\nspecial clemency. During the year many availed themselves of the general\r\nprovision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some\r\nled to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less\r\neasy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have\r\nbeen granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary\r\napplication has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full\r\nyear open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice;\r\nthat is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open\r\nto all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall\r\ndemand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than\r\nheretofore shall be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national\r\nauthority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable\r\ncondition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract\r\nnothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a\r\nyear ago, that \"while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt\r\nto retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to\r\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any\r\nof the acts of Congress.\" If the people should, by whatever mode or means,\r\nmake it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I,\r\nmust be their instrument to perform it.\r\n\r\nIn stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war\r\nwill cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on\r\nthe part of those who began it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, DECEMBER 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I believe I shall never be old enough to\r\nspeak without embarrassment when I have nothing to talk about. I have no\r\ngood news to tell you, and yet I have no bad news to tell. We have talked\r\nof elections until there is nothing more to say about them. The most\r\ninteresting news now we have is from Sherman. We all know where he went\r\nin at, but I can't tell where he will come out at. I will now close by\r\nproposing three cheers for General Sherman and his army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR HALL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HALL, Jefferson City, Mo.:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me of the doings of a man at Hannibal, Mo., by the\r\nname of Haywood, who, as I am told, has charge of some militia force, and\r\nis not in the United States service. Please inquire into the matter and\r\ncorrect anything you may find amiss if in your power.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Smith and the Hon. Henry\r\nStanbery be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners to\r\ninvestigate and report, for the information of the President; upon the\r\ncivil and military administration in the military division bordering upon\r\nand west of the Mississippi, under such instructions as shall be issued by\r\nauthority of the President and the War Department.\r\n\r\nSecond, said commissioners shall have power to examine witnesses\r\nupon oath, and to take such proofs orally or in writing, upon the\r\nsubject-matters of investigation as they may deem expedient, and return\r\nthe same together with their report.\r\n\r\nThird, all officers and persons in the military, naval and revenue\r\nservices, or in any branch of the public service under the authority\r\nof the United States Government, are required, upon subpoena issued by\r\ndirection of the said commissioners, to appear before them at such time\r\nand place as may be designated in said subpoena and to give testimony on\r\noath touching such matters as may be inquired of by the commissioners,\r\nand to produce such books, papers, writings, and documents as they may\r\nbe notified or required to produce by the commissioners, and as may be in\r\ntheir possession.\r\n\r\nFourth, said special commissioners shall also investigate and report upon\r\nany other matters that may hereafter be directed by the Secretary of War,\r\nand shall with all convenient dispatch make report to him in writing of\r\ntheir investigation, and shall also from time to time make special reports\r\nto the Secretary of War upon such matters as they may deem of importance\r\nto the public interests.\r\n\r\nFifth, the Secretary of War shall assign to the said commissioners such\r\naid and assistance as may be required for the performance of their duties,\r\nand make such just and reasonable allowances and compensation for the said\r\ncommissioners and for the persons employed by them as he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WASHINGTON, D.C., December 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nPlease accept for yourself, officers, and men, the nation's thanks for\r\nyour good work of yesterday. You made a magnificent beginning; a grand\r\nconsummation is within your easy reach. Do not let it slip.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE \"GREENBACK\" CURRENCY\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL B. D. TAYLOR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December [16?], 1864.\r\n\r\nDEAR COLONEL DICK:--I have long determined to make public the origin of\r\nthe greenback and tell the world that it is Dick Taylor's creation. You\r\nhad always been friendly to me, and when troublous times fell on us, and\r\nmy shoulders, though broad and willing, were weak, and myself surrounded\r\nby such circumstances and such people that I knew not whom to trust, then\r\nI said in my extremity: \"I will send for Colonel Taylor; he will know what\r\nto do.\" I think it was in January, 1862, on or about the 16th, that I did\r\nso. You came, and I said to you:\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\" Said you, \"Why, issue Treasury notes bearing no\r\ninterest, printed on the best banking paper. Issue enough to pay off the\r\nArmy expenses and declare it legal tender.\"\r\n\r\nChase thought it a hazardous thing, but we finally accomplished it,\r\nand gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever\r\nhad--their own paper to pay their own debts.\r\n\r\nIt is due to you, the father of the present greenback, that the people\r\nshould know it, and I take great pleasure in making it known. How many\r\ntimes have I laughed at you telling me plainly that I was too lazy to be\r\nanything but a lawyer.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA.

SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 26, 1864\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL SHERMAN:--Many, many thanks for your Christmas gift, the\r\ncapture of Savannah.\r\n\r\nWhen you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was\r\nanxious, if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and\r\nremembering that \"nothing risked, nothing gained,\" I did not interfere.\r\nNow, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I\r\nbelieve none of us went further than to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nAnd taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be\r\ntaken, it is indeed a great success. Not only does it afford the obvious\r\nand immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world that your\r\narmy could be divided, putting the stronger part to an important new\r\nservice, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the\r\nwhole,--Hood's army,--it brings those who sat in darkness to see a great\r\nlight. But what next?\r\n\r\nI suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to decide.\r\n\r\nPlease make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER IN COMMAND AT LEXINGTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nOFFICER IN COMMAND at Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nIf within your power send me the particulars of the causes for which\r\nLieutenant-Governor Jacob was arrested and sent away.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Among the most gratifying proofs\r\nof this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our\r\nschools and colleges to the national cause.\r\n\r\nI am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduct to the preservation\r\nof those institutions, under which alone we can expect good government and\r\nin its train sound learning, and the progress of the liberal arts.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a \"joint\r\nresolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue\r\nact,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nMy reason for so doing is that I am informed that this joint resolution\r\nwas prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress for\r\nthe purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal\r\nrevenue act, which were discovered on an examination of an official\r\ncopy procured from the State Department a few hours only before the\r\nadjournment. It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was\r\ntaken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President\r\nof the Senate for his signature.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a\r\nkind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct,\r\nhave been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to\r\ninclude all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed,\r\nbeen already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nRichard T.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I transmit to Congress a\r\ncopy of two treaties between the United States and Belgium, for the\r\nextinguishment of the Scheldt dues, etc., concluded on the twentieth of\r\nMay, 1863, and twentieth of July, 1863, respectively, the ratifications of\r\nwhich were exchanged at Brussels on the twenty-fourth of June last; and\r\nI recommend an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions thereof\r\nrelative to the payment of the proportion of the United States toward the\r\ncapitalization of the said dues.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated at\r\nHarvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends. I do not wish\r\nto put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which those\r\nwho have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to\r\nhold. Could he, without embarrassment to you, or detriment to the service,\r\ngo into your military family with some nominal rank, I, and not the\r\npublic, furnishing his necessary means? If no, say so without the least\r\nhesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested that you\r\nshall not be encumbered as you can be yourself.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the Cabinet, with myself, considered the question,\r\nto-day, as to the time of your coming on here. While we fully appreciate\r\nyour wish to remain in Tennessee until her State government shall be\r\ncompletely reinaugurated, it is our unanimous conclusion that it is unsafe\r\nfor you to not be here on the 4th of March. Be sure to reach here by that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

You will, of course, expect that I\r\nacknowledge it. So much has been said about Gettysburg and so well, that\r\nfor me to attempt to say more may perhaps only serve to weaken the force\r\nof that which has already been said. A most graceful and eloquent tribute\r\nwas paid to the patriotism and self-denying labors of the American\r\nladies, on the occasion of the consecration of the National Cemetery at\r\nGettysburg, by our illustrious friend, Edward Everett, now, alas! departed\r\nfrom earth. His life was a truly great one, and I think the greatest part\r\nof it was that which crowned its closing years, I wish you to read, if you\r\nhave not already done so, the eloquent and truthful words which he then\r\nspoke of the women of America. Truly, the services they have rendered to\r\nthe defenders of our country in this perilous time, and are yet rendering,\r\ncan never be estimated as they ought to be. For your kind wishes to me\r\npersonally, I beg leave to render you likewise my sincerest thanks. I\r\nassure you they are reciprocated. And now, gentlemen and ladies, may God\r\nbless you all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point\r\n\r\nIf Newell W.

Note on the\r\ncopy which you retain the time of delivery and to whom delivered. Receive\r\ntheir answer in writing, waiting a reasonable time for it, and which, if\r\nit contain their decision to come through without further condition, will\r\nbe your warrant to ask General Ord to pass them through as directed in the\r\nletter of the Secretary of War to him.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, there to meet and\r\ninformally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, on the\r\nbasis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy\r\nof which you have. You will make known to them that three things are\r\nindispensable to wit:\r\n\r\n1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.\r\n\r\n2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery\r\nquestion from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to\r\nCongress, and in preceding documents.\r\n\r\n3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the\r\ndisbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\r\n\r\nYou will inform them that all propositions of theirs, not inconsistent\r\nwith the above, will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere\r\nliberality. You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me.\r\nYou will not assume to definitely consummate anything.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE ABOLISHING OF SLAVERY\r\n\r\nPASSAGE THROUGH CONGRESS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE\r\nABOLISHING OF SLAVERY\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, JANUARY 31, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe supposed the passage through Congress of the Constitutional amendment\r\nfor the abolishing of slavery throughout the United States was the\r\noccasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was one of congratulation to the country, and to the whole\r\nworld. But there is a task yet before us--to go forward and consummate by\r\nthe votes of the States that which Congress so nobly began yesterday. He\r\nhad the honor to inform those present that Illinois had already done the\r\nwork. Maryland was about half through, but he felt proud that Illinois was\r\na little ahead.\r\n\r\nHe thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct\r\nto the winding up of the great difficulty. He wished the reunion of\r\nall the States perfected, and so effected as to remove all causes of\r\ndisturbance in the future; and, to attain this end, it was necessary\r\nthat the original disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out. He\r\nthought all would bear him witness that he had never shirked from doing\r\nall that he could to eradicate slavery, by issuing an Emancipation\r\nProclamation. But that proclamation falls short of what the amendment\r\nwill be when fully consummated. A question might be raised whether the\r\nproclamation was legally valid. It might be added, that it only aided\r\nthose who came into our lines, and that it was inoperative as to those\r\nwho did not give themselves up; or that it would have no effect upon the\r\nchildren of the slaves born hereafter; in fact, it would be urged that it\r\ndid not meet the evil. But this amendment is a king's cure for all evils.\r\nIt winds the whole thing up. He would repeat, that it was the fitting if\r\nnot the indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are\r\nplaying. He could not but congratulate all present--himself, the country,\r\nand the whole world upon this great moral victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, February 1, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point:\r\n\r\nLet nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your military\r\nmovements or plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN THE DRAFT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February 6, 1865\r\n\r\nWhereas complaints are made in some localities respecting the assignments\r\nof quotas and credits allowed for the pending call of troops to fill\r\nup the armies: Now, in order to determine all controversies in respect\r\nthereto, and to avoid any delay in filling up the armies, it is ordered,\r\n\r\n1. That the Attorney-General, Brigadier-General Richard Delafield, and\r\nColonel C. W. Foster, be, and they are hereby constituted, a board to\r\nexamine into the proper quotas and credits of the respective States and\r\ndistricts under the call of December 19, 1864, with directions, if any\r\nerrors be found therein, to make such corrections as the law and facts may\r\nrequire, and report their determination to the Provost-Marshal-General.\r\nThe determination of said board to be final and conclusive, and the draft\r\nto be made in conformity therewith.\r\n\r\n2. The Provost-Marshal-General is ordered to make the draft in the\r\nrespective districts as speedily as the same can be done after the\r\nfifteenth of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nPROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL:\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen distinctly say to me this morning that what they want is\r\nthe means from your office of showing their people that the quota assigned\r\nto them is right. They think it will take but little time--two hours, they\r\nsay. Please give there double the time and every facility you can.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Provost-Marshal brings this letter back to me and says he cannot give\r\nthe facility required without detriment to the service, and thereupon he\r\nis excused from doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN, Commanding Post at Henderson, Ky.:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military\r\nservice, and even torturing them--riding them on rails and the like to\r\nextort their consent. I hope this may be a mistake. The like must not be\r\ndone by you, or any one under you. You must not force negroes any more\r\nthan white men. Answer me on this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SMITH.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH, of Vermont:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the assignment of her quota for\r\nthe draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in\r\nbad faith of the Government's promise to fairly allow credits for men\r\npreviously furnished. To illustrate, a supposed case is stated as follows:\r\n\r\nVermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on\r\nthe pending call; and being equal, each must furnish as many as the other\r\nin the long run. But the Government finds that on former calls Vermont\r\nfurnished a surplus of five hundred, and New Hampshire a surplus, of\r\nfifteen hundred. These two surpluses making two thousand and added to the\r\nsix thousand, making eight thousand to be furnished by the two States, or\r\nfour thousand each less, by fair credits. Then subtract Vermont's surplus\r\nof five hundred from her four thousand, leaves three thousand five hundred\r\nas her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's\r\nsurplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves two thousand\r\nfive hundred as her quota on the pending call. These three thousand five\r\nhundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand, which\r\nthe supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just equal for\r\nVermont to furnish one thousand more now than New Hampshire, because New\r\nHampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which\r\nequalizes the burdens of the two in the long run. And this result, so far\r\nfrom being bad faith to Vermont, is indispensable to keeping good faith\r\nwith New Hampshire. By no other result can the six thousand men be\r\nobtained from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and\r\nkeep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the\r\nprocess by which the right result is reached. The supposed case is perfect\r\nas an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair\r\ncredits, but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair\r\ncredits have been deducted, and it is impossible to concede what Vermont\r\nasks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or making\r\nother localities pay for the partiality shown her.\r\n\r\nThis upon the case stated. If there be different reasons for making an\r\nallowance to Vermont, let them be presented and considered.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution entitled \"Joint resolution declaring certain States\r\nnot entitled to representation in the electoral college\" has been signed\r\nby the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied in its\r\npassage and presentation to him. In his own view, however, the two Houses\r\nof Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution, have\r\ncomplete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by\r\nthem to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or\r\nobstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at\r\nall essential in the matter. He disclaims all right of the Executive to\r\ninterfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral\r\nvotes, and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has\r\nexpressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of\r\nhis own upon the subject of the resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February\r\n8, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point. Va.:\r\n\r\nI am called on by the House of Representatives to give an account of my\r\ninterview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and it is very\r\ndesirable to me to put your despatch of February 1, to the Secretary of\r\nWar, in which, among other things, you say: \"I fear now their going\r\nback without any expression from any one in authority will have a bad\r\ninfluence.\" I think the despatch does you credit, while I do not see that\r\nit can embarrass you. May I use it?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF THE ELECTORAL COUNT\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS, REPORTING THE RESULT OF THE ELECTORAL\r\nCOUNT,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nWith deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their confidence;\r\nwith a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty required under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances, and now rendered doubly difficult by\r\nexisting national perils; yet with a firm reliance on the strength of\r\nour free government, and the eventual loyalty of the people to the just\r\nprinciples upon which it is founded, and above all with an unshaken\r\nfaith in the Supreme Ruler of nations, I accept this trust. Be pleased to\r\nsignify this to the respective Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGIC REVIEW OF PEACE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn response to your resolution of the eighth instant, requesting\r\ninformation in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads,\r\nI have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P.\r\nBlair, Sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nDecember 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nAllow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat at the time I was informed that Mr. Blair sought the card as a means\r\nof getting to Richmond, Va., but he was given no authority to speak or act\r\nfor the Government, nor was I informed of anything he would say or do on\r\nhis own account or otherwise. Afterwards Mr. Blair told me that he had\r\nbeen to Richmond and had seen Mr. Jefferson Davis; and he (Mr. B.) at the\r\nsame time left with me a manuscript letter, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VA., January 12, 1865. F. P. BLAIR, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to give you\r\nin this for in the substance of remarks made by me, to be repeated by you\r\nto President Lincoln, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI have no disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing, now as\r\nheretofore, to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace, and\r\nam ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose it will be\r\nreceived, or to receive a commission if the United States Government\r\nshall choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection of our former\r\noffers, I would, if you could promise that a commissioner, minister, or\r\nother agent would be received, appoint one immediately, and renew the\r\neffort to enter into conference with a view to secure peace to the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nYours, etc., JEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to Mr. Davis, I\r\nwrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nP. P. BLAIR, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth\r\ninstant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and\r\nshall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential\r\nperson now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with\r\nthe view of securing peace to the people of our one common country.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on\r\nthe back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which entry\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nJanuary 28, 1865\r\n\r\nTo-day Mr. Blair tells me that on the twenty-first instant he delivered\r\nto Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with\r\nhim; that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr.\r\nBlair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the\r\npart about \"our one common country\" related to the part of Mr. Davis'\r\nletter about \"the two countries,\" to which Mr. Davis replied that he so\r\nunderstood it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Secretary of War placed in my hands the following telegram,\r\nindorsed by him, as appears:\r\n\r\nOFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH WAR DEPARTMENT. The following\r\ntelegram received at Washington January 29, 1865, from headquarters Army\r\nof James,\r\n\r\n6.30 P.M., January 29, 1865:\r\n\r\n\"HON. EDWIN M.

(Sent at 2\r\nA.M., 30th.) MAJOR-GENERAL ORD.\r\n\r\nSIR:--This Department has no knowledge of any understanding by General\r\nGrant to allow any person to come within his lines as commissioner of any\r\nsort.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, by my direction, the Secretary of War telegraphed General Ord\r\nas follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., January 30. 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL E.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards I prepared and put into the hands of Major Thomas T. Eckert the\r\nfollowing instructions and message:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nMAJOR T. T.

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1865\r\n\r\nSIR:--You will proceed with the documents placed in your hands, and on\r\nreaching General Ord will deliver him the letter addressed to him by the\r\nSecretary of War; then, by General Ord's assistance, procure an interview\r\nwith Messrs.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA.. February 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL AND R. M. T.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the following dispatch\r\nwas received from General Grant:\r\n\r\nOFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe following telegram received at Washington January 30, 1865, from City\r\nPoint, Va., 10.30 A.M., January 30, 1865:\r\n\r\n  \"His EXCELLENCY\r\n  A.

U.S. GRANT,\r\nLieutenant-General, Commanding Armies United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, it will be perceived, transferred General Ord's agency in the matter\r\nto General Grant. I resolved, however, to send Major Eckert forward with\r\nhis message, and accordingly telegraphed General Grant as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, January 13, 1865 (Sent at 1.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nA messenger is coming to you on the business contained in your despatch.\r\nDetain the gentlemen in comfortable quarters until he arrives, and then\r\nact upon the message he brings as far as applicable, it having been\r\nmade up to pass through General Ord's hands, and when the gentlemen were\r\nsupposed to be beyond our lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State:\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally\r\nconfer with Messrs.

I notified them that they could not proceed further unless\r\nthey complied with the terms expressed in my letter. The point of meeting\r\ndesignated in the above note would not, in my opinion, be insisted\r\nupon. Think Fort Monroe would be acceptable. Having complied with my\r\ninstructions, I will return to Washington to-morrow unless otherwise\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nTHOS. T.

EDWIN M.

Stephens and Hunter that their\r\nintentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union.\r\nI have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my own or to\r\naccount for my reticency. This has placed me in an awkward position, which\r\nI could have avoided by not seeing them in the first instance. I fear now\r\ntheir going back without any expression from anyone in authority will have\r\na bad influence. At the same time, I recognize the difficulties in the way\r\nof receiving these informal commissioners at this time, and do not know\r\nwhat to recommend. I am sorry, however, that Mr. Lincoln can not have an\r\ninterview with the two named in this despatch, if not all three now within\r\nour lines. Their letter to me was all that the President's instructions\r\ncontemplated to secure their safe conduct if they had used the same\r\nlanguage to Major Eckert.\r\n\r\n\"U.S. GRANT \"Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis despatch of General Grant changed my purpose, and accordingly I\r\ntelegraphed him and the Secretary of State, respectively, as follows:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Stanton, Secretary of War, Washington.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton Roads, found the Secretary of\r\nState and Major Eckert on a steamer anchored offshore, and learned of\r\nthem that the Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also anchored\r\noffshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of State had not yet seen\r\nor communicated with them. I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally\r\ncomplied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer of\r\nthe Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to me of the 1st he\r\ncharacterizes as \"not satisfactory.\" That answer is as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT, Major and\r\nAid-de-Camp. MAJOR:-Your note, delivered by yourself this day, has been\r\nconsidered. In reply we have to say that we were furnished with a copy of\r\nthe letter of President Lincoln to Francis P.

Blair of the 18th of January ultimo, or upon any other terms\r\nor conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the\r\nessential principles of self-government and popular rights, upon which our\r\ninstitutions are founded.\r\n\r\nIt is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free interchange of ideas and\r\ninformation, upon what principles and terms, if any, a just and honorable\r\npeace can be established without the further effusion of blood, and to\r\ncontribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result.\r\n\r\nWe think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to\r\nbe understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this\r\ninformal conference the views and feelings above expressed.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL, R. M. T. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.-The above communication was delivered to me at Fort Monroe at 4.30\r\nP.M. February 2 by Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock, of General Grant's staff.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS T. ECKERT Major and Aid-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,\r\nand Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the\r\nSecretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No question\r\nof preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no\r\nother person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it\r\nwas in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and\r\nverbal merely. On our part the whole substance of the instructions to the\r\nSecretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon, and\r\nnothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other party it was\r\nnot said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent\r\nto reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would\r\nconsent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the\r\nadoption of some other course first, which, as some of them seemed to\r\nargue, might or might not lead to reunion, but which course we thought\r\nwould amount to an indefinite postponement. The conference ended without\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought is\r\nrespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE. WASHINGTON, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the eighth instant,\r\nrequesting information concerning recent conversations or communications\r\nwith insurgents, under executive sanction, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, to whom was referred a resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 8th instant, requesting \"the President of the United States, if, in\r\nhis opinion, not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish to the\r\nSenate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations\r\nor communications with certain rebels, said to have taken place under\r\nexecutive sanction, including communications with the rebel Jefferson\r\nDavis, and any correspondence relating thereto,\" has the honor to report\r\nthat the Senate may properly be referred to a special message of the\r\nPresident bearing upon the subject of the resolution, and transmitted to\r\nthe House this day. Appended to this report is a copy of an instruction\r\nwhich has been addressed to Charles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London,\r\nand which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the\r\nsubject referred to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February 10, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SEWARD TO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n(Extract.) No. 1258.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February 7,1865\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3d, the President, attended by the Secretary,\r\nreceived Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on board the United\r\nStates steam transport River Queen in Hampton Roads. The conference was\r\naltogether informal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or\r\nother witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although\r\nearnest and free, was calm, and courteous, and kind on both sides. The\r\nRichmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time\r\ndid they either make categorical demands, or tender formal stipulations or\r\nabsolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted\r\nfour hours, the several points at issue between the Government and the\r\ninsurgents were distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and\r\nin an amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor\r\nwas a postponement of the question of separation, upon which the war is\r\nwaged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well as\r\nthose of the insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season\r\nduring which passions might be expected to subside, and the armies be\r\nreduced, and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections\r\nresumed. It was suggested by them that through such postponement we\r\nmight now have immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of\r\nan ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this\r\nGovernment and the States, section, or people now engaged in conflict with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, though deliberately considered, was nevertheless regarded\r\nby the President as one of armistice or truce, and he announced that we\r\ncan agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the\r\nbasis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces, and the restoration\r\nof the national authority throughout all the States in the Union.\r\nCollaterally, and in subordination to the proposition which was thus\r\nannounced, the antislavery policy of the United States was reviewed in all\r\nits bearings, and the President announced that he must not be expected to\r\ndepart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation\r\nof emancipation and other documents, as these positions were reiterated in\r\nhis last annual message. It was further declared by the President that\r\nthe complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable\r\ncondition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be\r\nproposed. The President assured the other party that, while he must adhere\r\nto these positions, he would be prepared, so far as power is lodged with\r\nthe Executive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is limited by\r\nthe Constitution; and when peace should be made, Congress must necessarily\r\nact in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of\r\nrepresentatives from the insurrectionary States. The Richmond party\r\nwere then informed that Congress had, on the 31st ultimo, adopted by\r\na constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several\r\nStates the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that\r\nthere is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three\r\nfourths of the States, so as to become a part of the national organic law.\r\n\r\nThe conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence, without producing\r\nan agreement of views upon the several matters discussed, or any of them.\r\nNevertheless, it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to\r\nsubmit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents, and to\r\nhear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nREAR-ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER, Commanding North Atlantic Squadron, Hampton\r\nRoads, Va.\r\n\r\nSIR:--It is made my agreeable duty to enclose herewith the joint\r\nresolution approved 24th January, 1865, tendering the thanks of Congress\r\nto yourself, the officers and men under your command for their gallantry\r\nand good conduct in the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who\r\nparticipated in that brilliant and decisive victory under your command.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 12, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nI understand that provost-marshals in different parts of Missouri are\r\nassuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and\r\ntherefore are seizing and selling property to pay damages. This, if true,\r\nis both outrageous and ridiculous. Do not allow it. The courts, and\r\nnot provost-marshals, are to decide such questions unless when military\r\nnecessity makes an exception. Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and\r\nWesley Martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East if\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING OFFICERS IN WEST TENNESSEE\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE MILITARY OFFICERS COMMANDING IN WEST TENNESSEE:\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot order as within requested, allow me to say that it is my\r\nwish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments, and\r\noppressions, so far as is possible consistently with your military\r\nnecessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain\r\nthe blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and not\r\nhinder, every advance in that direction.\r\n\r\nOf your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do so\r\nin the spirit and with the purpose above indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday about provost-marshal system received. As part of\r\nthe same subject, let me say I am now pressed in regard to a pending\r\nassessment in St. Louis County. Please examine and satisfy yourself\r\nwhether this assessment should proceed or be abandoned; and if you\r\ndecide that it is to proceed, please examine as to the propriety of its\r\napplication to a gentleman by the name of Charles McLaran.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON February 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nPlease ascertain whether General Fisk's administration is as good as it\r\nmight be, and answer me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONVENING THE SENATE IN EXTRA SESSION,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at twelve o'clock on the fourth of March next to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part\r\nof the Executive;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have\r\nconsidered it to be my duty to issue this, my proclamation, declaring\r\nthat an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States\r\nto convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of\r\nWashington, on the fourth day of March next, at twelve o'clock at noon\r\non that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at\r\nWashington...............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. By the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER IN COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 17, 1865\r\n\r\nOFFICER IN COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY:\r\n\r\nChaplain Fitzgibbon yesterday sent me a despatch invoking Clemency for\r\nJackson, Stewart, and Randall, who are to be shot to-day. The despatch is\r\nso vague that there is no means here of ascertaining whether or not the\r\nexecution of sentence of one or more of them may not already have been\r\nordered. If not suspend execution of sentence m their cases until further\r\norders and forward records of trials for examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nMAJOR ECKERT: Please send above telegram JNO. G. NICOLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 24, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nI am in a little perplexity. I was induced to authorize a gentleman to\r\nbring Roger A. Pryor here with a view of effecting an exchange of him;\r\nbut since then I have seen a despatch of yours showing that you specially\r\nobject to his exchange. Meantime he has reached here and reported to\r\nme. It is an ungracious thing for me to send him back to prison, and yet\r\ninadmissible for him to remain here long. Cannot you help me out with it?\r\nI can conceive that there may be difference to you in days, and I can keep\r\nhim a few days to accommodate on that point. I have not heard of my son's\r\nreaching you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 24, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nPlease inquire and report to me whether there is any propriety of longer\r\nkeeping in Gratiott Street Prison a man said to be there by the name of\r\nRiley Whiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, February 25, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan's despatch to you, of to-day, in which he says he \"will\r\nbe off on Monday,\" and that he \"will leave behind about two thousand men,\"\r\ncauses the Secretary of War and myself considerable anxiety. Have you\r\nwell considered whether you do not again leave open the Shenandoah Valley\r\nentrance to Maryland and Pennsylvania, or, at least, to the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., February 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nSubsequent reflection, conference with General Halleck, your despatch, and\r\none from General Sheridan, have relieved my anxiety; and so I beg that you\r\nwill dismiss any concern you may have on my account, in the matter of my\r\nlast despatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. W. CONWAY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS W. CONWAY, General Superintendent Freedmen, Department of the\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your statement to Major-General Hurlbut of the condition of the\r\nfreedmen of your department, and of your success in the work of their\r\nmoral and physical elevation, has reached me and given me much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThat we shall be entirely successful in our efforts I firmly believe.\r\n\r\nThe blessing of God and the efforts of good and faithful men will bring us\r\nan earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the\r\nfreedmen could reasonably expect.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYou have not sent contents of Richmond papers for Tuesday or Wednesday.\r\nDid you not receive them? If not, does it indicate anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 3, 1865. 12 PM.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no\r\nconference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of General\r\nLee's army, or on some minor and purely military matter. He instructs me\r\nto say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer upon any political\r\nquestion. Such questions the President holds in his own hands, and will\r\nsubmit them to no military conferences or conventions. Meantime you are to\r\npress to the utmost your military advantages.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:--At this second appearing to take the oath of the\r\npresidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course\r\nto be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four\r\nyears, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth\r\non every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the\r\nattention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new\r\ncould be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly\r\ndepends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust,\r\nreasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the\r\nfuture, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought\r\nto avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this\r\nplace, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent\r\nagents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to\r\ndissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties\r\ndeprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation\r\nsurvive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the\r\nwar came.\r\n\r\nOne eighth of the whole population was colored slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These\r\nslaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this\r\ninterest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and\r\nextend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend\r\nthe Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more\r\nthan to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected\r\nfor the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.\r\nNeither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or\r\neven before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier\r\ntriumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the\r\nsame Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the\r\nother. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's\r\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces,\r\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not\r\nbe answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His\r\nown purposes. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs\r\nbe that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If\r\nwe shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which,\r\nin the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\r\nthrough His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to\r\nboth North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom\r\nthe offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine\r\nattributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?\r\nFondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war\r\nmay speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the\r\nwealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited\r\ntoil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash\r\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand\r\nyears ago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true\r\nand righteous altogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right\r\nas God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we\r\nare in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have\r\nborne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may\r\nachieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL JOHN POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 7, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nPlease state briefly, by telegraph, what you concluded about the\r\nassessments in St. Louis County. Early in the war one Samuel B. Churchill\r\nwas sent from St. Louis to Louisville, where I have quite satisfactory\r\nevidence that he has not misbehaved. Still I am told his property at St.\r\nLouis is subjected to the assessment, which I think it ought not to be.\r\nStill I wish to know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va:\r\n\r\nYour two despatches to the Secretary of War, one relating to supplies for\r\nthe enemy going by the Blackwater, and the other to General Singleton and\r\nJudge Hughes, have been laid before me by him. As to Singleton and Hughes,\r\nI think they are not in Richmond by any authority, unless it be from you.\r\nI remember nothing from me which could aid them in getting there, except a\r\nletter to you, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February 7, 1865. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL\r\nGRANT, City Point, Va.: General Singleton, who bears you this, claims that\r\nhe already has arrangements made, if you consent, to bring a large amount\r\nof Southern produce through your lines. For its bearing on our finances,\r\nI would be glad for this to be done, if it can be, without injuriously\r\ndisturbing your military operations, or supplying the enemy. I wish you\r\nto be judge and master on these points. Please see and hear him fully,\r\nand decide whether anything, and, if anything, what, can be done in the\r\npremises. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nI believe I gave Hughes a card putting him with Singleton on the same\r\nletter. However this may be, I now authorize you to get Singleton and\r\nHughes away from Richmond, if you choose, and can. I also authorize you,\r\nby an order, or in what form you choose, to suspend all operations on the\r\nTreasury trade permits, in all places southeastward of the Alleghenies.\r\nIf you make such order, notify me of it, giving a copy, so that I can give\r\ncorresponding direction to the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OFFERING PARDON TO DESERTERS,\r\n\r\nMARCH 11, 1865\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas, the twenty-first section of the act of Congress, approved on the\r\n3d instant, entitled \"An Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed\r\nto provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and for\r\nother purposes,\" requires that in addition to the other lawful penalties\r\nof the crime of desertion from the military or naval service, all persons\r\nwho have deserted the military or naval service of the United States who\r\nshall not return to said service or report themselves to a provost-marshal\r\nwithin sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned, shall\r\nbe deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their\r\ncitizenship and their right to become citizens, and such deserters shall\r\nbe forever incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the\r\nUnited States, or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof; and all\r\npersons who shall hereafter desert the military or naval service, and all\r\npersons who, being duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the\r\ndistrict in which they are enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the United\r\nStates with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service\r\nduly ordered, shall be liable to the penalties of this section; and the\r\nPresident is hereby authorized and required forthwith, on the passage of\r\nthis act, to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this\r\nsection, in which proclamation the President is requested to notify all\r\ndeserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be\r\npardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies, or to\r\nsuch other organizations as they may be assigned to, until they shall have\r\nserved for a period of time equal to their original term of enlistment:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, do issue this my proclamation as required by said act,\r\nordering and requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts; and\r\nI do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall within sixty days\r\nfrom the date of this proclamation, viz., on or before the 10th day of\r\nMay, 1865, return to service or report themselves to a provost-marshal,\r\nshall be pardoned on condition that they return to their regiments or\r\ncompanies or to such other organization as they may be assigned to, and\r\nserve the remainder of their original terms of enlistment, and in addition\r\nthereto a period equal to the time lost by desertion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed...............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. T. BLOW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY T. BLOW, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nA Miss E. Snodgrass, who was banished from Saint Louis in May,1863, wishes\r\nto take the oath and return home. What say you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THURLOW WEED,\r\n\r\nMARCH 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR Mr. WEED:\r\n\r\nEvery one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my little\r\nnotification speech and on the recent inaugural address. I expect the\r\nlatter to wear as well as perhaps better than--anything I have produced;\r\nbut I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not flattered by\r\nbeing shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the\r\nAlmighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to deny that\r\nthere is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I thought needed\r\nto be told, and, as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most\r\ndirectly on myself, I thought others might afford for me to tell it.\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL ROUGH AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nCOL. R. M. ROUGH AND OTHERS, Chicago, Ill.:\r\n\r\nYours received. The best I can do with it is, to refer it to the\r\nWar Department. The Rock Island case referred to, was my individual\r\nenterprise; and it caused so much difficulty in so many ways that I\r\npromised to never undertake another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO AN INDIANA REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It will be but a very few words that I shall undertake\r\nto say. I was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, and lived in Illinois;\r\nand now I am here, where it is my business to care equally for the good\r\npeople of all the States. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on this\r\nday able to present the captured flag to the Governor of Indiana. I am not\r\ndisposed, in saying this, to make a distinction between the States, for\r\nall have done equally well.\r\n\r\nThere are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which I have\r\nnot said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known.\r\nBut there is one--the recent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are\r\nsometimes called, to employ the negro to fight for them. I have neither\r\nwritten nor made a speech on that subject, because that was their\r\nbusiness, not mine, and if I had a wish on the subject, I had not the\r\npower to introduce it, or make it effective. The great question with them\r\nwas whether the negro, being put into the army, will fight for them. I do\r\nnot know, and therefore cannot decide. They ought to know better than me.\r\nI have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be\r\nslaves; but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery, it\r\nwill be a better argument than any I have yet heard. He who will fight for\r\nthat, ought to be a slave. They have concluded, at last, to take one out\r\nof four of the slaves and put them in the army, and that one out of the\r\nfour who will fight to keep the others in slavery, ought to be a slave\r\nhimself, unless he is killed in a fight. While I have often said that all\r\nmen ought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to be slaves\r\nwho want to be, and next to them those white people who argue in favor of\r\nmaking other people slaves. I am in favor of giving an appointment to such\r\nwhite men to try it on for these slaves. I will say one thing in regard\r\nto the negroes being employed to fight for them. I do know he cannot fight\r\nand stay at home and make bread too. And as one is about as important as\r\nthe other to them, I don't care which they do. I am rather in favor of\r\nhaving them try them as soldiers. They lack one vote of doing that, and I\r\nwish I could send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in favor\r\nof allowing the negro to fight. But they cannot fight and work both. We\r\nmust now see the bottom of the enemy's resources. They will stand out as\r\nlong as they can, and if the negro will fight for them they must allow him\r\nto fight. They have drawn upon their last branch of resources, and we can\r\nnow see the bottom. I am glad to see the end so near at hand. I have said\r\nnow more than I intended, and will therefore bid you good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING INDIANS,\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas reliable information has been received that hostile Indians,\r\nwithin the limits of the United States, have been furnished with arms and\r\nmunitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory,\r\nand are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed\r\nand sparse settlements of the frontier;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons\r\ndetected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by\r\ncourt-martial at the nearest military post, and if convicted, shall\r\nreceive the punishment due to their deserts.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed...................\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ANNULLING THE SENTENCE\r\n\r\nAGAINST BENJAMIN G. SMITH AND FRANKLIN W. SMITH,\r\n\r\nMARCH 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be executed, to any extent\r\nin this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence\r\ndiscloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal\r\nor fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good\r\ncharacter. If the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one\r\nor two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars,\r\nthe case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect.\r\nThat on this contract, involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars, the\r\ncontractors would plan, and attempt to execute a fraud which, at the most,\r\ncould profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars,\r\nis to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in\r\nsuch a case, make far greater gains, proves that they did not, with\r\nguilty or fraudulent intent, make at all. The judgment and sentence are\r\ndisapproved, and declared null, and the defendants are fully discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN March 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 19, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that the plan of action for Missouri contained in your\r\nletter to the Governor of that State, and your other letter to me, is\r\nconcurred in by the Governor, it is approved by me, and you will be\r\nsustained in proceeding upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ORD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May [March] 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ORD, Army of the James\r\n\r\nIs it true that George W. Lane is detained at Norfolk without any charge\r\nagainst him? And if so why is it done?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JUDGE SCATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. WALTER B. SCATES, Centralia, Illinois:\r\n\r\nIf you choose to go to New Mexico and reside, I will appoint you chief\r\njustice there. What say you? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. HANCOCK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., March 22, 1865. MAJOR-GENERAL HANCOCK, Winchester, Va.:\r\n\r\nSeeing your despatch about General Crook, and fearing that through\r\nmisapprehension something unpleasant may occur, I send you below two\r\ndespatches of General Grant, which I suppose will fully explain General\r\nCrook's movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER FEMALE SPY\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DODGE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 23, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DODGE, Commanding, &c, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nAllow Mrs. R. S. Ewell the benefit of my amnesty proclamation on her\r\ntaking the oath.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 25, 1865. 8.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nArrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday. No war news. General Grant\r\ndoes not seem to know very much about Yeatman, but thinks very well of him\r\nso far as he does know.\r\n\r\nI like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him to remain or resign\r\nas best suits himself. Hearing this much from me, do as you think best in\r\nthe matter. General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as\r\nI understand from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their\r\nreceiving the document from us. Robert just now tells me there was a\r\nlittle rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\n(Cipher.)\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 25, 1865. (Received 5 P.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nI am here within five miles of the scene of this morning's action. I have\r\nnothing to add to what General Meade reports except that I have seen\r\nthe prisoners myself and they look like there might be the number he\r\nstates--1600.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865. (Received 11.30 A.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nI approve your Fort Sumter programme. Grant don't seem to know Yeatman\r\nvery well, but thinks very well of him so far as he knows. Thinks it\r\nprobable that Y. is here now, for the place. I told you this yesterday\r\nas well as that you should do as you think best about Mr. Whiting's\r\nresignation, but I suppose you did not receive the dispatch. I am on the\r\nboat and have no later war news than went to you last night.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 27, 1865.3.35 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nYours inclosing Fort Sumter order received. I think of but one suggestion.\r\nI feel quite confident that Sumter fell on the 13th, and not on the 14th\r\nof April, as you have it. It fell on Saturday, the 13th; the first call\r\nfor troops on our part was got up on Sunday, the 14th, and given date and\r\nissued on Monday, the 15th. Look up the old almanac and other data, and\r\nsee if I am not right.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865. 12 M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.: After your explanation, I think\r\nit is little or no difference whether the Fort Sumter ceremony takes place\r\non the 13th or 14th.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman tells me he is well acquainted with James Yeatman, and\r\nthat he thinks him almost the best man in the country for anything he will\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., March 30, 1865. 7.30 P.M. (Received 8.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nI begin to feel that I ought to be at home and yet I dislike to leave\r\nwithout seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement.\r\nHe has now been out since yesterday morning and although he has not been\r\ndiverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced\r\nso far as we know here. Last night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a\r\nrainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined in by\r\na heavy musketry fire opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours.\r\nThe sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns\r\nup the clouds. It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here\r\nscarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very\r\nlittle had been done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 31, 1865. 3 P.M.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY STANTON:\r\n\r\nAt 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: \"There has\r\nbeen much hard fighting this morning. The enemy drove our left from near\r\nDabney's house back well toward the Boydton plank road. We are now about\r\nto take the offensive at that point, and I hope will more than recover the\r\nlost ground.\"\r\n\r\nLater he telegraphed again as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Our troops, after being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and\r\ndrove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road, which we now have.\r\nThis gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning. I will send\r\nyou a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back. There\r\nhave been four flags captured to-day.\"\r\n\r\nJudging by the two points from which General Grant telegraphs, I infer\r\nthat he moved his headquarters about one mile since he sent the first of\r\nthe two despatches.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nYours to Colonel Bowers about the Secretary of War is shown to me. He is\r\nnot here, nor have I any notice that he is coming. I presume the mistake\r\ncomes of the fact that the Secretary of State was here. He started back to\r\nWashington this morning. I have your two despatches of this morning, and\r\nam anxious to hear from Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1, 1865. 12.50 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nI have had two despatches from General Grant since my last to you, but\r\nthey contain little additional, except that Sheridan also had pretty hot\r\nwork yesterday, that infantry was sent to his support during the night,\r\nand that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our\r\ncoachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, there\r\nto wait until she arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April, 1865. 5.30?.M.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nDespatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2\r\nP.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his\r\nown headquarters up to J. Boisseau's. The Five Forks were barricaded by\r\nthe enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry. This part of the\r\nenemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the\r\nmain force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them\r\nas closely as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. CITY POINT, April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nYours showing Sheridan's success of to-day is just received and highly\r\nappreciated. Having no great deal to do here, I am still sending the\r\nsubstance of your despatches to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 2, 1865. 8.30 A.M. (Received 9 A.M.)\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Executive Mansion:\r\n\r\nLast night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan with his\r\ncavalry and the Fifth Corps had captured three brigades of infantry, a\r\ntrain of wagons, and several batteries, prisoners amounting to several\r\nthousand. This morning General Grant having ordered an attack along the\r\nwhole line telegraphs as follows.\r\n\r\nRobert yesterday wrote a little cheerful note to Captain Penrose, which is\r\nall he has heard of him since you left.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO SECRETARY STANTON. CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1865. 8.30\r\nA.M.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nLast night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan, with his\r\ncavalry and the Fifth Corps, had captured three brigades of infantry, a\r\ntrain of wagons, and several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThis morning General Grant, having ordered an attack along the whole line,\r\ntelegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines. The battle now\r\nrages furiously. General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the Fifth corps, and\r\nMiles's Division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him this morning,\r\nis now sweeping down from the west.\r\n\r\n\"All now looks highly favorable. General Ord is engaged, but I have not\r\nyet heard the result in his front.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1. 11.00 A.M.\r\n\r\nDespatches are frequently coming in. All is going on finely. Generals\r\nParke, Wright, and Ord's lines are extending from the Appomattox to\r\nHatcher's Run. They have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines,\r\ntaking some forts, guns, and prisoners. Sheridan, with his own cavalry,\r\nthe Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the\r\nenemy's flank. Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nAt 10.45 A.M. General Grant telegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps. The Sixth\r\nCorps alone captured more than three thousand prisoners. The Second and\r\nTwenty-fourth Corps captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy,\r\nbut I cannot tell the numbers. We are now closing around the works of the\r\nline immediately enveloping Petersburg. All looks remarkably well. I\r\nhave not yet heard from Sheridan. His headquarters have been moved up\r\nto Banks's house, near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of\r\nPetersburg.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nAt 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours\r\nwill be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river\r\nabove. The whole captures since the army started out will not amount to\r\nless than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I\r\ndo not know the number of men and guns accurately, however. A portion of\r\nFoster's Division, Twenty Fourth Corps, made a most gallant charge this\r\nafternoon, and captured a very important fort from the enemy, with its\r\nentire garrison. All seems well with us, and everything is quiet just\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN. CITY POINT, VA., April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMRS. LINCOLN:\r\n\r\nAt 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs that he has Petersburg\r\ncompletely enveloped from river below to river above, and has captured,\r\nsince he started last Wednesday, about twelve thousand prisoners and fifty\r\nguns. He suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning, which I\r\nthink I will do. Tad and I are both well, and will be glad to see you and\r\nyour party here at the time you name.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

At your kind suggestion I\r\nthink I will meet you to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 3, 1865.8.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nThis morning Lieutenant-General Grant reports Petersburg evacuated, and he\r\nis confident that Richmond also is. He is pushing forward to cut off, if\r\npossible, the retreating rebel army.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 3, 1865. 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nYours received. Thanks for your caution, but I have already been to\r\nPetersburg. Staid with General Grant an hour and a half and returned here.\r\nIt is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go\r\nthere to-morrow. I will take care of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nGeneral Weitzel telegraphs from Richmond that of railroad stock he found\r\nthere twenty-eight locomotives, forty-four passenger and baggage cars, and\r\none hundred and six freight cars. At 3.30 this evening General Grant,\r\nfrom Sutherland's Station, ten miles from Petersburg toward Burkevllle,\r\ntelegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan picked up twelve hundred prisoners to-day, and from\r\nthree hundred to five hundred more have been gathered by other troops. The\r\nmajority of the arms that were left in the hands of the remnant of Lee's\r\narmy are now scattered between Richmond and where his troops are. The\r\ncountry is also full of stragglers; the line of retreat marked with\r\nartillery, ammunition, burned or charred wagons, caissons, ambulances,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, APRIL 5, 1865. (Received 11.55 PM.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. I think there is no probability of my remaining\r\nhere more than two days longer. If that is too long come down. I passed\r\nlast night at Richmond and have just returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, CITY POINT, April 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, in the Field:\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously\r\ninjured. This, with other matters, will take me to Washington soon. I was\r\nat Richmond yesterday and the day before, when and where Judge Campbell,\r\nwho was with Messrs. Hunter and Stephens in February, called on me, and\r\nmade such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal\r\npaper, repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to Mr.\r\nSeward, which you remember, and adding that if the war be now further\r\npersisted in by the rebels, confiscated property shall at the least bear\r\nthe additional cost, and that confiscation shall be remitted to the people\r\nof any State which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its troops\r\nand other support from resistance to the Government.\r\n\r\nJudge Campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel legislature of\r\nVirginia would do the latter if permitted; and accordingly I addressed a\r\nprivate letter to General Weitzel, with permission to Judge Campbell to\r\nsee it, telling him (General Weitzel) that if they attempt this, to permit\r\nand protect them, unless they attempt something hostile to the United\r\nStates, in which case to give them notice and time to leave, and to arrest\r\nany remaining after such time.\r\n\r\nI do not think it very probable that anything win come of this, but I\r\nhave thought best to notify you so that if you should see signs you may\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nFrom your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually\r\nwithdrawing the Virginia troops from opposition to the Government. Nothing\r\nthat I have done, or probably shall do, is to delay, hinder, or interfere\r\nwith your work.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES CITY POINT, April 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt has been intimated to me that the gentlemen who have acted as the\r\nlegislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion may now desire to\r\nassemble at Richmond and take measures to withdraw the Virginia troops and\r\nother support from resistance to the General Government. If they attempt\r\nit, give them permission and protection, until, if at all, they attempt\r\nsome action hostile to the United States, in which case you will notify\r\nthem, give them reasonable time to leave, and at the end of which time\r\narrest any who remain. Allow Judge Campbell to see this, but do not make\r\nit public.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 7, 1865 (Received 10.30 AM.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nAt 11.15 P.M. yesterday at Burkesville Station, General Grant sends me the\r\nfollowing from General Sheridan:\r\n\r\n\"April 6, 11.15 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report that the enemy made a stand at the intersection\r\nof the Burks Station road with the road upon which they were retreating.\r\nI attacked them with two divisions of the Sixth Army Corps and routed them\r\nhandsomely, making a connection with the cavalry. I am still pressing on\r\nwith both cavalry and infantry.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A CALL,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 10, 1865\r\n\r\nIf the company had assembled by appointment, some mistake had crept in\r\ntheir understanding. He had appeared before a larger audience than this\r\none to-day, and he would repeat what he then said, namely, he supposed\r\nowing to the great, good news, there would be some demonstration. He would\r\nprefer to-morrow evening, when he should be quite willing, and he hoped\r\nready, to say something. He desired to be particular, because every thing\r\nhe said got into print. Occupying the position he did, a mistake would\r\nproduce harm, and therefore he wanted to be careful not to make a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. H.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST PUBLIC ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 11, 1865\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS--We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness of\r\nheart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\r\nprincipal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace, whose\r\njoyous expression cannot be restrained. In the midst of this, however, He\r\nfrom whom blessings flow must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nA call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly\r\npromulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of\r\nrejoicing be overlooked. Their honors must not be parceled out with\r\nothers. I myself was near the front, and had the pleasure of transmitting\r\nmuch of the good news to you. But no part of the honor for plan or\r\nexecution is mine. To General Grant, his skillful officers, and brave men,\r\nall belongs. The gallant navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take\r\nactive part. By these recent successes, the reinauguration of the national\r\nauthority--reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from the\r\nfirst, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with\r\ngreat difficulty. Unlike a case of war between independent nations, there\r\nis no authorized organ for us to treat with--no one man has authority to\r\ngive up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with\r\nand mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a small\r\nadditional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves\r\nas to the mode, manner, and measure of reconstruction. As a general rule,\r\nI abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself, Wishing not to\r\nbe provoked by that to which I cannot properly offer an answer. In spite\r\nof this precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge that I am much\r\ncensured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the\r\nnew State government of Louisiana. In this I have done just so much and no\r\nmore than the public knows. In the Annual Message of December, 1863, and\r\nthe accompanying proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction,\r\nas the phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted by any State, would be\r\nacceptable to and sustained by the Executive Government of the nation. I\r\ndistinctly stated that this was not the only plan that might possibly be\r\nacceptable, and I also distinctly protested that the Executive claimed\r\nno right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in\r\nCongress from such States. This plan was in advance submitted to the then\r\nCabinet, and approved by every member of it. One of them suggested that I\r\nshould then and in that connection apply the Emancipation Proclamation to\r\nthe theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana; that I should\r\ndrop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people, and that I\r\nshould omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission\r\nof members of Congress. But even he approved every part and parcel of the\r\nplan which has since been employed or touched by the action of Louisiana.\r\nThe new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the whole\r\nState, practically applies the proclamation to the part previously\r\nexcepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people, and is\r\nsilent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the admission of members\r\nto Congress. So that, as it applied to Louisiana, every member of the\r\nCabinet fully approved the plan. The message went to Congress, and I\r\nreceived many commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not\r\na single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my\r\nknowledge until after the news reached Washington that the people of\r\nLouisiana had begun to move in accordance with it. From about July, 1862,\r\nI had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in\r\nseeking a reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana. When the\r\nmessage of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans,\r\nGeneral Banks wrote me that he was confident that the people, with his\r\nmilitary co-operation, would reconstruct substantially on that plan. I\r\nwrote to him and some of them to try it. They tried it, and the result\r\nis known. Such has been my only agency in getting up the Louisiana\r\ngovernment. As to sustaining it my promise is out, as before stated. But,\r\nas bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad\r\npromise and break it, whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it is\r\nadverse to the public interest; but I have not yet been so convinced. I\r\nhave been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one,\r\nin which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be\r\ndefinitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded States, so called,\r\nare in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps add astonishment to\r\nhis regret were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men\r\nendeavoring to answer that question, I have purposely forborne any public\r\nexpression upon it. As appears to me, that question has not been nor yet\r\nis a practically material one, and that any discussion of it, while it\r\nthus remains practically immaterial, could have no effect other than the\r\nmischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may become,\r\nthat question is bad as the basis of a controversy, and good for nothing\r\nat all--a merely pernicious abstraction. We all agree that the seceded\r\nStates, so called, are out of their proper practical relation with the\r\nUnion, and that the sole object of the Government, civil and military, in\r\nregard to those States, is to again get them into their proper practical\r\nrelation. I believe that it is not only possible, but in fact easier, to\r\ndo this without deciding or even considering whether those States have\r\never been out of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at\r\nhome, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had been abroad. Let\r\nus all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the proper practical\r\nrelations between these States and the Union, and each forever after\r\ninnocently indulge his own opinion whether, in doing the acts he\r\nbrought the States from without into the Union, or only gave them proper\r\nassistance, they never having been out of it. The amount of constituency,\r\nso to speak, on which the Louisiana government rests, would be more\r\nsatisfactory to all if it contained fifty thousand, or thirty thousand, or\r\neven twenty thousand, instead of twelve thousand, as it does. It is also\r\nunsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the\r\ncolored man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very\r\nintelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers. Still, the\r\nquestion is not whether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite\r\nall that is desirable. The question is, Will it be wiser to take it as\r\nit is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse? Can Louisiana be\r\nbrought into proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining\r\nor by discarding her new State government? Some twelve thousand voters\r\nin the heretofore Slave State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the\r\nUnion, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State,\r\nheld elections, organized a State government, adopted a Free State\r\nconstitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and\r\nwhite, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise\r\nupon the colored man. This Legislature has already voted to ratify the\r\nConstitutional Amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery\r\nthroughout the nation. These twelve thousand persons are thus fully\r\ncommitted to the Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State--committed\r\nto the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants--and they ask\r\nthe nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this committal.\r\nNow, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and\r\ndisperse them. We, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or\r\nworse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you. To the blacks we\r\nsay: This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held to your\r\nlips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the\r\nspilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where,\r\nand how. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white and black,\r\nhas any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with\r\nthe Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary,\r\nwe recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse\r\nof all this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of\r\ntwelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte\r\nfor it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a\r\ncomplete success. The colored man, too, in seeing all united for him, is\r\ninspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end. Grant\r\nthat he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by\r\nsaving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward\r\nover them? Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what\r\nit should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by\r\nhatching the egg than by smashing it. Again, if we reject Louisiana, we\r\nalso reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the National\r\nConstitution. To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more\r\nthan three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are\r\nnecessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not commit myself against\r\nthis, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable,\r\nand sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three\r\nfourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.\r\nI repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical\r\nrelation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new\r\nState government? What has been said of Louisiana will apply to other\r\nStates. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such\r\nimportant and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new\r\nand unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible plan\r\ncan safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive\r\nand inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement. Important\r\nprinciples may and must be inflexible. In the present situation as the\r\nphrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people\r\nof the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied\r\nthat action will be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., April 12, 1865. MAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch to Colonel Hardie about the matter of prayers.\r\nI do not remember hearing prayers spoken of while I was in Richmond; but I\r\nhave no doubt you have acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit\r\nand temper manifested by me while there. Is there any sign of the rebel\r\nlegislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you? If\r\nthere is any such sign, inform me what it is; if there is no such sign,\r\nyou may withdraw the offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL. WASHINGTON, D.C., April 12, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th. He assumes,\r\nas appears to me, that I have called the insurgent legislature of\r\nVirginia together, as the rightful legislature of the State, to settle all\r\ndifferences with the United States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of\r\nthem, not as a legislature, but as \"the gentlemen who have acted as\r\nthe legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion.\" I did this\r\non purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a\r\nrightful body. I deal with them as men having power de facto to do a\r\nspecific thing, to wit: \"To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support\r\nfrom resistance to the General Government,\" for which, in the paper handed\r\nJudge Campbell, I promised a specific equivalent, to wit: a remission to\r\nthe people of the State, except in certain cases, of the confiscation of\r\ntheir property. I meant this, and no more. Inasmuch, however, as Judge\r\nCampbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice,\r\ncontrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him, and\r\nparticularly as General Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so\r\nthat giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable,\r\nlet my letter to you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn,\r\nor countermanded, and he be notified of it. Do not now allow them to\r\nassemble, but if any have come, allow them safe return to their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH SCHUYLER COLFAX ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you\r\nvisit. I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation. I\r\nbelieve it practically inexhaustible. It abounds all over the Western\r\ncountry, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development\r\nhas scarcely commenced. During the war, when we were adding a couple of\r\nmillions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about\r\nencouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals. We had the\r\ncountry to save first. But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we\r\nknow pretty nearly the amount of our national debt, the more gold and\r\nsilver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier.\r\n\"Now,\" said he, speaking with more emphasis, \"I am going to encourage that\r\nin every possible way. We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded\r\nsoldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great\r\nnumbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply\r\nof labor than there will be demand for. I am going to try to attract them\r\nto the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough\r\nfor all. Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon\r\nour shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe.\r\nI intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the\r\nWest. Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the\r\nutmost of my ability; because their prosperity is the prosperity of the\r\nnation; and,\" said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, \"we shall prove,\r\nin a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL VAN ALLEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 14, 1865\r\n\r\nGENERAL VAN ALLEN:\r\n\r\nI intend to adopt the advice of my friends and use due precaution....\r\nI thank you for the assurance you give me that I shall be supported by\r\nconservative men like yourself, in the efforts I may make to restore the\r\nUnion, so as to make it, to use your language, a Union of hearts and hands\r\nas well as of States.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN'S LAST WRITTEN WORDS\r\n\r\nAllow Mr. Ashmer and friend to come in at 9 A.M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. April 14, 1865",
