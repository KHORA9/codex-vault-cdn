King Edward of England, who had been\r\nundergoing a “cure” at Marienbad, was expected at Ischl, where the\r\nAustrian Court was in residence. The whole place was hung with\r\nflags that were put up at the last moment, as the “Gem of the\r\nSalzkammergut,” as Ischl is often called, is one of the wettest spots\r\nin the country. The local trains brought large numbers of peasants,\r\nin their picturesque costume, who wanted to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity of seeing the King of England. Other “peasants,” in\r\nbadly-fitting costumes, also came down in the Vienna night express.\r\nTheir white knees, left bare beneath the short leather breeches,\r\nplainly showed that they were not accustomed to wearing the Styrian\r\ncostume. The peasant girls eyed them dubiously; one suggested that a\r\nlittle walnut-juice would improve matters, while their little brothers\r\nwhispered “police.” The real peasants crowded around the station,\r\nand watched the red carpet being laid, ready for royalty. They then\r\nturned to see Emperor Francis Joseph drive up to the gates. He arrived\r\ntwenty minutes before the train was expected, as usual, for being\r\na great stickler for etiquette he always feared that some accident\r\nor _contretemps_ might delay him, and the visitor reach the station\r\nbefore the host. He dreaded nothing so much as a breach of etiquette\r\nor good manners, and was willing to take any trouble to avoid even the\r\npossibility of such a thing. The train from Marienbad steamed into the\r\nstation, the monarchs embraced; their intercourse had always been most\r\ncordial. The King respected the simple old man, who had until then\r\nguided the destinies of his country with great astuteness; while the\r\nEmperor of Austria esteemed the statesman, for in Austria-Hungary and\r\nthe Balkans King Edward was reckoned as the most skilful diplomatist\r\nof his time. As the Imperial carriage, with the gilt wheels, drove\r\nthrough the streets, the people cheered heartily. King Edward was\r\nthe most popular of foreign monarchs in Austria, and the minimum of\r\nprecautions were taken for his safety. In spite of this the Austrian\r\npolice, ever watchful, took stock of every fresh arrival in the place\r\nfor days before the King appeared. On the morning of the visit they\r\nascertained what persons would be seated in windows commanding the line\r\nof route, and carefully watched the houses that might harbour anarchist\r\nor other assassins. The uninitiated suspected nothing of all this. The\r\nlong line of firemen that lined the streets looked like members of the\r\nlocal brigade. It was not suspected that they were specially trained\r\nmen, who knew how to act and to co-operate at the right moment with\r\nthe “peasants,” also members of the same highly-organised force. They\r\nall stood apparently careless and inattentive. Presently a carriage,\r\nin which a spare, tall, pock-marked man was seated, drove through the\r\nstreet. He was the Emperor’s private detective. His appearance always\r\nheralded that of the monarchs, and the firemen braced themselves for a\r\ncombined movement, either to the right or left, forwards or backwards,\r\nas previously arranged. The police behind helped with the work, and\r\njust as the Imperial carriage flashed by, everyone in the crowd pushed\r\nforward, sideways, or backwards, as though by accident. Any intending\r\nassassin would have lost his place at the front, and have missed the\r\ngolden opportunity, through this clever manœuvre of the police. These\r\nprecautions were always taken for every Royal visitor, for although\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph himself was accustomed to stroll about the Ischl\r\nwoods, and went hunting in the forests quite unattended, he took care\r\nthat his guests were exposed to no risks.\r\n\r\nEverything went off as arranged, although there was a strained feeling\r\nin the air, partly due to the thundery weather. It was known, too, that\r\nKing Edward was on a diplomatic tour throughout Europe, and the people\r\nknew that meetings of monarchs in summer are often of great importance,\r\neven when they are unaccompanied by their Ministers. Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph is practically a despotic monarch, for the Austro-Hungarian\r\nConstitution exists merely on paper. He alone decides the foreign\r\npolicy of the country, and determines whether there shall be peace\r\nor war. Thus he is in a position to make decisions for his country,\r\nwithout consulting his Ministers. Austria-Hungary had long been quiet,\r\nalmost to the point of stagnation. Her statesmen had been fully\r\noccupied in paying off the burdens incurred during the last war, and\r\nwere now delighted that, after a succession of deficits, they could at\r\nlength turn out Budgets with surpluses at the end of the financial year.\r\n\r\nThere was trouble with Servia, it is true, Austrian machinations had\r\ndeprived Servia of an outlet to the sea. Servia, being a pastoral and\r\nagricultural country, wished to sell her products, and Austria, the\r\nnatural market, was closed to her.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, who were very short of meat, promised to take over\r\nServian meat, but the Hungarian agrarians, or large land-owners, who\r\nwanted to keep up the prices of their own products, managed to prevent\r\nthis. They appointed veterinary surgeons to examine imported meat; and\r\nby unjustly condemning the Servian meat at the frontier, they succeeded\r\nin preventing its import. This line of conduct caused much greater\r\ndiscontent among the Servs than a downright refusal to admit their\r\nproducts would have done. They naturally objected to being cheated by\r\ntheir powerful and unscrupulous neighbours, and the friction caused\r\nby the “Servian Pig” question was continual. Otherwise the Balkans\r\nwere strangely, almost uncannily, quiet. There were no massacres to\r\nreport, no bands who roamed the country and committed depredations.\r\nIt seemed that the two monarchs could have nothing to discuss. As the\r\nEmperor brought the King back to the Hotel Elisabeth in the afternoon,\r\nthe faces of both monarchs could be seen very plainly in the blaze of\r\nthe sun that was pouring down with great fierceness. Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph looked much older than he had done that morning. His face was\r\ndrawn, the fine lines on the parchment-like skin were deepened. It did\r\nnot need any unusual acuteness to see that something had gone wrong.\r\nKing Edward walked up to his suite of rooms with something weary in his\r\nstep. The Emperor, freed from the restraint of the King’s presence,\r\nreturned to the Imperial villa, his slight frame shrunken to half its\r\nusual size, his soldierly bearing gone.\r\n\r\nAll Ischl went home to dress for the gala performance at the tiny Court\r\ntheatre. It was always difficult to get tickets at the bijou theatre\r\nwhen members of the Imperial family were expected; on the night of King\r\nEdward’s visit it was impossible to obtain them. The police excluded\r\nall foreigners by careful manipulation. By evening it was already\r\nknown in Ischl that the Emperor and the King had quarrelled violently.\r\nAttendants, posted behind doors, ready to spring to attention,\r\noverhear many things. They could give no details of what the subject\r\nunder discussion had been, but they said that Emperor Francis Joseph\r\nhad lost his temper in the presence of a foreign King, and although\r\noutbursts of this kind were common enough within the family, it was an\r\nunprecedented thing in the presence of a stranger. They knew that the\r\noccasion had been no ordinary one, and that the future policy of the\r\ncountry had been under consideration.\r\n\r\nJust as the curtain went up for the performance of some light musical\r\ncomedy, the sort of play that is at its very best in Vienna, the\r\nthunderstorm that had been threatening all day long, broke outside.\r\nThe rain rattled down on the roof of the theatre. The real heroine of\r\nthe piece, who had been brought down from the capital on purpose, was\r\na dazzlingly beautiful woman; she laughed, danced, and pirouetted all\r\nover the stage. She was the very embodiment of Vienna “cheek.” Just\r\nat the end of the first act--royalty never sees a piece through when\r\non State visits--she abruptly turned her back towards the Imperial\r\nbox. She was lightly clad, even for the Austrian stage, as she tripped\r\nlaughingly to the front, and carried out her instructions. A thrill\r\nwent through the audience. Would the King understand? His British\r\nphlegm stood him in good stead. He remained in his seat, although\r\nhe was sufficiently acquainted with Austrian manners and customs to\r\ncomprehend the somewhat heavy witticism. Only when the curtain fell did\r\nhe rise and leave the theatre. “What was the meaning of the insult?”\r\nasked all Ischl. “What did it portend?” They learnt the answer just\r\nseven years later to the very day.\r\n\r\nThe people about the palace discussed the incident at the theatre. They\r\nunderstood that it was meant as a hint to the King that his presence in\r\nAustria was not desired, if he came to discuss politics. As a private\r\nfriend and a brother monarch he was always welcome. He had attempted\r\nto show the Emperor that the close alliance with Germany was not for\r\nthe good of Europe. Not merely that, but Austria-Hungary herself would\r\nimperil her existence as a great Power if she allowed herself to become\r\nmerged in Germany. The aged Emperor, who had long been accustomed to\r\ndepend upon Germany for assistance against the Slavs, would not listen\r\nto the King. He was perhaps aware that his policy was wrong, but being\r\nobstinate, like all the Habsburgs, he would not acknowledge it. He did\r\nnot intend to alter his policy at the eleventh hour, in any case. If\r\nthere must be a change let his successor see to it. King Edward made\r\ndue allowance for the Emperor’s age, but it is doubtful whether he ever\r\nagain made any direct effort to turn Austria from her fatal path. She\r\nstood at the parting of the ways. Her Emperor chose her destiny that\r\nsummer day in Ischl. Diplomatists and Ambassadors took up the King’s\r\ntask; they repeatedly pointed out the disastrous consequences of the\r\nclose alliance with Germany. Instead of discussing the situation with\r\nItaly, Austria-Hungary informed Germany of what was happening. Instead\r\nof keeping the balance equal between Italy and Germany, Austria-Hungary\r\nreally concluded a partnership with Germany; the Triple Alliance\r\ndegenerated into a Dual Alliance that kept up an understanding with\r\nthe third partner. Italy was quick to realise this. So long as Russia\r\nand France were allied, and occupied a position that was a set-off to\r\nthat held by Germany and an Austria that had not given up her liberty\r\nof action, European peace was assured. Great Britain and Italy were not\r\nbound to their Allies to any great extent.\r\n\r\nThe result of the meeting at Ischl soon made itself felt. Italian\r\ndiplomatists began to back out of their obligations towards Germany\r\nand Austria-Hungary. Their policy of “cooling down,” at first barely\r\nperceptible, took form somewhat later, at the renewal of the Triple\r\nAlliance, when Italy promised very little in return for the many\r\n“benefits” heaped upon her by Germany. Great Britain, aware of the\r\ndanger of the centre of the European chessboard being occupied by one\r\nvast State, stretching from the North Sea and Baltic to the Adriatic,\r\nwas more inclined to listen to advances from France and Russia, and\r\nto deliberate upon the advantages of a closer contact with Germany’s\r\nenemies. The suggestion made by France, that Great Britain should\r\nintroduce conscription, prevented the understanding becoming anything\r\nmore. France pointed out the necessity of preparing for an aggressive\r\nmove on the part of Germany, but Great Britain would not even\r\nconsider a proposition so far from her theories of government as was\r\nconscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR’S ILLNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Court returned to Vienna as soon as the first snows on\r\nthe mountains round Ischl gave warning that the summer season was at\r\nan end. Emperor Francis Joseph, who is a strenuous worker, and carries\r\non the business of State daily, whether in residence in Vienna or in\r\nthe country, began his life as usual. On certain days of the week he\r\nheld general audiences, and received anyone, high or low, aristocrat\r\nor peasant, who wished to present a petition. He was always up at 4\r\na.m., and had got through most of his State duties by 8 a.m., when\r\nhe began to receive Ministers and others. In the month of October\r\nit was suddenly announced that the Emperor was ill. The news caused\r\ngreat consternation, as the monarch had never been ill in his life.\r\nHe had been confined to his room for some time as a young man after\r\nan attempt made on his life, when he was stabbed in the neck, but he\r\nhad never had the slightest ailment since. His life was carefully\r\nregulated by the Court physician, Doctor Kerzl, a military surgeon, a\r\nrough doctor of the old school, who had grown old with the Emperor.\r\nMembers of the Imperial family frequently tried to have a younger and\r\nmore up-to-date man appointed as Court physician. They considered\r\nthat the Emperor’s health was so precious that its care ought not to\r\nbe confided to a man who had gained his experience with the Army. The\r\nEmperor, however, stood firm, and the results of the somewhat draconic\r\ntreatment have certainly justified his decision. The Emperor sleeps\r\non a camp-bed, eats the heavy Vienna food with relish, and is always\r\naccustomed to drive in an open carriage without his military cloak. It\r\nis probable that he took the chill during the drive.\r\n\r\nSpecialists were summoned to the Emperor’s bedside, and they found\r\nthat the Royal patient was suffering from inflammation of the lungs.\r\nHe, however, refused to go to bed. Crowds of people went out to the\r\nsummer palace of Schönbrunn, where he was staying, and waited under\r\nhis window until he appeared to reassure them, when cheers rang out\r\nand echoed along the arched corridors beneath the palace. The anxiety\r\nfelt by the common people was shared by everyone in Austria-Hungary,\r\nand the one hope of high and low was that the Emperor might live.\r\nThis was not so much on account of his personal popularity, although\r\nthis was great, as because of the dread of the future. The heir to\r\nthe throne, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, was the most hated man in\r\nAustria-Hungary. The Emperor’s death meant that he would succeed to\r\nthe throne. The Emperor himself felt a profound hatred for his heir,\r\nand it was a matter of common knowledge that he was filled with a firm\r\ndetermination not only to recover from his illness, but to outlive his\r\nheir. Day after day the struggle went on within the white walls of\r\nSchönbrunn Palace; the daily papers spoke of the Emperor’s illness as\r\na slight cold, for the monarch was not satisfied with reading extracts\r\nfrom the official organs, as was his ordinary custom, but insisted\r\nupon having all the papers, opposition organs as well as bounty-fed\r\nperiodicals, brought to his room. He wished to find out whether the\r\ndoctors were telling the truth about his illness. The three specialists\r\ncame to the conclusion that he could not recover; Doctor Kerzl alone\r\nstood firm and said that he would get well again. The Emperor refused\r\nto take to his bed, having a superstitious horror of lying down in the\r\ndaytime. Kerzl supported him in this, and it is probable that he owed\r\nhis recovery to it. The disputes among the doctors were unseemly, and\r\nthe specialists insisted on calling the family to Vienna. Archduchess\r\nGisela, the Emperor’s elder daughter, arrived in great haste, and his\r\nyounger daughter, Valerie, also appeared on the scene. Both women\r\nare very pious, and they immediately wished the Emperor to receive\r\nExtreme Unction. The Archbishop of Vienna, with a retinue of priests,\r\nactually came out to Schönbrunn to administer it, but they were met\r\ndownstairs by Frau Catherina Schraatt, who told them that it would\r\nfrighten him to death, and induced them to return without carrying out\r\ntheir mission. Archduke Francis Ferdinand arrived at the capital. He\r\nand his morganatic wife, Duchess Hohenberg, established themselves at\r\nthe Belvedere Palace for the season. The Archduke, a man who lacked\r\nrefinement and who was utterly devoid of tact, immediately began to act\r\nas if he had already succeeded to the throne. Statesmen, fearing that\r\nthe Emperor would never recover, were afraid to oppose him, and he got\r\nan insight into affairs of State during the Emperor’s illness that\r\nenabled him to assume a position that he never gave up afterwards. The\r\nHabsburgs were obliged to look on while Duchess Hohenberg, then merely\r\nCountess Chotek, took a position that would never have been conceded\r\nto her had the Emperor been in his usual health. Kaiser Wilhelm, ever\r\nwatchful, began to count on the possibility of the Emperor’s death,\r\nand the friendship between him and the Archduke dates from this epoch.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm did not like the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary;\r\nhe recognised the fact that he would have to deal with a determined\r\nman, who knew exactly what he wanted and would refuse to believe\r\nthe flattering assurances that satisfied Emperor Francis Joseph,\r\nwho, although still in full command of his mental faculties, was\r\nbeginning to feel the weight of years. The Emperor was never so acute\r\na man as his heir; the Archduke, too, had a wife whose intelligence\r\nwas remarkable. Countess Chotek was ambitious, and her husband was\r\naccustomed to following her advice in State affairs. Kaiser Wilhelm\r\ntherefore shared the wish of the Austrian people, that the aged Emperor\r\nmight long be spared to them. Week after week went by. People from all\r\nparts of the monarchy sent the Emperor quaint remedies, charms, and\r\nspecifics of all kinds to cure his illness; several officials were\r\nengaged all day in writing to thank the senders, who were not even\r\naware of what ailed the Emperor. When it was finally announced that\r\nhe was out of danger there was great jubilation throughout the realm;\r\nthe people poured scorn upon the specialists, and acclaimed Dr. Kerzl\r\nas the saviour of the country whenever they could catch sight of his\r\nrough, honest face, bronzed by exposure upon many a battlefield. The\r\nEmperor had given his attendants great trouble during his illness and\r\nconvalescence, as he had refused to allow anyone to enter his rooms\r\nexcept Dr. Kerzl, his soldier-valet, who slept upon a rug in the\r\nantechamber of his bedroom, and the sentry, who always paced to and\r\nfro outside the Emperor’s bedchamber, and watched through a spyhole,\r\ncunningly made in the door, for any change. No woman was allowed to\r\nenter the suite of rooms during the night hours, the patient saying he\r\npreferred an orderly to nurse him.\r\n\r\nGradually the Emperor recovered his powers. He was never the same man\r\nagain; his vigour was gone, and, although he was little changed in\r\nappearance, his grasp upon affairs had weakened. The Archduke, who\r\ndisliked Vienna cordially, remained in town, a thorn in the Emperor’s\r\nside. The latter, however, could find no pretext for dismissing him to\r\nthe country. Councillors, already anticipating the probable demise of\r\nthe reigning monarch at no distant date, advised the Emperor to consult\r\nwith his heir and to try to inculcate the inexperienced man with some\r\nof his statecraft. The Emperor was induced to bestow some powers upon\r\nthe Archduke, although much against his will, and a new era in the\r\nhistory of the country began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nARCHDUKE FRANCIS FERDINAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Europe was asking one and the same question at this epoch: “What\r\nkind of a man is the heir to the throne?”\r\n\r\nThey got the answer that he was “a little-known man,” and this was true\r\nto a certain extent. The Emperor, an old autocrat, never allowed any\r\nmember of the Imperial family to take a leading part in public affairs.\r\nThey were expected to do their duty in opening charitable institutions,\r\npresiding at _fêtes_ in provincial cities, but in both Vienna and\r\nBudapesth they found it advisable to keep well in the background.\r\nWhenever a young Archduke became too popular, even in the ballrooms\r\nof Vienna, he was promptly banished to some out-of-the-way place,\r\nostensibly on a mission, but really as a punishment for presuming to\r\ncourt popularity.\r\n\r\nThis was well understood among the Habsburgs, who, as a rule, did not\r\ncare for Court life. Most of the Archdukes lived on their country\r\nestates, where they enjoyed almost regal power for nine months of the\r\nyear, merely coming to Court to pay their respects to the monarch at\r\nthe New Year.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand was very fond of power and very ambitious,\r\nbut he did not care for playing the _rôle_ of heir to the throne when\r\nhe had reached middle age and was at the height of his powers. He\r\ntherefore remained in the country for the greater part of the year.\r\n\r\nThis did not increase his popularity. People grumbled at the sadness\r\nthat hung like a pall over the Court. They said that it was merely a\r\nresort for military men and officials, and wished that young life could\r\nbe introduced to restore Vienna and Budapesth to their former gaiety.\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand had laboured under great disadvantages\r\nsince sudden and unexpected events had made him heir to the throne.\r\nHis attendants and the Court officials summed up the position in one\r\nsentence: “He has never been trained for a throne.” He was entirely\r\nlacking in tact--a quality which, if not a natural gift, must be\r\nacquired by painful experience by personages who will one day occupy\r\na throne. He spoke no languages except his own. He had, of course,\r\nsome knowledge of French and Italian, and was learning Hungarian; but\r\nhe was not in a position to carry on delicate negotiations in French.\r\nHe had a bad record even for an Austrian Archduke. His youthful\r\ncareer had been full of incident, and his doctors had been compelled\r\nto put a sudden stop to a course of youthful dissipation by sending\r\nhim on a voyage round the world. He was reported to be suffering from\r\nconsumption in its preliminary stages, and it was said his only chance\r\nof life was a complete change of climate. The Archduke, who was an\r\nartist and well acquainted with ancient and modern culture, started\r\noff on the Imperial yacht for the East with nothing but pleasurable\r\nfeelings. His favourite study was ethnology, and he made a collection\r\nof objects of great interest during this voyage. They were to be seen\r\nin one of the galleries of the Hofburg, which had recently been added\r\nto the main block of the town palace. The Archduke converted the new\r\npart into a museum, as the Emperor had forbidden the architect to fit\r\nthe new building with lifts or other modern appliances. Lifts he hated,\r\nand firmly refused to enter one even when he was having his portrait\r\npainted by an artist whose studio was on the sixth floor of a Vienna\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke, who was intensely modern, decided that a palace without\r\nlifts and proper heating appliances was not fit to live in, and\r\npromptly converted the new gallery into a picture gallery and museum\r\nwithout waiting for the Emperor’s advice or permission.\r\n\r\nThe aged Emperor and his heir clashed in every direction; they were\r\ndiametrically opposed in all their tastes and convictions. Both were\r\npious to an exaggerated degree. The Emperor disliked the Jesuits; his\r\nheir consorted with them constantly, and listened to their advice in\r\nmatters of State. This alone would have been sufficient to prevent the\r\nEmperor from ever wishing him to succeed to the throne. The Archduke,\r\ntoo, although so pious, had contrived to estrange both the Church\r\nand the Emperor by one act of boyish folly. As a young officer he\r\nwas stationed at a depôt in the depths of the country to learn his\r\nprofession, far from critical crowds. One day he was riding across the\r\nfields, when some peasants, carrying the mortal remains of one of their\r\nfellows, crossed by the footpath. The Archduke, in a fit of youthful\r\nexuberance, set his horse at the bier and cleared it at a jump. The\r\npriest protested at the act of sacrilege. The story reached the ears\r\nof the Emperor, who never forgave him. Although the Archduke was not\r\ncareful of the feelings of the Roman Catholics, the non-Catholics in\r\nthe country believed that he would be capable of persecuting them with\r\na rigour such as had been unknown since the Middle Ages. At the time of\r\nthe Emperor’s illness the Liberal papers prophesied in their leading\r\narticles that he would build up martyr fires around the Cathedral\r\nof St. Stefan, in the centre of Vienna. They said he would show the\r\nutmost relentlessness in burning or hanging his Jewish, Protestant, and\r\nMahommedan subjects, all of whom were accustomed to a wide tolerance,\r\nbased on indifference to them and their doings. The Archduke was\r\nbitterly hated in Hungary; it was commonly reported that his life was\r\nnot safe in that part of his future kingdom. He gave colour to these\r\nreports by his strange conduct. When he went down to Budapesth he did\r\nnot put up at an hotel, as was customary. He remained all night in\r\nthe royal train, which was run up the line to a siding, no one being\r\naware of the exact spot at which it had drawn up. This confession\r\nof fear and lack of confidence in the loyalty of his subjects did\r\nthe Archduke great harm. The alternative explanation, sometimes\r\nadvanced, that the Archduke, who was known as the meanest man in the\r\nkingdom, merely wished to save an hotel bill, did not improve matters.\r\nThe hotel-keepers looked upon members of the Imperial House as most\r\ndesirable guests; they never overcharged them, for the advertisement\r\nwas worth a great deal to them. Archdukes who neither commanded a\r\npalace to be prepared for their coming nor put up at an hotel were\r\nnaturally not popular with anyone. Archduke Francis Ferdinand crowned\r\nall his other delinquencies by his marriage. Instead of contracting\r\nan alliance with some powerful reigning house, he made a morganatic\r\nmarriage with a lady-in-waiting. Countess Chotek was a Bohemian\r\naristocrat, it is true, but she was not a peer of any member of the\r\nHouse of Habsburg. The Emperor allowed the marriage to take place,\r\nand when all the circumstances are taken into account, especially\r\nthe ease with which persons whose existence was disagreeable to the\r\nVienna Court were removed, it can only be concluded that the Emperor\r\napproved of the marriage. He evidently did not wish the children of the\r\nArchduke to come to the throne on account of their father’s tendency\r\nto tuberculosis, which was reported to have gone to the brain. It was\r\ncommon knowledge that the Archduke was accustomed to fly into fearful\r\nrages. Whether this habit, which is common to all the Habsburgs, was\r\nowing to epilepsy, or some obscure brain disease, it is difficult to\r\nsay; but the Emperor evidently shared the common feeling that it was\r\nsome obscure affection of the brain, and shared the doctors’ opinion\r\nthat the Archduke’s descendants ought not to come to the throne of\r\nAustria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, who was always short of money, tried to\r\nengage in business, and, as usually happens with men of his position,\r\nmade a sad failure of it. Instead of leaving the management of his\r\nestates to stewards, who would only take their customary perquisites,\r\nhe engaged in business transactions himself. He was badly swindled, and\r\ngained a reputation for meanness which was richly deserved. His varied\r\nexcursions into the realms of speculative business were attended by no\r\nbetter luck. He dared not associate himself with eminent business men,\r\nso he summoned a number of companions to his side who were difficult to\r\nshake off. With them he embarked upon business of an illegitimate kind.\r\nHis only excuse was his complete lack of understanding of all matters\r\nrelating to business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUCHESS HOHENBERG. WIFE OF THE ARCHDUKE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCHDUKE FRANCIS FERDINAND.]\r\n\r\nNeither Archduke Francis Ferdinand nor his morganatic wife had the\r\ntact or sense to hide the impatience with which they awaited the aged\r\nEmperor’s death. The “parrot” story, as it was called, went the round\r\nof the Vienna _cafés_ at this period. A bird of very rare plumage,\r\nevidently the property of some aristocratic personage, was found\r\nstraying in the public gardens of Vienna. A gardener promptly caught it\r\nand took it round to the police, where lost property of all kinds was\r\ndeposited, until its owner could be found. The sergeant in charge put\r\nthe bird in a cage and forgot all about it. Shortly afterwards he was\r\nstartled to hear the parrot begin to discourse with great fluency when\r\nit had become used to its surroundings. It referred to various members\r\nof the Imperial family in terms of the very scantiest respect. “That\r\nold cat Valerie” was its delicate way of referring to the Emperor’s\r\nyounger and favourite daughter. “Peacocks, sluts” were terms of abuse\r\napplied to Archduchesses who either overdressed or neglected their\r\ntoilettes. The sergeant became pale with fright. It was _lése-majesté_\r\nto listen to such words, and the penalty might be death. When the\r\nparrot broke into a steady stream of talk, with a kind of refrain,\r\n“He’ll live to be a hundred, Sofie,” in an exact imitation of the\r\ngruff tones of the heir to the throne, who was evidently referring to\r\nthe Emperor, the sergeant felt that any further eavesdropping would\r\nbe dangerous. He picked up a cloth, threw it over this utterer of\r\nhigh treason, and carried the loquacious bird to the chief of the\r\npolice. The cloth was removed, and the indignant parrot, unused to such\r\ntreatment, began worse than before. The sergeant was dispatched in all\r\nhaste to find a very thick black cloth that might be calculated to damp\r\neven the ardour of an Imperial parrot, and, carefully wrapped up, the\r\nbird was sent to the Belvedere, where the Archduke and his wife were in\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOUNTESS CHOTEK\r\n\r\n\r\nCountess Chotek, afterwards Duchess Hohenberg, the morganatic wife of\r\nthe late Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary,\r\nwas a most remarkable woman, and her history is perhaps the most\r\nromantic that was ever written. She belonged to an impoverished\r\nBohemian family, which ranked high among the ancient aristocracy of\r\nthat nation. She was brought up very quietly and was accustomed, as a\r\ngirl, to ride in the tramway in Dresden, where her father held a post\r\nin the Diplomatic Service. Her dresses were very plain, even for an\r\naristocrat. The peculiar charm that she possessed, however, made her\r\nan object of much attention. She was a big blonde, as stately as an\r\nempress, and at the same time a woman who knew how to make herself\r\nagreeable in conversation, as her life had given her an intimate\r\nknowledge of men and things that was unusual in a woman belonging to\r\na noble family, in Austria-Hungary, where the little aristocrats are\r\nconvent-bred, and never encouraged to form opinions of their own upon\r\nthe current topics of the hour. She was very ambitious, and intelligent\r\nto an extraordinary degree. She was a woman who knew just what she\r\nwanted, and who would not have hesitated to use any means that were\r\nnecessary for the attainment of her object. She made her entrance\r\ninto the Austrian Imperial family in a very subordinate position.\r\nShe became lady-in-waiting to the beautiful daughters of Archduke\r\nFrederick, the richest of all the Archdukes. Her life in his family\r\nwas probably not disagreeable, but decidedly monotonous, as the family\r\nspent most of the time on lonely country estates in Hungary. Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand frequented the Vienna palace, on the Albrecht Platz,\r\nwhere Archduke Frederick lived when in residence at Court. Everyone\r\nbelieved that he was about to marry one of the Archduke’s daughters,\r\nand the match was regarded as a good one. The girls had large dowries,\r\nand relationship between the heir to the throne and the branch of the\r\nfamily to which they belonged was very distant. It is probable that\r\nthe Archduke had some such arrangement in his mind when he visited\r\nthe house. He, however, fell violently and irretrievably in love with\r\nthe lady-in-waiting, a woman in the early thirties, and regarded as\r\nlong past marriageable age in Court circles. The romantic story of the\r\nmarriage is well known, but the fact that the Archduke, in marrying\r\nthe lady-in-waiting, made an inveterate enemy of Archduke Frederick\r\nwas never appreciated at its proper value abroad. In Vienna itself\r\nthe gravity of the position was well understood. No better-class\r\ntradesman in Austria would allow such an insult to his daughters to go\r\nunrevenged, for the Austrian father is very jealous of his daughters’\r\nreputation. No young man is permitted to visit at a house regularly\r\nwithout having the clearest “intentions.” At the Court this unwritten\r\nlaw is much stricter than among the people. The Archduke, in selecting\r\nthe lady-in-waiting, was casting a slur upon the Archduchesses she\r\nattended. Fortunately, there were several girls, and as he had never\r\nsingled out any one of them for particular attention, there was no\r\nopen rupture. It is certain, however, that the Archduke behaved in a\r\nvery ungentlemanly way, and that his conduct was totally lacking in\r\ndelicacy. Archduke Frederick never forgave the insult, and the other\r\nmembers of the House of Habsburg sympathised with him in his wrath\r\nat the incident. Indeed, the outraged father had plenty of occasion\r\nto remember it. His daughter, Archduchess Isabella, who had hoped to\r\nbecome the future Empress of Austria, made an unfortunate marriage\r\nlater on. Her parents, by way of settling the incident of the heir to\r\nthe throne, and laying the ghosts of rumours that still hung round\r\nthe girl’s name, arranged a match with Prince George of Bavaria.\r\nThe Archduchess, who hated the young man, actually set fire to her\r\nwedding-dress on the eve of the marriage, hoping that it would be put\r\noff, as she had nothing suitable to wear.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, she set fire to the palace, and a valuable collection\r\nof pictures in the adjacent museum was threatened. The marriage took\r\nplace on the morrow, a dress having been hurriedly contrived for the\r\noccasion. The girl fled from her husband on the wedding journey, and\r\nafterwards became a Red Cross nurse. For these misfortunes the Archduke\r\nwas regarded as primarily responsible and they served to make Countess\r\nChotek still more detestable to the Imperial family.\r\n\r\nOn his marriage Archduke Francis Ferdinand renounced all rights to\r\nthe throne and to any dignities or privileges belonging to members\r\nof the House of Habsburg for his heirs. He and his wife withdrew into\r\nobscurity, where a family of beautiful children was born to them.\r\nThis led Countess Chotek to dream of altering the laws of succession\r\nand securing the throne for her eldest son. With this ulterior object\r\nin view she came to Vienna at the time of the Emperor’s illness, and\r\ntried to force her way into Court society. Her rank entitled her to\r\nbe received at Court, but not to be admitted into the magic circle of\r\nthe Austrian Imperial family as one of themselves. The etiquette of\r\nthe Vienna Court is the strictest in Europe, and is based upon that\r\nruling at the Spanish Court. The members of the Habsburg family are\r\nall extremely simple, but they permit no liberties to be taken either\r\nwith themselves or the family. Countess Chotek, as she was then,\r\nappeared at the Court ball unannounced. She intended to surprise the\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies, and force him to allow her to enter with\r\nthe Archduchesses. The old man did not lose his presence of mind. He\r\nmet the difficulty in a very clever way. The married Archduchesses\r\nwalked in first, each with her cavalier, selected especially for the\r\nhonour. After the long procession of handsome, stately dames with\r\nflowing trains had passed into the brilliantly-lighted room, the young\r\nArchduchesses who were presented at Court for the first time were led\r\ninto the hall, each on the arm of a handsome young officer. Eight\r\ngirls, dressed in simple muslin gowns that barely reached to their\r\nankles, and looking very childish, as none was more than eighteen years\r\nof age, came next in the long procession. The Master of the Ceremonies,\r\nwho had detained Countess Chotek, found her a place, on the left arm\r\nof the last cavalier, the youngest of the Archduchesses occupying the\r\npost of honour on the right. Countess Chotek entered the ball-room\r\ninwardly raging. Everyone noticed the insult, as the other ladies all\r\nhad a cavalier to themselves. The next morning the Vienna newspapers\r\nalluded to the slight which had been put upon the wife of the heir to\r\nthe throne, and said that the Master of the Ceremonies should have\r\nremembered that the Countess was a woman, and have refrained from so\r\npointed an insult. Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife left Vienna\r\nthe next day as a protest, and this was the last occasion upon which he\r\ntried to force his wife upon the Court.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm, whose emissaries always kept him well informed of every\r\nevent, big or little, in Vienna, heard of the incident. Now was the\r\ntime for him to interfere. The Archduke, who had always turned a deaf\r\near to blandishments from Berlin, would now be accessible. The man\r\nwho was too strong to care to hear flattery of himself would lend a\r\nwilling ear to any defence of his beautiful wife, who had been grossly\r\ninsulted. The Archduke became more deeply attached to his wife every\r\nyear; the inconveniences to which he was subjected for her sake only\r\nstrengthened his affection. When, therefore, an invitation for the\r\nArchduke and his wife came from Berlin it was gratefully accepted.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm, whose wife, the Empress, has never been allowed to have\r\nmuch voice in things, placed Countess Chotek in the place of honour,\r\nand, what is vastly more important, caused the fact to be chronicled\r\nin the German and Austrian papers. The Archduchesses in Vienna raged\r\ninwardly, for Countess Chotek, the “scullery-maid,” as they were in the\r\nhabit of calling her, was being received with Royal honours, and the\r\nrank accorded to her in Berlin was such as would be given to a future\r\nEmpress. Kaiser Wilhelm won a warm friend by this clever manœuvre,\r\nwhich incidentally cost him nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke did not come to Vienna on representative occasions after\r\nthis episode, but he kept in close touch with the Foreign Minister,\r\nCount Aehrenthal, who looked to him for guidance instead of to the\r\nEmperor. The War Minister went to the Archduke’s Bohemian palace when\r\nhe wanted large estimates passed, and induced the Archduke to exert his\r\ninfluence in this direction. Meanwhile the favourite occupation of the\r\nArchduke continued to be gardening, and this taste took him all over\r\nEurope. The Court Chronicle never spoke of the Archduke. An accidental\r\nparagraph in some foreign paper would reveal the fact that he and the\r\nCountess were in Holland, attending sales of bulbs. He even went to\r\nEngland incognito on several occasions to visit far-famed gardens. It\r\nis doubtful, in the light of later events, whether all these journeys\r\nwere connected solely with gardening, although the Archduke was a\r\npassionate horticulturist. Countess Chotek always accompanied her\r\nhusband, and when, in the early spring, he went to Miramare, near\r\nTrieste, or to the fairy-like island of Brioni, she and the children\r\nwent too. The Archduke spent his time in superintending the building of\r\nsmall swift cruisers, in inspecting wireless telegraphic installations\r\non the coast, and in keeping the naval experts employed at high\r\npressure. He was the first Archduke who was interested in the sea, the\r\naged Emperor caring so little for marine affairs that he did not even\r\npossess a naval uniform among the large and miscellaneous collection in\r\nhis wardrobe.\r\n\r\nCountess Chotek, like many not born to the purple, made mistakes of\r\na kind that did not add to her popularity. Her husband had great\r\npossessions, and owned art treasures of inestimable worth, but they\r\nwere far from being a source of revenue. In fact his income was not\r\nsufficient to keep them up properly. His wife had brought him no\r\ndowry. His growing family was a source of expense. Thus ready money\r\nwas a scarcity in the family. Countess Chotek tried to economise on\r\nher personal expenses, instead of leaving it to her stewards, who\r\nunderstood where a woman of that rank can be mean and where she must\r\nbe munificent. She became involved in many discreditable _affaires_\r\nthrough her stinginess. One of these was a dispute with a cabby at\r\nSalzburg. The Countess committed an unheard-of indiscretion--she took\r\na one-horsed cab. No lady, _en toilette_, can ride in a one-horsed\r\ncab in Austria. If really poor she can ride in the electric tramway,\r\nbut for some occult reason the cab is taboo. She must either take\r\na fiacre with a pair of dashing steeds, or a motor-car. Countess\r\nChotek not only hailed a one-horsed cab, when a row of handsome and\r\nwell-fitted fiacres stood by, but refused to pay the fare the cabby\r\ndemanded. He had recognised the lady, and naturally thought that she\r\nwould stand imposition, as ladies of the Imperial family never go\r\nabout unattended, and the only explanation to his unsophisticated mind\r\nwas that the Countess was on clandestine business of some kind, and\r\nshould be blackmailed for it. To his astonishment she marched him off\r\nto the police-station herself. The police condemned the unfortunate\r\ncabby to a fine, but the Countess Sofia was felt to be in the wrong.\r\nWhat had possessed her to ride in an “Einspanner”? An elopement with\r\nthe groom or automobile chauffeur was quite an ordinary incident among\r\nthe aristocracy and speedily forgotten, but such a mistake as going in\r\nthe wrong kind of cab was more than a misdemeanour, it was a lack of\r\n_savoir vivre_ that the country could never forgive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVIENNA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ask an educated, reflecting Austrian under what form of\r\nGovernment he lives, he will reply, “The Emperor of Austria and King\r\nof Hungary is an absolute monarch; we live under a despotism tempered\r\nby carelessness.” And he will laugh flippantly. “So long as one man,\r\nthe Emperor, has the right to decide whether there will be peace or\r\nwar, without appealing to his Ministers, the Constitution is a mere\r\nmockery. We owe the only liberties we enjoy to the slackness in the\r\nadministration of the laws of the realm; we have no rights.” “How is\r\nit that the country has never demanded its rights?” “Those who ask\r\nawkward questions in this country are hanged or exiled.... Those who\r\nwish to remain here keep a still tongue in their heads.... We are\r\ntalking treason now, and there are spies everywhere.” Other Austrians\r\nbelonging to the intellectual class explain that the men in power\r\nencourage frivolity systematically, and provide amusement for the\r\npeople to prevent their thinking or reflecting. Certain it is that\r\nVienna before the war was the chief centre of gaiety in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the sombre shadow cast over the Court, the city lived for\r\namusement. It was the only thing that the Viennese really understood.\r\nIn Advent things are relatively quiet; there is the same round of\r\ngaiety as later in the year, but the toilettes are sombre, and\r\neverything is on a less magnificent scale than in Fasching, the time\r\nbetween the Court Ball--when the Emperor opens the real season--and the\r\nbeginning of Lent. The winter of 1908 was particularly gay. There was\r\nskating all day and dancing all night. Light sleds carried the girls to\r\nballs when the snow had frozen hard and horses, in their spiked shoes,\r\ncould not get any grip on the slippery paving-stones. Others went in\r\nthe electric tramway, which ran even when the temperature was far below\r\nfreezing-point, and the drivers were provided with astrachan masks and\r\ngoggles, to prevent their eyelids freezing to their cheeks. There were\r\nballs every night given by different societies and corporations of all\r\ngrades and degrees, from the artists’ ball to the chimney-sweeps’\r\ndance. No one ever dreamt of staying at home during Fasching. Such\r\ndetails as lack of dress, money or chaperones made no difference. If\r\nyou had no dress you borrowed a domino and went to a masked ball. The\r\nballs often lasted far into the next day, sometimes only closing at\r\nfour in the afternoon. Everyone can dance, and did dance through the\r\nfestive season, except small children, who were learning their steps\r\nat the dancing-school. Many began to dance and skate before they were\r\nfirm on their feet, their parents so dreaded their not being skilled\r\nin the things that “really mattered.” Old men did not stay at home;\r\nthey sat in a favourite café, where a table was reserved for them, ever\r\nsince they had been saluted as “Herr Doctor” for the first time by the\r\nwaiter who judged that they had reached manhood. The rule universally\r\naccepted, and put into practice by rich and poor alike, was: “Enjoy\r\nyourself while you can, you never know what the morrow may bring.” In\r\nthe case of the Viennese it only brought new varieties of enjoyment.\r\nNo considerate employer expected his staff to turn up in full numbers\r\nafter a _redoute_. Sleep was rare in the season. Many young men never\r\nwent to bed at all night after night; they left the ball-room at dawn,\r\ntook an ice-cold dip, and repaired to the next café, where they drank\r\ncup after cup of strong black coffee, to enable them to keep awake\r\nduring office hours. The employer said nothing so long as the work was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAfter the ball it was the rule to visit the music-halls and night\r\ncafés, and this continual gaiety left no time or inclination to discuss\r\npolitics or criticise rulers. Everyone was contented and satisfied\r\nwith things as they were. They made no excuse for their frivolity. In\r\nfact a man who showed no disposition to join in the round of gaiety\r\nimmediately became “suspect.” An officer had more chances of making a\r\ncareer for himself if he were a good dancer and could pirouette his\r\nway into the good graces of the commander’s aged wife than if he spent\r\nhours over maps and plans. His brother officers wondered why he wished\r\nto investigate things.... Was he selling information to Russia?\r\n\r\nAt this epoch winter sports were beginning to become a factor in the\r\nlife of the Austrians. Some girls asked their fathers to give them the\r\nmoney ear-marked for balls to spend on ski and a winter outfit. In\r\nthe middle classes the innovation was not regarded as an advantage.\r\nWinter sports cost more than balls. The girls were inclined to become\r\ntoo emancipated, and their mothers spent anxious hours wondering\r\nwhether they had not taken cold or met with accidents. In the upper\r\nclasses winter sports and dancing were combined. The Austro-Hungarian\r\naristocrat is accustomed to an outdoor life, and the lower classes,\r\ntoo, went ski-ing in the mountains just outside Vienna. The Government,\r\nquick to see that it would be an advantage to have soldiers trained to\r\nuse skis for the army, encouraged winter sports, put on cheap trains\r\nand extra trams to enable the people to go in for it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe army of dressmakers, shoemakers, florists, and others who live by\r\nmanufacturing articles for the ball season naturally disapproved of\r\nwinter sports; but it is doubtful whether the new fashion really made\r\nmuch difference to them, for the ball-rooms seemed as full as ever.\r\n\r\nThere were large numbers of strangers in both Vienna and Budapesth;\r\ncuriously enough they were almost without exception people from within\r\nthe Empire or from the Balkans. Vienna was always the capital of the\r\nBalkans. The women came to shop there, girls were sent to finishing\r\nschools in the capital, and it was a kind of Mecca to which men from\r\nfar-off places in Rumania dreamed of coming once in their lives. The\r\nBalkan kings visited Vienna, and reaped credit with their peoples\r\nfrom having sat side by side with the Emperor, the great stickler for\r\netiquette, the arbiter of rank for the East.\r\n\r\nSuch was Vienna, and such were to a lesser degree the provincial cities\r\nof Austria-Hungary, which all modelled themselves on the capital, when\r\nKaiser Wilhelm of Germany and the heir to the throne, Archduke Francis\r\nFerdinand, decided to embark upon an aggressive policy. The Archduke\r\nfondly believed that the idea originated with himself, and that he was\r\nright in taking advantage of the temporary disablement of the aged\r\nEmperor to strike a blow for his country’s aggrandisement. He did not\r\nsee that he was doing an unwise thing in listening to the counsels of\r\na neighbouring monarch, whose interests were by no means identical\r\nwith those of his own country, and acting on these promptings, without\r\nconsulting the Emperor. Count Aehrenthal, the Foreign Minister, was\r\na creature of the new _régime_, and he took his instructions from\r\nthe coming man. Changes of policy for the Dual Monarchy are usually\r\nannounced at the meeting of the Delegations, an assembly of members\r\nof the Austrian and of the Hungarian Parliaments, who are delegated\r\nby their fellows to represent them at the meeting. The Delegations,\r\nwhich sit in Vienna and in Budapesth alternatively, vote supplies for\r\nall objects common to the two countries, such as the army and navy.\r\nThe small check that the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments can put on\r\ntheir rulers lies here. The members of the Delegations, however, were\r\nmen who had axes to grind and seldom interfered with the programme\r\nannounced by the Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nIt was at a meeting of the Delegations in Vienna, in the winter of\r\n1908, that Baron Aehrenthal announced the fact that Austria-Hungary had\r\nembarked upon an aggressive policy. The days of quiet and tranquillity\r\nwere over; the country intended to join in the march forward. It only\r\nsought commercial expansion, it is true, but it was prepared to face\r\nall and any consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSALONICA\r\n\r\n\r\nAehrenthal sketched a programme of commercial extension in the Near\r\nEast. The first step to be taken was the building of the Sanjak\r\nrailway. The Sanjak is a narrow strip of barren land which was at that\r\nperiod occupied by Austrian troops. Aehrenthal now proposed to build\r\na railway through the Sanjak, with the terminus at Salonica. This\r\nrailway would give Austria-Hungary the control of the Balkans as far\r\nas trade questions were concerned. Salonica would virtually become\r\nAustrian property, not by the force of conquest, but by the natural\r\nsequence of events. It had long been plain that the Turkish Empire was\r\ncrumbling. None knew better than the Austrians that the hour for the\r\nfinal dissolution of the Turkish Empire had come. It therefore behoved\r\nAustria-Hungary to anticipate her rivals and to secure the most\r\nimportant port--Salonica. The building of the Sanjak railway would\r\nhave shortened the route to the East by many hours. Many statesmen in\r\nAustria-Hungary did not approve of the Sanjak project. There was an\r\nalternative and much quicker route over Albania. If a railway could be\r\nbuilt from Durazzo or Vallona across to Salonica, two days could be\r\nsaved on the route to the East. Many statesmen favoured this plan. The\r\nSanjak was a death-trap, they said; the line would run through gullies\r\namong mountains where enemies could command it. Besides the danger of\r\nenemy forces in case of war, the wild bands of half-civilised folk\r\nin the Balkans must be considered too. They might plunder the train\r\nat any time; it would be very easy to hold it up between the steep\r\ndefiles. In Albania there was flat, fertile country that would be\r\nvastly more suited for railway building; it could, besides, be opened\r\nup with advantage. The only trouble with regard to Albania was that\r\nthere was a treaty between Austria and Italy regarding any occupation\r\nof that country. If Austria took northern Albania, as she hoped to do,\r\nItaly was to have the southern part. Vallona, the best harbour on the\r\nAdriatic, lay in the part claimed by Italy.\r\n\r\nThus Austria-Hungary hesitated between two alternative schemes. The\r\nGerman element in Austria was for pushing towards Salonica over the\r\nSanjak. The idea had come from Berlin, and had been carefully suggested\r\nto Austrian diplomatists by the Emperor’s advisers. Aehrenthal\r\nannounced it publicly at the Delegations, and waited to see what effect\r\nhis audacious move would have upon Europe. The Greeks sitting in the\r\ncafé in the Fleischmarkt in Vienna were the first on that memorable\r\nnight of the Delegations’ meeting to catch up the words, “To Salonica.”\r\n“Salonica is Greek,” they said. “If it is wrested from the Turks, it\r\nmust fall to Greece.” Twenty-four hours later Europe said what it\r\nthought of Austria’s plans of expansion. The old Emperor, Francis\r\nJoseph, who had probably listened in a semi-comatose condition, as\r\nhe frequently did, to the report made by his Foreign Minister on the\r\nSanjak railway, summoned him to Schönbrunn in haste. There, in his\r\ncharacteristic way, in language so plain that there was no mistaking\r\nit, and that would have done credit to a Vienna cabby, the Emperor\r\nforbade any thoughts of a forward policy. He had had misfortunes enough\r\nin his long reign, he said. If any innovation was to be made it could\r\nbe undertaken by his successor; for the rest of his life there would\r\nbe quiet. He understood that Russia was aghast at Austria’s plans of\r\naggression, England was furious, and France asking what it all meant.\r\nThe announcement made at the Delegations might be regarded as unspoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARON AEHRENTHAL.]\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the throne,\r\nagreed with the Emperor. He considered that the forward movement in\r\nthe Balkans planned by Aehrenthal was ill-judged. He was aware that\r\nKaiser Wilhelm and the “German” party in Austria desired to open the\r\nroad to the East. The Archduke, however, took a much clearer view of\r\nthe political situation than the Kaiser and his advisers. He grasped\r\nthe very obvious fact that Italy was not a willing member of the Triple\r\nAlliance. She was only waiting for an excuse that would sound at all\r\nplausible to break loose from her bonds. Why the Archduke should be\r\nkeenly aware of a fact that was never even suspected by Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nis not easy to say. Perhaps the intensity of his hatred enabled him to\r\nread the national character aright, for the Archduke hated Italy with\r\na bitter hatred. He possessed estates in Italy, and considered that\r\nthe Italian Courts of Justice had treated him unfairly in a series of\r\nlaw suits he had had about his property there. Moreover, there were\r\ndifferences of temperament between the Austrians and Italians. Francis\r\nFerdinand was essentially a “German” Austrian--that is to say, an\r\nAustrian with leanings towards Prussian methods, who wished to have\r\nthe Austrian army reorganised on Prussian methods. There was something\r\nin the Italian character that roused the Archduke’s anger; both he and\r\nKaiser Wilhelm felt the rage, often manifested by the savage for things\r\nhe cannot understand, at Italy and Italy’s methods. This common dislike\r\nfor Italy which possessed both men was doubtless due to a remarkable\r\nand startling change in the Italian character. During the last twenty\r\nyears the Italians have organised themselves on German lines; the\r\nItalian of to-day has all the efficiency of the Prussian without his\r\ncumbersome methods. When Kaiser Wilhelm went to Italy unexpectedly\r\nto visit his friends there, he found hydroplanes that excelled those\r\nat home moving about in the limpid waters of the Adriatic. He went\r\nto Miramare, swelling with anger. Both he and Francis Ferdinand were\r\nsufficiently intelligent to take in the position at a glance. Italy\r\nwas like a child that had stolen a march upon the world in a night by\r\nattaining to her full stature while the others slept. Both raged at the\r\nunexpected turn things had taken. While Kaiser Wilhelm was anxious\r\nto keep Italy as an ally, because Germany and Austria-Hungary had so\r\nsmall a coast-line, Francis Ferdinand, with much truer insight into\r\nthe interests of his country, said, “Fall upon Italy unexpectedly and\r\ncrush her.” Kaiser Wilhelm realised that the Austro-Hungarian fleet\r\nwould only be of use if it could emerge from the Adriatic. Bottled up\r\nin the inland sea by the Italian fleet it was a negligible quantity.\r\nHe did not comprehend the bitter hatred felt by every Italian for the\r\nancient oppressor, the Austrian. He probably knew little of the ways in\r\nwhich Italians in Austria were persecuted, in spite of the existence\r\nof the Triple Alliance. The Government went about its work in a very\r\nwary manner, and incidents which would have opened his eyes were\r\ncarefully hushed up. It is probable, too, that the Austrians deceived\r\nthe Kaiser as to the attitude of the Italians. Every Austrian knew in\r\nhis heart that there could never be anything but war between the two\r\ncountries. The manner in which they habitually alluded to the Italians\r\nwas sufficient to prove their intense hate. The Italian subjects living\r\nin Austria reciprocated this sentiment in full. Whenever they found an\r\nopportunity of paying back some of the Austrian hate for them, they\r\navailed themselves of the chance. Archduke Francis Ferdinand always\r\nused his influence to prevent Austro-Italians rising to power. He had\r\nofficials in Trieste removed from their posts merely because they were\r\n“Italians.” Their places were taken by Slavs, who regarded the Archduke\r\nas their protector. As a matter of fact, the Slavs were the only people\r\nin Austria-Hungary who respected and liked the heir to the throne.\r\nThe Germans despised him. The Hungarians frankly detested him, and\r\nthe Italians execrated him. The Bohemians, the Croats, and the Serbs,\r\nall Slav races, regarded him as their representative. In the racial\r\ncontests for place and power in Dalmatia, in Istria, the Slavs who\r\nwished to oust the Italians from their places appealed to the Archduke,\r\nand immediately got what they wanted, while the Czechs, who were in\r\ndeadly antagonism with the Germans in Bohemia, had a powerful advocate\r\nin Countess Chotek. When the German officials tried to introduce the\r\nteaching in German instead of the Czech language into elementary\r\nschools in Bohemia in Czech districts, the Archduke stood by them and\r\nprevented any encroachment by the German element.\r\n\r\nThus Emperor Francis Joseph and his heir agreed, although from\r\ndifferent motives, in preventing the plan of the building of the\r\nSanjak railway being pursued. Kaiser Wilhelm, who had taken no part\r\nin the disputes that were raging in Vienna, was glad that the idea\r\nof Austria-Hungary’s embarking on an aggressive policy should be\r\nventilated, but did not wish her to take any course that might lead to\r\nwar either in the Balkans or with Italy. Neither country was prepared\r\nto embark on an aggressive world-war. Kaiser Wilhelm encouraged\r\nAustro-Hungarian statesmen to contemplate a series of wars with poor\r\nand helpless neighbours, such as Italy, Montenegro, and Servia, but\r\nhe was really thinking of executing his projects, of placing Germany\r\n“über alles!” He knew that this idea of aggressive warfare would render\r\nit easier for the German party to obtain the armaments required for\r\nthe coming struggle, while public opinion in the country would become\r\naccustomed to the idea of a policy of expansion. He cared little\r\nthat the Archduke was preparing for a _coup_ upon Italy when he was\r\ncontemplating a blow in the opposite direction. The necessity for\r\nrealising his plans made Kaiser Wilhelm regard all means justifiable,\r\neven the deception of his allies.\r\n\r\nThe storm raised by the Sanjak railway project gradually calmed down,\r\nand Count Aehrenthal, baulked in his plans, retired to the background\r\nto work out fresh plans for Austro-Hungarian aggrandisement; while\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, still sore at the Court Ball incident,\r\nsulked upon his magnificent estate at Konospischt, in Bohemia, where he\r\nsuperintended his wonderful collection of exotic plants and tried to\r\nforget Vienna the dusty, that was so bad for his lungs.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm became increasingly aware that the immediate necessities\r\nof the situation rendered it important to gain Archduke Francis\r\nFerdinand to his side. The Kaiser was painfully conscious that neither\r\nthe aged Emperor nor his heir had any real regard for him. They were\r\ninclined to look upon him as an upstart in many ways. The Kaiser’s\r\nsudden excursions into realms that they regarded as distinctly not\r\nregal annoyed them. What need had the Emperor of Germany to seek\r\ndistinction as a writer of plays? By such tricks he brought down the\r\nwhole level of royalty. All the Habsburgs are eminently dignified, and\r\nKaiser Wilhelm always seemed something of a royal mountebank to them,\r\nwith his strange longings after artistic fame, his childish wish for\r\npopularity--a matter of the most complete indifference to his brother\r\nmonarch in Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nKAISER WILHELM IN VIENNA\r\n\r\n\r\nVienna, startled for an instant by the events connected with the\r\nmeeting of the Austro-Hungarian Delegations, soon sank back again\r\ninto complete apathy as regards foreign politics. The Sanjak railway\r\nwas forgotten and everyone was thinking of how the short time between\r\nEaster and the “Derby,” the final event of the Vienna summer season,\r\nwas to be spent, when news came that Kaiser Wilhelm was about to visit\r\nVienna. He proposed to come to celebrate the aged Emperor’s jubilee\r\nand to bring his whole family with him. The Viennese considered this\r\nmost tactless. Emperor Francis Joseph had lost his only son in a\r\ndrunken brawl, and now his professed friend wished to remind him of\r\nthe fact by bringing a family of handsome young men to accentuate the\r\ncontrast between the lonely old man and the Kaiser in the prime of\r\nlife, surrounded by his six sons. The Kaiser secretly planned another\r\n“honour” for the Emperor. All the Federal Princes were to arrive in\r\nVienna before the Kaiser and to await him on the platform. The Kaiser\r\narranged for them and their retinue to reach Vienna separately and\r\nalmost in secrecy. No receptions were to be given them on arrival. He\r\nonly broke the news to the Emperor privately when all the arrangements\r\nwere complete and some of the Princes already on their way to Vienna.\r\nThe Emperor thereupon lost his temper, which had already been sorely\r\ntried by the proposal to bring so many Imperial Princes. He sent a\r\nmessage to say that his health would not allow of him receiving anyone\r\nexcepting the Kaiser. The Kaiser had to abandon his plan, which was\r\nto have the Emperor of Austria and the German Federal Princes grouped\r\ntogether on the little platform at Penzing, awaiting his arrival “like\r\nthe rising sun,” as the Vienna papers put it, and allow the Emperor to\r\ndo homage to him among his vassals, thus recognising him as overlord of\r\nall the German-speaking peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Press said what it thought of the Kaiser’s overweening ambition,\r\nand he was very surprised. The Austrians were not so stupid as he had\r\nthought. They had grasped his plan to make himself the man of the hour\r\ninstead of leaving the first place to the monarch whose jubilee was\r\nbeing celebrated.\r\n\r\nWilhelm’s fertile, restless brain had hardly abandoned one project\r\nbefore it conceived another. He left his bevy of handsome sons at\r\nhome, but took his only daughter with him to Vienna. The heir to the\r\nAustrian throne, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, had made a morganatic\r\nmarriage; his children could not succeed. Archduke Carl Francis Joseph,\r\nthe son of Archduke Otto, who had lately died a horrible death, would\r\nbe the next heir. Why should Princess Louise not become Empress of\r\nAustria and Queen of Hungary? There was the little difficulty about\r\nreligion, but that could be managed. Louise and her mother, the\r\nEmpress, were informed that they would be allowed to accompany the\r\nKaiser. It is likely that the ladies had but small notice, for Princess\r\nLouise wore skirts that were perfectly appropriate to the palace at\r\nPotsdam, where she ranked as the greatest tomboy of the family, but\r\nthey were decidedly too short and too tight for the Austrian Court,\r\nwhere ample petticoats are _de rigueur_. A tall, thin girl, looking\r\nabsolutely irrepressive, stalked up the platform by her mother’s side.\r\nDistracted ladies-in-waiting had attempted to teach her the Austrian\r\nCourt curtsey--a most complicated manœuvre that takes years to learn.\r\nThey also tried to instil some ideas of the strictness of the Austrian\r\nCourt etiquette into her mind. She was the terror of the palace at\r\nhome; the ladies-in-waiting stood in great awe of the spoilt child.\r\nThey trembled when their turn to attend upon Her Royal Highness came\r\nround. They feared what would happen when she got to Vienna. The change\r\nfrom the free and easy manners of the Berlin Court to the unchangeable\r\nrules and regulations of Vienna was enough to upset a more placid girl.\r\nAll the bowing and smiling upset Princess Louise, whose education had\r\nbeen very “Protestant.” She put out her tongue at one of the stately\r\nArchduchesses--behind her back, it is true, but the incident did not go\r\nunnoticed. She dropped a bouquet that had been presented to her because\r\nthe weight annoyed her. The Empress of Germany looked dismayed at the\r\ndismal failure. She had some idea of the Kaiser’s plans, and was aware\r\nfive minutes after the special train had pulled up on the platform\r\nthat the project had fallen through. Wilhelm, who is not by any means\r\nsensitive, had not marked the by-play. The look on the horrified\r\nface of the Empress should have warned him from committing a further\r\nerror; but he was always quite oblivious to atmospheres. He turned\r\nround and, with a rough shoulder movement that was visible to everyone\r\non the platform, he actually “shoved”--no other word can describe the\r\nmovement--the Princess towards the young Archduke. The Princess, well\r\nused to her father’s abrupt manners, smiled at the young Archduke,\r\nwho rose to the occasion in a manner worthy of the traditions of his\r\nfamily, which is celebrated for its fine manners. But Kaiser Wilhelm’s\r\nmatrimonial plans had failed before they were really made. All the\r\nwomen were against it. The Habsburgs objected to the presence of a\r\nProtestant in their midst even though she might forsake her religion.\r\nThey knew that anything so foreign to themselves could never preside at\r\nthe Court of Vienna. Their opinion was shared by their guest, who hated\r\nthe gloomy Hofburg, and cared but little for Schönbrunn, where the\r\nstrict etiquette rendered the mother of the future heir to the throne a\r\nmere puppet in the hands of attendants, who would not even allow her to\r\neducate or control the destinies of her children. Princess Louise put a\r\nfinal seal upon any possibility of negotiations being renewed by her\r\nvery decided conduct during the subsequent proceedings. Vienna was full\r\nof stories of the strong-mindedness of the Kaiser’s only daughter. It\r\nhad had experience of strong-minded Princesses in the past. It wished\r\nfor nothing more of the same kind. Kaiser Wilhelm had lost.\r\n\r\nBaulked in his matrimonial schemes, he now turned to the political\r\nsituation. Emperor Francis Joseph was irritable. The visit, although on\r\na much smaller scale than had been originally planned, cost him much\r\nmoney, and, though he had been extremely generous in his youth, the\r\nEmperor had become strangely parsimonious in his old age. He grudged\r\nthe great expense that was invariably entailed by the Kaiser’s State\r\nvisits. The programme usually included some expensive outing. Sometimes\r\nfive miles of road had to be improved up to the royal automobile\r\nstandard. At another time Wilhelm would take a fancy to go shooting\r\nafter his stay in Vienna, and could not be induced to accept the\r\nsimple life that was the joy of the Emperor of Austria when among the\r\npeasants. The hunting-box, the whole forest, had to be brought up to\r\nthe standard of an American millionaire. The Habsburgs, whose claim\r\nto rank was too ancient and too secure to need any artificial pomp\r\nto keep it up, rode through the deep forests on small, hardy ponies.\r\nThe Emperor of Germany required a road, and insisted upon its being\r\ncut right through the forest. He was never secure of his position.\r\nBeyond all these minor inconveniences he expected to be treated with\r\nthe utmost ceremony, and considered that it was incumbent upon the\r\nfrail old monarch in Schönbrunn to fetch him at the railway station,\r\nto take him to his rooms along the chilly corridors of Schönbrunn\r\nPalace, and to expose himself, in season and out of season, in order\r\nto magnify the importance of his guest. It was further reported in\r\nVienna that Kaiser Wilhelm, ever penurious, had come to borrow money\r\nfrom the aged Emperor--one of the richest sovereigns in Europe, if,\r\nindeed, not the richest of all. All these things did not endear\r\nEmperor Wilhelm to the Viennese. They showed their feelings by\r\nrefusing to get out the best bunting and by cheering their Emperor\r\nfrantically when alone, and pointedly refraining from any exhibition\r\nof enthusiasm when the visitors passed. The people, too, perhaps, had\r\na true perception of what Kaiser Wilhelm sought, and recognised that\r\nhe was really patronising the old Emperor, suggesting that it was\r\ntime he took a back seat in a dozen insidious ways. Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nhoped Archduke Francis Ferdinand would be easy to manage, but was not\r\nconvinced of this. Emperor Francis Joseph watched the growing intimacy\r\nbetween his heir and the Kaiser with great misgivings. He knew that\r\ntoils were being wound round the Archduke, who believed that he could\r\naccept obligations and not be called upon to pay for them. The aged\r\ndiplomatist at his side knew better. The experience of three-quarters\r\nof a century had taught him the true inwardness of things. It was vain,\r\nhowever, to utter warnings. He was not even discreet. When in a fit of\r\nrage--such as attacks all the Habsburgs who are epileptic--nothing was\r\nsacred. A man who was not able to control himself could not be trusted\r\nwith secrets that might imperil Austria’s relations with Germany. Thus\r\nthings drifted. Germany obtained increasing power in Austrian councils;\r\nthe only man who could lay a restraining hand upon his heir was old and\r\nweary and unwilling for anything that spelt change or unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS IN TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was clear to everyone who followed the course of events in the\r\nNear East that the dissolution of the Turkish Empire was at hand. The\r\nrace towards ruin, that had gone on slowly before the introduction\r\nof the telegraph and telephone, now began to suit its pace to the\r\ntimes. Corruption of every kind was the order of the day in Turkey.\r\nNothing could be obtained without bribery. Every kind of enterprise\r\nwas stopped by the extortions of the tax-gatherer. Any man who was\r\nknown to possess ready money was plundered by corrupt officials. The\r\nsystem of land-tenure prevented the peasants from putting any money\r\ninto improvements. The great mineral wealth in Turkey and the subject\r\nlands could not be touched, for the law said that only the surface of\r\nthe land belonged to the proprietor; all mining rights remained the\r\nproperty of the State. Mining engineers who came to search for hidden\r\nwealth were murdered by the peasants, who feared that the Government\r\nwould confiscate their land. Men who went down to Turkey to do business\r\nalways spoke of the necessity of adopting quite other methods than\r\nelsewhere. Money, even in the case of respectable firms, was not kept\r\nin the bank, where it would fetch interest, but distributed among a\r\nnumber of more or less distant relatives. Thus the stranger had no\r\nmeans of discovering whether his customer could pay or could not pay.\r\nThe latter always had a clear case for the Courts, and could prove\r\nabsolute penury whether the necessity arose in connection with taxation\r\nor with a tiresome customer. At the same time all business there was\r\ndone on the credit system. The European agent, therefore, never dealt\r\ndirect, but depended upon the local agent, who had a profound and\r\nup-to-date knowledge of his customer’s financial standing. The fact\r\nthat no man could be forced to pay made tradesmen very honest, and\r\nthe Turk, even before the revolution, had an excellent reputation for\r\nuprightness throughout South-Eastern Europe. “The Turk is a gentleman;\r\nhe always pays,” they said in Austria and in Hungary. Just as large\r\ntransactions were carried out in the latter countries without the\r\ninterposition of any legal man, and sums running into thousands passed\r\nfrom hand to hand in small notes to avoid the heavy stamp duty, so\r\nthe Turk transacted business without documents, always keeping to his\r\nword. The Austrian and German agent who overran Turkey and dumped his\r\nleast marketable goods upon the people, felt he was dealing with a\r\nkindred soul, but, to avoid all risks, he fixed his prices to allow\r\nfor long waiting, and also to cover any unavoidable bad debts. He had\r\na serious competitor in business in the Balkans, and was gradually\r\nbeing routed from his long-established haunts by the Italian “drummer.”\r\nThe Bohemian textile manufacturers had been accustomed to regard\r\nTurkey and the Balkans as a kind of dumping-ground for bales of goods\r\nthat had not “taken” colour properly and for wares that showed some\r\ndeficiency. The arrival of cases of excellent wares from Milan at about\r\ntwo-thirds of the price of the Austrian article naturally damaged their\r\nmarket very considerably. It is certain that much of the friction\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Italy was due to the growing keenness of\r\ncompetition in trade upon the Balkans, and just at this period it was\r\ngetting very active.\r\n\r\nTurkey hung thus, like an over-ripe pear, the wasps swarming around\r\nher, her Sultan Abdul Hamid committing crimes that cried to heaven,\r\nwhen the news reached Vienna that the Third Army Corps at Salonica\r\nwas marching upon Constantinople. The revolution and the deposition\r\nof Abdul Hamid were accomplished with a celerity that gave rise to\r\nthe suspicion that Austria knew more of the whole affair than she\r\nchose to admit. The Austrian Government made desperate efforts to\r\nkeep the news from getting out until everything was accomplished, and\r\nit is more than probable that the Young Turks were financed by the\r\nAustrian Government. It is equally certain, however, that the Young\r\nTurks chose a moment that suited themselves, and had not consulted\r\nAustria as to details such as dates. Austria had set a vast machine\r\nin motion, and could only stand aghast at the completeness of the\r\nsuccess of the rebels. It was not what she intended. With the opening\r\nof a Turkish Parliament many questions that might have drifted\r\nindefinitely became pressing. The chief of these was the future of\r\nBosnia and Herzegowina. Austria-Hungary had occupied these lands. For\r\nmany years she had carried on a rule that was not pleasing to the\r\npopulation, formed almost exclusively of Serbo-Croats, who wished\r\nto join their Servian neighbours across the frontier. With what the\r\nAustro-Hungarian administrators regarded as singular blindness, they\r\nfelt that they would prefer the very progressive rule of King Peter to\r\nthe retrogressive government of subject-nations by the Central Power.\r\nThe few Mohammedan Albanians in Bosnia were content with the existing\r\nstate of affairs, which differed little from that under Turkish rule.\r\nAs they were merely 3 per cent. of the population, however, they were\r\nof minor importance, although men of prominent position in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Turkish Constitution changed the whole aspect\r\nof affairs as regards Bosnia and Herzegowina. The countries, although\r\noccupied by Austria-Hungary, were still under the suzerainty of Turkey.\r\nThey would have the right to send deputies to represent them at the new\r\nTurkish National Assembly. If this were permitted, Austria felt that it\r\nwould be only a question of time before she was called upon to evacuate\r\nthe annexed lands. Turkey might become regenerate. She would, then\r\nexercise the leading _rôle_ in the Balkans that Austria had reserved\r\nfor herself.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary decided that it was the moment for action. Only\r\none course was open to her. She must proclaim the annexation of\r\nBosnia-Herzegowina. Kaiser Wilhelm was consulted upon the advisability\r\nof this step. He said that the step must be taken without warning. It\r\nmust come upon Europe as a surprise. Other countries had proclaimed\r\nannexations--why not Austria-Hungary?\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand bitterly disapproved of Austria’s attention\r\nbeing turned to the East instead of to Italy. His influence was at\r\na very low ebb at this particular time. Emperor Francis Joseph had\r\nregained his health. It was even thought that the robust old man might\r\noutlive the heir to the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ANNEXATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of the Annexation of Bosnia and Herzegowina in 1908,\r\nwith the evacuation of the Sanjak as a compensation to Turkey, took\r\nEurope by surprise. The general feeling was one of utter astonishment,\r\nthat Austria-Hungary, herself far along the road to bankruptcy, should\r\npresume to annex anything. It is doubtful whether any one realised that\r\nGermany stood firm behind her in her high-handed action. Even if this\r\nwere known vaguely, no one was aware that Germany had been consulted,\r\nhad fathered the plan, and perhaps even conceived it in all its naked\r\nunscrupulousness. When the spasm of astonishment was over there was\r\na loud outcry. Austria-Hungary had “torn up” the Treaty of Berlin in\r\nviolating Article 29. An army, that was ready for the eventualities\r\nthat the country shrewdly suspected might ensue, was hastily thrown\r\nupon the Bosnian frontier, another was pushed up towards Russia.\r\nGermany also despatched a large force to the Russian front. The country\r\nresounded with the noise and confusion of a mobilisation, for, strange\r\nto say, Austria-Hungary, although aware her troops would be required,\r\nhad made no definite preparations. Stories of Bohemian regiments,\r\ndriven into troop trains covered by their officers’ revolvers, ran\r\nlike wildfire through the country. Further reports soon proved that\r\nthe mobilisation was simply organised confusion. Germany heard and\r\nmarked. There could be no war under such conditions. Meanwhile, the\r\nAustro-Hungarian mobilisation was followed by rapid action on the\r\nother frontiers. Russia put troops on her frontiers. Servia, feeling\r\nconcerned for her safety, increased her frontier forces. Count\r\nAehrenthal, besides promising to evacuate the Sanjak, undertook to\r\ncompensate Turkey financially for the loss of her provinces. In all\r\nthese arrangements it must be noted that Turkey was never consulted.\r\nShe had to look on while her territory was taken away, powerless to\r\ndefend her interests. This was a matter of quite secondary interest to\r\nthe Great Powers, who simply demanded to know what were the intentions\r\nof Austria-Hungary. The winter of 1908–09 was spent in negotiation. The\r\nsoldiers, carefully provided with winter clothing, spent the months on\r\nthe chilly frontiers, and pitiful letters of complaint of the severity\r\nof the Galician and Servian climates reached Vienna. These were from\r\nthe common soldiers, whose lot has always been a hard one. They were\r\nsubjected to the severe discipline that prevails in the Prussian army,\r\nbut whereas the Prussian gets his full allowance of food-stuff and\r\nhas the proper clothing for the climate at the end of October, the\r\nAustrian trooper is, as often as not, supplied with ice-making machines\r\nin December and woollen sleeping-sacks in July. New needs that cropped\r\nup at the front were only met long after the cold that made them\r\nindispensable had changed to spring-like warmth and the armies felt the\r\ninconveniences of an inefficient officialdom very severely.\r\n\r\nThe young officers at the front, who were well provided with money,\r\nspent a healthy winter. Ski-ing was one of the chief amusements;\r\nthey brought the sport back to Vienna, where it had previously been\r\nsomething of a novelty. Otherwise the social life of the people was\r\nbut little affected by the diplomatic trouble that was causing such\r\nperturbation at the Ballplatz. There was some complaining at the\r\nscarcity of men. Vienna hostesses had always counted on providing each\r\ngirl with a choice of partners; this year the available men were either\r\ngetting on in life or unduly young, as the mobilisation had swept up\r\nthe rest. Those who remained at home, too, were overworked, and could\r\nnot spend their days in semi-somnolence in the office and their nights\r\nin the whirling activity of the ball-room. It was only a year later,\r\non returning from the annual holiday, that people began to notice\r\nthat prices had gone up. The explanation was simple enough. The army,\r\nafter the unsuccessful mobilisation which had revealed all kinds of\r\ndeficiencies, began to make numerous demands. The guns they had tested\r\nduring the very frequent frontier skirmishes whose history has never\r\nbeen written were useless. Much of the ammunition was counterfeit.\r\nStories of corruption touching even the highest officials were current.\r\nSome great personages were dismissed without the customary decoration,\r\nthe Emperor plainly saying that he would show no mercy to those who had\r\nbetrayed their country. The excuse that they had no idea that a war\r\nwas perhaps pending did not palliate their crime in the eyes of the\r\naged Emperor, who is a soldier _par excellence_ in all that concerns\r\ndiscipline and order.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of many lacunae and “discrepancies” in the service made\r\nAustria-Hungary herself chary of going to war. When the chance of a\r\ncompromise came she was ready to take it. This was the easier for\r\nher, as Germany, who was prepared for a world-war in the month of\r\nOctober, absolutely refused to back Austria-Hungary in an adventurous\r\npolicy in December. The reason was plain. Germany and her Emperor had\r\nbelieved all the reports they had received of Austria’s readiness;\r\nit was only when they saw how the mobilisation hung fire, and\r\nrealised how unwilling her men--especially those belonging to the\r\nsubject races--were to fight, that they saw they had been deceived,\r\nnot intentionally, but by the difference between what the Austrians\r\nbelieved and the actual state of affairs. Kaiser Wilhelm began to\r\nsee for the first time that he could not take the Emperor’s word for\r\nthings; not that the aged man had the faintest intent to deceive\r\nhim, but simply that he lived in a world created by his courtiers,\r\nand existed in the atmosphere prevalent at Courts a century ago. His\r\ncouncillors, old men like himself, never told the Emperor anything\r\nunpleasant. If they believed that he did not wish to hear it, the\r\ntruth was carefully concealed. It is doubtful whether the Emperor ever\r\nknew of the discontent in the ranks of the army.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm had but small difficulty in holding back the politicians\r\nwho sat in Vienna and appreciated his arguments. Modern wars, said the\r\nKaiser, cannot be waged without munitions and money. Austria-Hungary\r\nhad numbers of men, but her munitions were of ancient pattern; her guns\r\nwere not fit for active service. Wealth she possessed in plenty, as\r\nAustria-Hungary is a rich country, but it was not realised. It was all\r\ninvested in lands, machinery, and other plant. Her subjects were not\r\naccustomed to direct taxation to any extent. The military party could\r\nnot grasp these arguments.\r\n\r\nA great nation ought not to stoop to negotiate, it said. Why should\r\nthey hesitate when their army was over two millions strong?\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that during the negotiations no one mentioned the\r\nreally salient point in so many words, nor asked, “By what right had\r\nGermany, through Austria, arrogated to herself the power to disturb the\r\npeace of Europe and to steal a march upon her neighbours in the night?”\r\nNeither country has ever advanced a reason to excuse this action.\r\nThe first cause was doubtless Kaiser Wilhelm. In the plenitude of his\r\narrogance, which made him consider himself beyond all human laws,\r\nhe regarded the rights and wishes of others as entirely negligible\r\nquantities where the greatness of the German Empire, which meant his\r\ngreatness, was concerned. Every German child was taught that Germany\r\nshould be supreme over all. In the schools they learnt that nothing,\r\nnot even truth or justice, could be allowed to interfere with Germany’s\r\ncommercial progress. The young men who stole into Italy or Bohemia as\r\nclerks and took copies of the names of customers for the use of their\r\ncountrymen, were not considered thieves in the usual sense. They were\r\nsimply German patriots; men who had been reared from childhood to\r\nconsider that the old standards had fallen, and a new German philosophy\r\nhad taken its place. This teaching had one object, and one only, the\r\naggrandisement of Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm was at the head of this\r\nmovement. He regarded the other nations as effete and degenerate.\r\nThey had no right to block the way of the Prussians, who were a\r\nreincarnation of the Goths of old, and who would sweep everything\r\nbefore them. Prussians of high standing were not backward in expounding\r\nthis theory. The other German races murmured at the “unscrupulousness”\r\nof the Prussian. They felt that men of this character were dangerous,\r\nand that they ought not to be entrusted with the supreme command in\r\nthe Empire. Austria-Hungary, meanwhile, chafed at the bit that she was\r\nbeginning to feel. After all the delicate questions had been settled\r\nand the terms of the agreement arranged, her statesmen sighed and said:\r\n“This has been a mistake, we ought to have gone to war.”\r\n\r\nStatesmen saw that they had placed themselves too unreservedly in\r\nGermany’s hands. Peace, too, had been preserved by unusual means. When\r\nthings had reached a very critical stage, the aged Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph stemmed the current that was carrying the country towards\r\nwar. He let it be known that he objected to the peace being broken.\r\nHe wished to end his days in tranquillity. Such respect was felt for\r\nthe Emperor that this was sufficient to turn the scale in favour of\r\npeace. Austrian statesmen, however, were encouraged in an irresponsible\r\nfeeling that they might go to great lengths in threatening war\r\nwithout being called upon to back up their threats by action. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian supreme War Lord could save the situation by a word.\r\nGermany could prevent things reaching a climax if the Emperor’s\r\npetition for peace were not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThese ideas were radically wrong. The Emperor tacitly undertook not to\r\nbreak the peace again when he made his appeal. It is certain that he\r\nnever intended to do so. But this should have hampered his statesmen.\r\nIt did not. Instead of feeling that the Emperor’s pledge to Europe laid\r\na responsibility upon them, they, on the contrary, felt that their acts\r\nwere always liable to be disavowed by the monarch, and that they were\r\nnot forced to show the same caution as they would if their decisions\r\nwere final. In the same way, they failed to realise that Germany would\r\ninevitably demand compensation for her protection. The noblemen who\r\nheld the helm in Vienna were not a match for the calculating business\r\nmen who were pursuing a “real” policy at Berlin, and who had little to\r\ndo with ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPRINCE EGON FÜRSTENBERG AND COUNT TCHIRSKY. HOW THE KAISER “WORKED”\r\nVIENNA\r\n\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm had the good sense to keep away from Vienna during\r\nthe time of the annexation crisis. Very few knew the extent of his\r\ninfluence in the Austrian capital, nor had they any idea how it was\r\nexercised. The Kaiser was always well informed of everything that\r\nwas happening in Austria, and obtained his knowledge by attaching\r\npersonages like Max Egon Fürstenberg to his person. The Kaiser never\r\nselected a friend except for the advancement of his own ends. Prince\r\nMax, who had the position of a reigning sovereign, without the work\r\nor responsibilities that were formerly attached to the title and\r\npossessions, had the _entrée_ to all the most exclusive houses in\r\nGermany and Austria-Hungary. Here he shared State secrets that it was\r\ngiven only to very few to know. Kaiser Wilhelm was quick to see the\r\nadvantage of attaching such a man to his side. The Prince was flattered\r\nby the monarch’s notice, and never thought that casual remarks that he\r\nlet fall were treasured up by his Royal host. The German Kaiser and\r\nthe Prince even speculated in stocks and shares together, financed\r\ncompanies, and indulged in business that was quite legitimate for the\r\nwealthy Prince, who could afford to lose heavily, but very dangerous\r\nfor a monarch whose purse was always exhausted.\r\n\r\nPrince Max, who is easy-going and good-humoured, cared little for his\r\nfailures, but Kaiser Wilhelm lost prestige with his people through his\r\nfinancial transactions. Prince Max was very irresponsible in many ways.\r\nLike many other Austrians, he failed to see that his country was on the\r\nedge of a volcano. Things had always settled themselves before, and\r\nthey would again, he thought. It is doubtful whether he realised that\r\nhe was a mere tool in the hands of the Kaiser, and even if he did so,\r\nhis sardonic contempt of life made him indifferent to the unpatriotic\r\n_rôle_ that he was playing in giving away his country’s secrets to\r\nher worst enemy. Intelligent and well-versed in the traditions of\r\nhis family that has produced so many famous men, it is probable that\r\nPrince Max could have saved Austria from falling into the hands of\r\nthe Germans had he realised what was happening. Unfortunately, he was\r\ntoo much occupied in pursuing the latest craze of the moment to think\r\nof serious matters. Under his charming manners he possessed a certain\r\nacumen, but was inclined to think the Germans were guided by the same\r\nmotives as he was himself. The over-civilised, over-polished man of the\r\nworld fell an easy prey to the cold, calculating monarch on the other\r\nside of the frontier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE MAX EGON FÜRSTENBERG.]\r\n\r\nPrince Max Egon Fürstenberg was one type of the Kaiser’s familiars.\r\nCount Tchirsky, the German Ambassador at Vienna, was the prototype of\r\nthe others. The German Ambassador in Vienna was the _doyen_ of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps. Cold-blooded, calculating, deep, he was the very\r\nembodiment of the Kaiser’s ideal politician. Tchirsky did not know\r\nwhat scruples meant, and his many years’ experience of the Court of\r\nVienna enabled him to put his fingers upon every weakness there. He\r\nsaw only the defects and missed much that was fine in the character\r\nof the men with whom he had to deal. They spoke of him as the “Old\r\nSpider” of the Metternichgasse, where he had his palace. He did not\r\nplay a leading _rôle_ in society; visitors to Vienna knew but little\r\nabout him, if indeed they realised his existence at all. He carried\r\non a bitter warfare against the members of the diplomatic body who\r\ntried to oppose the Triple Alliance. His machinations were less openly,\r\nbut none the less fiercely, directed against Italy, the nominal, but\r\nunwilling, ally of the Central Empires. Tchirsky, a man of dark plots,\r\ncontrived to acquire interest in one of the leading Vienna papers. This\r\ninterest developed into the effective control of the organ. He was\r\nable, thus, under the guise of a newspaper attack, to render Vienna\r\nalmost intolerable for any diplomatist whose presence he considered\r\ndetrimental to the welfare of Germany. When the Emperor “conspicuously\r\nturned his back upon the Russian military attaché” at a Court ball, the\r\nfact was recorded with great gusto in Tchirsky’s paper. The attaché,\r\nwho was compromised in a spy case, would have left Vienna by the first\r\ntrain on the morrow in any case. Emperor Francis Joseph was a soldier\r\nand no courtier, and when he turned his back upon a foreigner there was\r\nno mistaking the action. It was done squarely and openly. The record of\r\nthe German-owned Press did not improve the strained relations between\r\nRussia and Austria-Hungary, for the fact that Germany directed the\r\npaper’s policy was an open secret. A pro-English American Ambassador\r\nwas subjected to attacks of a kind that could only be conceived by the\r\nfertile brain of Count Tchirsky. The Ambassador was accused of being\r\nparsimonious, and his personal habits were described with an acrimony\r\nthat showed he had a powerful enemy. The coarseness of the language\r\nused, too, exposed the source; only a Prussian could employ such\r\nmachinations against an enemy. How the Austrians, who prided themselves\r\non their hospitality and their courtesy to strangers, could allow such\r\nan attack to appear can only be explained by the growing helplessness\r\nof their statesmen when confronted by the powerful German. Tchirsky\r\nfurther distinguished himself by making an attack through the Press\r\nupon the wife of the British Ambassador. How far he was responsible for\r\nthe famous Cartwright interview it is difficult to say. The blow, it\r\nwas known at the time, came from Germany. Austrians might have listened\r\nto a private conversation at a table in Marienbad, and put the words\r\nuttered by various members of the British Colony into shape as their\r\nviews upon the Morocco question, but it needed the unscrupulousness\r\nof a German to conceive the plan of putting the pronouncements into\r\nthe mouth of the British Ambassador. The latter was too astonished\r\nby the impertinence of the act to realise what it meant. Indeed, it\r\nis possible that the Ambassador’s indignant denials of ever having\r\nentered into any discussion with the man who claimed to have obtained\r\nthe interview were suppressed like many other items of news and facts.\r\nThe only denial that did appear was late and inadequate. The British,\r\nbound by traditions, never even suspected that German diplomacy could\r\nresort to such means for gaining an advantage. No one realised their\r\nabsolute deadness to all sense of morality. When Count Tchirsky did\r\nsally forth from his chilly palace in Vienna, it was to compass the\r\nundoing of the frivolous Austrians. He would exact the payment of a\r\npledge, given over wine. Bargains, made in the ball-room, were reduced\r\nnext morning to writing, then stored away among the archives at Berlin,\r\nand the carrying out of the conditions--conditions favourable to\r\nGermany and disastrous to Austria--would be exacted with the cruelty\r\nand callousness of a Prussian politician. Had Tchirsky himself hung\r\nback, there were others to egg him on. The ideal condition of a\r\nEurope in which Germany was supreme must be realised. Any remnants of\r\nconscience that Tchirsky might have possessed had long been stifled by\r\nintercourse with his Imperial master, who regarded himself as far above\r\nall moral law. He was the supreme War Lord. His word had established a\r\nnew morality quite different from that generally accepted. The military\r\ntraining enjoyed by almost all Germans made them the more ready to\r\naccept this point of view. Discipline, enforced until the power of\r\nindependent reflection has been lost through want of use, relieved\r\nthem of the necessity of considering the morality of their acts. The\r\nhymns of praise of Germany’s successful policy, sung by philosophers\r\nand by the pastors of religion, who were foremost, as usual, in\r\nadvocating the policy of expediency that Germany might be exalted,\r\nlulled any scruples felt by Tchirsky’s subordinates. He, himself a\r\nsurvival of a former age, was incapable of imagining anything of the\r\nkind. Truth was what the supreme lord decreed to be truth. Honesty was\r\nmerely another word for expediency. The Ambassador was surrounded by\r\na number of men, with no reputation to lose, who brought him news of\r\nevery fresh turn of events in Austria-Hungary. They cared little that\r\nthey were betraying their country to a hard taskmaster. The present\r\nbenefits of a flourishing banking account were ample compensation\r\nfor their treachery. These causes all combined to render Tchirsky\r\nthe least popular man in Vienna. When his name was mentioned, every\r\ntongue was suddenly frozen into silence. Was the inquirer a spy? Did\r\nhe wish to sound the secret feelings of someone present? The Viennese\r\nfelt a distrust that was rather instinctive than realised. It was the\r\npremonition of the closing of the brutal hand of German power upon the\r\ncrowd of gay butterflies on the banks of the Danube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE “GREAT SERVIA” IDEA--SERVIAN ORGANISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Austria-Hungary, with Germany behind her, was discussing the\r\ntearing up of the Treaty of Berlin with the rest of Europe, both Powers\r\nfailed to observe developments that were taking place under their very\r\neyes. The Austro-Hungarian official sent off to Bosnia or Croatia cared\r\nvery little about the people entrusted to him. His one and only idea\r\nwas to scheme and plan until he obtained his move to Vienna. He took no\r\nmeans to detect and watch the conspiracies against the Government that\r\nwere being constantly hatched in the cafés of the town where he lived.\r\nIn a fit of sudden and uncalled-for energy, he would make a search for\r\ncups and saucers decorated with the Serb colours or vindictively punish\r\nthe parents of a small child for permitting her to wear a Serb sash\r\nround her waist, instead of a simple piece of ribbon. This unexpected\r\nactivity naturally raised the wrath of the Serbo-Croats, the more so\r\nbecause really seditious acts frequently escaped notice, or, if the\r\nadministrators knew about them, they avoided taking cognisance of them,\r\nas it meant the opening up of large questions and much trouble with the\r\ncentral authorities in Vienna. Thus the Serbs, who lived under Austrian\r\nor Hungarian rule, were often permitted to go to great lengths without\r\nany interference. The sudden swoops of an enraged magistrate, who took\r\naction rather because the plotters had interfered with his personal\r\nconvenience than because it was really incumbent upon him to do so,\r\nproduced a feeling of insecurity among the subject races. They regarded\r\nthe local governor somewhat in the light of a dangerous but slumbering\r\nbeast, and they prayed that his slumber might continue undisturbed.\r\nSome, however, went the length of trying to twist his tail, when\r\nthey knew that he had been sent to the provinces in disgrace, as was\r\ngenerally the case. If a man had been exiled for more serious offences\r\nthan uncouthness of manner, or a failure to respond to the friendly\r\nadvances of the chief’s elderly wife, and her invitation to shine at\r\nher somewhat monotonous afternoon teas, the Serbs, who were always\r\nwell-posted in the reasons that led to an official being sent to the\r\nprovinces, felt that he was not in a position to injure them without\r\ndamaging himself, and behaved accordingly. The eight million Young\r\nSlavs, as they call themselves, under the dominion of Austria or of\r\nHungary have always been well organised. When one of their number\r\narrives at either Vienna or Budapesth he calls round at his Union.\r\nAlthough he may not know a single word of German or Hungarian, the\r\nsociety find him a job. Accustomed to heavy labour, the Serb or Croat\r\nis much sought after, especially in the lower ranks of service. Time\r\ngoes by, the man-servant or maid-servant has learnt the language and\r\nis firmly established in the household. There is trouble in the home\r\nbecause of the failure of a German tailor to keep his word. The Slav\r\nservant has a relative who is willing to undertake the job, although\r\nit is nearly midnight. He is hastily fetched, and by the advice of his\r\nfriend within the camp fixes his charges a trifle below those asked\r\nby the German. He remains master of the situation, the German being\r\nousted. Gradually the household needs are supplied by Slavs, who carry\r\nout orders promptly and carefully, and have none of the supercilious\r\n“take it or leave it” manner of the German purveyor. The Austrians\r\nalways say “Let one Slav into the house, and they rule the ingoings and\r\noutgoings for the future.”\r\n\r\nThe Slav is always an enigma, which years of close intercourse cannot\r\nsolve. His aspirations, his outlook on life are a sealed book to the\r\nWest European. The all-pervading and very distinct impression which\r\nremains is that the Slavs have very distinct national aims, which they\r\nare prepared to pursue with an utter persistence and ruthlessness, of\r\nwhich no other peoples are capable.\r\n\r\nJust at this period the Young Slavs within the Austro-Hungarian realm\r\nwere making a determined effort for liberation. They felt, and felt\r\njustly, that they were oppressed. They thirsted for education and\r\npaid large taxes to secure that same education in order to enable\r\ntheir children to take their places as equals with the dominant races.\r\nAustria and Hungary both dreaded the rise of the Slavs, and restricted\r\ntheir education as much as possible, devoting the funds voted for the\r\npurpose to other objects.\r\n\r\nThings were so bad in this respect that a commission was sent over from\r\nthe States to ascertain how it could be possible at this date in the\r\ncivilisation of the world that such a large proportion of emigrants to\r\nAmerica should be illiterate. In some provinces it appeared from the\r\nGovernment statistics that 69 per cent. of the annual recruits could\r\nneither write nor read. The lack of education was most felt among\r\nthe Serbs, Croats, Poles and Little Russians. The Slavs, who possess\r\nan uncommon amount of commonsense, felt that this withholding of\r\neducation was immoral, and that it served some deep ulterior purpose.\r\nThe Bohemians, who inhabited a rich manufacturing district, by force\r\nof much agitation, were able to enforce their demands for education.\r\nThe Poles were miserably neglected, their representatives who attended\r\nthe Vienna Parliament were fêted and made much of, and, aristocrats\r\nthemselves for the most part, they were easily persuaded to forget the\r\nwrongs of their people at home. In the Bukowina the people were on a\r\nlow level, and hardly realised their position. In Croatia, Dalmatia,\r\nand especially in Bosnia, things were different. Italy was close by,\r\nand the Slavs learnt how things were managed in that very progressive\r\nand modern State. Servia and Montenegro were governed on lines that\r\ncontented the peoples there, and the Serbs across the frontier felt\r\nthat they would be better under the rule of King Peter than subject to\r\na governor who was so far from the centre that he could practically\r\ndeal with them as he pleased. It was seldom that the governor really\r\nunderstood the vernacular. Being entirely German in his sympathies, he\r\nnaturally felt no interest in the Slav aspirations, except a desire\r\nto crush them. While Vienna was using up her strength in arguing with\r\nEurope, the Slavs considered that their opportunity had come for the\r\nestablishment of a vast Slav Empire, consisting of all the countries\r\ninhabited by Slavs in Southern Austria and Hungary, which was to be\r\nplaced under the rule of the King of Servia.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a union between Montenegro and Servia, for the\r\nestablishment of a common customs tariff, a common army, and for the\r\npursuance of a common foreign policy, were being carried on. Servia\r\nhoped to extend her territory to the sea. Whether she thought to\r\nincorporate the Slavs of Austria and Hungary among her people is\r\ndifficult to say, but she, like the rest of South-Eastern Europe, was\r\naware that Austria-Hungary was rotten to the core. It must in the near\r\nfuture follow Turkey and share its fate. As events move much more\r\nquickly to-day in the epoch of telegrams and railways than they did\r\nin the period of coaches and couriers, a much more rapid dissolution\r\nof the Empire was to be expected than in the case of Turkey that\r\nhad been tottering for centuries. While the Austrian and Hungarian\r\nSlavs were looking to King Peter to deliver them from Austrian and\r\nHungarian tyranny, Austria was intriguing, and encouraging the Serbs\r\nin Servia to rebel. She had as little success with the Serbs as\r\nwith the Italians across the Italian frontier, as both peoples are\r\nardently patriotic, and even the poorest scorned Austrian gold. The\r\ndetermination of the Young Slavs to live under the rule of a monarch\r\nof their own race became strengthened at every fresh proof of the\r\neffeteness of Austro-Hungarian rule. Themselves strong and virile,\r\nthey felt that they required administrators who could deal with the\r\nproblems that came to them for settlement in the rough-and-ready manner\r\npeculiar to the other side of the border; they had always completely\r\nmisunderstood the shelving of petitions, the cumbersome multiplication\r\nof documents, peculiar to Austro-Hungarian officialdom. Rapid justice,\r\neven if less correct in the matter of form, was preferable, they felt,\r\nto the long and unprofitable dilatoriness of the proceedings under an\r\nadministration more especially careless in dealings with things that\r\nconcerned people living far from the capital.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary heard but little of the growing discontent in her\r\noutlying provinces. Assassinations and attempts on the lives of\r\nadministrators multiplied, but the rulers in Vienna, busy with things\r\nnearer home, simply suggested “that a heavier weight should be placed\r\nupon the safety-valve.” After an outrage some few ringleaders were\r\nhanged, half a dozen newspapers suppressed, and then the incident was\r\nput away with other events of grave portent, signs of the times which,\r\nhowever, were not allowed to disturb the gaiety of the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nALBANIA AND MACEDONIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand the complete indifference with which\r\nthe growth of the Great Servian idea was regarded in Vienna. Eight\r\nmillion Serbo-Croats under Austro-Hungarian rule were eager to join\r\nforces with their brothers across the frontier, five million Serbs\r\nand Montenegrins. Whether the indifference manifested at Vienna was\r\nowing to the attitude of supercilious contempt of what was going on\r\naround them which was generally adopted by Austro-German officials,\r\nor whether they were really ignorant of the extent of the movement,\r\nit is difficult to say. It is possible that politicians, who did\r\nreflect upon the very evident increase of disaffection in the South,\r\nmerely regarded it as an indication that the small Germano-Austrian\r\nand Magyar minorities must throw in their lot with Germany. Certainly\r\nthe relative numbers of Germans and Czechs, of Maygars and Serbs were\r\nmost alarming. Officials in high places naturally judged the position\r\nmore accurately than could the man in the street, because the published\r\nstatistics giving their relative numbers of Germano-Austrians and\r\nCzechs, of Serbo-Croats and Magyars, were always manipulated to such an\r\nextent that they were quite useless for scientific purposes. Another\r\nset of correct figures was kept for the purposes of administration.\r\nWith an insolent disregard of her complete lack of success in ruling\r\nthe Serbo-Croats, Austria-Hungary not only added more millions to her\r\nrealm by annexing Bosnia and Herzegowina, but she now embarked on new\r\nschemes of annexation and colonisation.\r\n\r\nNew Turkey had less vitality than the old ruin that had just crumbled\r\nto pieces. The Young Turks, when asked why they had not seized their\r\nopportunity of securing the benefits they so much desired, which had\r\nbeen within their grasp, said sadly that appearances were deceptive.\r\nThere had never been a chance of regeneration for the country. The\r\nsame power which had promoted the revolution had corrupted the new\r\nParliament--German money. Austrian interference had rendered them mere\r\npuppets in the hands of unscrupulous Germans. They had not realised\r\nthis until too late. They had merely delivered their country over to\r\na worse foe than Abdul Hamid, who, whatever his vices and faults might\r\nhave been, acted in his own interests and in the interests of Turkey.\r\nGermany had encouraged the revolution merely to precipitate the final\r\nruin of Turkey. She now thought that the moment for dissolution could\r\nnot be postponed. Austria, acting for her, proclaimed the fact of\r\nTurkey’s disintegration upon the housetops, and suggested that Albania\r\nand Macedonia should be made autonomous. The proposal sounded fair\r\nand just. Everyone knew that the Macedonians had been fighting for\r\nliberty for centuries. The claims of Albania were not so clear. Those\r\nwho lived close to the Balkans understood what the news of outrages\r\nand massacres was worth. Outrages and massacres were certainly common\r\nenough in both Macedonia and Albania, but news from the Balkans never\r\npenetrates to Mid-Europe, unless it is to the advantage of some Great\r\nPower that it should do so. Indeed, events of great importance happened\r\nin the outlying provinces of Austria-Hungary without the rest of\r\nEurope knowing anything about them. Rebellious Poles were shot down in\r\nhundreds by dragoons in broad daylight. Even in Vienna and Budapesth\r\nthe soldiers dealt with the crowd in the most brutal manner, killing\r\nand wounding unarmed citizens. Official telegrams would report riots,\r\nmentioning a small number of injured and one killed. Thus it may be\r\nunderstood that news from the Balkans, especially when it dealt with\r\noutrages, was always political in its aim, and always biassed. Just at\r\nthis time Albanian massacres began to be very frequent. Now persons\r\nacquainted with Albanians will always be very sceptical as to these\r\nsame massacres. The Mohammedan Albanian, a member of the predominant\r\nrace in the country, is very frequently a highly polished gentleman.\r\nHe speaks French very fluently of the variety spoken at Constantinople\r\nand throughout the Balkans. Few Europeans can beat him in accuracy;\r\nnone come anywhere near him in fluency, the result of much practice.\r\nHe can neither read nor write, but having been partially educated at\r\nConstantinople, he possesses great culture. Underneath is the wild man\r\nof the highlands, who carries on blood feuds with the neighbouring\r\ntribes, and never hesitates to slay a Turkish tax-gatherer at sight.\r\n“Turkey,” say the Serbs, “tried to tax the Albanians for thousands\r\nof years; she has never succeeded in obtaining a single _para_; she\r\ncommuted the taxation for soldiers, and all the finest Turkish\r\nsoldiers are really Albanians.” This was literally true. Practically\r\nall the handsome Turkish guards are Albanians, and they have won Turkey\r\nher reputation for producing splendid soldiers. The Albanian, too,\r\nis an excellent merchant; he can only be compared with the Italian\r\nfor financial capacity. He naturally filled many of the important\r\nposts under Abdul Hamid. Albanians seldom marry into alien races.\r\nAfter twenty years spent in Constantinople, the Albanian returns\r\nhome to settle upon his small farm, if he cannot establish himself\r\nupon the ancestral property. It is often a mere slip of barren land\r\nupon the hillside, where ploughing must be done by hand, because no\r\nhorse or mule could keep a foothold on the steep slant. He purchases\r\nthe property and founds a family. It is clear that a man of this\r\ndisposition, with influence at Constantinople, would not allow his\r\npeople to be massacred unavenged. If the cunning tax-gatherer dare\r\nnot approach the mountains, even when guarded by a troop of Turkish\r\nsoldiers, it is unlikely that the somewhat effete men who compose the\r\nreal Turkish army would venture up country merely for the sake of\r\nmassacring odd Albanians. The latter seldom congregate in cities, but\r\nare scattered far and wide throughout a roadless country. The Turks\r\nsometimes sent large and well-equipped expeditions to Albania, to\r\navenge the killing of a governor or some other important functionary\r\nwho was misguided enough to venture into their midst. These expeditions\r\nburnt out villages and killed every inhabitant they could lay hands on\r\nin the approved Turkish fashion. But the result of such expeditions\r\nwas not great. The Albanians, who have an excellent system of\r\ncouriers, spread the news of any attempt against their liberties. The\r\ninhabitants took to the mountains and slaughtered a large proportion\r\nof the invading force from behind rocks, and from almost inaccessible\r\nfastnesses among the mountains. But such expeditions, owing to their\r\ncost in men and arms, were very rare. Owing to the jealousies of\r\nTurkey, Austria, and Italy, the Albanian never lacked weapons. One\r\nnation or the other was always ready to supply him with munitions to\r\ncarry on his nefarious plans against the others.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Albanian is perhaps a trifle fiercer than his Mohammedan\r\nbrother. He has not enjoyed the advantages of a long stay in\r\nConstantinople. He knows the Serb language, having learnt it from the\r\nwild mountain Serbs on the other side of the frontier. He is quite\r\nsavage, like his neighbours. There is little to choose between the\r\nMiridites and Malissores on the Albanian side of the border, and the\r\nMontenegrins and Serbs across the mountains. The Albanian, in some\r\ncases, however, has had a chance of improving his general education.\r\nHe is an inveterate emigrant. There is a large standing colony of\r\nAlbanians in the United States. In Boston alone there are many\r\nthousands. They are young men, almost exclusively, for the Albanian\r\ndoes not take his womenfolk with him, nor does he settle beyond the\r\nocean. He simply goes abroad to make his fortune. He works without\r\nceasing in the great factories of the States, he denies himself every\r\nkind of pleasure, and eats the commonest food, prepared in a large\r\neating-house for members of his race, and saves continually. Existence,\r\nsupported upon a handful of maize or macaroni, cannot be interesting,\r\nbut he is willing to undergo the time of stress for the purpose of\r\ndeveloping into a landed peasant-proprietor in his own land. He is then\r\npermitted to marry, and becomes the head of the family. His brothers\r\nwho have tilled the land at home are denied the privilege of marriage\r\nuntil much later on in life, or maybe never reach a state of affluence\r\nthat permits them to enter wedlock at all.\r\n\r\nIt gives a foreigner something of a shock to hear a handsome brigand\r\nfresh from his mountains speaking perfect Boston English, and using\r\nwith the utmost assurance words that have been buried in oblivion since\r\nthe time of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Albanian of to-day. Reports of massacres carefully spread\r\nfrom the Central News Bureau, under German influence, at Salonica, were\r\nnot accepted as facts in the south-eastern part of Europe. Italians,\r\nacquainted with the scene of action, reckoned up that if the reports\r\nissued in the Austrian papers were true, every Albanian must have\r\nbeen massacred on ten different occasions, besides being tortured and\r\nwounded times without number.\r\n\r\nThe interest shown by Austria-Hungary and Germany in the welfare\r\nof Albania was much deeper than that shown in Macedonia, because\r\nAlbania commanded the Adriatic. Italy took an equally great interest\r\nin Albania, and to prevent any mistake about the final fate of the\r\ncountry, began colonising it, planting her traders all along the\r\ncoast. There was a treaty between Austria and Italy, to the effect\r\nthat neither country should make any move in regard to Albania without\r\nconsulting the other. Neither considered that the spirit of the\r\nagreement prevented the carrying on of intrigue. The Albanian, skilled\r\nin the diplomacy of the East, pitted one set of agents against another,\r\nand stored up rifles of the newest pattern for the carrying out of his\r\nprivate vendettas and the repulsing of any attempt to civilise him.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of Albania when Austria-Hungary thought good\r\nto duplicate her annexation trick. She proclaimed the autonomy of\r\nAlbania and Macedonia overnight, without consulting the other Powers.\r\nHer idea of autonomy was rule under a German prince, who would use his\r\ninfluence for his Fatherland. Austria meant to make another Bulgaria of\r\nMacedonia, and another Rumania of Albania. Italy protested against this\r\narrangement. She objected to the ever-handy German princes being placed\r\non thrones near the sea-coast. Servia and Montenegro, too, were afraid\r\nof German influence being extended in Albania, and did their best to\r\nfoment trouble there. Servia had long regarded the route over Albania\r\nas her one chance of an outlet to the sea, and saw herself deprived\r\nof “her little window into the Adriatic” by the plan that would make\r\nAlbania a sphere of Austro-German influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE BALKAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany and Austria were considering how the Turkish Empire could be\r\nliquidated in a manner to secure the greatest advantage to themselves,\r\nand in their egoistical view somewhat neglected the other factors in\r\nthe situation. Russia had great interests in the Balkans. Italy was\r\nlooking towards the time when her surplus population could be sent\r\nthere to colonise the rich lands that had been so neglected under the\r\nrule of the Turks. The third factor--which Germany and Austria did not\r\nthink worth considering at all--was the Balkan peoples themselves.\r\nUnder Russian protection, they had conceived a grand scheme. A Balkan\r\nLeague was formed. Bulgaria, Servia, Greece and Montenegro forgot\r\nall their disputes and became allies. Their Ministers drew a map of\r\nthe Balkans, apportioning out among themselves the provinces that\r\nthen belonged to Turkey, the distribution being made according to the\r\nnationality of the peoples who inhabited each district. Each country,\r\nthey considered, was to be ruled over by a king of its own nationality,\r\nif possible. All the Bulgars in Macedonia were to be united under the\r\nsceptre of King Ferdinand. The Kingdom of Servia was to stretch to the\r\nAdriatic, Albania was to be divided between Montenegro and Servia.\r\nBoth countries would then have fine ports in the Adriatic. Greece was\r\nto extend her coastline considerably. She was to have those parts of\r\nMacedonia and of Albania that were inhabited by Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian people were the soul of this movement for liberation.\r\nKing Ferdinand, who was always a German at heart, and who ruthlessly\r\nbetrayed his adopted country to serve German interests, was probably\r\ndragged into the scheme by his enthusiastic people very much against\r\nhis will. The Bulgars who lived in Austria and in Hungary boldly said\r\nthat they had been preparing for the war against Turkey for forty\r\nyears. “Every effort has been made by great and small for nearly half\r\na century to throw off the Turkish yoke, and at last we shall do it,”\r\nthey said. And this in spite of the Germanophile King. Bulgarian\r\ngardeners, who are employed all over Eastern Europe because of their\r\nextraordinary skill, came to Hungary, toiled through a lifetime, saving\r\nevery possible penny of their earnings to return home with money for\r\nthe war fund. Their hate of the Turks was intense. They wished to free\r\ntheir fellow Bulgars, who were oppressed by the Turkish tax-gatherers,\r\nand who had very little benefit in return for years of toil spent in\r\ncultivating tobacco-fields. While the Bulgars themselves were working\r\nfor an ideal, Ferdinand and his Ministers wished to take possession of\r\nthe rich tobacco-lands in Macedonia, which brought large revenues to\r\nthe Turkish State. The Bulgars’ great enthusiasm was only damped by a\r\nprofound mistrust of their Prince. They knew that Ferdinand ranked as\r\none of the best diplomatists in Europe, and were proud to have so rich\r\na man upon their throne. But they felt that in the difficult enterprise\r\nthey were about to undertake a monarch with more honesty of purpose\r\nwould have been fitter to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Balkan League was formed with the ostensible purpose of\r\nfreeing Balkan lands from Turkish rule, the discontent in the Balkans\r\nwas due to other causes. Montenegro had no outlet to the sea that was\r\nsuitable or big enough for her needs. If she had possessed Cattaro,\r\none of the many excellent ports on the Hungarian coast, Servian goods\r\ncould have been exported as well as Montenegrin products. It was\r\nAustria-Hungary who always opposed this. If she had allowed the Serbs\r\nto send their agricultural products to other parts of Europe beyond\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian frontier all would have been well. There was a\r\nshortage of meat in Germany and Italy, as well as in Austria itself.\r\nBut Austria, to please the Hungarian agrarians, interfered with all\r\nexport trade into Austria or Germany, and thus made the Slavs on the\r\nBalkans determined to find an outlet to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan war was really the curtain-raiser to the Great War. The King\r\nof Montenegro was the first to begin. His troops were mobilised in\r\ntwenty-four hours. The Balkan League had advised him that the war was\r\nabout to begin, but it is more than possible that his very precipitate\r\naction hastened a war that was not perhaps inevitable. The news that\r\nMontenegro had mobilised was not taken seriously in Vienna. A story\r\nwent the round of the cafés that it was all a put-up affair. Nikita,\r\nthey said, had been engaged by Pathé Frères, he was to receive a\r\nlarge sum of money for the films of a real mobilisation, and perhaps a\r\nminiature battle with the Turks thrown in. Very soon, however, it was\r\nseen that the Balkans were in deadly earnest. The Austrians, who knew\r\nsomething of the fighting qualities of the Turks, never doubted that\r\nthey would have a complete walkover. The Turks had money, they had\r\narms. The Balkan peoples had none. Austria was perhaps not aware that\r\nGermany had supplied Bulgaria with large stores of guns and ammunition.\r\nThe poor Balkan people had paid very dearly for the antique patterns,\r\nand been swindled most atrociously over the whole deal. The sights of\r\nthe guns were wrong, and the Bulgarian gunners had had no instruction\r\nin their work.\r\n\r\nServia was supplied with French guns, and French gunners accompanied\r\nthe consignments to their destination, and taught the Serbs how to\r\nmanage the complicated weapons. Montenegro was well supplied with\r\nammunition. Where did it come from? The wild mountain tribes, both in\r\nMontenegro and in Albania, were always supplied with the latest thing\r\nin rifles and full supplies of ammunition. They had been disarmed time\r\nand time again, but they merely surrendered ancient heirlooms, rifles\r\nthat served their grandfathers or great grandfathers. The good weapons\r\nwere hidden in caves in the mountains, or buried until better times\r\ncame, and they could carry them again.\r\n\r\nThe first Balkan war began, and the unexpected happened. Turkish\r\ntroops were routed by the Bulgars, who fought with a courage and a\r\ndetermination that won them the respect of Europe. The Bulgars pushed\r\non to Adrianople, but could not take it because the German guns were\r\nuseless. The Bulgars raged against the Germans. Did the Germans simply\r\nlook upon them as savages who could be supplied with inferior goods,\r\nor had they supplied the guns knowing that they would be used against\r\nthe Turks? Neither Germany nor Austria wished the Turks to be defeated.\r\nThey were pleased that the Balkan peoples should be weakened by\r\nfighting among themselves, but were very surprised and disappointed at\r\nthe course taken by the war and the total defeat of Turkey.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, the Balkan peoples began dividing up the\r\nspoils. Austria, with Germany behind her, interfered in the settlement.\r\nShe would not allow Servia to have the territory she had conquered in\r\nAlbania, or any outlet to the sea. Servia thereupon demanded part of\r\nMacedonia, instead of the territory assigned her by the preliminary\r\nagreement. Ferdinand of Bulgaria was inclined to yield this, but\r\nAustria encouraged him to stand firm, promising to help him if he\r\ncould not defeat that handful of savages, the Serbs. Russia, who had\r\nencouraged the formation of the Balkan League, saw that if the States\r\nbegan fighting among themselves, they would lose all their gains, and\r\npublicly advised the Balkan kings to refrain from fighting and to be\r\nsatisfied with the land they had conquered. The States had enlarged\r\ntheir borders considerably; it would take years to consolidate them.\r\nRussia counselled them to attend to that business first, and then\r\nthink of further conquests. This counsel did not please Bulgaria. King\r\nFerdinand wired to Vienna for advice. Austria-Hungary and Germany\r\nsaw their chance. The Balkan peoples were disunited. They must be\r\nencouraged to fight among themselves. Austria, acting without Germany,\r\ndespatched a two-thousand word telegram to Ferdinand of Bulgaria. It\r\npromised an attack upon Servia from behind, while she was engaged\r\nwith Bulgaria in front. The preparations made just before an army is\r\nmobilised were hastily put through. Men were warned for active service,\r\nand every preparation made for starting a Balkan campaign. When\r\neverything was ready Austria-Hungary notified her allies. It was soon\r\napparent that they refused to join in the campaign, or even to stand by\r\ntheir ally.\r\n\r\nItaly--as was discovered long after--said that the Triple Alliance was\r\ndefensive, and not offensive. She not only refused to aid Austria, but\r\nwould not promise to remain neutral during the expedition. Germany,\r\nseeing that an Austrian expedition to the Balkans meant trouble with\r\nItaly, persuaded Austria to back out of her promise. Germany was not\r\nsorry that Austrian prestige should suffer. She did everything she\r\ncould to discredit her ally in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nWhen Bulgaria had been completely beaten by her despised neighbour,\r\nSerbia, Rumania fell upon her from behind and annexed a large piece\r\nof territory. Ferdinand’s treachery to his allies had met with the\r\ndeserved reward. The Kaiser had no pity for him, and was not slow to\r\npoint out that whoever relied upon Austria was deceived. Had Ferdinand\r\napplied to Berlin, instead of to Vienna, things would have gone\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nFerdinand, broken, aged, a politician who has lost his game, a King\r\nbereft of territory, a soldier who had been defeated, fled from\r\nSofia to Vienna. At last he was forced to leave even that refuge. If\r\nAustria-Hungary had meant to leave him to unravel the tangled skein\r\nshe had encouraged him to weave, she should have told him so before,\r\nand not abandoned him in the darkest hour of his life. The Emperor\r\nfelt the justice of the reproaches that Ferdinand made him. He wished\r\nto be rid of the troublesome monarch. The Vienna Press was let loose\r\nupon Ferdinand. Stories to his discredit were circulated everywhere.\r\nWhile his wife comforted the wounded, said the leading papers, he\r\nstayed in the capital because he was afraid to return. He spent his\r\ntime in frivolity, joking with ballet girls behind the scenes, while\r\nhis consort was purchasing artificial limbs for the maimed from the\r\nmoney that should have been devoted to her own personal uses. Ferdinand\r\nsoon discovered that in Vienna, as elsewhere, nothing succeeds like\r\nsuccess, and that failures are not wanted, either there or in other\r\nforeign countries. He crept back to his summer palace, had the guards\r\ndoubled, and lived in fear and trembling. His throne was so shaken that\r\nit seemed very doubtful whether it would regain its equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn disavowing Ferdinand Austria-Hungary lost her influence in the\r\nBalkans.\r\n\r\nAt this period Russia and Italy, the new Balkan Powers, were in the\r\nascendant. Austria advised Ferdinand to wait his time, when Bulgaria\r\nwould be able to take vengeance upon her neighbours, and reap the\r\nreward of her treachery. Ferdinand, thoroughly tired of promises, and\r\nbitterly regretting his treachery to his allies, which had brought him\r\nthe reward he so richly deserved, thanked fate that his wife and sons\r\nwere popular in the country, and that he could leave for his Hungarian\r\nestates. He was sure that they could look after the interests of the\r\ndynasty much better during his absence than when he was there, only\r\nable to make lame explanations of his conduct in the past and his\r\ninexplicable quarrel with the other Balkan States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nKING FERDINAND OF BULGARIA, THE VAINEST MAN IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand was an interesting study as he crept away from Vienna,\r\nall his hopes bankrupt, his people’s future compromised. The people\r\nthere considered him almost one of themselves, for the Coburgs had\r\nalways lived in Vienna. Prince Philip had a palace that commanded a\r\nfine view right across the Ringstrasse. His brother Ferdinand lived\r\nthere when he came to Vienna, and was thus able to come to and fro,\r\n_incognito_, whenever he pleased. The rest of Europe had no idea of\r\nthe frequency of his visits to the capital. Perhaps it was only the\r\ntheatre-managers who really were aware how often he was present in a\r\ncapital where everyone was at liberty to come and go, unmolested by the\r\ncrowd, unless he came as a monarch in state, when the Viennese were\r\nthe first to acclaim one of their children “who had gone so far in the\r\nworld,” as they expressed it. The general feeling in the city was\r\nthat Ferdinand was a great artist in diplomacy, perhaps the greatest\r\nin Europe. In the capital of Austria he met many statesmen who came\r\nthere--to the “very edge of civilisation,” as they put it--to confer\r\nupon the problems that then troubled Europe. Kaiser Wilhelm frequently\r\nrushed through to Vienna in his automobile, without warning, and\r\ntook part in a short discussion of the situation, at which Ferdinand\r\nassisted on many occasions. Kaiser Wilhelm, with his usual astuteness,\r\nunderstood how to manage Ferdinand. He did not need money; that was a\r\ngreat relief to the Kaiser, who was invariably short of it himself.\r\nThe Coburg family fortune was sufficient to provide for all his\r\nprivate wants on a liberal scale. There is not the slightest doubt\r\nthat Ferdinand would have lost his throne long before had he been\r\nforced to ask his subjects for money to supply his personal needs.\r\nHis independence in this respect placed him on a footing with the\r\nproudest monarchs in Europe. Kaiser Wilhelm, prodigal of things that\r\ncost him nothing, was able to lavish his gifts of wondering admiration\r\nupon the King of Bulgaria. He tactfully praised qualities that his\r\nfriends imagined they possessed, and his delicate flattery of his\r\nbest “democratic” manner, that seemed to say there was no difference\r\nin rank at all between the king of a Balkan State and the Emperor of\r\nGermany, made Ferdinand a puppet in his hands. Wilhelm flattered him\r\ninto seeing things with his eyes, and mesmerised the dazzled monarch,\r\nwho had been a poor lieutenant, into thinking that he was really being\r\ntaken into the confidence of German statesmen and allowed to read\r\nthe secret thoughts of the great War Lord himself. The other Balkan\r\nsovereigns, who had a clearer idea of the reality of things, could\r\nnot have been gulled so easily. They would have realised that there\r\nwas a reason for this preference, shown only of recent years, for a\r\nman who commanded the route to Constantinople. Ferdinand, student of\r\npolitical history, a consummate diplomatist, was, nevertheless, blinded\r\nby the Kaiser, who appeared so simple--indeed, almost childlike--in\r\nhis aims, and so far removed from the world of diplomatists to which\r\nFerdinand belonged. This apparent simplicity of character, which has\r\npuzzled so many, is due to a warped mind. Kaiser Wilhelm has long\r\nconsidered that nothing mattered compared with the glorification of\r\nGermany. The Almighty he considered had entrusted him with the task\r\nof elevating the German nation. It was the supreme people of the\r\nearth. It ought to be raised to a position which would make all other\r\npeople subservient to it, and the humble instrument for this work was\r\nhimself. He thus considered himself at liberty to break any law that\r\nstood in his way, and, being a firm believer in the creed that the\r\nend justifies the means, he was able to impress even people of great\r\nand unusual acumen with a sense of his probity. King Ferdinand would\r\nnot trust the King of Montenegro, although Nikita was an open-handed,\r\nopen-hearted old mountaineer. He was, however, quite willing to accept\r\nKaiser Wilhelm’s estimate of himself as a man with a single aim that\r\nmust be accomplished at any cost. The King of Bulgaria prided himself\r\nupon being the “Little Czar” of the Balkans, and aped the great Russian\r\nCzar in many ways. He was naturally encouraged in this by Germany. His\r\ninsatiate vanity prevented him from seeing that the delicate flattery\r\npoured into his ears by German diplomatists was merely dictated by\r\nself-interest. They wished to detach him from Austria and secure the\r\nallegiance of Bulgaria for Germany, to the detriment of Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph and his prestige among the Balkan peoples. Ferdinand would\r\nswallow any bait, walk into any trap, if an appeal to his vanity\r\nwere made. Order after order was bestowed upon him; he received so many\r\ndecorations that his uniform shone like a coat of mail with the small\r\nmedals that are worn instead of the large originals. When he made his\r\ntriumphal progress to Vienna for the first time in his new capacity\r\nas king, his tunic was one mass of sparkling Orders. The Viennese,\r\nwho are accustomed to decorations on a wholesale scale, as they are\r\nconferred for very slight services in Austria-Hungary, and worn with\r\ngreat ostentation by all and sundry at the Court, said he glittered and\r\nsparkled like a dancing girl at a fair. They were quick to mark the\r\npoint where the grandiose becomes ridiculous. They saw that a king so\r\noverloaded with Orders was absurd, not regal. “But, after all, for the\r\nBalkans--perhaps it impresses those savages down there at Sofia,” and\r\nwith a shrug of their shoulders they turned to look at his handsome\r\nsons, Slavonic in type, and without decorations; for Ferdinand never\r\nallowed his sons to play a leading _rôle_ in any way. They were simple\r\nsoldiers, who might mingle with the people and play the democrat while\r\nhe acted the sovereign lord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING FERDINAND OF BULGARIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING NIKITA OF MONTENEGRO.]\r\n\r\nThe sons made a much better impression upon the populace than the\r\nfather. They seemed to fit the frame into which they were born much\r\nbetter than the king who had been transported from living among the\r\ngayest and most cynical people in Europe to deal with the crude\r\nrealities of the Balkans. Ferdinand had left his country repeatedly\r\nwhen the fear of assassination was too much for him. He has always been\r\na coward. Even his soldierly training did not give him a grasp of what\r\nis expected of a man and a monarch. Like Kaiser Wilhelm, he always\r\nwore a mailed shirt or some other form of armour. Like Kaiser Wilhelm,\r\nhe felt peculiarly safe in Vienna, as the police system is so perfect\r\nthat any attempt upon the life of a monarch is almost impossible. They\r\nmanage to keep a record of the business of every person who comes to\r\nthe city. No suspects dare venture into the zone controlled by the\r\nVienna police. The Austrian Emperor, as long as his health allowed,\r\nstrolled about the city quite unconcerned for any danger. Kaiser\r\nWilhelm found, too, that he could promenade unguarded, simply because\r\nthe police had eliminated all chance of trouble. After the perils of\r\nSofia Ferdinand enjoyed this feeling of complete security among the\r\nlight-hearted Viennese. He would never have definitely broken with the\r\nEmperor of Austria, because his favourite retreat would have been\r\nclosed to him for ever. He had the feeling deep in his heart that he\r\nmight be forced to abdicate at any moment. Then Austria would afford\r\nhim shelter. There he could keep up his state, receive the respect and\r\nhomage due to one who had been king and retain his _amour propre_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Ferdinand had but a low estimate of the\r\nintellectual attainments and the mental grasp of the Emperor of Austria\r\nhimself. Like all the members of a younger generation who listened\r\nto the wisdom of Kaiser Wilhelm, he regarded him as “played out” and\r\na “back number.” This made him an easier tool in the hands of Kaiser\r\nWilhelm, and also led to his getting a reputation for treachery which\r\nperhaps he did not wholly deserve. There was a very general feeling in\r\nAustria-Hungary which was sedulously fostered by Kaiser Wilhelm and\r\nhis agents that promises made to the aged Emperor were not binding.\r\nThey were only given to humour the old man, who was already in his\r\ndotage. Ferdinand of Bulgaria on several occasions failed to keep his\r\nengagements to the Emperor, although they had been solemnly made.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm contrived to make Ferdinand and others besides see that\r\nthe aged Emperor was not a factor to be reckoned with seriously, and\r\nthat the Empire was crumbling visibly. He and Germany were all that\r\nmattered in Europe. These influences go far to explain Ferdinand’s\r\npolicy during the Balkan war and afterwards. A man who can be led by\r\nhis vanity is unfit for any position of importance, and still less\r\nto rule with an absolute sway such as he exercised in Bulgaria. His\r\nParliament, which should have exercised a restraining influence, was\r\nrendered useless, as the leading members could be “bought” at any time.\r\nReady money is rare in the Balkans, and the Austrian diplomatist knew\r\nfull well the price of every politician at Sofia. It was amazingly\r\nsmall. Sometimes they stood out for an Order as well as money as the\r\nprice of their dishonour, but as a rule money was sufficient to buy\r\nthem to betray their country. It is surprising that men who had risen\r\nstraight from the soil should have shown themselves so venial, but they\r\nhad the example of their king before them, and this explains much. The\r\natmosphere at Sofia was one of intrigue and crime. No one could stand\r\nagainst it. The common people, sturdy peasants, dimly comprehended that\r\ntheir king was not doing the best for them. They wished to join in\r\nany plot for his undoing that might be suggested to them. They looked\r\ntowards the Czar of All the Russias to deliver them from a distasteful\r\nalliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. This made Ferdinand anxious\r\nto conciliate Russia if he wished to retain the sympathies of his\r\npeople. The Austrians failed to understand these “extra tours,” as\r\nthey called Ferdinand’s sudden _volte-face_ in favour of Russia and\r\nthe Slavs. The Viennese, although they liked him, mistrusted him\r\nprofoundly. Just as some strange instinct led them to suspect the\r\nbluff friendliness of Kaiser Wilhelm, they regarded Ferdinand as an\r\nunknown book--a book of possibilities that might be to their advantage\r\nor might betray them to Russia, for both Germany and Austria-Hungary\r\nregarded the growing Russian menace with fear--a fear perhaps shared\r\nby Ferdinand, who had seen that Servia and Montenegro, who trusted\r\nimplicitly to Russia, had accomplished much of their aims. They had\r\nfulfilled many of their aspirations, and were in a fair way to realise\r\nthe rest. Ferdinand, instead of obtaining advantages for his country,\r\nwas now bribed to quiescence and silence by a new honour. The Golden\r\nFleece was conferred upon him. This gratification of his vanity bound\r\nhim closer to Austria-Hungary, for he owed the decoration to the good\r\noffices of Emperor Francis Joseph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE OF WIED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Powers of Europe decided that Albania should be constituted an\r\nindependent kingdom, and a king chosen from among the European princes.\r\nThe new ruler was to belong to some family that had possessed sovereign\r\nrights in the past, and this limited the choice very much. He was to\r\ncome to his new home with all the lustre lent by the acknowledgment\r\nof his fellow rulers to one of equal birth. Many candidates, more or\r\nless suitable, were ready to accept the throne. Europe discussed their\r\nrelative merits. The only people who had no voice at all in the matter\r\nwere the Albanians themselves. They naturally did not want a sovereign\r\nchosen by the Powers, but one selected by themselves. They frankly said\r\na complete stranger should be chosen, as the Roman Catholic tribes\r\nwould not acknowledge the domination of a Mohammedan; the Mohammedans\r\nwould object to the chief of one of the Christian tribes; and the\r\nGreeks would submit to neither. Europe knew full well that the task\r\nof civilising the nation would be no easy one, and it was generally\r\nthought that the life of the new king would not be worth a month’s\r\npurchase. Some of the malcontents were certain to attempt his life,\r\nalmost as certain to succeed in killing him. Other people said that\r\nthe task of ruling over Albania need not be more difficult than that\r\nof civilising Rumania or Bulgaria, and that it was only a question of\r\nfinding the right man. Unfortunately, the Powers did not act loyally\r\ntowards the new country. They made no attempt to study the interests of\r\nthe population, but sought a ruler whose selection should provoke the\r\nminimum of objection from the other Powers. Germany wanted to place a\r\nGerman prince on the throne. Italy naturally objected to any man who\r\nwould be a mere puppet in the hands of Austria or Germany. Austria\r\nobjected to any Italian candidates. Finally the Powers agreed to accept\r\na prince of irreproachable reputation and sprung from a very old\r\nfamily, but utterly devoid of brains. The Prince von Wied was selected\r\nfor his lack of any prominent characteristics. The new prince had the\r\noutward appearance of a monarch, being extremely tall and handsome,\r\nwhile his reputation as a military man left nothing to be desired.\r\nNothing had ever been heard of him outside or indeed inside Germany,\r\nand the news was soon circulated in the inner circles of diplomacy that\r\nhe had simply been selected as a figure-head. It was never expected\r\nthat he would accomplish anything in any way. He had spent his life in\r\nGerman military circles and was the “ideal officer.” Like most of his\r\nbrethren in arms, he was empty-headed, possessed of an intelligence\r\nbelow the average, and spent his time in looking after his estates.\r\nThis negative information was not unsatisfactory. The most important\r\nfact about the prince was carefully concealed, however. He was deep\r\nin debt. This was common among the young German officers, but whereas\r\ntheir debts were limited by the fact that purveyors refused to trust\r\nthem, the Prince of Wied was heavily involved. The Albanians, who had\r\nagents all over Europe, discovered his predicament. They considered\r\nthat a Balkan king must possess a fortune of his own, as they did not\r\nwish to pay a large civil list. All the Balkan princes who had come as\r\nstrangers into the land brought riches and not debts with them. This\r\ngave them weight, not only among their peers, but also among their\r\nsubjects. A prince or king cannot be a pauper. Quite apart from minor\r\nconsiderations, his monetary difficulties would make him venial. The\r\nAlbanians, accustomed to bribery and to rulers of very questionable\r\nmorality, openly voiced this objection. They had no opinion of German\r\nor any other probity when exposed to temptation. The Italians in\r\nAlbania, who had hoped for an Italian duke to forward their interests,\r\ndid their best to exaggerate the financial straits of the Prince von\r\nWied. While many stories about his poverty were heard, nothing was\r\nsaid about the family estates, which had been sufficient guarantee\r\nfor the moneylenders. The moneylenders, who were ready to trust the\r\nPrince of Wied indefinitely, refused however to leave their money\r\nwith a Balkan prince; that was a different matter. Jokes were heard\r\nin the cafés about the “pauper king” and Europe’s appointment of a\r\n“beggar sovereign.” The Servians, whose kings were poor but honest,\r\nopenly derided the new importation. All these reports spread throughout\r\nAlbania like wildfire. It is remarkable that news is circulated much\r\nmore quickly in Albania than in civilised countries. It is always\r\nthe salient facts that are seized upon, unimportant details being\r\nneglected in a manner peculiar to people who can neither read nor\r\nwrite, and whose heads are therefore phenomenally clear. Descriptions\r\nof the Prince, allusions to his martial figure, were good enough for\r\nthe German papers.\r\n\r\nAlbania did not heed them. She knew that she was to be governed by a\r\nman who knew no word of the language, who brought no troops with him,\r\nand who not only had no money but was deep in debt. It was not thus\r\nthat Albania pictured her king. She would even prefer to live under\r\nthe domination of one of the native princes, who would have been as\r\nsuccessful as the King of Montenegro in keeping his subjects in due\r\norder. There were several of these men who could have mounted the\r\nthrone, and who would have known how to wield the sceptre. It did not\r\nsuit Europe to create an independent Albania, however. Neither Italy\r\nnor Austria really wished the new venture to be a success, as they\r\ndesired to share Albania, dividing it into two spheres of influence.\r\n\r\nPrince von Wied had one saving virtue--he was modest and had no\r\ndelusions on the subject of his capabilities. He hesitated greatly\r\nbefore accepting the charge. Alone, he would never have assumed the\r\noffice thrust upon him. Unfortunately, he had a wife who was both\r\nambitious and lacking in intelligence. The Princess of Wied imagined\r\nthat the Albanians could be ruled by the introduction of the same\r\nmethods that impressed the intellectual circles in a German town.\r\nShe was accustomed to preside over a number of ladies, “seekers of\r\nculture,” and thought that she could exercise a similar influence over\r\nthe Albanians. Neither she nor her husband realised that, when they\r\nleft Germany for Albania, they were stepping right out of the twentieth\r\ncentury into the tenth. They both imagined that the Albanians would\r\nbe impressed by the antique furniture which they sent on in advance\r\nto furnish the villa at Durazzo, not realising that the Albanians,\r\naccustomed to all the pomp of the Turkish pasha, simply regarded their\r\n“antiques” as a collection of quaint-looking lumber. The Albanians were\r\ncorrect in their estimate, for the objects which Princess von Wied\r\nconsidered so valuable were seen to be mere rubbish by the connoisseur.\r\nThe Vienna furnishers who came down to arrange for the arrival of the\r\nnew Prince, were horrified at the condition in which they found the\r\npalace. It was built, like all Albanian houses, as a kind of fortress.\r\nThere were no windows at all on the lower floors. Loopholes, from\r\nwhich the muzzles of guns projected, served instead of windows. Large\r\napertures were too dangerous in a country inhabited by natives who were\r\nin the habit of potting-at the occupants of rooms on the ground floor.\r\nInside the immense barn-like house the Vienna furnishers found vermin\r\nof all sorts. This is common in Albania, but the state of the palace\r\nwas such that it should have warned them that the coming Prince was not\r\npopular, for they might have known that the rats had been introduced\r\ninto the apartments as a protest. The rat-holes were hastily stopped\r\nup with cement, the mildewed walls were draped with costly hangings,\r\nbut the workmen who were taken down for the job felt that it was no\r\nplace either for a lady or children, and said so freely. Although they\r\ncould not speak the Albanian language, they felt the antipathy of the\r\nnatives. They were aware of the opposition that showed itself in a\r\nhundred different ways, too small to particularise, but all of which\r\nrevealed dangers and difficulties for the new monarch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRINCE OF WIED.]\r\n\r\nThe Prince made a round of the chief Courts of Europe, before reaching\r\nhis new country. His fellow sovereigns were willing to do all they\r\ncould to give him a good “send-off,” and he was fêted everywhere.\r\nDiplomatists, accustomed to judging men, thought very poorly of his\r\nchances of success. He had numberless opportunities of finding out\r\nsomething about his future subjects. Men fresh from the Balkans were\r\ninvited to meet him, but he did not care to avail himself of their\r\ninformation. Neither did he consult any statesmen of experience as to\r\nhow he should act in any given circumstances; he appeared to think that\r\nhe would know all this by instinct when once he had assumed the crown.\r\nThus those accustomed to the cares of State watched the new man depart\r\nwith strong misgivings.\r\n\r\nThe manner of his arrival was the initial mistake. He slipped into\r\nhis new kingdom almost unannounced. He sneaked into the country like\r\na political refugee who wishes to avoid the notice of the police. A\r\nhandful of Albanians, gathered together at the last moment, shouted\r\n“Hurrah!” when he appeared, but even their enthusiasm was purchased,\r\nand not having been paid for on the usual scale, was correspondingly\r\nfeeble and ineffectual. After making this unfortunate entry, the\r\nPrince settled down to do--nothing. The Albanians had learnt that\r\nthe money given by the Powers for the administration of Albania had\r\nbeen applied to pay the Prince’s private debts, as the creditors had\r\nrefused to allow him to leave Germany with his obligations unsettled;\r\nand they refused to welcome him. The Princess decorated her house,\r\nand attended to the furnishing of rooms for her children. She, at\r\nleast, was delighted at the chance of being able to play at being a\r\nreal Princess. The Prince himself was less contented. He was doubtful\r\nof the intentions of Essad Pasha, and confused by the different\r\ninstructions he had received. Kaiser Wilhelm had promised to stand by\r\nhim in his usual “shining armour” fashion, if he did exactly as the\r\nGerman envoy suggested. The Prince, however, was shrewd enough to see\r\nthat German influence was of little value in the Balkans. Italy was\r\nevidently the dominant Power in Albania. Her agents had spent money\r\nfreely. The Prince had reason to believe that Austria and Germany had\r\nalso made large expenditures on the glorious work of colonisation, but\r\nhe failed to observe the fruits. The younger generation of Albanians\r\nspoke Italian, which was taught in the schools. Proficiency in Italian\r\nwas necessary for all who engaged in commerce and trade, as all the\r\ncoasting business was with Italy. Although attempts had been made\r\nto establish schools where instruction was imparted in German, they\r\nrefused to attend them and were very averse to adopting German habits\r\nor customs. While the Prince spent his time in avoiding complications,\r\nby remaining within the palace, the Princess conferred with Viennese\r\ndecorators about the furnishing. This naturally prejudiced the local\r\nworkmen, and showed that she had not any grasp of the first duties of\r\na ruling princess. Shortly after the arrival of the new Royal family,\r\nnews was received that Albanian insurgents were advancing upon the\r\ncapital. No one knew what they wanted. It is doubtful whether they\r\nknew themselves. They were aware that there was loot to be had in\r\nthe palace. Perhaps that was the secret of then coming. The Prince,\r\nwho had insisted upon two warships being stationed off Durazzo, now\r\ntelegraphed for aid. More ships were sent. The Powers regarded this as\r\nunnecessary--Durazzo is situated at the farther end of a peninsula. The\r\nonly path between Durazzo and the mainland is over a bottomless morass.\r\nThe insurgents could only approach the place in single file and the\r\napproach to the palace could be swept by the cannon on the warships.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian insurgents might attempt a surprise attack, but all\r\nthrough the night searchlights swept the narrow neck of land that led\r\nto Durazzo.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was afraid of the unknown. Away from drill books and\r\ncivilisation, he was quite helpless. It was at this critical moment\r\nthat one of the cleverest diplomatists in Europe--the Italian Minister,\r\nAlliotto--who had been sent to Albania with a watching brief, played\r\nhis trump card. When the danger seemed worst, he persuaded the Prince\r\nto flee. The “modern knight,” the representative of up-to-date chivalry\r\nas practised in the Guards in Berlin, actually fled from his new\r\ncountry and took refuge on the battleship. After several hours’ stay\r\non the ship nothing happened, and he realised that he had been fooled\r\nby the astute diplomatist. The palace was not looted, could never have\r\nbeen looted, with the guns from the warships turned upon the twisting\r\npath across the marshes. No single Albanian insurgent could reach the\r\nspot. He left his wife and children in safety, and returned to the\r\ncapital he had left, to resume a crown as one resumes an umbrella laid\r\ndown at the club. He was received with derision. All Europe had got\r\nnews of his flight. The Italian diplomatist had taken care of that.\r\nPhotographs were taken on the spot. They showed the Prince leaving the\r\npalace in a panic and getting into the ship’s boat, and afterwards\r\nclimbing up the side of the ship. They were circulated through the\r\nEuropean Press. Pictures of the palace, and of the small groups of\r\ntatterdemalions who had forced a German Prince and military expert to\r\nabdicate, were sown broadcast. Europe did not know that a swift little\r\nItalian boat had been waiting for weeks to carry away the news. The\r\nItalians knew that Germany and Austria would contradict the news of the\r\nPrince’s flight. So they said: “Photographs cannot be contradicted. Let\r\nus have plenty.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince was the laughing-stock of Europe. He was forced to abdicate.\r\nEven the Kaiser felt he could not advise him to remain on the throne\r\nafter the painful incident. He did not even dare to return to Germany,\r\nbut spent months in Italy, travelling, before he cared to face the\r\nmusic at Berlin. Germany and Austria had played against Italy for\r\ndiplomatic supremacy in Albania. Italy had won all along the line. Not\r\nonly had she succeeded in disgracing the German princelet, she had\r\nattained her own object, too--lowering Austrian prestige in the Balkans\r\nand raising her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE BLACK MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting figure in South-Eastern Europe was King Nikita.\r\nHe ruled over the smallest patch of country that can call itself a\r\nkingdom, but he is, perhaps, a more consummate diplomatist than any\r\nof his fellow Balkan monarchs who have been swayed by the King of\r\nMontenegro without suspecting it. He has great influence in a number\r\nof countries. This is due to his extraordinary foresight. He had a\r\nfamily of girls, who came of untainted stock, with a family reputation\r\nfor sound health, both physical and mental. Surrounded by his handsome\r\nfamily, he realised that Europe was tired of German princesses--that\r\ntheir presence in every Court of Europe was unpleasing to many\r\nmonarchs, who did not wish German women to know State secrets and\r\nto be in a position to pass them on to powerful relatives at home.\r\nHe appears to have made a complete study of the subject of royal\r\nmarriages. His girls, unlike the ordinary Balkan princesses, were\r\nbrought up very simply. It is even reported that they were able to\r\nmilk the cows and goats that strayed near the country home where they\r\nwere educated. They had a training in practical housework, which took\r\nthe place of the frivolities that usually go to make up princesses’\r\nlives. When they became of marriageable age, Nikita secluded them more\r\ncarefully than before. No breath of scandal ever touched them. But\r\ntheir good qualities were reported far and wide, and did not escape\r\nthose monarchs who were in search of a wife for the heir to the throne.\r\nNikita managed to secure the throne of Italy for one daughter. The\r\nItalians are always grateful to the King for bestowing his daughter\r\nupon their ruler. The children that have been born to him are healthy\r\nbeyond those of any of the aristocrats that surround the throne, for\r\nthey inherit the sound constitution of their grandfather, the heartiest\r\nand halest man in Europe. The Grand Duke who took a daughter of the\r\nKing of Montenegro to preside over his vast estates in Russia has never\r\nregretted his choice. Although both men have a needy father-in-law,\r\nand perhaps grudge the money that frequently flows to Cettinje, they\r\nhave secured wives with virtues that are worth much gold. The King of\r\nMontenegro enjoyed immunity from attack because of his highly placed\r\nsons-in-law, and was able to play a part in the politics of Europe\r\nthat would not have been possible under other circumstances. After\r\nhaving taken the title of King instead of Prince, he came to Vienna\r\nto pay his first visit in the new capacity. Emperor Francis Joseph,\r\never ready to support all dignitaries, received him in a worthy\r\nmanner, putting a suite of rooms reserved for kings at his disposal.\r\nKing Nikita, who was seldom seen in Vienna, was decidedly popular,\r\nand the crowd showed great enthusiasm in welcoming him. He managed\r\nto enhance the importance of his visit by a circumstance that caused\r\nmuch speculation at the time. It was arranged that Nikita should go\r\nto the races and watch the Austrian “Derby,” the closing event of the\r\nearly summer season. He was accompanied by Archduke Francis Ferdinand\r\nand Duchess Hohenberg and a number of other members of the Imperial\r\nfamily, who always crowded into the Imperial box at the races, as they\r\nare all intensely interested in all that concerns horses. The King of\r\nMontenegro is also interested in everything connected with outdoor\r\nsports, and looked forward to the event. Early on that Sunday morning\r\nthe rumour was circulated in Vienna that an attempt was to be made upon\r\nthe life of the visitor. Why anyone should wish to assassinate the King\r\nof Montenegro was a mystery--whether the King had the report circulated\r\nhimself to increase his importance, or what it meant, was not clear.\r\nAll Vienna hurried down, in spite of the blazing heat; no one wished\r\nto be absent at such a time. The police had taken precautions, which\r\nshowed that they at least anticipated something. Every visitor to the\r\nImperial enclosure had to walk through a long line of detectives and\r\ndiplomatic agents. If none of them recognised him, he was followed\r\nand carefully hustled, as if by accident, into a corner far off the\r\nImperial box. Other detectives crowded him and ascertained whether he\r\nhad a bomb about his person by bumping against him. Persons in official\r\ncapacities were, on the contrary, propelled as if by some unseen force\r\nto the front of the box, where they were forced to remain by pure\r\nphysical pressure of the cordon of police in plain clothes, in spite\r\nof the blazing sun that beat down on the racecourse. The old King came\r\ninto the box. Duchess Hohenberg sat at his right, and entertained him\r\nin her best and most vivacious manner. He greatly appreciated the\r\ntrouble that she was taking with him in pointing out the different\r\nhorses and telling him which colours belonged to this great aristocrat\r\nor that great politician. Archduchess Maria Annunziata, the abbess of\r\na Bohemian convent, who had been charged with the task of conversing\r\nwith the King, was only too willing to relinquish her seat of honour\r\nand to retire to the back to watch the racing with one of the juvenile\r\nArchdukes. The King watched the pretty woman by his side with\r\nadmiration; her animation pleased him. Nikita felt in his element, the\r\nmost important man in the place. He did not cut a bad figure even among\r\nthe Austrian and Hungarian Archdukes, who are finely-built men, many of\r\nthem being extraordinarily handsome. After the event of the afternoon\r\nwas run and the cheering had ceased, the King, Archduke and Duchess\r\ndeparted, as is the custom of royalty. The members of the Imperial\r\nfamily stayed to watch the rest of the events, and only left five\r\nminutes before the end.\r\n\r\nUpon the departure of the King and the Archduke the police cordon\r\nimmediately relaxed. Persons who had been sandwiched in to form part\r\nof the buffer that protected the Imperial box had free passage.\r\nThe feeling of oppression, of expectation, relaxed. But still there\r\nwas no explanation of the mysterious threats against the life of so\r\nunimportant a sovereign as the King of Montenegro. In the light of\r\nafter events it occurred to many who assisted at that running of the\r\nDerby that it was the life of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand which\r\nwas sought on that day. It was the first time for many months that\r\nhe had appeared in public, and the dislike felt for him both by the\r\npeople and by his near relatives had reached a dangerous pitch. No\r\nsuch tragedy as happened later at Sarajevo took place simply because\r\nthe Austrian police was so efficiently organised and so powerful that\r\nit could prevent anything of the sort by a process of elimination. The\r\nsame process might be witnessed every summer in Ischl, where no one was\r\nallowed to take up his residence unless he could give a satisfactory\r\naccount of himself to the police. This was easy in Austria-Hungary, as\r\nthere was no shifting population to be dealt with. An exact record of\r\nthe past life of every person resident within the empire is kept. All\r\nsuspects are watched. Thus Austria was the safest place in Europe for\r\nmonarchs.\r\n\r\nKing Nikita departed as he had arrived, amid the acclamations of the\r\npopulation. He had been gratified by the invitation, and King Peter of\r\nServia had been correspondingly humiliated. He had never been invited\r\nto come to the Austro-Hungarian Court. This was a standing source of\r\nannoyance to the Serbs, who considered that it would have given him the\r\nprestige that he somehow lacked. They considered that the tragedy that\r\nhad preceded his accession to the throne should be forgotten after the\r\nlapse of years. Emperor Francis Joseph, one of whose chief aims in life\r\nis the maintenance of the dignity of rulers and the magnifying of the\r\nvocation of kings, did not take this view. He said that as long as he\r\nlived King Peter should never come to Vienna. It would, perhaps, have\r\nbeen better had less been done to honour the King of Montenegro under\r\nthese circumstances. In this and many other trifling affairs the wounds\r\nalready inflicted upon Servian _amour propre_ were kept open instead of\r\nbeing allowed to heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nEMIGRATION PROMOTED BY GERMANY--SOCIAL QUESTIONS IN THE DUAL MONARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numbers of emigrants to Canada, the States, and South America\r\nhad been increasing in an alarming manner for many years. The large\r\nband of men who left their country might be divided into two classes.\r\nThe larger class was composed of men who, weary of living under\r\nAustro-Hungarian administration, left the country for good, worked for\r\nmoney to build up a new home beyond the seas, and subsequently sent\r\nmoney to pay the fares of their wives and children, or other relatives\r\nto the new country.\r\n\r\nThe second class of emigrant that swelled the returns was the “season\r\nemigrant.” He left for one, two, or three years, supported his family\r\nat home while working abroad, and returned with his savings at the\r\nend of the time to enrich the country of his birth. This class of\r\nman increased the prosperity of the country. The American Government\r\nencouraged the permanent emigrant and objected to the “season”\r\nemigrant, who refused to become naturalised, and formed part of a large\r\nforeign element that it always regarded as potentially dangerous. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government, on the contrary, naturally encouraged\r\nthe “season” emigrant, and did everything possible to deter men from\r\nagricultural countries from emigrating permanently.\r\n\r\nDuring the Balkan wars the subject-races, always oppressed by the\r\nCentral Government, were subjected to much harsh treatment because\r\ndisorders were feared. Repressive measures were carried out very\r\ncruelly; no allowance was made for race and natural sympathy with\r\ntheir relatives across the border. The governors cared nothing if\r\nthey could cow the population into obedience. The more independent\r\nspirits naturally escaped beyond the seas to avoid persecution. The\r\nmobilisation and the long time that the army remained on the frontiers\r\nmade the Slavs fear that a war was coming. They did not desire to fight\r\nagainst the Serbs nor the Russians. The Austro-Italians who inhabit the\r\nsouthern coast-line and man the Austro-Hungarian fleet did not wish to\r\nbe called upon to fight against Italy. Thus almost all the inhabitants\r\nnear the coast considered it better to get away while they could, and\r\nemigration on a vast scale began. Whole regions were depopulated. It\r\nwas impossible to move off the main route of travel in Austria-Hungary\r\nat this period without being literally besieged by would-be emigrants.\r\nHow could they learn English? Could it be done by correspondence? What\r\nother qualifications were necessary for emigrants to the States? It\r\nseemed as if the whole agricultural population was packing up to leave.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor once wished to send some rare game to New Zealand, and\r\nasked for a couple of men to accompany them. The entire country-side\r\noffered to travel with them to the far-off land, intending never\r\nto return. Istria, Hungary, Galicia, and the Bukowina swarmed with\r\nemigration agents. These agents were quite unscrupulous in their\r\nmethods. They simply desired to make money quickly. They got the\r\nusual bonus from the companies on each emigrant induced to travel by\r\ntheir line, and besides were subsidised by big companies who wished\r\nto populate large tracts of land abroad. These companies promised the\r\nemigrants free holdings. The peasant, who was greedy for freehold\r\nland, naturally jumped at the offer, and left his village without much\r\npersuasion. The agents, knowing full well that the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment must not get information as to the way in which the country\r\nwas being literally bled of its best military material, shipped the\r\nyoung men of military age _viâ_ Bremen or Hamburg. The wives and\r\nchildren went _viâ_ Trieste or Fiume. Thus the figures sent in to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government gave no indication of what was going on.\r\nThis business went on undetected for about ten years.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the explosion came. Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to\r\nthe throne, discovered that a hundred thousand recruits fit for service\r\nhad got away in a single year. An inquiry was held into the matter. A\r\nramification of frauds, such as could only exist where the officials\r\nwere in sympathy with the population, was discovered. In many cases\r\nboys were registered as girls with female names. When they grew up they\r\nleft the country or remained in some remote village where no one had\r\nany interest to reveal their presence. Their employers did not want to\r\nspare them for the army. Others whose mothers had not been sufficiently\r\nfar-seeing to arrange matters early in life emigrated, with documents\r\nborrowed from a friend for the occasion. The documents were then sent\r\nback by messenger over the frontier to the rightful owner. When either\r\nof these methods was impracticable, medical certificates testifying\r\nunfitness were procured. Certificates of this kind were cheap. The\r\ndemand was so great that there was a keen competition, and military\r\ndoctors were not able to stand out for large bribes, especially in\r\nout-of-the-way places. The feeling of the whole country was with the\r\nman who refused to fight for the German and Magyar overlords.\r\n\r\nA number of emigration agents were hastily clapped into prison,\r\ntravelling offices were closed, and a minute investigation was begun.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, who undertook the task himself, soon\r\ndiscovered that Austria-Hungary had been drained of its best fighting\r\nmaterial by Germany. Cheap passages had been offered to emigrants\r\nby the Hamburg and Bremen lines. They were no doubt anxious to make\r\nsubstantial profits. He went into the figures and was startled to find\r\nthat the heavy Government subsidies enabled them to carry emigrants at\r\na loss. He immediately detected the hand of Kaiser Wilhelm behind this.\r\nGermany had robbed her Poles of their land in order to colonise German\r\nPoland with Teutons. The Kaiser was now trying to drain Austria-Hungary\r\nof its Slav population and to replace them by German emigrants. That\r\nwas the meaning of the great emigrant traffic and of the secrecy with\r\nwhich it had been carried on.\r\n\r\nFrancis Ferdinand was furious when he discovered the truth. Men of\r\nmilitary age were not allowed to cross the frontier without explaining\r\nwhere they were going.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants, however, got away in hundreds every week, in spite of\r\nall restrictions. The trouble that had been made about recruits leaving\r\nthe country convinced people on the frontiers and at the sea coast that\r\na great war was coming. The Slavs and the Italians, who were determined\r\nnot to be involved, took train to the nearest frontier station and\r\nsimply walked across without passports. It was soon discovered that\r\nas the German emigration figures fell, the numbers of young men of\r\nmilitary age leaving Russia and Italy for the States increased.\r\nEmigration had not been stopped; it had only been diverted to other\r\nchannels. This discovery enraged the Austrian Government.\r\n\r\nSentinels were posted on the frontiers to watch for young men, but as\r\nthe sentinels belonged to the disaffected races the men got past all\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe restriction upon emigration pressed particularly hardly upon\r\nthe Bosnian Slavs. The seething discontent that had increased every\r\nyear since the annexation would never have become dangerous had the\r\nrestless spirits been allowed to leave for the States. Families would\r\nhave felt that their sons were safe from the bad treatment in the\r\narmy and would have waited patiently until they had enough money to\r\njoin them in the States. The sudden checking of all these hopes,\r\nthe shutting of the only door of escape, brought the discontent to\r\na head. There were rumours of disaffection among the subject-races\r\neverywhere. Sure of a warm welcome from their fellow-countrymen on the\r\nother side should trouble force them to leave, the people along the\r\nfrontiers became very restless. There was every indication that the\r\nAustro-Hungarian conglomeration of nationalities and States could not\r\nbe kept together much longer. Archduke Francis Ferdinand was pleased\r\nat these indications. He, in common with the remainder of the military\r\nparty, was looking for an excuse for a war. Thus he and the army put\r\nmore pressure upon the Serbs in Hungary instead of relieving them from\r\nsome of the grosser forms of oppression. Kaiser Wilhelm encouraged the\r\nArchduke in this policy. He wished Austria-Hungary to realise that it\r\nhad reached a crisis in its history that could only be solved by a war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE AGRARIANS AND THE SHORTAGE OF FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Agrarians, or great landowners, both in Austria and Hungary were\r\nlargely responsible for the Great War. If commercial relations between\r\nAustria and the Balkans had been satisfactory there would have been\r\nno discontent. The Balkans are agricultural lands; large crops of\r\ncorn, vegetable products, and meat were produced. Hungary is also a\r\nrich agricultural country, and supplies its own needs entirely, with a\r\nsurplus for Austria. Austria and Germany cannot exist on the produce\r\nof their land. Both countries have densely populated manufacturing\r\ndistricts that must be supplied with food. Hungary wished to obtain\r\nthe best prices for her commodities. She therefore objected to Balkan\r\nproducts being imported. The goods had to enter over her railways.\r\nShe prevented their coming in by imposing vexatious restrictions and\r\nrefusing cargoes on all kinds of grounds. Austria would not forbid\r\nthe import of meat and other products directly. This would have\r\nprejudiced her political relations with the Balkans. Nor did she wish\r\nto discourage the Balkan peoples from breeding cattle. The shortage\r\nof meat in Austria might force the Government to import it at any\r\ntime. So she took a most unworthy course. She allowed the Agrarians\r\nto carry on their nefarious methods and thus earned the bitter hatred\r\nof the Balkan peoples, especially of Servia and Montenegro. For some\r\nyears cattle-breeders in the Balkan countries did not realise why\r\ntheir products were returned so frequently. Finally, discovering that\r\nthey were simply the playthings of the Agrarians, they ceased to breed\r\ncattle and turned their vast pastures into corn land. The Agrarians,\r\nmen who travelled but little and had no grasp of the speed with which\r\ninnovations are introduced and new plans adopted in this century, were\r\nsadly surprised and not a little dismayed when they discovered that\r\nthe Serbs and other Balkan countries had no more meat for sale. Every\r\nsummer there was a considerable shortage of meat in Austria and the\r\ncities of Hungary. This was due to a number of causes insignificant\r\nin themselves, but far-reaching as regards the history of Europe. The\r\nbutchers said the regular annual shortage was largely owing to supplies\r\nbeing sent to Germany, to Bohemia, and the Tyrol in the tourist season,\r\nwhen large quantities of meat were required for the foreigners who\r\ncame into the country. The real reason was that the country was being\r\ndrained of its best blood by emigration. Farmers were forced to kill\r\noff their cattle because there were no shepherds to care for it. The\r\nday of the small peasant-proprietor was over. He had left for the\r\nStates. It was found more profitable to grow corn than to keep cattle\r\nfor the market on the immense farms on the great Hungarian plains.\r\nNo one had realised that the Balkan States had rendered themselves\r\nindependent of Austria-Hungary, and that no supply would be forthcoming\r\neven when the frontiers were thrown open. The Agrarians, when they\r\nheard of the shortage, suggested that the people should do without\r\nmeat. Riots ensued, and violent scenes occurred in Vienna. The military\r\nwas brought out to disperse the crowd. Hungarian hussars were brought\r\nfrom Budapesth to shoot on a crowd chiefly made up of Germans and\r\nSlavs. As the soldiers rode forward to charge the people in front of\r\nthe Vienna Rathhaus, women climbed into their saddles, and, rendered\r\ndesperate by fear for their husbands and children, wound themselves\r\nround the waists of the hussars, thus effectually preventing them\r\nfrom using their swords. Some men had four women hanging from their\r\nwaists as they charged upon the crowd. The horses, trained for show\r\nand parade, were very careful not to dislodge the extra riders and\r\nadvanced at an amble. The Hungarian officers who led the men tried\r\nto incite them to show a different spirit, but although they charged\r\nthe crowd not more than a hundred civilians were seriously injured.\r\nThe men cut the air above their heads with their long sabres, and\r\nalthough they were Hungarians and Magyars, and were faced by a crowd\r\nthey disliked and despised, humanitarian feelings were stronger\r\nthan the commands of their officers. Many people in Vienna that day\r\ndoubted whether conscripts would ever fight against the populace.\r\nBefore night, however, the spirit of the troops changed. The people,\r\ndesperate with hunger, put up barricades in some of the chief streets;\r\nthey tore down the gas lamps and set fire to the stream of coal-gas\r\nthus released. They plundered the shops of unpopular tradesmen and\r\ndistributed eatables among the crowd. When the troops appeared they\r\nwere received by a shower of stones, while even the pavements were\r\ntorn up to provide missiles. The soldiers, thoroughly enraged, turned\r\na murderous fire upon the people. The city was put under martial law,\r\nand everyone who ventured through the streets was searched for weapons.\r\nWalking the streets was a dangerous pastime for strangers, as sentries\r\nonly challenged once and shot if the command to halt were not complied\r\nwith. Similar riots on a larger scale took place in Budapesth. They\r\nwere suppressed in a more brutal manner than those in Vienna, while\r\nin Prague the situation became so alarming that a revolution was\r\nfeared. It was then that the Agrarian party became alarmed, and agreed\r\nto a suggestion for the importation of frozen meat from Argentina. A\r\ncommittee of officials and experts was sent to Argentina to arrange for\r\nthe sending of frozen meat to Trieste. The Argentine Government was\r\nready to comply with all the very intricate demands and requirements\r\nof the Austrian Government, and, being unversed in the history\r\nof the Balkans, believed that Austria was capable of a perfectly\r\nstraightforward deal. One party of the Government, seeing the gravity\r\nof the disturbances, really wished to alleviate the sufferings of the\r\npeople by the importation of frozen meat. The Agrarians, on whose head\r\nthe blood-guilt of the European war really rests, played the same\r\nunstatesmanlike trick upon Argentina as they had successfully carried\r\nout in the case of the Balkans. The first load of meat duly arrived. It\r\nwas sold immediately. This did not suit the short-sighted Agrarians,\r\nwho immediately began a plan for the defeat of the innovation. With the\r\nconsent of the Government they began an agitation against frozen meat.\r\nButchers circulated stories that it was unsound, and as it was sold\r\nat prices that corresponded very nearly with those of fresh meat, it\r\nnaturally remained on their hands. This was seized upon as an excuse\r\nby the Government to stop the import of any more meat. Even then the\r\nGovernment could not act with common straightforwardness. The cargo was\r\nallowed to come, and turned back at Trieste. The boat ran over to an\r\nItalian port, where the meat was sold without difficulty. But Austrian\r\ncredit had suffered largely. The political relations with Argentina\r\nwere strained, and the country lost many a good customer through her\r\ndishonesty. This mattered little to the Agrarians, who got good prices\r\nfor their meat.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt was made to introduce sea-fish for popular consumption.\r\nThe Government put a quick goods train service on from the Adriatic,\r\nand with cars especially constructed for keeping fresh fish in ice\r\nthrough the hot nights. This did not suit the Agrarians, who had\r\nimmense breeding-places for carp and who reared trout in their\r\nstreams. As was to be expected, the trains were delayed, and the fish\r\nreached Vienna and Budapesth in a state unfit for food. No statesman\r\nin Austria-Hungary raised his voice against this trickery. No one\r\ncared whether the people starved or not, provided the Agrarians were\r\nsatisfied. Archdukes, who might have raised their voices and have made\r\nthem heard, were themselves engaged in trade. They had immense dairies\r\nand other establishments, where the produce of their lands was sold.\r\nTheir interests were contrary to those of the people and to those of\r\nthe country at large. They sided with the Agrarians in what was a\r\ncrisis in their own history and that of their country. Meat riots were\r\nsucceeded by disturbances about house accommodation. In order to keep\r\nup rents, regulations preventing the building of new blocks of flats\r\nwere made in both Vienna and Budapesth. Similar enactments existed in\r\nmany other large cities in Austria-Hungary, but they pressed hardest\r\nof all in the capitals. The landlords, freed from healthy competition,\r\nnot only demanded high rents, but they refused to accept tenants with\r\nchildren. Men well able to pay high rents were forced to go from house\r\nto house begging the porter to show them flats, and were turned away\r\ntime and time again simply because they had the misfortune to have a\r\nfamily consisting not of six healthy children, but of one quiet child\r\nof ten. At one period things were so bad that a workman with six\r\nchildren, who had been unable to get accommodation anywhere, camped out\r\nwith his family on the Graben, the chief promenade in the very centre\r\nof the city. Others knocked up wooden shanties on Crown land near the\r\nmountains. At last the city decided to put up a number of sheds for the\r\naccommodation of persons who had been expelled from the flats because\r\nthey had children. In Budapesth things were much worse. There were\r\nriots, and the effigies of unpopular landlords were burned. Troops were\r\ncalled out and rioters shot, but this brutal suppression of the working\r\nclass only increased the irritation felt against the Government. It was\r\nclear even to the uninitiated that affairs were reaching a climax. The\r\ndiscontent that had begun in the working classes was quickly spreading\r\nto the small employé and even to the professional classes and officers\r\nin the army. This was due not only to lack of food or accommodation,\r\nbut to the enormous increase in the cost of living, which had its root\r\nin the alarming rise in taxation. This taxation was due to the two\r\nmobilisations during the Annexation crisis and the Balkan wars, which\r\nhad cost Austria-Hungary many millions. The discovery that many things\r\nessential to an army were lacking had led to reckless expenditure. Not\r\nonly had money been spent on legitimate needs, but immense swindles\r\nhad been perpetrated in connection with army supplies. Highly-placed\r\npersonages had been connected with these incidents which consequently\r\nwere never properly sifted, those most deeply implicated having the\r\npower to prevent investigation. Further, mistakes on a vast scale were\r\nmade. The type of cannon recommended for the army, and supplied to all\r\nthe regiments, proved to be quite useless when employed in frontier\r\nskirmishes. It was replaced by new weapons at enormous cost. Other\r\noccurrences of the same kind led to the Budget being far above the\r\nyearly income of the State. It became apparent to all responsible for\r\nthe conduct of the State that something must happen. The strain was too\r\ngreat--a breakdown somewhere was inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCOUNT LEOPOLD BERCHTOLD AND COUNT STEPAN TISZA, THE MEN WHO DECIDED ON\r\nWAR\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister who was responsible\r\nfor the policy that led to the Great War, is the prototype of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian aristocrat, and essentially a gentleman. He was for\r\nthis reason totally unfit to cope with the crowd of unscrupulous\r\npro-German politicians around him. He was brought up in the old school,\r\nand no one who knows him personally would hesitate to describe him as\r\na gentleman _par excellence_. The fine, delicate features, the slim,\r\nslender hands, and a bearing that has something almost apologetic, are\r\ncharacteristic of the man. He is the ideal landowner and feudal lord,\r\nable to manage large estates, a merciful landlord who would remit rent\r\nin bad years, a kindly neighbour, and valued friend.\r\n\r\nCount Berchtold’s greatest interest was horse-racing, and his large\r\nfortune enabled him to keep a splendid stud. He invariably attended all\r\nthe big race-meetings, but he was there merely to watch the horses,\r\nnot to meet the representatives of the diplomatic and political world\r\nlike his fellow-officials. His eye never wandered from the course\r\nduring the whole meeting. Other politicians never so much as glanced at\r\nthe horses; they were concentrating their attention on more important\r\nmatters. A secretary posted them in the events to enable them to\r\ndiscuss them when necessary, to keep up the farce that they were there\r\nto watch the horses. They watched their opportunity to slip up to some\r\ngreat man and discuss some point at issue between them in a friendly\r\nand casual way. The Foreign Minister knew nothing of such manœuvres.\r\nIf he wished to discuss a delicate matter with the Ambassador of some\r\nunfriendly Power, he sought him in his Embassy and at once raised\r\nthe question to an affair of State instead of ascertaining in a\r\nnon-committal way how matters stood before formulating a demand. Count\r\nBerchtold was essentially an honest and straightforward man when he\r\ntook over the onerous duties of Foreign Minister, and had no slur\r\nupon his character. He was very loth to assume the responsibilities\r\nof office, and only accepted at the Emperor’s direct request. He felt\r\nthat he was not fit to take the helm of State at such a critical\r\nmoment. There is not the slightest doubt that the Count was correct\r\nin the estimate of his own powers. It would have required a much less\r\nsimple-minded man to guide the country through the troubled waters\r\nwhich seethed all around. The Hungarian aristocrat, perhaps more than\r\nthe Austrian noble, lives a somewhat secluded life far from railroad\r\nand market town. He is brought up in the same way as the old feudal\r\nbarons in the Middle Ages. He is surrounded by a swarm of servants,\r\nwhom he regards more in the light of serfs than free men. He fills the\r\nobligations as well as enjoys the privileges of a feudal overlord. The\r\nyoung aristocrat enjoys life. It is made up of hunting, often in the\r\nprimæval forest; he is constantly invited to shooting-parties, and\r\nspends his time in that and other manly and outdoor occupations. He is\r\nalways an expert climber, can stalk a chamois, and would never fear for\r\nhis footing on the most precipitous rocks. He can fence, box, and is,\r\nof course, an expert swordsman. He never knows when he may be called\r\nupon to fight a duel, with any weapons. He learns to speak four or\r\nfive languages from native tutors. He must be proficient in German,\r\nFrench, and, if possible, English and Italian, before he leaves the\r\nschoolroom. He acquires these languages without trouble, often from his\r\nnurses, and learns to ride while still little more than a baby. All\r\nthese accomplishments fit him to cut a figure in the fashionable world,\r\nbut form a poor equipment for battling with foreign diplomatists, who\r\nhave had the advantage of a training in a much severer school. Even if\r\nthe education, which he receives at the hands of a tutor, chosen rather\r\nfor his sporting proclivities than for his erudition, is completed by\r\na university course, no professor in Austria-Hungary would venture to\r\ndeal with a young aristocrat in the same fashion as with a student\r\nbelonging to the middle classes. Thus, although the aristocrat is\r\npeculiarly suited to occupy important positions on account of his\r\nbirth and manners, he is frequently unfit to deal with very intricate\r\nproblems or to match his wits against those of other politicians. Count\r\nBerchtold was a great favourite in Vienna because of his hospitality.\r\nThe Hungarians are known far and wide for their hearty hospitality, and\r\nhe even excelled the traditions of his race. He gave entertainments\r\nat the Ballplatz, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry, close to\r\nthe Hofburg, that were unique of their kind. He had a kindly word\r\nfor everyone who entered the vast _salles_ that opened one into the\r\nother at the top of the great marble staircase. Beneath the historic\r\nportraits he entertained Archduchess and peasant deputy with unvarying\r\naffability. When he was seen in other social centres it was always\r\nconceded that he was the most distinguished-looking man in the room.\r\nThe tall, dark figure flitted restlessly to and fro, always anxious to\r\ncontribute his part to making the entertainment a success. But close\r\nobservers noted something in the formation of the skull and the glance\r\nof the eye that denoted lack of firmness. He was a man who could be\r\npersuaded against his better judgment. Had he been called upon, like\r\nmost of his predecessors in office, to be a mere figurehead, all would\r\nhave been well, but under the actual circumstances it was fatal to the\r\npeace of Europe. It is more than probable that Berchtold was chosen to\r\nfill the important post at the suggestion of Count Tchirsky, or some\r\nother emissary of Kaiser Wilhelm, who desired to have a weak man in\r\npower in Vienna.\r\n\r\nOnce he had taken office, Count Berchtold discovered that all quiet\r\nwas at an end. There were constant attacks upon him in the German\r\nsubsidised Press of Vienna. During the long diplomatic struggles that\r\ntook place while he held office he was accused of hesitation and of\r\nvacillation. He was, however, merely trying to steer a middle course\r\nbetween the two policies dictated by the two parties within the Empire.\r\nThe Emperor was firm in his desire to die in peace. His reign had begun\r\nwith the loss of territory following upon defeat on the battlefield.\r\nIt was well known that he absolutely refused to contemplate any policy\r\nthat might lead the Empire into further hostilities. It was the Emperor\r\nwho sent the autograph letter to the Czar in the Annexation year,\r\nbegging him to allow him to go down to the grave in peace, and to\r\ndesist from a war which seemed inevitable. On the other hand, Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand was anxious for a war. He was at the head of the\r\nmilitary party, composed of the younger aristocrats, who were more or\r\nless tools in the hands of Kaiser Wilhelm. They comprehended nothing of\r\nwhat war meant at this period in the world’s history. They suspected\r\nnothing of the plans of Kaiser Wilhelm, who pushed the Emperor of\r\nAustria into the foreground when he wished the scales to be turned in\r\nfavour of peace, and skilfully brought forward the military party\r\nwhen he wished Austria-Hungary to threaten war. Count Berchtold was\r\nvery sensitive to public opinion; the attacks made upon him by the\r\nPress, hinting that he was lacking in courage, annoyed him. They also\r\nprepared public opinion for war. Austria-Hungary was depicted as the\r\nsufferer from a hundred slights--as the down-trodden country that was\r\nforced to bear all kinds of insults. Insults from Servia, insults\r\nfrom Montenegro, had been accepted lying down. All news of what the\r\nsmall Balkan States had to endure before they made the protests was,\r\nof course, suppressed. Their point of view was never considered.\r\nCaricatures of Count Berchtold, showing him on his way to Salonica but\r\nfrightened to go on by the claws of the Russian bear, were published in\r\nthe comic papers. The lengths to which these papers went in turning the\r\nForeign Minister to ridicule--a deadly crime in Austria-Hungary--was\r\nindicative of the strength of the Imperial Germans in Austria. They\r\nwere even able to protect their minions against the Austrian censor.\r\nWhen any politician showed indications of strong-mindedness and of\r\na disposition to resist German influence, the terrors of the German\r\nsubsidised Press were turned upon him. He invariably had to go. The\r\nPress in Count Berchtold’s case, however, was merely used to bring him\r\nto a sense of his own impotence and to deceive him as to the state of\r\npublic opinion. The Germans did not desire his dismissal, although they\r\nfrequently had rumours of his impending resignation published. His\r\nbeing in office suited their purpose much too well for them to wish\r\nto see him leave his place. Count Tchirsky and other pro-Prussians\r\nfilled the air with rumours of the Emperor’s inability to rule. They\r\nsaid that the old man was in his dotage. This sounded reasonable,\r\nalthough it was by no means the case. Count Berchtold was naturally\r\ninclined to believe these reports, as, although he was very loyal to\r\nhis sovereign, he, like many other men of the modern school, could\r\nnot comprehend the monarch’s peculiar idiosyncrasies, and was apt to\r\nmistake his religious fervour for an expression of feeble-mindedness.\r\nThis rendered Berchtold ready to believe the insinuations that were\r\ncunningly suggested to him that the Emperor could not be trusted with\r\nsecrets of State. He might tell all to his father-confessor, who would\r\nreport it to Rome, where the hated Italians might learn it, said the\r\nGerman diplomatists. Berchtold thus entered on a course that led to the\r\nundoing of his country. He acted without consulting the Emperor, and\r\nconcealed important facts from him at times of crisis. His tempters no\r\ndoubt showed him good and sufficient reason why he should do this. The\r\ncourse was, however, a lapse from honesty--an honesty that had been\r\nBerchtold’s chief virtue. So long as the supreme power was vested in\r\none man, that man, whatever his age, should have been in possession\r\nof the full facts of the case. The Emperor of Austria alone had to\r\ndecide whether there should be peace or war, and his Foreign Minister\r\nhad no right to deceive him on any point. Count Berchtold and the\r\nGerman Ambassador had guilty secrets between them. It was thus that\r\nthe Ambassador got his hold over the Foreign Minister and used it\r\nmercilessly. The country gentleman could not believe that the German\r\naristocrats around him were liars and were capable of acts unthought-of\r\nby persons of his simple creed.\r\n\r\nHistory will pronounce judgment on Berchtold. Contemporaries see\r\nhim as a weak man, who lost his country’s cause through a complete\r\ninability to cope with the scoundrels who surrounded him. He was unable\r\nto comprehend the peculiar art of lying that German diplomacy had\r\nbrought to a fine art, the sphinx-like promises that could be made\r\nand interpreted according to need. A man of less honourable instincts\r\nwould have been more capable of dealing with the situation; a man of\r\ncharacter might have saved his country.\r\n\r\nCount Tisza, the Hungarian Premier, was a man of iron will. He was\r\nfrequently called the Hungarian “Cromwell,” “the man with the mailed\r\nfist.” He had fought more duels than any other Hungarian aristocrat,\r\nand his courage was well proven. Not only had he physical courage,\r\nbut moral courage as well. Like Count Berchtold, he had received the\r\neducation and training of a Hungarian aristocrat. He is an autocrat of\r\nthe old school, whose strong will has never been broken by opposition.\r\nPossessed of great strength of character, but educated in an atmosphere\r\nof unreality, he had no grasp of what was really happening in Europe.\r\nTisza always prided himself on his loyalty to the Emperor. When the\r\nsovereign told him to reduce the rebellious Hungarian Parliament to\r\norder, he did not hesitate to order the soldiers to drag out offending\r\nmembers. On another occasion he had armed men placed at the entrance\r\nto the House to prevent the entrance of all refractory members. The\r\nEmperor and Tisza both looked upon the Parliament as a necessary evil\r\nthat must be dealt with in the best way circumstances allowed. Neither\r\nof them considered that the people had any rights. They were not of the\r\nsame flesh and blood as Emperors and Counts.\r\n\r\nThis autocratic idea, born of circumstances and surroundings, led both\r\nmen to act in a most tyrannous way towards the people. Tisza especially\r\nhad a profound contempt for the mob. He looked upon the subject-peoples\r\nas beneath contempt. Neither he nor his Imperial master could brook\r\nNotes send by the Serbs. It seemed to them the acme of impertinence\r\nthat a nation of so little importance should dare to address the\r\nEmperor of Austria as an equal.\r\n\r\nCount Tisza has always been most anxious to make Hungary equal to\r\nAustria. He considered that the two nations should enjoy equal rights.\r\nHe resented the fact that the Court was established at Vienna, and\r\nthat Budapesth always took a second place. Tisza and every Hungarian\r\nstatesmen knew that the common funds were spent for the benefit of\r\nAustria rather than for that of Hungary. At the same time Hungary, who\r\nclaimed equal rights with Austria, always refused to take a half of\r\nthe common expenses on her shoulders; the Hungarian share was always\r\na third, Austria paying two-thirds. Hungary is very wealthy, but\r\nhas very little ready money. Her nobles regulate taxation and take\r\ngreat care that the burden falls on the people in the way of indirect\r\ntaxation of necessities. Before the war there was no income tax in\r\nHungary, although the revenues enjoyed by the great landowners are\r\nimmense. Kaiser Wilhelm was very exactly informed of the relations\r\nbetween Austria and Hungary. He took pains to attach Tisza to his\r\nperson. Tisza was invited to Berlin frequently; he was summoned to\r\nconfer with the Kaiser constantly, while Count Berchtold was seldom\r\nconsulted. The Kaiser dazzled Tisza and the Hungarians with promises\r\nof assistance in their fight against Austria. The Kaiser seemed to be\r\nthe only man who comprehended their position. An ambitious and warlike\r\npeople, the Magyar minority could not be swamped by the Slavs within\r\nthe kingdom, or overwhelmed by the Germans in Austria. Count Tisza,\r\nalthough a very strong man, is not capable of comprehending a character\r\nlike that of Kaiser Wilhelm. Single of purpose himself, he cannot\r\ncomprehend duplicity in another. Like the Emperor Francis Joseph and\r\nCount Berchtold, he was duped. He desired to go to war with Servia\r\nbecause, like Count Berchtold, his personal vanity had been hurt. He\r\ncould not take an international view of the situation. The great Slav\r\nperil within the Empire seemed more important to him than the fear of\r\nAll-German domination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT BERCHTOLD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT TISZA.]\r\n\r\nCount Tisza might have done much to save his country from ruin;\r\ninstead, he preferred to see the subject-races oppressed. He considered\r\nthat a war that would enable the Government to thin out the Slavs, by\r\nletting them fight one against the other, the soldiers from within\r\nthe Empire against those without, would secure the supremacy of the\r\nMagyars. He failed to comprehend that the Magyars were to be thinned\r\nout in their turn to make way for Germans who wished to exploit the\r\nrich treasures of Hungary and exhaust her mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nCount Tisza was a gambler accustomed to play with gentlemen; when he\r\nplayed at statesmanship with the German Emperor he did not count upon\r\nhis adversary using loaded dice.\r\n\r\nThe very uprightness of his character prevented his suspecting others.\r\nThe man in the street suspected Kaiser Wilhelm; the Premier did not.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian aristocrat had never been “up against life”; he had no\r\ninstinct to guide him. He fondly believed that he was twisting the\r\nKaiser round his finger and using him for his own ends. These ends\r\nwere the glorification of Hungary, for Tisza is a patriot to his\r\nfinger-tips. Unfortunately, he was deeply imbued with the sentiment\r\nthat a king cannot commit meannesses. He placed the Kaiser on the same\r\nlevel as a Hungarian noble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY AS A MILITARY AND NAVAL POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Austria-Hungary, where conscription is in force, had an army\r\nof about three million men when fully mobilised. These men were of\r\nexcellent physique, since they were selected as the most promising\r\nmaterial among a number of men fit for service. Every year when the\r\nannual contingent of recruits came up for service, a larger number were\r\npassed as “fit” than could be put into training. About a third of the\r\n“fit” were sent home; they were selected by lot, and although they were\r\nnot called upon to serve immediately, they were under the obligation to\r\ndo so when required. Thus there was a large second line of untrained\r\nmen fit for service and ready to be called up when necessary. The high\r\nstandard of efficiency resulted in only the very best material being\r\nselected; there were many among the rejected who could be called to\r\nthe colours in time of necessity.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the military authorities pursued a definite policy. They\r\nwere willing to grant exemption to the city man who could be usefully\r\nemployed in clerical work in war time, and devoted their energies to\r\ntraining the peasant for actual fighting.\r\n\r\nAll this resulted in the official figures of the available men giving\r\nno real estimate of the numbers that were actually available.\r\n\r\nMuch money and attention were devoted to the minor branches of\r\nthe service. Armament factories were increased and flying fields\r\nestablished in connection with all the army corps headquarters. The\r\npreparations for a possible war, while being carried on with great\r\nenergy and at great expense, were somewhat delayed by an incurable\r\nhabit, peculiar to the Austrians, of giving great attention to branches\r\nof the service that were anything but essential. Experiments were made\r\nin ski-running on the Alps in winter. Small companies of men were\r\nfrequently lost in the Tyrol while trying to cross difficult ground.\r\nIt was felt in the country generally that the attempts to get over the\r\nglaciers and snowfields might just as well have been made in summer,\r\nwhen there was not the same danger from avalanches, and even if war\r\nwith Italy were inevitable, ski-running practised within view of the\r\nItalian frontier was not likely to calm Italian susceptibilities.\r\nAviation, which had long been recognised as the war weapon of the\r\nfuture, was quite neglected. The Government refused to purchase the\r\nnecessary airships. The Austrians, with all their mechanical genius,\r\nwere not able to make the motors for aeroplanes. Austrian inventors\r\nhad to obtain motors from France before their airships could fly. The\r\nconservatism of thought and methods which made the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment neglect the air service, led them to misread the signs of\r\nthe times, and to allow the fleet to sink to a mere nothing. Although\r\nthey were building up the fortifications along the Austro-Hungarian\r\nfrontier, a queer optimism made them count upon Italy’s help in the\r\nMediterranean. Meanwhile they worked up their land fortifications.\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian naval ports are models of what Nature can do in\r\nthe way of natural defences. Cattaro is practically impregnable from\r\nthe sea side. The gulf winds in and out, and the approach to the city\r\ncan be defended at every turn. The military and naval authorities\r\nfelt quite secure of Cattaro, and it was only in the Annexation year,\r\nwhen there was trouble with Montenegro, that it was discovered that\r\nthe cannon on the summit of Mount Lovcen could be fired right into\r\nCattaro. The boundary line between Austria-Hungary and Montenegro runs\r\nclose to the summit of the mountain. The Austrians considered that\r\nit would be very easy to capture the top of the precipitous mountain\r\nshould war break out between the small country and themselves, but it\r\nwas a very serious offset to the value of Cattaro. There was a large\r\nchoice of suitable naval ports along the coast besides Cattaro. The\r\nonly consideration that made a selection difficult was the question of\r\nrailway communications with the interior.\r\n\r\nSebenico was also built out as a naval base, but, like Cattaro, there\r\nwas no railway to connect it with the interior, as the narrow gauge\r\nBosnian railways were of little practical use for military purposes.\r\nThey were either light mountain railways or narrow gauge. This meant\r\nthat all transports must be unloaded at the Hungarian frontier. Neither\r\nCattaro nor Sebenico could thus be utilised as first-class naval bases\r\nuntil the Bosno-Herzegowinan railway system had been changed. Plans for\r\nthis project were made and the money was voted, but the work had not\r\nbeen begun at the outbreak of the Great War. The naval authorities\r\nestablished excellent wireless stations and repairing shops at these\r\nports. The Government was disinclined to spend money on these ports,\r\nbecause the population was either Italian or Serb, and not easy to cow\r\ninto subjection, like inland peoples. A seafaring people were always\r\nable to make good their escape should danger threaten. If the sea coast\r\nwere watched too carefully for them to get away by boat, there was a\r\nwild mountainous district behind, where a man could hide among the\r\nrocky crags undisturbed until the hue and cry after him had died down.\r\nJust as the Bohemians near the German frontier were always inclined to\r\nbe restive, and the Government more or less obliged to take a lenient\r\nview of their offences, so the Dalmatians were seldom subjected to\r\npersecution. Austria-Hungary never let off her wrath on those able to\r\ndefend themselves.\r\n\r\nPolitical considerations hampered the Austro-Hungarian Government in\r\nher choice of ports and in her shipbuilding. Austria wished to get all\r\nthe shipbuilding orders, and was willing to make concessions to Hungary\r\nin agricultural affairs in order to secure them. Hungary, however, was\r\nnot disposed to accept these.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary only settled upon a definite naval policy after the\r\nAnnexation crisis. It was decided then that the new boats should\r\nbe built in Trieste, and then tugged round to Pola for fitting.\r\nThe Hungarians complained bitterly, and insisted upon some orders\r\nbeing placed at Fiume also. Slips for Dreadnoughts were prepared in\r\nHungarian dockyards. The first Dreadnoughts, however, were built at the\r\nStablimento Tecnico, in Trieste. This caused a storm of indignation all\r\nalong the Adriatic. Austria had fostered Trieste at the expense of all\r\nother ports--both Hungarian and Italian--on the sea coast. Two railways\r\ncarried goods from Trieste to Vienna. Preference tariffs were given to\r\ngoods shipped over the Austrian ports. Italian firms found it cheaper\r\nto get their goods via Trieste than via Venice. Every form of ruse\r\nand trickery for magnifying the importance of Trieste and decreasing\r\nthat of Venice was used. In some cases, Austrian firms received large\r\nState subventions to enable them to undersell Italian firms. Thus\r\nTrieste absorbed much of the trade that formerly went _via_ Genoa to\r\nSwitzerland and Germany. In bolstering up Trieste and its trade the\r\nGovernment was not actuated by commercial considerations only. The\r\nmercantile fleet proved an excellent training-school for sailors;\r\nthe population was composed mostly of Italians and Slavs, seafaring\r\npeople who had been accustomed to earn their living on the water for\r\ngenerations and generations. Austria-Hungary, when contemplating her\r\nfailures in many parts of the country, could always point to Trieste\r\nas a complete success. Unfortunately, Kaiser Wilhelm also regarded the\r\nseaport as an entire success. The splendid docks, stretching miles\r\ninland, where light boats could be built, the yards at Montfalcone,\r\nall stirred a feeling of covetousness in the monarch, who was never\r\nsatisfied. He actually commenced negotiations to get possession of\r\nTrieste. He needed a port in the Mediterranean or in the Adriatic for\r\nthe re-fitting, re-fuelling, and provisioning of German ships in times\r\nof peace. Austria-Hungary refused on one occasion to cede her best port\r\nto Kaiser Wilhelm, but an agreement that Germany could use it as a\r\ncoaling-station was entered into.\r\n\r\nThe first Dreadnoughts built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy just after\r\nthe Annexation crisis were laid down secretly. Although permission to\r\nbuild Dreadnoughts had been given at the Delegations, many Members\r\nof Parliament opposed the granting of the money, on the ground that\r\nAustria-Hungary could not afford to embark on a policy that might\r\nembroil her with other nations. Her army was sufficiently large to\r\nprotect her and assure her that respect among the Great Powers that\r\nshe had a right to demand. The Government, to save argument, thus laid\r\ndown the Dreadnoughts without announcing the fact. When the news that\r\nthe first ship was partially ready and the second had already been\r\nlaid down was made public, the other nations of Europe naturally felt\r\nthat Austria-Hungary had stolen a march upon them. She specialised in\r\nbuilding submarines and torpedoes at this time. The necessary expense\r\nwas provided for by a special species of book-keeping. Money voted\r\nfor education and similar purposes was devoted to the construction of\r\nsubmarines, and the public and Europe were kept in ignorance of the\r\ntrue uses to which it was put.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, the late heir to the throne of\r\nAustria-Hungary, was especially interested in shipbuilding. He had a\r\nvalid excuse for remaining far from the capital. The fine dust from\r\nthe limestone with which Vienna is built injured his lungs, which were\r\nalready delicate. He therefore stayed for the greater part of the year\r\nat Miramare, a beautiful castle close to Trieste, or at Brioni, farther\r\nalong the coast. The Duchess and the children enjoyed the stay near\r\nthe sea. He ran to and fro in a swift yacht, visited Pola and Fiume,\r\nand assisted at the experiments which were being carried on there.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm frequently came to visit Corfu, and stayed at Miramare\r\n_en route_. The two men who were plotting for world-empire spent many\r\nhours together. The Kaiser was frequently accompanied by experts, who\r\ntravelled _incognito_ at the command of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, brought up, like all the Austro-Hungarian\r\nImperial family, in an atmosphere of unreality, suspected nothing of\r\nthe Kaiser’s ulterior motives in coming to Trieste. He even followed\r\nhis suggestions for the gradual removal of all Italians employed in\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nARCHDUKE CARL FRANCIS JOSEPH\r\n\r\n\r\nArchduke Carl Francis Joseph resembles the present Emperor of Austria\r\nand King of Hungary very closely, though the resemblance is apparent\r\nrather in a certain peculiar charm of manner than in a similarity of\r\nfeatures. Their colouring is identical, and when on the outbreak of war\r\nthe aged Emperor made a triumphal entry into Vienna amid enthusiastic\r\ncrowds such as the capital had never seen, with the heir to the throne\r\nby his side in an open carriage, everyone remarked on a resemblance\r\nthat had escaped them before. “He might be the Emperor’s grandson,”\r\nwas heard on every side, as the two men who held the destinies of the\r\nland in their hands went by. They sat stiffly upright, for both have\r\nthe carriage that marks a thorough military training; both acknowledged\r\nthe frenzied acclamations of the crowd with a truly royal reserve,\r\nin contrast with the eagerness of Ferdinand of Bulgaria or Wilhelm of\r\nPrussia, who could not conceal their extreme delight at the shouts of\r\nthe populace. Both Emperor and Archduke have always been popular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHDUKE CARL FRANCIS JOSEPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS ZITA OF PARMA.]\r\n\r\nThe Archduke had received the careful training that is given to one\r\nwho is expected to fill a high place in life. He learned English at\r\nthe same time as he learned German from an English governess, who\r\nsucceeded in implanting a love for her native land in the heart of the\r\nyoung Archduke. The Austrians considered that he was too British in his\r\ntastes in many ways, and much too inclined to go in for games of every\r\nkind instead of attending to the more serious studies that took up so\r\nlarge a part of his time already. While the young Archduke showed great\r\nenthusiasm for tennis, for dancing and skating, he cared but little for\r\nabstruse studies. None of the Habsburgs ever gave evidence of great\r\nmental powers, and the Archduke was true to the family traditions in\r\nthis respect. Educated in Vienna, where dancing and music are regarded\r\nas the chief end of life, it was natural that he should enjoy both. It\r\nis also a debatable point whether accomplishments of this kind are not\r\nmore desirable for the young man who wishes to get into touch with his\r\nsubjects and with foreign diplomatists than a taste for discussion.\r\nUnfortunately, the Archduke was encouraged to pursue a very frivolous\r\nlife. The wicked uncle of the fairy tale is frequently seen in real\r\nlife. In this case he enjoyed unusual powers. When Archduke Otto died\r\nhe left his brother, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, guardian to his two\r\nboys. The heir to the throne and his ambitious morganatic wife thus\r\nhad the care of educating the boy who was to succeed to the throne\r\ninstead of their own boys. It is doubtful whether they could have felt\r\nkindly towards him in any case. Being what they were, both ambitious\r\nand unscrupulous, they did everything they could to ruin the boy. He\r\nwas surrounded by persons who turned his thoughts towards subjects\r\nunfit for him, and who led him astray at an age when he should have\r\nbeen attending to his schoolbooks. The sudden change from a life of\r\nconvent-like severity to one of the greatest dissipation and licence\r\nwas sufficient to turn the head of any young man, and much more so that\r\nof the heir-presumptive to a brilliant throne. When he appeared in a\r\nballroom the women flattered him, not for position perhaps so much as\r\nfor his youthful grace and manners. The Archduke and his wife threw\r\nin the way of the Archduke people of vicious life, who did their best\r\nto ruin him in every way. The frivolity of his disposition, mingled\r\nwith a certain lightheartedness that led him to take nothing seriously,\r\nsaved him from these snares. The Archduke had him removed from the\r\nVienna Court, where he was far too popular, on the pretext that he was\r\n“going the pace” too fast. The Emperor made inquiries, and discovered\r\nthat the Archduke was leading a comparatively simple life compared\r\nwith that of many of his elders. He was banished to his regiment\r\ngarrisoned on the Elbe; however, he got frequent leave to come to\r\nVienna _incognito_, when he could not interfere with his uncle, who was\r\nso unpopular that he never ventured to walk about the streets like the\r\nrest of the Imperial family. It is probable that, instead of lessening\r\nhis popularity, these long periods of enforced absence endeared the\r\nyoung Archduke to the hearts of his future subjects. He, too, knew\r\nhow to speak a number of languages and dialects. Italian he spoke\r\nlike his native tongue, and he knew French, the diplomatic language\r\nof the Balkans, thoroughly. He knew Czech really well, and also spoke\r\nHungarian, having learnt both languages as a child. The heir to the\r\nthrone knew neither, not having learnt them when young, as there were\r\nseveral lives between him and the throne. All these facts made him less\r\ninclined to love his nephew, who seemed to possess all the graces that\r\nhe lacked. All the machinations against him, although actuated by the\r\ndeepest hate, had no result because of his simplicity of character.\r\nWhen he returned to Vienna after a long, enforced absence, he went at\r\nonce to the Belvedere and thanked his uncle and aunt for the kind care\r\nthat held him far from the capital. He did not say that he had all the\r\namusement that he needed. He had been present at every _première_ of\r\nimportance, assisted at many balls that did not figure in the columns\r\nof the papers devoted to Court news, and generally had an amusing\r\ntime without being trammelled by the strict etiquette that would have\r\nregulated his movements had he been in the capital on an official\r\nvisit. Always smiling and good-humoured, he never even noticed the\r\nmachinations that were directed against him. He was high in favour\r\nwith the Emperor, who often expressed the wish that the younger man\r\nwere coming to the throne instead of the next heir, for Archduke Carl\r\nhad never caused him a moment’s uneasiness. This was saying much at a\r\nCourt where most of the youthful members had committed some breach\r\nof etiquette at least, many of them having caused the Emperor much\r\ntrouble by their love affairs. Archduke Carl, instead of a variety of\r\n_affaires_, had offered all the warmth of his youthful devotion on the\r\nshrine of one of the most amusing and accomplished Vienna actresses.\r\nHe carried flowers and flung them on the stage at her feet very often,\r\nand showed his preference in many ways. As the lady was already a woman\r\nfar on in years, she accepted his boyish devotion without allowing him\r\nto do anything compromising for his future. She acted the _rôle_ of\r\nthe good fairy who saved the prince from all the snares spread for his\r\nundoing. When the Archduke fell in love with an old playmate at a Court\r\nball, he made his actress friend his first _confidante_. The Archduke,\r\nlike most of his relations, married solely for love, and was able to\r\naccomplish his desire, although there was much opposition in some\r\nquarters. Princess Zita, of Parma, the daughter of an old and decaying\r\nrace, was a child of the Vienna Court. She had been convent-bred, and,\r\nlike her husband, she was educated partly on English lines. She had\r\nspent some years at the convent at the Isle of Wight, where several of\r\nher near relatives occupy important positions among the Sisters. She\r\nlives part of the year in Italy, and is essentially Italian in type and\r\ncharacter. Her great charm of manner fitted her to become an Empress;\r\nthe only objection that could be made to the match was that she came\r\nof a family of worn-out stock already related to the Habsburgs, and\r\nnot likely to improve that degenerate line. This objection would have\r\nbeen considered fatal at some Courts. At Vienna the fact that Princess\r\nZita was distinguished for her piety and was completely in the hands\r\nof the Church over-rode all other considerations, and the match was\r\nallowed to proceed. It has turned out most happily. The Viennese were\r\npleased to have a Princess that they knew. They made no secret of the\r\nfact that it was a grave mistake to import princesses. They said that\r\nsuch young women did not know enough to hold their own against the\r\nintrigues of the family, who were invariably jealous of the “first lady\r\nat the Court.” The women did their best to poison the young lives of\r\nimported princesses with tales of scandal and by other less reputable\r\nmeans. Princess Zita had a crowd of powerful relations to stand by her\r\nand protect her from the harm that befell the late Empress Elizabeth.\r\nShe was well acquainted with the atmosphere of the Court, and, like\r\na child at home, knew how to avoid all the pitfalls spread for her\r\nundoing. Princess Zita accompanied her husband everywhere when it was\r\npossible. Before the war she travelled over the whole of the Galician\r\nfrontier in his company. With deep understanding of the character of\r\nthe peasants, she purchased their livestock at the exorbitant prices\r\nthey demanded for her poultry farm. Unlike Duchess Hohenberg, who\r\ncomplained that she was overcharged when the peasants asked too much,\r\nshe threw away sums of money, small intrinsically, but large in the\r\neyes of the poor inhabitants of the land. The progress made by the\r\nnewly-married pair was a great success. The birth of a son, while\r\nputting a seal upon the popularity of both, undid the hopes and plans\r\nnourished at the Belvedere. Duchess Hohenberg despaired of seeing\r\neither of her fine boys upon the throne. The remainder of the Court\r\nheld a brief for Archduke Carl and Princess Zita, and protected them\r\nagainst Duchess Hohenberg. Little Zita had grown up among them, and no\r\none grudged her the high place she occupied. She did not even displace\r\nthe “first lady of the Court.” Archduchess Annunziata, the niece of the\r\nEmperor, immediately resigned her place to the younger woman who was\r\nto be the future Empress, but the little Princess was too much taken\r\nup by her duties as mother to learn the whole of the strict etiquette\r\nthat the “first lady” is called upon to observe. Her aunt arranged,\r\ntherefore, to preside at the more formal functions, where the Princess,\r\nwho was nothing but a child, might make some dreadful mistake, and\r\nto instruct her gradually. This simplified matters greatly for the\r\nPrincess, who thus made no enemies. Archduchess Annunziata had presided\r\nat the Court ever since the tragic death of Empress Elizabeth. She was\r\ntired of the burden, and wished to retire to her convent at Prague\r\nfor the remainder of her life. She took no pleasure in standing erect\r\nand gracious on a platform at the top of the ballroom and saying the\r\nappropriate thing to each of the dignitaries presented to her notice.\r\nThe _rôle_ that would have rejoiced Duchess Hohenberg beyond everything\r\nannoyed her.\r\n\r\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand and Duchess Hohenberg, sitting sullen and\r\ngloomy at Konopischt, still tried to keep the heir-presumptive far from\r\nthe capital. He and Princess Zita were only allowed to show themselves\r\npublicly in Vienna on rare occasions. This led to their being cheered\r\nfrantically whenever they did show themselves. Exaggerated stories\r\nof the jealousy shown by the Archduke went all round the city. The\r\nEmperor frequently called the younger man to his side, and was struck\r\nby his modesty and mild demeanour. Archduke Carl was naturally most\r\nunassuming. His personal attendants were much attached to him because\r\nof his great generosity, but always said that he was impulsive to a\r\ndegree that made him difficult to arrange for; he made plans absolutely\r\nupon the spur of the moment without stopping to consider.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young Archduke as he was known in Vienna when the\r\nmurder of Sarajevo altered the entire course of his life. The weight\r\nof responsibility suddenly thrown upon his shoulders made him show\r\ncharacter--strength of character that must have been there all the\r\ntime, carefully concealed beneath the pleasant manners of a young\r\ncourtier. This was seen at the funeral of the victims of Sarajevo. He\r\ninsisted upon walking behind the funeral coach that bore his uncle and\r\naunt to their last rest. The Master of the Ceremonies at the Vienna\r\nCourt had arranged that no member of the House of Habsburg should\r\ndemean himself by paying this respect to the dead, and he represented\r\nthis to the Archduke on the steps of the railway station. The Archduke\r\nbecame quite red in the face with excitement as he pointed out to the\r\namazed official that he was now heir to the throne, and that he would\r\ndecide upon what was the correct thing at Court. All Vienna saw and\r\napplauded. He walked alone behind the coffins as first mourner with the\r\nair of sadness and solemnity which the occasion demanded. At the same\r\ntime he freed himself from the domination of the much-dreaded Master of\r\nthe Ceremonies once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke and his wife were naturally pro-Italian. Even before his\r\nmarriage the Archduke had always shown more sympathy for the Italians\r\nthan was felt by other Habsburgs. The happiest days of his life had\r\nbeen spent on Italian ground at Viareggio, where he was able to live on\r\nthe water far away from the Court and its exigencies. He was inclined\r\nto trust the Italians, and, unlike his uncle, disliked the Slavs. He\r\nwas, too, decidedly pro-British before the war. When he was selected to\r\ngo to England to represent the Emperor, he made his preparations with\r\nthe greatest alacrity, pleased to think that he had been chosen for the\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm regarded the heir-presumptive to the throne as a young\r\nman of no importance in his schemes. He believed that a youth who\r\nwas so thoroughly under the influence of his mother had neither the\r\ncharacter nor the intelligence to oppose his plans. Kaiser Wilhelm,\r\nperhaps, neglected that obstinacy which is a leading characteristic\r\nof the Habsburgs, and which has enabled them to resist many an attack\r\nupon their prerogative in the past, and may have an important and\r\nunexpected influence on the future. While the late heir to the throne\r\nof Austria-Hungary was entirely in the hands of the Jesuits, neither\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph nor his present heir ever allowed them to\r\ndictate in affairs of State. They held that religion and statecraft\r\nwere different matters that must be kept scrupulously apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY FACED BY REVOLUTION OR WAR--THE FINANCIAL FACTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria and Hungary strike the casual visitor as very like any other\r\nEuropean country, and so long as he remains on the beaten path he\r\nfinds no reason to revise his judgment. Vienna, Budapesth, Prague, are\r\nvery like Milan or Berlin. There is plenty of ready money, and every\r\nindication of a somewhat too advanced civilisation. In fact, decadence\r\nis suggested rather than under-cultivation. The ease with which the\r\ncity people have adopted every new invention, and the facility with\r\nwhich they adapt themselves to modern appliances and conveniences,\r\nquite deceives the stranger. He naturally supposes that people who\r\nmade constant and excellent use of the telephone at a time when it\r\nwas just being introduced into the western countries of Europe are\r\nnecessarily advanced in other matters. Everything looks very up to\r\ndate. The fashionable watering-places, like Karlsbad and Marienbad,\r\nare the essence of modernity. Everything is carefully arranged for the\r\ncomfort of the traveller, and for the man who can afford the utmost\r\nrefinement of comfort it is perfection. If he takes a long walk out\r\nfrom his splendidly appointed hotel, and spends a day or two up country\r\nin Bohemia, he will soon discover a different state of things.\r\n\r\nThe first shock is the knowledge that the forest is not safe for anyone\r\nwho rashly wanders away from carefully tended paths and marked trees\r\nthat show the direction. These immense woods are not merely unsafe,\r\nbut any stranger to the district who strays among the denser parts\r\nwill probably not return, for the peasants are inclined to be savage.\r\nIf a German falls into the hands of Czechs in a small Bohemian town\r\nhe usually gets badly mauled before the police, who are really in\r\nsympathy with the towns-people and do not hurry unduly, can interfere.\r\nThis kind of outrage, which may be found chronicled without any\r\nexcuse or explanation in the small local papers, goes on within a few\r\nmiles of the ultra-civilised Marienbad, where urbane and polished\r\npoliticians conferred with King Edward, and spoke of their land as one\r\nof the civilised countries of Europe. No one ever thought of pushing\r\ninquiries as to what the native peasant was like. Horrible crimes are\r\nfrequently reported from Bohemia, but they attract little attention.\r\nThe foreigners do not read the kind of paper that delights in horrible\r\ndetail, while the Viennese know too well how very backward much of the\r\ncountry population is, and naturally wish to keep the knowledge from\r\nthe world. The various races that live within the confines of Austria\r\nproper are of mild and somewhat timid disposition, but the Hungarians\r\nare fierce and cruel.\r\n\r\nMany peasants, who own considerable wealth in the shape of land, that\r\nhas come down to them from their fathers, have never seen a gold coin,\r\nnor even possessed a 15s. banknote in their lives. Very little gold\r\ncirculates in Austria or Hungary at any time, the people preferring\r\nnotes. Apart from this, however, many peasants never handle money.\r\nTheir whole business is carried on by barter. A peculiar method\r\nof trading is known as “pauschal.” It is extremely simple in its\r\noperation. A dairy-farmer undertakes to supply one of his neighbours\r\nwith butter, milk and eggs all the year round. The neighbour supplies\r\nhim with pork, vegetables, or some other commodity that he has at his\r\ndisposal. The same method of barter is applied to the shoemaker and\r\nto the weaver of linen. If one party suffers a slight disadvantage\r\nthrough the arrangement it is considered that it will be made up\r\nanother season, when his requirements will be larger. This system\r\nobviates any keeping of accounts, and is of great convenience, as\r\nit enables the parties concerned to forecast their expenses for the\r\ncoming year with certainty. In some districts, where there is less\r\nmutual dependence, and therefore less mutual trust and confidence,\r\nthe accounts are chalked up behind the door, and one supply of goods\r\nrendered against another. But no money passes from hand to hand. The\r\npeasant has a lively distrust of banks, born of experience; and he\r\nconsiders that the natural end of a bank is failure. He therefore\r\ninvests his money in stock, in enriching the land, if he is the\r\nabsolute proprietor, and always locks up a certain sum for emergencies,\r\nturning it into jewellery, which is worn by the women. In times of\r\nterror the peasant girl conceals her necklace--usually made of coins\r\nwhich are out of circulation--and always has the wherewithal to procure\r\nherself temporary shelter. The peasant women, too, wear belts of\r\nsolid silver, which can be converted into cash at a moment’s notice,\r\nshould necessity arise. The peasant never interferes with his wife’s\r\njewellery, whatever may be his need; it is her dowry for herself and\r\nher children in times of dire distress.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances and habits account for the curious phenomenon of a\r\npopulation rich in property, but having no ready money. This explains,\r\ntoo, the remarkable fact that only about 4 per cent. of the population\r\nof Austria pay income-tax. The tax is imposed upon everyone earning\r\nover £50 per annum. Moving about among the peasant proprietors, among\r\nthe large population engaged in cottage industries, it is impossible to\r\nbelieve that these people are living on incomes below £50 per annum.\r\nIt is true that they have no money, or only rare coins, but they are\r\nliving at a high standard of comfort, and many who earn £20 per annum\r\nin actual coins, consume products got upon the exchange and barter\r\nsystem worth several hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\nThe small fraction of the population which is taxed for income for\r\ncarrying on a trade or profession, and in a dozen other vexatious ways,\r\nis heavily hampered. A man must even pay a heavy tax for the upkeep\r\nof his religion if he is a non-Catholic. Indeed, it is difficult to\r\nsee how any business can be made to pay with the heavy taxation that\r\nhampers trade on every hand, and practically prevents Austrian traders\r\nfrom being able to compete with German firms, which instead of being\r\nhampered are assisted by their Government.\r\n\r\nIn the days of quiet and calm before Austria-Hungary was led to think\r\nof world-empire by her ambitious ally, the Minister of Finance actually\r\nturned out budgets without a deficit; some years there was even a\r\nsurplus. It was, of course, impossible to ascertain how far these\r\nfigures corresponded with actual facts, for “double book-keeping” was\r\nnot peculiar to private persons in Austria-Hungary. It was a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that Government statistics were manipulated to suit\r\nthe requirements of the political situation.\r\n\r\nWhen the country embarked upon her new military and naval policy,\r\nlarge sums of money were needed. There were meetings between leading\r\nfinanciers to consider how best it could be collected from a country\r\nthat possessed no liquid wealth. Taxes were clapped on imports.\r\nThis brought but little revenue, as the country people fed on the\r\nproducts of their own growing. The various State monopolies, such as\r\ntobacco, brought in large revenues. The attempt to get money from\r\nthe agricultural population, however, failed. This meant that the\r\ncapitals and large manufacturing districts must find the necessary\r\nfunds for reckless expenditure on armaments. Great hardships resulted.\r\nThe working-classes were forced to pay heavy taxes upon all goods\r\nentering the city. They already bore heavy import duties, and the\r\ncost of many articles of necessity was almost prohibitive. Sugar,\r\nwhich was made from beetroot in the country, and sold to England\r\nat less than cost price, in order to gain a foreign market, cost\r\n5d. a pound in Austria-Hungary. The taxation became heavier every\r\nyear, and the authorities failed to see that the burden was falling\r\nexclusively upon the middle-classes and the working-classes dwelling\r\nin the large cities. Austria-Hungary tried to float loans in France.\r\nThe political situation was so strained that, although France was\r\nwilling to lend money to Russia, she refused, point-blank, to lend\r\nto Austria or to Hungary on any terms. The loans had to be taken up\r\nin Germany. Germany needed money herself; she had been spending all\r\nher available capital upon raw material for the forging of cannon. At\r\nevery meeting of the Austrian Parliament members protested against\r\nthe laying down of Dreadnoughts when the financial situation of the\r\ncountry was so precarious. There were constant riots in the towns,\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian system of reckless suppression of disorders\r\napplied to quell the disorders only increased the mass of discontent\r\nand disaffection. There came a time when politicians began to see\r\nthat only a successful war could save the position. The Hungarians\r\nwere threatening to break loose from Austria. They considered that\r\nthe finances were mismanaged. Too much of the money voted for the\r\nDual Monarchy, and administered by the Common Minister of Finance,\r\nwas devoted to Austrian needs, to the disadvantage and detriment\r\nof her less powerful neighbour, Hungary. Such suspicions were very\r\nwell founded, especially as regards the sums secretly devoted to war\r\nmaterial. If education were defective in Austria, it was still more\r\nneglected in Hungary.\r\n\r\nVienna had become the real capital, Budapesth being neglected through\r\nthe ill-health and advancing age of the Emperor. It was clear that the\r\nEmperor could not travel to Budapesth without risk to his health, since\r\nthe climate did not suit him.\r\n\r\nHungary said that she would prefer to administer her own finances. She\r\ncould very well provide for her own military and naval requirements.\r\nShe wished to take a part of the executive power into her own hands.\r\nThis would have weakened Austria considerably. Instead of ranking as\r\na first-class Power she would fall to the rank of a secondary one.\r\nBohemia, too, wished for separation. She felt that her prosperous\r\nfactories, her ironworks, were contributing a very large share of\r\nwealth to the country, and that while the Bohemians were heavily taxed,\r\nthey got no compensation for the extra money that they poured into the\r\nState chest.\r\n\r\nThe leading statesmen realised towards the year 1912 that they were\r\nfaced by the choice of war or revolution in Austria-Hungary. The\r\nhuge sums needed to pay off the debts already incurred by the costs\r\nconnected with two mobilisations, and the ever-increasing military and\r\nnaval needs were landing the country in an _impasse_ from which there\r\nwere only two roads of escape. If the House of Habsburg wished to\r\nmaintain its proud position some action must be taken. The politicians\r\nround the throne thought that a successful war with Italy would be\r\nthe most desirable event. They dared not moot this question in the\r\npresence of the aged Emperor. He was firm for peace. This conviction,\r\nthat was deeply rooted in his mind, was strengthened by his growing\r\nparsimoniousness. Very generous as a young man, he had grown almost\r\nmiserly as old age crept upon him. When he was ill he regretted that\r\nthere should be speculation upon the Stock Exchange, and that the “poor\r\npeople should lose their money,” to use his own words. This economy,\r\nwhich he wished to see exercised, not only in his own private affairs,\r\nbut throughout the State, would alone have made him abhor the thought\r\nof war, which he knew meant expenditure. The military party hoped that\r\nhe might either die, or be brought to see that his remaining at the\r\nhead of affairs any longer was a mistake from every point of view.\r\nThey realised that something must be done. If the Emperor would only\r\nabdicate, they could act.\r\n\r\nPrices of ordinary necessities rose 30 per cent. during the three years\r\npreceding the war. The small clerk, the officer, and everyone with a\r\nlimited income and a certain position to keep up, was reduced to going\r\nwithout many articles of prime necessity, or to getting into debt. Many\r\nchose this last alternative; especially was this the case with the\r\nofficers, who were thus the more anxious for war, as they had nothing\r\nto lose and much to gain by being on active service.\r\n\r\nIf the middle classes in Austria-Hungary had possessed large sums\r\ninvested in stocks and shares, like the French or the Swiss, the large\r\nclass representing this interest would have objected to war. This was\r\nnot the case, as all speculation and almost all liquid capital was in\r\nthe hands of the Jews. They were firm for peace. They completely failed\r\nto see where the policy of the country was leading. Their lack of\r\ninfluence, and the barrier that kept them from being able to exchange\r\nviews and opinions freely and as man to man with the aristocrats,\r\nprevented them from seeing what was about to happen. They believed\r\nthat the country might go on in its peaceful way, even after the death\r\nof the Emperor, which was the date commonly fixed in the country for\r\nthe disruption of the Empire. Perhaps the Jews and the financial\r\nsection would have been right in their estimate had it not been for the\r\nambitions of the German Kaiser. They did not appreciate the mentality\r\nof the Austrian Imperial family, in whom the power of decision was\r\nreally vested, and could not understand that it would prefer to allow\r\nitself to become the cats-paw of Germany, rather than see its power\r\ndiminished by the loss of part of its lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Constitution exists on paper, but that is all.\r\nThe Austrian Parliament met at Vienna, the Hungarian Parliament still\r\nmeets at Budapesth, but the National Assemblies never exercised any\r\nactual power. This was partly due to the clever management of those in\r\nauthority, but chiefly to the policy of the Emperor, an old autocrat,\r\nwho considered that all means were justifiable if all real power could\r\nbe kept in his hands. Much of the blame, however, was due to the people\r\nthemselves, who held aloof from politics. Some of the most highly\r\neducated men in the country said that the Constitution was a farce, and\r\nthat they refused to have anything to do with it. Others refused to\r\nvote to mark their disapprobation. The Government thereupon made voting\r\nobligatory. Anyone who refused to record his vote without due cause was\r\nliable to fine and imprisonment. Thus the Government kept up the farce\r\nof a constitutional system.\r\n\r\nReflecting people of all nationalities within the Dual Monarchy\r\nrealised that the people had no power. All decisions in the realm of\r\nthe foreign policy of the country were made by the reigning monarch.\r\nNo Minister was held responsible. The power of voting money for the\r\narmy and navy and all objects common to Austria and Hungary was not\r\ninvested in the Parliaments, but held by the Delegations. The Delegates\r\nwere elected by the Parliaments, but the nominations were made by\r\nGovernment, and men noted for their pliability were selected. Delegates\r\nsometimes protested against expenditure. An instance of this kind\r\noccurred when Austria-Hungary embarked upon her big fleet policy. Money\r\nwas asked for to build Dreadnoughts. The Delegations refused.\r\n\r\nThe Government did not give up its project. It gave orders to the\r\nStablimento Tecnico in Trieste to lay down the first ship “on spec.,”\r\nwith a very broad hint as to who would purchase the vessel when\r\ncomplete. This dishonesty, first towards the taxpayers, then towards\r\nEurope, is a particularly striking sample of the policy carried on by\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament in both Austria and Hungary received payment\r\nfor each day’s attendance. When Parliament was dissolved this payment\r\nceased. The members were, for the most part, men who required the\r\nmoney to live. They had given up their profession to come to Vienna to\r\nrepresent their constituencies, and the closing of Parliament meant the\r\ncutting off of their incomes. It was therefore to their interest to do\r\nnothing to anger the Government. The laws of the Constitution provided\r\nfor the election of another Parliament, but in actual practice it\r\nremained shut until it pleased the Emperor to permit another election\r\nto take place. Persons of importance did not seek election to the\r\n“Punch and Judy” show or madhouse on the Ringstrasse, as the Austrian\r\nParliament was usually called.\r\n\r\nA stormy sitting at the Vienna Parliament was an interesting sight. A\r\ncordon of police usually guarded the stately block of buildings when\r\na row was going on within. From time to time a side door would open\r\nand angry attendants would throw out a dozen men, panting from the\r\nstruggle. They would fall on the soft carpet of snow, and then be sent\r\nabout their business by the police beyond. They were the public who\r\nhad been sitting in the gallery and who had joined too loudly in the\r\ndemonstrations going on below. Inside the atmosphere was thick. The\r\nParliament had been sitting for two days and nights unceasingly. The\r\nCzechs, who wished to obstruct the passing of a Bill, had been behaving\r\nlike buffoons. They rattled their desks and banged the lids to drown\r\nthe speaker’s voice. They brought all kinds of noisy instruments to\r\ndisturb the deliberations. Rain-machines, used in theatres to imitate\r\nthe sound of rain on the roofs, were rattled; other members blew upon\r\ntrumpets and penny whistles. Czechs of huge build spoke for ten hours\r\nat a time. Friends supplied them with water and chocolate while they\r\ncarried on their obstruction. At night the Opposition slept in the\r\npassages upon mattresses. Rolled in top-coats, they were ready to\r\nswarm in whenever their services were required at a moment’s notice.\r\nThe attendants smiled at the heaps of bodies lying prone, but ready to\r\nfight. The floor of the Parliament was untidy. Balls of paper soaked in\r\nink that had been flung at an opponent or at the President were seen on\r\nthe floor. All kinds of missiles lay thick, for the attendants, careful\r\nof their personal safety, had not ventured to pick them up. It was\r\ndifficult to realise that the Austrian Parliament was not a third-rate\r\ntavern.\r\n\r\nYear after year the Parliament spent the precious hours that should\r\nhave been given to making its voice heard in the country to this kind\r\nof foolishness. The Opposition, instead of securing a majority, always\r\nhoped to delay business and thus secure concessions that the majority\r\nwas unwilling to grant. They did not see that they were playing the\r\ngame of the Central Administration, which rejoiced to see them making\r\nthemselves ridiculous and losing such influence as they possessed by\r\nvirtue of their office.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary things were worse than in Austria. The elections were\r\nnothing more than a farce. There was no secret ballot. Votes were\r\nopenly bought and sold. When the Government could not secure a majority\r\nfor its candidate, soldiers were used to keep the Opposition voters\r\nfrom the booths. The Hungarians clamoured for general suffrage and the\r\nremoval of the property qualification, which kept the election in the\r\nhands of a few men, but they asked in vain. Their country districts\r\nwere represented by Government candidates, and even in the towns it was\r\nseldom that an independent candidate of any standing got in.\r\n\r\nThe disorders were even worse than in the Vienna Parliament. The\r\nPresident, Count Tisza, thought nothing of clearing the House with\r\nsoldiers, and had the members chased into the street at the point\r\nof the bayonet. The members were constantly sending challenges and\r\nfighting duels among themselves instead of attending to business.\r\n\r\nThe Government delegated large powers to the local Diets, which decided\r\nquestions of expenditure, and, upon the whole, acquitted themselves\r\nof their tasks in a very satisfactory manner. Unfortunately, much of\r\nthe money that was granted for local purposes remained unspent, as the\r\npermission required for liquidating the sums did not come from the\r\nCentral Government. If a road were required for military purposes or\r\na railway needed for the transport of troops, the Central Government\r\nmade a handsome contribution to the cost; if it were simply required\r\nfor the development of the country generally, the project was not\r\nencouraged. When the Diets ventured into the realms of politics they\r\nwere promptly informed that they must keep within the limits of their\r\nown jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe central authorities in Vienna and Budapesth had for years followed\r\na policy of blinding the people; they had encouraged frivolity in every\r\nform. Everything was done to turn people’s minds from serious subjects\r\nto pleasure and enjoyment. The reputation enjoyed by both Vienna and\r\nBudapesth as the gayest capitals in Europe was fully deserved. The\r\nintellectual Classes were completely hoodwinked, and had no idea of\r\nwhat was really going on, either at home or abroad. The same results\r\nwere accomplished in the country by keeping the people in ignorance\r\nand withholding education from them. While much money was spent on the\r\neducation of Germans and Magyars, the ruling races, great economy was\r\npractised towards the Slavs. The powerful Bohemians managed to secure\r\neducation for their children, and the Government statistics show that\r\n100 per cent. of the children of school age in Bohemia actually were in\r\nattendance at school in 1906. In Galicia only 85 per cent. are reported\r\nas in attendance; while in Croatia 68 per cent. went to school, and\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegowina only 14 per cent. In every case the local\r\nauthorities were forced to provide education for the children, unless\r\nthey lived on isolated farms where it was really impossible. The\r\nGovernment, however, refused its grants wherever it could, as the\r\nmoney was needed for purposes which did not appear in the Budget. The\r\nSlavs and Croats protested bitterly against a system which inflicted\r\nupon them heavy taxes, mostly indirect, and kept the benefits for the\r\nruling races. This maladministration was one of the chief causes of the\r\ncontinual unrest among the subject-peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, and indeed all the members of the Imperial family, lived\r\nin an atmosphere apart. They never considered whither their policy was\r\nleading, nor that the system of suppression could not be carried on\r\nindefinitely at this period of history. Most of the men in power would\r\nhave shone in the Middle Ages; they were useless and impracticable now\r\nthat commercial travellers have taken the places of knights-errant and\r\ntrade is more important than armaments. They did not realise that in\r\nsuppressing progress they were handicapping the country in its race\r\nfor commercial supremacy and preventing its being able to compete with\r\nGermany at home and abroad. In their fear of the “people” getting to\r\nthe fore, they neglected the foe beyond the frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nWHO MURDERED THE ARCHDUKE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constant friction between Emperor Francis Joseph and his heir was\r\nalways increased when the autumn manœuvres came round. The Emperor, who\r\nwas over eighty, wished to attend them, and on two occasions they had\r\nto be put off, as the doctors said that the monarch could not spend\r\nhis nights sleeping in a tent. Archduke Francis Ferdinand was always\r\ntoo ready to take up the duties which would have been performed by\r\nthe Emperor had he been younger. Thus the hatred between the reigning\r\nmonarch and his heir increased every year. The Emperor was prepared to\r\nallow his heir a large sum of money if he would consent to resign his\r\nright to the throne. This was not because of his personal antipathy.\r\nThe doctors who attended the Archduke said that he was not entirely\r\nresponsible for his actions. They suspected that he had an abscess on\r\nthe brain. He had committed hasty, ill-considered actions that could\r\nbe pardoned in an Archduke, but that were not possible for an Emperor,\r\nwho must always keep his temper. The Imperial family dreaded the time\r\nof his coming to the throne. They had notified the Emperor that they\r\nwould withdraw from the Court if Duchess Hohenberg were made Empress.\r\nAt that epoch no one doubted that the Archduke would create her Empress\r\nof Austria and Queen of Hungary on his accession.\r\n\r\nThe manœuvres in Bosnia--arranged to take place there because the\r\npeoples of the newly-annexed provinces had been somewhat restless--were\r\nabout to take place. Archduke Francis Ferdinand decided to assist. His\r\nwife said that she would accompany him. The Emperor was very angry. He\r\ndid not wish the Archduke to go to Bosnia. He was much too unpopular\r\nto take such a risk. When Emperor Francis Joseph heard that Duchess\r\nHohenberg was to accompany her husband, his wrath knew no bounds. The\r\nladies of the Imperial family never accompanied their husbands on such\r\noccasions. If the Archduke and his wife went to Bosnia she would be\r\nreceived as the future Empress of Austria. The Emperor forbade him to\r\ntake her. The Archduke insisted. If there was any danger, his wife, who\r\nwas really courageous, would wish to be at his side. The Emperor, who\r\nwas very jealous about his authority, was extremely angry. It is very\r\nprobable that he did not hide his feelings from his near relations.\r\n\r\nThe next news that reached Vienna was that the Archduke and his wife\r\nhad been assassinated at Sarajevo. The crime was committed on a Sunday.\r\nIt was midsummer in Vienna, and, strange to say, every important\r\npersonage was on the spot. As a rule, the official personages left\r\nVienna on the Saturday, when there were two consecutive holidays, as\r\nin this case, the Monday being a _fête_-day, and spent the week-end\r\nat the Semmering. On this particular occasion everyone was in Vienna.\r\nThe Emperor was at Ischl. The telegram with the news was sent there\r\nfirst. He exclaimed, “What impertinence of those Bosnians!” but was not\r\notherwise moved.\r\n\r\nThe official account of the assassination, which was full of\r\ndiscrepancies, was then sent to Vienna. According to this account, a\r\nbomb had been thrown at the Archduke and his wife on their way to the\r\nSarajevo town-hall. It had failed to kill them. The Archduke, little\r\nmoved by the occurrence, merely taunted the Mayor of Sarajevo with the\r\nlack of courtesy that the people had shown. “Instead of presenting us\r\nwith bouquets, you receive us with bombs.” The Archduke could afford\r\nto make merry over his escape. He naturally expected that the streets\r\nhad been cleared of people during his long visit to the town-hall. It\r\nwas a matter of elementary precaution. The Bosnian police, however,\r\nhad received instructions from Vienna that the Archduke’s safety was\r\nto be left in the hands of the military. The Archduke and his wife\r\nentered the car. The driver started off. He was in the plot. He drove\r\nthem right across the road to where the murderer was waiting. This\r\nmeant running the car on the wrong side of the road. Everyone noticed\r\nthis, but no one protested. No one seized the assassin after he had\r\nfired at the Archduke’s head. He had ample time to kill the wife too.\r\nThe boy, too, knew a secret that was carefully kept in the Imperial\r\nfamily. Archduke Francis Ferdinand was wearing armour. For this reason\r\nthe assassins tried to kill him with a bomb. This attempt having\r\nfailed, the assassin fired at his head instead of at his breast.\r\nBoth Kaiser Wilhelm and Archduke Francis Ferdinand spent much time\r\nand thought in trying to find bullet-proof armour. At the time of the\r\nassassination the Archduke was wearing a silken vest an inch thick. It\r\nwas woven obliquely--made on the same principle as the jackets used\r\nfor automobile tyres. It was warranted to turn the point of a knife\r\nor bullet. The vest was cumbersome and somewhat warm. It gave the\r\nArchduke an appearance of extreme stoutness. He, however, knowing how\r\nintensely he was hated in Austria and Hungary, never cared to appear in\r\npublic without some protective armour. Steel corselets were excellent\r\nin bygone days, but are no use against a modern rifle. The Archduke\r\nfeared he might be shot from a window. The secret that the Archduke was\r\nwearing armour was known to half-a-dozen people at most. The assassin\r\nmust have learnt it from a member of the Imperial family.\r\n\r\nA number of reporters started for Sarajevo that night to find out what\r\nhad really happened there on that dark Sunday. They were turned back\r\nby the police. All letters from individuals in Sarajevo were censored.\r\nThe telegraphic service was suspended. The police were never even\r\nreprimanded for allowing the heir to the throne to be assassinated. On\r\nthe contrary, the heads of the force were promoted shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna the news was received with ill-concealed satisfaction.\r\nEveryone, from Archduke to crossing-sweeper, feared the day of his\r\ncoming to power. The story went out to the world that the Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand had been killed by Serbs. This was not true. The\r\nyoung men concerned in the conspiracy were Bosnians, and Austrian\r\nsubjects. The Government, however, saw that there was a chance of\r\nforcing a war upon Servia. If Austria could only prove that Servia had\r\nbeen responsible for the crime, she could undertake her long-planned\r\n“vengeance promenade” to Belgrade with the assurance that Europe would\r\nnot interfere. Statesmen anticipated no difficulty in fastening the\r\nguilt on Servia, as the murders of King Alexander and Queen Draga were\r\nnot forgotten. Austria, however, forgot her own black record. Emperor\r\nMaximilian of Mexico had been shot. It was always felt that more might\r\nhave been done by his own family for his safety. Empress Elizabeth had\r\nbeen assassinated at Geneva. Her decease was most convenient. The\r\ncountry was wearied of hearing of the pilgrimage of the heartbroken\r\nwoman through Europe. Crown Prince Rudolf, who was much too popular,\r\nhad also been murdered mysteriously. The persons concerned in his\r\ndeath had all been exiled. They had been sent to South America, but\r\npensions sufficient to keep them in luxury for the rest of their lives\r\nhad been bestowed upon them. These riches were only held on condition\r\nthat the fearful night at the lonely hunting-box near Vienna was never\r\nmentioned. Emperor Francis Joseph had thus lost his three nearest\r\nrelatives by assassination.\r\n\r\nThe news of the Archduke’s assassination was only discussed in whispers\r\nin Vienna. Everyone was afraid of arrest. Nevertheless, no one thought\r\nof accusing Servia. Archduke Francis Ferdinand was the one man in\r\nall the country who favoured the Slavs. His wife’s influence would\r\nsecure advancement at Court for every man with Slavonic blood in his\r\nveins. The Germans feared that they would be overrun with them. While\r\nAustrians and Hungarians generally detested the Archduke, the Slavs\r\nloved him devotedly. It was clear that neither the Austrian Slavs nor\r\nServia had any interest in the Archduke’s death. They had everything to\r\nlose.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial family was most anxious for his death. Archduke Frederick\r\nhad never forgotten the slight put upon his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe assassin had definite instructions to murder the Duchess Hohenberg.\r\nSuch orders could only come from persons actuated by motives of\r\npersonal hatred. No one else in the world desired her death. Women,\r\nespecially aristocrats and the mothers of families, are held in\r\ngreat veneration in Slav countries. It is certain that had the\r\nBosnians arranged the plot, the Archduke would have been shot, but\r\nthe morganatic wife spared. She was not even a member of the Imperial\r\nfamily. Why should she be sacrificed?\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Archduke and his wife were brought to Vienna.\r\nThe Austrians, a Catholic people, and accustomed to exaggerated\r\nrespect being paid to the dead, were deeply shocked at the funeral\r\narrangements. The Imperial family wished that every possible insult\r\nshould be shown to the remains of the defunct lady-in-waiting.\r\n\r\nItalians living in Trieste describe with horror the landing of the\r\ncoffins, which were brought from Bosnia by sea. They had no cause to\r\nlove the Archduke, but were outraged by the disrespect to the dead. The\r\nsailors who carried them from the ship let one coffin drop upon the\r\nquay through carelessness. It lay there until they had taken breath\r\nand felt inclined to resume their burden. The funeral arrangements\r\nin Vienna were of a very third-class order. The Austrians said: “The\r\nImperial family has no respect--not even for death. Their hate pursues\r\nits victims beyond the tomb.” The city was filled with reports of\r\nunseemly disputes about the funeral arrangements. The Imperial family\r\nwished to separate the pair of lovers, who had been so loyal to each\r\nother in life, and bury them separately. It was an outrage, they said,\r\nthat any Habsburg should walk behind the coffin of a morganatic wife.\r\nFinally, it was arranged that the coffins should lie in state side by\r\nside in the Hofburg Chapel. The Chapelle Ardente was poorly fitted;\r\ntrappings for a third-class funeral were used. The military party\r\nin Austria-Hungary was indignant that such an insult should be put\r\non a soldier. Old men, dressed in their uniforms ablaze with Orders\r\nand military decorations, entered the sombre chapel, which was not\r\neven properly supplied with candles. Bursting with indignation and\r\nrage, they knelt and said a short prayer for the dead. The deep-toned\r\nmutterings sounded more like cries for vengeance than prayers for\r\nthe souls of the departed. Bohemian nobles came into the chapel. They\r\nglared at the unseemly sight. Everything was poverty-stricken.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning a huge crowd had gathered to take part in the\r\nprocession in front of the coffins. Every Austro-Hungarian subject\r\nhas the right to see the face of the deceased monarch or of the heir\r\nto the throne after death. The Archduke’s coffin was sealed down.\r\nHis face could not be exposed; his head had been so disfigured. But,\r\nnevertheless, the Ringstrasse was filled with people. They were\r\npermitted to enter the chapel in single file. The police on the great\r\nRingstrasse sent many home, assuring them that their turn to enter\r\nthe Hofburg would never be reached. This show of popular sympathy had\r\nenraged the Court. When the funeral procession was on its way to the\r\nstation in Vienna after the lying-in-state, an unrehearsed incident\r\ntook place. A large number of Bohemian aristocrats, with Prince Max\r\nEgon Fürstenburg at their head, assembled in one of the squares. They\r\nwere either in costume or uniform, and were wearing the arms that\r\nbelonged to their rank--short daggers, for the most part. They walked\r\nbareheaded behind the funeral as chief mourners to show their respect\r\nto Duchess Hohenberg, a member of the Bohemian aristocracy, and their\r\nresentment at the insults that had been heaped upon her head. Who were\r\nthe proud Habsburgs to treat a Bohemian and a woman in such a way?\r\nTheir whole attitude was not one of mourning, but of protest.\r\n\r\nThe final scenes took place at Arstatten, beyond the Danube. They were\r\ndisgraceful beyond anything that had happened before. A violent storm\r\nforced the funeral _cortège_ to take refuge in an inn. The mutes became\r\noffensively drunk. Ghastly stories of the coffins being knocked off the\r\nchairs that were supporting them were circulated in Vienna. These may\r\nhave been exaggerated. There was, however, some truth in the tales of\r\nimpiety.\r\n\r\nThere was no one responsible in charge of the funeral. This was\r\nextraordinary, as the most unimportant Court ceremonies are always\r\nmanaged by experts long trained to do the right thing. Nothing is left\r\nto chance or accident. But the Archduke, the heir to the throne, was\r\nburied with less respect than would have been shown to an employé in\r\nthe Court service had he died that week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWHY GERMANY DECIDED UPON WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary had long been anxious to go to war. She had been\r\nstraining at the leash for years. The peaceful issue to the Annexation\r\ncrisis had not pleased Austrian statesmen. They were still less\r\nsatisfied at the check put upon their aggressive plans at the time of\r\nthe signing of the Treaty of Bucharest. In the first instance, the\r\ncredit of preserving peace was entirely due to Germany. She was not\r\nready. On the second occasion, Italy’s refusal to fight against the\r\nSerbs or to stand by Austria in an aggressive war was probably the\r\ndecisive factor, for then Germany was ready, and only waiting for a\r\ngood pretext to break the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen Kaiser Wilhelm heard of the assassination at Sarajevo he\r\nimmediately saw that the chance so long sought had come. Such an\r\nopportunity would never occur again. But he knew that he must play\r\nhis cards with skill. The Emperor of Austria would be delighted at a\r\nchance of punishing Servia, for her statesmen, who felt secure under\r\nthe protection of Russia, had used expressions in parleying with\r\nAustria that irritated the aged Emperor. He could not brook that small\r\nBalkan States of very recent growth should place themselves on a level\r\nwith the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His councillors succeeded in making\r\nhim believe that the Serbs were responsible for the crime of Sarajevo.\r\nThe aged Emperor, perhaps, had some suspicion of the truth. He did not\r\nwant to know it, however. Providence had intervened and removed an\r\nobnoxious personage, and had at the same time given Austria a chance of\r\nthrashing Servia. The Emperor considered that the thrashing was long\r\noverdue. Why should he, the faithful son of the Church, inquire too\r\nclosely into events that had fallen out so propitiously? The Emperor,\r\nhowever, only wished to send a punitive expedition to Belgrade.\r\nGunboats could bombard the capital from the Danube, and Austria’s\r\nhonour would be satisfied. The Emperor in no wise wished for a war with\r\nRussia. Apart from other considerations, he was bound in honour not to\r\nseek a quarrel with the “peace” Czar. When the Annexation crisis was\r\nat its height, Emperor Francis Joseph sent Prince Hohenlohe to St.\r\nPetersburg with an autograph letter, begging the Czar to allow him to\r\nend his days in peace. The terms in which this document was couched\r\nmade it almost impossible for Austria to seek war with Russia so long\r\nas Emperor Francis Joseph was at the head of affairs. It was a breach\r\nof the honour that reigns among monarchs, for the appeal had been made\r\nas from a brother-sovereign. Kaiser Wilhelm was aware of this. But he\r\nwas ready to stoop to any crime to accomplish his object. He and his\r\ncouncillors decided that the aged man at Schönbrunn could be deceived.\r\nHe must think that the war would be merely a local affair. The\r\nAustrians, too, were longing to show their prowess against Servia, but\r\na war with Russia would not be popular either in Austria or Hungary. It\r\nis doubtful whether any Austro-Hungarian statesman who understood the\r\nsituation would have consented to acts that must inevitably lead to a\r\nEuropean war. The idea of a series of small wars, first against Italy\r\nand then against the mutinous Balkan States, was favoured in Vienna.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm had a singular talent for discovering unscrupulous men.\r\nThe German Ambassador in Vienna, Count Tchirsky, was a complete tool\r\nin the hands of the Kaiser. He did not hesitate to lie to Count Tisza\r\nwhen occasion occurred. Count Tisza is a man of peculiar loyalty, and\r\nhe could not understand utter unscrupulousness in another. Moreover,\r\nlike all aristocrats, he was at a disadvantage in dealing with Germans,\r\nas he was a gentleman and his opponents were not. He was always at\r\nBudapesth, and therefore had no chance of watching the machinations\r\nemployed by the Germans in Vienna. With Count Berchtold the German\r\nAmbassador had an easy task. The Count did not take things seriously,\r\nand fell into the toils spread for him by German statesmen. He really\r\nbelieved that the Emperor was an old man in his dotage, and neglected\r\nthe other side of his character. In spite of his age and weakness, the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph had enjoyed a unique experience as the oldest\r\nreigning monarch in Europe, and was able through this to judge of any\r\nquestion with an acumen exhibited by few politicians.\r\n\r\nGermany decided that the moment for letting a European war break loose\r\nhad come, and her reasons for this decision were weighty. The most\r\nimportant of all was the “Slav danger,” as it was generally called\r\nin Germany and Austria-Hungary. Twenty years ago the German family\r\naveraged sixteen to eighteen children. In Austria, too, large families\r\nhad been the rule. The Magyars in Hungary still boasted big families,\r\nbut the cancer that had bitten into German social life was beginning\r\nto be seen there, too. The one-child family had become the fashion in\r\nGermany. The mode was adopted by the Germans in Austria. Statesmen\r\nscolded, and proposed to tax bachelors and childless couples. But\r\nthey were unable to stop the terrifying decrease in the population.\r\nMeanwhile, the Slavonic races in both Germany and Austria and Hungary\r\nmultiplied very rapidly. Military men complained that regiments,\r\nofficers and men, were composed entirely of Slavs, because there were\r\nnot sufficient Austro-Germans or Magyars. It was impossible to enter\r\na room where men of purely German extraction had assembled without\r\nhearing of this “Slav danger,” which hung like a nightmare over the\r\nruling races in Germany. Austria and Hungary saw their preponderance\r\nthreatened. They doctored statistics to hide the truth. This was\r\nof little use. The Slav type was unmistakable. Slavs did not care\r\nto intermarry with Germans, and the race remained purely Slavonic,\r\nalthough Serbs and Czechs often intermarried. A war would afford an\r\nopportunity of reducing the Slav population. The military authorities\r\nhad arranged to place the regiments composed of subject-races in the\r\nfront of the battle so that they might be killed off. In 1914 leading\r\nmen in both Germany and Austria-Hungary considered that war was\r\ninevitable within the next five years if they were to retain their\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nThe financial factor, too, was largely responsible for hastening\r\nthe date of the war. Large sums had been spent on armaments in both\r\nGermany and Austria-Hungary far beyond the capacity of either country.\r\nTaxation had risen imperceptibly, and with it the cost of living. This\r\nhad affected the middle classes. It is doubtful whether the families\r\nof officials in State employ and army officers ever got a really\r\nsatisfactory meal in the last years of preparation. Men dressed in\r\ngorgeous uniforms, and with Orders and decorations that showed their\r\nrank, walked about the streets gaunt and hungry-looking.\r\n\r\nPeople said, “This cannot go on.” Statesmen saw that it would be\r\nrevolution or war. Austria was faced with bankruptcy unless she could\r\nfight a successful war which would open fresh regions for exploitation\r\nand relieve her of her surplus Slavs.\r\n\r\nUndue importance was attached to news of unrest in Great Britain,\r\nboth in Germany and Austria-Hungary. Spies, men who were only too\r\nready to believe that Britain was at her last gasp, brought back\r\nreports that a revolution was about to break out. The Irish question\r\nwas misunderstood. The greed and hate that had been nurtured in every\r\nGerman heart prevented the spy from exercising any judgment, while\r\nthe statesmen who should have controlled their reports had also lost\r\ntheir usual faculty of calm judgment in the bitterness of their hate.\r\nThe woman question, which was seen in its ugliest aspects abroad, made\r\nthe Germans realise that there was something wrong. Why were they\r\nso discontented? What had been done to render them so bitter? The\r\nquestion was asked in the Press and in public, and no explanation was\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nJews who travelled throughout Europe on business brought back evil\r\nreports of conditions in England. They said that they had searched the\r\nlength and breadth of the land for a capable business man to push their\r\ninterests. They had returned from their quest unsatisfied. Germans and\r\nAustrians who had resided in England explained this by saying that all\r\nthe better elements in the country had emigrated long ago. Men could\r\nfind no work unless they had influence. These facts were confirmed by\r\nobservation, and undue importance was attached to them, single examples\r\nbeing too hastily accepted as indicative of the general state of things.\r\n\r\nThe preference shown by English business men for German clerks was\r\nregarded as another proof that the English were “a back number.”\r\n\r\nIf Britain were degenerating, Russia was on the up-grade. She was\r\narming. She was reforming her public offices. Large loans had been\r\ncontracted, and she was about to build railways to the frontier. The\r\nAustro-Russian front in Galicia bristled with fortresses. Every week\r\nbrought news of some new fortifications, made either on the Austrian\r\nor the Russian side. The Slav peoples in the Balkans were also on the\r\nup-grade. Everywhere the Germans saw themselves surrounded by Slavs,\r\nwho were educating and improving themselves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, not only the German people, but the German army, was\r\ndeteriorating. Nasty stories, like _The Small Garrison_, were being\r\nwritten, describing life in small garrison towns. The Austrian and\r\nHungarian officers were also suffering from the corrupt life which they\r\nled. It was very uncertain whether they would have the necessary nerve\r\nto take the initiative at a crisis. Kaiser Wilhelm saw that the time\r\nwas not far distant when his officers would be as bad as the Austrians.\r\nIt was bad policy to wait until the growing evil that had corrupted the\r\nAustro-Hungarian army had infected his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC METHODS: A COMPARISON\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplomacy had succeeded in keeping the peace on two former occasions.\r\nIn Western Europe it was believed that it would be successful again.\r\nAustria’s intention of going to war was not regarded as serious. The\r\nEuropean financier especially could not bring himself to believe in\r\nwar. Some of the ablest men in Europe sat in the open-air café on\r\nthe Ringstrasse, unable to close an eye in sleep for fear that they\r\nshould miss news of supreme importance and not be there to “cover” at\r\nthe critical moment. At two in the morning the great houses on either\r\nside of the street shook as the motors carrying the big guns rumbled\r\npast the café. They were taken off at dead of night and deposited on\r\nthe low-lying ground near the Danube. Next morning the great gun was\r\ntaken to pieces. One half of the immense engine of destruction was\r\nslung on big hooks on a frame made for the purpose. It looked like a\r\ngreat hollow cradle that would have provided sleeping accommodation\r\nfor a couple of men as it swirled and rocked when the train took a\r\nsteep gradient. “Why have they brought out their big guns, which are\r\nso difficult to transport on the steep gradients in this mountainous\r\ncountry, if they do not mean business?” “Merely to frighten Servia\r\nand cow her into submission.” “Then why is everything being done so\r\nsecretly?” “Merely to heighten the effect,” was the reply. Foreign\r\ndiplomacy was not so blind, but it sat tight, and refused to give any\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe State controls the railways in Austro-Hungary, excepting for\r\none or two lines. The great termini in Vienna lie at different ends\r\nof the city. Ordinary passengers had to cross the town in cabs. The\r\nOrient express, however, was allowed to make use of the military\r\ncommunication railway to save time. This circular railway joined up\r\nall the big junctions. It had been constructed for purely military\r\npurposes to pass troops and munitions from one station to the other\r\nquickly and secretly. In solitary places, sidings, with an iron pontoon\r\nfor heavy guns, and perhaps an immense crane, stood moss-grown and\r\nidle. They were ready against the great day when Austria would go to\r\nwar. The chief preparations were made in the Prater, an Imperial park\r\nthat had been thrown open to the public many years before. In the\r\nwaste swamp-land behind the park, which stretched down to the main\r\nstream of the Danube, there were cranes used for unloading barges\r\nthat came up the river from the Balkans, and that also served for the\r\nmobilisation. Just beyond this ground there was a café much frequented\r\nby the diplomatists of Vienna. Close by was the British Golf Club.\r\nThe café had, no doubt, come into fashion because the chiefs of the\r\nDiplomatic Service in Austria congregated there to meet military men,\r\nwho took their morning ride, where they could supervise the training of\r\nrecruits, in the waste land beyond. But the position of the golf ground\r\nneeded explanation. Who had chosen to plump the course right in the\r\nmidst of the probable scene of any military preparation?\r\n\r\nNo answer will ever be made to this question. The British diplomatist,\r\nwhen he has a streak of Celtic blood in his make-up, is undoubtedly\r\nthe finest in the world. He has the great gift of silence. Other men\r\nof great repute and long training always envy the Englishman his\r\nimperturbable face, which serves him as a complete mask. Nothing\r\nprovokes him into a display of emotion; his habitual calm prevents the\r\nenemy ever surprising him into a betrayal of his country’s secrets\r\nby a smile or a grimace. This is a unique gift. The secret police\r\nin every city of Europe will tell you that there is no catching an\r\nEnglishman off his guard. His news is always sound. He does not care\r\nfor information from doubtful sources; he misdoubts the foreigner and\r\nall his ways. He takes endless trouble in following up clues, but will\r\nnot venture to draw conclusions. He is careful never to compromise\r\nhimself by employing unworthy tools, and is never in “trouble” with the\r\nauthorities or under suspicion like other diplomatists.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are always too few of him. He is hampered by\r\nhaving no residents in the British colony that he can consult. The\r\nfirst years of a diplomatist’s life in a foreign country are occupied\r\nin learning the lie of the land. Until he is acquainted with the\r\nrudiments of the language and the significance of the utterances of the\r\ndifferent papers, he can do no useful work.\r\n\r\nThe German diplomatist, a man without a vestige of imagination,\r\nignorant of the very first rules of diplomacy, unaware of the\r\nmeaning of delicacy in his conduct as the guest of a foreign monarch,\r\nnevertheless frequently contrives to defeat his opponents. Why is this?\r\nHow is it done? The German would be incapable of producing the results\r\nthat he has been able to show were it not for the powerful “hand behind\r\nthe throne.” Diplomatists at a Court like Vienna must be noblemen, and\r\nit is a matter of general knowledge that German aristocrats are not\r\nastute as a general rule. They have no conception of anything beyond\r\nthe obvious. Hints and allusions are quite thrown away upon them. Now\r\na diplomatist must be a man of very delicate perceptions. It may be\r\nsafely said that such a thing does not exist in Germany. The Prussian\r\nespecially is very obtuse. The Germans possess one great virtue.\r\nThey are aware of their deficiencies. The diplomatist, who feels he\r\nis lacking in all the essential qualities of a politician, takes a\r\npartner--a very active partner, who is never seen or heard, but, none\r\nthe less, is responsible for much of the work. He is a Jew, who manages\r\nthe whole organisation of the work. He finances the diplomatist. German\r\ndiplomatists are not paid much in proportion to the show that they\r\nare expected to make. Everything is “solid,” but nothing more. The\r\nGovernment, however, authorises an almost unlimited expenses account.\r\nThis money is not squandered. Much is spent in the form of tips to\r\npersons who may be of use. No other diplomatist could venture to pay\r\nsmall sums of money to all sorts of doubtful persons in the first\r\nyears of his residence at a foreign Court. Such persons might be, and\r\nprobably are, spies of the Government, or members of the secret police.\r\nThe German diplomatist is not troubled with these doubts. On entering\r\nhis embassy he finds a record of all the work, clean and unclean, done\r\nby his predecessors, and the financial man, who has been in the post\r\nfor years, in charge. Every successful means of getting information is\r\nsuggested to him. He thus gets the benefit of the experience of his\r\npredecessors, avoids their mistakes, and improves on their methods,\r\nas every new man can. No German nobleman could carry on this business\r\nunaided. The Jew is a man of business, _par excellence_. His principle\r\nis, “Never take anything without paying for it.” He not only pays for\r\nany little service rendered, delicately considering the feelings of the\r\nrecipient, and where gold would give offence he sees that an order, or,\r\nperhaps, a much-coveted title is bestowed, but he always makes sure\r\nthat the recipient is satisfied. A Jew, concerned in statecraft, will\r\nnever allow a tool, however humble, to go away discontented, for if he\r\ndid he would have made him a dangerous enemy, instead of a grateful\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nA young diplomatist starting for the Balkans will carry a set of\r\ninstructions which regulate his every act in everyday life. “Put up\r\nat the ---- Hotel.” “Give the waiter at the ---- restaurant a big\r\ntip ... not sufficient to excite suspicion, but enough to render\r\nhim communicative.” “Find means of getting to know the big German\r\nmanufacturer at ----without being seen with him too much.” “Cultivate\r\nthe men connected with travel bureaux as much as possible without\r\ncompromising your position.” Imagine a young Englishman told off to\r\ncultivate men behind a counter! But the proud German will make any\r\nsacrifice, willingly, and, indeed, counts it no loss, for he is never\r\na snob. Snobbism is unknown in either Germany or Austria-Hungary.\r\nDiplomatists are always born within the magic circle. They are always\r\nmen belonging to families admitted to Court functions. This means an\r\nancient family. Persons outside this circle are not regarded as equals.\r\nFar from it. They are so far removed from the nobility that they\r\nare looked upon as people of different flesh and blood. The German\r\naristocrat thinks of the commoner somewhat as the Spaniard of the\r\nSouthern States regards a nigger. But just because he condescends, he\r\nis very polite. The poor commoner must not guess his feelings. He can\r\ntreat him as a friend and a brother without any risk of suffering loss\r\nof caste in the eyes of his peers. Where comparison is impossible there\r\nis no fear of his losing rank by associating with men of a different\r\nmould.\r\n\r\nThe young Englishman might speak in the street to a prominent\r\nfellow-countryman engaged in trade. Never, however, would he condescend\r\nto sit down at one table with his vulgar wife, and thus make a\r\nwilling slave of him for ever. The Jew, watching the steps of the new\r\ndiplomatists, is very careful to ascertain that any favour conferred\r\nwill be accepted with gratitude, otherwise it is never offered.\r\n\r\nThe German diplomatist always speaks a number of languages, sometimes\r\nwith a slight accent, sometimes like a native. He learnt them in the\r\nnursery. The British diplomatist usually speaks the language of the\r\ncountry to which he is accredited more or less fluently, but he seldom\r\nknows a second language. French is the language of the Balkans. But\r\nthe variety spoken is very unlike pure Parisian. It is only possible to\r\nconverse with Albanian princes, Turkish pashas, Rumanians, and other\r\npeople from the south if one’s knowledge of French is very exact.\r\nFluency in French makes intercourse with Italians and Russians easy, as\r\nthey all speak it. A man who has business in the South or in the Tyrol\r\nshould also speak Italian. The people there know German as well as\r\nItalian, but dislike speaking it. They feel mistrust towards anyone who\r\nuses the tongue of the oppressor. Besides they do not care to discuss\r\npolitics or give information of any kind in a language that every spy\r\nor would-be spy within hearing can understand. No commercial traveller\r\nwould start off without a thorough knowledge of the languages prevalent\r\nin the country in which he was to do business, but there is a great\r\nlaxity of views in regard to the standard of linguistic talent required\r\nin the diplomatist.\r\n\r\nThe members of Embassies and Legations of the British Empire are, for\r\nthe most part, purely British. Any strain of foreign blood impairs\r\ntheir usefulness to such an extent that this is well. The foreign\r\npoliticians who deal with members of the Diplomatic Corps naturally\r\nmistrust any half-breeds, as they call them. They prefer to have to\r\ndeal with a prospective enemy who declares his feelings openly, rather\r\nthan to be obliged to negotiate with the son of a German mother,\r\nwho may be secretly inclined to favour his mother’s race and make\r\nconcessions that will not be ratified by the home Government.\r\n\r\nIf the British Diplomatic Service is unique in its special line\r\nbecause it is homogeneous, the men being all of the same type as\r\ntheir _confrères_ in the Home Office or War Office at home, the same\r\ncannot be said for the Consular Service, which, especially in remote\r\nparts of Europe, is of but small or no benefit to Britain, while it\r\nhas been of immense advantage to her rivals in trade. In cases where\r\nthere is a genuine Briton at the head of affairs, he naturally takes\r\na British view of all disputes that come along and form his daily\r\nwork. But he is a startling exception. Most of the men in the Consular\r\nService were Germans or natives; they gave their services for nothing,\r\nsaying that the title lent them importance. It did. It enabled them to\r\ninterfere in the thousand and one difficulties that are always arising\r\nbetween shippers and the Government--their own Government--and to\r\nplace the British case in a bad light. The shipper, not knowing the\r\nlanguage, was quite helpless, and went back home the poorer in cash\r\nand disheartened. His owners were annoyed, and decided that they would\r\ncease to carry on dealings with the country in question. A German firm\r\nwas quite ready to rush in to benefit by the facts which the consul had\r\ncarefully ascertained during the negotiations, and snap up the trade.\r\nThe German consul usually gave away large sums of money among the\r\nindigent in the British colony, and thus placed himself in a position\r\nthat was very difficult to assail. If any powerful resident felt that\r\nthe consul was not acting altogether in British interests, the latest\r\nsubscription, probably a princely donation to some British charity,\r\ncaused him to revise his hasty judgment. A man so truly charitable\r\ncould not be guilty of meannesses such as he had suspected. He did not\r\nrealise that the consul put the thumping big subscription down in his\r\nexpenses account, entered as “Money to blind British residents.” The\r\nBritish merchant prince, perhaps, did not care to assist some poor\r\ncountryman; he left it to the consul, who took the money ostensibly\r\nfrom his own pocket, and the Englishman, ashamed at his niggardliness,\r\nfelt that his mouth was effectually shut, even when he was more\r\nthan doubtful about some action taken with regard to his country’s\r\ninterests. These things happened in many places, and led British\r\nsubjects living abroad to regard justice and law as non-existent so\r\nfar as they were concerned. They were forced to have resort to all\r\nkinds of subterfuges to obtain the most elementary rights. They avoided\r\nlitigation at any cost, for they knew that with a German consul it\r\ncould only go against them. Old residents who knew the language and\r\ncustoms of the country were able to carry on business even in the\r\nGerman strongholds, for, after all, the Englishman is the best business\r\nman in the world. But they had to work at a disadvantage. Germans stood\r\nready to take up the trade should the creator of the connection be\r\nill or die. And the resident consul was always ready to replace the\r\nEnglishman by his own man.\r\n\r\nIn places where there was a British consul all this was different.\r\nThe authorities, feeling that a strong hand would protect British\r\nsubjects, hesitated to attack any one of them without due cause.\r\nIn these cities the British subject enjoyed the same immunity from\r\nunwarranted interference as the Italian. The Italian consul, at the\r\ncost of much inconvenience and annoyance to himself, would stand by a\r\nfellow-citizen until he obtained his rights. The authorities, knowing\r\nthis, were frightened to interfere with any man who was carrying on a\r\nlegitimate business. The Italian consul knew that he had his Government\r\nbehind him in protecting Italian trade, and that his mission was to\r\ncarry on warfare with the German; nor did he scruple to use the same\r\nweapons as his adversary. He was even capable of going one better.\r\nPerhaps of all the peoples of Europe the Italian alone understands the\r\npeculiar character of the German--an experience that has been bought at\r\nthe price of much suffering. He knows that it is fatal to wait until\r\nthe German takes the offensive. The blow must come from the other side.\r\nThen the German’s indolence will make him careful of provoking an\r\nadversary of this calibre a second time. The Prussian is essentially\r\na bully; he can only be brought to reason by a frontal attack, and\r\nthose who know him will not hesitate to make it with or without excuse,\r\nprovided they get in the first blow, for the struggle must come sooner\r\nor later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nPUNITIVE EXPEDITION OR WORLD-WAR?\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany and Austria-Hungary hastened on their preparations. Transports\r\nof munitions were hurried to the front. The building of the new War\r\nMinistry in Vienna, which had long been proceeding, was hurried on. The\r\nGovernment did not care to go to war with all the mobilisation plans\r\nlying in the old building. It was situated in a crowded part of the\r\ncity close to the flower market. It would have been very easy to blow\r\nup the entire structure. Many of the Slavs within the Empire would not\r\nhave hesitated to use their opportunity of throwing everything into\r\nconfusion. The new War Office on the Ringstrasse, built in the newest\r\nand worst style of architecture, was easily guarded.\r\n\r\nThe German preparations were on a much vaster scale than those\r\nmade in Austria-Hungary. Germany was preparing for a world-war,\r\nAustria-Hungary for a punitive expedition against Servia. Austria has\r\nalways been solicitous of the good opinion of other countries. She now\r\nsent out batches of official despatches intended to incriminate Servia\r\nin the eyes of Europe. Germany, who cared little upon what pretext she\r\nbegan the Great War, and knew that she must earn hatred for herself\r\nthroughout the civilised world, did nothing to prepare the world.\r\nShe knew that it was a general war. Why waste time and efforts in\r\njustifying Germany’s right to be “über alles”? Conquerors of the world\r\ndo not stop to explain their methods.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by Austria-Hungary began to weaken in her resolve.\r\nGerman diplomatists noticed the hesitation. They suggested that a\r\nstiff Note should be sent to Servia. When the text of the famous Note\r\nappeared, it was noticed that the phraseology was not Austrian. It was\r\nnot couched in the soft language--a sort of modified German--spoken on\r\nthe banks of the Danube, but in the rude terms heard farther north.\r\nEveryone said that the text of the Note had been written in Berlin. It\r\nis just possible that Count Tisza had been a party to it. He kept up\r\nconstant intercourse with Berlin, and may have visited the Emperor\r\nor been consulted over the telephone. The intention of the Note was\r\nclear. No State with any claim to sovereign rights could accept it.\r\nAustria-Hungary demanded the right to send her own police to Servia\r\nto investigate the crime of Sarajevo, although it had been committed\r\non Austrian ground by Austrian subjects. No Serb was implicated.\r\nThe Austrian Government was unable to bring any proofs of Servian\r\ncomplicity beyond vague assertions that the assassin had received\r\ninstruction in military exercises in the ranks of a volunteer corps in\r\nBelgrade. Austria relied upon the strength of unproven assertions to\r\nestablish an absolutely untenable case. The Note was not only couched\r\nin the most insulting terms; it demanded an answer within forty-eight\r\nhours. During those forty-eight hours strong diplomatic pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon Servia. She finally consented to eat humble pie.\r\nShe was willing to do this in spite of her recent conquests. She had\r\nvanquished Bulgaria and had added considerably to the extent of her\r\nterritory. Russia fully appreciated her position. It was difficult for\r\nany Government to accept the terms of such a Note, for the people could\r\nnot be expected to understand the political necessity. Nevertheless,\r\nat four o’clock on the fatal Saturday, news was received from Belgrade\r\nthat Servia had resolved to submit. Her diplomatists said that she had\r\nno choice. Her army was exhausted. Her stock of munitions was low. She\r\nneeded all her available funds to carry on the work of reconstruction\r\nof the devastated country. The Albanians, in the newly acquired\r\nregions, were giving continual trouble. They descended from their\r\nmountains and stole cattle from the Serbs. Expeditions had been sent\r\nagainst them, but, as the Serbs said, the Albanians had been accustomed\r\nfrom time immemorial to make an annual descent into the plains for\r\nthe purpose of re-victualling, and the fact that the land where their\r\ndepredations were made belonged to Servia instead of being a part of\r\nthe decrepit Turkish Empire made no difference. Many of the Albanians\r\nhardly knew of the change of government. They needed cattle and corn,\r\nand naturally made raids to get it. Servia, however, was forced to keep\r\nan army on the frontier because of them.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and the pressure brought to bear by the Russian\r\nAmbassador, rendered Servia willing to consent to any terms.\r\n\r\nRussia stood by her small ally, and sent out an official warning that\r\nshe could “not remain indifferent to Servia’s fate.” This softened\r\nthe natural chagrin felt by the small State in yielding to Austria.\r\nServia’s answer was a soft reply to a rough question. She accepted most\r\nof the cruel conditions imposed upon her, but desired to refer one\r\npoint to a Hague Convention. Everyone in Austria considered the answer\r\nsufficient. The news circulated in Vienna that the crisis was over. An\r\nemissary from the Vatican, who had been working hard for peace, spread\r\nthe joyful news through the city. His face shone with satisfaction as\r\nhe passed from group to group in the waiting crowd. “It was a near\r\nthing,” he said, “but the Serbs are well advised to give in.”\r\n\r\nBig financiers breathed again, and some of the newspapers began\r\nprinting extra editions. The editions were mere sheets of paper,\r\ndistributed gratis, as newspapers may not be hawked in the streets in\r\nAustria. They quoted an article in the Servian official paper, saying\r\nthat Servia was willing to give in to the demands.\r\n\r\nTime went on; such information as could be obtained from persons\r\nconnected with foreign diplomatic circles confirmed the news of peace.\r\n\r\nAs evening set in the news was received that the official answer from\r\nServia had come. It was quite satisfactory. The Austrian Government had\r\nnever thought of Servia’s making such complete surrender. Many people\r\nstarted off for week-ends in the country, sure that the _communiqué_\r\nthat would be issued by the Vienna Foreign Office that night would be\r\nmerely an elaboration of the news already spread throughout the city.\r\n\r\nThe Vienna Bourse, which had been falling slowly and steadily ever\r\nsince the assassination of the Archduke, had reached its lowest point\r\nthat morning. Servia’s answer had reached Vienna in time to effect\r\na lightning improvement, and prices were better than they had been\r\nsince the beginning of the crisis. Thus there resulted the remarkable\r\nphenomenon that prices were steady and firm on the very day that a\r\nworld-war was decided. The Bourse was closed for many months after the\r\nfatal Saturday, the official closing prices remaining a remarkable\r\ntestimony to the narrowness of the margin between war and peace.\r\nWhile the great financiers played on a peace basis, others waited.\r\nWhy was the _communiqué_ not issued? Was there a hitch? It was known\r\nthat Count Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister, had telephoned\r\nto Berlin. He wished to consult with the Kaiser before accepting the\r\nreply as sufficient. The German Government said it was too late to\r\nretreat; Servia’s answer must not be accepted, and counselled Berchtold\r\nto recall the Austro-Hungarian Minister at Belgrade. Count Berchtold\r\nfollowed Germany’s advice; the news became known in Vienna very\r\nquickly. Extra editions were distributed, saying that the Minister had\r\nleft Belgrade and that diplomatic relations with Servia were broken\r\noff. Austrian officials let it be known that no declaration of war\r\nwould be made, and that a Great Power would not parley with Servia.\r\nGunboats had already started down the Danube to bombard Belgrade.\r\nAustria considered that a small force would be sufficient to subjugate\r\nServia, and in the city people spoke of the promenade into Belgrade.\r\nThis news was circulated to make any subsequent retreat or withdrawal\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nNo one thought of a great war that night, for the news that Russia\r\nintended to stand by Servia had been carefully kept back.\r\n\r\nCount Berchtold, having committed the Government to war, had a\r\ndifficult task before him. It was very doubtful whether Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph could be prevailed upon to sign the order for a general\r\nmobilisation. Large bodies of troops had already left for both the\r\nServian and Russian fronts, but no general mobilisation could take\r\nplace without an order signed by the Emperor. The aged monarch was\r\nanxious that Servia should be chastised. But he did not wish to risk a\r\nworld-war. He was afraid of Russia, with her immense resources both in\r\nmen and material. It was now that the long years of work accomplished\r\nby German diplomacy in Vienna bore fruit.\r\n\r\nTchirsky, the German Ambassador, visited Count Berchtold. He showed him\r\nthat Austria must go to war or lose her position as a Great Power in\r\nEurope. There would be a world-war, but it must come. Germany intended\r\nto go to Paris and St. Petersburg. This was an opportunity such as\r\nmight never come again. It was only the question of dealing with the\r\nold Emperor. If he knew the truth, he would never sign the mobilisation\r\norder. Why should he be consulted? He did not know of the Russian Note.\r\nWhy not keep it back until the irrevocable decision had been taken?\r\n\r\nBerchtold listened to the voice of the tempter and fell. He informed\r\nthe Emperor that Europe would look on with folded hands while Servia\r\nwas chastised for the assassination of the Archduke. This seemed very\r\nnatural to the old autocrat. He was in residence at Ischl, as usual in\r\nsummer-time, and had no opportunity of conversing with anyone who could\r\nhave told him the truth about Russia.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Berchtold was fully aware of the magnitude of\r\nthe decision he had taken upon himself. He was fully aware that he\r\nwas deceiving the Emperor, and excused his conduct by his conviction\r\nthat the ruler was no longer capable of judging what was best for the\r\ncountry. He had been attacked by the Vienna Press for years. He was\r\naccused of feebleness and weakness by Count Tchirsky’s organs; now he\r\nwould show strength and resolution. As often happens with weak men, he\r\nshowed it at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of war was announced in Vienna, the crowd immediately\r\nstarted for the Servian Legation. The Serbs, with great astuteness,\r\nhad always chosen a legation that could not be looted or even damaged\r\nwithout the rest of the house being pulled down. They always took the\r\nquiet apartments at the back of one of the immense barrack-like houses\r\nthat line the great streets in Vienna. Demonstrations had been made\r\nfrequently in front of the Legation during the last few weeks, and the\r\ncrowd reached the street to find it blocked by troops. It then turned\r\ntowards the Embassy quarter. The Vienna police were well prepared.\r\nSeveral regiments of soldiers had been called out to assist them, and\r\nthe Embassies being for the most part close together, it was easy to\r\nguard them. None the less, it was a stirring night. The procession\r\ndivided into two streams. One went to the French Embassy, the other\r\nturned its steps towards the Russian and British Embassies. Neither\r\nGermany nor Austria-Hungary imagined for an instant that England would\r\ntake part in the fight. They were convinced that she would consider it\r\nto her interest to remain neutral. The crowd, however, with a correct\r\ninstinct, regarded England as an enemy. Three times the roughs broke\r\nthrough the cordon of guards and rushed upon the Embassy buildings,\r\nbut were turned back by the military. Those in command had received\r\nvery definite orders. The Embassies were to be protected at all costs.\r\nLater on the crowd wreaked its fury upon shops owned by Serbs. They\r\nwere gutted in a few minutes, and no one interfered. The police even\r\nstood by and admired the good work. Serbs and Russians were maltreated\r\nin the streets. Terrible incidents occurred. The police were to blame,\r\nfor it would have been easy to interfere. Just as they had allowed the\r\nMohammedans to plunder the Serbs and appropriate their belongings at\r\nSarajevo after the assassination, so they permitted the same thing to\r\nbe done in Vienna. A spirit was roused that will not be easy to quell.\r\nThe bloodthirstiness of the mob is easily excited, but calming it is\r\nanother matter, as the old despots in France learned to their cost. The\r\nlatent quality of cruelty, which is hidden beneath the more obvious\r\ncharacteristics of the Viennese, was seen at its worst. Good-tempered\r\ntoleration gave way to bestiality. That spirit of fair-play which\r\nhabitually animates an Austrian crowd was replaced by a desire for\r\nother people’s belongings. The truce between the members of the\r\nvarious races, kept for half a century, was over. German and Slav were\r\nat war. Racial hate flamed up. Passions that will take long to cool\r\nwere excited. The great and tremendous struggle between the two great\r\npredominating races in Eastern Europe, the Germans and the Slavs, had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nWHAT WOULD ENGLAND SAY?\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning the jubilant feeling that had pervaded Vienna the night\r\nbefore was totally gone. A reaction had set in. Everyone realised\r\nthat the war was not to be a punitive expedition. It was a world-war.\r\nThe telegram sent by Russia was published to the world, and Austria\r\nwaited with ill-concealed anxiety to know what England intended to do.\r\nGermany was convinced of England’s neutrality; she was certain that\r\nItaly meant to go in with the two mighty Powers that were to sweep\r\nthe European chessboard with their mighty armies. Austria-Hungary was\r\nnot so confident as Germany. She knew that Italy was a most uncertain\r\nfactor. With diplomatic cunning she had concealed what she knew of\r\nItaly’s intentions from her ally. She had feared that Germany might not\r\nback her if she knew that the two Central Empires would be forced to\r\nstand alone. The Kaiser had always said that he must have a fleet in\r\nthe Mediterranean at call before he began a world-war. If Italy stood\r\nby him, everything was easy. Italy now declared her neutrality. The\r\nAustrians expected this, and worse; they said quite freely, “Now that\r\nItaly has the chance, she will turn upon us.” Guilty consciences helped\r\nthem to realise the truth. They had oppressed Italy for so long that\r\nthey never even expected her to do anything but take advantage of the\r\nchance. Her statesmen were pessimists. They could never share Kaiser\r\nWilhelm’s optimism. They were aware that Austria had played the part\r\nof tyrant, and did not expect gratitude. Unaccustomed to keep treaties\r\nthemselves, they did not expect other people to consider them as\r\nbinding when a chance of doing better presented itself. Austria, with\r\nher cynicism, came much nearer the truth than Germany, who oppressed\r\nher Slav subjects and then expected them to join in the song of\r\n“Deutschland über Alles” and to love the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian politician, with a fineness of perception to which his\r\nGerman _confrère_ is a stranger, understood that England would go\r\nin with her allies. Germany argued, “It is Britain’s interest to\r\nremain neutral, to capture the whole carrying-trade of Europe.” The\r\nAustrian people hoped and believed that they might be right, but her\r\npoliticians had a conviction that Britain would not fall into Germany’s\r\ncarefully-spread toils. The Austrians also suspected that Britain knew\r\nmore of Germany’s aims than she acknowledged. They always complained\r\nthat Britain was an unknown factor. No statesman laid his cards on the\r\ntable as the Germans or as they themselves did.\r\n\r\nYet, having no cause to detest Britain, they naturally understood her\r\nbetter than the Germans, who were blinded by the bitterest hate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, European diplomacy was loth to believe that the last chance\r\nof peace was gone. Efforts were made to come to some agreement. These\r\nattempts to keep a peace that was already so seriously compromised were\r\nonly forlorn hopes. It is just possible that, in spite of everything,\r\nthey might have succeeded had it not been for various pieces of\r\ntrickery. Germany, whose reputation for honesty still stood high,\r\ndid not hesitate to stop important telegrams which were on their way\r\nto Austria. She had made such costly preparations for war that she\r\nconsidered that it would be inadvisable to withdraw now. Austria was\r\nallowed no chance of reconsidering her decision, although Germany knew\r\nthat it had been made upon false premises.\r\n\r\nThe Viennese, now thoroughly frightened at the future, wished ardently\r\nfor peace. The war for which they had clamoured turned out something\r\nvery different from what they had expected. They would have to meet\r\nenemies on all sides; only the frontier towards Germany was safe. The\r\ncity of Vienna was hastily fortified. It was no use taking chances.\r\nHuge mounds were thrown up on the immense March plain beyond the\r\nDanube, where many battles had been fought in the past. Meanwhile,\r\nthe public took enormous interest in the negotiations which were\r\nstill being carried on. Sir Edward Grey was the most popular man in\r\nthe capital for several days. He had always succeeded in keeping\r\npeace before. Would he be able to do so again? The reply soon came.\r\nUnder similar circumstances he had been successful twice before\r\nbecause Germany was not ready. Now she had finished the last of her\r\npreparations, and did not wish for compromise.\r\n\r\nWhen the news came that Britain was to stand by Russia and France,\r\nthere was a burst of rage throughout the country. So much had been\r\nhoped from her neutrality. “The English were shopkeepers. Why had\r\nthey not taken the opportunity that fate afforded them and become rich\r\nby supplying the belligerents with arms and provisions?” asked the\r\nAustrians, who now said that Germany had deceived them with promises of\r\nItalian help and British indifference.\r\n\r\nThe British living in populous centres felt the sudden change of\r\ntemperature. Instead of being the most popular among the foreigners,\r\nthey were suddenly classed with the Italians, who were the most\r\ndetested. This change affected people in various ways. Some stood\r\nfirm and were merely amused at the sudden change; other Englishmen,\r\nmiddle-class gentlemen of pure race who had lived for half a lifetime\r\nin Austria and Hungary, were hastily naturalised. This was hardly a\r\nmatter for surprise. They knew that the goods of British subjects\r\nmight be confiscated and their money forfeited. Having worked all\r\ntheir lives for a competency which they wished to enjoy in their old\r\nage, they were naturally loth to see it disappear before their eyes.\r\nIn their newly-acquired zeal for Austria, however, they could not let\r\nthe matter rest here. They wrote to the local papers saying that they\r\nrenounced their country. They had always regretted their nationality\r\nand had never been happy under the rule of their rightful King. The\r\nAustrians read these ebullitions with surprise. They said that they\r\nwere sorry that these men had chosen to join their nation instead of\r\nanother; they did not want such skunks. The Government then decided to\r\nask all renegades of means to contribute handsomely to the Red Cross\r\nfunds. Those who wished to remain in the country of their adoption must\r\ngive a third of their capital to this object. The newly-made Austrians\r\nhurried off to the British consul, only to discover that, by becoming\r\nnaturalised, they had forfeited all right to the assistance usually\r\ngiven to British subjects.\r\n\r\nIn seaports in Austria and Hungary other Englishmen denounced their\r\nfriends and acted as spies in the service of the Austrian Government.\r\nThey were men of means. Conduct that might be condoned, if not excused,\r\nin members of the poverty-stricken international colony, which knows\r\nno country and floats from capital to capital in search of a bare\r\nsubsistence, was regarded as detestable in men of pure Anglo-Saxon\r\nnationality without the slightest admixture of foreign blood.\r\n\r\nThe women, curiously enough, trusted to the Austrians and Hungarians to\r\ndo them no ill. British diplomatists, fearing for the younger women,\r\ngave their last ready money to get them out before the declaration of\r\nwar; but the English girls were not impressed with the necessity of\r\nleaving. They were convinced that Austria did not intend to imperil her\r\nchance of future negotiation by ill-treating women and children.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was no show of love for the enemy. They\r\npreferred to lose all they possessed rather than to attempt to become\r\nnaturalised. In the same way the British sportsmen went almost to a man\r\nto concentration camps rather than toady to the enemy. These men were\r\nborn in Austria-Hungary for the most part. Many came of families that\r\nwere virtually Austrian, as they had lived generation after generation\r\nin the country. Some sporting instinct had prevented their grandfathers\r\nfrom taking out naturalisation papers. The same feeling stopped the\r\ngrandsons from any truckling to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable result of the war was perhaps the stripping off of\r\nall pretences. People who had always posed as being excessively rich\r\nsuddenly confessed themselves to be paupers or to have lived beyond\r\ntheir means. Brave men became cowards; and people whose courage had\r\noften been doubted were revealed as creatures of the old bulldog\r\ntype. The diplomatist had a difficult time. The consuls dealt out\r\npassports by the hundred. Sometimes, with a dozen girls all clamouring\r\nfor their papers at once and literally hanging on to their coat-tails,\r\nthey looked more like stage-managers surrounded by chorus girls than\r\nanything else. “My dear ladies, we are at war,” a plaintive voice was\r\nheard. “You really must put down the age you look.”... “No, I don’t\r\ndoubt your word; I know you are only twenty-four, but at the frontier\r\nthey will say the passport is stolen.... Forty-five now ... yes, that\r\nis more like it.” “No, it really can’t be done.... As I told the lady\r\nover there, you will have trouble when you want to cross.... We know\r\nyou have had a wearing life, and are really much younger than you look\r\n... six children does take it out of one ... yes, yes ... fifty-five\r\nwill do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA’S AWAKENING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Entrance to these barracks is forbidden.” Sentries stood there to\r\nenforce the new regulation. What did it mean? The steady tramping of\r\ntroops had been heard all night. It was not the irregular tread of\r\nAustrians or Hungarians, who walk rather than march. The new troops\r\nkept step; they moved with the precision of machinery. In a wineshop\r\nround the corner from the barracks old Viennese burghers were sitting,\r\nand although it was only 9 a.m. they were taking their mid-morning\r\nlunch. They ate their rye bread and salami, washed down by white wine\r\nfrom the vineyards on the mountains round the city, which rivalled\r\nchampagne in taste. Slowly and deliberately they discussed recent\r\nevents. Prussian troops had come on in the night. Vienna was under\r\nGerman rule.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian troops were being hurried to the front. Some were going\r\nto Galicia, others towards Servia, and a third lot towards the Italian\r\nfront. “No one knows what the Italians may do.... If only we had\r\nkept on good terms with them, we could face the Germans to-day.” “We\r\nmust not grumble. It was a choice--either fall into the hands of\r\nthe Germans or be overwhelmed with Slavs.” “I prefer the Germans,”\r\nsaid a fair-haired burgher. “They are kinsmen at least.” “Not the\r\nPrussians. You don’t know the Prussians. They are the last word in\r\nunscrupulousness.” “Clever they are, but without any of the finer\r\nfeelings. Save us from the Prussians,” said another. “The Slavs will\r\nprosper in spite of the war.” “They are to be put into the front of\r\nthe battle.” “What will be the use of that? It is only one generation,\r\nand there are large families of children at home.” “The Slav mothers\r\nwill bring up their children to hate us for this. We shall have more\r\nenemies within our borders.” “The German children will die from want\r\nand neglect. Their mothers are accustomed to comfort, even to luxury;\r\nthey cannot till the fields and bring in the crops. But the Slavs,\r\nwho are used to poverty and hardship, will weather the storm.” “Yes,\r\nyou are right; that is all we shall gain from this war--a Slavonic\r\nAustria-Hungary overrun by Serbs and Croats, who will trade with our\r\nCzechs.” “God save us from the Prussians!” That was heard time and\r\ntime again as the Austrians realised that the days of happy-go-lucky\r\ndrifting were over for ever, and that all their affairs were handed\r\nover to the care of Prussians. The Austrian always shows great delicacy\r\nof feeling. He is not far behind the Frenchman in this. The German\r\ndoes not know the significance of the word. His dealings with Austrian\r\nofficials, who were suddenly superseded by Germans, were on the\r\nmailed-fist principle. “The Prussian could not behave decently, even\r\nif he tried!” “Trample upon the weak; fling the incapable into the\r\nstreet!” These were the bitter remarks heard on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe most imposing but saddest sight of all during the mobilisation was\r\nthe arrival of the aged Emperor and his heir in Vienna. The old man,\r\nseated in an open carriage, although the heat was intense, stared at\r\nthe vacancy in front of him. His lips were tightly closed. His heir, a\r\nstripling who looks much younger than his years, looked right and left.\r\nThe crowd cheered and outdid itself in its expressions of loyalty.\r\nThere was no joy in the voices of the people, but a lingering tone\r\nof regret. “Was this the last time that the Emperor would ride by in\r\nstate?” “Was his place to be taken by another?”\r\n\r\nThe Vienna crowd, which had always been sullen and refused to cheer\r\nwhen Kaiser Wilhelm passed through the streets, had gauged events\r\nwith perfect justice. The old man and the stripling--as they called\r\nthe Archduke Carl Francis Joseph--were totally unfit to cope with the\r\nKaiser. The Habsburgs would sink into a subordinate position and be\r\nnothing more than other German princes, once independent, who had sunk\r\ninto subserviency to the Prussians. The people, with dim eyes, cheered\r\nagain. The Emperor had always been popular. His general audiences,\r\nwhere he received all and sundry who had a good case to lay before\r\nhim, his personal courage, which needed no proof, and other kingly\r\nqualities, always endeared him to the crowd. After ordering the\r\nexecution of large numbers of political criminals in the days of his\r\nyouth and middle age, he sought to compensate for this in his old age\r\nby pardoning many criminals. He could not be induced to sign a death\r\nsentence. This mercy shown towards men who richly deserved death for\r\ntheir many crimes made him popular. The crowd saw no discrepancy in\r\nthe acts of a sovereign who would slay a hundred men who attempted to\r\ngain freedom for the country without scruple in his youth, and in fear\r\nof punishment after death, refused to permit wrongdoers to be executed\r\nas the time of his passing away grew nearer. They failed to understand\r\nthe Emperor’s motive. He hoped that Heaven would overlook his former\r\ncrimes towards the subject-peoples if he could show a contra-account of\r\ndeeds of mercy.\r\n\r\nArchduke Carl Francis Joseph wore an imperturbable expression. No\r\none could fathom the state of his mind. Was he merely thinking of\r\nhis own private affairs, or was he concerned for the fate which hung\r\nover Austria-Hungary? Who shall say? Did he prefer to live as a ruler\r\nwithout responsibilities, like the King of Saxony, to the toil of the\r\nlife of a reigning monarch? So many of the Habsburgs have abdicated\r\nwhen the responsibilities of a throne have descended upon them, so many\r\nmembers of the Imperial family have left the pomp and splendour of the\r\nCourt for a quiet life in retirement, that it is difficult to surmise\r\nwhat feelings filled the heart of the young man as he looked forwards\r\nto Armageddon.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s feelings were plain. He had always said, “Après moi le\r\ndéluge,” but he realised that the deluge would not wait for his death.\r\nHis reign, which had begun to the sound of battle and dire defeat, was\r\nto end to the death-song of the Empire. The sceptre that his ancestors\r\nhad confided to him was slipping from his grasp. His adversaries had\r\nbeen too much for him. Kaiser Wilhelm had used methods which were not\r\npermitted even to politicians. He had broken faith with his ally. The\r\nEmperor, the keener man of the two, was too old, and had not suspected\r\nthe depths of falsity under the mask of frank bonhomie. Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nhad even deceived the Church, always the adviser and comforter of the\r\nold Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY R.
