Since the\r\nadjournment of the last Congress our constituents have enjoyed an unusual\r\ndegree of health. The earth has yielded her fruits abundantly and has\r\nbountifully rewarded the toil of the husbandman. Our great staples have\r\ncommanded high prices, and up till within a brief period our manufacturing,\r\nmineral, and mechanical occupations have largely partaken of the general\r\nprosperity. We have possessed all the elements of material wealth in rich\r\nabundance, and yet, notwithstanding all these advantages, our country in\r\nits monetary interests is at the present moment in a deplorable condition.\r\nIn the midst of unsurpassed plenty in all the productions of agriculture\r\nand in all the elements of national wealth, we find our manufactures\r\nsuspended, our public works retarded, our private enterprises of different\r\nkinds abandoned, and thousands of useful laborers thrown out of employment\r\nand reduced to want. The revenue of the Government, which is chiefly\r\nderived from duties on imports from abroad, has been greatly reduced,\r\nwhilst the appropriations made by Congress at its last session for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year are very large in amount.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a loan may be required before the close of your\r\npresent session; but this, although deeply to be regretted, would prove to\r\nbe only a slight misfortune when compared with the suffering and distress\r\nprevailing among the people. With this the Government can not fail deeply\r\nto sympathize, though it may be without the power to extend relief.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty to inquire what has produced such unfortunate results and\r\nwhether their recurrence can be prevented. In all former revulsions the\r\nblame might have been fairly attributed to a variety of cooperating causes,\r\nbut not so upon the present occasion. It is apparent that our existing\r\nmisfortunes have proceeded solely from our extravagant and vicious system\r\nof paper currency and bank credits, exciting the people to wild\r\nspeculations and gambling in stocks. These revulsions must continue to\r\nrecur at successive intervals so long as the amount of the paper currency\r\nand bank loans and discounts of the country shall be left to the discretion\r\nof 1,400 irresponsible banking institutions, which from the very law of\r\ntheir nature will consult the interest of their stockholders rather than\r\nthe public welfare.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, when they gave to Congress the power \"to\r\ncoin money and to regulate the value thereof\" and prohibited the States\r\nfrom coining money, emitting bills of credit, or making anything but gold\r\nand silver coin a tender in payment of debts, supposed they had protected\r\nthe people against the evils of an excessive and irredeemable paper\r\ncurrency. They are not responsible for the existing anomaly that a\r\nGovernment endowed with the sovereign attribute of coining money and\r\nregulating the value thereof should have no power to prevent others from\r\ndriving this coin out of the country and filling up the channels of\r\ncirculation with paper which does not represent gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the highest and most responsible duties of Government to\r\ninsure to the people a sound circulating medium, the amount of which ought\r\nto be adapted with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the wants of\r\ninternal trade and foreign exchanges. If this be either greatly above or\r\ngreatly below the proper standard, the marketable value of every man's\r\nproperty is increased or diminished in the same proportion, and injustice\r\nto individuals as well as incalculable evils to the community are the\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, under the construction of the Federal Constitution which has\r\nnow prevailed too long to be changed this important and delicate duty has\r\nbeen dissevered from the coining power and virtually transferred to more\r\nthan 1,400 State banks acting independently of each other and regulating\r\ntheir paper issues almost exclusively by a regard to the present interest\r\nof their stockholders. Exercising the sovereign power of providing a paper\r\ncurrency instead of coin for the country, the first duty which these banks\r\nowe to the public is to keep in their vaults a sufficient\r\namount of gold and silver to insure the convertibility of\r\ntheir notes into coin at all times and under all circumstances.\r\nNo bank ought ever to be chartered without such restrictions\r\non its business as to secure this result. All other restrictions are\r\ncomparatively vain. This is the only true touchstone, the only efficient\r\nregulator of a paper currency--the only one which can guard the public\r\nagainst overissues and bank suspensions. As a collateral and eventual\r\nsecurity, it is doubtless wise, and in all cases ought to be required, that\r\nbanks shall hold an amount of United States or State securities equal to\r\ntheir notes in circulation and pledged for their redemption. This, however,\r\nfurnishes no adequate security against overissue. On the contrary, it may\r\nbe perverted to inflate the currency. Indeed, it is possible by this means\r\nto convert all the debts of the United States and State Governments into\r\nbank notes, without reference to the specie required to redeem them.\r\nHowever valuable these securities may be in themselves, they can not be\r\nconverted into gold and silver at the moment of pressure, as our experience\r\nteaches, in sufficient time to prevent bank suspensions and the\r\ndepreciation of bank notes. In England, which is to a considerable extent a\r\npaper-money country, though vastly behind our own in this respect, it was\r\ndeemed advisable, anterior to the act of Parliament of 1844, which wisely\r\nseparated the issue of notes from the banking department, for the Bank of\r\nEngland always to keep on hand gold and silver equal to one-third of its\r\ncombined circulation and deposits. If this proportion was no more than\r\nsufficient to secure the convertibility of its notes with the whole of\r\nGreat Britain and to some extent the continent of Europe as a field for its\r\ncirculation, rendering it almost impossible that a sudden and immediate run\r\nto a dangerous amount should be made upon it, the same proportion would\r\ncertainly be insufficient under our banking system. Each of our 1,400 banks\r\nhas but a limited circumference for its circulation, and in the course of a\r\nvery few days the depositors and note holders might demand from such a bank\r\na sufficient amount in specie to compel it to suspend, even although it had\r\ncoin in its vaults equal to one-third of its immediate liabilities. And yet\r\nI am not aware, with the exception of the banks of Louisiana, that any\r\nState bank throughout the Union has been required by its charter to keep\r\nthis or any other proportion of gold and silver compared with the amount of\r\nits combined circulation and deposits. What has been the consequence? In a\r\nrecent report made by the Treasury Department on the condition of the banks\r\nthroughout the different States, according to returns dated nearest to\r\nJanuary, 1857, the aggregate amount of actual specie in their vaults is\r\n$58,349,838, of their circulation $214,778,822, and of their deposits\r\n$230,351,352. Thus it appears that these banks in the aggregate have\r\nconsiderably less than one dollar in seven of gold and silver compared with\r\ntheir circulation and deposits. It was palpable, therefore, that the very\r\nfirst pressure must drive them to suspension and deprive the people of a\r\nconvertible currency, with all its disastrous consequences. It is truly\r\nwonderful that they should have so long continued to preserve their credit\r\nwhen a demand for the payment of one-seventh of their immediate liabilities\r\nwould have driven them into insolvency. And this is the condition of the\r\nbanks, notwithstanding that four hundred millions of gold from California\r\nhave flowed in upon us within the last eight years, and the tide still\r\ncontinues to flow. Indeed, such has been the extravagance of bank credits\r\nthat the banks now hold a considerably less amount of specie, either in\r\nproportion to their capital or to their circulation and deposits combined,\r\nthan they did before the discovery of gold in California. Whilst in the\r\nyear 1848 their specie in proportion to their capital was more than equal\r\nto one dollar for four and a half, in 1857 it does not amount to one dollar\r\nfor every six dollars and thirty-three cents of their capital. In the year\r\n1848 the specie was equal within a very small fraction to one dollar in\r\nfive of their circulation and deposits; in 1857 it is not equal to one\r\ndollar in seven and a half of their circulation and deposits.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement it is easy to account for our financial history for the\r\nlast forty years. It has been a history of extravagant expansions in the\r\nbusiness of the country, followed by ruinous contractions. At successive\r\nintervals the best and most enterprising men have been tempted to their\r\nruin by excessive bank loans of mere paper credit, exciting them to\r\nextravagant importations of foreign goods, wild speculations, and ruinous\r\nand demoralizing stock gambling. When the crisis arrives, as arrive it\r\nmust, the banks can extend no relief to the people. In a vain struggle to\r\nredeem their liabilities in specie they are compelled to contract their\r\nloans and their issues, and at last, in the hour of distress, when their\r\nassistance is most needed, they and their debtors together sink into\r\ninsolvency.\r\n\r\nIt is this paper system of extravagant expansion, raising the nominal price\r\nof every article far beyond its real value when compared with the cost of\r\nsimilar articles in countries whose circulation is wisely regulated, which\r\nhas prevented us from competing in our own markets with foreign\r\nmanufacturers, has produced extravagant importations, and has counteracted\r\nthe effect of the large incidental protection afforded to our domestic\r\nmanufactures by the present revenue tariff. But for this the branches of\r\nour manufactures composed of raw materials, the production of our own\r\ncountry--such as cotton, iron, and woolen fabrics--would not only have\r\nacquired almost exclusive possession of the home market, but would have\r\ncreated for themselves a foreign market throughout the world.\r\n\r\nDeplorable, however, as may be our present financial condition, we may yet\r\nindulge in bright hopes for the future. No other nation has ever existed\r\nwhich could have endured such violent expansions and contractions of paper\r\ncredits without lasting injury; yet the buoyancy of youth, the energies of\r\nour population, and the spirit which never quails before difficulties will\r\nenable us soon to recover from our present financial embarrassments, and\r\nmay even occasion us speedily to forget the lesson which they have taught.\r\nIn the meantime it is the duty of the Government, by all proper means\r\nwithin its power, to aid in alleviating the sufferings of the people\r\noccasioned by the suspension of the banks and to provide against a\r\nrecurrence of the same calamity. Unfortunately, in either aspect of the\r\ncase it can do but little. Thanks to the independent treasury, the\r\nGovernment has not suspended payment, as it was compelled to do by the\r\nfailure of the banks in 1837. It will continue to discharge its liabilities\r\nto the people in gold and silver. Its disbursements in coin will pass into\r\ncirculation and materially assist in restoring a sound currency. From its\r\nhigh credit, should we be compelled to make a temporary loan, it can be\r\neffected on advantageous terms. This, however, shall if possible be\r\navoided, but if not, then the amount shall be limited to the lowest\r\npracticable sum.\r\n\r\nI have therefore determined that whilst no useful Government works already\r\nin progress shall be suspended, new works not already commenced will be\r\npostponed if this can be done without injury to the country. Those\r\nnecessary for its defense shall proceed as though there had been no crisis\r\nin our monetary affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the Federal Government can not do much to provide against a recurrence\r\nof existing evils. Even if insurmountable constitutional objections did not\r\nexist against the creation of a national bank, this would furnish no\r\nadequate preventive security. The history of the last Bank of the United\r\nStates abundantly proves the truth of this assertion. Such a bank could\r\nnot, if it would, regulate the issues and credits of 1,400 State banks in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent the ruinous expansions and contractions in our\r\ncurrency which afflicted the country throughout the existence of the late\r\nbank, or secure us against future suspensions. In 1825 an effort was made\r\nby the Bank of England to curtail the issues of the country banks under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances. The paper currency had been expanded to a\r\nruinous extent, and the bank put forth all its power to contract it in\r\norder to reduce prices and restore the equilibrium of the foreign\r\nexchanges. It accordingly commenced a system of curtailment of its loans\r\nand issues, in the vain hope that the joint stock and private banks of the\r\nKingdom would be compelled to follow its example. It found, however, that\r\nas it contracted they expanded, and at the end of the process, to employ\r\nthe language of a very high official authority, \"whatever reduction of the\r\npaper circulation was effected by the Bank of England (in 1825) was more\r\nthan made up by the issues of the country banks.\"\r\n\r\nBut a bank of the United States would not, if it could, restrain the issues\r\nand loans of the State banks, because its duty as a regulator of the\r\ncurrency must often be in direct conflict with the immediate interest of\r\nits stockholders. If we expect one agent to restrain or control another,\r\ntheir interests must, at least in some degree, be antagonistic. But the\r\ndirectors of a bank of the United States would feel the same interest and\r\nthe same inclination with the directors of the State banks to expand the\r\ncurrency, to accommodate their favorites and friends with loans, and to\r\ndeclare large dividends. Such has been our experience in regard to the last\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we must mainly rely upon the patriotism and wisdom of the States\r\nfor the prevention and redress of the evil. If they will afford us a real\r\nspecie basis for our paper circulation by increasing the denomination of\r\nbank notes, first to twenty and afterwards to fifty dollars; if they will\r\nrequire that the banks shall at all times keep on hand at least one dollar\r\nof gold and silver for every three dollars of their circulation and\r\ndeposits, and if they will provide by a self-executing enactment, which\r\nnothing can arrest, that the moment they suspend they shall go into\r\nliquidation, I believe that such provisions, with a weekly publication by\r\neach bank of a statement of its condition, would go far to secure us\r\nagainst future suspensions of specie payments.\r\n\r\nCongress, in my opinion, possess the power to pass a uniform bankrupt law\r\napplicable to all banking institutions throughout the United States, and I\r\nstrongly recommend its exercise. This would make it the irreversible\r\norganic law of each bank's existence that a suspension of specie payments\r\nshall produce its civil death. The instinct of self-preservation would then\r\ncompel it to perform its duties in such a manner as to escape the penalty\r\nand preserve its life.\r\n\r\nThe existence of banks and the circulation of bank paper are so identified\r\nwith the habits of our people that they can not at this day be suddenly\r\nabolished without much immediate injury to the country. If we could confine\r\nthem to their appropriate sphere and prevent them from administering to the\r\nspirit of wild and reckless speculation by extravagant loans and issues,\r\nthey might be continued with advantage to the public.\r\n\r\nBut this I say, after long and much reflection: If experience shall prove\r\nit to be impossible to enjoy the facilities which well-regulated banks\r\nmight afford without at the same time suffering the calamities which the\r\nexcesses of the banks have hitherto inflicted upon the country, it would\r\nthen be far the lesser evil to deprive them altogether of the power to\r\nissue a paper currency and confine them to the functions of banks of\r\ndeposit and discount.\r\n\r\nOur relations with foreign governments are upon the whole in a satisfactory\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic difficulties which existed between the Government of the\r\nUnited States and that of Great Britain at the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress have been happily terminated by the appointment of a British\r\nminister to this country, who has been cordially received. Whilst it is\r\ngreatly to the interest, as I am convinced it is the sincere desire, of the\r\nGovernments and people of the two countries to be on terms of intimate\r\nfriendship with each other, it has been our misfortune almost always to\r\nhave had some irritating, if not dangerous, outstanding question with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nSince the origin of the Government we have been employed in negotiating\r\ntreaties with that power, and afterwards in discussing their true intent\r\nand meaning. In this respect the convention of April 19, 1850, commonly\r\ncalled the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, has been the most unfortunate of all,\r\nbecause the two Governments place directly opposite and contradictory\r\nconstructions upon its first and most important article. Whilst in the\r\nUnited States we believed that this treaty would place both powers upon an\r\nexact equality by the stipulation that neither will ever \"occupy, or\r\nfortify, or colonize, or assume, or exercise any dominion\" over any part of\r\nCentral America, it is contended by the British Government that the true\r\nconstruction of this language has left them in the rightful possession of\r\nall that portion of Central America which was in their occupancy at the\r\ndate of the treaty; in fact, that the treaty is a virtual recognition on\r\nthe part of the United States of the right of Great Britain, either as\r\nowner or protector, to the whole extensive coast of Central America,\r\nsweeping round from the Rio Hondo to the port and harbor of San Juan de\r\nNicaragua, together with the adjacent Bay Islands, except the comparatively\r\nsmall portion of this between the Sarstoon and Cape Honduras. According to\r\ntheir construction, the treaty does no more than simply prohibit them from\r\nextending their possessions in Central America beyond the present limits.\r\nIt is not too much to assert that if in the United States the treaty had\r\nbeen considered susceptible of such a construction it never would have been\r\nnegotiated under the authority of the President, nor would it have received\r\nthe approbation of the Senate. The universal conviction in the United\r\nStates was that when our Government consented to violate its traditional\r\nand time-honored policy and to stipulate with a foreign government never to\r\noccupy or acquire territory in the Central American portion of our own\r\ncontinent, the consideration for this sacrifice was that Great Britain\r\nshould, in this respect at least, be placed in the same position with\r\nourselves. Whilst we have no right to doubt the sincerity of the British\r\nGovernment in their construction of the treaty, it is at the same time my\r\ndeliberate conviction that this construction is in opposition both to its\r\nletter and its spirit.\r\n\r\nUnder the late Administration negotiations were instituted between the two\r\nGovernments for the purpose, if possible, of removing these difficulties,\r\nand a treaty having this laudable object in view was signed at London on\r\nthe 17th October, 1856, and was submitted by the President to the Senate on\r\nthe following 10th of December. Whether this treaty, either in its original\r\nor amended form, would have accomplished the object intended without giving\r\nbirth to new and embarrassing complications between the two Governments,\r\nmay perhaps be well questioned. Certain it is, however, it was rendered\r\nmuch less objectionable by the different amendments made to it by the\r\nSenate. The treaty as amended was ratified by me on the 12th March, 1857,\r\nand was transmitted to London for ratification by the British Government.\r\nThat Government expressed its willingness to concur in all the amendments\r\nmade by the Senate with the single exception of the clause relating to\r\nRuatan and the other islands in the Bay of Honduras. The article in the\r\noriginal treaty as submitted to the Senate, after reciting that these\r\nislands and their inhabitants \"having been, by a convention bearing date\r\nthe 27th day of August, 1856, between Her Britannic Majesty and the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, constituted and declared a free territory under the\r\nsovereignty of the said Republic of Honduras,\" stipulated that \"the two\r\ncontracting parties do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect in\r\nall future time the independence and rights of the said free territory as a\r\npart of the Republic of Honduras.\"\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of this convention between Great Britain and Honduras\r\nof the 27th August, 1856, it was found that whilst declaring the Bay\r\nIslands to be \"a free territory under the sovereignty of the Republic of\r\nHonduras\" it deprived that Republic of rights without which its sovereignty\r\nover them could scarcely be said to exist. It divided them from the\r\nremainder of Honduras and gave to their inhabitants a separate government\r\nof their own, with legislative, executive, and judicial officers elected by\r\nthemselves. It deprived the Government of Honduras of the taxing power in\r\nevery form and exempted the people of the islands from the performance of\r\nmilitary duty except for their own exclusive defense. It also prohibited\r\nthat Republic from erecting fortifications upon them for their protection,\r\nthus leaving them open to invasion from any quarter; and, finally, it\r\nprovided \"that slavery shall not at any time hereafter be permitted to\r\nexist therein.\"\r\n\r\nHad Honduras ratified this convention, she would have ratified the\r\nestablishment of a state substantially independent within her own limits,\r\nand a state at all times subject to British influence and control.\r\nMoreover, had the United States ratified the treaty with Great Britain in\r\nits original form, we should have been bound \"to recognize and respect in\r\nall future time\" these stipulations to the prejudice of Honduras. Being in\r\ndirect opposition to the spirit and meaning of the Clayton and Bulwer\r\ntreaty as understood in the United States, the Senate rejected the entire\r\nclause, and substituted in its stead a simple recognition of the sovereign\r\nright of Honduras to these islands in the following language: The two\r\ncontracting parties do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect the\r\nislands of Ruatan, Bonaco, Utila, Barbaretta, Helena, and Moral, situate in\r\nthe Bay of Honduras and off the coast of the Republic of Honduras, as under\r\nthe sovereignty and as part of the said Republic of Honduras.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain rejected this amendment, assigning as the only reason that\r\nthe ratifications of the convention of the 27th August, 1856, between her\r\nand Honduras had not been \"exchanged, owing to the hesitation of that\r\nGovernment.\" Had this been done, it is stated that \"Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment would have had little difficulty in agreeing to the modification\r\nproposed by the Senate, which then would have had in effect the same\r\nsignification as the original wording.\" Whether this would have been the\r\neffect, whether the mere circumstance of the exchange of the ratifications\r\nof the British convention with Honduras prior in point of time to the\r\nratification of our treaty with Great Britain would \"in effect\" have had\r\n\"the same signification as the original wording,\" and thus have nullified\r\nthe amendment of the Senate, may well be doubted. It is, perhaps, fortunate\r\nthat the question has never arisen.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, immediately after rejecting the treaty as amended,\r\nproposed to enter into a new treaty with the United States, similar in all\r\nrespects to the treaty which they had just refused to ratify, if the United\r\nStates would consent to add to the Senate's clear and unqualified\r\nrecognition of the sovereignty of Honduras over the Bay Islands the\r\nfollowing conditional stipulation: Whenever and so soon as the Republic of\r\nHonduras shall have concluded and ratified a treaty with Great Britain by\r\nwhich Great Britain shall have ceded and the Republic of Honduras shall\r\nhave accepted the said islands, subject to the provisions and conditions\r\ncontained in such treaty.\r\n\r\nThis proposition was, of course, rejected. After the Senate had refused to\r\nrecognize the British convention with Honduras of the 27th August, 1856,\r\nwith full knowledge of its contents, it was impossible for me, necessarily\r\nignorant of \"the provisions and conditions\" which might be contained in a\r\nfuture convention between the same parties, to sanction them in advance.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that when two nations like Great Britain and the United States,\r\nmutually desirous, as they are, and I trust ever may be, of maintaining the\r\nmost friendly relations with each other, have unfortunately concluded a\r\ntreaty which they understand in senses directly opposite, the wisest course\r\nis to abrogate such a treaty by mutual consent and to commence anew. Had\r\nthis been done promptly, all difficulties in Central America would most\r\nprobably ere this have been adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties.\r\nThe time spent in discussing the meaning of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty\r\nwould have been devoted to this praiseworthy purpose, and the task would\r\nhave been the more easily accomplished because the interest of the two\r\ncountries in Central America is identical, being confined to securing safe\r\ntransits over all the routes across the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nWhilst entertaining these sentiments, I shall, nevertheless, not refuse to\r\ncontribute to any reasonable adjustment of the Central American questions\r\nwhich is not practically inconsistent with the American interpretation of\r\nthe treaty. Overtures for this purpose have been recently made by the\r\nBritish Government in a friendly spirit, which I cordially reciprocate, but\r\nwhether this renewed effort will result in success I am not yet prepared to\r\nexpress an opinion. A brief period will determine.\r\n\r\nWith France our ancient relations of friendship still continue to exist.\r\nThe French Government have in several recent instances, which need not be\r\nenumerated, evinced a spirit of good will and kindness toward our country,\r\nwhich I heartily reciprocate. It is, notwithstanding, much to be regretted\r\nthat two nations whose productions are of such a character as to invite the\r\nmost extensive exchanges and freest commercial intercourse should continue\r\nto enforce ancient and obsolete restrictions of trade against each other.\r\nOur commercial treaty with France is in this respect an exception from our\r\ntreaties with all other commercial nations. It jealously levies\r\ndiscriminating duties both on tonnage and on articles the growth, produce,\r\nor manufacture of the one country when arriving in vessels belonging to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMore than forty years ago, on the 3d March, 1815, Congress passed an act\r\noffering to all nations to admit their vessels laden with their national\r\nproductions into the ports of the United States upon the same terms with\r\nour own vessels provided they would reciprocate to us similar advantages.\r\nThis act confined the reciprocity to the productions of the respective\r\nforeign nations who might enter into the proposed arrangement with the\r\nUnited States. The act of May 24, 1828, removed this restriction and\r\noffered a similar reciprocity to all such vessels without reference to the\r\norigin of their cargoes. Upon these principles our commercial treaties and\r\narrangements have been rounded, except with France, and let us hope that\r\nthis exception may not long exist.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Russia remain, as they have ever been, on the most\r\nfriendly footing. The present Emperor, as well as his predecessors, have\r\nnever failed when the occasion offered to manifest their good will to our\r\ncountry, and their friendship has always been highly appreciated by the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith all other European Governments, except that of Spain, our relations\r\nare as peaceful as we could desire. I regret to say that no progress\r\nwhatever has been made since the adjournment of Congress toward the\r\nsettlement of any of the numerous claims of our citizens against the\r\nSpanish Government. Besides, the outrage committed on our flag by the\r\nSpanish war frigate Ferrolana on the high seas off the coast of Cuba in\r\nMarch, 1855, by firing into the American mail steamer El Dorado and\r\ndetaining and searching her, remains unacknowledged and unredressed. The\r\ngeneral tone and temper of the Spanish Government toward that of the United\r\nStates are much to be regretted. Our present envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to Madrid has asked to be recalled, and it is my\r\npurpose to send out a new minister to Spain with special instructions on\r\nall questions pending between the two Governments, and with a determination\r\nto have them speedily and amicably adjusted if this be possible. In the\r\nmeantime, whenever our minister urges the just claims of our citizens on\r\nthe notice of the Spanish Government he is met with the objection that\r\nCongress has never made the appropriation recommended by President Polk in\r\nhis annual message of December, 1847, \"to be paid to the Spanish Government\r\nfor the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the Amistad case.\" A\r\nsimilar recommendation was made by my immediate predecessor in his message\r\nof December, 1853, and entirely concurring with both in the opinion that\r\nthis indemnity is justly due under the treaty with Spain of the 27th of\r\nOctober, 1795, I earnestly recommend such an appropriation to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty of friendship and commerce was concluded at Constantinople on the\r\n13th December, 1856, between the United States and Persia, the\r\nratifications of which were exchanged at Constantinople on the 13th June,\r\n1857, and the treaty was proclaimed by the President on the 18th August,\r\n1857. This treaty, it is believed, will prove beneficial to American\r\ncommerce. The Shah has manifested an earnest disposition to cultivate\r\nfriendly relations with our country, and has expressed a strong wish that\r\nwe should be represented at Teheran by a minister plenipotentiary; and I\r\nrecommend that an appropriation be made for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRecent occurrences in China have been unfavorable to a revision of the\r\ntreaty with that Empire of the 3d July, 1844, with a view to the security\r\nand extension of our commerce. The twenty-fourth article of this treaty\r\nstipulated for a revision of it in case experience should prove this to be\r\nrequisite, \"in which case the two Governments will, at the expiration of\r\ntwelve years from the date of said convention, treat amicably concerning\r\nthe same by means of suitable persons appointed to conduct such\r\nnegotiations.\" These twelve years expired on the 3d July, 1856, but long\r\nbefore that period it was ascertained that important changes in the treaty\r\nwere necessary, and several fruitless attempts were made by the\r\ncommissioner of the United States to effect these changes. Another effort\r\nwas about to be made for the same purpose by our commissioner in\r\nconjunction with the ministers of England and France, but this was\r\nsuspended by the occurrence of hostilities in the Canton River between\r\nGreat Britain and the Chinese Empire. These hostilities have necessarily\r\ninterrupted the trade of all nations with Canton, which is now in a state\r\nof blockade, and have occasioned a serious loss of life and property.\r\nMeanwhile the insurrection within the Empire against the existing imperial\r\ndynasty still continues, and it is difficult to anticipate what will be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have deemed it advisable to appoint a\r\ndistinguished citizen of Pennsylvania envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary to proceed to China and to avail himself of any\r\nopportunities which may offer to effect changes in the existing treaty\r\nfavorable to American commerce. He left the United States for the place of\r\nhis destination in July last in the war steamer Minnesota. Special\r\nministers to China have also been appointed by the Governments of Great\r\nBritain and France.\r\n\r\nWhilst our minister has been instructed to occupy a neutral position in\r\nreference to the existing hostilities at Canton, he will cordially\r\ncooperate with the British and French ministers in all peaceful measures to\r\nsecure by treaty stipulations those just concessions to commerce which the\r\nnations of the world have a right to expect and which China can not long be\r\npermitted to withhold. From assurances received I entertain no doubt that\r\nthe three ministers will act in harmonious concert to obtain similar\r\ncommercial treaties for each of the powers they represent.\r\n\r\nWe can not fail to feel a deep interest in all that concerns the welfare of\r\nthe independent Republics on our own continent, as well as of the Empire of\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties with New Granada, which a short time since bore so\r\nthreatening an aspect, are, it is to be hoped, in a fair train of\r\nsettlement in a manner just and honorable to both parties.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus of Central America, including that of Panama, is the great\r\nhighway between the Atlantic and Pacific over which a large portion of the\r\ncommerce of the world is destined to pass. The United States are more\r\ndeeply interested than any other nation in preserving the freedom and\r\nsecurity of all the communications across this isthmus. It is our duty,\r\ntherefore, to take care that they shall not be interrupted either by\r\ninvasions from our own country or by wars between the independent States of\r\nCentral America. Under our treaty with New Granada of the 12th December,\r\n1846, we are bound to guarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus of Panama,\r\nthrough which the Panama Railroad passes, \"as well as the rights of\r\nsovereignty and property which New Granada has and possesses over the said\r\nterritory.\" This obligation is rounded upon equivalents granted by the\r\ntreaty to the Government and people of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I recommend to Congress the passage of an act\r\nauthorizing the President, in case of necessity, to employ the land and\r\nnaval forces of the United States to carry into effect this guaranty of\r\nneutrality and protection. I also recommend similar legislation for the\r\nsecurity of any other route across the Isthmus in which we may acquire an\r\ninterest by treaty.\r\n\r\nWith the independent Republics on this continent it is both our duty and\r\nour interest to cultivate the most friendly relations. We can never feel\r\nindifferent to their fate, and must always rejoice in their prosperity.\r\nUnfortunately both for them and for us, our example and advice have lost\r\nmuch of their influence in consequence of the lawless expeditions which\r\nhave been fitted out against some of them within the limits of our country.\r\nNothing is better calculated to retard our steady material progress or\r\nimpair our character as a nation than the toleration of such enterprises in\r\nviolation of the law of nations.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the first and highest duties of any independent state in its\r\nrelations with the members of the great family of nations to restrain its\r\npeople from acts of hostile aggression against their citizens or subjects.\r\nThe most eminent writers on public law do not hesitate to denounce such\r\nhostile acts as robbery and murder.\r\n\r\nWeak and feeble states like those of Central America may not feel\r\nthemselves able to assert and vindicate their rights. The case would be far\r\ndifferent if expeditions were set on foot within our own territories to\r\nmake private war against a powerful nation. If such expeditions were fitted\r\nout from abroad against any portion of our own country, to burn down our\r\ncities, murder and plunder our people, and usurp our Government, we should\r\ncall any power on earth to the strictest account for not preventing such\r\nenormities.\r\n\r\nEver since the Administration of General Washington acts of Congress have\r\nbeen enforced to punish severely the crime of setting on foot a military\r\nexpedition within the limits of the United States to proceed from thence\r\nagainst a nation or state with whom we are at peace. The present neutrality\r\nact of April 20, 1818, is but little more than a collection of preexisting\r\nlaws. Under this act the President is empowered to employ the land and\r\nnaval forces and the militia \"for the purpose of preventing the carrying on\r\nof any such expedition or enterprise from the territories and jurisdiction\r\nof the United States,\" and the collectors of customs are authorized and\r\nrequired to detain any vessel in port when there is reason to believe she\r\nis about to take part in such lawless enterprises.\r\n\r\nWhen it was first rendered probable that an attempt would be made to get up\r\nanother unlawful expedition against Nicaragua, the Secretary of State\r\nissued instructions to the marshals and district attorneys, which were\r\ndirected by the Secretaries of War and the Navy to the appropriate army and\r\nnavy officers, requiring them to be vigilant and to use their best\r\nexertions in carrying into effect the provisions of the act of 1818.\r\nNotwithstanding these precautions, the expedition has escaped from our\r\nshores. Such enterprises can do no possible good to the country, but have\r\nalready inflicted much injury both on its interests and its character. They\r\nhave prevented peaceful emigration from the United States to the States of\r\nCentral America, which could not fail to prove highly beneficial to all the\r\nparties concerned. In a pecuniary point of view alone our citizens have\r\nsustained heavy losses from the seizure and closing of the transit route by\r\nthe San Juan between the two oceans.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the recent expedition was arrested at New Orleans, but was\r\ndischarged on giving bail for his appearance in the insufficient sum of\r\n$2,000.\r\n\r\nI commend the whole subject to the serious attention of Congress, believing\r\nthat our duty and our interest, as well as our national character, require\r\nthat we should adopt such measures as will be effectual in restraining our\r\ncitizens from committing such outrages.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that the President of Paraguay has refused to ratify\r\nthe treaty between the United States and that State as amended by the\r\nSenate, the signature of which was mentioned in the message of my\r\npredecessor to Congress at the opening of its session in December, 1853.\r\nThe reasons assigned for this refusal will appear in the correspondence\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nIt being desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river La Plata and its\r\ntributaries for navigation by steam, the United States steamer Water Witch\r\nwas sent thither for that purpose in 1853. This enterprise was successfully\r\ncarried on until February, 1855, when, whilst in the peaceful prosecution\r\nof her voyage up the Parana River, the steamer was fired upon by a\r\nParaguayan fort. The fire was returned, but as the Water Witch was of small\r\nforce and not designed for offensive operations, she retired from the\r\nconflict. The pretext upon which the attack was made was a decree of the\r\nPresident of Paraguay of October, 1854, prohibiting foreign vessels of war\r\nfrom navigating the rivers of that State. As Paraguay, however, was the\r\nowner of but one bank of the river of that name, the other belonging to\r\nCorientes, a State of the Argentine Confederation, the right of its\r\nGovernment to expect that such a decree would be obeyed can not be\r\nacknowledged. But the Water Witch was not, properly speaking, a vessel of\r\nwar. She was a small steamer engaged in a scientific enterprise intended\r\nfor the advantage of commercial states generally. Under these circumstances\r\nI am constrained to consider the attack upon her as unjustifiable and as\r\ncalling for satisfaction from the Paraguayan Government.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States also who were established in business in\r\nParaguay have had their property seized and taken from them, and have\r\notherwise been treated by the authorities in an insulting and arbitrary\r\nmanner, which requires redress.\r\n\r\nA demand for these purposes will be made in a firm but conciliatory spirit.\r\nThis will the more probably be granted if the Executive shall have\r\nauthority to use other means in the event of a refusal. This is accordingly\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to state in detail the alarming condition of the\r\nTerritory of Kansas at the time of my inauguration. The opposing parties\r\nthen stood in hostile array against each other, and any accident might have\r\nrelighted the flames of civil war. Besides, at this critical moment Kansas\r\nwas left without a governor by the resignation of Governor Geary.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February previous the Territorial legislature had passed a\r\nlaw providing for the election of delegates on the third Monday of June to\r\na convention to meet on the first Monday of September for the purpose of\r\nframing a constitution preparatory to admission into the Union. This law\r\nwas in the main fair and just, and it is to be regretted that all the\r\nqualified electors had not registered themselves and voted under its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the election for delegates an extensive organization existed\r\nin the Territory whose avowed object it was, if need be, to put down the\r\nlawful government by force and to establish a government of their own under\r\nthe so-called Topeka constitution. The persons attached to this\r\nrevolutionary organization abstained from taking any part in the election.\r\n\r\nThe act of the Territorial legislature had omitted to provide for\r\nsubmitting to the people the constitution which might be framed by the\r\nconvention, and in the excited state of public feeling throughout Kansas an\r\napprehension extensively prevailed that a design existed to force upon them\r\na constitution in relation to slavery against their will. In this emergency\r\nit became my duty, as it was my unquestionable right, having in view the\r\nunion of all good citizens in support of the Territorial laws, to express\r\nan opinion on the true construction of the provisions concerning slavery\r\ncontained in the organic act of Congress of the 30th May, 1854. Congress\r\ndeclared it to be \"the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate\r\nslavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to\r\nleave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way.\" Under it Kansas, \"when admitted as a\r\nState,\" was to \"be received into the Union with or without slavery, as\r\ntheir constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.\"\r\n\r\nDid Congress mean by this language that the delegates elected to frame a\r\nconstitution should have authority finally to decide the question of\r\nslavery, or did they intend by leaving it to the people that the people of\r\nKansas themselves should decide this question by a direct vote? On this\r\nsubject I confess I had never entertained a serious doubt, and therefore in\r\nmy instructions to Governor Walker of the 28th March last I merely said\r\nthat when \"a constitution shall be submitted to the people of the Territory\r\nthey must be protected in the exercise of their right of voting for or\r\nagainst that instrument, and the fair expression of the popular will must\r\nnot be interrupted by fraud or violence.\"\r\n\r\nIn expressing this opinion it was far from my intention to interfere with\r\nthe decision of the people of Kansas, either for or against slavery. From\r\nthis I have always carefully abstained. Intrusted with the duty of taking\r\n\"care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" my only desire was that the\r\npeople of Kansas should furnish to Congress the evidence required by the\r\norganic act, whether for or against slavery, and in this manner smooth\r\ntheir passage into the Union. In emerging from the condition of Territorial\r\ndependence into that of a sovereign State it was their duty, in my opinion,\r\nto make known their will by the votes of the majority on the direct\r\nquestion whether this important domestic institution should or should not\r\ncontinue to exist. Indeed, this was the only possible mode in which their\r\nwill could be authentically ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe election of delegates to a convention must necessarily take place in\r\nseparate districts. From this cause it may readily happen, as has often\r\nbeen the case, that a majority of the people of a State or Territory are on\r\none side of a question, whilst a majority of the representatives from the\r\nseveral districts into which it is divided may be upon the other side. This\r\narises front the fact that in some districts delegates may be elected by\r\nsmall majorities, whilst in others those of different sentiments may\r\nreceive majorities sufficiently great not only to overcome the votes given\r\nfor the former, but to leave a large majority of the whole people in direct\r\nopposition to a majority of the delegates. Besides, our history proves that\r\ninfluences may be brought to bear on the representative sufficiently\r\npowerful to induce him to disregard the will of his constituents. The truth\r\nis that no other authentic and satisfactory mode exists of ascertaining the\r\nwill of a majority of the people of any State or Territory on an important\r\nand exciting question like that of slavery in Kansas except by leaving it\r\nto a direct vote. How wise, then, was it for Congress to pass over all\r\nsubordinate and intermediate agencies and proceed directly to the source of\r\nall legitimate power under our institutions!\r\n\r\nHow vain would any other principle prove in practice! This may be\r\nillustrated by the case of Kansas. Should she be admitted into the Union\r\nwith a constitution either maintaining or abolishing slavery against the\r\nsentiment of the people, this could have no other effect than to continue\r\nand to exasperate the existing agitation during the brief period required\r\nto make the constitution conform to the irresistible will of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe friends and supporters of the Nebraska and Kansas act, when struggling\r\non a recent occasion to sustain its wise provisions before the great\r\ntribunal of the American people, never differed about its true meaning on\r\nthis subject. Everywhere throughout the Union they publicly pledged their\r\nfaith and their honor that they would cheerfully submit the question of\r\nslavery to the decision of the bona fide people of Kansas, without any\r\nrestriction or qualification whatever. All were cordially united upon the\r\ngreat doctrine of popular sovereignty, which is the vital principle of our\r\nfree institutions. Had it then been insinuated from any quarter that it\r\nwould be a sufficient compliance with the requisitions of the organic law\r\nfor the members of a convention thereafter to be elected to withhold the\r\nquestion of slavery from the people and to substitute their own will for\r\nthat of a legally ascertained majority of all their constituents, this\r\nwould have been instantly rejected. Everywhere they remained true to the\r\nresolution adopted on a celebrated occasion recognizing \"the right of the\r\npeople of all the Territories, including Kansas and Nebraska, acting\r\nthrough the legally and fairly expressed will of a majority of actual\r\nresidents, and whenever the number of their inhabitants justifies it, to\r\nform a constitution with or without slavery and be admitted into the Union\r\nupon terms of perfect equality with the other States.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention to frame a constitution for Kansas met on the first Monday\r\nof September last. They were called together by virtue of an act of the\r\nTerritorial legislature, whose lawful existence had been recognized by\r\nCongress in different forms and by different enactments. A large proportion\r\nof the citizens of Kansas did not think proper to register their names and\r\nto vote at the election for delegates; but an opportunity to do this having\r\nbeen fairly afforded, their refusal to avail themselves of their right\r\ncould in no manner affect the legality of the convention. This convention\r\nproceeded to frame a constitution for Kansas, and finally adjourned on the\r\n7th day of November. But little difficulty occurred in the convention\r\nexcept on the subject of slavery. The truth is that the general provisions\r\nof our recent State constitutions are so similar and, I may add, so\r\nexcellent that the difference between them is not essential. Under the\r\nearlier practice of the Government no constitution framed by the convention\r\nof a Territory preparatory to its admission into the Union as a State had\r\nbeen submitted to the people. I trust, however, the example set by the last\r\nCongress, requiring that the constitution of Minnesota \"should be subject\r\nto the approval and ratification of the people of the proposed State,\" may\r\nbe followed on future occasions. I took it for granted that the convention\r\nof Kansas would act in accordance with this example, rounded, as it is, on\r\ncorrect principles, and hence my instructions to Governor Walker in favor\r\nof submitting the constitution to the people were expressed in general and\r\nunqualified terms.\r\n\r\nIn the Kansas-Nebraska act, however, this requirement, as applicable to the\r\nwhole constitution, had not been inserted, and the convention were not\r\nbound by its terms to submit any other portion of the instrument to an\r\nelection except that which relates to the \"domestic institution\" of\r\nslavery. This will be rendered clear by a simple reference to its language.\r\nIt was \"not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to\r\nexclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\r\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.\" According\r\nto the plain construction of the sentence, the words \"domestic\r\ninstitutions\" have a direct, as they have an appropriate, reference to\r\nslavery. \"Domestic institutions\" are limited to the family. The relation\r\nbetween master and slave and a few others are \"domestic institutions,\" and\r\nare entirely distinct from institutions of a political character. Besides,\r\nthere was no question then before Congress, nor, indeed, has there since\r\nbeen any serious question before the people of Kansas or the country,\r\nexcept that which relates to the \"domestic institution\" of slavery. The\r\nconvention, after an angry and excited debate, finally determined, by a\r\nmajority of only two, to submit the question of slavery to the people,\r\nthough at the last forty-three of the fifty delegates present affixed their\r\nsignatures to the constitution.\r\n\r\nA large majority of the convention were in favor of establishing slavery in\r\nKansas. They accordingly inserted an article in the constitution for this\r\npurpose similar in form to those which had been adopted by other\r\nTerritorial conventions. In the schedule, however, providing for the\r\ntransition from a Territorial to a State government the question has been\r\nfairly and explicitly referred to the people whether they will have a\r\nconstitution \"with or without slavery.\" It declares that before the\r\nconstitution adopted by the convention \"shall be sent to Congress for\r\nadmission into the Union as a State\" an election shall be held to decide\r\nthis question, at which all the white male inhabitants of the Territory\r\nabove the age of 21 are entitled to vote. They are to vote by ballot, and\r\n\"the ballots cast at said election shall be indorsed 'constitution with\r\nslavery' and 'constitution with no slavery.'\" If there be a majority in\r\nfavor of the \"constitution with slavery,\" then it is to be transmitted to\r\nCongress by the president of the convention in its original form; if, on\r\nthe contrary, there shall be a majority in favor of the \"constitution with\r\nno slavery,\" \"then the article providing for slavery shall be stricken from\r\nthe constitution by the president of this convention;\" and it is expressly\r\ndeclared that \"no slavery shall exist in the State of Kansas, except that\r\nthe right of property in slaves now in the Territory shall in no manner be\r\ninterfered with;\" and in that event it is made his duty to have the\r\nconstitution thus ratified transmitted to the Congress of the United States\r\nfor the admission of the State into the Union.\r\n\r\nAt this election every citizen will have an opportunity of expressing his\r\nopinion by his vote \"whether Kansas shall be received into the Union with\r\nor without slavery,\" and thus this exciting question may be peacefully\r\nsettled in the very mode required by the organic law. The election will be\r\nheld under legitimate authority, and if any portion of the inhabitants\r\nshall refuse to vote, a fair opportunity to do so having been presented,\r\nthis will be their own voluntary act and they alone will be responsible for\r\nthe consequences.\r\n\r\nWhether Kansas shall be a free or a slave State must eventually, under some\r\nauthority, be decided by an election; and the question can never be more\r\nclearly or distinctly presented to the people than it is at the present\r\nmoment. Should this opportunity be rejected she may be involved for years\r\nin domestic discord, and possibly in civil war, before she can again make\r\nup the issue now so fortunately tendered and again reach the point she has\r\nalready attained.\r\n\r\nKansas has for some years occupied too much of the public attention. It is\r\nhigh time this should be directed to far more important objects. When once\r\nadmitted into the Union, whether with or without slavery, the excitement\r\nbeyond her own limits will speedily pass away, and she will then for the\r\nfirst time be left, as she ought to have been long since, to manage her own\r\naffairs in her own way. If her constitution on the subject of slavery or on\r\nany other subject be displeasing to a majority of the people, no human\r\npower can prevent them from changing it within a brief period. Under these\r\ncircumstances it may well be questioned whether the peace and quiet of the\r\nwhole country are not of greater importance than the mere temporary triumph\r\nof either of the political parties in Kansas.\r\n\r\nShould the constitution without slavery be adopted by the votes of the\r\nmajority, the rights of property in slaves now in the Territory are\r\nreserved. The number of these is very small, but if it were greater the\r\nprovision would be equally just and reasonable. The slaves were brought\r\ninto the Territory under the Constitution of the United States and are now\r\nthe property of their masters. This point has at length been finally\r\ndecided by the highest judicial tribunal of the country, and this upon the\r\nplain principle that when a confederacy of sovereign States acquire a new\r\nterritory at their joint expense both equality and justice demand that the\r\ncitizens of one and all of them shall have the right to take into it\r\nwhatsoever is recognized as property by the common Constitution. To have\r\nsummarily confiscated the property in slaves already in the Territory would\r\nhave been an act of gross injustice and contrary to the practice of the\r\nolder States of the Union which have abolished slavery.\r\n\r\nA Territorial government was established for Utah by act of Congress\r\napproved the 9th September, 1850, and the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States were thereby extended over it \"so far as the same or any\r\nprovisions thereof may be applicable.\" This act provided for the\r\nappointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, of a governor (who was to be ex officio superintendent of Indian\r\naffairs), a secretary, three judges of the supreme court, a marshal, and a\r\ndistrict attorney. Subsequent acts provided for the appointment of the\r\nofficers necessary to extend our land and our Indian system over the\r\nTerritory. Brigham Young was appointed the first governor on the 20th\r\nSeptember, 1850, and has held the office ever since. Whilst Governor Young\r\nhas been both governor and superintendent of Indian affairs throughout this\r\nperiod, he has been at the same time the head of the church called the\r\nLatter-day Saints, and professes to govern its members and dispose of their\r\nproperty by direct inspiration and authority from the Almighty. His power\r\nhas been, therefore, absolute over both church and state.\r\n\r\nThe people of Utah almost exclusively belong to this church, and believing\r\nwith a fanatical spirit that he is governor of the Territory by divine\r\nappointment, they obey his commands as if these were direct revelations\r\nfrom Heaven. If, therefore, he chooses that his government shall come into\r\ncollision with the Government of the United States, the members of the\r\nMormon Church will yield implicit obedience to his will. Unfortunately,\r\nexisting facts leave but little doubt that such is his determination.\r\nWithout entering upon a minute history of occurrences, it is sufficient to\r\nsay that all the officers of the United States, judicial and executive,\r\nwith the single exception of two Indian agents, have found it necessary for\r\ntheir own personal safety to withdraw from the Territory, and there no\r\nlonger remains any government in Utah but the despotism of Brigham Young.\r\nThis being the condition of affairs in the Territory, I could not mistake\r\nthe path of duty. As Chief Executive Magistrate I was bound to restore the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution and laws within its limits. In order to\r\neffect this purpose, I appointed a new governor and other Federal officers\r\nfor Utah and sent with them a military force for their protection and to\r\naid as a posse comitatus in case of need in the execution of the laws.\r\n\r\nWith the religious opinions of the Mormons, as long as they remained mere\r\nopinions, however deplorable in themselves and revolting to the moral and\r\nreligious sentiments of all Christendom, I had no right to interfere.\r\nActions alone, when in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, become the legitimate subjects for the jurisdiction of the civil\r\nmagistrate. My instructions to Governor Cumming have therefore been framed\r\nin strict accordance with these principles. At their date a hope was\r\nindulged that no necessity might exist for employing the military in\r\nrestoring and maintaining the authority of the law, but this hope has now\r\nvanished. Governor Young has by proclamation declared his determination to\r\nmaintain his power by force, and has already committed acts of hostility\r\nagainst the United States. Unless he should retrace his steps the Territory\r\nof Utah will be in a state of open rebellion. He has committed these acts\r\nof hostility notwithstanding Major Van Vliet, an officer of the Army, sent\r\nto Utah by the Commanding General to purchase provisions for the troops,\r\nhad given him the strongest assurances of the peaceful intentions of the\r\nGovernment, and that the troops would only be employed as a posse comitatus\r\nwhen called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the laws.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that Governor Young has long contemplated this\r\nresult. He knows that the continuance of his despotic power depends upon\r\nthe exclusion of all settlers from the Territory except those who will\r\nacknowledge his divine mission and implicitly obey his will, and that an\r\nenlightened public opinion there would soon prostrate institutions at war\r\nwith the laws both of God and man. \"He has therefore for several years, in\r\norder to maintain his independence, been industriously employed in\r\ncollecting and fabricating arms and munitions of war and in disciplining\r\nthe Mormons for military service.\" As superintendent of Indian affairs he\r\nhas had an opportunity of tampering with the Indian tribes and exciting\r\ntheir hostile feelings against the United States. This, according to our\r\ninformation, he has accomplished in regard to some of these tribes, while\r\nothers have remained true to their allegiance and have communicated his\r\nintrigues to our Indian agents. He has laid in a store of provisions for\r\nthree years, which in case of necessity, as he informed Major Van Vliet, he\r\nwill conceal, \"and then take to the mountains and bid defiance to all the\r\npowers of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nA great part of all this may be idle boasting, but yet no wise government\r\nwill lightly estimate the efforts which may be inspired by such frenzied\r\nfanaticism as exists among the Mormons in Utah. This is the first rebellion\r\nwhich has existed in our Territories, and humanity itself requires that we\r\nshould put it down in such a manner that it shall be the last. To trifle\r\nwith it would be to encourage it and to render it formidable. We ought to\r\ngo there with such an imposing force as to convince these deluded people\r\nthat resistance would be vain, and thus spare the effusion of blood. We can\r\nin this manner best convince them that we are their friends, not their\r\nenemies. In order to accomplish this object it will be necessary, according\r\nto the estimate of the War Department, to raise four additional regiments;\r\nand this I earnestly recommend to Congress. At the present moment of\r\ndepression in the revenues of the country I am sorry to be obliged to\r\nrecommend such a measure; but I feel confident of the support of Congress,\r\ncost what it may, in suppressing the insurrection and in restoring and\r\nmaintaining the sovereignty of the Constitution and laws over the Territory\r\nof Utah.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress the establishment of a Territorial government over\r\nArizona, incorporating with it such portions of New Mexico as they may deem\r\nexpedient. I need scarcely adduce arguments in support of this\r\nrecommendation. We are bound to protect the lives and the property of our\r\ncitizens inhabiting Arizona, and these are now without any efficient\r\nprotection. Their present number is already considerable, and is rapidly\r\nincreasing, notwithstanding the disadvantages under which they labor.\r\nBesides, the proposed Territory is believed to be rich in mineral and\r\nagricultural resources, especially in silver and copper. The mails of the\r\nUnited States to California are now carried over it throughout its whole\r\nextent, and this route is known to be the nearest and believed to be the\r\nbest to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLong experience has deeply convinced me that a strict construction of the\r\npowers granted to Congress is the only true, as well as the only safe,\r\ntheory of the Constitution. Whilst this principle shall guide my public\r\nconduct, I consider it clear that under the war-making power Congress may\r\nappropriate money for the Construction of a military road through the\r\nTerritories of the United States when this is absolutely necessary for the\r\ndefense of any of the States against foreign invasion. The Constitution has\r\nconferred upon Congress power \"to declare war,\" \"to raise and support\r\narmies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" and to call forth the militia to\r\n\"repel invasions.\" These high sovereign powers necessarily involve\r\nimportant and responsible public duties, and among them there is none so\r\nsacred and so imperative as that of preserving our soil from the invasion\r\nof a foreign enemy. The Constitution has therefore left nothing on this\r\npoint to construction, but expressly requires that \"the United States shall\r\nprotect each of them [the States] against invasion.\" Now if a military road\r\nover our own Territories be indispensably necessary to enable us to meet\r\nand repel the invader, it follows as a necessary consequence not only that\r\nwe possess the power, but it is our imperative duty to construct such a\r\nroad. It would be an absurdity to invest a government with the unlimited\r\npower to make and conduct war and at the same time deny to it the only\r\nmeans of reaching and defeating the enemy at the frontier. Without such a\r\nroad it is quite evident we can not \"protect\" California and our Pacific\r\npossessions \"against invasion.\" We can not by any other means transport men\r\nand munitions of war from the Atlantic States in sufficient time\r\nsuccessfully to defend these remote and distant portions of the Republic.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that the routes across the isthmus of Central America\r\nare at best but a very uncertain and unreliable mode of communication. But\r\neven if this were not the case, they would at once be closed against us in\r\nthe event of war with a naval power so much stronger than our own as to\r\nenable it to blockade the ports at either end of these routes. After all,\r\ntherefore, we can only rely upon a military road through our own\r\nTerritories; and ever since the origin of the Government Congress has been\r\nin the practice of appropriating money from the public Treasury for the\r\nconstruction of such roads.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and the expense of constructing a military railroad to\r\nconnect our Atlantic and Pacific States have been greatly exaggerated. The\r\ndistance on the Arizona route, near the thirty-second parallel of north\r\nlatitude, between the western boundary of Texas, on the Rio Grande, and the\r\neastern boundary of California, on the Colorado, from the best explorations\r\nnow within our knowledge, does not exceed 470 miles, and the face of the\r\ncountry is in the main favorable. For obvious reasons the Government ought\r\nnot to undertake the work itself by means of its own agents. This ought to\r\nbe committed to other agencies, which Congress might assist, either by\r\ngrants of land or money, or by both, upon such terms and conditions as they\r\nmay deem most beneficial for the country. Provision might thus be made not\r\nonly for the safe, rapid, and economical transportation of troops and\r\nmunitions of war, but also of the public mails. The commercial interests of\r\nthe whole country, both East and West, would be greatly promoted by such a\r\nroad, and, above all, it would be a powerful additional bond of union. And\r\nalthough advantages of this kind, whether postal, commercial, or political,\r\ncan not confer constitutional power, yet they may furnish auxiliary\r\narguments in favor of expediting a work which, in my judgment, is clearly\r\nembraced within the war-making power.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I commend to the friendly consideration of Congress the\r\nsubject of the Pacific Railroad, without finally committing myself to any\r\nparticular route.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will furnish a detailed\r\nstatement of the condition of the public finances and of the respective\r\nbranches of the public service devolved upon that Department of the\r\nGovernment. By this report it appears that the amount of revenue received\r\nfrom all sources into the Treasury during the fiscal year ending the 30th\r\nJune, 1857, was $68,631,513.67, which amount, with the balance of\r\n$19,901,325.45 remaining in the Treasury at the commencement of the year,\r\nmade an aggregate for the service of the year of $88,532,839.12.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1857,\r\namounted to $70,822,724.85, of which $5,943,896.91 were applied to the\r\nredemption of the public debt, including interest and premium, leaving in\r\nthe Treasury at the commencement of the present fiscal year, on the 1st\r\nJuly, 1857, $17,710,114.27.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the first quarter of the present fiscal\r\nyear, commencing 1st July, 1857, were $20,929,819.81, and the estimated\r\nreceipts of the remaining three quarters to the 30th June, 1858, are\r\n$36,750,000, making, with the balance before stated, an aggregate of\r\n$75,389,934.08 for the service of the present fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year\r\nwere $23,714,528.37, of which $3,895,232.39 were applied to the redemption\r\nof the public debt, including interest and premium. The probable\r\nexpenditures of the remaining three quarters to 30th June, 1858, are\r\n$51,248,530.04, including interest on the public debt, making an aggregate\r\nof $74,963,058.41, leaving an estimated balance in the Treasury at the\r\nclose of the present fiscal year of $426,875.67.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal\r\nyear was $29,060,386.90.\r\n\r\nThe amount redeemed since the 1st of July was $3,895,232.39, leaving a\r\nbalance unredeemed at this time of $25,165,154.51.\r\n\r\nThe amount of estimated expenditures for the remaining three quarters of\r\nthe present fiscal year will in all probability be increased from the\r\ncauses set forth in the report of the Secretary. His suggestion, therefore,\r\nthat authority should be given to supply any temporary deficiency by the\r\nissue of a limited amount of Treasury notes is approved, and I accordingly\r\nrecommend the passage of such a law.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the report of the Secretary, the tariff of March 3, 1857, has\r\nbeen in operation for so short a period of time and under circumstances so\r\nunfavorable to a just development of its results as a revenue measure that\r\nI should regard it as inexpedient, at least for the present, to undertake\r\nits revision.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports made to me by the Secretaries of War and of\r\nthe Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. They all contain\r\nvaluable and important information and suggestions, which I commend to the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have already recommended the raising of four additional regiments, and\r\nthe report of the Secretary of War presents strong reasons proving this\r\nincrease of the Army under existing circumstances to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nI would call the special attention of Congress to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy in favor of the construction of ten small war\r\nsteamers of light draft. For some years the Government has been obliged on\r\nmany occasions to hire such steamers from individuals to supply its\r\npressing wants. At the present moment we have no armed vessel in the Navy\r\nwhich can penetrate the rivers of China. We have but few which can enter\r\nany of the harbors south of Norfolk, although many millions of foreign and\r\ndomestic commerce annually pass in and out of these harbors. Some of our\r\nmost valuable interests and most vulnerable points are thus left exposed.\r\nThis class of vessels of light draft, great speed, and heavy guns would be\r\nformidable in coast defense. The cost of their construction will not be\r\ngreat and they will require but a comparatively small expenditure to keep\r\nthem in commission. In time of peace they will prove as effective as much\r\nlarger vessels and more useful. One of them should be at every station\r\nwhere we maintain a squadron, and three or four should be constantly\r\nemployed on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Economy, utility, and\r\nefficiency combine to recommend them as almost indispensable. Ten of these\r\nsmall vessels would be of incalculable advantage to the naval service, and\r\nthe whole cost of their construction would not exceed $2,300,000, or\r\n$230,000 each.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior is worthy of grave\r\nconsideration. It treats of the numerous important and diversified branches\r\nof domestic administration intrusted to him by law. Among these the most\r\nprominent are the public lands and our relations with the Indians. Our\r\nsystem for the disposal of the public lands, originating with the fathers\r\nof the Republic, has been improved as experience pointed the way, and\r\ngradually adapted to the growth and settlement of our Western States and\r\nTerritories. It has worked well in practice. Already thirteen States and\r\nseven Territories have been carved out of these lands, and still more than\r\na thousand millions of acres remain unsold. What a boundless prospect this\r\npresents to our country of future prosperity and power!\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore disposed of 363,862,464 acres of the public land. Whilst\r\nthe public lands, as a source of revenue, are of great importance, their\r\nimportance is far greater as furnishing homes for a hardy and independent\r\nrace of honest and industrious citizens who desire to subdue and cultivate\r\nthe soil. They ought to be administered mainly with a view of promoting\r\nthis wise and benevolent policy. In appropriating them for any other\r\npurpose we ought to use even greater economy than if they had been\r\nconverted into money and the proceeds were already in the public Treasury.\r\nTo squander away this richest and noblest inheritance which any people have\r\never enjoyed upon objects of doubtful constitutionality or expediency would\r\nbe to violate one of the most important trusts ever committed to any\r\npeople. Whilst I do not deny to Congress the power, when acting bona fide\r\nas a proprietor, to give away portions of them for the purpose of\r\nincreasing the value of the remainder, yet, considering the great\r\ntemptation to abuse this power, we can not be too cautious in its exercise.\r\nActual settlers under existing laws are protected against other purchasers\r\nat the public sales in their right of preemption to the extent of a quarter\r\nsection, or 160 acres, of land. The remainder may then be disposed of at\r\npublic or entered at private sale in unlimited quantities. Speculation has\r\nof late years prevailed to a great extent in the public lands. The\r\nconsequence has been that large portions of them have become the property\r\nof individuals and companies, and thus the price is greatly enhanced to\r\nthose who desire to purchase for actual settlement. In order to limit the\r\narea of speculation as much as possible, the extinction of the Indian title\r\nand the extension of the public surveys ought only to keep pace with the\r\ntide of emigration.\r\n\r\nIf Congress should hereafter grant alternate sections to States or\r\ncompanies, as they have done heretofore, I recommend that the intermediate\r\nsections retained by the Government should be subject to preemption by\r\nactual settlers.\r\n\r\nIt ought ever to be our cardinal policy to reserve the public lands as much\r\nas may be for actual settlers, and this at moderate prices. We shall thus\r\nnot only best promote the prosperity of the new States and Territories and\r\nthe power of the Union, but shall secure homes for our posterity for many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe extension of our limits has brought within our jurisdiction many\r\nadditional and populous tribes of Indians, a large proportion of which are\r\nwild, untractable, and difficult to control. Predatory and warlike in their\r\ndisposition and habits, it is impossible altogether to restrain them from\r\ncommitting aggressions on each other, as well as upon our frontier citizens\r\nand those emigrating to our distant States and Territories. Hence expensive\r\nmilitary expeditions are frequently necessary to overawe and chastise the\r\nmore lawless and hostile. The present system of making them valuable\r\npresents to influence them to remain at peace has proved ineffectual. It is\r\nbelieved to be the better policy to colonize them in suitable localities\r\nwhere they can receive the rudiments of education and be gradually induced\r\nto adopt habits of industry. So far as the experiment has been tried it has\r\nworked well in practice, and it will doubtless prove to be less expensive\r\nthan the present system.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of Indians within our territorial limits is believed to\r\nbe, from the best data in the Interior Department, about 325,000. The\r\ntribes of Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks settled in the\r\nTerritory set apart for them west of Arkansas are rapidly advancing in\r\neducation and in all the arts of civilization and self-government and we\r\nmay indulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very distant day they\r\nwill be incorporated into the Union as one of the sovereign States.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the report of the Postmaster-General that the\r\nPost-Office Department still continues to depend on the Treasury, as it has\r\nbeen compelled to do for several years past, for an important portion of\r\nthe means of sustaining and extending its operations. Their rapid growth\r\nand expansion are shown by a decennial statement of the number of\r\npost-offices and the length of post-roads, commencing with the year 1827.\r\nIn that year there were 7,000 post-offices; in 1837, 11,177; in 1847,\r\n15,146, and in 1857 they number 26,586. In this year 1,725 post-offices\r\nhave been established and 704 discontinued, leaving a net increase of\r\n1,021. The postmasters of 368 offices are appointed by the President.\r\n\r\nThe length of post-roads in 1827 was 105,336 miles; in 1837,141,242 miles;\r\nin 1847, 153,818 miles, and in the year 1857 there are 242,601 miles of\r\npost-road, including 22,530 miles of railroad on which the mails are\r\ntransported.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Department for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\r\nJune, 1857, as adjusted by the Auditor, amounted to $11,507,670. To defray\r\nthese expenditures there was to the credit of the Department on the 1st\r\nJuly, 1856, the sum of $789,599; the gross revenue of the year, including\r\nthe annual allowances for the transportation of free mail matter, produced\r\n$8,053,951, and the remainder was supplied by the appropriation from the\r\nTreasury of $2,250,000 granted by the act of Congress approved August 18,\r\n1856, and by the appropriation of $666,883 made by the act of March 3,\r\n1857, leaving $252,763 to be carried to the credit of the Department in the\r\naccounts of the current year. I commend to your consideration the report of\r\nthe Department in relation to the establishment of the overland mail route\r\nfrom the Mississippi River to San Francisco, Cal. The route was selected\r\nwith my full concurrence, as the one, in my judgment, best calculated to\r\nattain the important objects contemplated by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe late disastrous monetary revulsion may have one good effect should it\r\ncause both the Government and the people to return to the practice of a\r\nwise and judicious economy both in public and private expenditures.\r\n\r\nAn overflowing Treasury has led to habits of prodigality and extravagance\r\nin our legislation. It has induced Congress to make large appropriations to\r\nobjects for which they never would have provided had it been necessary to\r\nraise the amount of revenue required to meet them by increased taxation or\r\nby loans. We are now compelled to pause in our career and to scrutinize our\r\nexpenditures with the utmost vigilance; and in performing this duty I\r\npledge my cooperation to the extent of my constitutional competency.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be observed at the same time that true public economy does not\r\nconsist in withholding the means necessary to accomplish important national\r\nobjects intrusted to us by the Constitution, and especially such as may be\r\nnecessary for the common defense. In the present crisis of the country it\r\nis our duty to confine our appropriations to objects of this character,\r\nunless in cases where justice to individuals may demand a different course.\r\nIn all cases care ought to be taken that the money granted by Congress\r\nshall be faithfully and economically applied.\r\n\r\nUnder the Federal Constitution \"every bill which shall have passed the\r\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate shall, before it become a law,\" be\r\napproved and signed by the President; and if not approved, \"he shall return\r\nit with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated.\" In\r\norder to perform this high and responsible duty, sufficient time must be\r\nallowed the President to read and examine every bill presented to him for\r\napproval. Unless this be afforded, the Constitution becomes a dead letter\r\nin this particular, and; even worse, it becomes a means of deception. Our\r\nconstituents, seeing the President's approval and signature attached to\r\neach act of Congress, are induced to believe that he has actually performed\r\nhis duty, when in truth nothing is in many cases more unfounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the practice of Congress such an examination of each bill as the\r\nConstitution requires has been rendered impossible. The most important\r\nbusiness of each session is generally crowded into its last hours, and the\r\nalternative presented to the President is either to violate the\r\nconstitutional duty which he owes to the people and approve bills which for\r\nwant of time it is impossible he should have examined, or by his refusal to\r\ndo this subject the country and individuals to great loss and\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nBesides, a practice has grown up of late years to legislate in\r\nappropriation bills at the last hours of the session on new and important\r\nsubjects. This practice constrains the President either to suffer measures\r\nto become laws which he does not approve or to incur the risk of stopping\r\nthe wheels of the Government by vetoing an appropriation bill. Formerly\r\nsuch bills were confined to specific appropriations for carrying into\r\neffect existing laws and the well-established policy of the country, and\r\nlittle time was then requited by the President for their examination.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have deliberately determined that I shall approve no\r\nbills which I have not examined, and it will be a case of extreme and most\r\nurgent necessity which shall ever induce me to depart from this rule. I\r\ntherefore respectfully but earnestly recommend that the two Houses would\r\nallow the President at least two days previous to the adjournment of each\r\nsession within which no new bill shall be presented to him for approval.\r\nUnder the existing joint rule one day is allowed, but this rule has been\r\nhitherto so constantly suspended in practice that important bills continue\r\nto be presented to him up till the very last moments of the session. In a\r\nlarge majority of cases no great public inconvenience can arise from the\r\nwant of time to examine their provisions, because the Constitution has\r\ndeclared that if a bill be presented to the President within the last ten\r\ndays of the session he is not required to return it, either with an\r\napproval or with a veto, \"in which case it shall not be a law.\" It may then\r\nlie over and be taken up and passed at the next session. Great\r\ninconvenience would only be experienced in regard to appropriation bills,\r\nbut, fortunately, under the late excellent law allowing a salary instead of\r\na per diem to members of Congress the expense and inconvenience of a called\r\nsession will be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude without commending to your favorable consideration the\r\ninterest of the people of this District. Without a representative on the\r\nfloor of Congress, they have for this very reason peculiar claims upon our\r\njust regard. To this I know, from my long acquaintance with them, they are\r\neminently entitled.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Buchanan\r\nDecember 6, 1858\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the condition of the country at the present day with what\r\nit was one year ago at the meeting of Congress, we have much reason for\r\ngratitude to that Almighty Providence which has never failed to interpose\r\nfor our relief at the most critical periods of our history. One year ago\r\nthe sectional strife between the North and the South on the dangerous\r\nsubject of slavery had again become so intense as to threaten the peace and\r\nperpetuity of the Confederacy. The application for the admission of Kansas\r\nas a State into the Union fostered this unhappy agitation and brought the\r\nwhole subject once more before Congress. It was the desire of every patriot\r\nthat such measures of legislation might be adopted as would remove the\r\nexcitement from the States and confine it to the Territory where it\r\nlegitimately belonged. Much has been done, I am happy to say, toward the\r\naccomplishment of this object during the last session of Congress. The\r\nSupreme Court of the United States had previously decided that all American\r\ncitizens have an equal right to take into the Territories whatever is held\r\nas property under the laws of any of the States, and to hold such property\r\nthere under the guardianship of the Federal Constitution so long as the\r\nTerritorial condition shall remain.\r\n\r\nThis is now a well-established position, and the proceedings of the last\r\nsession were alone wanting to give it practical effect. The principle has\r\nbeen recognized in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both\r\nHouses of Congress that a Territory has a right to come into the Union\r\neither as a free or a slave State, according to the will of a majority of\r\nits people. The just equality of all the States has thus been vindicated\r\nand a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among them has been removed.\r\n\r\nWhilst such has been the beneficial tendency of your legislative\r\nproceedings outside of Kansas, their influence has nowhere been so happy as\r\nwithin that Territory itself. Left to manage and control its own affairs in\r\nits own way, without the pressure of external influence, the revolutionary\r\nTopeka organization and all resistance to the Territorial government\r\nestablished by Congress have been finally abandoned. As a natural\r\nconsequence that fine Territory now appears to be tranquil and prosperous\r\nand is attracting increasing thousands of immigrants to make it their happy\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe past unfortunate experience of Kansas has enforced the lesson, so often\r\nalready taught, that resistance to lawful authority under our form of\r\ngovernment can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to its authors. Had\r\nthe people of the Territory yielded obedience to the laws enacted by their\r\nlegislature, it would at the present moment have contained a large\r\nadditional population of industrious and enterprising citizens, who have\r\nbeen deterred from entering its borders by the existence of civil strife\r\nand organized rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt was the resistance to rightful authority and the persevering attempts to\r\nestablish a revolutionary government under the Topeka constitution which\r\ncaused the people of Kansas to commit the grave error of refusing to vote\r\nfor delegates to the convention to frame a constitution under a law not\r\ndenied to be fair and just in its provisions. This refusal to vote has been\r\nthe prolific source of all the evils which have followed, In their\r\nhostility to the Territorial government they disregarded the principle,\r\nabsolutely essential to the working of our form of government, that a\r\nmajority of those who vote, not the majority who may remain at home, from\r\nwhatever cause, must decide the result of an election. For this reason,\r\nseeking to take advantage of their own error, they denied the authority of\r\nthe convention thus elected to frame a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe convention, notwithstanding, proceeded to adopt a constitution\r\nunexceptionable in its general features, and providing for the submission\r\nof the slavery question to a vote of the people, which, in my opinion, they\r\nwere bound to do under the Kansas and Nebraska act. This was the\r\nall-important question which had alone convulsed the Territory; and yet the\r\nopponents of the lawful government, persisting in their first error,\r\nrefrained from exercising their right to vote, and preferred that slavery\r\nshould continue rather than surrender their revolutionary Topeka\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nA wiser and better spirit seemed to prevail before the first Monday of\r\nJanuary last, when an election was held under the constitution. A majority\r\nof the people then voted for a governor and other State officers, for a\r\nMember of Congress and members of the State legislature. This election was\r\nwarmly contested by the two political parties in Kansas, and a greater vote\r\nwas polled than at any previous election. A large majority of the members\r\nof the legislature elect belonged to that party which had previously\r\nrefused to vote. The antislavery party were thus placed in the ascendant,\r\nand the political power of the State was in their own hands. Had Congress\r\nadmitted Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton constitution, the\r\nlegislature might at its very first session have submitted the question to\r\na vote of the people whether they would or would not have a convention to\r\namend their constitution, either on the slavery or any other question, and\r\nhave adopted all necessary means for giving speedy effect to the will of\r\nthe majority. Thus the Kansas question would have been immediately and\r\nfinally settled.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I submitted to Congress the constitution thus\r\nframed, with all the officers already elected necessary to put the State\r\ngovernment into operation, accompanied by a strong recommendation in favor\r\nof the admission of Kansas as a State. In the course of my long public life\r\nI have never performed any official act which in the retrospect has\r\nafforded me more heartfelt satisfaction. Its admission could have inflicted\r\nno possible injury on any human being, whilst it would within a brief\r\nperiod have restored peace to Kansas and harmony to the Union. In that\r\nevent the slavery question would ere this have been finally settled\r\naccording to the legally expressed will of a majority of the voters, and\r\npopular sovereignty would thus have been vindicated in a constitutional\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWith my deep convictions of duty I could have pursued no other course. It\r\nis true that as an individual I had expressed an opinion, both before and\r\nduring the session of the convention, in favor of submitting the remaining\r\nclauses of the constitution, as well as that concerning slavery, to the\r\npeople. But, acting in an official character, neither myself nor any human\r\nauthority had the power to rejudge the proceedings of the convention and\r\ndeclare the constitution which it had framed to be a nullity. To have done\r\nthis would have been a violation of the Kansas and Nebraska act, which left\r\nthe people of the Territory \"perfectly free to form and regulate their\r\ndomestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\" It would equally have violated the great principle of\r\npopular sovereignty, at the foundation of our institutions, to deprive the\r\npeople of the power, if they thought proper to exercise it, of confiding to\r\ndelegates elected by themselves the trust of framing a constitution without\r\nrequiring them to subject their constituents to the trouble, expense, and\r\ndelay of a second election. It would have been in opposition to many\r\nprecedents in our history, commencing in the very best age of the Republic,\r\nof the admission of Territories as States into the Union without a previous\r\nvote of the people approving their constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is to be lamented that a question so insignificant when viewed in its\r\npractical effects on the people of Kansas, whether decided one way or the\r\nother, should have kindled such a flame of excitement throughout the\r\ncountry. This reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of warning\r\nfor our future guidance. Practically considered, the question is simply\r\nwhether the people of that Territory should first come into the Union and\r\nthen change any provision in their constitution not agreeable to\r\nthemselves, or accomplish the very same object by remaining out of the\r\nUnion and framing another constitution in accordance with their will. In\r\neither case the result would be precisely the same. The only difference, in\r\npoint of fact, is that the object would have been much sooner attained and\r\nthe pacification of Kansas more speedily effected had it been admitted as a\r\nState during the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation, however, for the immediate admission of Kansas failed to\r\nmeet the approbation of Congress. They deemed it wiser to adopt a different\r\nmeasure for the settlement of the question. For my own part, I should have\r\nbeen willing to yield my assent to almost any constitutional measure to\r\naccomplish this object. I therefore cordially acquiesced in what has been\r\ncalled the English compromise and approved the \"act for the admission of\r\nthe State of Kansas into the Union\" upon the terms therein prescribed.\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinance which accompanied the Lecompton constitution the people\r\nof Kansas had claimed double the quantity of public lands for the support\r\nof common schools which had ever been previously granted to any State upon\r\nentering the Union, and also the alternate sections of land for 12 miles on\r\neach side of two railroads proposed to be constructed from the northern to\r\nthe southern boundary and from the eastern to the western boundary of the\r\nState. Congress, deeming these claims unreasonable, provided by the act of\r\nMay 4, 1858, to which I have just referred, for the admission of the State\r\non an equal footing with the original States, but \"upon the fundamental\r\ncondition precedent\" that a majority of the people thereof, at an election\r\nto be held for that purpose, should, in place of the very large grants of\r\npublic lands which they had demanded under the ordinance, accept such\r\ngrants as had been made to Minnesota and other new States. Under this act,\r\nshould a majority reject the proposition offered them, \"it shall be deemed\r\nand held that the people of Kansas do not desire admission into the Union\r\nwith said constitution under the conditions set forth in said proposition.\"\r\nIn that event the act authorizes the people of the Territory to elect\r\ndelegates to form a constitution and State government for themselves\r\n\"whenever, and not before, it is ascertained by a census, duly and legally\r\ntaken, that the population of said Territory equals or exceeds the ratio of\r\nrepresentation required for a member of the House of Representatives of the\r\nCongress of the United States.\" The delegates thus assembled \"shall first\r\ndetermine by a vote whether it is the wish of the people of the proposed\r\nState to be admitted into the Union at that time, and, if so, shall proceed\r\nto form a constitution and take all necessary steps for the establishment\r\nof a State government in conformity with the Federal Constitution.\" After\r\nthis constitution shall have been formed, Congress, carrying out the\r\nprinciples of popular sovereignty and nonintervention, have left \"the mode\r\nand manner of its approval or ratification by the people of the proposed\r\nState\" to be \"prescribed by law,\" and they \"shall then be admitted into the\r\nUnion as a State under such constitution, thus fairly and legally made,\r\nwith or without slavery, as said constitution may prescribe.\"\r\n\r\nAn election was held throughout Kansas, in pursuance of the provisions of\r\nthis act, on the 2d day of August last, and it resulted in the rejection by\r\na large majority of the proposition submitted to the people by Congress.\r\nThis being the case, they are now authorized to form another constitution,\r\npreparatory to admission into the Union, but not until their number, as\r\nascertained by a census, shall equal or exceed the ratio required to elect\r\na member to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, in the present state of the case, that a third\r\nconstitution can be lawfully framed and presented to Congress by Kansas\r\nbefore its population shall have reached the designated number. Nor is it\r\nto be presumed that after their sad experience in resisting the Territorial\r\nlaws they will attempt to adopt a constitution in express violation of the\r\nprovisions of an act of Congress. During the session of 1856 much of the\r\ntime of Congress was occupied on the question of admitting Kansas under the\r\nTopeka constitution. Again, nearly the whole of the last session was\r\ndevoted to the question of its admission under the Lecompton constitution.\r\nSurely it is not unreasonable to require the people of Kansas to wait\r\nbefore making a third attempt until the number of their inhabitants shall\r\namount to 93,420. During this brief period the harmony of the States as\r\nwell as the great business interests of the country demand that the people\r\nof the Union shall not for a third time be convulsed by another agitation\r\non the Kansas question. By waiting for a short time and acting in obedience\r\nto law Kansas will glide into the Union without the slightest impediment.\r\n\r\nThis excellent provision, which Congress have applied to Kansas, ought to\r\nbe extended and rendered applicable to all Territories which may hereafter\r\nseek admission into the Union.\r\n\r\nWhilst Congress possess the undoubted power of admitting a new State into\r\nthe Union, however small may be the number of its inhabitants, yet this\r\npower ought not, in my opinion, to be exercised before the population shall\r\namount to the ratio required by the act for the admission of Kansas. Had\r\nthis been previously the rule, the country would have escaped all the evils\r\nand misfortunes to which it has been exposed by the Kansas question.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective application,\r\nand exclude a State which, acting upon the past practice of the Government,\r\nhas already formed its constitution, elected its legislature and other\r\nofficers, and is now prepared to enter the Union. The rule ought to be\r\nadopted, whether we consider its bearing on the people of the Territories\r\nor upon the people of the existing States. Many of the serious dissentions\r\nwhich have prevailed in Congress and throughout the country would have been\r\navoided had this rule been established at an earlier period of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the formation of a new Territory people from different\r\nStates and from foreign countries rush into it for the laudable purpose of\r\nimproving their condition. Their first duty to themselves is to open and\r\ncultivate farms, to construct roads, to establish schools, to erect places\r\nof religious worship, and to devote their energies generally to reclaim the\r\nwilderness and to lay the foundations of a flourishing and prosperous\r\ncommonwealth. If in this incipient condition, with a population of a few\r\nthousand, they should prematurely enter the Union, they are oppressed by\r\nthe burden of State taxation, and the means necessary for the improvement\r\nof the Territory and the advancement of their own interests are thus\r\ndiverted to very different purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government has ever been a liberal parent to the Territories\r\nand a generous contributor to the useful enterprises of the early settlers.\r\nIt has paid the expenses of their governments and legislative assemblies\r\nout of the common Treasury, and thus relieved them from a heavy charge.\r\nUnder these circumstances nothing can be better calculated to retard their\r\nmaterial progress than to divert them from their useful employments by\r\nprematurely exciting angry political contests among themselves for the\r\nbenefit of aspiring leaders. It is surely no hardship for embryo governors,\r\nSenators, and Members of Congress to wait until the number of inhabitants\r\nshall equal those of a single Congressional district. They surely ought not\r\nto be permitted to rush into the Union with a population less than one-half\r\nof several of the large counties in the interior of some of the States.\r\nThis was the condition of Kansas when it made application to be admitted\r\nunder the Topeka constitution. Besides, it requires some time to render the\r\nmass of a population collected in a new Territory at all homogeneous and to\r\nunite them on anything like a fixed policy. Establish the rule, and all\r\nwill look forward to it and govern themselves accordingly. But justice to\r\nthe people of the several States requires that this rule should be\r\nestablished by Congress. Each State is entitled to two Senators and at\r\nleast one Representative in Congress. Should the people of the States fail\r\nto elect a Vice-President, the power devolves upon the Senate to select\r\nthis officer from the two highest candidates on the list. In case of the\r\ndeath of the President, the Vice-President thus elected by the Senate\r\nbecomes President of the United States. On all questions of legislation the\r\nSenators from the smallest States of the Union have an equal vote with\r\nthose from the largest. The same may be said in regard to the ratification\r\nof treaties and of Executive appointments. All this has worked admirably in\r\npractice, whilst it conforms in principle with the character of a\r\nGovernment instituted by sovereign States. I presume no American citizen\r\nwould desire the slightest change in the arrangement. Still, is it not\r\nunjust and unequal to the existing States to invest some 40,000 or 50,000\r\npeople collected in a Territory with the attributes of sovereignty and\r\nplace them on an equal footing with Virginia and New York in the Senate of\r\nthe United States?\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I earnestly recommend the passage of a general act which\r\nshall provide that, upon the application of a Territorial legislature\r\ndeclaring their belief that the Territory contains a number of inhabitants\r\nwhich, if in a State, would entitle them to elect a Member of Congress, it\r\nshall be the duty of the President to cause a census of the inhabitants to\r\nbe taken, and if found sufficient then by the terms of this act to\r\nauthorize them to proceed \"in their own way\" to frame a State constitution\r\npreparatory to admission into the Union. I also recommend that an\r\nappropriation may be made to enable the President to take a census of the\r\npeople of Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Territory of Utah, when contrasted with what\r\nit was one year ago, is a subject for congratulation. It was then in a\r\nstate of open rebellion, and, cost what it might, the character of the\r\nGovernment required that this rebellion should be suppressed and the\r\nMormons compelled to yield obedience to the Constitution and the laws. In\r\norder to accomplish this object, as I informed you in my last annual\r\nmessage, I appointed a new governor instead of Brigham Young, and other\r\nFederal officers to take the place of those who, consulting their personal\r\nsafety, had found it necessary to withdraw from the Territory.\r\n\r\nTo protect these civil officers, and to aid them, as a posse comitatus, in\r\nthe execution of the laws in case of need, I ordered a detachment of the\r\nArmy to accompany them to Utah. The necessity for adopting these measures\r\nis now demonstrated.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, 1857, Governor Young issued his proclamation, in\r\nthe style of an independent sovereign, announcing his purpose to resist by\r\nforce of arms the entry of the United States troops into our own Territory\r\nof Utah. By this he required all the forces in the Territory to \"hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all\r\nsuch invasion,\" and established martial law from its date throughout the\r\nTerritory. These proved to be no idle threats. Forts Bridger and Supply\r\nwere vacated and burnt down by the Mormons to deprive our troops of a\r\nshelter after their long and fatiguing march. Orders were issued by Daniel\r\nH. Wells, styling himself \"Lieutenant General, Nauvoo Legion,\" to stampede\r\nthe animals of the United States troops on their march, to set fire to\r\ntheir trains, to burn the grass and the whole country before them and on\r\ntheir flanks, to keep them from sleeping by night surprises, and to\r\nblockade the road by felling trees and destroying the fords of rivers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThese orders were promptly and effectually obeyed. On the 4th of October,\r\n1857, the Mormons captured and burned, on Green River, three of our supply\r\ntrains, consisting of seventy-five wagons loaded with provisions and tents\r\nfor the army, and carried away several hundred animals. This diminished the\r\nsupply of provisions so materially that General Johnston was obliged to\r\nreduce the ration, and even with this precaution there was only sufficient\r\nleft to subsist the troops until the 1st of June.\r\n\r\nOur little army behaved admirably in their encampment at Fort Bridger under\r\nthese trying privations. In the midst of the mountains, in a dreary,\r\nunsettled, and inhospitable region, more than a thousand miles from home,\r\nthey passed the severe and inclement winter without a murmur. They looked\r\nforward with confidence for relief from their country in due season, and in\r\nthis they were not disappointed. The Secretary of War employed all his\r\nenergies to forward them the necessary supplies and to muster and send such\r\na military force to Utah as would render resistance on the part of the\r\nMormons hopeless, and thus terminate the war without the effusion of blood.\r\nIn his efforts he was efficiently sustained by Congress. They granted\r\nappropriations sufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily created,\r\nand also provided for raising two regiments of volunteers \"for the purpose\r\nof quelling disturbances in the Territory of Utah, for the protection of\r\nsupply and emigrant trains, and the suppression of Indian hostilities on\r\nthe frontiers.\" Happily, there was no occasion to call these regiments into\r\nservice. If there had been, I should have felt serious embarrassment in\r\nselecting them, so great was the number of our brave and patriotic citizens\r\nanxious to serve their country in this distant and apparently dangerous\r\nexpedition. Thus it has ever been, and thus may it ever be.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom and economy of sending sufficient reenforcements to Utah are\r\nestablished, not only by the event, but in the opinion of those who from\r\ntheir position and opportunities are the most capable of forming a correct\r\njudgment. General Johnston, the commander of the forces, in addressing the\r\nSecretary of War from Fort Bridger under date of October 18, 1857,\r\nexpresses the opinion that \"unless a large force is sent here, from the\r\nnature of the country a protracted war on their [the Mormons's] part is\r\ninevitable.\" This he considered necessary to terminate the war \"speedily\r\nand more economically than if attempted by insufficient means.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was my anxious desire that the Mormons should yield\r\nobedience to the Constitution and the laws without rendering it necessary\r\nto resort to military force. To aid in accomplishing this object, I deemed\r\nit advisable in April last to dispatch two distinguished citizens of the\r\nUnited States, Messrs. Powell and McCulloch, to Utah. They bore with them a\r\nproclamation addressed by myself to the inhabitants of Utah, dated on the\r\n6th day of that month, warning them of their true condition and how\r\nhopeless it was on their part to persist in rebellion against the United\r\nStates, and offering all those who should submit to the laws a full pardon\r\nfor their past seditions and treasons. At the same time I assured those who\r\nshould persist in rebellion against the United States that they must expect\r\nno further lenity, but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their\r\ndeserts. The instructions to these agents, as well as a copy of the\r\nproclamation and their reports, are herewith submitted. It will be seen by\r\ntheir report of the 3d of July last that they have fully confirmed the\r\nopinion expressed by General Johnston in the previous October as to the\r\nnecessity of sending reenforcements to Utah. In this they state that they\r\n\"are firmly impressed with the belief that the presence of the Army here\r\nand the large additional force that had been ordered to this Territory were\r\nthe chief inducements that caused the Mormons to abandon the idea of\r\nresisting the authority of the United States. A less decisive policy would\r\nprobably have resulted in a long, bloody, and expensive war.\"\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen conducted themselves to my entire satisfaction and rendered\r\nuseful services in executing the humane intentions of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt also affords me great satisfaction to state that Governor Cumming has\r\nperformed his duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the happiest\r\neffect. I can not in this connection refrain from mentioning the valuable\r\nservices of Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who, from motives of pure benevolence\r\nand without any official character or pecuniary compensation, visited Utah\r\nduring the last inclement winter for the purpose of contributing to the\r\npacification of the Territory.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the governor and other civil officers of Utah\r\nare now performing their appropriate functions without resistance. The\r\nauthority of the Constitution and the laws has been fully restored and\r\npeace prevails throughout the Territory. A portion of the troops sent to\r\nUtah are now encamped in Cedar Valley, 44 miles southwest of Salt Lake\r\nCity, and the remainder have been ordered to Oregon to suppress Indian\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nThe march of the army to Salt Lake City through the Indian Territory has had\r\na powerful effect in restraining the hostile feelings against the United\r\nStates which existed among the Indians in that region and in securing\r\nemigrants to the far West against their depredations. This will also be the\r\nmeans of establishing military posts and promoting settlements along the\r\nroute. I recommend that the benefits of our land laws and preemption system\r\nbe extended to the people of Utah by the establishment of a land office in\r\nthat Territory.\r\n\r\nI have occasion also to congratulate you on the result of our negotiations\r\nwith China.\r\n\r\nYou were informed by my last annual message that our minister had been\r\ninstructed to occupy a neutral position in the hostilities conducted by\r\nGreat Britain and France against Canton. He was, however, at the same time\r\ndirected to cooperate cordially with the British and French ministers in\r\nall peaceful measures to secure by treaty those just concessions to foreign\r\ncommerce which the nations of the world had a right to demand. It was\r\nimpossible for me to proceed further than this on my own authority without\r\nusurping the war-making power, which under the Constitution belongs\r\nexclusively to Congress.\r\n\r\nBesides, after a careful examination of the nature and extent of our\r\ngrievances, I did not believe they were of such a pressing and aggravated\r\ncharacter as would have justified Congress in declaring war against the\r\nChinese Empire without first making another earnest attempt to adjust them\r\nby peaceful negotiation. I was the more inclined to this opinion because of\r\nthe severe chastisement which had then but recently been inflicted upon the\r\nChinese by our squadron in the capture and destruction of the Barrier forts\r\nto avenge an alleged insult to our flag. The event has proved the wisdom of\r\nour neutrality. Our minister has executed his instructions with eminent\r\nskill and ability. In conjunction with the Russian plenipotentiary, he has\r\npeacefully, but effectually, cooperated with the English and French\r\nplenipotentiaries, and each of the four powers has concluded a separate\r\ntreaty with China of a highly satisfactory character. The treaty concluded\r\nby our own plenipotentiary will immediately be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory efforts\r\nof our consul-general in Japan a new treaty has been concluded with that\r\nEmpire, which may be expected materially to augment our trade and\r\nintercourse in that quarter and remove from our countrymen the disabilities\r\nwhich have heretofore been imposed upon the exercise of their religion. The\r\ntreaty shall be submitted to the Senate for approval without delay.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the Government of\r\nGreat Britain should be amicably and speedily adjusted. It has been the\r\nmisfortune of both countries, almost ever since the period of the\r\nRevolution, to have been annoyed by a succession of irritating and\r\ndangerous questions, threatening their friendly relations. This has\r\npartially prevented the full development of those feelings of mutual\r\nfriendship between the people of the two countries so natural in themselves\r\nand so conducive to their common interest. Any serious interruption of the\r\ncommerce between the United States and Great Britain would be equally\r\ninjurious to both. In fact, no two nations have ever existed on the face of\r\nthe earth which could do each other so much good or so much harm.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these sentiments, I am gratified to inform you that the\r\nlong-pending controversy between the two Governments in relation to the\r\nquestion of visitation and search has been amicably adjusted. The claim on\r\nthe part of Great Britain forcibly to visit American vessels on the high\r\nseas in time of peace could not be sustained under the law of nations, and\r\nit had been overruled by her own most eminent jurists. This question was\r\nrecently brought to an issue by the repeated acts of British cruisers in\r\nboarding and searching our merchant vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nadjacent seas. These acts were the more injurious and annoying, as these\r\nwaters are traversed by a large portion of the commerce and navigation of\r\nthe United States and their free and unrestricted use is essential to the\r\nsecurity of the coastwise trade between the different States of the Union.\r\nSuch vexatious interruptions could not fail to excite the feelings of the\r\ncountry and to require the interposition of the Government. Remonstrances\r\nwere addressed to the British Government against these violations of our\r\nrights of sovereignty, and a naval force was at the same time ordered to\r\nthe Cuban waters with directions \"to protect all vessels of the United\r\nStates on the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of\r\nany other nation.\" These measures received the unqualified and even\r\nenthusiastic approbation of the American people. Most fortunately, however,\r\nno collision took place, and the British Government promptly avowed its\r\nrecognition of the principles of international law upon this subject as\r\nlaid down by the Government of the United States in the note of the\r\nSecretary of State to the British minister at Washington of April 10, 1858,\r\nwhich secure the vessels of the United States upon the high seas from\r\nvisitation or search in time of peace under any circumstances whatever. The\r\nclaim has been abandoned in a manner reflecting honor on the British\r\nGovernment and evincing a just regard for the law of nations, and can not\r\nfail to strengthen the amicable relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe British Government at the same time proposed to the United States that\r\nsome mode should be adopted, by mutual arrangement between the two\r\ncountries, of a character which may be found effective without being\r\noffensive, for verifying the nationality of vessels suspected on good\r\ngrounds of carrying false colors. They have also invited the United States\r\nto take the initiative and propose measures for this purpose. Whilst\r\ndeclining to assume so grave a responsibility, the Secretary of State has\r\ninformed the British Government that we are ready to receive any proposals\r\nwhich they may feel disposed to offer having this object in view, and to\r\nconsider them in an amicable spirit. A strong opinion is, however,\r\nexpressed that the occasional abuse of the flag of any nation is an evil\r\nfar less to be deprecated than would be the establishment of any\r\nregulations which might be incompatible with the freedom of the seas. This\r\nGovernment has yet received no communication specifying the manner in which\r\nthe British Government would propose to carry out their suggestion, and I\r\nam inclined to believe that no plan which can be devised will be free from\r\ngrave embarrassments. Still, I shall form no decided opinion on the subject\r\nuntil I shall have carefully and in the best spirit examined any proposals\r\nwhich they may think proper to make.\r\n\r\nI am truly sorry I can not also inform you that the complications between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States arising out of the Clayton and Bulwer\r\ntreaty of April, 1850, have been finally adjusted.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of your last session I had reason to hope that,\r\nemancipating themselves from further unavailing discussions, the two\r\nGovernments would proceed to settle the Central American questions in a\r\npractical manner, alike honorable and satisfactory to both; and this hope I\r\nhave not yet abandoned. In my last annual message I stated that overtures\r\nhad been made by the British Government for this purpose in a friendly\r\nspirit, which I cordially reciprocated. Their proposal was to withdraw\r\nthese questions from direct negotiation between the two Governments, but to\r\naccomplish the same object by a negotiation between the British Government\r\nand each of the Central American Republics whose territorial interests are\r\nimmediately involved. The settlement was to be made in accordance with the\r\ngeneral tenor of the interpretation placed upon the Clayton and Bulwer\r\ntreaty by the United States, with certain modifications. As negotiations\r\nare still pending upon this basis, it would not be proper for me now to\r\ncommunicate their present condition. A final settlement of these questions\r\nis greatly to be desired, as this would wipe out the last remaining subject\r\nof dispute between the two countries.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the great Empires of France and Russia, as well as with\r\nall other Governments on the continent of Europe, except that of Spain,\r\ncontinue to be of the most friendly character.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our relations remain in an unsatisfactory condition. In my\r\nmessage of December last I informed you that our envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to Madrid had asked for his recall, and it was my\r\npurpose to send out a new minister to that Court with special instructions\r\non all questions pending between the two Governments, and with a\r\ndetermination to have them speedily and amicably adjusted if that were\r\npossible. This purpose has been hitherto defeated by causes which I need\r\nnot enumerate. The mission to Spain has been intrusted to a distinguished\r\ncitizen of Kentucky, who will proceed to Madrid without delay and make\r\nanother and a final attempt to obtain justice from that Government.\r\n\r\nSpanish officials under the direct control of the Captain-General of Cuba\r\nhave insulted our national flag and in repeated instances have from time to\r\ntime inflicted injuries on the persons and property of our citizens. These\r\nhave given birth to numerous claims against the Spanish Government, the\r\nmerits of which have been ably discussed for a series of years by our\r\nsuccessive diplomatic representatives. Notwithstanding this, we have not\r\narrived at a practical result in any single instance, unless we may except\r\nthe case of the Black Warrior, under the late Administration, and that\r\npresented an outrage of such a character as would have justified an\r\nimmediate resort to war. All our attempts to obtain redress have been\r\nbaffled and defeated. The frequent and oft-recurring changes in the Spanish\r\nministry have been employed as reasons for delay. We have been compelled to\r\nwait again and again until the new minister shall have had time to\r\ninvestigate the justice of our demands.\r\n\r\nEven what have been denominated \"the Cuban claims,\" in which more than 100\r\nof our citizens are directly interested, have furnished no exception. These\r\nclaims were for the refunding of duties unjustly exacted from American\r\nvessels at different custom-houses in Cuba so long ago as the year 1844.\r\nThe principles upon which they rest are so manifestly equitable and just\r\nthat, after a period of nearly ten years, in 1854 they were recognized by\r\nthe Spanish Government. Proceedings were afterwards instituted to ascertain\r\ntheir amount, and this was finally fixed, according to their own statement\r\n(with which we were satisfied), at the sum of $128,635.54. Just at the\r\nmoment, after a delay of fourteen years, when we had reason to expect that\r\nthis sum would be repaid with interest, we have received a proposal\r\noffering to refund one-third of that amount ($42,878.41), but without\r\ninterest, if we would accept this in full satisfaction. The offer is also\r\naccompanied by a declaration that this indemnification is not founded on\r\nany reason of strict justice, but is made as a special favor.\r\n\r\nOne alleged cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment of\r\nour claims arises from an obstacle which it is the duty of the Spanish\r\nGovernment to remove. Whilst the Captain-General of Cuba is invested with\r\ngeneral despotic authority in the government of that island, the power is\r\nwithheld from him to examine and redress wrongs committed by officials\r\nunder his control on citizens of the United States. Instead of making our\r\ncomplaints directly to him at Havana, we are obliged to present them\r\nthrough our minister at Madrid. These are then referred back to the\r\nCaptain-General for information, and much time is thus consumed in\r\npreliminary investigations and correspondence between Madrid and Cuba\r\nbefore the Spanish Government will consent to proceed to negotiation. Many\r\nof the difficulties between the two Governments would be obviated and a\r\nlong train of negotiation avoided if the Captain-General were invested with\r\nauthority to settle questions of easy solution on the spot, where all the\r\nfacts are fresh and could be promptly and satisfactorily ascertained. We\r\nhave hitherto in vain urged upon the Spanish Government to confer this\r\npower upon the Captain-General, and our minister to Spain will again be\r\ninstructed to urge this subject on their notice. In this respect we occupy\r\na different position from the powers of Europe. Cuba is almost within sight\r\nof our shores; our commerce with it is far greater than that of any other\r\nnation, including Spain itself, and our citizens are in habits of daily and\r\nextended personal intercourse with every part of the island. It is\r\ntherefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occurs, no matter how\r\nunimportant, which might be readily settled at the moment, we should be\r\nobliged to resort to Madrid, especially when the very first step to be\r\ntaken there is to refer it back to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Cuba, in its existing colonial condition, is a constant\r\nsource of injury and annoyance to the American people. It is the only spot\r\nin the civilized world where the African slave trade is tolerated, and we\r\nare bound by treaty with Great Britain to maintain a naval force on the\r\ncoast of Africa, at much expense both of life and treasure, solely for the\r\npurpose of arresting slavers bound to that island. The late serious\r\ndifficulties between the United States and Great Britain respecting the\r\nright of search, now so happily terminated, could never have arisen if Cuba\r\nhad not afforded a market for slaves. As long as this market shall remain\r\nopen there can be no hope for the civilization of benighted Africa. Whilst\r\nthe demand for slaves continues in Cuba wars will be waged among the petty\r\nand barbarous chiefs in Africa for the purpose of seizing subjects to\r\nsupply this trade. In such a condition of affairs it is impossible that the\r\nlight of civilization and religion can ever penetrate these dark abodes.\r\n\r\nIt has been made known to the world by my predecessors that the United\r\nStates have on several occasions endeavored to acquire Cuba from Spain by\r\nhonorable negotiation. If this were accomplished, the last relic of the\r\nAfrican slave trade would instantly disappear. We would not, if we could,\r\nacquire Cuba in any other manner. This is due to our national character.\r\nAll the territory which we have acquired since the origin of the Government\r\nhas been by fair purchase from France, Spain, and Mexico or by the free and\r\nvoluntary act of the independent State of Texas in blending her destinies\r\nwith our own. This course we shall ever pursue, unless circumstances should\r\noccur which we do not now anticipate, rendering a departure from it clearly\r\njustifiable under the imperative and overruling law of self-preservation.\r\nThe island of Cuba, from its geographical position, commands the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi and the immense and annually increasing trade, foreign and\r\ncoastwise, from the valley of that noble river, now embracing half the\r\nsovereign States of the Union. With that island under the dominion of a\r\ndistant foreign power this trade, of vital importance to these States, is\r\nexposed to the danger of being destroyed in time of war, and it has\r\nhitherto been subjected to perpetual injury and annoyance in time of peace.\r\nOur relations with Spain, which ought to be of the most friendly character,\r\nmust always be placed in jeopardy whilst the existing colonial government\r\nover the island shall remain in its present condition.\r\n\r\nWhilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the\r\nUnited States, its value to Spain is comparatively unimportant. Such was\r\nthe relative situation of the parties when the great Napoleon transferred\r\nLouisiana to the United States. Jealous as he ever was of the national\r\nhonor and interests of France, no person throughout the world has imputed\r\nblame to him for accepting a pecuniary equivalent for this cession.\r\n\r\nThe publicity which has been given to our former negotiations upon this\r\nsubject and the large appropriation which may be required to effect the\r\npurpose render it expedient before making another attempt to renew the\r\nnegotiation that I should lay the whole subject before Congress. This is\r\nespecially necessary, as it may become indispensable to success that I\r\nshould be intrusted with the means of making an advance to the Spanish\r\nGovernment immediately after the signing of the treaty, without awaiting\r\nthe ratification of it by the Senate. I am encouraged to make this\r\nsuggestion by the example of Mr. Jefferson previous to the purchase of\r\nLouisiana from France and by that of Mr. Polk in view of the acquisition of\r\nterritory from Mexico. I refer the whole subject to Congress and commend it\r\nto their careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation made in my message of December last in favor of\r\nan appropriation \"to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of\r\ndistribution among the claimants in the Amistad case.\" President Polk first\r\nmade a similar recommendation in December, 1847, and it was repeated by my\r\nimmediate predecessor in December, 1853. I entertain no doubt that\r\nindemnity is fairly due to these claimants under our treaty with Spain of\r\nOctober 27, 1795; and whilst demanding justice we ought to do justice. An\r\nappropriation promptly made for this purpose could not fail to exert a\r\nfavorable influence on our negotiations with Spain.\r\n\r\nOur position in relation to the independent States south of us on this\r\ncontinent, and especially those within the limits of North America, is of a\r\npeculiar character. The northern boundary of Mexico is coincident with our\r\nown southern boundary from ocean to ocean, and we must necessarily feel a\r\ndeep interest in all that concerns the well-being and the fate of so near a\r\nneighbor. We have always cherished the kindest wishes for the success of\r\nthat Republic, and have indulged the hope that it might at last, after all\r\nits trials, enjoy peace and prosperity under a free and stable government.\r\nWe have never hitherto interfered, directly or indirectly, with its\r\ninternal affairs, and it is a duty which we owe to ourselves to protect the\r\nintegrity of its territory against the hostile interference of any other\r\npower. Our geographical position, our direct interest in all that concerns\r\nMexico, and our well-settled policy in regard to the North American\r\ncontinent render this an indispensable duty.\r\n\r\nMexico has been in a state of constant revolution almost ever since it\r\nachieved its independence. One military leader after another has usurped\r\nthe Government in rapid succession, and the various constitutions from time\r\nto time adopted have been set at naught almost as soon as they were\r\nproclaimed. The successive Governments have afforded no adequate\r\nprotection, either to Mexican citizens or foreign residents, against\r\nlawless violence. Heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military\r\nchieftain has been generally followed by at least the nominal submission of\r\nthe country to his rule for a brief period, but not so at the present\r\ncrisis of Mexican affairs. A civil war has been raging for some time\r\nthroughout the Republic between the central Government at the City of\r\nMexico, which has endeavored to subvert the constitution last framed by\r\nmilitary power, and those who maintain the authority of that constitution.\r\nThe antagonist parties each hold possession of different States of the\r\nRepublic, and the fortunes of the war are constantly changing. Meanwhile\r\nthe most reprehensible means have been employed by both parties to extort\r\nmoney from foreigners, as well as natives, to carry on this ruinous\r\ncontest. The truth is that this fine country, blessed with a productive\r\nsoil and a benign climate, has been reduced by civil dissension to a\r\ncondition of almost hopeless anarchy and imbecility. It would be vain for\r\nthis Government to attempt to enforce payment in money of the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens, now amounting to more than $10,000,000, against Mexico,\r\nbecause she is destitute of all pecuniary means to satisfy these demands.\r\n\r\nOur late minister was furnished with ample powers and instructions for the\r\nadjustment of all pending questions with the central Government of Mexico,\r\nand he performed his duty with zeal and ability. The claims of our\r\ncitizens, some of them arising out of the violation of an express provision\r\nof the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and others from gross injuries to\r\npersons as well as property, have remained unredressed and even unnoticed.\r\nRemonstrances against these grievances have been addressed without effect\r\nto that Government. Meantime in various parts of the Republic instances\r\nhave been numerous of the murder, imprisonment, and plunder of our citizens\r\nby different parties claiming and exercising a local jurisdiction; but the\r\ncentral Government, although repeatedly urged thereto, have made no effort\r\neither to punish the authors of these outrages or to prevent their\r\nrecurrence. No American citizen can now visit Mexico on lawful business\r\nwithout imminent danger to his person and property. There is no adequate\r\nprotection to either, and in this respect our treaty with that Republic is\r\nalmost a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs was brought to a crisis in May last by the\r\npromulgation of a decree levying a contribution pro rata upon all the\r\ncapital in the Republic between certain specified amounts, whether held by\r\nMexicans or foreigners. Mr. Forsyth, regarding this decree in the light of\r\na \"forced loan,\" formally protested against its application to his\r\ncountrymen and advised them not to pay the contribution, but to suffer it\r\nto be forcibly exacted. Acting upon this advice, an American citizen\r\nrefused to pay the contribution, and his property was seized by armed men\r\nto satisfy the amount. Not content with this, the Government proceeded\r\nstill further and issued a decree banishing him from the country. Our\r\nminister immediately notified them that if this decree should be carried\r\ninto execution he would feel it to be his duty to adopt \"the most decided\r\nmeasures that belong to the powers and obligations of the representative\r\noffice.\" Notwithstanding this warning, the banishment was enforced, and Mr.\r\nForsyth promptly announced to the Government the suspension of the\r\npolitical relations of his legation with them until the pleasure of his own\r\nGovernment should be ascertained.\r\n\r\nThis Government did not regard the contribution imposed by the decree of\r\nthe 15th May last to be in strictness a \"forced loan,\" and as such\r\nprohibited by the tenth article of the treaty of 1826 between Great Britain\r\nand Mexico, to the benefits of which American citizens are entitled by\r\ntreaty; yet the imposition of the contribution upon foreigners was\r\nconsidered an unjust and oppressive measure. Besides, internal factions in\r\nother parts of the Republic were at the same time levying similar exactions\r\nupon the property of our citizens and interrupting their commerce. There\r\nhad been an entire failure on the part of our minister to secure redress\r\nfor the wrongs which our citizens had endured, notwithstanding his\r\npersevering efforts. And from the temper manifested by the Mexican\r\nGovernment he had repeatedly assured us that no favorable change could be\r\nexpected until the United States should \"give striking evidence of their\r\nwill and power to protect their citizens,\" and that \"severe chastening is\r\nthe only earthly remedy for our grievances.\" From this statement of facts\r\nit would have been worse than idle to direct Mr. Forsyth to retrace his\r\nsteps and resume diplomatic relations with that Government, and it was\r\ntherefore deemed proper to sanction his withdrawal of the legation from the\r\nCity of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAbundant cause now undoubtedly exists for a resort to hostilities against\r\nthe Government still holding possession of the capital. Should they succeed\r\nin subduing the constitutional forces, all reasonable hope will then have\r\nexpired of a peaceful settlement of our difficulties. On the other hand,\r\nshould the constitutional party prevail and their authority be established\r\nover the Republic, there is reason to hope that they will be animated by a\r\nless unfriendly spirit and may grant that redress to American citizens\r\nwhich justice requires so far as they may possess the means. But for this\r\nexpectation I should at once have recommended to Congress to grant the\r\nnecessary power to the President to take possession of a sufficient portion\r\nof the remote and unsettled territory of Mexico, to be held in pledge until\r\nour injuries shall be redressed and our just demands be satisfied. We have\r\nalready exhausted every milder means of obtaining justice. In such a case\r\nthis remedy of reprisals is recognized by the law of nations, not only as\r\njust in itself, but as a means of preventing actual war.\r\n\r\nBut there is another view of our relations with Mexico, arising from the\r\nunhappy condition of affairs along our southwestern frontier, which demands\r\nimmediate action. In that remote region, where there are but few white\r\ninhabitants, large bands of hostile and predatory Indians roam\r\npromiscuously over the Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora and our\r\nadjoining Territories. The local governments of these States are perfectly\r\nhelpless and are kept in a state of constant alarm by the Indians. They\r\nhave not the power, if they possessed the will, even to restrain lawless\r\nMexicans from passing the border and committing depredations on our remote\r\nsettlers. A state of anarchy and violence prevails throughout that distant\r\nfrontier. The laws are a dead letter and life and property wholly insecure.\r\nFor this reason the settlement of Arizona is arrested, whilst it is of\r\ngreat importance that a chain of inhabitants should extend all along its\r\nsouthern border sufficient for their own protection and that of the United\r\nStates mail passing to and from California. Well-founded apprehensions are\r\nnow entertained that the Indians and wandering Mexicans, equally lawless,\r\nmay break up the important stage and postal communication recently\r\nestablished between our Atlantic and Pacific possessions. This passes very\r\nnear to the Mexican boundary throughout the whole length of Arizona. I can\r\nimagine no possible remedy for these evils and no mode of restoring law and\r\norder on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the Government of the\r\nUnited States to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern portions\r\nof Chihuahua and Sonora and to establish military posts within the same;\r\nand this I earnestly recommend to Congress. This protection may be\r\nwithdrawn as soon as local governments shall be established in these\r\nMexican States capable of performing their duties to the United States,\r\nrestraining the lawless, and preserving peace along the border.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that this measure will be viewed in a friendly spirit by the\r\ngovernments and people of Chihuahua and Sonora, as it will prove equally\r\neffectual for the protection of their citizens on that remote and lawless\r\nfrontier as for citizens of the United States. And in this connection\r\npermit me to recall your attention to the condition of Arizona. The\r\npopulation of that Territory, numbering, as is alleged, more than 10,000\r\nsouls, are practically without a government, without laws, and without any\r\nregular administration of justice. Murder and other crimes are committed\r\nwith impunity. This state of things calls loudly for redress, and I\r\ntherefore repeat my recommendation for the establishment of a Territorial\r\ngovernment over Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe political condition of the narrow isthmus of Central America, through\r\nwhich transit routes pass between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, presents\r\na subject of deep interest to all commercial nations. It is over these\r\ntransits that a large proportion of the trade and travel between the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic continents is destined to pass. To the United States\r\nthese routes are of incalculable importance as a means of communication\r\nbetween their Atlantic and Pacific possessions. The latter now extend\r\nthroughout seventeen degrees of latitude on the Pacific coast, embracing\r\nthe important State of California and the flourishing territories of Oregon\r\nand Washington. All commercial nations therefore have a deep and direct\r\ninterest that these communications shall be rendered secure from\r\ninterruption. If an arm of the sea connecting the two oceans penetrated\r\nthrough Nicaragua and Costa Rica, it could not be pretended that these\r\nStates would have the right to arrest or retard its navigation to the\r\ninjury of other nations. The transit by land over this narrow isthmus\r\noccupies nearly the same position. It is a highway in which they themselves\r\nhave little interest when compared with the vast interests of the rest of\r\nthe world. Whilst their rights of sovereignty ought to be respected, it is\r\nthe duty of other nations to require that this important passage shall not\r\nbe interrupted by the civil wars and revolutionary outbreaks which have so\r\nfrequently occurred in that region. The stake is too important to be left\r\nat the mercy of rival companies claiming to hold conflicting contracts with\r\nNicaragua. The commerce of other nations is not to stand still and await\r\nthe adjustment of such petty controversies. The Government of the United\r\nStates expect no more than this, and they will not be satisfied with less.\r\nThey would not, if they could, derive any advantage from the Nicaragua\r\ntransit not common to the rest of the World. Its neutrality and protection\r\nfor the common use of all nations is their only object. They have no\r\nobjection that Nicaragua shall demand and receive a fair compensation from\r\nthe companies and individuals who may traverse the route, but they insist\r\nthat it shall never hereafter be closed by an arbitrary decree of that\r\nGovernment. If disputes arise between it and those with whom they may have\r\nentered into contracts, these must be adjusted by some fair tribunal\r\nprovided for the purpose, and the route must not be closed pending the\r\ncontroversy. This is our whole policy, and it can not fail to be acceptable\r\nto other nations.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties might be avoided if, consistently with the good\r\nfaith of Nicaragua, the use of this transit could be thrown open to general\r\ncompetition, providing at the same time for the payment of a reasonable\r\nrate to the Nicaraguan Government on passengers and freight. In August,\r\n1852, the Accessory Transit Company made its first interoceanic trip over\r\nthe Nicaraguan route, and continued in successful operation, with great\r\nadvantage to the public, until the 18th February, 1856, when it was closed\r\nand the grant to this company as well as its charter were summarily and\r\narbitrarily revoked by the Government of President Rivas. Previous to this\r\ndate, however, in 1854, serious disputes concerning the settlement of their\r\naccounts had arisen between the company and the Government, threatening the\r\ninterruption of the route at any moment. These the United States in vain\r\nendeavored to compose. It would be useless to narrate the various\r\nproceedings which took place between the parties up till the time when the\r\ntransit was discontinued. Suffice it to say that since February, 1856, it\r\nhas remained closed, greatly to the prejudice of citizens of the United\r\nStates. Since that time the competition has ceased between the rival routes\r\nof Panama and Nicaragua, and in consequence thereof an unjust and\r\nunreasonable amount has been exacted from our citizens for their passage to\r\nand from California.\r\n\r\nA treaty was signed on the 16th day of November, 1857, by the Secretary of\r\nState and minister of Nicaragua, under the stipulations of which the use\r\nand protection of the transit route would have been secured, not only to\r\nthe United States, but equally to all other nations. How and on what\r\npretext this treaty has failed to receive the ratification of the\r\nNicaraguan Government will appear by the papers herewith communicated from\r\nthe State Department. The principal objection seems to have been to the\r\nprovision authorizing the United States to employ force to keep the route\r\nopen in case Nicaragua should fail to perform her duty in this respect.\r\nFrom the feebleness of that Republic, its frequent changes of government,\r\nand its constant internal dissensions, this had become a most important\r\nstipulation, and one essentially necessary, not only for the security of\r\nthe route, but for the safety of American citizens passing and repassing to\r\nand from our Pacific possessions. Were such a stipulation embraced in a\r\ntreaty between the United States and Nicaragua, the knowledge of this fact\r\nwould of itself most probably prevent hostile parties from committing\r\naggressions on the route, and render our actual interference for its\r\nprotection unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign\r\nnations is limited to the employment of diplomacy alone. When this fails it\r\ncan proceed no further. It can not legitimately resort to force without the\r\ndirect authority of Congress, except in resisting and repelling hostile\r\nattacks. It would have no authority to enter the territories of Nicaragua\r\neven to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the lives and\r\nproperty of our own citizens on their passage. It is true that on a sudden\r\nemergency of this character the President would direct any armed force in\r\nthe vicinity to march to their relief, but in doing this he would act upon\r\nhis own responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I earnestly recommend to Congress the passage of\r\nan act authorizing the president, under such restrictions as they may deem\r\nproper, to employ the land and naval forces of the United States in\r\npreventing the transit from being obstructed or closed by lawless violence,\r\nand in protecting the lives and property of American citizens traveling\r\nthereupon, requiring at the same time that these forces shall be withdrawn\r\nthe moment the danger shall have passed away. Without such a provision our\r\ncitizens will be constantly exposed to interruption in their progress and\r\nto lawless violence.\r\n\r\nA similar necessity exists for the passage of such an act for the\r\nprotection of the Panama and Tehuantepec routes. In reference to the Panama\r\nroute, the United States, by their existing treaty with New Granada,\r\nexpressly guarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus, \"with the view that the\r\nfree transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted or\r\nembarrassed in any future time while this treaty exists.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Tehuantepec route, which has been recently opened under\r\nthe most favorable auspices, our treaty with Mexico of the 30th December,\r\n1853, secures to the citizens of the United States a right of transit over\r\nit for their persons and merchandise and stipulates that neither Government\r\nshall \"interpose any obstacle\" thereto. It also concedes to the United\r\nStates the \"right to transport across the Isthmus, in closed bags, the\r\nmails of the United States not intended for distribution along the line of\r\nthe communication; also the effects of the United States Government and its\r\ncitizens which may be intended for transit and not for distribution on the\r\nIsthmus, free of custom-house or other charges by the Mexican Government.\"\r\n\r\nThese treaty stipulations with New Granada and Mexico, in addition to the\r\nconsiderations applicable to the Nicaragua route, seem to require\r\nlegislation for the purpose of carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\nThe injuries which have been inflicted upon our citizens in Costa Rica and\r\nNicaragua during the last two or three years have received the prompt\r\nattention of this Government. Some of these injuries were of the most\r\naggravated character. The transaction at Virgin Bay in April, 1856, when a\r\ncompany of unarmed Americans, who were in no way connected with any\r\nbelligerent conduct or party, were fired upon by the troops of Costa Rica\r\nand numbers of them killed and wounded, was brought to the knowledge of\r\nCongress by my predecessor soon after its occurrence, and was also\r\npresented to the Government of Costa Rica for that immediate investigation\r\nand redress which the nature of the case demanded. A similar course was\r\npursued with reference to other outrages in these countries, some of which\r\nwere hardly less aggravated in their character than the transaction at\r\nVirgin Bay. At the time, however, when our present minister to Nicaragua\r\nwas appointed, in December, 1857, no redress had been obtained for any of\r\nthese wrongs and no reply even had been received to the demands which had\r\nbeen made by this Government upon that of Costa Rica more than a year\r\nbefore. Our minister was instructed, therefore, to lose no time in\r\nexpressing to those Governments the deep regret with which the President\r\nhad witnessed this inattention to the just claims of the United States and\r\nin demanding their prompt and satisfactory adjustment. Unless this demand\r\nshall be complied with at an early day it will only remain for this\r\nGovernment to adopt such other measures as may be necessary in order to\r\nobtain for itself that justice which it has in vain attempted to secure by\r\npeaceful means from the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. While it\r\nhas shown, and will continue to show, the most sincere regard for the\r\nrights and honor of these Republics, it can not permit this regard to be\r\nmet by an utter neglect on their part of what is due to the Government and\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nAgainst New Granada we have long-standing causes of complaint, arising out\r\nof the unsatisfied claims of our citizens upon that Republic, and to these\r\nhave been more recently added the outrages committed upon our citizens at\r\nPanama in April, 1856. A treaty for the adjustment of these difficulties\r\nwas concluded by the Secretary of State and the minister of New Granada in\r\nSeptember, 1857, which contained just and acceptable provisions for that\r\npurpose. This treaty was transmitted to Bogota and was ratified by the\r\nGovernment of New Granada, but with certain amendments. It was not,\r\nhowever, returned to this city until after the close of the last session of\r\nthe Senate. It will be immediately transmitted to that body for their\r\nadvice and consent, and should this be obtained it will remove all our\r\nexisting causes of complaint against New Granada on the subject of claims.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen between the two Governments as to the right of New\r\nGranada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessels of the United States in its\r\nports of the Isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon our citizens arriving\r\nin that country, whether with a design to remain there or to pass from\r\nocean to ocean by the transit route; and also a tax upon the mail of the\r\nUnited States transported over the Panama Railroad. The Government of New\r\nGranada has been informed that the United States would consider the\r\ncollection of either of these taxes as an act in violation of the treaty\r\nbetween the two countries, and as such would be resisted by the United\r\nStates. At the same time, we are prepared to discuss these questions in a\r\nspirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to adjust them in a\r\nsatisfactory manner. A negotiation for that purpose has already been\r\ncommenced. No effort has recently been made to collect these taxes nor is\r\nany anticipated under present circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith the Empire of Brazil our relations are of the most friendly character.\r\nThe productions of the two countries, and especially those of an\r\nagricultural nature, are such as to invite extensive mutual exchanges. A\r\nlarge quantity of American flour is consumed in Brazil, whilst more than\r\ntreble the amount in value of Brazilian coffee is consumed in the United\r\nStates. Whilst this is the case, a heavy duty has been levied until very\r\nrecently upon the importation of American flour into Brazil. I am\r\ngratified, however, to be able to inform you that in September last this\r\nhas been reduced from $1.32 to about 49 cents per barrel, and the duties on\r\nother articles of our production have been diminished in nearly the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nI regret to state that the Government of Brazil still continues to levy an\r\nexport duty of about 11 per cent on coffee, notwithstanding this article is\r\nadmitted free from duty in the United States. This is a heavy charge upon\r\nthe consumers of coffee in our country, as we purchase half of the entire\r\nsurplus crop of that article raised in Brazil. Our minister, under\r\ninstructions, will reiterate his efforts to have this export duty removed,\r\nand it is hoped that the enlightened Government of the Emperor will adopt\r\nthis wise, just, and equal policy. In that event, there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that the commerce between the two countries will greatly increase,\r\nmuch to the advantage of both. The claims of our citizens against the\r\nGovernment of Brazil are not in the aggregate of very large amount; but\r\nsome of these rest upon plain principles of justice and their settlement\r\nought not to be longer delayed. A renewed and earnest, and I trust a\r\nsuccessful, effort will be made by our minister to procure their final\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of June last Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the\r\nPresident \"to adopt such measures and use such force as in his judgment may\r\nbe necessary and advisable\" \"for the purpose of the differences between\r\nthe United States and the Republic of Paraguay, in connection with the\r\nattack on the United States steamer Water Witch and with other measures\r\nreferred to\" in his annual message, and on the 12th of July following they\r\nmade an appropriation to defray the expenses and compensation of a\r\ncommissioner to that Republic should the President deem it proper to make\r\nsuch all appointment.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with these enactments, I have appointed a commissioner, who\r\nhas proceeded to Paraguay with full powers and instructions to settle these\r\ndifferences in an amicable and peaceful manner if this be practicable. His\r\nexperience and discretion justify the hope that he may prove successful in\r\nconvincing the Paraguayan Government that it is due both to honor and\r\njustice that they should voluntarily and promptly make atonement for the\r\nwrongs which they have committed against the United States and indemnify\r\nour injured citizens whom they have forcibly despoiled of their property.\r\n\r\nShould our commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest\r\neffort to accomplish the object of his mission, then no alternative will\r\nremain but the employment of force to obtain \"just satisfaction\" from\r\nParaguay. In view of this contingency, the Secretary of the Navy, under my\r\ndirection, has fitted out and dispatched a naval force to rendezvous near\r\nBuenos Ayres, which, it is believed, will prove sufficient for the\r\noccasion. It is my earnest desire, however, that it may not be found\r\nnecessary to resort to this last alternative.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December last the business of the country had just\r\nbeen crushed by one of those periodical revulsions which are the inevitable\r\nconsequence of our unsound and extravagant system of bank credits and\r\ninflated currency. With all the elements of national wealth in abundance,\r\nour manufactures were suspended, our useful public and private enterprises\r\nwere arrested, and thousands of laborers were deprived of employment and\r\nreduced to want. Universal distress prevailed among the commercial,\r\nmanufacturing, and mechanical classes. This revulsion was felt the more\r\nseverely in the United States because similar causes had produced the like\r\ndeplorable effects throughout the commercial nations of Europe. All were\r\nexperiencing sad reverses at the same moment. Our manufacturers everywhere\r\nsuffered severely, not because of the recent reduction in the tariff of\r\nduties on imports, but because there was no demand at any price for their\r\nproductions. The people were obliged to restrict themselves in their\r\npurchases to articles of prime necessity. In the general prostration of\r\nbusiness the iron manufacturers in different States probably suffered more\r\nthan any other class, and much destitution was the inevitable consequence\r\namong the great number of workmen who had been employed in this useful\r\nbranch of industry. There could be no supply where there was no demand. To\r\npresent an example, there could be no demand for railroad iron after our\r\nmagnificent system of railroads, extending its benefits to every portion of\r\nthe Union, had been brought to a dead pause. The same consequences have\r\nresulted from similar causes to many other branches of useful manufactures.\r\nIt is self-evident that where there is no ability to purchase manufactured\r\narticles these can not be sold, and consequently must cease to be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nNo government, and especially a government of such limited powers as that\r\nof the United States, could have prevented the late revulsion. The whole\r\ncommercial world seemed for years to have been rushing to this catastrophe.\r\nThe same ruinous consequences would have followed in the United States\r\nwhether the duties upon foreign imports had remained as they were under the\r\ntariff of 1846 or had been raised to a much higher standard. The tariff of\r\n1857 had no agency in the result. The general causes existing throughout\r\nthe world could not have been controlled by the legislation of any\r\nparticular country.\r\n\r\nThe periodical revulsions which have existed in our past history must\r\ncontinue to return at intervals so long as our present unbounded system of\r\nbank credits shall prevail. They will, however, probably be the less severe\r\nin future, because it is not to be expected, at least for many years to\r\ncome, that the commercial nations of Europe, with whose interests our own\r\nare so materially involved, will expose themselves to similar calamities.\r\nBut this subject was treated so much at large in my last annual message\r\nthat I shall not now pursue it further. Still, I respectfully renew the\r\nrecommendation in favor of the passage of a uniform bankrupt law applicable\r\nto banking institutions. This is all the direct power over the subject\r\nwhich I believe the Federal Government possesses. Such a law would\r\nmitigate, though it might not prevent, the evil. The instinct of\r\nself-preservation might produce a wholesome restraint upon their banking\r\nbusiness if they knew in advance that a suspension of specie payments would\r\ninevitably produce their civil death.\r\n\r\nBut the effects of the revulsion are now slowly but surely passing away.\r\nThe energy and enterprise of our citizens, with our unbounded resources,\r\nwill within the period of another year restore a state of wholesome\r\nindustry and trade. Capital has again accumulated in our large cities. The\r\nrate of interest is there very low. Confidence is gradually reviving, and\r\nso soon as it is discovered that this capital can be profitably employed in\r\ncommercial and manufacturing enterprises and in the construction of\r\nrailroads and other works of public and private improvement prosperity will\r\nagain smile throughout the land. It is vain, however, to disguise the fact\r\nfrom ourselves that a speculative inflation of our currency without a\r\ncorresponding inflation in other countries whose manufactures come into\r\ncompetition with our own must ever produce disastrous results to our\r\ndomestic manufactures. No tariff short of absolute prohibition can prevent\r\nthese evil consequences. In connection with this subject it is proper to\r\nrefer to our financial condition. The same causes which have produced\r\npecuniary distress throughout the country have so reduced the amount of\r\nimports from foreign countries that the revenue has proved inadequate to\r\nmeet the necessary expenses of the Government. To supply the deficiency,\r\nCongress, by the act of December 23, 1857, authorized the issue of\r\n$20,000,000 of Treasury notes; and this proving inadequate, they\r\nauthorized, by the act of June 14, 1858, a loan of $20,000,000, to be\r\napplied to the payment of appropriations made by law.\"\r\n\r\nNo statesman would advise that we should go on increasing the national debt\r\nto meet the ordinary expenses of the Government. This would be a most\r\nruinous policy. In case of war our credit must be our chief resource, at\r\nleast for the first year, and this would be greatly impaired by having\r\ncontracted a large debt in time of peace. It is our true policy to increase\r\nour revenue so as to equal our expenditures. It would be ruinous to\r\ncontinue to borrow. Besides, it may be proper to observe that the\r\nincidental protection thus afforded by a revenue tariff would at the\r\npresent moment to some extent increase the confidence of the manufacturing\r\ninterests and give a fresh impulse to our reviving business. To this surely\r\nno person will object.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mode of assessing and collecting duties under a strictly\r\nrevenue tariff, I have long entertained and often expressed the opinion\r\nthat sound policy requires this should be done by specific duties in cases\r\nto which these can be properly applied. They are well adapted to\r\ncommodities which are usually sold by weight or by measure, and which from\r\ntheir nature are of equal or of nearly equal value. Such, for example, are\r\nthe articles of iron of different classes, raw sugar, and foreign wines and\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nIn my deliberate judgment specific duties are the best, if not the only,\r\nmeans of securing the revenue against false and fraudulent invoices, and\r\nsuch has been the practice adopted for this purpose by other commercial\r\nnations. Besides, specific duties would afford to the American manufacturer\r\nthe incidental advantages to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue\r\ntariff. The present system is a sliding scale to his disadvantage. Under\r\nit, when prices are high and business prosperous, the duties rise in amount\r\nwhen he least requires their aid. On the contrary, when prices fall and he\r\nis struggling against adversity, the duties are diminished in the same\r\nproportion, greatly to his injury. Neither would there be danger that a\r\nhigher rate of duty than that intended by Congress could be levied in the\r\nform of specific duties. It would be easy to ascertain the average value of\r\nany imported article for a series of years, and, instead of subjecting it\r\nto an ad valorem duty at a certain rate per centum, to substitute in its\r\nplace an equivalent specific duty.\r\n\r\nBy such an arrangement the consumer would not be injured. It is true he\r\nmight have to pay a little more duty on a given article in one year, but,\r\nif so, he would pay a little less in another, and in a series of years\r\nthese would counterbalance each other and amount to the same thing so far\r\nas his interest is concerned. This inconvenience would be trifling when\r\ncontrasted with the additional security thus afforded against frauds upon\r\nthe revenue, in which every consumer is directly interested.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out these suggestions as the fruit of my own observation, to\r\nwhich Congress, in their better judgment, will give such weight as they may\r\njustly deserve.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the\r\noperations of that Department of the Government. The receipts into the\r\nTreasury from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1858,\r\nincluding the Treasury notes authorized by the act of December 23, 1857,\r\nwere $70,273,869.59, which amount, with the balance of $17,710,114.27\r\nremaining in the Treasury at the commencement of the year, made an\r\naggregate for the service of the year of $87,983,983.86.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1858,\r\namounted to $81,585,667.76, of which $9,684,537.99 were applied to the\r\npayment of the public debt and the redemption of Treasury notes with the\r\ninterest thereon, leaving in the Treasury on July 1, 1858, being the\r\ncommencement of the present fiscal year, $6,398,316.10.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the first quarter of the present\r\nfiscal year, commencing the 1st of July, 1858, including one-half of the\r\nloan of $20,000,000, with the premium upon it, authorized by the act of\r\nJune 14, 1858, were $25,230,879.46, and the estimated receipts for the\r\nremaining three quarters to the 30th of June, 1859, from ordinary sources\r\nare $38,500,000, making, with the balance before stated, an aggregate of\r\n$70,129,195.56.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year were\r\n$21,708,198.51, of which $1,010,142.37 were applied to the payment of the\r\npublic debt and the redemption of Treasury notes and the interest thereon.\r\nThe estimated expenditures during the remaining three quarters to June 30,\r\n1859, are $52,357,698.48, making an aggregate of $74,065,896.99, being an\r\nexcess of expenditure beyond the estimated receipts into the Treasury from\r\nordinary sources during the fiscal year to the 30th of June, 1859, of\r\n$3,936,701.43. Extraordinary means are placed by law within the command of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, by the reissue of Treasury notes redeemed\r\nand by negotiating the balance of the loan authorized by the act of June\r\n14, 1858, to the extent of $11,000,000, which, if realized during the\r\npresent fiscal year, will leave a balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1859, of $7,063,298.57.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1860,\r\nare $62,000,000, which, with the above-estimated balance of $7,063,298.57\r\nmake an aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year of\r\n$69,063,298.57. The estimated expenditures during the next fiscal year,\r\nending June 30, 1860, are $73,139,147.46, which leaves a deficit of\r\nestimated means, compared with the estimated expenditures, for that year,\r\ncommencing on July 1, 1859, of $4,075,848.89.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this sum the Postmaster-General will require from the\r\nTreasury for the service of the Post-Office Department $3,838,728, as\r\nexplained in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which will\r\nincrease the estimated deficit on June 30, 1860, to $7,914,576.89. To\r\nprovide for the payment of this estimated deficiency, which will be\r\nincreased by such appropriations as may be made by Congress not estimated\r\nfor in the report of the Treasury Department, as well as to provide for the\r\ngradual redemption from year to year of the outstanding Treasury notes, the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury recommends such a revision of the present tariff\r\nas will raise the required amount. After what I have already said I need\r\nscarcely add that I concur in the opinion expressed in his report--that the\r\npublic debt should not be increased by an additional loan--and would\r\ntherefore strongly urge upon Congress the duty of making at their present\r\nsession the necessary provision for meeting these liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on July 1, 1858, the commencement of the present fiscal\r\nyear, was $25,155,977.66.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the present year the sum of $10,000,000 has\r\nbeen negotiated of the loan authorized by the act of June 14, 1858, making\r\nthe present outstanding public debt, exclusive of Treasury notes,\r\n$35,155,977.66. There was on the 1st of July, 1858, of Treasury notes\r\nissued by authority of the act of December 23, 1857, unredeemed, the sum of\r\n$19,754,800, making the amount of actual indebtedness at that date\r\n$54,910,777.66. To this will be added $10,000,000 during the present fiscal\r\nyear, this being the remaining half of the loan of $20,000,000 not yet\r\nnegotiated.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exists for a\r\nmodification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expenses of the\r\nGovernment ought to admonish us all, in our respective spheres of duty, to\r\nthe practice of rigid economy. The objects of expenditure should be limited\r\nin number, as far as this may be practicable, and the appropriations\r\nnecessary to carry them into effect ought to be disbursed under the\r\nstrictest accountability. Enlightened economy does not consist in the\r\nrefusal to appropriate money for constitutional purposes essential to the\r\ndefense, progress, and prosperity of the Republic, but in taking care that\r\nnone of this money shall be wasted by mismanagement in its application to\r\nthe objects designated by law.\r\n\r\nComparisons between the annual expenditure at the present time and what it\r\nwas ten or twenty years ago are altogether fallacious. The rapid increase\r\nof our country in extent and population renders a corresponding increase of\r\nexpenditure to some extent unavoidable. This is constantly creating new\r\nobjects of expenditure and augmenting the amount required for the old. The\r\ntrue questions, then, are, Have these objects been unnecessarily\r\nmultiplied, or has the amount expended upon any or all of them been larger\r\nthan comports with due economy? In accordance with these principles, the\r\nheads of the different Executive Departments of the Government have been\r\ninstructed to reduce their estimates for the next fiscal year to the lowest\r\nstandard consistent with the efficiency of the service, and this duty they\r\nhave performed in a spirit of just economy. The estimates of the Treasury,\r\nWar, Navy, and Interior Departments have each been in some degree reduced,\r\nand unless a sudden and unforeseen emergency should arise it is not\r\nanticipated that a deficiency will exist in either within the present or\r\nthe next fiscal year. The Post-Office Department is placed in a peculiar\r\nposition, different from the other Departments, and to this I shall\r\nhereafter refer.\r\n\r\nI invite Congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the\r\nexpenses in all the Departments can not be still further reduced, and I\r\npromise them all the aid in my power in pursuing the investigation.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports made to me by the Secretaries of War, of\r\nthe Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. They each contain\r\nvaluable information and important recommendations, to which I invite the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I took occasion to recommend the immediate\r\nconstruction of ten small steamers of light draft, for the purpose of\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the Navy. Congress responded to the\r\nrecommendation by authorizing the construction of eight of them. The\r\nprogress which has been made in executing this authority is stated in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Navy. I concur with him in the opinion that\r\na greater number of this class of vessels is necessary for the purpose of\r\nprotecting in a more efficient manner the persons and property of American\r\ncitizens on the high seas and in foreign countries, as well as in guarding\r\nmore effectually our own coasts. I accordingly recommend the passage of an\r\nact for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nespecially those in regard to the disposition of the public domain, the\r\npension and bounty-land system, the policy toward the Indians, and the\r\namendment of our patent laws, are worthy of the serious consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Department occupies a position very different from that of\r\nthe other Departments. For many years it was the policy of the Government\r\nto render this a self-sustaining Department; and if this can not now be\r\naccomplished, in the present condition of the country, we ought to make as\r\nnear an approach to it as may be practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General is placed in a most embarrassing position by the\r\nexisting laws. He is obliged to carry these into effect. He has no other\r\nalternative. He finds, however, that this can not be done without heavy\r\ndemands upon the Treasury over and above what is received for postage, and\r\nthese have been progressively increasing from year to year until they\r\namounted for the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1858, to\r\nmore than $4,500,000, whilst it is estimated that for the present fiscal\r\nyear they will amount to $6,290,000. These sums are exclusive of the annual\r\nappropriation of $700,000 for \"compensation for the mail service performed\r\nfor the two Houses of Congress and the other Departments and officers of\r\nthe Government in the transmission of free matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of these large deficits is mainly attributable to the increased\r\nexpense of transporting the mails. In 1852 the sum paid for this service\r\nwas but a fraction above four millions and a quarter. Since that year it\r\nhas annually increased, until in 1858 it has reached more than eight\r\nmillions and a quarter, and for the service of 1859 it is estimated that it\r\nwill amount to more than $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Post-Office Department can be made to approach or to\r\nequal its expenditure only by means of the legislation of Congress. In\r\napplying any remedy care should be taken that the people shall not be\r\ndeprived of the advantages which they are fairly entitled to enjoy from the\r\nPost-Office Department. The principal remedies recommended to the\r\nconsideration of Congress by the Postmaster-General are to restore the\r\nformer rate of postage upon single letters to 5 cents; to substitute for\r\nthe franking privilege the delivery to those now entitled to enjoy it of\r\npost-office stamps for their correspondence, and to direct the Department\r\nin making contracts for the transportation of the mail to confine itself to\r\nthe payment of the sum necessary for this single purpose, without requiring\r\nit to be transported in post coaches or carriages of any particular\r\ndescription. Under the present system the expense to the Government is\r\ngreatly increased by requiring that the mail shall be carried in such\r\nvehicles as will accommodate passengers. This will be done, without pay\r\nfrom the Department, over all roads where the travel will remunerate the\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations deserve the grave consideration of Congress. I would\r\nagain call your attention to the construction of a Pacific railroad. Time\r\nand reflection have but served to confirm me in the truth and justice of\r\nthe observations which I made on this subject in my last annual message, to\r\nwhich I beg leave respectfully to refer.\r\n\r\nIt is freely admitted that it would be inexpedient for this Government to\r\nexercise the power of constructing the Pacific railroad by its own\r\nimmediate agents. Such a policy would increase the patronage of the\r\nExecutive to a dangerous extent, and introduce a system of jobbing and\r\ncorruption which no vigilance on the part of Federal officials could either\r\nprevent or detect. This can only be done by the keen eye and active and\r\ncareful supervision of individual and private interest. The construction of\r\nthis road ought therefore to be committed to companies incorporated by the\r\nStates or other agencies whose pecuniary interests would be directly\r\ninvolved. Congress might then assist them in the work by grants of land or\r\nof money, or both, under such conditions and restrictions as would secure\r\nthe transportation of troops and munitions of war free from any charge and\r\nthat of the United States mail at a fair and reasonable price.\r\n\r\nThe progress of events since the commencement of your last session has\r\nshown how soon difficulties disappear before a firm and determined\r\nresolution. At that time such a road was deemed by wise and patriotic men\r\nto be a visionary project. The great distance to be overcome and the\r\nintervening mountains and deserts in the way were obstacles which, in the\r\nopinion of many, could not be surmounted. Now, after the lapse of but a\r\nsingle year, these obstacles, it has been discovered, are far less\r\nformidable than they were supposed to be, and mail stages with passengers\r\nnow pass and repass regularly twice in each week, by a common wagon road,\r\nbetween San Francisco and St. Louis and Memphis in less than twenty-five\r\ndays. The service has been as regularly performed as it was in former years\r\nbetween New York and this city.\r\n\r\nWhilst disclaiming all authority to appropriate money for the construction\r\nof this road, except that derived from the war-making power of the\r\nConstitution, there are important collateral considerations urging us to\r\nundertake the work as speedily as possible. The first and most momentous of\r\nthese is that such a road would be a powerful bond of union between the\r\nStates east and west of the Rocky Mountains. This is so self-evident as to\r\nrequire no illustration.\r\n\r\nBut again, in a commercial point of view, I consider this the great\r\nquestion of the day. With the eastern front of our Republic stretching\r\nalong the Atlantic and its western front along the Pacific, if all the\r\nparts should be united by a safe, easy, and rapid intercommunication we\r\nmust necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of\r\nEurope and Asia. Our recent treaties with China and Japan will open these\r\nrich and populous Empires to our commerce; and the history of the world\r\nproves that the nation which has gained possession of the trade with\r\neastern Asia has always become wealthy and powerful. The peculiar\r\ngeographical position of California and our Pacific possessions invites\r\nAmerican capital and enterprise into this fruitful field. To reap the rich\r\nharvest, however, it is an indispensable prerequisite that we shall first\r\nhave a railroad to convey and circulate its products throughout every\r\nportion of the Union. Besides, such a railroad through our temperate\r\nlatitude, which would not be impeded by the frosts and snows of winter nor\r\nby the tropical heats of summer, would attract to itself much of the travel\r\nand the trade of all nations passing between Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of August last Lieutenant J. N. Maffit, of the United States\r\nbrig Dolphin, captured the slaver Echo (formerly the Putnam, of New\r\nOrleans) near Kay Verde, on the coast of Cuba, with more than 300 African\r\nnegroes on board. The prize, under the command of Lieutenant Bradford, of\r\nthe United States Navy, arrived at Charleston on the 27th August, when the\r\nnegroes, 306 in number, were delivered into the custody of the United\r\nStates marshal for the district of South Carolina. They were first placed\r\nin Castle Pinckney, and afterwards in Fort Sumter, for safe-keeping, and\r\nwere detained there until the 19th September, when the survivors, 271 in\r\nnumber, were delivered on board the United States steamer Niagara to be\r\ntransported to the coast of Africa under the charge of the agent of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the provisions of the act of the 3d March, 1819,\r\n\"in addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade.\" Under the second\r\nsection of this act the President is \"authorized to make such regulations\r\nand arrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping, support,\r\nand removal beyond the limits of the United States of all such negroes,\r\nmulattoes, or persons of color\" captured by vessels of the United States as\r\nmay be delivered to the marshal of the district into which they are\r\nbrought, \"and to appoint a proper person or persons residing upon the coast\r\nof Africa as agent or agents for receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or\r\npersons of color delivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution\r\nof the slave trade by commanders of United States armed vessels.\"\r\n\r\nA doubt immediately arose as to the true construction of this act. It is\r\nquite clear from its terms that the President was authorized to provide\r\n\"for the safe-keeping, support, and removal\" of these negroes up till the\r\ntime of their delivery to the agent on the coast of Africa, but no express\r\nprovision was made for their protection and support after they had reached\r\nthe place of their destination. Still, an agent was to be pointed to\r\nreceive them in Africa, and it could not have been supposed that Congress\r\nintended he should desert them at the moment they were received and turn\r\nthem loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to\r\nbecome again the victims of the slave trade. Had this been the intention of\r\nCongress, the employment of an agent to receive them, who is required to\r\nreside on the coast, was unnecessary, and they might have been landed by\r\nour vessels anywhere in Africa and left exposed to the sufferings and the\r\nfate which would certainly await them.\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe, in his special message of December 17, 1819, at the first\r\nsession after the act was passed, announced to Congress what in his opinion\r\nwas its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under it to follow\r\nthese unfortunates into Africa and make provision for them there until they\r\nshould be able to provide for themselves. In communicating this\r\ninterpretation of the act to Congress he stated that some doubt had been\r\nentertained as to its true intent and meaning, and he submitted the\r\nquestion to them so that they might, \"should it be deemed advisable, amend\r\nthe same before further proceedings are had under it.\" Nothing was done by\r\nCongress to explain the act, and Mr. Monroe proceeded to carry it into\r\nexecution according to his own interpretation. This, then, became the\r\npractical construction. When the Africans from on board the Echo were\r\ndelivered to the marshal at Charleston, it became my duty to consider what\r\ndisposition ought to be made of them under the law. For many reasons it was\r\nexpedient to remove them from that locality as speedily as possible.\r\nAlthough the conduct of the authorities and citizens of Charleston in\r\ngiving countenance to the execution of the law was just what might have\r\nbeen expected from their high character, yet a prolonged continuance of 300\r\nAfricans in the immediate vicinity of that city could not have failed to\r\nbecome a source of inconvenience and anxiety to its inhabitants. Where to\r\nsend them was the question. There was no portion of the coast of Africa to\r\nwhich they could be removed with any regard to humanity except to Liberia.\r\nUnder these circumstances an agreement was entered into with the\r\nColonization Society on the 7th of September last, a copy of which is\r\nherewith transmitted, under which the society engaged, for the\r\nconsideration of $45,000, to receive these Africans in Liberia from the\r\nagent of the United States and furnish them during the period of one year\r\nthereafter with comfortable shelter, clothing, provisions, and medical\r\nattendance, causing the children to receive schooling, and all, whether\r\nchildren or adults, to be instructed in the arts of civilized life suitable\r\nto their condition. This aggregate of $45,000 was based upon an allowance\r\nof $150 for each individual; and as there has been considerable mortality\r\namong them and may be more before they reach Africa, the society have\r\nagreed, in an equitable spirit, to make such a deduction from the amount as\r\nunder the circumstances may appear just and reasonable. This can not be\r\nfixed until we shall ascertain the actual number which may become a charge\r\nto the society. It was also distinctly agreed that under no circumstances\r\nshall this Government be called upon for any additional expenses. The\r\nagents of the society manifested a laudable desire to conform to the wishes\r\nof the Government throughout the transaction. They assured me that after a\r\ncareful calculation they would be required to expend the sum of $150 on\r\neach individual in complying with the agreement, and they would have\r\nnothing left to remunerate them for their care, trouble, and\r\nresponsibility. At all events, I could make no better arrangement, and\r\nthere was no other alternative. During the period when the Government\r\nitself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing for\r\ncaptured negroes in Africa the cost per head was very much greater.\r\n\r\nThere having been no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose,\r\nI could not advance any money on the agreement. I therefore recommend that\r\nan appropriation may be made of the amount necessary to carry it into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOther captures of a similar character may, and probably will, be made by\r\nour naval forces, and I earnestly recommend that Congress may amend the\r\nsecond section of the act of March 3, 1819, so as to free its construction\r\nfrom the ambiguity which has so long existed and render the duty of the\r\nPresident plain in executing its provisions.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable regard the local interests of the District of\r\nColumbia. As the residence of Congress and the Executive Departments of the\r\nGovernment, we can not fail to feel a deep concern in its welfare. This is\r\nheightened by the high character and the peaceful and orderly conduct of\r\nits resident inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude without performing the agreeable duty of expressing my\r\ngratification that Congress so kindly responded to the recommendation of my\r\nlast annual message by affording me sufficient time before the close of\r\ntheir late session for the examination of all the bills presented to me for\r\napproval. This change in the practice of Congress has proved to be a\r\nwholesome reform. It exerted a beneficial influence on the transaction of\r\nlegislative business and elicited the general approbation of the country.\r\nIt enabled Congress to adjourn with that dignity and deliberation so\r\nbecoming to the representatives of this great Republic, without having\r\ncrowded into general appropriation bills provisions foreign to their nature\r\nand of doubtful constitutionality and expediency. Let me warmly and\r\nstrongly commend this precedent established by themselves as a guide to\r\ntheir proceedings during the present session.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Buchanan\r\nDecember 19, 1859\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOur deep and heartfelt gratitude is due to that Almighty Power which has\r\nbestowed upon us such varied and numerous blessings throughout the past\r\nyear. The general health of the country has been excellent, our harvests\r\nhave been unusually plentiful, and prosperity smiles throughout the land.\r\nIndeed, notwithstanding our demerits, we have much reason to believe from\r\nthe past events in our history that we have enjoyed the special protection\r\nof Divine Providence ever since our origin as a nation. We have been\r\nexposed to many threatening and alarming difficulties in our progress, but\r\non each successive occasion the impending cloud has been dissipated at the\r\nmoment it appeared ready to burst upon our head, and the danger to our\r\ninstitutions has passed away. May we ever be under the divine guidance and\r\nprotection. Whilst it is the duty of the President \"from time to time to\r\ngive to Congress information of the state of the Union,\" I shall not refer\r\nin detail to the recent sad and bloody occurrences at Harpers Ferry. Still,\r\nit is proper to observe that these events, however bad and cruel in\r\nthemselves, derive their chief importance from the apprehension that they\r\nare but symptoms of an incurable disease in the public mind, which may\r\nbreak out in still more dangerous outrages and terminate at last in an open\r\nwar by the North to abolish slavery in the South. Whilst for myself I\r\nentertain no such apprehension, they ought to afford a solemn warning to us\r\nall to beware of the approach of danger. Our Union is a stake of such\r\ninestimable value as to demand our constant and watchful vigilance for its\r\npreservation. In this view, let me implore my countrymen, North and South,\r\nto cultivate the ancient feelings of mutual forbearance and good will\r\ntoward each other and strive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred\r\nand strife now alive in the land. This advice proceeds from the heart of an\r\nold public functionary whose service commenced in the last generation,\r\namong the wise and conservative statesmen of that day, now nearly all\r\npassed away, and whose first and dearest earthly wish is to leave his\r\ncountry tranquil, prosperous, united, and powerful.\r\n\r\nWe ought to reflect that in this age, and especially in this country, there\r\nis an incessant flux and reflux of public opinion. Questions which in their\r\nday assumed a most threatening aspect have now nearly gone from the memory\r\nof men. They are \"volcanoes burnt out, and on the lava and ashes and\r\nsqualid scoria of old eruptions grow the peaceful olive, the cheering vine,\r\nand the sustaining corn.\" Such, in my opinion, will prove to be the fate of\r\nthe present sectional excitement should those who wisely seek to apply the\r\nremedy continue always to confine their efforts within the pale of the\r\nConstitution. If this course be pursued, the existing agitation on the\r\nsubject of domestic slavery, like everything human, will have its day and\r\ngive place to other and less threatening controversies. Public opinion in\r\nthis country is all-powerful, and when it reaches a dangerous excess upon\r\nany question the good sense of the people will furnish the corrective and\r\nbring it back within safe limits. Still, to hasten this auspicious result\r\nat the present crisis we ought to remember that every rational creature\r\nmust be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own teachings.\r\nThose who announce abstract doctrines subversive of the Constitution and\r\nthe Union must not be surprised should their heated partisans advance one\r\nstep further and attempt by violence to carry these doctrines into\r\npractical effect. In this view of the subject, it ought never to be\r\nforgotten that however great may have been the political advantages\r\nresulting from the Union to every portion of our common country, these\r\nwould all prove to be as nothing should the time ever arrive when they can\r\nnot be enjoyed without serious danger to the personal safety of the people\r\nof fifteen members of the Confederacy. If the peace of the domestic\r\nfireside throughout these States should ever be invaded, if the mothers of\r\nfamilies within this extensive region should not be able to retire to rest\r\nat night without suffering dreadful apprehensions of what may be their own\r\nfate and that of their children before the morning, it would be vain to\r\nrecount to such a people the political benefits which result to them from\r\nthe Union. Self-preservation is the first instinct of nature, and therefore\r\nany state of society in which the sword is all the time suspended over the\r\nheads of the people must at last become intolerable. But I indulge in no\r\nsuch gloomy forebodings. On the contrary, I firmly believe that the events\r\nat Harpers Ferry, by causing the people to pause and reflect upon the\r\npossible peril to their cherished institutions, will be the means under\r\nProvidence of allaying the existing excitement and preventing further\r\noutbreaks of a similar character. They will resolve that the Constitution\r\nand the Union shall not be endangered by rash counsels, knowing that should\r\n\"the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken at the fountain\"\r\nhuman power could never reunite the scattered and hostile fragments.\r\n\r\nI cordially congratulate you upon the final settlement by the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States of the question of slavery in the Territories, which\r\nhad presented an aspect so truly formidable at the commencement of my\r\nAdministration. The right has been established of every citizen to take his\r\nproperty of any kind, including slaves, into the common Territories\r\nbelonging equally to all the States of the Confederacy, and to have it\r\nprotected there under the Federal Constitution. Neither Congress nor a\r\nTerritorial legislature nor any human power has any authority to annul or\r\nimpair this vested right. The supreme judicial tribunal of the country,\r\nwhich is a coordinate branch of the Government, has sanctioned and affirmed\r\nthese principles of constitutional law, so manifestly just in themselves\r\nand so well calculated to promote peace and harmony among the States. It is\r\na striking proof of the sense of justice which is inherent in our people\r\nthat the property in slaves has never been disturbed, to my knowledge, in\r\nany of the Territories. Even throughout the late troubles in Kansas there\r\nhas not been any attempt, as I am credibly informed, to interfere in a\r\nsingle instance with the right of the master. Had any such attempt been\r\nmade, the judiciary would doubtless have afforded an adequate remedy.\r\nShould they fail to do this hereafter, it will then be time enough to\r\nstrengthen their hands by further legislation. Had it been decided that\r\neither Congress or the Territorial legislature possess the power to annul\r\nor impair the right to property in slaves, the evil would be intolerable.\r\nIn the latter event there would be a struggle for a majority of the members\r\nof the legislature at each successive election, and the sacred rights of\r\nproperty held under the Federal Constitution would depend for the time\r\nbeing on the result. The agitation would thus be rendered incessant whilst\r\nthe Territorial condition remained, and its baneful influence would keep\r\nalive a dangerous excitement among the people of the several States.\r\n\r\nThus has the status of a Territory during the intermediate period from its\r\nfirst settlement until it shall become a State been irrevocably fixed by\r\nthe final decision of the Supreme Court. Fortunate has this been for the\r\nprosperity of the Territories, as well as the tranquillity of the States.\r\nNow emigrants from the North and the South, the East and the West, will\r\nmeet in the Territories on a common platform, having brought with them that\r\nspecies of property best adapted, in their own opinion, to promote their\r\nwelfare. From natural causes the slavery question will in each case soon\r\nvirtually settle itself, and before the Territory is prepared for admission\r\nas a State into the Union this decision, one way or the other, will have\r\nbeen a foregone conclusion. Meanwhile the settlement of the new Territory\r\nwill proceed without serious interruption, and its progress and prosperity\r\nwill not be endangered or retarded by violent political struggles.\r\n\r\nWhen in the progress of events the inhabitants of any Territory shall have\r\nreached the number required to form a State, they will then proceed in a\r\nregular manner and in the exercise of the rights of popular sovereignty to\r\nform a constitution preparatory to admission into the Union. After this has\r\nbeen done, to employ the language of the Kansas and Nebraska act, they\r\n\"shall be received into the Union with or without slavery, as their\r\nconstitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.\" This sound\r\nprinciple has happily been recognized in some form or other by an almost\r\nunanimous vote of both Houses of the last Congress.\r\n\r\nAll lawful means at my command have been employed, and shall continue to be\r\nemployed, to execute the laws against the African slave trade. After a most\r\ncareful and rigorous examination of our coasts and a thorough investigation\r\nof the subject, we have not been able to discover that any slaves have been\r\nimported into the United States except the cargo by the Wanderer, numbering\r\nbetween three and four hundred. Those engaged in this unlawful enterprise\r\nhave been rigorously prosecuted, but not with as much success as their\r\ncrimes have deserved. A number of them are still under prosecution.\r\n\r\nOur history proves that the fathers of the Republic, in advance of all\r\nother nations, condemned the African slave trade. It was, notwithstanding,\r\ndeemed expedient by the framers of the Constitution to deprive Congress of\r\nthe power to prohibit \"the migration or importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States now existing shall think proper to admit\" \"prior to the year\r\n1808.\" It will be seen that this restriction on the power of Congress was\r\nconfined to such States only as might think proper to admit the importation\r\nof slaves. It did not extend to other States or to the trade carried on\r\nabroad. Accordingly, we find that so early as the 22d March, 1794, Congress\r\npassed an act imposing severe penalties and punishments upon citizens and\r\nresidents of the United States who should engage in this trade between\r\nforeign nations. The provisions of this act were extended and enforced by\r\nthe act of 10th May, 1800.\r\n\r\nAgain, the States themselves had a clear right to waive the constitutional\r\nprivilege intended for their benefit, and to prohibit by their own laws\r\nthis trade at any time they thought proper previous to 1808. Several of\r\nthem exercised this right before that period, and among them some\r\ncontaining the greatest number of slaves. This gave to Congress the\r\nimmediate power to act in regard to all such States, because they\r\nthemselves had removed the constitutional barrier. Congress accordingly\r\npassed an act on 28th February, 1803, \"to prevent the importation of\r\ncertain persons into certain States where by the laws thereof their\r\nadmission is prohibited.\" In this manner the importation of African slaves\r\ninto the United States was to a great extent prohibited some years in\r\nadvance of 1808.\r\n\r\nAs the year 1808 approached Congress determined not to suffer this trade to\r\nexist even for a single day after they had the power to abolish it. On the\r\n2d of March, 1807, they passed an act, to take effect \"from and after the\r\n1st day of January, 1808,\" prohibiting the importation of African slaves\r\ninto the United States. This was followed by subsequent acts of a similar\r\ncharacter, to which I need not specially refer. Such were the principles\r\nand such the practice of our ancestors more than fifty years ago in regard\r\nto the African slave trade. It did not occur to the revered patriots who\r\nhad been delegates to the Convention, and afterwards became members of\r\nCongress, that in passing these laws they had violated the Constitution\r\nwhich they had framed with so much care and deliberation. They supposed\r\nthat to prohibit Congress in express terms from exercising a specified\r\npower before an appointed day necessarily involved the right to exercise\r\nthis power after that day had arrived.\r\n\r\nIf this were not the case, the framers of the Constitution had expended\r\nmuch labor in vain. Had they imagined that Congress would possess no power\r\nto prohibit the trade either before or after 1808, they would not have\r\ntaken so much care to protect the States against the exercise of this power\r\nbefore that period. Nay, more, they would not have attached such vast\r\nimportance to this provision as to have excluded it from the possibility of\r\nfuture repeal or amendment, to which other portions of the Constitution\r\nwere exposed. It would, then, have been wholly unnecessary to ingraft on\r\nthe fifth article of the Constitution, prescribing the mode of its own\r\nfuture amendment, the proviso \"that no amendment which may be made prior to\r\nthe year 1808 shall in any manner affect\" the provision in the Constitution\r\nsecuring to the States the right to admit the importation of African slaves\r\nprevious to that period. According to the adverse construction, the clause\r\nitself, on which so much care and discussion had been employed by the\r\nmembers of the Convention, was an absolute nullity from the beginning, and\r\nall that has since been done under it a mere usurpation.\r\n\r\nIt was well and wise to confer this power on Congress, because had it been\r\nleft to the States its efficient exercise would have been impossible. In\r\nthat event any one State could have effectually continued the trade, not\r\nonly for itself, but for all the other slave States, though never so much\r\nagainst their will. And why? Because African slaves, when once brought\r\nwithin the limits of any one State in accordance with its laws, can not\r\npractically be excluded from any State where slavery exists. And even if\r\nall the States had separately passed laws prohibiting the importation of\r\nslaves, these laws would have failed of effect for want of a naval force to\r\ncapture the slavers and to guard the coast. Such a force no State can\r\nemploy in time of peace without the consent of Congress.\r\n\r\nThese acts of Congress, it is believed, have, with very rare and\r\ninsignificant exceptions, accomplished their purpose. For a period of more\r\nthan half a century there has been no perceptible addition to the number of\r\nour domestic slaves. During this period their advancement in civilization\r\nhas far surpassed that of any other portion of the African race. The light\r\nand the blessings of Christianity have been extended to them, and both\r\ntheir moral and physical condition has been greatly improved.\r\n\r\nReopen the trade and it would be difficult to determine whether the effect\r\nwould be more deleterious on the interests of the master or on those of the\r\nnative-born slave. Of the evils to the master, the one most to be dreaded\r\nwould be the introduction of wild, heathen, and ignorant barbarians among\r\nthe sober, orderly, and quiet slaves whose ancestors have been on the soil\r\nfor several generations. This might tend to barbarize, demoralize, and\r\nexasperate the whole mass and produce most deplorable consequences.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the existing slave would, if possible, be still more\r\ndeplorable. At present he is treated with kindness and humanity. He is well\r\nfed, well clothed, and not overworked. His condition is incomparably better\r\nthan that of the coolies which modern nations of high civilization have\r\nemployed as a substitute for African slaves. Both the philanthropy and the\r\nself-interest of the master have combined to produce this humane result.\r\nBut let this trade be reopened and what will be the effect? The same to a\r\nconsiderable extent as on a neighboring island, the only spot now on earth\r\nwhere the African slave trade is openly tolerated, and this in defiance of\r\nsolemn treaties with a power abundantly able at any moment to enforce their\r\nexecution. There the master, intent upon present gain, extorts from the\r\nslave as much labor as his physical powers are capable of enduring, knowing\r\nthat when death comes to his relief his place can be supplied at a price\r\nreduced to the lowest point by the competition of rival African slave\r\ntraders. Should this ever be the case in our country, which I do not deem\r\npossible, the present useful character of the domestic institution, wherein\r\nthose too old and too young to work are provided for with care and humanity\r\nand those capable of labor are not overtasked, would undergo an unfortunate\r\nchange. The feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now\r\nexists between master and slave would be converted into mutual distrust and\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nBut we are obliged as a Christian and moral nation to consider what would\r\nbe the effect upon unhappy Africa itself if we should reopen the slave\r\ntrade. This would give the trade an impulse and extension which it has\r\nnever had, even in its palmiest days. The numerous victims required to\r\nsupply it would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect pandemonium,\r\nfor which this country would be held responsible in the eyes both of God\r\nand man. Its petty tribes would then be constantly engaged in predatory\r\nwars against each other for the purpose of seizing slaves to supply the\r\nAmerican market. All hopes of African civilization would thus be ended.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when a market for African slaves shall no longer be\r\nfurnished in Cuba, and thus all the world be closed against this trade, we\r\nmay then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of Africa.\r\nThe chief motive of war among the tribes will cease whenever there is no\r\nlonger any demand for slaves. The resources of that fertile but miserable\r\ncountry might then be developed by the hand of industry and afford subjects\r\nfor legitimate foreign and domestic commerce. In this manner Christianity\r\nand civilization may gradually penetrate the existing gloom.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the course pursued by this Government toward China has been\r\nvindicated by the event. Whilst we sustained a neutral position in the war\r\nwaged by Great Britain and France against the Chinese Empire, our late\r\nminister, in obedience to his instructions, judiciously cooperated with the\r\nministers of these powers in all peaceful measures to secure by treaty the\r\njust concessions demanded by the interests of foreign commerce. The result\r\nis that satisfactory treaties have been concluded with China by the\r\nrespective ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, and\r\nRussia. Our \"treaty, or general convention, of peace, amity, and commerce\"\r\nwith that Empire was concluded at Tien-tsin on the 18th June, 1858, and was\r\nratified by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, on the 21st December following. On the 15th December, 1858, John E.\r\nWard, a distinguished citizen of Georgia, was duly commissioned as envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to China.\r\n\r\nHe left the United States for the place of his destination on the 5th of\r\nFebruary, 1859, bearing with him the ratified copy of this treaty, and\r\narrived at Shanghai on the 28th May. From thence he proceeded to Peking on\r\nthe 16th June, but did not arrive in that city until the 27th July.\r\nAccording to the terms of the treaty, the ratifications were to be\r\nexchanged on or before the 18th June, 1859. This was rendered impossible by\r\nreasons and events beyond his control, not necessary to detail; but still\r\nit is due to the Chinese authorities at Shanghai to state that they always\r\nassured him no advantage should be taken of the delay, and this pledge has\r\nbeen faithfully redeemed.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Mr. Ward at Peking he requested an audience of the\r\nEmperor to present his letter of credence. This he did not obtain, in\r\nconsequence of his very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating\r\nceremonies required by the etiquette of this strange people in approaching\r\ntheir sovereign. Nevertheless, the interviews on this question were\r\nconducted in the most friendly spirit and with all due regard to his\r\npersonal feelings and the honor of his country. When a presentation to His\r\nMajesty was found to be impossible, the letter of credence from the\r\nPresident was received with peculiar honors by Kweiliang, \"the Emperor's\r\nprime minister and the second man in the Empire to the Emperor himself.\"\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty were afterwards, on the 16th of August,\r\nexchanged in proper form at Peit-sang. As the exchange did not take place\r\nuntil after the day prescribed by the treaty, it is deemed proper before\r\nits publication again to submit it to the Senate. It is but simple justice\r\nto the Chinese authorities to observe that throughout the whole transaction\r\nthey appear to have acted in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward the\r\nUnited States. It is true this has been done after their own peculiar\r\nfashion; but we ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient customs of\r\nan empire dating back for thousands of years, so far as this may be\r\nconsistent with our own national honor. The conduct of our minister on the\r\noccasion has received my entire approbation.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give it full effect\r\nit became necessary to conclude two supplemental conventions, the one for\r\nthe adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our citizens and the other\r\nto fix the tariff on imports and exports and to regulate the transit duties\r\nand trade of our merchants with China. This duty was satisfactorily\r\nperformed by our late minister. These conventions bear date at Shanghai on\r\nthe 8th November, 1858. Having been considered in the light of binding\r\nagreements subsidiary to the principal treaty, and to be carried into\r\nexecution without delay, they do not provide for any formal ratification or\r\nexchange of ratifications by the contracting parties. This was not deemed\r\nnecessary by the Chinese, who are already proceeding in good faith to\r\nsatisfy the claims of our citizens and, it is hoped, to carry out the other\r\nprovisions of the conventions. Still, I thought it was proper to submit\r\nthem to the Senate by which they were ratified on the 3d of March, 1859.\r\nThe ratified copies, however, did not reach Shanghai until after the\r\ndeparture of our minister to Peking, and these conventions could not,\r\ntherefore, be exchanged at the same time with the principal treaty. No\r\ndoubt is entertained that they will be ratified and exchanged by the\r\nChinese Government should this be thought advisable; but under the\r\ncircumstances presented I shall consider them binding engagements from\r\ntheir date on both parties, and cause them to be published as such for the\r\ninformation and guidance of our merchants trading with the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nIt affords me much satisfaction to inform you that all our difficulties\r\nwith the Republic of Paraguay have been satisfactorily adjusted. It happily\r\ndid not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose which\r\nCongress had placed at my command under the joint resolution of 2d June,\r\n1858. On the contrary, the President of that Republic, in a friendly\r\nspirit, acceded promptly to the just and reasonable demands of the\r\nGovernment of the United States. Our commissioner arrived at Assumption,\r\nthe capital of the Republic, on the 25th of January, 1859, and left it on\r\nthe 17th of February, having in three weeks ably and successfully\r\naccomplished all the objects of his mission. The treaties which he has\r\nconcluded will be immediately submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the view that the employment of other than peaceful means might become\r\nnecessary to obtain \"just satisfaction\" from Paraguay, a strong naval force\r\nwas concentrated in the waters of the La Plata to await contingencies\r\nwhilst our commissioner ascended the rivers to Assumption. The Navy\r\nDepartment is entitled to great credit for the promptness, efficiency, and\r\neconomy with which this expedition was fitted out and conducted. It\r\nconsisted of 19 armed vessels, great and small, carrying 200 guns and 2,500\r\nmen, all under the command of the veteran and gallant Shubrick. The entire\r\nexpenses of the expedition have been defrayed out of the ordinary\r\nappropriations for the naval service, except the sum of $289,000, applied\r\nto the purchase of seven of the steamers constituting a part of it, under\r\nthe authority of the naval appropriation act of the 3d March last. It is\r\nbelieved that these steamers are worth more than their cost, and they are\r\nall now usefully and actively employed in the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of so large a force, fitted out in such a prompt manner, in\r\nthe far-distant waters of the La Plata, and the admirable conduct of the\r\nofficers and men employed in it, have had a happy effect in favor of our\r\ncountry throughout all that remote portion of the world. Our relations with\r\nthe great Empires of France and Russia, as well as with all other\r\ngovernments on the continent of Europe, unless we may except that of Spain,\r\nhappily continue to be of the most friendly character. In my last annual\r\nmessage I presented a statement of the unsatisfactory condition of our\r\nrelations with Spain, and I regret to say that this has not materially\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nWithout special reference to other claims, even the \"Cuban claims,\" the\r\npayment of which has been ably urged by our ministers, and in which more\r\nthan a hundred of our citizens are directly interested, remain unsatisfied,\r\nnotwithstanding both their justice and their amount ($128,635.54) had been\r\nrecognized and ascertained by the Spanish Government itself.\r\n\r\nI again recommend that an appropriation be made \"to be paid to the Spanish\r\nGovernment for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the\r\nAmistad case.\" In common with two of my predecessors, I entertain no doubt\r\nthat this is required by our treaty with Spain of the 27th October, 1795.\r\nThe failure to discharge this obligation has been employed by the cabinet\r\nof Madrid as a reason against the settlement of our claims.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat the arguments which I urged in my last annual message in\r\nfavor of the acquisition of Cuba by fair purchase. My opinions on that\r\nmeasure remain unchanged. I therefore again invite the serious attention of\r\nCongress to this important subject. Without a recognition of this policy on\r\ntheir part it will be almost impossible to institute negotiations with any\r\nreasonable prospect of success. Until a recent period there was good reason\r\nto believe that I should be able to announce to you on the present occasion\r\nthat our difficulties with Great Britain arising out of the Clayton and\r\nBulwer treaty had been finally adjusted in a manner alike honorable and\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. From causes, however, which the British\r\nGovernment had not anticipated, they have not yet completed treaty\r\narrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of\r\nthe understanding between the two Governments. It is, nevertheless,\r\nconfidently expected that this good work will ere long be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhilst indulging the hope that no other subject remained which could\r\ndisturb the good understanding between the two countries, the question\r\narising out of the adverse claims of the parties to the island of San Juan,\r\nunder the Oregon treaty of the 15th June, 1846, suddenly assumed a\r\nthreatening prominence. In order to prevent unfortunate collisions on that\r\nremote frontier, the late Secretary of State, on the 17th July, 1855,\r\naddressed a note to Mr. Crampton, then British minister at Washington,\r\ncommunicating to him a copy of the instructions which he (Mr. Marcy) had\r\ngiven on the 14th July to Governor Stevens, of Washington Territory, having\r\na special reference to an \"apprehended conflict between our citizens and\r\nthe British subjects on the island of San Juan.\" To prevent this the\r\ngovernor was instructed \"that the officers of the Territory should abstain\r\nfrom all acts on the disputed grounds which are calculated to provoke any\r\nconflicts, so far as it can be done without implying the concession to the\r\nauthorities of Great Britain of an exclusive right over the premises. The\r\ntitle ought to be settled before either party should attempt to exclude the\r\nother by force or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign rights within\r\nthe fairly disputed limits.\" In acknowledging the receipt on the next day\r\nof Mr. Marcy's note the British minister expressed his entire concurrence\r\n\"in the propriety of the course recommended to the governor of Washington\r\nTerritory by your [Mr. Marcy's] instructions to that officer,\" and stating\r\nthat he had \"lost no time in transmitting a copy of that document to the\r\nGovernor-General of British North America\" and had \"earnestly recommended\r\nto His Excellency to take such measures as to him may appear best\r\ncalculated to secure on the part of the British local authorities and the\r\ninhabitants of the neighborhood of the line in question the exercise of the\r\nsame spirit of forbearance which is inculcated by you [Mr. Marcy] on the\r\nauthorities and citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThus matters remained upon the faith of this arrangement until the 9th July\r\nlast, when General Harney paid a visit to the island. He found upon it\r\ntwenty-five American residents with their families, and also an\r\nestablishment of the Hudsons Bay Company for the purpose of raising sheep.\r\nA short time before his arrival one of these residents had shot an animal\r\nbelonging to the company whilst trespassing upon his premises, for which,\r\nhowever, he offered to pay twice its value, but that was refused. Soon\r\nafter \"the chief factor of the company at Victoria, Mr. Dalles, son-in-law\r\nof Governor Douglas, came to the island in the British sloop of war\r\nSatellite and threatened to take this American [Mr. Cutler] by force to\r\nVictoria to answer for the trespass he had committed. The American seized\r\nhis rifle and told Mr. Dalles if any such attempt was made he would kill\r\nhim upon the spot. The affair then ended.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the American settlers presented a petition to the\r\nGeneral \"through the United States inspector of customs, Mr. Hubbs, to\r\nplace a force upon the island to protect them from the Indians as well as\r\nthe oppressive interference of the authorities of the Hudsons Bay Company\r\nat Victoria with their rights as American citizens.\" The General\r\nimmediately responded to this petition, and ordered Captain George E.\r\nPickett, Ninth Infantry, \"to establish his company on Bellevue, or San Juan\r\nIsland, on some suitable position near the harbor at the southeastern\r\nextremity.\" This order was promptly obeyed and a military post was\r\nestablished at the place designated. The force was afterwards increased, so\r\nthat by the last return the whole number of troops then on the island\r\namounted in the aggregate to 691 men.\r\n\r\nWhilst I do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go further into\r\nthe subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attached to the\r\nstatements of the British colonial authorities contesting the accuracy of\r\nthe information on which the gallant General acted, it was due to him that\r\nI should thus present his own reasons for issuing the order to Captain\r\nPickett. From these it is quite clear his object was to prevent the British\r\nauthorities on Vancouvers Island from exercising jurisdiction over American\r\nresidents on the island of San Juan, as well as to protect them against the\r\nincursions of the Indians. Much excitement prevailed for some time\r\nthroughout that region, and serious danger of collision between the parties\r\nwas apprehended. The British had a large naval force in the vicinity, and\r\nit is but an act of simple justice to the admiral on that station to state\r\nthat he wisely and discreetly forbore to commit any hostile act, but\r\ndetermined to refer the whole affair to his Government and await their\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter, in my opinion, demanded serious attention. It\r\nwould have been a great calamity for both nations had they been\r\nprecipitated into acts of hostility, not on the question of title to the\r\nisland, but merely concerning what should be its condition during the\r\nintervening period whilst the two Governments might be employed in settling\r\nthe question to which of them it belongs. For this reason\r\nLieutenant-General Scott was dispatched, on the 17th of September last, to\r\nWashington Territory to take immediate command of the United States forces\r\non the Pacific Coast, should he deem this necessary. The main object of his\r\nmission was to carry out the spirit of the precautionary arrangement\r\nbetween the late Secretary of State and the British minister, and thus to\r\npreserve the peace and prevent collision between the British and American\r\nauthorities pending the negotiations between the two Governments.\r\nEntertaining no doubt of the validity of our title, I need scarcely add\r\nthat in any event American citizens were to be placed on a footing at least\r\nas favorable as that of British subjects, it being understood that Captain\r\nPickett's company should remain on the island. It is proper to observe\r\nthat, considering the distance from the scene of action and in ignorance of\r\nwhat might have transpired on the spot before the General's arrival, it was\r\nnecessary to leave much to his discretion; and I am happy to state the\r\nevent has proven that this discretion could not have been intrusted to more\r\ncompetent hands. General Scott has recently returned from his mission,\r\nhaving successfully accomplished its objects, and there is no longer any\r\ngood reason to apprehend a collision between the forces of the two\r\ncountries during the pendency of the existing negotiations. I regret to\r\ninform you that there has been no improvement in the affairs of Mexico\r\nsince my last annual message, and I am again obliged to ask the earnest\r\nattention of Congress to the unhappy condition of that Republic.\r\n\r\nThe constituent Congress of Mexico, which adjourned on the 17th February,\r\n1857, adopted a constitution and provided for a popular election. This took\r\nplace in the following July (1857), and General Comonfort was chosen\r\nPresident almost without opposition. At the same election a new Congress\r\nwas chosen, whose first session commenced on the 16th of September (1857).\r\nBy the constitution of 1857 the Presidential term was to begin on the 1st\r\nof December (1857) and continue for four years. On that day General\r\nComonfort appeared before the assembled Congress in the City of Mexico,\r\ntook the oath to support the new constitution, and was duly inaugurated as\r\nPresident. Within a month afterwards he had been driven from the capital\r\nand a military rebellion had assigned the supreme power of the Republic to\r\nGeneral Zuloaga. The constitution provided that in the absence of the\r\nPresident his office should devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme\r\ncourt; and General Comonfort having left the country, this functionary,\r\nGeneral Juarez, proceeded to form at Guanajuato a constitutional\r\nGovernment. Before this was officially known, however, at the capital the\r\nGovernment of Zuloaga had been recognized by the entire diplomatic corps,\r\nincluding the minister of the United States, as the de facto Government of\r\nMexico. The constitutional President, nevertheless, maintained his position\r\nwith firmness, and was soon established, with his cabinet, at Vera Cruz.\r\nMeanwhile the Government of Zuloaga was earnestly resisted in many parts of\r\nthe Republic, and even in the capital, a portion of the army having\r\npronounced against it, its functions were declared terminated, and an\r\nassembly of citizens was invited for the choice of a new President. This\r\nassembly elected General Miramort, but that officer repudiated the plan\r\nunder which he was chosen, and Zuloaga was thus restored to his previous\r\nposition. He assumed it, however, only to withdraw from it; and Miramon,\r\nhaving become by his appointment \"President substitute,\" continues with\r\nthat title at the head of the insurgent party.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I communicated to Congress the circumstances\r\nunder which the late minister of the United States suspended his official\r\nrelations with the central Government and withdrew from the country. It was\r\nimpossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a government like that at\r\nthe capital, under whose usurped authority wrongs were constantly\r\ncommitted, but never redressed. Had this been an established government,\r\nwith its power extending by the consent of the people over the whole of\r\nMexico, a resort to hostilities against it would have been quite\r\njustifiable, and, indeed, necessary. But the country was a prey to civil\r\nwar, and it was hoped that the success of the constitutional President\r\nmight lead to a condition of things less injurious to the United States.\r\nThis success became so probable that in January last I employed a reliable\r\nagent to visit Mexico and report to me the actual condition and prospects\r\nof the contending parties. In consequence of his report and from\r\ninformation which reached me from other sources favorable to the prospects\r\nof the constitutional cause, I felt justified in appointing a new minister\r\nto Mexico, who might embrace the earliest suitable opportunity of restoring\r\nour diplomatic relations with that Republic. For this purpose a\r\ndistinguished citizen of Maryland was selected, who proceeded on his\r\nmission on the 8th of March last, with discretionary authority to recognize\r\nthe Government of President Juarez if on his arrival in Mexico he should\r\nfind it entitled to such recognition according to the established practice\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April following Mr. McLane presented his credentials to\r\nPresident Juarez, having no hesitation \"in pronouncing the Government of\r\nJuarez to be the only existing government of the Republic.\" He was\r\ncordially received by the authorities at Vera Cruz, and they have ever\r\nsince manifested the most friendly disposition toward the United States.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, however, the constitutional Government has not been able to\r\nestablish its power over the whole Republic. It is supported by a large\r\nmajority of the people and the States, but there are important parts of the\r\ncountry where it can enforce no obedience.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miramon maintains himself at the capital, and in some of the\r\ndistant Provinces there are military governors who pay little respect to\r\nthe decrees of either Government. In the meantime the excesses which always\r\nattend upon civil war, especially in Mexico, are constantly recurring.\r\nOutrages of the worst description are committed both upon persons and\r\nproperty. There is scarcely any form of injury which has not been suffered\r\nby our citizens in Mexico during the last few years. We have been nominally\r\nat peace with that Republic, but \"so far as the interests of our commerce,\r\nor of our citizens who have visited the country as merchants, shipmasters,\r\nor in other capacities, are concerned, we might as well have been at war.\"\r\nLife has been insecure, property unprotected, and trade impossible except\r\nat a risk of loss which prudent men can not be expected to incur. Important\r\ncontracts, involving large expenditures, entered into by the central\r\nGovernment, have been set at defiance by the local governments. Peaceful\r\nAmerican residents, occupying their rightful possessions, have been\r\nsuddenly expelled the country, in defiance of treaties and by the mere\r\nforce of arbitrary power. Even the course of justice has not been safe from\r\ncontrol, and a recent decree of Miramort permits the intervention of\r\nGovernment in all suits where either party is a foreigner. Vessels of the\r\nUnited States have been seized without law, and a consular officer who\r\nprotested against such seizure has been fined and imprisoned for disrespect\r\nto the authorities. Military contributions have been levied in violation of\r\nevery principle of right, and the American who resisted the lawless demand\r\nhas had his property forcibly taken away and has been himself banished.\r\nFrom a conflict of authority in different parts of the country tariff\r\nduties which have been paid in one place have been exacted over again in\r\nanother place. Large numbers of our citizens have been arrested and\r\nimprisoned without any form of examination or any opportunity for a\r\nhearing, and even when released have only obtained their liberty after much\r\nsuffering and injury, and without any hope of redress. The wholesale\r\nmassacre of Crabbe and his associates without trial in Sonora, as well as\r\nthe seizure and murder of four sick Americans who had taken shelter in the\r\nhouse of an American upon the soil of the United States, was communicated\r\nto Congress at its last session. Murders of a still more atrocious\r\ncharacter have been committed in the very heart of Mexico, under the\r\nauthority of Miramon's Government, during the present year. Some of these\r\nwere only worthy of a barbarous age, and if they had not been dearly proven\r\nwould have seemed impossible in a country which claims to be civilized. Of\r\nthis description was the brutal massacre in April last, by order of General\r\nMarquez, of three American physicians who were seized in the hospital at\r\nTacubaya while attending upon the sick and the dying of both parties, and\r\nwithout trial, as without crime, were hurried away to speedy execution.\r\nLittle less shocking was the recent fate of Ormond Chase, who was shot in\r\nTepic on the 7th of August by order of the same Mexican general, not only\r\nwithout a trial, but without any conjecture by his friends of the cause of\r\nhis arrest. He is represented as a young man of good character and\r\nintelligence, who had made numerous friends in Tepic by the courage and\r\nhumanity which he had displayed on several trying occasions; and his death\r\nwas as unexpected as it was shocking to the whole community. Other outrages\r\nmight be enumerated, but these are sufficient to illustrate the wretched\r\nstate of the country and the unprotected condition of the persons and\r\nproperty of our citizens in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases our ministers have been constant and faithful in their\r\ndemands for redress, but both they and this Government, which they have\r\nsuccessively represented, have been wholly powerless to make their demands\r\neffective. Their testimony in this respect and in reference to the only\r\nremedy which in their judgments would meet the exigency has been both\r\nuniform and emphatic. \"Nothing but a manifestation of the power of the\r\nGovernment of the United States,\" wrote our late minister in 1856, \"and of\r\nits purpose to punish these wrongs will avail. I assure you that the\r\nuniversal belief here is that there is nothing to be apprehended from the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and that local Mexican officials can\r\ncommit these outrages upon American citizens with absolute impunity.\" \"I\r\nhope the President,\" wrote our present minister in August last, \"will feel\r\nauthorized to ask from Congress the power to enter Mexico with the military\r\nforces of the United States at the call of the constitutional authorities,\r\nin order to protect the citizens and the treaty rights of the United\r\nStates. Unless such a power is conferred upon him, neither the one nor the\r\nother will be respected in the existing state of anarchy and disorder, and\r\nthe outrages already perpetrated will never be chastised; and, as I assured\r\nyou in my No. 23, all these evils must increase until every vestige of\r\norder and government disappears from the country.\" I have been reluctantly\r\nled to the same opinion, and in justice to my countrymen who have suffered\r\nwrongs from Mexico and who may still suffer them I feel bound to announce\r\nthis conclusion to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe case presented, however, is not merely a case of individual claims,\r\nalthough our just claims against Mexico have reached a very large amount;\r\nnor is it merely the case of protection to the lives and property of the\r\nfew Americans who may still remain in Mexico, although the life and\r\nproperty of every American citizen ought to be sacredly protected in every\r\nquarter of the world; but it is a question which relates to the future as\r\nwell as to the present and the past, and which involves, indirectly at\r\nleast, the whole subject of our duty to Mexico as a neighboring State. The\r\nexercise of the power of the United States in that country to redress the\r\nwrongs and protect the rights of our own citizens is none the less to be\r\ndesired because efficient and necessary aid may thus be rendered at the\r\nsame time to restore peace and order to Mexico itself. In the\r\naccomplishment of this result the people of the United States must\r\nnecessarily feel a deep and earnest interest. Mexico ought to be a rich and\r\nprosperous and powerful Republic. She possesses an extensive territory, a\r\nfertile soil, and an incalculable store of mineral wealth. She occupies an\r\nimportant position between the Gulf and the ocean for transit routes and\r\nfor commerce. Is it possible that such a country as this can be given up to\r\nanarchy and ruin without an effort from any quarter for its rescue and its\r\nsafety? Will the commercial nations of the world, which have so many\r\ninterests connected with it, remain wholly indifferent to such a result?\r\nCan the United States especially, which ought to share most largely in its\r\ncommercial intercourse, allow their immediate neighbor thus to destroy\r\nitself and injure them? Yet without support from some quarter it is\r\nimpossible to perceive how Mexico can resume her position among nations and\r\nenter upon a career which promises any good results. The aid which she\r\nrequires, and which the interests of all commercial countries require that\r\nshe should have, it belongs to this Government to render, not only by\r\nvirtue of our neighborhood to Mexico, along whose territory we have a\r\ncontinuous frontier of nearly a thousand miles, but by virtue also of our\r\nestablished policy, which is inconsistent with the intervention of any\r\nEuropean power in the domestic concerns of that Republic.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico are before the world and must\r\ndeeply impress every American citizen. A government which is either unable\r\nor unwilling to redress such wrongs is derelict to its highest duties. The\r\ndifficulty consists in selecting and enforcing the remedy. We may in vain\r\napply to the constitutional Government at Vera Cruz, although it is well\r\ndisposed to do us justice, for adequate redress. Whilst its authority is\r\nacknowledged in all the important ports and throughout the seacoasts of the\r\nRepublic, its power does not extend to the City of Mexico and the States in\r\nits vicinity, where nearly all the recent outrages have been committed on\r\nAmerican citizens. We must penetrate into the interior before we can reach\r\nthe offenders, and this can only be done by passing through the territory\r\nin the occupation of the constitutional Government. The most acceptable and\r\nleast difficult mode of accomplishing the object will be to act in concert\r\nwith that Government. Their consent and their aid might, I believe, be\r\nobtained; but if not, our obligation to protect our own citizens in their\r\njust rights secured by treaty would not be the less imperative. For these\r\nreasons I recommend to Congress to pass a law authorizing the President\r\nunder such conditions as they may deem expedient, to employ a sufficient\r\nmilitary force to enter Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnity for\r\nthe past and security for the future. I purposely refrain from any\r\nsuggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troops or\r\nvolunteers, or both. This question may be most appropriately left to the\r\ndecision of Congress. I would merely observe that should volunteers be\r\nselected such a force could be easily raised in this country among those\r\nwho sympathize with the sufferings of our unfortunate fellow-citizens in\r\nMexico and with the unhappy condition of that Republic. Such an accession\r\nto the forces of the constitutional Government would enable it soon to\r\nreach the City of Mexico and extend its power over the whole Republic. In\r\nthat event there is no reason to doubt that the just claims of our citizens\r\nwould be satisfied and adequate redress obtained for the injuries inflicted\r\nupon them. The constitutional Government have ever evinced a strong desire\r\nto do justice, and this might be secured in advance by a preliminary\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that these measures will, at least indirectly, be\r\ninconsistent with our wise and settled policy not to interfere in the\r\ndomestic concerns of foreign nations. But does not the present case fairly\r\nconstitute an exception? An adjoining Republic is in a state of anarchy and\r\nconfusion from which she has proved wholly unable to extricate herself. She\r\nis entirely destitute of the power to maintain peace upon her borders or to\r\nprevent the incursions of banditti into our territory. In her fate and in\r\nher fortune, in her power to establish and maintain a settled government,\r\nwe have a far deeper interest, socially, commercially, and politically,\r\nthan any other nation. She is now a wreck upon the ocean, drifting about as\r\nshe is impelled by different factions. As a good neighbor, shall we not\r\nextend to her a helping hand to save her? If we do not, it would not be\r\nsurprising should some other nation undertake the task, and thus force us\r\nto interfere at last, under circumstances of increased difficulty, for the\r\nmaintenance of our established policy.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message that\r\nauthority may be given to the President to establish one or more temporary\r\nmilitary posts across the Mexican line in Sonora and Chihuahua, where these\r\nmay be necessary to protect the lives and property of American and Mexican\r\ncitizens against the incursions and depredations of the Indians, as well as\r\nof lawless rovers, on that remote region. The establishment of one such\r\npost at a point called Arispe, in Sonora, in a country now almost\r\ndepopulated by the hostile inroads of the Indians from our side of the\r\nline, would, it is believed, have prevented much injury and many cruelties\r\nduring the past season. A state of lawlessness and violence prevails on\r\nthat distant frontier. Life and property are there wholly insecure. The\r\npopulation of Arizona, now numbering more than 10,000 souls, are\r\npractically destitute of government, of laws, or of any regular\r\nadministration of justice. Murder, rapine, and other crimes are committed\r\nwith impunity. I therefore again call the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity for establishing a Territorial government over Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Nicaragua of the 16th of February, 1857, to which I\r\nreferred in my last annual message, failed to receive the ratification of\r\nthe Government of that Republic, for reasons which I need not enumerate. A\r\nsimilar treaty has been since concluded between the parties, bearing date\r\non the 16th March, 1859, which has already been ratified by the Nicaraguan\r\nCongress. This will be immediately submitted to the Senate for their\r\nratification. Its provisions can not, I think, fail to be acceptable to the\r\npeople of both countries.\r\n\r\nOur claims against the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua remain\r\nunredressed, though they are pressed in an earnest manner and not without\r\nhope of success.\r\n\r\nI deem it to be my duty once more earnestly to recommend to Congress the\r\npassage of a law authorizing the President to employ the naval force at his\r\ncommand for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of American\r\ncitizens passing in transit across the Panama, Nicaragua, and Tehuantepec\r\nroutes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations. I shall not\r\nrepeat the arguments employed in former messages in support of this\r\nmeasure. Suffice it to say that the lives of many of our people and the\r\nsecurity of vast amounts of treasure passing and repassing over one or more\r\nof these routes between the Atlantic and Pacific may be deeply involved in\r\nthe action of Congress on this subject.\r\n\r\nI would also again recommend to Congress that authority be given to the\r\nPresident to employ the naval force to protect American merchant vessels,\r\ntheir crews and cargoes, against violent and lawless seizure and\r\nconfiscation in the ports of Mexico and the Spanish American States when\r\nthese countries may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition. The mere\r\nknowledge that such an authority had been conferred, as I have already\r\nstated, would of itself in a great degree prevent the evil. Neither would\r\nthis require any additional appropriation for the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection urged against the grant of this authority is that\r\nCongress by conferring it would violate the Constitution; that it would be\r\na transfer of the war-making, or, strictly speaking, the war-declaring,\r\npower to the Executive. If this were well rounded, it would, of course, be\r\nconclusive. A very brief examination, however, will place this objection at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nCongress possess the sole and exclusive power under the Constitution \"to\r\ndeclare war.\" They alone can \"raise and support armies\" and \"provide and\r\nmaintain a navy.\" But after Congress shall have declared war and provided\r\nthe force necessary to carry it on the President, as Commander in Chief of\r\nthe Army and Navy, can alone employ this force in making war against the\r\nenemy. This is the plain language, and history proves that it was the\r\nwell-known intention of the framers, of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied that the general \"power to declare war\" is without\r\nlimitation and embraces within itself not only what writers on the law of\r\nnations term a public or perfect war, but also an imperfect war, and, in\r\nshort, every species of hostility, however confined or limited. Without the\r\nauthority of Congress the President can not fire a hostile gun in any case\r\nexcept to repel the attacks of an enemy. It will not be doubted that under\r\nthis power Congress could, if they thought proper, authorize the President\r\nto employ the force at his command to seize a vessel belonging to an\r\nAmerican citizen which had been illegally and unjustly captured in a\r\nforeign port and restore it to its owner. But can Congress only act after\r\nthe fact, after the mischief has been done? Have they no power to confer\r\nupon the President the authority in advance to furnish instant redress\r\nshould such a case afterwards occur? Must they wait until the mischief has\r\nbeen done, and can they apply the remedy only when it is too late? To\r\nconfer this authority to meet future cases under circumstances strictly\r\nspecified is as clearly within the war-declaring power as such an authority\r\nconferred upon the President by act of Congress after the deed had been\r\ndone. In the progress of a great nation many exigencies must arise\r\nimperatively requiring that Congress should authorize the President to act\r\npromptly on certain conditions which may or may not afterwards arise. Our\r\nhistory has already presented a number of such cases. I shall refer only to\r\nthe latest. Under the resolution of June 2, 1858, \"for the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties with the Republic of Paraguay,\" the President is \"authorized\r\nto adopt such measures and use such force as in his judgment may be\r\nnecessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of just satisfaction by\r\nthe Government of Paraguay.\" \"Just satisfaction\" for what? For \"the attack\r\non the United States steamer Water Witch\" and \"other matters referred to in\r\nthe annual message of the President.\" Here the power is expressly granted\r\nupon the condition that the Government of Paraguay shall refuse to render\r\nthis \"just satisfaction.\" In this and other similar cases Congress have\r\nconferred upon the President power in advance to employ the Army and Navy\r\nupon the happening of contingent future events; and this most certainly is\r\nembraced within the power to declare war.\r\n\r\nNow, if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally\r\nconferred upon the President in the case of Paraguay, why may it not be\r\nconferred for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of American\r\ncitizens in the event that they may be violently and unlawfully attacked in\r\npassing over the transit routes to and from California or assailed by the\r\nseizure of their vessels in a foreign port? To deny this power is to render\r\nthe Navy in a great degree useless for the protection of the lives and\r\nproperty of American citizens in countries where neither protection nor\r\nredress can be otherwise obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-fifth Congress terminated on the 3d of March, 1859, without\r\nhaving passed the \"act making appropriations for the service of the\r\nPost-Office Department during the fiscal year ending the 30th of June,\r\n1860,\" This act also contained an appropriation \"to supply deficiencies in\r\nthe revenue of the Post-Office Department for the year ending 30th June,\r\n1859.\" I believe this is the first instance since the origin of the Federal\r\nGovernment, now more than seventy years ago, when any Congress went out of\r\nexistence without having passed all the general appropriation bills\r\nnecessary to carry on the Government until the regular period for the\r\nmeeting of a new Congress. This event imposed on the Executive a grave\r\nresponsibility. It presented a choice of evils.\r\n\r\nHad this omission of duty occurred at the first session of the last\r\nCongress, the remedy would have been plain. I might then have instantly\r\nrecalled them to complete their work, and this without expense to the\r\nGovernment. But on the 4th of March last there were fifteen of the\r\nthirty-three States which had not elected any Representatives to the\r\npresent Congress. Had Congress been called together immediately, these\r\nStates would have been virtually disfranchised. If an intermediate period\r\nhad been selected, several of the States would have been compelled to hold\r\nextra sessions of their legislatures, at great inconvenience and expense,\r\nto provide for elections at an earlier day than that previously fixed by\r\nlaw. In the regular course ten of these States would not elect until after\r\nthe beginning of August, and five of these ten not until October and\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I came to examine carefully the condition of the\r\nPost-Office Department, I did not meet as many or as great difficulties as\r\nI had apprehended. Had the bill which failed been confined to\r\nappropriations for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June next, there\r\nwould have been no reason of pressing importance for the call of an extra\r\nsession. Nothing would become due on contracts (those with railroad\r\ncompanies only excepted) for carrying the mail for the first quarter of the\r\npresent fiscal year, commencing on the 1st of July, until the 1st of\r\nDecember--less than one week before the meeting of the present Congress.\r\nThe reason is that the mail contractors for this and the current year did\r\nnot complete their first quarter's service until the 30th September last,\r\nand by the terms of their contracts sixty days more are allowed for the\r\nsettlement of their accounts before the Department could be called upon for\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty and the great hardship consisted in the failure to\r\nprovide for the payment of the deficiency in the fiscal year ending the\r\n30th June, 1859. The Department had entered into contracts, in obedience to\r\nexisting laws, for the service of that fiscal year, and the contractors\r\nwere fairly entitled to their compensation as it became due. The deficiency\r\nas stated in the bill amounted to $3,838,728, but after a careful\r\nsettlement of all these accounts it has been ascertained that it amounts to\r\n$4,296,009. With the scanty means at his command the Postmaster-General has\r\nmanaged to pay that portion of this deficiency which occurred in the first\r\ntwo quarters of the past fiscal year, ending on the 31st December last. In\r\nthe meantime the contractors themselves, under these trying circumstances,\r\nhave behaved in a manner worthy of all commendation. They had one resource\r\nin the midst of their embarrassments. After the amount due to each of them\r\nhad been ascertained and finally settled according to law, this became a\r\nspecific debt of record against the United States, which enabled them to\r\nborrow money on this unquestionable security. Still, they were obliged to\r\npay interest in consequence of the default of Congress, and on every\r\nprinciple of justice ought to receive interest from the Government. This\r\ninterest should commence from the date when a warrant would have issued for\r\nthe payment of the principal had an appropriation been made for this\r\npurpose. Calculated up to the 1st December, it will not exceed $96,660--a\r\nsum not to be taken into account when contrasted with the great\r\ndifficulties and embarrassments of a public and private character, both to\r\nthe people and the States, which would have resulted from convening and\r\nholding a special session of Congress. For these reasons I recommend the\r\npassage of a bill at as early a day as may be practicable to provide for\r\nthe payment of the amount, with interest, due to these last-mentioned\r\ncontractors, as well as to make the necessary appropriations for the\r\nservice of the Post-Office Department for the current fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe failure to pass the Post-Office bill necessarily gives birth to serious\r\nreflections. Congress, by refusing to pass the general appropriation bills\r\nnecessary to carry on the Government, may not only arrest its action, but\r\nmight even destroy its existence. The Army, the Navy, the judiciary, in\r\nshort, every department of the Government, can no longer perform their\r\nfunctions if Congress refuse the money necessary for their support. If this\r\nfailure should teach the country the necessity of electing a full Congress\r\nin sufficient time to enable the President to convene them in any\r\nemergency, even immediately after the old Congress has expired, it will\r\nhave been productive of great good. In a time of sudden and alarming\r\ndanger, foreign or domestic, which all nations must expect to encounter in\r\ntheir progress, the very salvation of our institutions may be staked upon\r\nthe assembling of Congress without delay. If under such circumstances the\r\nPresident should find himself in the condition in which he was placed at\r\nthe close of the last Congress, with nearly half the States of the Union\r\ndestitute of representatives, the consequences might he disastrous. I\r\ntherefore recommend to Congress to carry into effect the provisions of the\r\nConstitution on this subject, and to pass a law appointing some day\r\nprevious to the 4th March in each year of odd number for the election of\r\nRepresentatives throughout all the States. They have already appointed a\r\nday for the election of electors for President and Vice-President, and this\r\nmeasure has been approved by the country.\r\n\r\nI would again express a most decided opinion in favor of the construction\r\nof a Pacific railroad, for the reasons stated in my two last annual\r\nmessages. When I reflect upon what would be the defenseless condition of\r\nour States and Territories west of the Rocky Mountains in case of a war\r\nwith a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all intercourse with\r\nthem by the routes across the Isthmus, I am still more convinced than ever\r\nof the vast importance of this railroad. I have never doubted the\r\nconstitutional competency of Congress to provide for its construction, but\r\nthis exclusively under the war-making power. Besides, the Constitution\r\nexpressly requires as an imperative duty that \"the United States shall\r\nprotect each of them [the States] against invasion.\" I am at a loss to\r\nconceive how this protection can be afforded to California and Oregon\r\nagainst such a naval power by any other means. I repeat the opinion\r\ncontained in my last annual message that it would be inexpedient for the\r\nGovernment to undertake this great work by agents of its own appointment\r\nand under its direct and exclusive control. This would increase the\r\npatronage of the Executive to a dangerous extent and would foster a system\r\nof jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of Federal\r\nofficials could prevent. The construction of this road ought, therefore, to\r\nbe intrusted to incorporated companies or other agencies who would exercise\r\nthat active and vigilant supervision over it which can be inspired alone by\r\na sense of corporate and individual interest. I venture to assert that the\r\nadditional cost of transporting troops, munitions of war, and necessary\r\nsupplies for the Army across the vast intervening plains to our possessions\r\non the Pacific Coast would be greater in such a war than the whole amount\r\nrequired to construct the road. And yet this resort would after all be\r\ninadequate for their defense and protection.\r\n\r\nWe have yet scarcely recovered from the habits of extravagant expenditure\r\nproduced by our overflowing Treasury during several years prior to the\r\ncommencement of my Administration. The financial reverses which we have\r\nsince experienced ought to teach us all to scrutinize our expenditures with\r\nthe greatest vigilance and to reduce them to the lowest possible point. The\r\nExecutive Departments of the Government have devoted themselves to the\r\naccomplishment of this object with considerable success, as will appear\r\nfrom their different reports and estimates. To these I invite the scrutiny\r\nof Congress, for the purpose of reducing them still lower, if this be\r\npracticable consistent with the great public interests of the country. In\r\naid of the policy of retrenchment, I pledge myself to examine closely the\r\nbills appropriating lands or money, so that if any of these should\r\ninadvertently pass both Houses, as must sometimes be the case, I may afford\r\nthem an opportunity for reconsideration. At the same time, we ought never\r\nto forget that true public economy consists not in withholding the means\r\nnecessary to accomplish important national objects confided to us by the\r\nConstitution, but in taking care that the money appropriated for these\r\npurposes shall be faithfully and frugally expended.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that it is\r\nextremely doubtful, to say the least, whether we shall be able to pass\r\nthrough the present and the next fiscal year without providing additional\r\nrevenue. This can only be accomplished by strictly confining the\r\nappropriations within the estimates of the different Departments, without\r\nmaking an allowance for any additional expenditures which Congress may\r\nthink proper, in their discretion, to authorize, and without providing for\r\nthe redemption of any portion of the $20,000,000 of Treasury notes which\r\nhave been already issued. In the event of a deficiency, which I consider\r\nprobable, this ought never to be supplied by a resort to additional loans.\r\nIt would be a ruinous practice in the days of peace and prosperity to go on\r\nincreasing the national debt to meet the ordinary expenses of the\r\nGovernment. This policy would cripple our resources and impair our credit\r\nin case the existence of war should render it necessary to borrow money.\r\nShould such a deficiency occur as I apprehend, I would recommend that the\r\nnecessary revenue be raised by an increase of our present duties on\r\nimports. I need not repeat the opinions expressed in my last annual message\r\nas to the best mode and manner of accomplishing this object, and shall now\r\nmerely observe that these have since undergone no change. The report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the operations of that\r\nDepartment of the Government. The receipts into the Treasury from all\r\nsources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859, including the loan\r\nauthorized by the act of June 14, 1858, and the issues of Treasury notes\r\nauthorized by existing laws, were $81,692,471.01, which sum, with the\r\nbalance of $6,398,316.10 remaining in the Treasury at the commencement of\r\nthat fiscal year, made an aggregate for the service of the year of\r\n$88,090,787.11.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859,\r\namounted to $83,751,511.57. Of this sum $17,405,285.44 were applied to the\r\npayment of interest on the public debt and the redemption of the issues of\r\nTreasury notes. The expenditures for all other branches of the public\r\nservice during that fiscal year were therefore $66,346,226.13. The balance\r\nremaining in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, being the commencement of\r\nthe present fiscal year, was $4,339,275.54. The receipts into the Treasury\r\nduring the first quarter of the present fiscal year, commencing July 1,\r\n1859, were $20,618,865.85. Of this amount $3,821,300 was received on\r\naccount of the loan and the issue of Treasury notes, the amount of\r\n$16,797,565.85 having been received during the quarter from the ordinary\r\nsources of public revenue. The estimated receipts for the remaining three\r\nquarters of the present fiscal year, to June 30, 1860, are $50,426,400. Of\r\nthis amount it is estimated that $5,756,400 will be received for Treasury\r\nnotes which may be reissued under the fifth section of the act of 3d March\r\nlast, and $1,170,000 on account of the loan authorized by the act of June\r\n14, 1858, making $6,926,400 from these extraordinary sources, and\r\n$43,500,000 from the ordinary sources of the public revenue, making an\r\naggregate, with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, of\r\n$75,384,541.89 for the estimated means of the present fiscal year, ending\r\nJune 30, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year were\r\n$20,007,174.76. Four million six hundred and sixty-four thousand three\r\nhundred and sixty-six dollars and seventy-six cents of this sum were\r\napplied to the payment of interest on the public debt and the redemption of\r\nthe issues of Treasury notes, and the remainder, being $15,342,808, were\r\napplied to ordinary expenditures during the quarter. The estimated\r\nexpenditures during the remaining three quarters, to June 30, 1860, are\r\n$40,995,558.23, of which sum $2,886,621.34 are estimated for the interest\r\non the public debt. The ascertained and estimated expenditures for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1860, on account of the public debt are\r\naccordingly $7,550,988.10, and for the ordinary expenditures of the\r\nGovernment $53,451,744.89, making an aggregate of $61,002,732.99, leaving\r\nan estimated balance in the Treasury on June 30, 1860, of $14,381,808.40.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1861,\r\nare $66,225,000, which, with the balance estimated, as before stated, as\r\nremaining in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1860, will make an aggregate\r\nfor the service of the next fiscal year of $80,606,808.40.\r\n\r\nThe estimated expenditures during the next fiscal year, ending 30th June,\r\n1861, are $66,714,928.79. Of this amount $3,386,621.34 will be required to\r\npay the interest on the public debt, leaving the sum of $63,328,307.45 for\r\nthe estimated ordinary expenditures during the fiscal year ending 30th\r\nJune, 1861. Upon these estimates a balance will be left in the Treasury on\r\nthe 30th June, 1861, of $13,891,879.61. But this balance, as well as that\r\nestimated to remain in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1860, will be reduced\r\nby such appropriations as shall be made by law to carry into effect certain\r\nIndian treaties during the present fiscal year, asked for by the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, to the amount of $539,350; and upon the estimates of the\r\npostmaster-General for the service of his Department the last fiscal year,\r\nending 30th June, 1859, amounting to $4,296,009, together with the further\r\nestimate of that officer for the service of the present fiscal year, ending\r\n30th June, 1860, being $5,526,324, making an aggregate of $10,361,683.\r\n\r\nShould these appropriations be made as requested by the proper Departments,\r\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1861, will not, it is\r\nestimated, exceed $3,530,196.61.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of\r\nthe Interior, and of the postmaster-General. They each contain valuable\r\ninformation and important recommendations well worthy of the serious\r\nconsideration of Congress. It will appear from the report of the Secretary\r\nof War that the Army expenditures have been materially reduced by a system\r\nof rigid economy, which in his opinion offers every guaranty that the\r\nreduction will be permanent. The estimates of the Department for the next\r\nhave been reduced nearly $2,000,000 below the estimates for the present\r\nfiscal year and $500,000 below the amount granted for this year at the last\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Post-Office Department during the past fiscal year,\r\nending on the 30th June, 1859, exclusive of payments for mail service\r\nspecially provided for by Congress out of the general Treasury, amounted to\r\n$14,964,493.33 and its receipts to $7,968,484.07, showing a deficiency to\r\nbe supplied from the Treasury of $6,996,009.26, against $5,235,677.15 for\r\nthe year ending 30th June, 1858. The increased cost of transportation,\r\ngrowing out of the expansion of the service required by Congress, explains\r\nthis rapid augmentation of the expenditures. It is gratifying, however, to\r\nobserve an increase of receipts for the year ending on the 30th of June,\r\n1859, equal to $481,691.21 compared with those in the year ending on the\r\n30th June, 1858.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the deficiency for the current fiscal year will be\r\n$5,988,424.04, but that for the year ending 30th June, 1861, it will not\r\nexceed $1,342,473.90 should Congress adopt the measures of reform proposed\r\nand urged by the Postmaster-General. Since the month of March retrenchments\r\nhave been made in the expenditures amounting to $1,826,471 annually, which,\r\nhowever, did not take effect until after the commencement of the present\r\nfiscal year. The period seems to have arrived for determining the question\r\nwhether this Department shall become a permanent and ever-increasing charge\r\nupon the Treasury, or shall be permitted to resume the self-sustaining\r\npolicy which had so long controlled its administration. The course of\r\nlegislation recommended by the Postmaster-General for the relief of the\r\nDepartment from its present embarrassments and for restoring it to its\r\noriginal independence is deserving of your early and earnest\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would again commend to the just liberality of Congress the\r\nlocal interests of the District of Columbia. Surely the city bearing the\r\nname of Washington, and destined, I trust, for ages to be the capital of\r\nour united, free, and prosperous Confederacy, has strong claims on our\r\nfavorable regard.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Buchanan\r\nDecember 3, 1860\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThroughout the year since our last meeting the country has been eminently\r\nprosperous in all its material interests. The general health has been\r\nexcellent, our harvests have been abundant, and plenty smiles throughout\r\nthe laud. Our commerce and manufactures have been prosecuted with energy\r\nand industry, and have yielded fair and ample returns. In short, no nation\r\nin the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of greater material\r\nprosperity than we have done until within a very recent period.\r\n\r\nWhy is it, then, that discontent now so extensively prevails, and the Union\r\nof the States, which is the source of all these blessings, is threatened\r\nwith destruction?\r\n\r\nThe long-continued and intemperate interference of the Northern people with\r\nthe question of slavery in the Southern States has at length produced its\r\nnatural effects. The different sections of the Union are now arrayed\r\nagainst each other, and the time has arrived, so much dreaded by the Father\r\nof his Country, when hostile geographical parties have been formed.\r\n\r\nI have long foreseen and often forewarned my countrymen of the now\r\nimpending danger. This does not proceed solely from the claim on the part\r\nof Congress or the Territorial legislatures to exclude slavery from the\r\nTerritories, nor from the efforts of different States to defeat the\r\nexecution of the fugitive-slave law. All or any of these evils might have\r\nbeen endured by the South without danger to the Union (as others have been)\r\nin the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy. The immediate\r\nperil arises not so much from these causes as from the fact that the\r\nincessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the\r\nNorth for the last quarter of a century has at length produced its malign\r\ninfluence on the slaves and inspired them with vague notions of freedom.\r\nHence a sense of security no longer exists around the family altar. This\r\nfeeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile\r\ninsurrections. Many a matron throughout the South retires at night in dread\r\nof what may befall herself and children before the morning. Should this\r\napprehension of domestic danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and\r\nintensify itself until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern people,\r\nthen disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation is the first law of\r\nnature, and has been implanted in the heart of man by his Creator for the\r\nwisest purpose; and no political union, however fraught with blessings and\r\nbenefits in all other respects, can long continue if the necessary\r\nconsequence be to render the homes and the firesides of nearly half the\r\nparties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds\r\nof such a union must be severed. It is my conviction that this fatal period\r\nhas not yet arrived, and my prayer to God is that He would preserve the\r\nConstitution and the Union throughout all generations.\r\n\r\nBut let us take warning in time and remove the cause of danger. It can not\r\nbe denied that for five and twenty years the agitation at the North against\r\nslavery has been incessant. In 1835 pictorial handbills and inflammatory\r\nappeals were circulated extensively throughout the South of a character to\r\nexcite the passions of the slaves, and, in the language of General Jackson,\r\n\"to stimulate them to insurrection and produce all the horrors of a servile\r\nwar.\" This agitation has ever since been continued by the public press, by\r\nthe proceedings of State and county conventions and by abolition sermons\r\nand lectures. The time of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on\r\nthis never-ending subject, and appeals, in pamphlet and other forms,\r\nindorsed by distinguished names, have been sent forth from this central\r\npoint and spread broadcast over the Union.\r\n\r\nHow easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question\r\nforever and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country! They,\r\nand they alone, can do it. All that is necessary to accomplish the object,\r\nand all for which the slave States have ever contended, is to be let alone\r\nand permitted to manage their domestic institutions in their own way. As\r\nsovereign States, they, and they alone, are responsible before God and the\r\nworld for the slavery existing among them. For this the people of the North\r\nare not more responsible and have no more fight to interfere than with\r\nsimilar institutions in Russia or in Brazil.\r\n\r\nUpon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still greatly\r\nrely. Without their aid it is beyond the power of any President, no matter\r\nwhat may be his own political proclivities, to restore peace and harmony\r\namong the States. Wisely limited and restrained as is his power under our\r\nConstitution and laws, he alone can accomplish but little for good or for\r\nevil on such a momentous question.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to observe that the election of any one of our\r\nfellow-citizens to the office of President does not of itself afford just\r\ncause for dissolving the Union. This is more especially true if his\r\nelection has been effected by a mere plurality, and not a majority of the\r\npeople, and has resulted from transient and temporary causes, which may\r\nprobably never again occur. In order to justify a resort to revolutionary\r\nresistance, the Federal Government must be guilty of \"a deliberate,\r\npalpable, and dangerous exercise\" of powers not granted by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe late Presidential election, however, has been held in strict conformity\r\nwith its express provisions. How, then, can the result justify a revolution\r\nto destroy this very Constitution? Reason, justice, a regard for the\r\nConstitution, all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous\r\nact on the part of the President elect before resorting to such a remedy.\r\nIt is said, however, that the antecedents of the President-elect have been\r\nsufficient to justify the fears of the South that he will attempt to invade\r\ntheir constitutional rights. But are such apprehensions of contingent\r\ndanger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the\r\nnoblest system of government ever devised by mortals? From the very nature\r\nof his office and its high responsibilities he must necessarily be\r\nconservative. The stern duty of administering the vast and complicated\r\nconcerns of this Government affords in itself a guaranty that he will not\r\nattempt any violation of a clear constitutional right.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he is no more than the chief executive officer of the\r\nGovernment. His province is not to make but to execute the laws. And it is\r\na remarkable fact in our history that, notwithstanding the repeated efforts\r\nof the antislavery party, no single act has ever passed Congress, unless we\r\nmay possibly except the Missouri compromise, impairing in the slightest\r\ndegree the rights of the South to their property in slaves; and it may also\r\nbe observed, judging from present indications, that no probability exists\r\nof the passage of such an act by a majority of both Houses, either in the\r\npresent or the next Congress. Surely under these circumstances we ought to\r\nbe restrained from present action by the precept of Him who spake as man\r\nnever spoke, that \"sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" The day of\r\nevil may never come unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged as one cause for immediate secession that the Southern States\r\nare denied equal rights with the other States in the common Territories.\r\nBut by what authority are these denied? Not by Congress, which has never\r\npassed, and I believe never will pass, any act to exclude slavery from\r\nthese Territories; and certainly not by the Supreme Court, which has\r\nsolemnly decided that slaves are property, and, like all other property,\r\ntheir owners have a right to take them into the common Territories and hold\r\nthem there under the protection of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSo far then, as Congress is concerned, the objection is not to anything\r\nthey have already done, but to what they may do hereafter. It will surely\r\nbe admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good reason for\r\nan immediate dissolution of the Union. It is true that the Territorial\r\nlegislature of Kansas, on the 23d February, 1860, passed in great haste an\r\nact over the veto of the governor declaring that slavery \"is and shall be\r\nforever prohibited in this Territory.\" Such an act, however, plainly\r\nviolating the rights of property secured by the Constitution, will surely\r\nbe declared void by the judiciary whenever it shall be presented in a legal\r\nform.\r\n\r\nOnly three days after my inauguration the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a Territorial\r\nlegislature. Yet such has been the factious temper of the times that the\r\ncorrectness of this decision has been extensively impugned before the\r\npeople, and the question has given rise to angry political conflicts\r\nthroughout the country. Those who have appealed from this judgment of our\r\nhighest constitutional tribunal to popular assemblies would, if they could,\r\ninvest a Territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred rights of\r\nproperty. This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal\r\nConstitution to exercise. Every State legislature in the Union is forbidden\r\nby its own constitution to exercise it. It can not be exercised in any\r\nState except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity, when\r\nframing or amending their State constitution. In like manner it can only be\r\nexercised by the people of a Territory represented in a convention of\r\ndelegates for the purpose of framing a constitution preparatory to\r\nadmission as a State into the Union. Then, and not until then, are they\r\ninvested with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall\r\nnot exist within their limits. This is an act of sovereign authority, and\r\nnot of subordinate Territorial legislation. Were it otherwise, then indeed\r\nwould the equality of the States in the Territories be destroyed, and the\r\nrights of property in slaves would depend not upon the guaranties of the\r\nConstitution, but upon the shifting majorities of an irresponsible\r\nTerritorial legislature. Such a doctrine, from its intrinsic unsoundness,\r\ncan not long influence any considerable portion of our people, much less\r\ncan it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been\r\ncommitted consist in the acts of different State legislatures to defeat the\r\nexecution of the fugitive-slave law. It ought to be remembered, however,\r\nthat for these acts neither Congress nor any President can justly be held\r\nresponsible. Having been passed in violation of the Federal Constitution,\r\nthey are therefore null and void. All the courts, both State and national,\r\nbefore whom the question has arisen have from the beginning declared the\r\nfugitive-slave law to be constitutional. The single exception is that of a\r\nState court in Wisconsin, and this has not only been reversed by the proper\r\nappellate tribunal, but has met with such universal reprobation that there\r\ncan be no danger from it as a precedent. The validity of this law has been\r\nestablished over and over again by the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nwith perfect unanimity. It is rounded upon an express provision of the\r\nConstitution, requiring that fugitive slaves who escape from service in one\r\nState to another shall be \"delivered up\" to their masters. Without this\r\nprovision it is a well-known historical fact that the Constitution itself\r\ncould never have been adopted by the Convention. In one form or other,\r\nunder the acts of 1793 and 1850, both being substantially the same, the\r\nfugitive-slave law has been the law of the land from the days of Washington\r\nuntil the present moment. Here, then, a clear case is presented in which it\r\nwill be the duty of the next President, as it has been my own, to act with\r\nvigor in executing this supreme law against the conflicting enactments of\r\nState legislatures. Should he fail in the performance of this high duty, he\r\nwill then have manifested a disregard of the Constitution and laws, to the\r\ngreat injury of the people of nearly one-half of the States of the Union.\r\nBut are we to presume in advance that he will thus violate his duty? This\r\nwould be at war with every principle of justice and of Christian charity.\r\nLet us wait for the overt act. The fugitive-slave law has been carried into\r\nexecution in every contested case since the commencement of the present\r\nAdministration, though Often, it is to be regretted, with great loss and\r\ninconvenience to the master and with considerable expense to the\r\nGovernment. Let us trust that the State legislatures will repeal their\r\nunconstitutional and obnoxious enactments. Unless this shall be done\r\nwithout unnecessary delay, it is impossible for any human power to save the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States, standing on the basis of the Constitution, have right\r\nto demand this act of justice from the States of the North. Should it be\r\nrefused, then the Constitution, to which all the States are parties, will\r\nhave been willfully violated by one portion of them in a provision\r\nessential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder. In that\r\nevent the injured States, after having first used all peaceful and\r\nconstitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary\r\nresistance to the Government of the Union.\r\n\r\nI have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance, because\r\nit has been claimed within the last few years that any State, whenever this\r\nshall be its sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from the Union in\r\naccordance with the Constitution and without any violation of the\r\nconstitutional rights of the other members of the Confederacy; that as each\r\nbecame parties to the Union by the vote of its own people assembled in\r\nconvention, so any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar\r\nmanner by the vote of such a convention.\r\n\r\nIn order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it must be on the\r\nprinciple that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of\r\nStates, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties.\r\nIf this be so, the Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be penetrated and\r\ndissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the States.\r\nIn this manner our thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as many\r\npetty, jarring, and hostile republics, each one retiring from the Union\r\nwithout responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to\r\nsuch a course. By this process a Union might be entirely broken into\r\nfragments in a few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil,\r\nprivation, and blood to establish.\r\n\r\nSuch a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the\r\ncharacter of the Federal Constitution. After it was framed with the\r\ngreatest deliberation and care it was submitted to conventions of the\r\npeople of the several States for ratification. Its provisions were\r\ndiscussed at length in these bodies, composed of the first men of the\r\ncountry. Its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the Federal\r\nGovernment dangerous to the rights of the States, whilst its advocates\r\nmaintained that under a fair construction of the instrument there was no\r\nfoundation for such apprehensions. In that mighty struggle between the\r\nfirst intellects of this or any other country it never occurred to any\r\nindividual, either among its opponents or advocates, to assert or even to\r\nintimate that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that\r\nany State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from the Union. What a\r\ncrushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the\r\nrights of the States would be endangered by the Constitution! The truth is\r\nthat it was not until many years after the origin of the Federal Government\r\nthat such a proposition was first advanced. It was then met and refuted by\r\nthe conclusive arguments of General Jackson, who in his message of the 16th\r\nof January, 1833, transmitting the nullifying ordinance of South Carolina\r\nto Congress, employs the following language:\r\n\r\nThe right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will and\r\nwithout the consent of the other States from their most solemn obligations,\r\nand hazard the liberties and happiness of the millions composing this\r\nUnion, can not be acknowledged. Such authority is believed to be utterly\r\nrepugnant both to the principles upon which the General Government is\r\nconstituted and to the objects which it is expressly formed to attain.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that any clause in the Constitution gives countenance\r\nto such a theory. It is altogether rounded upon inference; not from any\r\nlanguage contained in the instrument itself, but from the sovereign\r\ncharacter of the several States by which it was ratified. But is it beyond\r\nthe power of a State, like an individual, to yield a portion of its\r\nsovereign rights to secure the remainder? In the language of Mr. Madison,\r\nwho has been called the father of the Constitution--\r\n\r\nIt was formed by the States; that is, by the people in each of the States\r\nacting in their highest sovereign capacity, and formed, consequently, by\r\nthe same authority which formed the State constitutions. Nor is the\r\nGovernment of the United States, created by the Constitution, less a\r\ngovernment, in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of its\r\npowers than the governments created by the constitutions of the States are\r\nwithin their several spheres. It is, like them, organized into legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary departments. It operates, like them directly on\r\npersons and things, and, like them, it has at command a physical force for\r\nexecuting the powers committed to it.\r\n\r\nIt was intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure of\r\nany one of the contracting parties. The old Articles of Confederation were\r\nentitled \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the\r\nStates,\" and by the thirteenth article it is expressly declared that \"the\r\narticles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State,\r\nand the Union shall be perpetual.\" The preamble to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, having express reference to the Articles of Confederation,\r\nrecites that it was established \"in order to form a more perfect union.\"\r\nAnd yet it is contended that this \"more perfect union\" does not include the\r\nessential attribute of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nBut that the Union was designed to be perpetual appears conclusively from\r\nthe nature and extent of the powers conferred by the Constitution on the\r\nFederal Government. These powers embrace the very highest attributes of\r\nnational sovereignty. They place both the sword and the purse under its\r\ncontrol. Congress has power to make war and to make peace, to raise and\r\nsupport armies and navies, and to conclude treaties with foreign\r\ngovernments. It is invested with the power to coin money and to regulate\r\nthe value thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among\r\nthe several States. It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers\r\nwhich have been conferred upon the Federal Government. In order to carry\r\nthe enumerated powers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive right\r\nto lay and collect duties on imports, and, in common with the States, to\r\nlay and collect all other taxes.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution has not only conferred these high powers upon\r\nCongress, but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the States from\r\ninterfering with their exercise. For that purpose it has in strong\r\nprohibitory language expressly declared that--\r\n\r\nNo State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant\r\nletters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make\r\nanything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any\r\nbill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts. Moreover--\r\n\r\nNo State shall without the consent of the Congress lay any imposts or\r\nduties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for\r\nexecuting its inspection laws.\r\n\r\nAnd if they exceed this amount the excess shall belong, to the United\r\nStates. And--\r\n\r\nNo State shall without the consent of Congress lay any duty of tonnage,\r\nkeep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or\r\ncompact with another State or with a foreign power, or engage in war,\r\nunless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nIn order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high\r\npowers against State interposition, it is provided that--\r\n\r\nThis Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in\r\npursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be made under the\r\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and\r\nthe judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to the obligations of\r\nofficial duty, and all Senators and Representatives of the United States,\r\nall members of State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers,\r\n\"both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by\r\noath or affirmation to support this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to carry into effect these powers, the Constitution has\r\nestablished a perfect Government in all its forms--legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial; and this Government to the extent of its powers acts directly\r\nupon the individual citizens of every State, and executes its own decrees\r\nby the agency of its own officers. In this respect it differs entirely from\r\nthe Government under the old Confederation, which was confined to making\r\nrequisitions on the States in their sovereign character. This left it in\r\nthe discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse, and they often\r\ndeclined to comply with such requisitions. It thus became necessary for the\r\npurpose of removing this barrier and \"in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion\" to establish a Government which could act directly upon the people\r\nand execute its own laws without the intermediate agency of the States.\r\nThis has been accomplished by the Constitution of the United States. In\r\nshort, the Government created by the Constitution, and deriving its\r\nauthority from the sovereign people of each of the several States, has\r\nprecisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these\r\nStates in the enumerated cases that each one of them possesses over\r\nsubjects not delegated to the United States, but \"reserved to the States\r\nrespectively or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nTo the extent of the delegated powers the Constitution of the United States\r\nis as much a part of the constitution of each State and is as binding upon\r\nits people as though it had been textually inserted therein.\r\n\r\nThis Government, therefore, is a great and powerful Government, invested\r\nwith all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which\r\nits authority extends. Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom\r\nthe seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its creation guilty of\r\nthe absurdity of providing for its own dissolution. It was not intended by\r\nits framers to be the baseless fabric of a vision, which at the touch of\r\nthe enchanter would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mighty\r\nfabric, capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of defying the\r\nstorms of ages. Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of that day have\r\nindulged fears that a Government of such high powers might violate the\r\nreserved rights of the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a\r\nstrict construction of these powers to prevent the danger. But they did not\r\nfear, nor had they any reason to imagine, that the Constitution would ever\r\nbe so interpreted as to enable any State by her own act, and without the\r\nconsent of her sister States, to discharge her people from all or any of\r\ntheir federal obligations.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, then, Are the people of the States without redress against\r\nthe tyranny and oppression of the Federal Government? By no means. The\r\nright of resistance on the part of the governed against the oppression of\r\ntheir governments can not be denied. It exists independently of all\r\nconstitutions, and has been exercised at all periods of the world's\r\nhistory. Under it old governments have been destroyed and new ones have\r\ntaken their place. It is embodied in strong and express language in our own\r\nDeclaration of Independence. But the distinction must ever be observed that\r\nthis is revolution against an established government, and not a voluntary\r\nsecession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In short,\r\nlet us look the danger fairly in the face. Secession is neither more nor\r\nless than revolution. It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution, but\r\nstill it is revolution.\r\n\r\nWhat, in the meantime, is the responsibility and true position of the\r\nExecutive? He is bound by solemn oath, before God and the country, \"to take\r\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and from this obligation he can\r\nnot be absolved by any human power. But what if the performance of this\r\nduty, in whole or in part, has been rendered impracticable by events over\r\nwhich he could have exercised no control? Such at the present moment is the\r\ncase throughout the State of South Carolina so far as the laws of the\r\nUnited States to secure the administration of justice by means of the\r\nFederal judiciary are concerned. All the Federal officers within its limits\r\nthrough whose agency alone these laws can be carried into execution have\r\nalready resigned. We no longer have a district judge, a district attorney,\r\nor a marshal in South Carolina. In fact, the whole machinery of the Federal\r\nGovernment necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the\r\npeople has been demolished, and it would be difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto replace it.\r\n\r\nThe only acts of Congress on the statute book bearing upon this subject are\r\nthose of February 28, 1795, and March 3, 1807. These authorize the\r\nPresident, after he shall have ascertained that the marshal, with his posse\r\ncomitatus, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular\r\ncase, to call forth the militia and employ the Army and Navy to aid him in\r\nperforming this service, having first by proclamation commanded the\r\ninsurgents \"to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes\r\nwithin a limited time\" This duty can not by possibility be performed in a\r\nState where no judicial authority exists to issue process, and where there\r\nis no marshal to execute it, and where, even if there were such an officer,\r\nthe entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are\r\nwithout further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single\r\nState, not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a similar\r\nattitude. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can\r\nor can not be amended so as to carry out more effectually the objects of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the laws\r\nfor the collection of the customs. The revenue still continues to be\r\ncollected as heretofore at the custom-house in Charleston, and should the\r\ncollector unfortunately resign a successor may be appointed to perform this\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThen, in regard to the property of the United States in South Carolina.\r\nThis has been purchased for a fair equivalent, \"by the consent of the\r\nlegislature of the State,\" \"for the erection of forts, magazines,\r\narsenals,\" etc., and over these the authority \"to exercise exclusive\r\nlegislation\" has been expressly granted by the Constitution to Congress. It\r\nis not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the United States\r\nfrom this property by force; but if in this I should prove to be mistaken,\r\nthe officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on\r\nthe defensive. In such a contingency the responsibility for consequences\r\nwould rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants.\r\n\r\nApart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable,\r\nthe Executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations\r\nbetween the Federal Government and South Carolina. He has been invested\r\nwith no such discretion. He possesses no power to change the relations\r\nheretofore existing between them, much less to acknowledge the independence\r\nof that State. This would be to invest a mere executive officer with the\r\npower of recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy among our\r\nthirty-three sovereign States. It bears no resemblance to the recognition\r\nof a foreign de facto government, involving no such responsibility. Any\r\nattempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It is\r\ntherefore my duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its\r\nbeatings. The course of events is so rapidly hastening forward that the\r\nemergency may soon arise when you may be called upon to decide the\r\nmomentous question whether you possess the power by force of arms to compel\r\na State to remain in the Union. I should feel myself recreant to my duty\r\nwere I not to express an opinion on this important subject.\r\n\r\nThe question fairly stated is, Has the Constitution delegated to Congress\r\nthe power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw\r\nor has actually withdrawn from the Confederacy? If answered in the\r\naffirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred\r\nupon Congress to declare and to make war against a State. After much\r\nserious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has\r\nbeen delegated to Congress or to any other department of the Federal\r\nGovernment. It is manifest upon an inspection of the Constitution that this\r\nis not among the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress, and it\r\nis equally apparent that its exercise is not \"necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying into execution\" any one of these powers. So far from this power\r\nhaving been delegated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the\r\nConvention which framed the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the proceedings of that body that on the 31st May, 1787,\r\nthe clause \"authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against a\r\ndelinquent State\" came up for consideration. Mr. Madison opposed it in a\r\nbrief but powerful speech, from which I shall extract but a single\r\nsentence. He observed:\r\n\r\nThe use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war\r\nthan an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the\r\nparty attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might\r\nbe bound.\r\n\r\nUpon his motion the clause was unanimously postponed, and was never, I\r\nbelieve, again presented. Soon afterwards, on the 8th June, 1787, when\r\nincidentally adverting to the subject, he said: \"Any government for the\r\nUnited States formed on the supposed practicability of using force against\r\nthe unconstitutional proceedings of the States would prove as visionary and\r\nfallacious as the government of Congress,\" evidently meaning the then\r\nexisting Congress of the old Confederation.\r\n\r\nWithout descending to particulars, it may be safely asserted that the power\r\nto make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent\r\nof the Constitution. Suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a\r\nState; how are we to govern it afterwards? Shall we hold it as a province\r\nand govern it by despotic power? In the nature of things, we could not by\r\nphysical force control the will of the people and compel them to elect\r\nSenators and Representatives to Congress and to perform all the other\r\nduties depending upon their own volition and required from the free\r\ncitizens of a free State as a constituent member of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nBut if we possessed this power, would it be wise to exercise it under\r\nexisting circumstances? The object would doubtless be to preserve the\r\nUnion. War would not only present the most effectual means of destroying\r\nit, but would vanish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction. Besides, in\r\nthe fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be\r\nexpended, rendering future reconciliation between the States impossible. In\r\nthe meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations\r\nof the people during its existence?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be\r\ncemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it can not live\r\nin the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Congress possesses\r\nmany means of preserving it by conciliation, but the sword was not placed\r\nin their hand to preserve it by force.\r\n\r\nBut may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and\r\ndeliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which\r\nhas ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began? It has been\r\nconsecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of the past, and by\r\nthe hopes of the future. The Union has already made us the most prosperous,\r\nand ere long will, if preserved, render us the most powerful, nation on the\r\nface of the earth. In every foreign region of the globe the title of\r\nAmerican citizen is held in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a\r\nforeign land it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest\r\npride. Surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss we shall recoil\r\nwith horror from the last fatal plunge.\r\n\r\nBy such a dread catastrophe the hopes of the friends of freedom throughout\r\nthe world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden despotism would\r\nenshroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty years would not only\r\nbe lost, but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nIt is not every wrong--nay, it is not every grievous wrong--which can\r\njustify a resort to such a fearful alternative. This ought to be the last\r\ndesperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional\r\nmeans of conciliation had been exhausted. We should reflect that under this\r\nfree Government there is an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion. The\r\nslavery question, like everything human, will have its day. I firmly\r\nbelieve that it has reached and passed the culminating point. But if in the\r\nmidst of the existing excitement the Union shall perish, the evil may then\r\nbecome irreparable.\r\n\r\nCongress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recommending to\r\nthe legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils which\r\nthe Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation. This has\r\nbeen tried at different critical periods of our history, and always with\r\neminent success. It is to be found in the fifth article, providing for its\r\nown amendment. Under this article amendments have been proposed by\r\ntwo-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and have been \"ratified by the\r\nlegislatures of three-fourths of the several States,\" and have consequently\r\nbecome parts of the Constitution. To this process the country is indebted\r\nfor the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law respecting an\r\nestablishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or of the\r\npress or of the right of petition. To this we are also indebted for the\r\nbill of rights which secures the people against any abuse of power by the\r\nFederal Government. Such were the apprehensions justly entertained by the\r\nfriends of State rights at that period as to have rendered it extremely\r\ndoubtful whether the Constitution could have long survived without those\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nAgain the Constitution was amended by the same process, after the election\r\nof President Jefferson by the House of Representatives, in February, 1803.\r\nThis amendment was rendered necessary to prevent a recurrence of the\r\ndangers which had seriously threatened the existence of the Government\r\nduring the pendency of that election. The article for its own amendment was\r\nintended to secure the amicable adjustment of conflicting constitutional\r\nquestions like the present which might arise between the governments of the\r\nStates and that of the United States. This appears from contemporaneous\r\nhistory. In this connection I shall merely call attention to a few\r\nsentences in Mr. Madison's justly celebrated report, in 1799, to the\r\nlegislature of Virginia. In this he ably and conclusively defended the\r\nresolutions of the preceding legislature against the strictures of several\r\nother State legislatures. These were mainly rounded upon the protest of the\r\nVirginia legislature against the \"alien and sedition acts,\" as \"palpable\r\nand alarming infractions of the Constitution.\" In pointing out the peaceful\r\nand constitutional remedies--and he referred to none other--to which the\r\nStates were authorized to resort on such occasions, he concludes by saying\r\nthat--\r\n\r\nThe legislatures of the States might have made a direct representation to\r\nCongress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts, or\r\nthey might have represented to their respective Senators in Congress their\r\nwish that two-thirds thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the\r\nConstitution; or two-thirds of themselves, if such had been their option,\r\nmight by an application to Congress have obtained a convention for the same\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThis is the very course which I earnestly recommend in order to obtain an\r\n\"explanatory amendment\" of the Constitution on the subject of slavery. This\r\nmight originate with Congress or the State legislatures, as may be deemed\r\nmost advisable to attain the object. The explanatory amendment might be\r\nconfined to the final settlement of the true construction of the\r\nConstitution on three special points:\r\n\r\n1. An express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the States\r\nwhere it now exists or may hereafter exist.\r\n\r\n2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common Territories\r\nthroughout their Territorial existence, and until they shall be admitted as\r\nStates into the Union, with or without slavery, as their constitutions may\r\nprescribe.\r\n\r\n3. A like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave who has\r\nescaped from one State to another restored and \"delivered up\" to him, and\r\nof the validity of the fugitive-slave law enacted for this purpose,\r\ntogether with a declaration that all State laws impairing or defeating this\r\nright are violations of the Constitution, and are consequently null and\r\nvoid. It may be objected that this construction of the Constitution has\r\nalready been settled by the Supreme Court of the United States, and what\r\nmore ought to be required? The answer is that a very large proportion of\r\nthe people of the United States still contest the correctness of this\r\ndecision, and never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force\r\nuntil clearly established by the people of the several States in their\r\nsovereign character. Such an explanatory amendment would, it is believed,\r\nforever terminate the existing dissensions, and restore peace and harmony\r\namong the States.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be doubted that such an appeal to the arbitrament\r\nestablished by the Constitution itself would be received with favor by all\r\nthe States of the Confederacy. In any event, it ought to be tried in a\r\nspirit of conciliation before any of these States shall separate themselves\r\nfrom the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon the duties of the Presidential office, the aspect\r\nneither of our foreign nor domestic affairs was at all satisfactory. We\r\nwere involved in dangerous complications with several nations, and two of\r\nour Territories were in a state of revolution against the Government. A\r\nrestoration of the African slave trade had numerous and powerful advocates.\r\nUnlawful military expeditions were countenanced by many of our citizens,\r\nand were suffered, in defiance of the efforts of the Government, to escape\r\nfrom our shores for the purpose of making war upon the offending people of\r\nneighboring republics with whom we were at peace. In addition to these and\r\nother difficulties, we experienced a revulsion in monetary affairs soon\r\nafter my advent to power of unexampled severity and of ruinous consequences\r\nto all the great interests of the country. When we take a retrospect of\r\nwhat was then our condition and contrast this with its material prosperity\r\nat the time of the late Presidential election, we have abundant reason to\r\nreturn our grateful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never\r\nforsaken us as a nation in all our past trials.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character. Since\r\nthe commencement of my Administration the two dangerous questions arising\r\nfrom the Clayton and Bulwer treaty and from the right of search claimed by\r\nthe British Government have been amicably and honorably adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe discordant constructions of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty between the\r\ntwo Governments, which at different periods of the discussion bore a\r\nthreatening aspect, have resulted in a final settlement entirely\r\nsatisfactory to this Government. In my last annual message I informed\r\nCongress that the British Government had not then \"completed treaty\r\narrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua in pursuance of\r\nthe understanding between the two Governments. It is, nevertheless,\r\nconfidently expected that this good work will ere long be accomplished.\"\r\nThis confident expectation has since been fulfilled. Her Britannic Majesty\r\nconcluded a treaty with Honduras on the 28th November, 1859, and with\r\nNicaragua on the 28th August, 1860, relinquishing the Mosquito\r\nprotectorate. Besides, by the former the Bay Islands are recognized as a\r\npart of the Republic of Honduras. It may be observed that the stipulations\r\nof these treaties conform in every important particular to the amendments\r\nadopted by the Senate of the United States to the treaty concluded at\r\nLondon on the 17th October, 1856, between the two Governments. It will be\r\nrecollected that this treaty was rejected by the British Government because\r\nof its objection to the just and important amendment of the Senate to the\r\narticle relating to Ruatan and the other islands in the Bay of Honduras.\r\n\r\nIt must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all classes of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and especially to those engaged in foreign commerce, that\r\nthe claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit and search\r\nAmerican merchant vessels on the high seas in time of peace has been\r\nabandoned. This was by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the\r\ntwo countries which has existed since the War of 1812. Whilst it remained\r\nopen they might at any moment have been precipitated into a war. This was\r\nrendered manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout our\r\nentire country produced by the forcible search of American merchant vessels\r\nby British cruisers on the coast of Cuba in the spring of 1858. The\r\nAmerican people hailed with general acclaim the orders of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico \"to protect all vessels\r\nof the United States on the high seas from search or detention by the\r\nvessels of war of any other nation.\" These orders might have produced an\r\nimmediate collision between the naval forces of the two countries. This was\r\nmost fortunately prevented by an appeal to the justice of Great Britain and\r\nto the law of nations as expounded by her own most eminent jurists.\r\n\r\nThe only question of any importance which still remains open is the\r\ndisputed title between the two Governments to the island of San Juan, in\r\nthe vicinity of Washington Territory. As this question is still under\r\nnegotiation, it is not deemed advisable at the present moment to make any\r\nother allusion to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a private character, to the\r\npeople of this country has proved to be a most auspicious event. In its\r\nconsequences it can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings\r\nwhich I trust may ever actuate the Government and people of both countries\r\nin their political and social intercourse with each other.\r\n\r\nWith France, our ancient and powerful ally, our relations continue to be of\r\nthe most friendly character. A decision has recently been made by a French\r\njudicial tribunal, with the approbation of the Imperial Government, which\r\ncan not fail to foster the sentiments of mutual regard that have so long\r\nexisted between the two countries. Under the French law no person can serve\r\nin the armies of France unless he be a French citizen. The law of France\r\nrecognizing the natural right of expatriation, it follows as a necessary\r\nconsequence that a Frenchman by the fact of having become a citizen of the\r\nUnited States has changed his allegiance and has lost his native character.\r\nHe can not therefore be compelled to serve in the French armies in case he\r\nshould return to his native country. These principles were announced in\r\n1852 by the French minister of war and in two late cases have been\r\nconfirmed by the French judiciary. In these, two natives of France have\r\nbeen discharged from the French army because they had become American\r\ncitizens. To employ the language of our present minister to France, who has\r\nrendered good service on this occasion. \"I do not think our French\r\nnaturalized fellow-citizens will hereafter experience much annoyance on\r\nthis subject.\"\r\n\r\nI venture to predict that the time is not far distant when the other\r\ncontinental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy which has done\r\nso much honor to the enlightened Government of the Emperor. In any event,\r\nour Government is bound to protect the rights of our naturalized citizens\r\neverywhere to the same extent as though they had drawn their first breath\r\nin this country. We can recognize no distinction between our native and\r\nnaturalized citizens.\r\n\r\nBetween the great Empire of Russia and the United States the mutual\r\nfriendship and regard which has so long existed still continues to prevail,\r\nand if possible to increase. Indeed, our relations with that Empire are all\r\nthat we could desire. Our relations with Spain are now of a more\r\ncomplicated, though less dangerous, character than they have been for many\r\nyears. Our citizens have long held and continue to hold numerous claims\r\nagainst the Spanish Government. These had been ably urged for a series of\r\nyears by our successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid, but without\r\nobtaining redress. The Spanish Government finally agreed to institute a\r\njoint commission for the adjustment of these claims, and on the 5th day of\r\nMarch, 1860, concluded a convention for this purpose with our present\r\nminister at Madrid.\r\n\r\nUnder this convention what have been denominated the \"Cuban claims,\"\r\namounting to $128,635.54, in which more than 100 of our fellow-citizens are\r\ninterested, were recognized, and the Spanish Government agreed to pay\r\n$100,000 of this amount \"within three months following the exchange of\r\nratifications.\" The payment of the remaining $28,635.54 was to await the\r\ndecision of the commissioners for or against the Amistad claim; but in any\r\nevent the balance was to be paid to the claimants either by Spain or the\r\nUnited States. These terms, I have every reason to know, are highly\r\nsatisfactory to the holders of the Cuban claims. Indeed, they have made a\r\nformal offer authorizing the State Department to settle these claims and to\r\ndeduct the amount of the Amistad claim from the sums which they are\r\nentitled to receive from Spain. This offer, of course, can not be accepted.\r\nAll other claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, or the\r\nsubjects of the Queen of Spain against the United States, including the\r\nAmistad claim, were by this convention referred to a board of commissioners\r\nin the usual form. Neither the validity of the Amistad claim nor of any\r\nother claim against either party, with the single exception of the Cuban\r\nclaims, was recognized by the convention. Indeed, the Spanish Government\r\ndid not insist that the validity of the Amistad claim should be thus\r\nrecognized, notwithstanding its payment had been recommended to Congress by\r\ntwo of my predecessors, as well as by myself, and an appropriation for that\r\npurpose had passed the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nThey were content that it should be submitted to the board for examination\r\nand decision like the other claims. Both Governments were bound\r\nrespectively to pay the amounts awarded to the several claimants \"at such\r\ntimes and places as may be fixed by and according to the tenor of said\r\nawards.\"\r\n\r\nI transmitted this convention to the Senate for their constitutional action\r\non the 3d of May, 1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June they\r\ndetermined that they would \"not advise and consent\" to its ratification.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings place our relations with Spain in an awkward and\r\nembarrassing position. It is more than probable that the final adjustment\r\nof these claims will devolve upon my successor.\r\n\r\nI reiterate the recommendation contained in my annual message of December,\r\n1858, and repeated in that of December, 1859, in favor of the acquisition\r\nof Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly believe that such an\r\nacquisition would contribute essentially to the well-being and prosperity\r\nof both countries in all future time, as well as prove the certain means of\r\nimmediately abolishing the African slave trade throughout the world. I\r\nwould not repeat this recommendation upon the present occasion if I\r\nbelieved that the transfer of Cuba to the United States upon conditions\r\nhighly favorable to Spain could justly tarnish the national honor of the\r\nproud and ancient Spanish monarchy. Surely no person ever attributed to the\r\nfirst Napoleon a disregard of the national honor of France for transferring\r\nLouisiana to the United States for a fair equivalent, both in money and\r\ncommercial advantages.\r\n\r\nWith the Emperor of Austria and the remaining continental powers of Europe,\r\nincluding that of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of the most\r\nfriendly character.\r\n\r\nThe friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Government of the United\r\nStates toward the Empire of China has produced the most satisfactory\r\nresults. The treaty of Tien-tsin of the 18th June, 1858, has been\r\nfaithfully observed by the Chinese authorities. The convention of the 8th\r\nNovember, 1858, supplementary to this treaty, for the adjustment and\r\nsatisfaction of the claims of our citizens on China referred to in my last\r\nannual message, has been already carried into effect so far as this was\r\npracticable. Under this convention the sum of 500,000 taels, equal to about\r\n$700,000, was stipulated to be paid in satisfaction of the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens out of the one-fifth of the receipts for tonnage, import,\r\nand export duties on American vessels at the ports of Canton, Shanghai, and\r\nFuchau, and it was \"agreed that this amount shall be in full liquidation of\r\nall claims of American citizens at the various ports to this date.\"\r\nDebentures for this amount, to wit, 300,000 taels for Canton, 100,000 for\r\nShanghai, and 100,000 for Fuchau, were delivered, according to the terms of\r\nthe convention, by the respective Chinese collectors of the customs of\r\nthese ports to the agent selected by our minister to receive the same.\r\nSince that time the claims of our citizens have been adjusted by the board\r\nof commissioners appointed for that purpose under the act of March 3, 1859,\r\nand their awards, which proved satisfactory to the claimants, have been\r\napproved by our minister. In the aggregate they amount to the sum of\r\n$498,694.78. The claimants have already received a large proportion of the\r\nsums awarded to them out of the fund provided, and it is confidently\r\nexpected that the remainder will ere long be entirely paid. After the\r\nawards shall have been satisfied there will remain a surplus of more than\r\n$200,000 at the disposition of Congress. As this will, in equity, belong to\r\nthe Chinese Government, would not justice require its appropriation to some\r\nbenevolent object in which the Chinese may be specially interested?\r\n\r\nOur minister to China, in obedience to his instructions, has remained\r\nperfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the\r\nChinese Empire, although, in conjunction with the Russian minister, he was\r\never ready and willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ his good\r\noffices in restoring peace between the parties. It is but an act of simple\r\njustice, both to our present minister and his predecessor, to state that\r\nthey have proved fully equal to the delicate, trying, and responsible\r\npositions in which they have on different occasions been placed.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty with Japan concluded at Yeddo on the 29th\r\nJuly, 1858, were exchanged at Washington on the 22d May last, and the\r\ntreaty itself was proclaimed on the succeeding day. There is good reason to\r\nexpect that under its protection and influence our trade and intercourse\r\nwith that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with unusual solemnity. For\r\nthis purpose the Tycoon had accredited three of his most distinguished\r\nsubjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, who were\r\nreceived and treated with marked distinction and kindness, both by the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve that they have returned to their native land entirely satisfied\r\nwith their visit and inspired by the most friendly feelings for our\r\ncountry. Let us ardently hope, in the language of the treaty itself, that\r\n\"there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the\r\nUnited States of America and His Majesty the Tycoon of Japan and his\r\nsuccessors.\"\r\n\r\nWith the wise, conservative, and liberal Government of the Empire of Brazil\r\nour relations continue to be of the most amicable character.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of the ratifications of the convention with the Republic of\r\nNew Granada signed at Washington on the 10th of September, 1857, has been\r\nlong delayed from accidental causes for which neither party is censurable.\r\nThese ratifications were duly exchanged in this city on the 5th of November\r\nlast. Thus has a controversy been amicably terminated which had become so\r\nserious at the period of my inauguration as to require me, on the 17th of\r\nApril, 1857, to direct our minister to demand his passports and return to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nUnder this convention the Government of New Granada has specially\r\nacknowledged itself to be responsible to our citizens \"for damages which\r\nwere caused by the riot at Panama on the 15th April, 1856.\" These claims,\r\ntogether with other claims of our citizens which had been long urged in\r\nvain, are referred for adjustment to a board of commissioners. I submit a\r\ncopy of the convention to Congress, and recommend the legislation necessary\r\nto carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nPersevering efforts have been made for the adjustment of the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens against the Government of Costa Rica, and I am happy to\r\ninform you that these have finally prevailed. A convention was signed at\r\nthe city of San Jose on the 2d July last, between the minister resident of\r\nthe United States in Costa Rica and the plenipotentiaries of that Republic,\r\nreferring these claims to a board of commissioners and providing for the\r\npayment of their awards. This convention will be submitted immediately to\r\nthe Senate for their constitutional action.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua have not yet been\r\nprovided for by treaty, although diligent efforts for this purpose have\r\nbeen made by our minister resident to that Republic. These are still\r\ncontinued, with a fair prospect of success.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition. In my\r\nlast two annual messages I discussed extensively the subject of these\r\nrelations, and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and\r\narguments then presented. They proved conclusively that our citizens\r\nresiding in Mexico and our merchants trading thereto had suffered a series\r\nof wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiently borne from any other\r\nnation. For these our successive ministers, invoking the faith of treaties,\r\nhad in the name of their country persistently demanded redress and\r\nindemnification, but without the slightest effect. Indeed, so confident had\r\nthe Mexican authorities become of our patient endurance that they\r\nuniversally believed they might commit these outrages upon American\r\ncitizens with absolute impunity. Thus wrote our minister in 1856, and\r\nexpressed the opinion that \"nothing but a manifestation of the power of the\r\nGovernment and of its purpose to punish these wrongs will avail.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in 1857, came the adoption of a new constitution for Mexico,\r\nthe election of a President and Congress under its provisions, and the\r\ninauguration of the President. Within one short month, however, this\r\nPresident was expelled from the capital by a rebellion in the army, and the\r\nsupreme power of the Republic was assigned to General Zuloaga. This usurper\r\nwas in his turn soon compelled to retire and give place to General\r\nMiramon.\r\n\r\nUnder the constitution which had thus been adopted Senor Juarez, as chief\r\njustice of the supreme court, became the lawful President of the Republic,\r\nand it was for the maintenance of the constitution and his authority\r\nderived from it that the civil war commenced and still continues to be\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year 1858 the constitutional party grew stronger and\r\nstronger. In the previous history of Mexico a successful military\r\nrevolution at the capital had almost universally been the signal for\r\nsubmission throughout the Republic. Not so on the present occasion. A\r\nmajority of the citizens persistently sustained the constitutional\r\nGovernment. When this was recognized, in April, 1859, by the Government of\r\nthe United States, its authority extended over a large majority of the\r\nMexican States and people, including Vera Cruz and all the other important\r\nseaports of the Republic. From that period our commerce with Mexico began\r\nto revive, and the constitutional Government has afforded it all the\r\nprotection in its power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Government of Miramon still held sway at the capital and over\r\nthe surrounding country, and continued its outrages against the few\r\nAmerican citizens who still had the courage to remain within its power. To\r\ncap the climax, after the battle of Tacubaya, in April, 1859, General\r\nMarquez ordered three citizens of the United States, two of them\r\nphysicians, to be seized in the hospital at that place, taken out and shot,\r\nwithout crime and without trial. This was done, notwithstanding our\r\nunfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged in the holy cause of\r\naffording relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded in\r\nthe battle, without making any distinction between them.\r\n\r\nThe time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Government was bound to\r\nexert its power to avenge and redress the wrongs of our citizens and to\r\nafford them protection in Mexico. The interposing obstacle was that the\r\nportion of the country under the sway of Miramon could not be reached\r\nwithout passing over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional\r\nGovernment. Under these circumstances I deemed it my duty to recommend to\r\nCongress in my last annual message the employment of a sufficient military\r\nforce to penetrate into the interior, where the Government of Miramon was\r\nto be found, with or, if need be, without the consent of the Juarez\r\nGovernment, though it was not doubted that this consent could be obtained.\r\nNever have I had a clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as\r\nwell as wisdom of such a policy. No other alternative was left except the\r\nentire abandonment of our fellow-citizens who had gone to Mexico under the\r\nfaith of treaties to the systematic injustice, cruelty, and oppression of\r\nMiramon's Government. Besides, it is almost certain that the simple\r\nauthority to employ this force would of itself have accomplished all our\r\nobjects without striking a single blow. The constitutional Government would\r\nthen ere this have been established at the City of Mexico, and would have\r\nbeen ready and willing to the extent of its ability to do us justice.\r\n\r\nIn addition--and I deem this a most important consideration--European\r\nGovernments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the\r\nterritorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have been\r\nrelieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force should this become\r\nnecessary, any attempt by these Governments to deprive our neighboring\r\nRepublic of portions of her territory--a duty from which we could not\r\nshrink without abandoning the traditional and established policy of the\r\nAmerican people. I am happy to observe that, firmly relying upon the\r\njustice and good faith of these Governments, there is no present danger\r\nthat such a contingency will happen.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered that my recommendations would not be sustained by\r\nCongress, the next alternative was to accomplish in some degree, if\r\npossible, the same objects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional\r\nGovernment. Such treaties were accordingly concluded by our late able and\r\nexcellent minister to Mexico, and on the 4th of January last were submitted\r\nto the Senate for ratification. As these have not yet received the final\r\naction of that body, it would be improper for me to present a detailed\r\nstatement of their provisions. Still, I may be permitted to express the\r\nopinion in advance that they are calculated to promote the agricultural,\r\nmanufacturing, and commercial interests of the country and to secure our\r\njust influence with an adjoining Republic as to whose fortunes and fate we\r\ncan never feel indifferent, whilst at the same time they provide for the\r\npayment of a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claims of\r\nour injured fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAt the period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by a\r\nrevolutionary government existing under what is called the \"Topeka\r\nconstitution.\" Its avowed object was to subdue the Territorial government\r\nby force and to inaugurate what was called the \"Topeka government\" in its\r\nstead. To accomplish this object an extensive military organization was\r\nformed, and its command intrusted to the most violent revolutionary\r\nleaders. Under these circumstances it became my imperative duty to exert\r\nthe whole constitutional power of the Executive to prevent the flames of\r\ncivil war from again raging in Kansas, which in the excited state of the\r\npublic mind, both North and South, might have extended into the neighboring\r\nStates. The hostile parties in Kansas had been inflamed against each other\r\nby emissaries both from the North and the South to a degree of malignity\r\nwithout parallel in our history. To prevent actual collision and to assist\r\nthe civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong detachment of the\r\nArmy was stationed in the Territory, ready to aid the marshal and his\r\ndeputies when lawfully called upon as a posse comitatus in the execution of\r\ncivil and criminal process. Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have\r\nbeen permanently settled without an election by the people.\r\n\r\nThe ballot box is the surest arbiter of disputes among freemen. Under this\r\nconviction every proper effort was employed to induce the hostile parties\r\nto vote at the election of delegates to frame a State constitution, and\r\nafterwards at the election to decide whether Kansas should be a slave or\r\nfree State.\r\n\r\nThe insurgent party refused to vote at either, lest this might be\r\nconsidered a recognition on their part of the Territorial government\r\nestablished by Congress. A better spirit, however, seemed soon after to\r\nprevail, and the two parties met face to face at the third election, held\r\non the first Monday of January, 1858, for members of the legislature and\r\nState officers under the Lecompton constitution. The result was the triumph\r\nof the antislavery party at the polls. This decision of the ballot box\r\nproved clearly that this party were in the majority, and removed the danger\r\nof civil war. From that time we have heard little or nothing of the Topeka\r\ngovernment, and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was\r\nthen at an end.\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton constitution, which had been thus recognized at this State\r\nelection by the votes of both political parties in Kansas, was transmitted\r\nto me with the request that I should present it to Congress. This I could\r\nnot have refused to do without violating my clearest and strongest\r\nconvictions of duty. The constitution and all the proceedings which\r\npreceded and followed its formation were fair and regular on their face. I\r\nthen believed, and experience has proved, that the interests of the people\r\nof Kansas would have been best consulted by its admission as a State into\r\nthe Union, especially as the majority within a brief period could have\r\namended the constitution according to their will and pleasure. If fraud\r\nexisted in all or any of these proceedings, it was not for the President\r\nbut for Congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud and\r\nwhat ought to be its consequences. If at the first two elections the\r\nmajority refused to vote, it can not be pretended that this refusal to\r\nexercise the elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly held\r\nunder lawful authority, even if they had not subsequently voted at the\r\nthird election. It is true that the whole constitution had not been\r\nsubmitted to the people, as I always desired; but the precedents are\r\nnumerous of the admission of States into the Union without such submission.\r\nIt would not comport with my present purpose to review the proceedings of\r\nCongress upon the Lecompton constitution. It is sufficient to observe that\r\ntheir final action has removed the last vestige of serious revolutionary\r\ntroubles. The desperate hand recently assembled under a notorious outlaw in\r\nthe southern portion of the Territory to resist the execution of the laws\r\nand to plunder peaceful citizens will, I doubt not be speedily subdued and\r\nbrought to justice.\r\n\r\nHad I treated the Lecompton constitution as a nullity and refused to\r\ntransmit it to Congress, it is not difficult to imagine, whilst recalling\r\nthe position of the country at that moment, what would have been the\r\ndisastrous consequences, both in and out of the Territory, from such a\r\ndereliction of duty on the part of the Executive.\r\n\r\nPeace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah, which at the\r\ncommencement of my Administration was in a state of open rebellion. This\r\nwas the more dangerous, as the people, animated by a fanatical spirit and\r\nintrenched within their distant mountain fastnesses, might have made a long\r\nand formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it was necessary to bring\r\nthem into subjection to the Constitution and the laws. Sound policy,\r\ntherefore, as well as humanity, required that this object should if\r\npossible be accomplished without the effusion of blood. This could only be\r\neffected by sending a military force into the Territory sufficiently strong\r\nto convince the people that resistance would be hopeless, and at the same\r\ntime to offer them a pardon for past offenses on condition of immediate\r\nsubmission to the Government. This policy was pursued with eminent success,\r\nand the only cause for regret is the heavy expenditure required to march a\r\nlarge detachment of the Army to that remote region and to furnish it\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nUtah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet, and the military force has\r\nbeen withdrawn, except that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians in\r\ncheck and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to our Pacific\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nIn my first annual message I promised to employ my best exertions in\r\ncooperation with Congress to reduce the expenditures of the Government\r\nwithin the limits of a wise and judicious economy. An overflowing Treasury\r\nhad produced habits of prodigality and extravagance which could only be\r\ngradually corrected. The work required both time and patience. I applied\r\nmyself diligently to this task from the beginning and was aided by the able\r\nand energetic efforts of the heads of the different Executive Departments.\r\nThe result of our labors in this good cause did not appear in the sum total\r\nof our expenditures for the first two years, mainly in consequence of the\r\nextraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred in the Utah expedition and\r\nthe very large amount of the contingent expenses of Congress during this\r\nperiod. These greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the members. For the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1858, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to\r\n$1,490,214, the contingent expenses rose to $2,093,309.79; and for the year\r\nending June 30, 1859, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to $859,093.66,\r\nthe contingent expenses amounted to $1,431,565.78. I am happy, however, to\r\nbe able to inform you that during the last fiscal year, ending June 30,\r\n1860, the total expenditures of the Government in all its\r\nbranches--legislative, executive, and judicial--exclusive of the public\r\ndebt, were reduced to the sum of $55,402,465.46. This conclusively appears\r\nfrom the books of the Treasury. In the year ending June 30, 1858, the total\r\nexpenditure, exclusive of the public debt, amounted to $71,901,129.77, and\r\nthat for the year ending June 30, 1859, to $66,346,226.13. Whilst the books\r\nof the Treasury show an actual expenditure of $59,848,474.72 for the year\r\nending June 30, 1860, including $1,040,667.71 for the contingent expenses\r\nof Congress, there must be deducted from this amount the sum of\r\n$4,296,009.26, with the interest upon it of $150,000, appropriated by the\r\nact of February 15, 1860, \"for the purpose of supplying the deficiency in\r\nthe revenues and defraying the expenses of the Post-Office Department for\r\nthe year ending June 30, 1859.\" This sum therefore justly chargeable to the\r\nyear 1859, must be deducted from the sum of $59,848,474.72 in order to\r\nascertain the expenditure for the year ending June 30, 1860, which leaves a\r\nbalance for the expenditures of that year of $55,402,465.46. The interest\r\non the public debt, including Treasury notes, for the same fiscal year,\r\nending June 30, 1860, amounted to $3,177,314.62, which, added to the above\r\nsum of $55,402,465.46, makes the aggregate of $58,579,780.08.\r\n\r\nIt ought in justice to be observed that several of the estimates from the\r\nDepartments for the year ending June 30, 1860, were reduced by Congress\r\nbelow what was and still is deemed compatible with the public interest.\r\nAllowing a liberal margin of $2,500,000 for this reduction and for other\r\ncauses, it may be safely asserted that the sum of $61,000,000, or, at the\r\nmost, $62,000,000, is amply sufficient to administer the Government and to\r\npay the interest on the public debt, unless contingent events should\r\nhereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary.\r\n\r\nThis result has been attained in a considerable degree by the care\r\nexercised by the appropriate Departments in entering into public contracts.\r\nI have myself never interfered with the award of any such contract, except\r\nin a single case, with the Colonization Society, deeming it advisable to\r\ncast the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the\r\nDepartment, with the general instruction that these contracts should always\r\nbe given to the lowest and best bidder. It has ever been my opinion that\r\npublic contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage to be conferred\r\nupon personal or political favorites, but that in all such cases a public\r\nofficer is bound to act for the Government as a prudent individual would\r\nact for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction I communicate the fact that since the date of\r\nmy last annual message not a single slave has been imported into the United\r\nStates in violation of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This\r\nstatement is rounded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the\r\nsubject. Indeed, the spirit which prevailed some time since among a portion\r\nof our fellow-citizens in favor of this trade seems to have entirely\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\nI also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exists against\r\nthe crime of setting on foot military expeditions within the limits of the\r\nUnited States to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of\r\nunoffending States with whom we are at peace. In this respect a happy\r\nchange has been effected since the commencement of my Administration. It\r\nsurely ought to be the prayer of every Christian and patriot that such\r\nexpeditions may never again receive countenance in our country or depart\r\nfrom our shores.\r\n\r\nIt would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest\r\ncommendation to my former recommendations in favor of the Pacific railroad;\r\nof the grant of power to the President to employ the naval force in the\r\nvicinity for the protection of the lives and property of our\r\nfellow-citizens passing in transit over the different Central American\r\nroutes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations, and also to\r\nprotect American merchant vessels, their crews and cargoes, against violent\r\nand unlawful seizure and confiscation in the ports of Mexico and the South\r\nAmerican Republics when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary\r\ncondition. It is my settled conviction that without such a power we do not\r\nafford that protection to those engaged in the commerce of the country\r\nwhich they have a right to demand.\r\n\r\nI again recommend to Congress the passage of a law, in pursuance of the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution, appointing a day certain previous to the\r\n4th March in each year of an odd number for the election of Representatives\r\nthroughout all the States. A similar power has already been exercised, with\r\ngeneral approbation, in the appointment of the same day throughout the\r\nUnion for holding the election of electors for President and Vice-President\r\nof the United States. My attention was earnestly directed to this subject\r\nfrom the fact that the Thirty-fifth Congress terminated on the 3d March,\r\n1859, without making the necessary appropriation for the service of the\r\nPost-Office Department. I was then forced to consider the best remedy for\r\nthis omission, and an immediate call of the present Congress was the\r\nnatural resort. Upon inquiry, however, I ascertained that fifteen out of\r\nthe thirty-three States composing the Confederacy were without\r\nRepresentatives, and that consequently these fifteen States would be\r\ndisfranchised by such a call. These fifteen States will be in the same\r\ncondition on the 4th March next. Ten of them can not elect Representatives,\r\naccording to existing State laws, until different periods, extending from\r\nthe beginning of August next until the months of October and November. In\r\nmy last message I gave warning that in a time of sudden and alarming danger\r\nthe salvation of our institutions might depend upon the power of the\r\nPresident immediately to assemble a full Congress to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nIt is now quite evident that the financial necessities of the Government\r\nwill require a modification of the tariff during your present session for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to\r\nreiterate the recommendation contained in my last two annual messages in\r\nfavor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem duties on all imported\r\narticles to which these can be properly applied. From long observation and\r\nexperience I am convinced that specific duties are necessary, both to\r\nprotect the revenue and to secure to our manufacturing interests that\r\namount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nAs an abstract proposition it may be admitted that ad valorem duties would\r\nin theory be the most just and equal. But if the experience of this and of\r\nall other commercial nations has demonstrated that such duties can not be\r\nassessed and collected without great frauds upon the revenue, then it is\r\nthe part of wisdom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from the very\r\nnature of an ad valorem duty this must be the result. Under it the\r\ninevitable consequence is that foreign goods will be entered at less than\r\ntheir true value. The Treasury will therefore lose the duty on the\r\ndifference between their real and fictitious value, and to this extent we\r\nare defrauded.\r\n\r\nThe temptations which ad valorem duties present to a dishonest importer are\r\nirresistible. His object is to pass his goods through the custom-house at\r\nthe very lowest valuation necessary to save them from confiscation. In this\r\nhe too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers.\r\nHence the resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser and another for\r\nthe custom-house, and to other expedients to defraud the Government. The\r\nhonest importer produces his invoice to the collector, stating the actual\r\nprice at which he purchased the articles abroad. Not so the dishonest\r\nimporter and the agent of the foreign manufacturer. And here it may be\r\nobserved that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported from\r\nabroad are consigned for sale to commission merchants, who are mere agents\r\nemployed by the manufacturers. In such cases no actual sale has been made\r\nto fix their value. The foreign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, prepares\r\nan invoice of the goods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowest\r\nrate necessary to escape detection. In this manner the dishonest importer\r\nand the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest\r\nmerchant. They are thus enabled to undersell the fair trader and drive him\r\nfrom the market. In fact the operation of this system has already driven\r\nfrom the pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and\r\nconscientious merchants whose character throughout the world is the pride\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for these evils is to be found in specific duties, so far as\r\nthis may be practicable. They dispense with any inquiry at the custom-house\r\ninto the actual cost or value of the article, and it pays the precise\r\namount of duty previously fixed by law. They present no temptations to the\r\nappraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might by\r\nundervaluation in a few cases render themselves independent.\r\n\r\nBesides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in the\r\nConstitution that \"no preference shall be given by any regulation of\r\ncommerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another.\" Under\r\nour ad valorem system such preferences are to some extent inevitable, and\r\ncomplaints have often been made that the spirit of this provision has been\r\nviolated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at one port than at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAn impression strangely enough prevails to some extent that specific duties\r\nare necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Great\r\nBritain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at\r\nthe present moment collected under a system of specific duties. It is a\r\nstriking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of January\r\n23, 1860, between France and England one of the articles provides that the\r\nad valorem duties which it imposes shall be converted into specific duties\r\nwithin six months from its date, and these are to be ascertained by making\r\nan average of the prices for six months previous to that time. The reverse\r\nof the propositions would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger\r\namount of revenue would be collected by merely converting the ad valorem\r\nduties of a tariff into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the\r\nrevenue would be increased, and in the same proportion the specific duty\r\nmight be diminished.\r\n\r\nSpecific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the incidental\r\nprotection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to\r\nthis surely no person would object. The framers of the existing tariff have\r\ngone further, and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor of large\r\nand useful branches of our manufactures, not by raising the rate of duty\r\nupon the importation of similar articles from abroad, but, what is the same\r\nin effect, by admitting articles free of duty which enter into the\r\ncomposition of their fabrics.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system it has been often truly remarked that this\r\nincidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most and\r\nincreases when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which\r\nalways operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to\r\nsimilar fluctuations. Instead of approaching a steady standard, as would be\r\nthe case under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with the\r\nsinking and rising prices of articles in foreign countries. It would not be\r\ndifficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would\r\nafford additional stability both to our revenue and our manufactures and\r\nwithout injury or injustice to any interest of the country. This might be\r\naccomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a\r\nseries of years at the place of exportation and by simply converting the\r\nrate of ad valorem duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for revenue\r\npurposes into the form of a specific duty. Such an arrangement could not\r\ninjure the consumer. If he should pay a greater amount of duty one year,\r\nthis would be counterbalanced by a lesser amount the next, and in the end\r\nthe aggregate would be the same.\r\n\r\nI desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition of the\r\nTreasury, so ably and clearly presented by the Secretary in his report to\r\nCongress, and to recommend that measures be promptly adopted to enable it\r\nto discharge its pressing obligations. The other recommendations of the\r\nreport are well worthy of your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the Secretaries of War, of\r\nthe Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. The\r\nrecommendations and suggestions which they contain are highly valuable and\r\ndeserve your careful attention.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General details the circumstances under which\r\nCornelius Vanderbilt, on my request, agreed in the month of July last to\r\ncarry the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Had he not\r\nthus acted this important intercommunication must have been suspended, at\r\nleast for a season. The Postmaster-General had no power to make him any\r\nother compensation than the postages on the mail matter which he might\r\ncarry. It was known at the time that these postages would fall far short of\r\nan adequate compensation, as well as of the sum which the same service had\r\npreviously cost the Government. Mr. Vanderbilt, in a commendable spirit,\r\nwas willing to rely upon the justice of Congress to make up the deficiency,\r\nand I therefore recommend that an appropriation may be granted for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nI should do great injustice to the Attorney-General were I to omit the\r\nmention of his distinguished services in the measures adopted and\r\nprosecuted by him for the defense of the Government against numerous and\r\nunfounded claims to land in California purporting to have been made by the\r\nMexican Government previous to the treaty of cession. The successful\r\nopposition to these claims has saved the United States public property\r\nworth many millions of dollars and to individuals holding title under them\r\nto at least an equal amount.\r\n\r\nIt has been represented to me from sources which I deem reliable that the\r\ninhabitants in several portions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a\r\nstate of starvation on account of the almost total failure of their crops,\r\nwhilst the harvests in every other portion of the country have been\r\nabundant. The prospect before them for the approaching winter is well\r\ncalculated to enlist the sympathies of every heart. The destitution appears\r\nto be so general that it can not be relieved by private contributions, and\r\nthey are in such indigent circumstances as to be unable to purchase the\r\nnecessaries of life for themselves. I refer the subject to Congress. If any\r\nconstitutional measure for their relief can be devised, I would recommend\r\nits adoption.\r\n\r\nI cordially commend to your favorable regard the interests of the people of\r\nthis District. They are eminently entitled to your consideration,\r\nespecially since, unlike the people of the States, they can appeal to no\r\ngovernment except that of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by James Buchanan",
