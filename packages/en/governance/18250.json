Mr. Temple Scott, who is preparing the new\r\n     edition of Swift's Prose Works, has begun well, his first volume is\r\n     marked by care and knowledge. He has scrupulously collated his\r\n     texts with the first or the best early editions, and has given\r\n     various readings in the footnotes.... Mr. Temple Scott may well be\r\n     congratulated on his skill and judgment as a commentator.... He has\r\n     undoubtedly earned the gratitude of all admirers of our greatest\r\n     satirist, and all students of vigorous, masculine, and exact\r\n     English.\"--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n     \"The volume is an agreeable one to hold and to refer to, and the\r\n     notes and apparatus are, on the whole, exact.

D.\r\n\r\nEDITED BY\r\n\r\nTEMPLE SCOTT.\r\n\r\nVOL. VII\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL AND POLITICAL TRACTS--IRISH\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nGEORGE BELL AND SONS\r\n1905\r\nCHISWICK PRESS. CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO. TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE,\r\nLONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSwift took up his permanent residence in the Irish capital in 1714. The\r\nHarley Administration had fallen never to rise again. Harley himself was\r\na prisoner in the Tower, and Bolingbroke a voluntary exile in France,\r\nand an open adherent of the Pretender. Swift came to Dublin to be met by\r\nthe jeers of the populace, the suspicion of the government officials,\r\nand the polite indifference of his clerical colleagues. He had time\r\nenough now in which to reflect and employ his brain powers. For several\r\nyears he kept himself altogether to his duties as Dean of the Cathedral\r\nof St. Patrick's, only venturing his pen in letters to dear friends in\r\nEngland--to Pope, Atterbury, Lady Howard. His private relations with\r\nMiss Hester Vanhomrigh came to a climax, also, during this period, and\r\nhis peculiar intimacy with \"Stella\" Johnson took the definite shape in\r\nwhich we now know it.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in debt to his predecessor, Sterne, for a large and\r\ncomfortless house and for the cost of his own installation into his\r\noffice. The money he was to have received (£1,000) to defray these\r\nexpenses, from the last administration, was now, on its fall, kept back\r\nfrom him. Swift had these encumbrances to pay off and he had his Chapter\r\nto see to. He did both in characteristic fashion. By dint of almost\r\npenurious saving he accomplished the former and the latter he managed\r\nautocratically and with good sense. His connection with Oxford and\r\nBolingbroke had been of too intimate a nature for those in power to\r\nignore him. Indeed, his own letters to Knightley Chetwode[1] show us\r\nthat he was in great fear of arrest. But there is now no doubt that the\r\ntreasonable relations between Harley and St. John and the Pretender were\r\na great surprise to Swift when they were discovered. He himself had\r\nalways been an ardent supporter of the Protestant succession, and his\r\nwritings during his later period in Ireland constantly emphasize this\r\nattitude of his--almost too much so.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland as Swift found it in 1714, and as he had known\r\nof it even before that time, was of a kind to rouse a temper like his to\r\nquick and indignant expression. Even as early as the spring of 1716 we\r\nfind him unable to restrain himself, and in his letter to Atterbury of\r\nApril 18th we catch the spirit which, four years later, showed itself in\r\n\"The Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufactures\" and the\r\n\"Drapier's Letters,\" and culminated in 1729 in the terrible \"Modest\r\nProposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from being a Burthen\r\nto their Parents.\" To Atterbury he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate with England for joining with us here in the fellowship\r\nof slavery. It is not so terrible a thing as you imagine: we have long\r\nlived under it: and whenever you are disposed to know how to behave\r\nyourself in your new condition, you need go no further than me for a\r\ndirector. But, because we are resolved to go beyond you, we have\r\ntransmitted a bill to England, to be returned here, giving the\r\nGovernment and six of the Council power for three years to imprison whom\r\nthey please for three months, without any trial or examination: and I\r\nexpect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be\r\nexecuted.\"\r\n\r\nWriting to Archdeacon Walls[2] (May 5th, 1715) of the people in power,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"They shall be deceived as far as my power reaches, and shall not find\r\nme altogether so great a cully as they would willingly make me.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time England was beginning to initiate a new method for what it\r\ncalled the proper government of Ireland. Hitherto it had tried the plan\r\nof setting one party in the country against another; but now a new party\r\nwas called into being, known as the \"English party.\" This party had\r\nnothing to do with the Irish national spirit, and any man, no matter how\r\ncapable, who held by such a national spirit, was to be set aside. There\r\nwas to be no Irish party or parties as such--there was to be only the\r\nEnglish party governing Ireland in the interests of England. It was the\r\nbeginning of a government which led to the appointment of such a man as\r\nPrimate Boulter, who simply ruled Ireland behind the Lord Lieutenant\r\n(who was but a figurehead) for and on behalf of the King of England's\r\nadvisers. Irish institutions, Irish ideas, Irish traditions, the Irish\r\nChurch, Irish schools, Irish language and literature, Irish trade,\r\nmanufactures, commerce, agriculture--all were to be subordinated to\r\nEngland's needs and England's demands. At any cost almost, these were to\r\nbe made subservient to the interests of England. So well was this plan\r\ncarried out, that Ireland found itself being governed by a small English\r\nclique and its Houses of Parliament a mere tool in the clique's hands.\r\nThe Parliament no longer represented the national will, since it did\r\nreally nothing but ratify what the English party asked for, or what the\r\nKing's ministers in England instructed should be made law.\r\n\r\nIrish manufactures were ruined by legislation; the commerce of Ireland\r\nwas destroyed by the same means; her schools became practically\r\npenitentiaries to the Catholic children, who were compelled to receive a\r\nProtestant instruction; her agriculture was degraded to the degree that\r\ncattle could not be exported nor the wool sold or shipped from her own\r\nports to other countries; her towns swarmed with beggars and thieves,\r\nforced there by the desolation which prevailed in the country districts,\r\nwhere people starved by the wayside, and where those who lived barely\r\nkept body and soul together to pay the rents of the absentee landlords.\r\n\r\nSwift has himself, in the pamphlets printed in the present volume, given\r\na fairly accurate and no exaggerated account of the miserable condition\r\nof his country at this time; and his writings are amply corroborated by\r\nother men who might be considered less passionate and more temperate.\r\n\r\nThe people had become degraded through the evil influence of a\r\ncontemptuous and spendthrift landlord class, who considered the tenant\r\nin no other light than as a rent-paying creature. As Roman Catholics\r\nthey found themselves the social inferiors of the ruling Protestant\r\nclass--the laws had placed them in that invidious position. They were\r\npractically without any defence. They were ignorant, poor, and\r\nhalf-starved. Thriftless, like their landlords, they ate up in the\r\nautumn what harvests they gathered, and begged for their winter's\r\nsupport. Adultery and incest were common and bred a body of lawless\r\ncreatures, who herded together like wild beasts and became dangerous\r\npests.\r\n\r\nSwift knew all this. He had time, between the years 1714 and 1720, to\r\nfind it out, even if he had not known of it before. But the condition\r\nwas getting worse, and his heart filled, as he told Pope in 1728, with a\r\n\"perfect rage and resentment\" at \"the mortifying sight of slavery,\r\nfolly, and baseness about me, among which I am forced to live.\"\r\n\r\nHe commenced what might be called a campaign of attack in 1720, with the\r\npublication of his tract entitled, \"A Modest Proposal for the Universal\r\nUse of Irish Manufactures.\" As has been pointed out in the notes\r\nprefixed to the pamphlets in the present volume, England had,\r\napparently, gone to work systematically to ruin Irish manufactures. They\r\nseemed to threaten ruin to English industries; at least so the people in\r\nEngland thought. The pernicious legislation began in the reign of\r\nCharles II. and continued in that of William III. The Irish manufacturer\r\nwas not permitted to export his products and found a precarious\r\nlivelihood in a contraband trade. Swift's \"Proposal\" is one of\r\nretaliation. Since England will not allow Ireland to send out her goods,\r\nlet the people of Ireland use them, and let them join together and\r\ndetermine to use nothing from England. Everything that came from England\r\nshould be burned, except the people and the coal. If England had the\r\nright to prevent the exportation of the goods made in Ireland, she had\r\nnot the right to prevent the people of Ireland from choosing what they\r\nshould wear. The temper of the pamphlet was mild in the extreme; but the\r\ngoverning officials saw in it dangerous symptoms. The pamphlet was\r\nstigmatized as libellous and seditious, and the writer as attempting to\r\ndisunite the two nations. The printer was brought to trial, and the\r\npamphlet obtained a tremendous circulation. Although the jury acquitted\r\nthe printer, Chief Justice Whitshed, who had, as Swift puts it, \"so\r\nquick an understanding, that he resolved, if possible, to outdo his\r\norders,\" sent the jury back nine times to reconsider their verdict. He\r\neven declared solemnly that the author's design was to bring in the\r\nPretender. This cry of bringing in the Pretender was raised on any and\r\nevery occasion, and has been well ridiculed by Swift in his \"Examination\r\nof Certain Abuses and Corruptions in the City of Dublin.\" The end of\r\nWhitshed's persecution could have been foretold--it fizzled out in a\r\n_nolle prosequi_.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this interesting commencement came the lengthened agitation\r\nagainst Wood's Halfpence to which we owe the remarkable series of\r\nwritings known now as the \"Drapier's Letters.\" These are fully discussed\r\nin the volume preceding this. But Swift found other channels in which to\r\ncontinue rousing the spirit of the people, and refreshing it to further\r\neffort. The mania for speculation which Law's schemes had given birth\r\nto, reached poor Ireland also. People thought there might be found a\r\nscheme on similar lines by which Ireland might move to prosperity. A\r\nBank project was initiated for the purpose of assisting small tradesmen.\r\nBut a scheme that in itself would have been excellent in a prosperous\r\nsociety, could only end in failure in such a community as peopled\r\nIreland. Swift felt this and opposed the plan in his satirical tract,\r\n\"The Swearer's Bank.\" The tract sufficed, for no more was heard of the\r\nNational Bank after the House of Commons rejected it.\r\n\r\nThe thieves and \"roughs\" who infested Dublin came in next for Swift's\r\nattention. In characteristic fashion he seized the occasion of the\r\narrest and execution of one of their leaders to publish a pretended\r\n\"Last Speech and Dying Confession,\" in which he threatened exposure and\r\narrest to the remainder of the gang if they did not make themselves\r\nscarce. The threat had its effect, and the city found itself\r\nconsiderably safer as a consequence.\r\n\r\nHow Swift pounded out his \"rage and resentment\" against English\r\nmisgovernment, may be further read in the \"Story of the Injured Lady,\"\r\nand in the \"Answer\" to that story. The Injured Lady is Ireland, who\r\ntells her lover, England, of her attractions, and upbraids him on his\r\nconduct towards her. In the \"Answer\" Swift tells the Lady what she ought\r\nto do, and hardly minces matters. Let her show the right spirit, he says\r\nto her, and she will find there are many gentlemen who will support her\r\nand champion her cause.\r\n\r\nThen came the plain, pathetic, and truthful recital of the \"Short View\r\nof the State of Ireland\"--a pamphlet of but a few pages and yet terribly\r\neffective. As an historical document it takes rank with the experiences\r\nof the clergymen, Skelton and Jackson, as well as the more dispassionate\r\nwritings of contemporary historians. It is frequently cited by Lecky in\r\nhis \"History of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Swift had so far left undone, either from political reasons or from\r\nmotives of personal restraint, he completed in what may, without\r\nexaggeration, be called his satirical masterpiece--the \"Modest Proposal\r\nfor Preventing the Children of Poor People from being a Burthen to their\r\nParents.\" Nothing comparable to this piece of writing is to be found in\r\nany literature; while the mere fact that it came into being must stand\r\nas one of the deadliest indictments against England's misrule.\r\nGovernments and rulers have been satirized time and again, but no\r\nsimilar condition of things has existed with a Swift living at the time,\r\nto observe and comment on them. The tract itself must be read with a\r\nknowledge of the Irish conditions then prevailing; its temper is so calm\r\nand restrained that a reader unacquainted with the conditions might be\r\nmisled and think that the author of \"Gulliver's Travels\" was indulging\r\nhimself in one of his grim jokes. That it was not a joke its readers at\r\nthe time well knew, and many of them also knew how great was the\r\nindignation which raged in Swift's heart to stir him to so unprecedented\r\nan expression of contempt. He had, as he himself said, raged and stormed\r\nonly to find himself stupefied. In the \"Modest Proposal\" he changed his\r\ntune and\r\n\r\n      ... with raillery to nettle,\r\n  Set your thoughts upon their mettle.\r\n\r\nSwift has been censured for the cold-blooded cynicism of this piece of\r\nwriting, but these censurers have entirely misunderstood both his motive\r\nand his meaning. We wonder how any one could take seriously a proposal\r\nfor breeding children for food purposes, and our wonder grows in\r\nreflecting on an inability to see through the thin veil of satire which\r\nbarely hid an impeachment of a ruling nation by the mere statement of\r\nthe proposal itself. That a Frenchman should so misunderstand it (as a\r\nFrenchman did) may not surprise us, but that any Englishman should so\r\ntake it argues an utter absence of humour and a total ignorance of Irish\r\nconditions at the time the tract was written. But history has justified\r\nSwift, and it is to his writings, rather than to the many works written\r\nby more commonplace observers, that we now turn for the true story of\r\nIreland's wrongs, and the real sources of her continued attitude of\r\nhostility towards England's government of her.\r\n\r\nIt has been well noted by one of Swift's biographers, that for a\r\nthousand readers which the \"Modest Proposal\" has found, there is perhaps\r\nonly one who is acquainted with Swift's \"Answer to the Craftsman.\" It\r\nmay be that the title is misleading or uninviting; but there is no\r\nquestion that this tract may well stand by the side of the \"Modest\r\nProposal,\" both for force of argument and pungency of satire. In its way\r\nand within the limits of its more restricted argument it is one of the\r\nablest pieces of writing Swift has given us on behalf of Irish liberty.\r\n\r\nThe title of Irish patriot which Swift obtained was not sought for by\r\nhim. It was given him mainly for the part he played, and for the success\r\nhe achieved in the Wood's patent agitation. He was acclaimed the\r\nchampion of the people, because he had stopped the foolish manoeuvres\r\nof the Walpole Administration. So to label him, however, would be to do\r\nhim an injustice. In truth, he would have championed the cause of\r\nliberty and justice in any country in which he lived, had he found\r\nliberty and justice wanting there. The matter of the copper coinage\r\npatent was but a peg for him to hang arguments which applied almost\r\neverywhere. It was not to the particular arguments but to the spirit\r\nwhich gave them life that we must look for the true value of Swift's\r\nwork. And that spirit--honest, brave, strong for the right--is even more\r\nabundantly displayed in the writings we have just considered. They\r\nwitness to his championship of liberty and justice, to his impeachment\r\nof selfish office-holders and a short-sighted policy. They gave him his\r\nposition as the chief among the citizens of Dublin to whom he spoke as\r\ncounsel and adviser. They proclaim him as the friend of the common\r\npeople, to whom he was more than the Dean of St. Patrick's. He may have\r\nbegun his work impelled by a hatred for Whiggish principles; but he\r\nundoubtedly accomplished it in the spirit of a broad-minded and\r\nfar-seeing statesman. The pressing needs of Ireland were too urgent and\r\ncrying for him to permit his personal dislike of the Irish natives to\r\ndivert him from his humanitarian efforts. If he hated the beggar he was\r\nready with his charity. The times in which he lived were not times in\r\nwhich, as he told the freemen of Dublin, \"to expect such an exalted\r\ndegree of virtue from mortal men.\" He was speaking to them of the\r\nimpossibility of office-holders being independent of the government\r\nunder which they held their offices. \"Blazing stars,\" he said, \"are much\r\nmore frequently seen than such heroical virtues.\" As the Irish people\r\nwere governed by such men he advised them strongly to choose a\r\nparliamentary representative from among themselves. He insisted on the\r\nvalue of their collected voice, their unanimity of effort, a\r\nconsciousness of their understanding of what they wished to bring about.\r\n\"Be independent\" is the text of all his writings to the people of\r\nIreland. It is idle to appeal to England's clemency or England's\r\njustice. It is vain to evolve social schemes and Utopian dreams. The\r\nremedy lay in their own hands, if the people only realized it.\r\n\r\n\"Violent zeal for truth,\" Swift noted in one of his \"Thoughts on\r\nReligion,\" \"has a hundred to one odds to be either petulancy, ambition,\r\nor pride.\" Examining Swift's writings on behalf of Ireland by the\r\ncriterion provided in this statement, we must acquit him entirely of\r\nmisusing any of these qualities. If he were bitter or scornful, he was\r\ncertainly not petulant. No one has written with more justice or\r\ncoolness; the temper is hot but it is the heat of a conscious and\r\ncollected indignation. If he wrote or spoke in a manner somewhat\r\noverbearing, it was not because of ambition, since he was now long past\r\nhis youth and his mind had become settled in a fairly complacent\r\nacceptance of his position. If he had pride, and he undoubtedly had, it\r\nwas nowhere obtruded for personal aggrandizement, but rather by way of\r\nemphasizing the dignity of citizenship, and the value of self-respect.\r\nAssuredly, in these Irish tracts, Swift was no violent zealot for truth.\r\nIndeed, it is a high compliment to pay him, to say that we wonder he\r\nrestrained himself as he did.\r\n\r\nSwift, however, had his weakness also, and it lay, as weaknesses\r\ngenerally lie, very close to his strength. Swift's fault as a thinker\r\nwas the outcome of his intellectuality--he was too purely intellectual.\r\nHe set little store on the emotional side of human nature; his appeal\r\nwas always to the reason. He hated cant, and any expression of emotion\r\nappealed to him as cant. He could not bear to be seen saying his\r\nprayers; his acts of charity were surreptitious and given in secret with\r\nan affectation of cynicism, so that they might veil the motive which\r\nimpelled them. It may have been pride or a dislike to be considered\r\nsentimental; but his attitude owed its spring to a genuine faith in his\r\nown thought. If Swift had one pride more than another, it lay in a\r\nconsciousness of his own superiority over his fellow-mortals. It was the\r\npride of intellect and a belief that man showed himself best by\r\nfollowing the judgements of the reason. His disgust with people was born\r\nof their unreasonable selfishness, their instinctive greed and rapacity,\r\ntheir blind stupidity, all which resulted for them in so much injustice.\r\nHad they been reasonable, he would have argued, they would have been\r\nbetter and happier. The sentiments and the passions were impulsive, and\r\ntherefore unreasonable. Swift seemed to have no faith in their elevation\r\nto a higher intellectual plane, and yet he often roused them by his very\r\nappeals to reason. His eminently successful \"Drapier's Letters\" are a\r\ncase in point. Yet we question if Swift were not himself surprised at\r\ntheir effect. He knew his power later when he threatened the Archbishop\r\nof Armagh, but he, no doubt, credited the result to his own arguments,\r\nand not to the passions he had aroused. His sense of justice was the\r\nstrongest, and it was through that sense that the condition of the\r\npeople of Ireland appealed to him. He forgot, or he did not see that the\r\nvery passion in himself was of prime importance, since it was really to\r\nit that his own efforts were due. The fine flower of imagination never\r\nblossomed in Swift. He was neither prophet nor poet; but he was a great\r\nleader, a splendid captain, a logical statesman. It is to this lack of\r\nimagination that we must look for the real root of his cynical humour\r\nand satirical temper. A more imaginative man than Swift with much less\r\npower would have better appreciated the weaknesses of humanity and made\r\nallowances for them. He would never have held them up to ridicule and\r\ncontempt, but would rather have laid stress on those instincts of honour\r\nand nobility which the most ignorant and least reasoning possess in some\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the work Swift did, and comparing its effect at the time\r\nwith the current esteem in which he is held in the present day, we shall\r\nfind that his reputation has altogether changed. In his own day, and\r\nespecially during his life in Ireland, his work was special, and brought\r\nhim a special repute. He was a party's advocate and the people's friend.\r\nHis literary output, distinguished though it was, was of secondary\r\nimportance compared with the purpose for which it was accomplished. He\r\nwas the friend of Harley, the champion of the Protestant Church, the\r\nIrish patriot, the enemy of Whiggism, the opponent of Nonconformity.\r\nTo-day all these phrases mean little or nothing to those who know of\r\nSwift as the author of \"A Tale of a Tub,\" and \"Gulliver's Travels.\"\r\nSwift is now accepted as a great satirist, and admired for the wonderful\r\nknowledge he shows of the failings and weaknesses of human nature. He is\r\nadmired but never loved. The particular occasions in his life-time\r\nwhich urged him to rouse passions mean nothing to us; they have lost the\r\naroma of his just indignation and are become historical events. What is\r\nleft of him for us is the result of cold analysis and almost heartless\r\ncontempt. How different would it have been had Swift allied his great\r\ngift as a writer to such a spirit as breathes in the Sermon on the\r\nMount! But to wish this is perhaps as foolish as to expect dates to grow\r\non thistles. We must accept what is given us, and see that we, at any\r\nrate, steer clear of the dangers mapped out for us by the travellers of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor takes this opportunity to thank Mr. G.

The Godolphin ministry\r\n     was anxious to repeal the Test Act in Ireland, as a concession to\r\n     the Presbyterians who had made themselves prominent by their\r\n     expressions of loyalty to William and the Protestant succession. In\r\n     this particular year also (1708), rumours of an invasion gave them\r\n     another opportunity to send in loyal addresses. In reality,\r\n     however, the endeavour to try the repeal in Ireland, was in the\r\n     nature of a test, and Swift ridiculed the attempt as being like to\r\n     \"that of a discreet physician, who first gives a new medicine to a\r\n     dog, before he prescribes it to a human creature.\" It seems that\r\n     Swift had been consulted by Somers on the question of the repeal,\r\n     and had given his opinion very frankly. The letter to Archbishop\r\n     King, revealing this, contains some bitter remarks about \"a certain\r\n     lawyer of Ireland.\" The lawyer was Speaker Brodrick, afterwards\r\n     Lord Midleton, who was enthusiastic for the repeal. The present\r\n     letter gives a very clear idea of what Swift thought should be a\r\n     Speaker's duties both as the chairman of the House and as related\r\n     to this particular measure of the Test.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present reprint is based on the original manuscript\r\n     in Swift's handwriting; but as this was found to be somewhat\r\n     illegible, it has been collated with the text given in vol. viii.\r\n     of the quarto edition of Swift's collected works, published in\r\n     1765.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, IN IRELAND, UPON THE CHOOSING A NEW\r\nSPEAKER THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYou may easily believe I am not at all surprised at what you tell me,\r\nsince it is but a confirmation of my own conjecture that I sent you last\r\nweek, and made you my reproaches upon it at a venture. It looks\r\nexceeding strange, yet, I believe it to be a great truth, that, in order\r\nto carry a point in your house, the two following circumstances are of\r\ngreat advantage; first, to have an ill cause; and, secondly, to be a\r\nminority. For both these circumstances are extremely apt to unite men,\r\nto make them assiduous in their attendance, watchful of opportunities,\r\nzealous for gaining over proselytes, and often successful; which is not\r\nto be wondered at, when favour and interest are on the side of their\r\nopinion. Whereas, on the contrary, a majority with a good cause are\r\nnegligent and supine. They think it sufficient to declare themselves\r\nupon occasion in favour of their party, but, sailing against the tide of\r\nfavour and preferment, they are easily scattered and driven back. In\r\nshort, they want a common principle to cement, and motive to spirit\r\nthem; For the bare acting upon a principle from the dictates of a good\r\nconscience, or prospect of serving the public, will not go very far\r\nunder the present dispositions of mankind. This was amply verified last\r\nsessions of Parliament, upon occasion of the money bill, the merits of\r\nwhich I shall not pretend to examine. 'Tis enough that, upon the first\r\nnews of its transmission hither, in the form it afterwards appeared, the\r\nmembers, upon discourse with their friends, seemed unanimous against it,\r\nI mean those of both parties, except a few, who were looked upon as\r\npersons ready to go any lengths prescribed them by the court. Yet with\r\nonly a week's canvassing among a very few hands, the bill passed after a\r\nfull debate, by a very great majority; yet, I believe, you will hardly\r\nattempt persuading me, or anybody else, that one man in ten, of those\r\nwho changed their language, were moved by reasons any way affecting the\r\nmerits of the cause, but merely through hope, fear, indolence, or good\r\nmanners. Nay, I have been assured from good hands, that there was still\r\na number sufficient to make a majority against the bill, if they had not\r\napprehended the other side to be secure, and therefore thought it\r\nimprudence, by declaring themselves, to disoblige the government to no\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nReflecting upon this and forty other passages, in the several Houses of\r\nCommons since the Revolution, makes me apt to think there is nothing a\r\nchief governor can be commanded to attempt here wherein he may not\r\nsucceed, with a very competent share of address, and with such\r\nassistance as he will always find ready at his devotion. And therefore I\r\nrepeat what I said at first, that I am not at all surprised at what you\r\ntell me. For, if there had been the least spark of public spirit left,\r\nthose who wished well to their country and its constitution in church\r\nand state, should, upon the first news of the late Speaker's promotion,\r\n(and you and I know it might have been done a great deal sooner) have\r\nimmediately gone together, and consulted about the fittest person to\r\nsucceed him. But, by all I can comprehend, you have been so far from\r\nproceeding thus, that it hardly ever came into any of your heads. And\r\nthe reason you give is the worst in the world: That none offered\r\nthemselves, and you knew not whom to pitch upon. It seems, however, the\r\nother party was more resolved, or at least not so modest: For you say\r\nyour vote is engaged against your opinion, and several gentlemen in my\r\nneighbourhood tell me the same story of themselves; this, I confess, is\r\nof an unusual strain, and a good many steps below any condescensions a\r\ncourt will, I hope, ever require from you. I shall not trouble myself to\r\ninquire who is the person for whom you and others are engaged, or\r\nwhether there be more candidates from that side, than one. You tell me\r\nnothing of either, and I never thought it worth the question to anybody\r\nelse. But, in so weighty an affair, and against your judgment, I cannot\r\nlook upon you as irrevocably determined. Therefore I desire you will\r\ngive me leave to reason with you a little upon the subject, lest your\r\ncompliance, or inadvertency, should put you upon what you may have cause\r\nto repent as long as you live.\r\n\r\nYou know very well, the great business of the high-flying Whigs, at this\r\njuncture, is to endeavour a repeal of the test clause. You know likewise\r\nthat the moderate men, both of High and Low Church, profess to be wholly\r\naverse from this design, as thinking it beneath the policy of common\r\ngardeners to cut down the only hedge that shelters from the north.[3]\r\nNow, I will put the case; If the person to whom you have promised your\r\nvote be one of whom you have the least apprehension that he will promote\r\nor assent to the repealing of that clause, whether it be decent or\r\nproper, he should be the mouth of an assembly, whereof a very great\r\nmajority pretend to abhor his opinion. Can a body, whose mouth and heart\r\nmust go so contrary ways, ever act with sincerity, or hardly with\r\nconsistence? Such a man is no proper vehicle to retain or convey the\r\nsense of the House, which, in so many points of the greatest moment,\r\nwill be directly contrary to his; 'tis full as absurd, as to prefer a\r\nman to a bishopric who denies revealed religion. But it may possibly be\r\na great deal worse. What if the person you design to vote into that\r\nimportant post, should not only be a declared enemy of the sacramental\r\ntest, but should prove to be a solicitor, an encourager, or even a\r\npenner of addresses to complain of it? Do you think it so indifferent a\r\nthing, that a promise of course, the effect of compliance, importunity,\r\nshame of refusing, or any the like motive, shall oblige you past the\r\npower of retracting?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will tell me, as some have already had the weakness to do,\r\nthat it is of little importance to either party to have a Speaker of\r\ntheir side, his business being only to take the sense of the House and\r\nreport it, that you often, at committees, put an able speaker into the\r\nchair on purpose to prevent him from stopping a bill. Why, if it were no\r\nmore than this, I believe I should hardly choose, even among my footmen,\r\nsuch a one to deliver a message, whose interest and opinions led him to\r\nwish it might miscarry. But I remember to have heard old Colonel\r\nBirch[4] of Herefordshire say, that \"he was a very sorry Speaker, whose\r\nsingle vote was not better than fifty common ones.\" I am sure it is\r\nreckoned in England the first great test of the prevalency of either\r\nparty in the House. Sir Thomas Littleton[5] thought, that a House of\r\nCommons with a stinking breath (supposing the Speaker to be the mouth)\r\nwould go near to infect everything within the walls, and a great deal\r\nwithout. It is the smallest part of an able Speaker's business, what he\r\nperforms in the House, at least if he be in with the court, when it is\r\nhard to say how many converts may be made in a circle of dinners, or\r\nprivate cabals. And you and I can easily call to mind a gentleman in\r\nthat station, in England, who, by his own arts and personal credit, was\r\nable to draw over a majority, and change the whole power of a prevailing\r\nside in a nice juncture of affairs, and made a Parliament expire in one\r\nparty who had lived in another.\r\n\r\nI am far from an inclination to multiply party causes, but surely the\r\nbest of us can with very ill grace make that an objection, who have not\r\nbeen so nice in matters of much less importance. Yet I have heard some\r\npersons of both sides gravely deliver themselves in this manner; \"Why\r\nshould we make the choosing a Speaker a party cause? Let us fix upon one\r\nwho is well versed in the practices and methods of parliament.\" And I\r\nbelieve there are too many who would talk at the same rate, if the\r\nquestion were not only about abolishing the sacramental test, but the\r\nsacrament itself.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the principles of the most artful Speaker could have no\r\ninfluence either to obtain or obstruct any point in Parliament, who can\r\nanswer what effects such a choice may produce without doors? 'Tis\r\nobvious how small a matter serves to raise the spirits and hopes of the\r\nDissenters and their high-flying advocates, what lengths they run, what\r\nconclusions they form, and what hopes they entertain. Do they hear of a\r\nnew friend in office? That is encouragement enough to practise the\r\ncity, against the opinion of a majority into an address to the Queen for\r\nrepealing the sacramental test; or issue out their orders to the next\r\nfanatic parson to furbish up his old sermons, and preach and print new\r\nones directly against Episcopacy. I would lay a good wager, that, if the\r\nchoice of a new Speaker succeeds exactly to their liking, we shall see\r\nit soon followed by many new attempts, either in the form of pamphlet,\r\nsermon, or address, to the same, or perhaps more dangerous purposes.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Speaker's office to be only an employment of profit and\r\nhonour, and a step to a better; since it is in your own gift, will you\r\nnot choose to bestow it upon some person whose principles the majority\r\nof you pretends to approve, if it were only to be sure of a worthy man\r\nhereafter in a high station, on the bench or at the bar?\r\n\r\nI confess, if it were a thing possible to be compassed, it would seem\r\nmost reasonable to fill the chair with some person who would be entirely\r\ndevoted to neither party: But, since there are so few of that character,\r\nand those either unqualified or unfriended, I cannot see how a majority\r\nwill answer it to their reputation, to be so ill provided of able\r\npersons, that they must have recourse for a leader to their adversaries,\r\na proceeding of which I never met with above one example, and even that\r\nsucceeded but ill, though it was recommended by an oracle, which advised\r\nsome city in Greece to beg a general from their enemies, who, in scorn,\r\nsent them either a fiddler or a poet, I have forgot which; but so much I\r\nremember, that his conduct was such, as they soon grew weary of him.\r\n\r\nYou pretend to be heartily resolved against repealing the sacramental\r\ntest, yet, at the same time, give the only great employment you have to\r\ndispose of to a person who will take that test against his stomach (by\r\nwhich word I understand many a man's conscience) who earnestly wisheth\r\nit repealed, and will endeavour it to the utmost of his power; so that\r\nthe first action after you meet, will be a sort of contravention to that\r\ntest: And will anybody go further than your practice to judge of your\r\nprinciples?\r\n\r\nAnd now I am upon this subject, I cannot conclude without saying\r\nsomething to a very popular argument against that sacramental test,\r\nwhich may be apt to shake many of those who would otherwise wish well\r\nenough to it. They say it was a new hardship put upon the Dissenters,\r\nwithout any provocation; and, it is plain, could be no way necessary,\r\nbecause we had peaceably lived together so long without it. They add\r\nsome other circumstances of the arts by which it was obtained, and the\r\nperson by whom it was inserted. Surely such people do not consider that\r\nthe penal laws against Dissenters were made wholly ineffectual by the\r\nconnivance and mercy of the government, so that all employments of the\r\nstate lay as open to them as they did to the best and most legal\r\nsubjects. And what progress they would have made by the advantages of a\r\nlate conjecture, is obvious to imagine; which I take to be a full answer\r\nto that objection.\r\n\r\nI remember, upon the transmission of that bill with the test clause\r\ninserted, the Dissenters and their partisans, among other topics, spoke\r\nmuch of the good effects produced by the lenity of the government, that\r\nthe Presbyterians were grown very inconsiderable in their number and\r\nquality, and would daily come into the church, if we did not fright them\r\nfrom it by new severities. When the act was passed, they presently\r\nchanged their style, and raised a clamour, through both kingdoms, of the\r\ngreat numbers of considerable gentry who were laid aside, and could no\r\nlonger serve their queen and country; which hyperbolical way of\r\nreckoning, when it came to be melted down into truth, amounted to about\r\nfifteen country justices, most of them of the lowest size, for estate,\r\nquality, or understanding. However, this puts me in mind of a passage\r\ntold me by a great man, though I know not whether it be anywhere\r\nrecorded. That a complaint was made to the king and council in Sweden,\r\nof a prodigious swarm of Scots, who, under the condition of pedlars,\r\ninfested that kingdom to such a degree, as, if not suddenly prevented,\r\nmight in time prove dangerous to the state, by joining with any\r\ndiscontented party. Meanwhile the Scots, by their agents, placed a good\r\nsum of money to engage the offices of the prime minister in their\r\nbehalf; who, in order to their defence, told the council, he was assured\r\nthey were but a few inconsiderable people, that lived honestly and\r\npoorly, and were not of any consequence. Their enemies offered to prove\r\nthe contrary, whereupon an order was made to take their number, which\r\nwas found to amount, as I remember, to about thirty thousand. The affair\r\nwas again brought before the council, and great reproaches made the\r\nfirst minister, for his ill computation; who, presently took the other\r\nhandle, said, he had reason to believe the number yet greater than what\r\nwas returned; and then gravely offered to the king's consideration,\r\nwhether it were safe to render desperate so great a body of able men,\r\nwho had little to lose, and whom any hard treatment would only serve to\r\nunite into a power capable of disturbing, if not destroying the peace of\r\nthe kingdom. And so they were suffered to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nFOR THE\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL USE OF IRISH MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     This pamphlet constitutes the opening of a campaign against his\r\n     political enemies in England on whom Swift had, it must be\r\n     presumed, determined to take revenge. When the fall of Harley's\r\n     administration was complete and irrevocable, Swift returned to\r\n     Ireland and, for six years, he lived the simple life of the Dean of\r\n     St. Patrick's, unheard of except by a few of his more intimate\r\n     friends in England. Accustomed by years of intimacy with the\r\n     ministers of Anne's court, and by his own temperament, to act the\r\n     part of leader and adviser, Swift's compulsory silence must have\r\n     chafed and irritated him to a degree. His opportunities for\r\n     advancement had passed with the passing of Harley and Bolingbroke\r\n     from power, and he had given too ardent and enthusiastic a support\r\n     to these friends of his for Walpole to look to him for a like\r\n     service. Moreover, however strong may have been these personal\r\n     motives, Swift's detestation of Walpole's Irish policy must have\r\n     been deep and bitter, even before he began to express himself on\r\n     the matter. His sincerity cannot be doubted, even if we make an\r\n     ample allowance for a private grudge against the great English\r\n     minister. The condition of Ireland, at this time, was such as to\r\n     arouse the warmest indignation from the most indifferent and\r\n     unprejudiced--and it was a condition for which English misrule was\r\n     mainly responsible. It cannot therefore be wondered at that Swift\r\n     should be among the strenuous and persistent opponents of a policy\r\n     which spelled ruin to his country, and his patriotism must be\r\n     recognized even if we accept the existence of a personal motive.\r\n\r\n     The crass stupidity which characterized England's dealings with\r\n     Ireland at this time would be hardly credible, were it not on\r\n     record in the acts passed in the reigns of Charles II. and William\r\n     III., and embodied in the resolutions of the English parliament\r\n     during Walpole's term of power. An impartial historian is forced to\r\n     the conclusion that England had determined to ruin the sister\r\n     nation. Already its social life was disreputable; the people taxed\r\n     in various ways far beyond their means; the agriculture at the\r\n     lowest state by the neglect and indifference of the landed\r\n     proprietors; and the manufactures crippled by a series of\r\n     pernicious restrictions imposed by a selfish rival.\r\n\r\n     Swift, in writing this \"Proposal,\" did not take advantage of any\r\n     special occasion, as he did later in the matter of Wood's\r\n     halfpence. His occasion must be found in the condition of the\r\n     country, in the injustice to which she was subjected, and in the\r\n     fact that the time had come when it would be wise and safe for him\r\n     to come out once more into the open.\r\n\r\n     He began in his characteristic way. All the evils that the laws\r\n     against the manufactures and agriculture of Ireland brought into\r\n     existence are summarized in this \"Proposal.\" His business is not to\r\n     attack the laws directly, but to attempt a method by which these\r\n     shall be nullified. Since the manufactures of Ireland might not be\r\n     exported for sale, let the people of Ireland wear them themselves,\r\n     and let them resolve and determine to wear them in preference to\r\n     those imported from England. If England had the right to prevent\r\n     the importation to it of Irish woollen goods, it was surely only\r\n     just that the Irish should exercise then right to wear their own\r\n     home-made clothes! The tract was a reasonable and mild statement.\r\n     Yet, such was the temper of the governing officials, that a cry was\r\n     raised against it and the writer accused of attempting to disunite\r\n     the two kingdoms. With consistent foolishness, the printer was\r\n     brought to trial, and although the jury acquitted him, yet the Lord\r\n     Chief Justice Whitshed, zealous for his employer more than for his\r\n     office, refused to accept the verdict and attempted to force the\r\n     jury to a conviction. In his letter to Pope, dated January 10th,\r\n     1720-21, Swift gives an account of this matter:\r\n\r\n     \"I have written in this kingdom, a discourse, to persuade the\r\n     wretched people to wear their own manufactures, instead of those\r\n     from England. This treatise soon spread very fast, being agreeable\r\n     to the sentiments of the whole nation, except those gentlemen who\r\n     had employments, or were expectants. Upon which a person in great\r\n     office here immediately took the alarm; he sent in haste for the\r\n     chief-justice, and informed him of a seditious, factious, and\r\n     virulent pamphlet, lately published, with a design of setting the\r\n     two kingdoms at variance; directing, at the same time, that the\r\n     printer should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. The\r\n     chief-justice has so quick an understanding, that he resolved, if\r\n     possible, to outdo his orders. The grand juries of the county and\r\n     city were effectually practised with, to represent the said\r\n     pamphlet with all aggravating epithets, for which they had thanks\r\n     sent them from England, and their presentments published, for\r\n     several weeks, in all the newspapers. The printer was seized, and\r\n     forced to give great bail. After his trial, the jury brought him in\r\n     not guilty, although they had been culled with the utmost industry.\r\n     The chief-justice sent them back nine times, and kept them eleven\r\n     hours, until, being perfectly tired out, they were forced to leave\r\n     the matter to the mercy of the judge, by what they call a _special\r\n     verdict_. During the trial, the chief-justice, among other\r\n     singularities, laid his hand on his breast, and protested solemnly\r\n     that the author's design was to bring in the Pretender, although\r\n     there was not a single syllable of party in the whole treatise; and\r\n     although it was known that the most eminent of those who professed\r\n     his own principles, publicly disallowed his proceedings. But the\r\n     cause being so very odious and unpopular, the trial of the verdict\r\n     was deferred from one term to another, until, upon the Duke of\r\n     Grafton's, the lord lieutenant's arrival, his grace, after mature\r\n     advice, and permission from England, was pleased to grant a _noli\r\n     prosequi_.\"\r\n\r\n     This Chief Justice Whitshed was the same who acted as judge on\r\n     Harding's trial for printing the fourth Drapier letter. Swift never\r\n     forgot him, and took several occasions to satirize him bitterly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is based on the Dublin edition of\r\n     1720 and collated with the texts of Faulkner, 1735, and\r\n     Miscellanies of same date.\r\n\r\n     [T.

Agriculture, which hath been\r\nthe principal care of all wise nations, and for the encouragement\r\nwhereof there are so many statute laws in England, we countenance so\r\nwell, that the landlords are everywhere by penal clauses absolutely\r\nprohibiting their tenants from ploughing; not satisfied to confine them\r\nwithin certain limitations, as it is the practice of the English; one\r\neffect of which is already seen in the prodigious dearness of corn, and\r\nthe importation of it from London, as the cheaper market:[6] And because\r\npeople are the riches of a country, and that our neighbours have done,\r\nand are doing all that in them lie, to make our wool a drug to us, and a\r\nmonopoly to them; therefore the politic gentlemen of Ireland have\r\ndepopulated vast tracts of the best land, for the feeding of sheep.[7]\r\n\r\nI could fill a volume as large as the history of the Wise Men of Gotham\r\nwith a catalogue only of some wonderful laws and customs we have\r\nobserved within thirty years past.[8] 'Tis true indeed, our beneficial\r\ntraffic of wool with France, hath been our only support for several\r\nyears past, furnishing us all the little money we have to pay our rents\r\nand go to market. But our merchants assure me, \"This trade hath received\r\na great damp by the present fluctuating condition of the coin in France;\r\nand that most of their wine is paid for in specie, without carrying\r\nthither any commodity from hence.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, since we are so universally bent upon enlarging our flocks, it\r\nmay be worth enquiring what we shall do with our wool, in case\r\nBarnstaple[9] should be overstocked, and our French commerce should\r\nfail?\r\n\r\nI could wish the Parliament had thought fit to have suspended their\r\nregulation of church matters, and enlargements of the prerogative till a\r\nmore convenient time, because they did not appear very pressing (at\r\nleast to the persons principally concerned) and instead of these great\r\nrefinements in politics and divinity, had amused themselves and their\r\ncommittees a little with the state of the nation. For example: What if\r\nthe House of Commons had thought fit to make a resolution _nemine\r\ncontradicente_ against wearing any cloth or stuff in their families,\r\nwhich were not of the growth and manufacture of this kingdom? What if\r\nthey had extended it so far as utterly to exclude all silks, velvets,\r\ncalicoes, and the whole lexicon of female fopperies; and declared, that\r\nwhoever acted otherwise, should be deemed and reputed an enemy to the\r\nnation?[10] What if they had sent up such a resolution to be agreed to\r\nby the House of Lords, and by their own practice and encouragement\r\nspread the execution of it in their several countries? What if we should\r\nagree to make burying in woollen a fashion, as our neighbours have made\r\nit a law? What if the ladies would be content with Irish stuffs for the\r\nfurniture of their houses, for gowns and petticoats to themselves and\r\ntheir daughters? Upon the whole, and to crown all the rest: Let a firm\r\nresolution be taken by male and female, never to appear with one single\r\nshred that comes from England; \"And let all the people say,\r\nAMEN.\"\r\n\r\nI hope and believe nothing could please His Majesty better than to hear\r\nthat his loyal subjects of both sexes in this kingdom celebrated his\r\nbirthday (now approaching) universally clad in their own manufacture. Is\r\nthere virtue enough left in this deluded people to save them from the\r\nbrink of ruin? If the men's opinions may be taken, the ladies will look\r\nas handsome in stuffs as brocades; and since all will be equal, there\r\nmay be room enough to employ their wit and fancy in choosing and\r\nmatching of patterns and colours. I heard the late Archbishop of Tuam\r\nmention a pleasant observation of somebody's; \"that Ireland would never\r\nbe happy till a law were made for burning everything that came from\r\nEngland, except their people and their coals.\" Nor am I even yet for\r\nlessening the number of those exceptions.[11]\r\n\r\n     Non tanti mitra est, non tanti judicis ostrum.\r\n\r\nBut I should rejoice to see a staylace from England be thought\r\nscandalous, and become a topic for censure at visits and tea-tables.\r\n\r\nIf the unthinking shopkeepers in this town had not been utterly\r\ndestitute of common sense, they would have made some proposal to the\r\nParliament, with a petition to the purpose I have mentioned; promising\r\nto improve the \"cloths and stuffs of the nation into all possible\r\ndegrees of fineness and colours, and engaging not to play the knave\r\naccording to their custom, by exacting and imposing upon the nobility\r\nand gentry either as to the prices or the goodness.\" For I remember in\r\nLondon upon a general mourning, the rascally mercers and\r\nwoollen-drapers, would in four-and-twenty hours raise their cloths and\r\nsilks to above a double price; and if the mourning continued long, then\r\ncome whining with petitions to the court, that they were ready to\r\nstarve, and their fineries lay upon their hands.\r\n\r\nI could wish our shopkeepers would immediately think on this proposal,\r\naddressing it to all persons of quality and others; but first be sure to\r\nget somebody who can write sense, to put it into form.\r\n\r\nI think it needless to exhort the clergy to follow this good example,\r\nbecause in a little time, those among them who are so unfortunate to\r\nhave had their birth and education in this country, will think\r\nthemselves abundantly happy when they can afford Irish crape, and an\r\nAthlone hat; and as to the others I shall not presume to direct them. I\r\nhave indeed seen the present Archbishop of Dublin clad from head to foot\r\nin our own manufacture; and yet, under the rose be it spoken, his Grace\r\ndeserves as good a gown as any prelate in Christendom.[12]\r\n\r\nI have not courage enough to offer one syllable on this subject to their\r\nhonours of the army: Neither have I sufficiently considered the great\r\nimportance of scarlet and gold lace.\r\n\r\nThe fable in Ovid of Arachne and Pallas, is to this purpose. The goddess\r\nhad heard of one Arachne a young virgin, very famous for spinning and\r\nweaving. They both met upon a trial of skill; and Pallas finding herself\r\nalmost equalled in her own art, stung with rage and envy, knocked her\r\nrival down, turned her into a spider, enjoining her to spin and weave\r\nfor ever, out of her own bowels, and in a very narrow compass. I\r\nconfess, that from a boy, I always pitied poor Arachne, and could never\r\nheartily love the goddess on account of so cruel and unjust a sentence;\r\nwhich however is fully executed upon us by England, with further\r\nadditions of rigour and severity. For the greatest part of our bowels\r\nand vitals are extracted, without allowing us the liberty of spinning\r\nand weaving them.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture tells us, that \"oppression makes a wise man mad.\"\r\nTherefore, consequently speaking, the reason why some men are not mad,\r\nis because they are not wise: However, it were to be wished that\r\noppression would in time teach a little wisdom to fools.\r\n\r\nI was much delighted with a person who hath a great estate in this\r\nkingdom, upon his complaints to me, \"how grievously poor England suffers\r\nby impositions from Ireland. That we convey our own wool to France in\r\nspite of all the harpies at the custom-house. That Mr. Shuttleworth, and\r\nothers on the Cheshire coasts are such fools to sell us their bark at a\r\ngood price for tanning our own hides into leather; with other enormities\r\nof the like weight and kind.\" To which I will venture to add some more:\r\n\"That the mayoralty of this city is always executed by an inhabitant,\r\nand often by a native, which might as well be done by a deputy, with a\r\nmoderate salary, whereby poor England lose at least one thousand pounds\r\na year upon the balance. That the governing of this kingdom costs the\r\nlord lieutenant two thousand four hundred pounds a year,[13] so much\r\n_net_ loss to poor England. That the people of Ireland presume to dig\r\nfor coals in their own grounds, and the farmers in the county of Wicklow\r\nsend their turf to the very market of Dublin, to the great\r\ndiscouragement of the coal trade at Mostyn and Whitehaven. That the\r\nrevenues of the post-office here, so righteously belonging to the\r\nEnglish treasury, as arising chiefly from our own commerce with each\r\nother, should be remitted to London, clogged with that grievous burthen\r\nof exchange, and the pensions paid out of the Irish revenues to English\r\nfavourites, should lie under the same disadvantage, to the great loss of\r\nthe grantees. When a divine is sent over to a bishopric here, with the\r\nhopes of five-and-twenty hundred pounds a year; upon his arrival, he\r\nfinds, alas! a dreadful discount of ten or twelve _per cent._ A judge or\r\na commissioner of the revenue has the same cause of complaint.\"--Lastly,\r\n\r\n\"The ballad upon Cotter is vehemently suspected to be Irish manufacture;\r\nand yet is allowed to be sung in our open streets, under the very nose\r\nof the government.\"[14] These are a few among the many hardships we put\r\nupon that _poor_ kingdom of England; for which I am confident every\r\nhonest man wishes a remedy: And I hear there is a project on foot for\r\ntransporting our best wheaten straw by sea and land carriage to\r\nDunstable; and obliging us by a law to take off yearly so many ton of\r\nstraw hats for the use of our women, which will be a great encouragement\r\nto the manufacture of that industrious town.\r\n\r\nI should be glad to learn among the divines, whether a law to bind men\r\nwithout their own consent, be obligatory _in foro conscientiae_; because\r\nI find Scripture, Sanderson and Suarez are wholly silent in the matter.\r\nThe oracle of reason, the great law of nature, and general opinion of\r\ncivilians, wherever they treat of limited governments, are indeed\r\ndecisive enough.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to observe the bias among our people in favour of\r\nthings, persons, and wares of all kinds that come from England. The\r\nprinter tells his hawkers that he has got \"an excellent new song just\r\nbrought from London.\" I have somewhat of a tendency that way myself; and\r\nupon hearing a coxcomb from thence displaying himself with great\r\nvolubility upon the park, the playhouse, the opera, the gaming\r\nordinaries, it was apt to beget in me a kind of veneration for his parts\r\nand accomplishments. 'Tis not many years, since I remember a person who\r\nby his style and literature seems to have been corrector of a\r\nhedge-press in some blind alley about Little Britain, proceed gradually\r\nto be an author, at least a translator of a lower rate, though somewhat\r\nof a larger bulk, than any that now flourishes in Grub Street; and upon\r\nthe strength of this foundation, come over here, erect himself up into\r\nan orator and politician, and lead a kingdom after him.[15] This, I am\r\ntold, was the very motive that prevailed on the author of a play, called\r\n\"Love in a hollow Tree,\" to do us the honour of a visit; presuming with\r\nvery good reason, that he was a writer of a superior class.[16] I know\r\nanother, who for thirty years past, hath been the common standard of\r\nstupidity in England, where he was never heard a minute in any assembly,\r\nor by any party with common Christian treatment; yet upon his arrival\r\nhither, could put on a face of importance and authority, talked more\r\nthan six, without either gracefulness, propriety, or meaning; and at the\r\nsame time be admired and followed as the pattern of eloquence and\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nNothing hath humbled me so much, or shewn a greater disposition to a\r\ncontemptuous treatment of Ireland in some chief governors,[17] than that\r\nhigh style of several speeches from the throne, delivered, as usual,\r\nafter the royal assent, in some periods of the two last reigns. Such\r\nhigh exaggerations of the prodigious condescensions in the prince, to\r\npass those good laws, would have but an odd sound at Westminster:\r\nNeither do I apprehend how any good law can pass, wherein the king's\r\ninterest is not as much concerned as that of the people. I remember\r\nafter a speech on the like occasion, delivered by my Lord Wharton, (I\r\nthink it was his last) he desired Mr. Addison to ask my opinion of it:\r\nMy answer was, \"That his Excellency had very honestly forfeited his head\r\non account of one paragraph; wherein he asserted by plain consequence, a\r\ndispensing power in the Queen.\" His Lordship owned it was true, but\r\nswore the words were put into his mouth by direct orders from Court.\r\nFrom whence it is clear, that some ministers in those times, were apt,\r\nfrom their high elevation, to look down upon this kingdom as if it had\r\nbeen one of their colonies of outcasts in America. And I observed a\r\nlittle of the same turn of spirit in some great men, from whom I\r\nexpected better; although to do them justice, it proved no point of\r\ndifficulty to make them correct their idea, whereof the whole nation\r\nquickly found the benefit?--But that is forgotten. How the style hath\r\nsince run, I am wholly a stranger, having never seen a speech since the\r\nlast of the Queen.\r\n\r\nI would now expostulate a little with our country landlords, who by\r\nunmeasurable screwing and racking their tenants all over the kingdom,\r\nhave already reduced the miserable people to a worse condition than the\r\npeasants in France, or the vassals in Germany and Poland; so that the\r\nwhole species of what we call substantial farmers, will in a very few\r\nyears be utterly at an end.[18] It was pleasant to observe these\r\ngentlemen labouring with all their might for preventing the bishops from\r\nletting their revenues at a moderate half value, (whereby the whole\r\norder would in an age have been reduced to manifest beggary) at the very\r\ninstant when they were everywhere canting their own lands upon short\r\nleases, and sacrificing their oldest tenants for a penny an acre\r\nadvance.[19] I know not how it comes to pass, (and yet perhaps I know\r\nwell enough) that slaves have a natural disposition to be tyrants; and\r\nthat when my betters give me a kick, I am apt to revenge it with six\r\nupon my footman; although perhaps he may be an honest and diligent\r\nfellow. I have heard great divines affirm, that \"nothing is so likely to\r\ncall down an universal judgment from Heaven upon a nation as universal\r\noppression;\" and whether this be not already verified in part, their\r\nworships the landlords are now at full leisure to consider. Whoever\r\ntravels this country, and observes the face of nature, or the faces, and\r\nhabits, and dwellings of the natives, will hardly think himself in a\r\nland where either law, religion, or common humanity is professed.[20]\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear saying one word upon a thing they call a bank, which I\r\nhear is projecting in this town.[21] I never saw the proposals, nor\r\nunderstand any one particular of their scheme: What I wish for at\r\npresent, is only a sufficient provision of hemp, and caps, and bells,\r\nto distribute according to the several degrees of honesty and prudence\r\nin some persons. I hear only of a monstrous sum already named; and if\r\nothers, do not soon hear of it too, and hear of it with a vengeance,\r\nthen am I a gentleman of less sagacity, than myself and very few\r\nbesides, take me to be. And the jest will be still the better, if it be\r\ntrue, as judicious persons have assured me, that one half of this money\r\nwill be real, and the other half only Gasconnade.[22] The matter will be\r\nlikewise much mended, if the merchants continue to carry off our gold,\r\nand our goldsmiths to melt down our heavy silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ESSAY\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nENGLISH BUBBLES.\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS HOPE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The excitement and even fury which were prevalent in England and\r\n     France during the years 1719 and 1720 over Law's South Sea schemes\r\n     afforded Swift an opportunity for the play of his satire by way of\r\n     criticism on projects which appeared to him to be of the same\r\n     character. News from France on the Mississippi Scheme which, in\r\n     1719, was at the height of its stock-jobbing success, gave glorious\r\n     accounts of fortunes made in a night, and of thousands who had\r\n     become rich and were living in unheard of luxury. Schemes were\r\n     floated on every possible kind of ventures, and so plentiful was\r\n     the \"paper money\" that nothing was too absurd for speculators. All\r\n     these schemes, which soon came to nought, went, later, by the name\r\n     of \"Bubbles,\" and this essay of Swift's touches the matter with his\r\n     usual satire.\r\n\r\n     The time chosen for the proposal for the establishment of a\r\n     National Bank in Ireland was not a happy one. It was made in 1720\r\n     when the \"Bubbles\" had burst and found thousands ruined and\r\n     pauperized. Swift, always an enemy to schemes of any kind, classed\r\n     that of the bank with the rest of the \"Bubbles,\" and, although the\r\n     plan itself was a real effort to relieve Ireland, and might have\r\n     effected its purpose, the terror of the \"Bubbles\" was sufficient to\r\n     wreck it.\r\n\r\n     It required very little from Swift to insure its rejection, and\r\n     rejected it was by the Irish legislature, before whose\r\n     consideration it was brought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Some doubt seems to obtain as to the authenticity of this \"Essay on\r\n     English Bubbles,\" which, in the words of Sir Walter Scott, may \"be\r\n     considered as introductory to the other\" tracts on the Bank\r\n     Project. This essay, however, appears in the edition of 1720 of\r\n     \"The Swearer's Bank,\" and, although it is not included in the\r\n     \"Miscellanies\" of 1722, it is accepted by Faulkner in his collected\r\n     edition of Swift's works. The present text is based on that\r\n     prefixed to the edition of \"The Swearer's Bank,\" 1720.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ESSAY ON ENGLISH BUBBLES.\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS HOPE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n     To the Right Reverend, Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful, and\r\n     to the Reverend, Honourable, and Worshipful, &c. Company of\r\n     Stockjobbers; whether Honest or Dishonest, Pious or Impious, Wise\r\n     or Otherwise, Male or Female, Young or Old, One with another, who\r\n     have suffered Depredation by the late Bubbles: _Greeting_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving received the following scheme from Dublin, I give you the\r\nearliest notice, how you may retrieve the DECUS ET TUTAMEN,[23]\r\nwhich you have sacrificed by permits in bubbles. This project is founded\r\non a Parliamentary security, besides, the devil is in it, if it can\r\nfail, since a dignitary of the Church[24] is at the head on't. Therefore\r\nyou, who have subscribed to the stocking insurance, and are out at the\r\nheels, may soon appear tight about the legs. You, who encouraged the\r\nhemp manufacture, may leave the halter to rogues, and prevent the odium\r\nof _felo de se_. Medicinal virtues are here to be had without the\r\nexpense and hazard of a dispensary: You may sleep without dreaming of\r\nbottles at your tail, and a looking-glass shall not affright you; and\r\nsince the glass bubble proved as brittle as its ware, and broke together\r\nwith itself the hopes of its proprietors, they may make themselves whole\r\nby subscribing to our new fund.\r\n\r\nHere indeed may be made three very grave objections, by incredulous\r\ninterested priests, ambitious citizens, and scrupulous statesmen. The\r\nstocking manufactory gentlemen don't know how swearing can bring 'em to\r\nany probability of covering their legs anew, unless it be by the means\r\nof a pair of stocks: That the hemp-snared men apprehend, that such an\r\nencouragement for oaths can tend to no other advancement, promotion, and\r\nexaltation of their persons, than that of the gallows: The late old\r\nordinary, Paul,[25] having grown grey in the habit of making this\r\naccurate observation in every month's Session-Paper, \"That swearing had\r\nas great a hand in the suspension of every living soul under his cure,\r\nas Sabbath-breaking itself;\" and that the glass-bubble-men cannot, for\r\ntheir lives, with the best pair of spectacles, that is the only thing\r\nleft neat and whole, out of all their wares, see how they shall make\r\nanything out of this his oath-project, supposing he should even confirm\r\nby one its goodness: An oath being, as they say, as brittle as glass,\r\nand only made to be broken.\r\n\r\nBut those incredulous priests shall not go without an answer, that will,\r\nI am sure, induce them to place a great confidence in the benefit\r\narising from Christians, who damn themselves every hour of the day. For\r\nwhile they speak of the vainness and fickleness of oaths, as an\r\nobjection against our project, they little consider that this fickleness\r\nand vainness is the common practice among all the people of this\r\nsublunary world; and that consequently, instead of being an objection\r\nagainst the project, is a concluding argument of the constancy and\r\nsolidity of their sure gain by it; a never-failing argument, as he tells\r\nus, among the brethren of his cloth.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious citizens, who from being plunged deep in the wealthy\r\nwhirlpool of the South-Sea, are in hopes of rising to such seats of\r\nfortune and dignity, as would best suit with their mounting and aspiring\r\nhopes, may imagine that this new fund, in the sister nation, may prove a\r\nrival to theirs; and, by drawing off a multitude of subscribers, will,\r\nif it makes a flood in Ireland, cause an ebb in England. But it may be\r\nanswered, that, though our author avers, that this fund will vie with\r\nthe South-Sea, yet it will not clash with it. On the contrary, the\r\nsubscribers to this must wish the increase of the South-Sea, (so far\r\nfrom being its rival); because the multitude of people raised by it, who\r\nwere plain-speakers, as they were plain-dealers before, must learn to\r\nswear, in order to become their clothes, and to be gentlemen _à la\r\nmode_; while those that are ruined, I mean Job'd by it, will dismiss the\r\npatience of their old pattern, swear at their condition, and curse their\r\nMaker in their distress; and so the increase of that English fund will\r\nbe demonstratively an ample augmentation of the Irish one: So far will\r\nit be from being rivalled by it, so that each of them may subscribe to a\r\nfund they have their own security for augmenting.\r\n\r\nThe scrupulous statesmen (for we know that statesmen are usually very\r\nscrupulous) may object against having this project secured by votes in\r\nParliament; by reason, as they may deem it, in their great wisdom, an\r\nimpious project; and that therefore so illustrious an assembly, as the\r\nIrish parliament, ought, by no means, according to the opinion of a\r\nChristian statesman, to be concerned in supporting an impious thing in\r\nthe world. The way that some may take to prove it impious, is, because\r\nit will tend highly to the interest of swearing.--But this I take to be\r\nplain downright sophistry, and playing upon words: If this be called the\r\nSwearing project, or the Oath-act, the increase of swearing will be very\r\nmuch for the benefit and interest of swearing, (_i.e._) to the\r\nsubscribers in the fund to be raised by this fruitful Swearing-act, if\r\nit should be so called; but not to the swearers themselves, who are to\r\npay for it: So that it will be, according to this distinction, piously\r\nindeed an act for a benefit to mankind, _from_ swearing, not\r\n_impiously_, a benefit _in swearing_: So that I think that argument\r\nentirely answered and defeated. Far be it from the Dean to have entered\r\ninto so unchristian a project, as this had been, so considered. But then\r\nthese politicians (being generally, as the world knows, mighty tender of\r\nconscience) may raise these new doubts, fears, and scruples, _viz._ that\r\nit will however cause the subscribers to wish, in their minds, for many\r\noaths to fly about, which is a heinous crime, and to lay stratagems to\r\ntry the patience of men of all sorts, to put them upon the swearing\r\nstrain, in order to bring grist to their own mill, which is a crime\r\nstill more enormous; and that therefore, for fear of these evil\r\nconsequences, the passing of such an act is not consistent with the\r\nreally extraordinary and tender conscience of a true modern politician.\r\nBut in answer to this, I think I can plead the strongest plea in nature,\r\nand that is called precedent, I think; which I take thus from the\r\nSouth-Sea: One man, by the very nature of that subscription, must\r\nnaturally pray for the temporal damnation of another man in his fortune,\r\nin order for gaining his own salvation in it; yea, even though he knows\r\nthe other man's temporal damnation would be the cause of his eternal, by\r\nhis swearing and despairing. Neither do I think this in casuistry and\r\nsin, because the swearing, undone man is a free agent, and can choose\r\nwhether he will swear or no, anybody's wishes whatsoever to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding: And in politics I am sure it is even a Machiavellian\r\nholy maxim, \"That some men should be ruined for the good of others.\"\r\nThus I think I have answered all the objections that can be brought\r\nagainst this project's coming to perfection, and proved it to be\r\nconvenient for the state, of interest to the Protestant church, and\r\nconsonant with Christianity, nay, with the very scruples of modern,\r\nsqueamish statesmen.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: The laudable author of this project squares the measures of\r\nit so much according to the scripture rule, it may reasonably be\r\npresumed, that all good Christians in England will come as fast into the\r\nsubscriptions for his encouragement, as they have already done\r\nthroughout the kingdom of Ireland. For what greater proof could this\r\nauthor give of his Christianity, than, for bringing about this\r\nSwearing-act, charitably to part with his coat, and sit starving in a\r\nvery thin waistcoat in his garret, to do the corporal virtues of feeding\r\nand clothing the poor, and raising them from the cottage to the palace,\r\nby punishing the vices of the rich. What more could have been done even\r\nin the primitive times!\r\n\r\n                                                 THOMAS HOPE.\r\n\r\n  From my House in St. Faith's Parish,\r\n      London, August 10, 1720.\r\n\r\nP.S.--For the benefit of the author, application may be made to me at\r\nthe Tilt-Yard Coffee-house, Whitehall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEARER'S BANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The plan for the establishment of a National Bank in Dublin was\r\n     first put forward in 1720 in the form of a petition presented to\r\n     the King by the Earl of Abercorn, Viscount Boyne, Sir Ralph Gore,\r\n     and others. It was proposed to raise a fund of £500,000 for the\r\n     purpose of loaning money to merchants at a comparatively low rate\r\n     of interest. The King approved of the petition, and directed that a\r\n     charter of incorporation for such a bank should pass the Great Seal\r\n     of Ireland. When the matter came up for discussion in the Irish\r\n     Houses of Legislature, both the Lords and Commons rejected the\r\n     proposal on the ground that no safe foundation for such an\r\n     establishment could be found. (See note _post_.)\r\n\r\n     During and after the discussion on this project in the legislature\r\n     a pamphlet controversy arose in which two able writers\r\n     distinguished themselves--Mr. Henry Maxwell and Mr. Hercules\r\n     Rowley. The former was in favour of the bank while Mr. Rowley was\r\n     against it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Maxwell argued soundly from the ground on which all banking\r\n     institutions were founded. Mr. Rowley, however, pointed out that\r\n     the condition of Ireland, dependent as that country was on\r\n     England's whims, and interfered with as she always had been, by\r\n     English selfishness, in her commercial and industrial enterprises,\r\n     would not be bettered were the bank to prove even a great success.\r\n     For, should the bank be found in any way to touch the trade of\r\n     England, it might be taken for granted that its charter would be\r\n     repealed, and Ireland find itself in a worse state than it was\r\n     before.\r\n\r\n     The pamphlets written by these gentlemen bear the following titles:\r\n\r\n         (1) Reasons offer'd for erecting a Bank in Ireland; in a letter to\r\n         Hercules Rowley, Esq., by Henry Maxwell, Esq.

But should those banks, as it is vainly\r\nimagined, be so fortunate as to obtain a charter, and purchase lands;\r\nyet on any run on them in a time of invasion, there would be so many\r\nstarving proprietors, reviving their old pretensions to land, and a\r\nbellyful, that the subscribers would be unwilling, upon any call, to\r\npart with their money, not knowing what might happen: So that in a\r\nrebellion, where the success was doubtful, the bank would infallibly\r\nbreak.[26]\r\n\r\nSince so many gentlemen of this town have had the courage, without any\r\nsecurity, to appear in the same paper with a million or two; it is\r\nhoped, when they are made sensible of their safety, that they will be\r\nprevailed to trust themselves in a neat skin of parchment with a single\r\none.\r\n\r\nTo encourage them, the undertaker proposes the erecting a bank on\r\nparliamentary security, and such security as no revolution or change of\r\ntimes can affect.\r\n\r\nTo take away all jealousy of any private view of the undertaker, he\r\nassures the world, that he is now in a garret, in a very thin waistcoat,\r\nstudying the public good, having given an undeniable pledge of his love\r\nto his country, by pawning his coat, in order to defray the expense of\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known, that by an act of parliament to prevent profane\r\nswearing, the person so offending, on oath made before a magistrate,\r\nforfeits a shilling, which may be levied with little difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary to mention, that this is become a pet-vice\r\namong us; and though age renders us unfit for other vices, yet this,\r\nwhere it takes hold, never leaves us but with our speech.\r\n\r\nSo vast a revenue might be raised by the execution of this act, that I\r\nhave often wondered, in such a scarcity of funds, that methods have not\r\nbeen taken to make it serviceable to the public.\r\n\r\nI dare venture to say, if this act was well executed in England, the\r\nrevenue of it applied to the navy, would make the English fleet a terror\r\nto all Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is computed by geographers, that there are two millions in this\r\nkingdom, (of Ireland) of which number there may be said to be a million\r\nof swearing souls.\r\n\r\nIt is thought there may be five thousand gentlemen; every gentleman,\r\ntaking one with another, may afford to swear an oath every day, which\r\nwill yearly produce one million, eight hundred, twenty-five thousand\r\noaths, which number of shillings makes the yearly sum of ninety-one\r\nthousand, two hundred and fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of this kingdom, who are computed to be ten thousand, are\r\nable to spend yearly five hundred thousand oaths, which gives\r\ntwenty-five thousand pounds; and it is conjectured, that from the bulk\r\nof the people twenty, or five-and-twenty thousand pounds may be yearly\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThese computations are very modest, since it is evident that there is a\r\nmuch greater consumption of oaths in this kingdom, and consequently a\r\nmuch greater sum might be yearly raised.\r\n\r\nThat it may be collected with ease and regularity, it is proposed to\r\nsettle informers in great towns in proportion to the number of\r\ninhabitants, and to have riding-officers in the country; and since\r\nnothing brings a greater contempt on any profession than poverty, it is\r\ndetermined to settle very handsome salaries on the gentlemen that are\r\nemployed by the bank, that they may, by a generosity of living,\r\nreconcile men to an office, that has lain under so much scandal of late,\r\nas to be undertaken by none but curates, clerks of meeting-houses, and\r\nbroken tradesmen.\r\n\r\nIt is resolved, that none shall be preferred to those employments, but\r\npersons that are notorious for being constant churchmen, and frequent\r\ncommunicants; whose piety will be a sufficient security for their honest\r\nand industrious execution of their office.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable, that twenty thousand pounds will be necessary to\r\ndefray all expenses of servants salaries, &c. However, there will be the\r\nclear yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds, which may very justly\r\nclaim a million subscription.\r\n\r\nIt is determined to lay out the remaining unapplied profits, which will\r\nbe very considerable, towards the erecting and maintaining charity\r\nschools; a design so beneficial to the public, and especially to the\r\nProtestant interest of this kingdom, has met with so much encouragement\r\nfrom several great patriots in England, that they have engaged to\r\nprocure an act to secure the sole benefit of informing, on this swearing\r\nact, to the agents and servants of this new bank. Several of my friends\r\npretend to demonstrate, that this bank will in time vie with the South\r\nSea Company: They insist, that the army dispend as many oaths yearly as\r\nwill produce one hundred thousand pounds _net_.\r\n\r\nThere are computed to be one hundred pretty fellows in this town, that\r\nswear fifty oaths a head daily; some of them would think it hard to be\r\nstinted to an hundred: This very branch would produce a vast sum yearly.\r\n\r\nThe fairs of this kingdom will bring in a vast revenue; the oaths of a\r\nlittle Connaught one, as well as they could be numbered by two persons,\r\namounted to three thousand. It is true, that it would be impossible to\r\nturn all of them into ready money; for a shilling is so great a duty on\r\nswearing, that if it was carefully exacted, the common people might as\r\nwell pretend to drink wine as to swear; and an oath would be as rare\r\namong them as a clean shirt.\r\n\r\nA servant that I employed to accompany the militia their last muster\r\nday, had scored down in the compass of eight hours, three hundred oaths,\r\nbut as the putting the act in execution on those days, would only fill\r\nthe stocks with porters, and pawn-shops with muskets and swords: And as\r\nit would be matter of great joy to Papists, and disaffected persons, to\r\nsee our militia swear themselves out of their guns and swords, it is\r\nresolved, that no advantage shall be taken of any militiaman's swearing\r\nwhile he is under arms; nor shall any advantage be taken of any man's\r\nswearing in the Four Courts provided he is at hearing in the exchequer,\r\nor has just paid off an attorney's bill.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal use of oaths is what the undertaker would by no means\r\ndiscourage, especially where it is necessary to help the lungs to throw\r\noff any distilling humour. On certificate of a course of swearing\r\nprescribed by any physician, a permit will be given to the patient by\r\nthe proper officer of the bank, paying no more but sixpence. It is\r\nexpected, that a scheme of so much advantage to the public will meet\r\nwith more encouragement than their chimerical banks; and the undertaker\r\nhopes, that as he has spent a considerable fortune in bringing this\r\nscheme to bear, he may have the satisfaction to see it take place, for\r\nthe public good, though he should have the fate of most projectors, to\r\nbe undone.\r\n\r\nIt is resolved, that no compositions shall be made, nor licences granted\r\nfor swearing, under a notion of applying the money to pious uses; a\r\npractice so scandalous as is fit only for the see of Rome, where the\r\nmoney arising from whoring licences is applied _ad propagandam fidem_:\r\nAnd to the shame of Smock-alley, and of all Protestant whores,\r\n(especially those who live under the light of the Gospel-ministry) be it\r\nspoken, a whore in Rome never lies down, but she hopes it will be the\r\nmeans of converting some poor heathen, or heretic.\r\n\r\nThe swearing revenues of the town of Cork will be given for ever, by the\r\nbank, to the support of poor clergymen's widows; and those of Ringsend\r\nwill be allowed to the maintenance of sailors' bastards.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker designs, in a few days, to appoint time and place for\r\ntaking subscriptions; the subscribers must come prepared to pay down one\r\nfourth, on subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Rotterdam have offered to farm the revenues of Dublin at\r\ntwenty thousand pounds _per ann._ Several eminent Quakers are also\r\nwilling to take them at that rent; but the undertaker has rejected their\r\nproposals, being resolved to deal with none but Christians.\r\n\r\nApplication may be made to him about them, any day at Pat's\r\ncoffee-house, where attendance will be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nKING AT ARMS.\r\n\r\n[FROM A REPUTED ESQUIRE,[27] ONE OF THE SUBSCRIBERS TO THE BANK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 18, 1721._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn a late printed paper,[28] containing some notes and queries upon that\r\nlist of the subscribers' names, which was published by order of the\r\ncommissioners for receiving of subscriptions, I find some hints and\r\ninnuendoes that would seem to insinuate, as if I and some others were\r\nonly _reputed_ esquires; and our case is referred to you, in your kingly\r\ncapacity. I desire you will please to let me know the lowest price of a\r\nreal esquire's coat of arms: And, if we can agree, I will give my bond\r\nto pay you out of the first interest I receive for my subscription;\r\nbecause things are a little low with me at present, by throwing my\r\nwhole fortune into the bank, having subscribed for five hundred pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nI hope you will not question my pretensions to this title, when I let\r\nyou know that my godfather was a justice of peace, and I myself have\r\nbeen often a keeper of it. My father was a leader and commander of\r\nhorse, in which post he rode before the greatest lords of the land;[29]\r\nand, in long marches, he alone presided over the baggage, advancing\r\ndirectly before it. My mother kept open house in Dublin, where several\r\nhundreds were supported with meat and drink, bought at her own charge,\r\nor with her personal credit, until some envious brewers and butchers\r\nforced her to retire.[30]\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I have been, for several years, a foot-officer; and it was\r\nmy charge to guard the carriages, behind which I was commanded to stick\r\nclose, that they might not be attacked in the rear. I have had the\r\nhonour to be a favourite of several fine ladies; who, each of them at\r\ndifferent times, gave me such coloured knots and public marks of\r\ndistinction, that every one knew which of them it was to whom I paid my\r\naddress. They would not go into their coach without me, nor willingly\r\ndrink unless I gave them the glass with my own hand. They allowed me to\r\ncall them my mistresses, and owned that title publicly. I have been\r\ntold, that the true ancient employment of a squire was to carry a\r\nknight's shield, painted with his colours and coat of arms. This is what\r\nI have witnesses to produce that I have often done; not indeed in a\r\nshield, like my predecessors, but that which is full as good, I have\r\ncarried the colours of a knight upon my coat.[31] I have likewise borne\r\nthe king's arms in my hand, as a mark of authority;[32] and hung them\r\npainted before my dwelling-house, as a mark of my calling:[33] So that I\r\nmay truly say, His Majesty's arms have been my supporters. I have been a\r\nstrict and constant follower of men of quality, I have diligently\r\npursued the steps of several squires, and am able to behave myself as\r\nwell as the best of them, whenever there shall be occasion.\r\n\r\nI desire it may be no disadvantage to me, that, by the new act of\r\nparliament going to pass for preserving the game, I am not yet qualified\r\nto keep a greyhound. If this should be the test of squirehood, it will\r\ngo hard with a great number of my fraternity, as well as myself, who\r\nmust all be unsquired, because a greyhound will not be allowed to keep\r\nus company; and it is well known I have been a companion to his betters.\r\nWhat has a greyhound to do with a squireship? Might I not be a real\r\nsquire, although there was no such thing as a greyhound in the world?\r\nPray tell me, sir, are greyhounds to be from henceforth the supporters\r\nof every squire's coat of arms? Although I cannot keep a greyhound, may\r\nnot a greyhound help to keep me? May not I have an order from the\r\ngovernors of the bank to keep a greyhound, with a _non obstante_ to the\r\nact of parliament, as well as they have created a bank against the votes\r\nof the two Houses? But, however, this difficulty will soon be overcome.\r\nI am promised _125l._ a year for subscribing _500l._; and, of this\r\n_500l._ I am to pay in only _25l._ ready money: The governors will trust\r\nme for the rest, and pay themselves out of the interest by _25l._ _per\r\ncent._ So that I intend to receive only _40l._ a-year, to qualify me for\r\nkeeping my family and a greyhound, and let the remaining _85l._ go on\r\ntill it makes _500l._ then _1000l._ then _10,000l._ then _100,000l._\r\nthen a million, and so forwards. This, I think, is much better (betwixt\r\nyou and me) than keeping fairs, and buying and selling bullocks; by\r\nwhich I find, from experience, that little is to be gotten, in these\r\nhard times. I am,\r\n\r\n                           SIR,\r\n                            Your friend, and\r\n                                Servant to command,\r\n                                         A. B. ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n_Postscript_. I hope you will favourably represent my case to the\r\npublisher of the paper above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nDirect your letter for A. B. Esquire, at ---- in ----; and, pray, get some\r\nparliament-man to frank it, for it will cost a groat postage to this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nLAST SPEECH AND DYING WORDS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nEBENEZER ELLISTON.\r\n\r\nWHO WAS EXECUTED THE SECOND DAY OF MAY, 1722.\r\n\r\n_Published at his desire, for the common good._\r\n\r\n\r\n     _N. B. About the time that this speech was written, the Town was\r\n     much pestered with street-robbers; who, in a barbarous manner would\r\n     seize on gentlemen, and take them into remote corners, and after\r\n     they had robbed them, would leave them bound and gagged. It is\r\n     remarkable, that this speech had so good an effect, that there have\r\n     been very few robberies of that kind committed since._[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Burke spoke of Swift's tracts of a public nature, relating to\r\n     Ireland, as \"those in which the Dean appears in the best light,\r\n     because they do honour to his heart as well as his head; furnishing\r\n     some additional proofs that, though he was very free in his abuse\r\n     of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners,\r\n     he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\n     The following tract on \"The Last Words and Dying Speech of Ebenezer\r\n     Elliston\" admirably illustrates Burke's remark.\r\n\r\n     The city of Dublin, at the time Swift wrote, was on a par with some\r\n     of the lower districts of New York City about twenty years ago,\r\n     which were dangerous in the extreme to traverse after dark. Robbers\r\n     in gangs would waylay pedestrians and leave them often badly\r\n     maltreated and maimed. These thieves and \"roughs\" became so\r\n     impudent and brazen in their business that the condition of the\r\n     city was a disgrace to the municipal government. To put down the\r\n     nuisance Swift took a characteristic method. Ebenezer Elliston had,\r\n     about this time, been executed for street robbery. Although given a\r\n     good education by his parents, he forsook his trade of a silk\r\n     weaver, and became a gambler and burglar. He was well known to the\r\n     other gangs which infested Dublin, but his death did not act as a\r\n     deterrent. Swift, in composing Elliston's pretended dying speech,\r\n     gave it the flavour and character of authenticity in order to\r\n     impose on the members of other gangs, and so successful was he in\r\n     his intention, that the speech was accepted as the real expression\r\n     of their late companion by the rest and had a most salutary effect.\r\n     Scott says it was \"received as genuine by the banditti who had been\r\n     companions of his depredations, who were the more easily persuaded\r\n     of its authenticity as it contained none of the cant usual in the\r\n     dying speeches composed for malefactors by the Ordinary or the\r\n     ballad-makers. The threat which it held out of a list deposited\r\n     with a secure hand, containing their names, crimes, and place of\r\n     rendezvous, operated for a long time in preventing a repetition of\r\n     their villanies, which had previously been so common.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is based on that given by Faulkner\r\n     in the fourth volume of his edition of Swift printed in Dublin in\r\n     1735.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SPEECH AND DYING WORDS OF EBENEZER ELLISTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am now going to suffer the just punishment for my crimes prescribed by\r\nthe law of God and my country. I know it is the constant custom, that\r\nthose who come to this place should have speeches made for them, and\r\ncried about in their own hearing, as they are carried to execution; and\r\ntruly they are such speeches that although our fraternity be an ignorant\r\nilliterate people, they would make a man ashamed to have such nonsense\r\nand false English charged upon him even when he is going to the gallows:\r\nThey contain a pretended account of our birth and family; of the fact\r\nfor which we are to die; of our sincere repentance; and a declaration of\r\nour religion.[35] I cannot expect to avoid the same treatment with my\r\npredecessors. However, having had an education one or two degrees better\r\nthan those of my rank and profession;[36] I have been considering ever\r\nsince my commitment, what it might be proper for me to deliver upon this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nAnd first, I cannot say from the bottom of my heart, that I am truly\r\nsorry for the offence I have given to God and the world; but I am very\r\nmuch so, for the bad success of my villainies in bringing me to this\r\nuntimely end. For it is plainly evident, that after having some time ago\r\nobtained a pardon from the crown, I again took up my old trade; my evil\r\nhabits were so rooted in me, and I was grown so unfit for any other\r\nkind of employment. And therefore although in compliance with my\r\nfriends, I resolve to go to the gallows after the usual manner,\r\nkneeling, with a book in my hand, and my eyes lift up; yet I shall feel\r\nno more devotion in my heart than I have observed in some of my\r\ncomrades, who have been drunk among common whores the very night before\r\ntheir execution. I can say further from my own knowledge, that two of my\r\nfraternity after they had been hanged, and wonderfully came to life, and\r\nmade their escapes, as it sometimes happens, proved afterwards the\r\nwickedest rogues I ever knew, and so continued until they were hanged\r\nagain for good and all; and yet they had the impudence at both times\r\nthey went to the gallows, to smite their breasts, and lift up their eyes\r\nto Heaven all the way.\r\n\r\nSecondly, From the knowledge I have of my own wicked dispositions and\r\nthat of my comrades, I give it as my opinion, that nothing can be more\r\nunfortunate to the public, than the mercy of the government in ever\r\npardoning or transporting us; unless when we betray one another, as we\r\nnever fail to do, if we are sure to be well paid; and then a pardon may\r\ndo good; by the same rule, \"That it is better to have but one fox in a\r\nfarm than three or four.\" But we generally make a shift to return after\r\nbeing transported, and are ten times greater rogues than before, and\r\nmuch more cunning. Besides, I know it by experience, that some hopes we\r\nhave of finding mercy, when we are tried, or after we are condemned, is\r\nalways a great encouragement to us.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Nothing is more dangerous to idle young fellows, than the\r\ncompany of those odious common whores we frequent, and of which this\r\ntown is full: These wretches put us upon all mischief to feed their\r\nlusts and extravagancies: They are ten times more bloody and cruel than\r\nmen; their advice is always not to spare if we are pursued; they get\r\ndrunk with us, and are common to us all; and yet, if they can get\r\nanything by it, are sure to be our betrayers.\r\n\r\nNow, as I am a dying man, I have done something which may be of good use\r\nto the public. I have left with an honest man (and indeed the only\r\nhonest man I was ever acquainted with) the names of all my wicked\r\nbrethren, the present places of their abode, with a short account of the\r\nchief crimes they have committed; in many of which I have been their\r\naccomplice, and heard the rest from their own mouths: I have likewise\r\nset down the names of those we call our setters, of the wicked houses we\r\nfrequent, and of those who receive and buy our stolen goods. I have\r\nsolemnly charged this honest man, and have received his promise upon\r\noath, that whenever he hears of any rogue to be tried for robbing, or\r\nhouse-breaking, he will look into his list, and if he finds the name\r\nthere of the thief concerned, to send the whole paper to the government.\r\nOf this I here give my companions fair and public warning, and hope they\r\nwill take it.\r\n\r\nIn the paper above mentioned, which I left with my friend, I have also\r\nset down the names of several gentlemen who have been robbed in Dublin\r\nstreets for three years past: I have told the circumstances of those\r\nrobberies; and shewn plainly that nothing but the want of common courage\r\nwas the cause of their misfortunes. I have therefore desired my friend,\r\nthat whenever any gentlemen happens to be robbed in the streets, he will\r\nget that relation printed and published with the first letters of those\r\ngentlemen's names, who by their own want of bravery are likely to be the\r\ncause of all the mischief of that kind, which may happen for the future.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave the world without a short description of that kind of\r\nlife, which I have led for some years past; and is exactly the same with\r\nthe rest of our wicked brethren.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are generally so corrupted from our childhood, as to have no\r\nsense of goodness; yet something heavy always hangs about us, I know not\r\nwhat it is, that we are never easy till we are half drunk among our\r\nwhores and companions; nor sleep sound, unless we drink longer than we\r\ncan stand. If we go abroad in the day, a wise man would easily find us\r\nto be rogues by our faces; we have such a suspicious, fearful, and\r\nconstrained countenance; often turning back, and slinking through narrow\r\nlanes and alleys. I have never failed of knowing a brother thief by his\r\nlooks, though I never saw him before. Every man among us keeps his\r\nparticular whore, who is however common to us all, when we have a mind\r\nto change. When we have got a booty, if it be in money, we divide it\r\nequally among our companions, and soon squander it away on our vices in\r\nthose houses that receive us; for the master and mistress, and the very\r\ntapster, go snacks; and besides make us pay treble reckonings. If our\r\nplunder be plate, watches, rings, snuff-boxes, and the like; we have\r\ncustomers in all quarters of the town to take them off. I have seen a\r\ntankard worth fifteen pounds sold to a fellow in ---- street for twenty\r\nshillings; and a gold watch for thirty. I have set down his name, and\r\nthat of several others in the paper already mentioned. We have setters\r\nwatching in corners, and by dead walls, to give us notice when a\r\ngentleman goes by; especially if he be anything in drink. I believe in\r\nmy conscience, that if an account were made of a thousand pounds in\r\nstolen goods; considering the low rates we sell them at, the bribes we\r\nmust give for concealment, the extortions of alehouse-reckonings, and\r\nother necessary charges, there would not remain fifty pounds clear to be\r\ndivided among the robbers. And out of this we must find clothes for our\r\nwhores, besides treating them from morning to night; who, in requital,\r\nreward us with nothing but treachery and the pox. For when our money is\r\ngone, they are every moment threatening to inform against us, if we will\r\nnot go out to look for more. If anything in this world be like hell, as\r\nI have heard it described by our clergy; the truest picture of it must\r\nbe in the back-room of one of our ale-houses at midnight; where a crew of\r\nrobbers and their whores are met together after a booty, and are\r\nbeginning to grow drunk, from which time, until they are past their\r\nsenses, is such a continued horrible noise of cursing, blasphemy,\r\nlewdness, scurrility, and brutish behaviour; such roaring and confusion,\r\nsuch a clatter of mugs and pots at each other's heads, that Bedlam, in\r\ncomparison, is a sober and orderly place: At last they all tumble from\r\ntheir stools and benches, and sleep away the rest of the night; and\r\ngenerally the landlord or his wife, or some other whore who has a\r\nstronger head than the rest, picks their pockets before they wake. The\r\nmisfortune is, that we can never be easy till we are drunk; and our\r\ndrunkenness constantly exposes us to be more easily betrayed and taken.\r\n\r\nThis is a short picture of the life I have led; which is more miserable\r\nthan that of the poorest labourer who works for four pence a day; and\r\nyet custom is so strong, that I am confident, if I could make my escape\r\nat the foot of the gallows, I should be following the same course this\r\nvery evening. So that upon the whole, we ought to be looked upon as the\r\ncommon enemies of mankind; whose interest it is to root us out likes\r\nwolves, and other mischievous vermin, against which no fair play is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIf I have done service to men in what I have said, I shall hope I have\r\ndone service to God; and that will be better than a silly speech made\r\nfor me full of whining and canting, which I utterly despise, and have\r\nnever been used to; yet such a one I expect to have my ears tormented\r\nwith, as I am passing along the streets.\r\n\r\nGood people fare ye well; bad as I am, I leave many worse behind me. I\r\nhope you shall see me die like a man, the death of a dog.\r\n                                                            E. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH\r\n\r\nOF SOME\r\n\r\nMAXIMS IN STATE AND GOVERNMENT,\r\n\r\nEXAMINED\r\n\r\nWITH REFERENCE TO IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     These maxims, written in the year 1724, may be taken as Swift's\r\n     opening of his campaign against the oppressive legislation of\r\n     England which had brought Ireland to the degraded and\r\n     poverty-stricken condition it existed in at the time he wrote.\r\n     Burke characterizes these maxims as \"a collection of State\r\n     Paradoxes, abounding with great sense and penetration.\" The\r\n     subjects they touch on are dealt with in greater detail in the\r\n     tracts which follow in this volume, and the reader is referred to\r\n     them and the notes for the causes which had brought Ireland in so\r\n     low a state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is based on that given by Deane\r\n     Swift in the eighth volume of the edition of 1765.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS CONTROLLED[37] IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain maxims of state, founded upon long observation and\r\nexperience, drawn from the constant practice of the wisest nations, and\r\nfrom the very principles of government, nor ever controlled by any\r\nwriter upon politics. Yet all these maxims do necessarily presuppose a\r\nkingdom, or commonwealth, to have the same natural rights common to the\r\nrest of mankind, who have entered into civil society; for if we could\r\nconceive a nation where each of the inhabitants had but one eye, one\r\nleg, and one hand, it is plain that, before you could institute them\r\ninto a republic, an allowance must be made for those material defects\r\nwherein they differed from other mortals. Or, imagine a legislator\r\nforming a system for the government of Bedlam, and, proceeding upon the\r\nmaxim that man is a sociable animal, should draw them out of their\r\ncells, and form them into corporations or general assemblies; the\r\nconsequence might probably be, that they would fall foul on each other,\r\nor burn the house over their own heads.\r\n\r\nOf the like nature are innumerable errors committed by crude and short\r\nthinkers, who reason upon general topics, without the least allowance\r\nfor the most important circumstances, which quite alter the nature of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThis hath been the fate of those small dealers, who are every day\r\npublishing their thoughts, either on paper or in their assemblies, for\r\nimproving the trade of Ireland, and referring us to the practice and\r\nexample of England, Holland, France, or other nations.\r\n\r\nI shall, therefore, examine certain maxims of government, which\r\ngenerally pass for uncontrolled in the world, and consider how far they\r\nwill suit with the present condition of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nFirst, It is affirmed by wise men, that \"The dearness of things\r\nnecessary for life, in a fruitful country, is a certain sign of wealth\r\nand great commerce;\" for when such necessaries are dear, it must\r\nabsolutely follow that money is cheap and plentiful.\r\n\r\nBut this is manifestly false in Ireland, for the following reason. Some\r\nyears ago, the species of money here did probably amount to six or seven\r\nhundred thousand pounds;[38] and I have good cause to believe, that our\r\nremittances then did not much exceed the cash brought in to us. But, the\r\nprodigious discouragements we have since received in every branch of our\r\ntrade, by the frequent enforcements and rigorous execution of the\r\nnavigation-act,[39] the tyranny of under custom-house officers, the\r\nyearly addition of absentees, the payments to regiments abroad, to civil\r\nand military officers residing in England, the unexpected sudden demands\r\nof great sums from the treasury, and some other drains of perhaps as\r\ngreat consequence,[40] we now see ourselves reduced to a state (since we\r\nhave no friends) of being pitied by our enemies; at least, if our\r\nenemies were of such a kind, as to be capable of any regard towards us\r\nexcept of hatred and contempt.\r\n\r\nForty years are now passed since the Revolution, when the contention of\r\nthe British Empire was, most unfortunately for us, and altogether\r\nagainst the usual course of such mighty changes in government, decided\r\nin the least important nation; but with such ravages and ruin executed\r\non both sides, as to leave the kingdom a desert, which in some sort it\r\nstill continues. Neither did the long rebellions in 1641, make half such\r\na destruction of houses, plantations, and personal wealth, in both\r\nkingdoms, as two years campaigns did in ours, by fighting England's\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees, and by the gentle treatment we received under two\r\nauspicious reigns,[41] we grew able to live without running in debt. Our\r\nabsentees were but few: we had great indulgence in trade, a considerable\r\nshare in employments of church and state; and while the short leases\r\ncontinued, which were let some years after the war ended, tenants paid\r\ntheir rents with ease and cheerfulness, to the great regret of their\r\nlandlords, who had taken up a spirit of oppression that is not easily\r\nremoved. And although, in these short leases, the rent was gradually to\r\nincrease after short periods, yet, as soon as the terms elapsed, the\r\nland was let to the highest bidder, most commonly without the least\r\neffectual clause for building or planting. Yet, by many advantages,\r\nwhich this island then possessed, and hath since utterly lost, the rents\r\nof lands still grew higher upon every lease that expired, till they have\r\narrived at the present exorbitance; when the frog, over-swelling\r\nhimself, burst at last.\r\n\r\nWith the price of land of necessity rose that of corn and cattle, and\r\nall other commodities that farmers deal in: hence likewise, obviously,\r\nthe rates of all goods and manufactures among shopkeepers, the wages of\r\nservants, and hire of labourers. But although our miseries came on fast,\r\nwith neither trade nor money left; yet neither will the landlord abate\r\nin his rent, nor can the tenant abate in the price of what that rent\r\nmust be paid with, nor any shopkeeper, tradesman, or labourer live, at\r\nlower expense for food and clothing, than he did before.\r\n\r\nI have been the larger upon this first head, because the same\r\nobservations will clear up and strengthen a good deal of what I shall\r\naffirm upon the rest.\r\n\r\nThe second maxim of those who reason upon trade and government, is, to\r\nassert that \"Low interest is a certain sign of great plenty of money in\r\na nation,\" for which, as in many other articles, they produce the\r\nexamples of Holland and England. But, with relation to Ireland, this\r\nmaxim is likewise entirely false.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for the lowness of interest in any country. First,\r\nthat which is usually alleged, the great plenty of species; and this is\r\nobvious. The second is, the want of trade, which seldom falls under\r\ncommon observation, although it be equally true: for, where trade is\r\naltogether discouraged, there are few borrowers. In those countries\r\nwhere men can employ a large stock, the young merchant, whose fortune\r\nmay be four or five hundred pounds, will venture to borrow as much more,\r\nand can afford a reasonable interest. Neither is it easy, at this day,\r\nto find many of those, whose business reaches to employ even so\r\ninconsiderable a sum, except among the importers of wine, who, as they\r\nhave most part of the present trade in these parts of Ireland in their\r\nhands, so they are the most exorbitant, exacting, fraudulent dealers,\r\nthat ever trafficked in any nation, and are making all possible speed to\r\nruin both themselves and the nation.\r\n\r\nFrom this defect of gentlemen's not knowing how to dispose of their\r\nready money, ariseth the high purchase of lands, which in all other\r\ncountries is reckoned a sign of wealth. For, the frugal squires, who\r\nlive below their incomes, have no other way to dispose of their savings\r\nbut by mortgage or purchase, by which the rates of land must naturally\r\nincrease; and if this trade continues long, under the uncertainty of\r\nrents, the landed men of ready money will find it more for their\r\nadvantage to send their cash to England, and place it in the funds;\r\nwhich I myself am determined to do, the first considerable sum I shall\r\nbe master of.\r\n\r\nIt hath likewise been a maxim among politicians, \"That the great\r\nincrease of buildings in the metropolis, argues a flourishing state.\"\r\nBut this, I confess, hath been controlled from the example of London;\r\nwhere, by the long and annual parliamentary session, such a number of\r\nsenators, with their families, friends, adherents, and expectants, draw\r\nsuch prodigious numbers to that city, that the old hospitable custom of\r\nlords and gentlemen living in their ancient seats among their tenants,\r\nis almost lost in England; is laughed out of doors; insomuch that, in\r\nthe middle of summer, a legal House of Lords and Commons might be\r\nbrought in a few hours to London, from their country villas within\r\ntwelve miles round.\r\n\r\nThe case in Ireland is yet somewhat worse: For the absentees of great\r\nestates, who, if they lived at home, would have many rich retainers in\r\ntheir neighbourhoods, have learned to rack their lands, and shorten\r\ntheir leases, as much as any residing squire; and the few remaining of\r\nthese latter, having some vain hope of employments for themselves, or\r\ntheir children, and discouraged by the beggarliness and thievery of\r\ntheir own miserable farmers and cottagers, or seduced by the vanity of\r\ntheir wives, on pretence of their children's education (whereof the\r\nfruits are so apparent,) together with that most wonderful, and yet more\r\nunaccountable zeal, for a seat in their assembly, though at some years'\r\npurchase of their whole estates: these, and some other motives better\r\nlet pass, have drawn such a concourse to this beggarly city, that the\r\ndealers of the several branches of building have found out all the\r\ncommodious and inviting places for erecting new houses; while fifteen\r\nhundred of the old ones, which is a seventh part of the whole city, are\r\nsaid to be left uninhabited, and falling to ruin. Their method is the\r\nsame with that which was first introduced by Dr. Barebone at London, who\r\ndied a bankrupt.[42] The mason, the bricklayer, the carpenter, the\r\nslater, and the glazier, take a lot of ground, club to build one or more\r\nhouses, unite their credit, their stock, and their money; and when their\r\nwork is finished, sell it to the best advantage they can. But, as it\r\noften happens, and more every day, that their fund will not answer half\r\ntheir design, they are forced to undersell it at the first story, and\r\nare all reduced to beggary. Insomuch, that I know a certain fanatic\r\nbrewer, who is reported to have some hundreds of houses in this town, is\r\nsaid to have purchased the greater part of them at half value from\r\nruined undertakers; hath intelligence of all new houses where the\r\nfinishing is at a stand, takes advantage of the builder's distress, and,\r\nby the advantage of ready money, gets fifty _per cent._ at least for his\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nIt is another undisputed maxim in government, \"That people are the\r\nriches of a nation;\" which is so universally granted, that it will be\r\nhardly pardonable to bring it in doubt. And I will grant it to be so far\r\ntrue, even in this island, that if we had the African custom, or\r\nprivilege, of selling our useless bodies for slaves to foreigners, it\r\nwould be the most useful branch of our trade, by ridding us of a most\r\nunsupportable burthen, and bringing us money in the stead. But, in our\r\npresent situation, at least five children in six who are born, lie a\r\ndead weight upon us, for want of employment. And a very skilful computer\r\nassured me, that above one half of the souls in this kingdom supported\r\nthemselves by begging and thievery; whereof two thirds would be able to\r\nget their bread in any other country upon earth.[43] Trade is the only\r\nincitement to labour; where that fails, the poorer native must either\r\nbeg, steal, or starve, or be forced to quit his country. This hath made\r\nme often wish, for some years past, that instead of discouraging our\r\npeople from seeking foreign soil, the public would rather pay for\r\ntransporting all our unnecessary mortals, whether Papists or\r\nProtestants, to America; as drawbacks are sometimes allowed for\r\nexporting commodities, where a nation is overstocked. I confess myself\r\nto be touched with a very sensible pleasure, when I hear of a mortality\r\nin any country parish or village, where the wretches are forced to pay\r\nfor a filthy cabin, and two ridges of potatoes, treble the worth;\r\nbrought up to steal or beg, for want of work; to whom death would be the\r\nbest thing to be wished for on account both of themselves and the\r\npublic.[44]\r\n\r\nAmong all taxes imposed by the legislature, those upon luxury are\r\nuniversally allowed to be the most equitable, and beneficial to the\r\nsubject; and the commonest reasoner on government might fill a volume\r\nwith arguments on the subject. Yet here again, by the singular fate of\r\nIreland, this maxim is utterly false; and the putting it in practice may\r\nhave such pernicious a consequence, as, I certainly believe, the\r\nthoughts of the proposers were not able to reach.\r\n\r\nThe miseries we suffer by our absentees, are of a far more extensive\r\nnature than seems to be commonly understood. I must vindicate myself to\r\nthe reader so far, as to declare solemnly, that what I shall say of\r\nthose lords and squires, doth not arise from the least regard I have for\r\ntheir understandings, their virtues, or their persons: for, although I\r\nhave not the honour of the least acquaintance with any one among them,\r\n(my ambition not soaring so high) yet I am too good a witness of the\r\nsituation they have been in for thirty years past; the veneration paid\r\nthem by the people, the high esteem they are in among the prime nobility\r\nand gentry, the particular marks of favour and distinction they receive\r\nfrom the Court; the weight and consequence of their interest, added to\r\ntheir great zeal and application for preventing any hardships their\r\ncountry might suffer from England, wisely considering that their own\r\nfortunes and honours were embarked in the same bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nBLUNDERS, DEFICIENCIES, DISTRESSES,\r\n\r\nAND MISFORTUNES OF QUILCA.\r\n\r\nPROPOSED TO CONTAIN ONE AND TWENTY VOLUMES IN QUARTO\r\n\r\n_Begun April 20, 1724.

He had no high opinion of\r\n     the people with whom he was compelled to live. But among those who\r\n     displeased him least, to use the phrase he employed in writing to\r\n     Pope, was a kindly and warm-hearted scholar named Sheridan.\r\n     Sheridan must have taken Swift's fancy, since they spent much time\r\n     together and wrote each other verses and nonsense rhymes. He had\r\n     failed in his attempt to keep up a school in Dublin, and refused\r\n     the headmastership of the school of Armagh which Lord Primate\r\n     Lindsay had offered him, through Swift's efforts. Swift however\r\n     obtained for him, from Carteret, one of the chaplaincies of the\r\n     Lord-Lieutenant and a small living near Cork. Unfortunately\r\n     Sheridan was struck off from the list of chaplains on the\r\n     information of one Richard Tighe who reported that Sheridan, on the\r\n     anniversary of the accession of the House of Hanover, had preached\r\n     from the text \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" Poor\r\n     Sheridan had been totally unconscious of committing any\r\n     indiscretion, but he could not deny the fact.\r\n\r\n     It was at Quilca, a small county village, near Kells, that Sheridan\r\n     was accustomed to spend his vacations with his family at a small\r\n     house he owned there. Swift used often to use this house, at\r\n     Sheridan's desire, and spent many days there in quiet enjoyment\r\n     with Mrs. Dingley and Esther Johnson. The place and his life there\r\n     he has attempted to describe in the following piece; but the\r\n     description may also stand, as Scott observes, as \"no bad\r\n     supplement to Swift's account of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text here given is based on that printed in the eighth volume\r\n     of the Edinburgh edition of 1761.\r\n\r\n     [T.

Swift, however, does\r\n     not lose sight of the fact that the people of Ireland also were\r\n     somewhat to blame, though in a much less degree.\r\n\r\n     In Dublin, where tracts of this nature had now become almost\r\n     commonplace and where official interference in their publication\r\n     had been found unwise and even dangerous, the issue of the \"Short\r\n     View\" was effected without any official comment. In England,\r\n     however, where it was reprinted by Mist the journalist, it was\r\n     otherwise. Its publication brought down a prosecution on Mist, who,\r\n     no doubt, numbered this with the many others which were visited\r\n     upon him. It is an important tract, to which many historians of\r\n     Ireland have often referred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is based on that of the first\r\n     edition and compared with that given by Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT VIEW\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am assured that it hath for some time been practised as a method of\r\nmaking men's court, when they are asked about the rate of lands, the\r\nabilities of tenants, the state of trade and manufacture in this\r\nKingdom, and how their rents are paid, to answer, That in their\r\nneighbourhood all things are in a flourishing condition, the rent and\r\npurchase of land every day increasing. And if a gentleman happens to be\r\na little more sincere in his representations, besides being looked on as\r\nnot well affected, he is sure to have a dozen contradictors at his\r\nelbow. I think it is no manner of secret why these questions are so\r\ncordially asked, or so obligingly answered.\r\n\r\nBut since with regard to the affairs of this Kingdom, I have been using\r\nall endeavours to subdue my indignation, to which indeed I am not\r\nprovoked by any personal interest, being not the owner of one spot of\r\nground in the whole Island, I shall only enumerate by rules generally\r\nknown, and never contradicted, what are the true causes of any country's\r\nflourishing and growing rich, and then examine what effects arise from\r\nthose causes in the Kingdom of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe first cause of a Kingdom's thriving is the fruitfulness of the soil,\r\nto produce the necessaries and conveniences of life, not only sufficient\r\nfor the inhabitants, but for exportation into other countries.\r\n\r\nThe second, is the industry of the people in working up all their native\r\ncommodities to the last degree of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe third, is the conveniency of safe ports and havens, to carry out\r\ntheir own goods, as much manufactured, and bring in those of others, as\r\nlittle manufactured as the nature of mutual commerce will allow.\r\n\r\nThe fourth, is, That the natives should as much as possible, export and\r\nimport their goods in vessels of their own timber, made in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, is the liberty of a free trade in all foreign countries,\r\nwhich will permit them, except those who are in war with their own\r\nPrince or State.\r\n\r\nThe sixth, is, by being governed only by laws made with their own\r\nconsent, for otherwise they are not a free People. And therefore all\r\nappeals for justice, or applications, for favour or preferment to\r\nanother country, are so many grievous impoverishments.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, is, by improvement of land, encouragement of agriculture,\r\nand thereby increasing the number of their people, without which any\r\ncountry, however blessed by Nature, must continue poor.\r\n\r\nThe eighth, is the residence of the Princes, or chief administrators of\r\nthe civil power.\r\n\r\nThe ninth, is the concourse of foreigners for education, curiosity or\r\npleasure, or as to a general mart of trade.\r\n\r\nThe tenth, is by disposing all offices of honour, profit or trust, only\r\nto the natives, or at least with very few exceptions, where strangers\r\nhave long inhabited the country, and are supposed to understand, and\r\nregard the interest of it as their own.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh is, when the rents of lands, and profits of employments,\r\nare spent in the country which produced them, and not in another, the\r\nformer of which will certainly happen, where the love of our native\r\ncountry prevails.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth, is by the public revenues being all spent and employed at\r\nhome, except on the occasions of a foreign war.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth, is where the people are not obliged, unless they find it\r\nfor their own interest, or conveniency, to receive any monies, except of\r\ntheir own coinage by a public mint, after the manner of all civilized\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth, is a disposition of the people of a country to wear\r\ntheir own manufactures, and import as few incitements to luxury, either\r\nin clothes, furniture, food or drink, as they possibly can live\r\nconveniently without.\r\n\r\nThere are many other causes of a Nation's thriving, which I cannot at\r\npresent recollect; but without advantage from at least some of these,\r\nafter turning my thoughts a long time, I am not able to discover from\r\nwhence our wealth proceeds, and therefore would gladly be better\r\ninformed. In the mean time, I will here examine what share falls to\r\nIreland of these causes, or of the effects and consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to complain, but barely to relate facts, and the\r\nmatter is not of small importance. For it is allowed, that a man who\r\nlives in a solitary house far from help, is not wise in endeavouring to\r\nacquire in the neighbourhood, the reputation of being rich, because\r\nthose who come for gold, will go off with pewter and brass, rather than\r\nreturn empty; and in the common practice of the world, those who possess\r\nmost wealth, make the least parade, which they leave to others, who have\r\nnothing else to bear them out, in shewing their faces on the Exchange.\r\n\r\nAs to the first cause of a Nation's riches, being the fertility of the\r\nsoil, as well as temperature of climate, we have no reason to complain;\r\nfor although the quantity of unprofitable land in this Kingdom,\r\nreckoning bog, and rock, and barren mountain, be double in proportion to\r\nwhat it is in England, yet the native productions which both Kingdoms\r\ndeal in, are very near on equality in point of goodness, and might with\r\nthe same encouragement be as well manufactured. I except mines and\r\nminerals, in some of which however we are only defective in point of\r\nskill and industry.\r\n\r\nIn the second, which is the industry of the people, our misfortune is\r\nnot altogether owing to our own fault, but to a million of\r\ndiscouragements.\r\n\r\nThe conveniency of ports and havens which Nature bestowed us so\r\nliberally is of no more use to us, than a beautiful prospect to a man\r\nshut up in a dungeon.\r\n\r\nAs to shipping of its own, this Kingdom is so utterly unprovided, that\r\nof all the excellent timber cut down within these fifty or sixty years,\r\nit can hardly be said that the Nation hath received the benefit of one\r\nvaluable house to dwell in, or one ship to trade with.\r\n\r\nIreland is the only Kingdom I ever heard or read of, either in ancient\r\nor modern story, which was denied the liberty of exporting their native\r\ncommodities and manufactures wherever they pleased, except to countries\r\nat war with their own Prince or State, yet this by the superiority of\r\nmere power is refused us in the most momentous parts of commerce,[49]\r\nbesides an Act of Navigation to which we never consented, pinned down\r\nupon us, and rigorously executed,[50] and a thousand other unexampled\r\ncircumstances as grievous as they are invidious to mention. To go unto\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIt is too well known that we are forced to obey some laws we never\r\nconsented to, which is a condition I must not call by its true\r\nuncontroverted name for fear of my Lord Chief Justice Whitshed's ghost\r\nwith his _Libertas et natale solum_, written as a motto on his coach, as\r\nit stood at the door of the court, while he was perjuring himself to\r\nbetray both.[51] Thus, we are in the condition of patients who have\r\nphysic sent them by doctors at a distance, strangers to their\r\nconstitution, and the nature of their disease: And thus, we are forced\r\nto pay five hundred _per cent._ to divide our properties, in all which\r\nwe have likewise the honour to be distinguished from the whole race of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nAs to improvement of land, those few who attempt that or planting,\r\nthrough covetousness or want of skill, generally leave things worse than\r\nthey were, neither succeeding in trees nor hedges, and by running into\r\nthe fancy of grazing after the manner of the Scythians, are every day\r\ndepopulating the country.\r\n\r\nWe are so far from having a King to reside among us, that even the\r\nViceroy is generally absent four-fifths of his time in the Government.\r\n\r\nNo strangers from other countries make this a part of their travels,\r\nwhere they can expect to see nothing but scenes of misery and\r\ndesolation.[52]\r\n\r\nThose who have the misfortune to be born here, have the least title to\r\nany considerable employment to which they are seldom preferred, but upon\r\na political consideration.\r\n\r\nOne third part of the rents of Ireland is spent in England, which with\r\nthe profit of employments, pensions, appeals, journeys of pleasure or\r\nhealth, education at the Inns of Court, and both Universities,\r\nremittances at pleasure, the pay of all superior officers in the army\r\nand other incidents, will amount to a full half of the income of the\r\nwhole Kingdom, all clear profit to England.\r\n\r\nWe are denied the liberty of coining gold, silver, or even copper. In\r\nthe Isle of Man, they coin their own silver, every petty Prince, vassal\r\nto the Emperor, can coin what money he pleaseth.[53] And in this as in\r\nmost of the articles already mentioned, we are an exception to all other\r\nStates or Monarchies that were ever known in the world.\r\n\r\nAs to the last, or fourteenth article, we take special care to act\r\ndiametrically contrary to it in the whole course of our lives. Both\r\nsexes, but especially the women, despise and abhor to wear any of their\r\nown manufactures, even those which are better made than in other\r\ncountries, particularly a sort of silk plaid, through which the workmen\r\nare forced to run a sort of gold thread that it may pass for Indian.\r\nEven ale and potatoes in great quantity are imported from England as\r\nwell as corn, and our foreign trade is little more than importation of\r\nFrench wine, for which I am told we pay ready money.\r\n\r\nNow if all this be true, upon which I could easily enlarge, I would be\r\nglad to know by what secret method it is that we grow a rich and\r\nflourishing people, without liberty, trade, manufactures, inhabitants,\r\nmoney, or the privilege of coining; without industry, labour or\r\nimprovement of lands, and with more than half of the rent and profits of\r\nthe whole Kingdom, annually exported, for which we receive not a single\r\nfarthing: And to make up all this, nothing worth mentioning, except the\r\nlinen of the North, a trade casual, corrupted, and at mercy, and some\r\nbutter from Cork. If we do flourish, it must be against every law of\r\nNature and Reason, like the thorn at Glastonbury, that blossoms in the\r\nmidst of Winter.\r\n\r\nLet the worthy Commissioners who come from England ride round the\r\nKingdom, and observe the face of Nature, or the face of the natives, the\r\nimprovement of the land, the thriving numerous plantations, the noble\r\nwoods, the abundance and vicinity of country seats, the commodious\r\nfarmers houses and barns, the towns and villages, where everybody is\r\nbusy and thriving with all kind of manufactures, the shops full of goods\r\nwrought to perfection, and filled with customers, the comfortable diet\r\nand dress, and dwellings of the people, the vast numbers of ships in our\r\nharbours and docks, and shipwrights in our sea-port towns. The roads\r\ncrowded with carriers laden with rich manufactures, the perpetual\r\nconcourse to and fro of pompous equipages.\r\n\r\nWith what envy and admiration would these gentlemen return from so\r\ndelightful a progress? What glorious reports would they make when they\r\nwent back to England?\r\n\r\nBut my heart is too heavy to continue this journey[54] longer, for it is\r\nmanifest that whatever stranger took such a journey, would be apt to\r\nthink himself travelling in Lapland or Ysland,[55] rather than in a\r\ncountry so favoured by Nature as ours, both in fruitfulness of soil, and\r\ntemperature of climate. The miserable dress, and diet, and dwelling of\r\nthe people. The general desolation in most parts of the Kingdom. The old\r\nseats of the nobility and gentry all in ruins, and no new ones in their\r\nstead. The families of farmers who pay great rents, living in filth and\r\nnastiness upon butter-milk and potatoes, without a shoe or stocking to\r\ntheir feet, or a house so convenient as an English hog-sty to receive\r\nthem.[56] These indeed may be comfortable sights to an English\r\nspectator, who comes for a short time only to learn the language, and\r\nreturns back to his own country, whither he finds all our wealth\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\n  _Nostrâ miseriâ magnus es._\r\n\r\nThere is not one argument used to prove the riches of Ireland, which is\r\nnot a logical demonstration of its poverty. The rise of our rents is\r\nsqueezed out of the very blood and vitals, and clothes, and dwellings of\r\nthe tenants who live worse than English beggars. The lowness of\r\ninterest, in all other countries a sign of wealth, is in us a proof of\r\nmisery, there being no trade to employ any borrower. Hence alone comes\r\nthe dearness of land, since the savers have no other way to lay out\r\ntheir money. Hence the dearness of necessaries for life, because the\r\ntenants cannot afford to pay such extravagant rates for land (which they\r\nmust take, or go a-begging) without raising the price of cattle, and of\r\ncorn, although they should live upon chaff. Hence our increase of\r\nbuildings in this City, because workmen have nothing to do but employ\r\none another, and one half of them are infallibly undone. Hence the daily\r\nincrease of bankers, who may be a necessary evil in a trading country,\r\nbut so ruinous in ours, who for their private advantage have sent away\r\nall our silver, and one third of our gold, so that within three years\r\npast the running cash of the Nation, which was about five hundred\r\nthousand pounds, is now less than two, and must daily diminish unless we\r\nhave liberty to coin, as well as that important Kingdom the Isle of Man,\r\nand the meanest Prince in the German Empire, as I before observed.[57]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought, that this paradox of the Kingdom growing rich,\r\nis chiefly owing to those worthy gentlemen the BANKERS, who, except some\r\ncustom-house officers, birds of passage, oppressive thrifty squires, and\r\na few others that shall be nameless, are the only thriving people among\r\nus: And I have often wished that a law were enacted to hang up half a\r\ndozen bankers every year, and thereby interpose at least some short\r\ndelay, to the further ruin of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"Ye are idle, ye are idle,\" answered Pharaoh to the Israelites, when\r\nthey complained to his Majesty, that they were forced to make bricks\r\nwithout straw.\r\n\r\nEngland enjoys every one of these advantages for enriching a Nation,\r\nwhich I have above enumerated, and into the bargain, a good million\r\nreturned to them every year without labour or hazard, or one farthing\r\nvalue received on our side. But how long we shall be able to continue\r\nthe payment, I am not under the least concern. One thing I know, that\r\n_when the hen is starved to death, there will be no more golden eggs_.\r\n\r\nI think it a little unhospitable, and others may call it a subtile piece\r\nof malice, that, because there may be a dozen families in this Town,\r\nable to entertain their English friends in a generous manner at their\r\ntables, their guests upon their return to England, shall report that we\r\nwallow in riches and luxury.\r\n\r\nYet I confess I have known an hospital, where all the household officers\r\ngrew rich, while the poor for whose sake it was built, were almost\r\nstarving for want of food and raiment.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. If Ireland be a rich and flourishing Kingdom, its wealth\r\nand prosperity must be owing to certain causes, that are yet concealed\r\nfrom the whole race of mankind, and the effects are equally invisible.\r\nWe need not wonder at strangers when they deliver such paradoxes, but a\r\nnative and inhabitant of this Kingdom, who gives the same verdict, must\r\nbe either ignorant to stupidity, or a man-pleaser at the expense of all\r\nhonour, conscience and truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nINJURED LADY.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY HERSELF.\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER TO THE\r\n\r\nINJURED LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Under the guises of a gentleman and two ladies, Swift represents\r\n     England, Scotland, and Ireland--England being the gentleman and\r\n     Scotland and Ireland the two mistresses for whom he is affecting an\r\n     honourable love. The Injured Lady is Ireland, who represents her\r\n     rival, Scotland, as unworthy of her lover's attention. She\r\n     expatiates on her own attractions and upbraids him also on his\r\n     treatment of her. This affords Swift an opportunity for some\r\n     searching and telling criticism on England's conduct towards\r\n     Ireland. The fiction is admirably maintained throughout the story.\r\n\r\n     In \"The Answer to the Injured Lady\" which follows \"The Story,\"\r\n     Swift takes it upon himself to give her proper advice for her\r\n     future conduct towards her lover. In this advice he reiterates what\r\n     he has always been saying to the people of Ireland, but formulates\r\n     it in the language affected by the lady herself. He tells her that\r\n     she should look to it that her \"family and tenants have no\r\n     dependence upon the said gentleman farther than by the old\r\n     agreement [the Act of Henry VII], which obliges you to have the\r\n     same steward, and to regulate your household by such methods as you\r\n     should both agree to\"; that she shall be free to carry her goods to\r\n     any market she pleases; that she shall compel the servants to whom\r\n     she pays wages to remain at home; and that if she make an agreement\r\n     with a tenant, it shall not be in his power to break it. If she\r\n     will only show a proper spirit, he assures her that there are\r\n     gentlemen who would be glad of an occasion to support her in her\r\n     resentment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of both the tracts here given is based on that of the\r\n     earliest edition I could find, namely, that of 1746, collated with\r\n     that given by Faulkner.\r\n\r\n     [T.

MDCCXLVI.\r\n\r\n[Price One Shilling.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nBeing ruined by the inconstancy and unkindness of a lover, I hope, a\r\ntrue and plain relation of my misfortunes may be of use and warning to\r\ncredulous maids, never to put too much trust in deceitful men.\r\n\r\nA gentleman[58] in the neighbourhood had two mistresses, another and\r\nmyself;[59] and he pretended honourable love to us both. Our three\r\nhouses stood pretty near one another; his was parted from mine by a\r\nriver,[60] and from my rival's by an old broken wall.[61] But before I\r\nenter into the particulars of this gentleman's hard usage of me, I will\r\ngive a very just impartial character of my rival and myself.\r\n\r\nAs to her person she is tall and lean, and very ill shaped; she hath bad\r\nfeatures, and a worse complexion; she hath a stinking breath, and twenty\r\nill smells about her besides; which are yet more insufferable by her\r\nnatural sluttishness; for she is always lousy, and never without the\r\nitch. As to other qualities, she hath no reputation either for virtue,\r\nhonesty, truth, or manners; and it is no wonder, considering what her\r\neducation hath been. Scolding and cursing are her common conversation.\r\nTo sum up all; she is poor and beggarly, and gets a sorry maintenance by\r\npilfering wherever she comes. As for this gentleman who is now so fond\r\nof her, she still beareth him an invincible hatred; revileth him to his\r\nface, and raileth at him in all companies. Her house is frequented by a\r\ncompany of rogues and thieves, and pickpockets, whom she encourageth to\r\nrob his hen-roosts, steal his corn and cattle, and do him all manner of\r\nmischief.[62] She hath been known to come at the head of these rascals,\r\nand beat her lover until he was sore from head to foot, and then force\r\nhim to pay for the trouble she was at. Once, attended with a crew of\r\nragamuffins, she broke into his house, turned all things topsy-turvy,\r\nand then set it on fire. At the same time she told so many lies among\r\nhis servants, that it set them all by the ears, and his poor _Steward_\r\nwas knocked on the head;[63] for which I think, and so doth all the\r\nCountry, that she ought to be answerable. To conclude her character; she\r\nis of a different religion, being a Presbyterian of the most rank and\r\nvirulent kind, and consequently having an inveterate hatred to the\r\nChurch; yet, I am sure, I have been always told, that in marriage there\r\nought to be an union of minds as well as of persons.\r\n\r\nI will now give my own character, and shall do it in few words, and with\r\nmodesty and truth.\r\n\r\nI was reckoned to be as handsome as any in our neighbourhood, until I\r\nbecame pale and thin with grief and ill usage. I am still fair enough,\r\nand have, I think, no very ill feature about me. They that see me now\r\nwill hardly allow me ever to have had any great share of beauty; for\r\nbesides being so much altered, I go always mobbed and in an undress, as\r\nwell out of neglect, as indeed for want of clothes to appear in. I might\r\nadd to all this, that I was born to a good estate, although it now\r\nturneth to little account under the oppressions I endure, and hath been\r\nthe true cause of all my misfortunes.[64]\r\n\r\nSome years ago, this gentleman taking a fancy either to my person or\r\nfortune, made his addresses to me; which, being then young and foolish,\r\nI too readily admitted; he seemed to use me with so much tenderness, and\r\nhis conversation was so very engaging, that all my constancy and virtue\r\nwere too soon overcome; and, to dwell no longer upon a theme that\r\ncauseth such bitter reflections, I must confess with shame, that I was\r\nundone by the common arts practised upon all easy credulous virgins,\r\nhalf by force, and half by consent, after solemn vows and protestations\r\nof marriage. When he had once got possession, he soon began to play the\r\nusual part of a too fortunate lover, affecting on all occasions to shew\r\nhis authority, and to act like a conqueror. First, he found fault with\r\nthe government of my family, which I grant, was none of the best,\r\nconsisting of ignorant illiterate creatures; for at that time, I knew\r\nbut little of the world. In compliance to him, therefore, I agreed to\r\nfall into his ways and methods of living; I consented that his\r\nsteward[65] should govern my house, and have liberty to employ an\r\nunder-steward,[66] who should receive his directions. My lover proceeded\r\nfurther, turning away several old servants and tenants, and supplying me\r\nwith others from his own house. These grew so domineering and\r\nunreasonable, that there was no quiet, and I heard of nothing but\r\nperpetual quarrels, which although I could not possibly help, yet my\r\nlover laid all the blame and punishment upon me; and upon every falling\r\nout, still turned away more of my people, and supplied me in their stead\r\nwith a number of fellows and dependents of his own, whom he had no other\r\nway to provide for.[67] Overcome by love and to avoid noise and\r\ncontention, I yielded to all his usurpations, and finding it in vain to\r\nresist, I thought it my best policy to make my court to my new servants,\r\nand draw them to my interests; I fed them from my own table with the\r\nbest I had, put my new tenants on the choice parts of my land, and\r\ntreated them all so kindly, that they began to love me as well as their\r\nmaster. In process of time, all my old servants were gone, and I had not\r\na creature about me, nor above one or two tenants but what were of his\r\nchoosing; yet I had the good luck by gentle usage to bring over the\r\ngreatest part of them to my side. When my lover observed this, he began\r\nto alter his language; and, to those who enquired about me, he would\r\nanswer, that I was an old dependant upon his family, whom he had placed\r\non some concerns of his own; and he began to use me accordingly,\r\nneglecting by degrees all common civility in his behaviour. I shall\r\nnever forget the speech he made me one morning, which he delivered with\r\nall the gravity in the world. He put me in the mind of the vast\r\nobligations I lay under to him, in sending me so many of his people for\r\nmy own good, and to teach me manners: That it had cost him ten times\r\nmore than I was worth, to maintain me: That it had been much better for\r\nhim, if I had been damned, or burnt, or sunk to the bottom of the sea:\r\nThat it was but reasonable I should strain myself as far as I was able,\r\nto reimburse him some of his charges: That from henceforward he expected\r\nhis word should be a law to me in all things: That I must maintain a\r\nparish-watch against thieves and robbers, and give salaries to an\r\noverseer, a constable, and others, all of his own choosing, whom he\r\nwould send from time to time to be spies upon me: That to enable me the\r\nbetter in supporting these expenses, my tenants shall be obliged to\r\ncarry all their goods cross the river to his town-market, and pay toll\r\non both sides, and then sell them at half value.[68] But because we were\r\na nasty sort of people, and that he could not endure to touch anything\r\nwe had a hand in, and likewise, because he wanted work to employ his own\r\nfolks, therefore we must send all our goods to his market just in their\r\nnaturals;[69] the milk immediately from the cow without making it into\r\ncheese or butter; the corn in the ear, the grass as it is mowed; the\r\nwool as it cometh from the sheep's back, and bring the fruit upon the\r\nbranch, that he might not be obliged to eat it after our filthy hands:\r\nThat if a tenant carried but a piece of bread and cheese to eat by the\r\nway, or an inch of worsted to mend his stockings, he should forfeit his\r\nwhole parcel: And because a company of rogues usually plied on the river\r\nbetween us, who often robbed my tenants of their goods and boats, he\r\nordered a waterman of his to guard them, whose manner was to be out of\r\nthe way until the poor wretches were plundered; then to overtake the\r\nthieves, and seize all as lawful prize to his master and himself. It\r\nwould be endless to repeat a hundred other hardships he hath put upon\r\nme; but it is a general rule, that whenever he imagines the smallest\r\nadvantage will redound to one of his footboys by any new oppression of\r\nme and my whole family and estate, he never disputeth it a moment. All\r\nthis hath rendered me so very insignificant and contemptible at home,\r\nthat some servants to whom I pay the greatest wages, and many tenants\r\nwho have the most beneficial leases, are gone over to live with him; yet\r\nI am bound to continue their wages, and pay their rents;[70] by which\r\nmeans one third part of my whole income is spent on his estate, and\r\nabove another third by his tolls and markets; and my poor tenants are so\r\nsunk and impoverished, that, instead of maintaining me suitably to my\r\nquality, they can hardly find me clothes to keep me warm, or provide the\r\ncommon necessaries of life for themselves.\r\n\r\nMatters being in this posture between me and my lover; I received\r\nintelligence that he had been for some time making very pressing\r\novertures of marriage to my rival, until there happened some\r\nmisunderstandings between them; she gave him ill words, and threatened\r\nto break off all commerce with him. He, on the other side, having either\r\nacquired courage by his triumphs over me, or supposing her as tame a\r\nfool as I, thought at first to carry it with a high hand; but hearing at\r\nthe same time, that she had thoughts of making some private proposals to\r\njoin with me against him, and doubting, with very good reason, that I\r\nwould readily accept them, he seemed very much disconcerted.[71] This I\r\nthought was a proper occasion to shew some great example of generosity\r\nand love, and so, without further consideration, I sent him word, that\r\nhearing there was likely to be a quarrel between him and my rival;\r\nnotwithstanding all that had passed, and without binding him to any\r\nconditions in my own favour, I would stand by him against her and all\r\nthe world, while I had a penny in my purse, or a petticoat to pawn. This\r\nmessage was subscribed by all my chief tenants; and proved so powerful,\r\nthat my rival immediately grew more tractable upon it. The result of\r\nwhich was, that there is now a treaty of marriage concluded between\r\nthem,[72] the wedding clothes are bought, and nothing remaineth but to\r\nperform the ceremony, which is put off for some days, because they\r\ndesign it to be a public wedding. And to reward my love, constancy, and\r\ngenerosity, he hath bestowed on me the office of being sempstress to his\r\ngrooms and footmen, which I am forced to accept or starve.[73] Yet, in\r\nthe midst of this my situation, I cannot but have some pity for this\r\ndeluded man, to cast himself away on an infamous creature, who, whatever\r\nshe pretendeth, I can prove, would at this very minute rather be a whore\r\nto a certain great man, that shall be nameless, if she might have her\r\nwill.[74] For my part, I think, and so doth all the country too, that\r\nthe man is possessed; at least none of us are able to imagine what he\r\ncan possibly see in her, unless she hath bewitched him, or given him\r\nsome powder.\r\n\r\nI am sure, I never sought his alliance, and you can bear me witness,\r\nthat I might have had other matches; nay, if I were lightly disposed, I\r\ncould still perhaps have offers, that some, who hold their heads higher,\r\nwould be glad to accept.[75] But alas! I never had any such wicked\r\nthought; all I now desire is, only to enjoy a little quiet, to be free\r\nfrom the persecutions of this unreasonable man, and that he will let me\r\nmanage my own little fortune to the best advantage; for which I will\r\nundertake to pay him a considerable pension every year, much more\r\nconsiderable than what he now gets by his oppressions; for he must needs\r\nfind himself a loser at last, when he hath drained me and my tenants so\r\ndry, that we shall not have a penny for him or ourselves. There is one\r\nimposition of his, I had almost forgot, which I think unsufferable, and\r\nwill appeal to you or any reasonable person, whether it be so or not. I\r\ntold you before, that by an old compact we agreed to have the same\r\nsteward, at which time I consented likewise to regulate my family and\r\nestate by the same method with him, which he then shewed me writ down\r\nin form, and I approved of.[76] Now, the turn he thinks fit to give this\r\ncompact of ours is very extraordinary; for he pretends that whatever\r\norders he shall think fit to prescribe for the future in his family, he\r\nmay, if he will, compel mine to observe them, without asking my advice,\r\nor hearing my reasons. So that, I must not make a lease without his\r\nconsent, or give any directions for the well-governing of my family, but\r\nwhat he countermands whenever he pleaseth. This leaveth me at such\r\nconfusion and uncertainty, that my servants know not when to obey me,\r\nand my tenants, although many of them be very well inclined, seem quite\r\nat a loss.\r\n\r\nBut I am too tedious upon this melancholy subject, which however, I\r\nhope, you will forgive, since the happiness of my whole life dependeth\r\nupon it. I desire you will think a while, and give your best advice what\r\nmeasures I shall take with prudence, justice, courage, and honour, to\r\nprotect my liberty and fortune against the hardships and severities I\r\nlie under from that unkind, inconstant man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER TO THE INJURED LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAM,\r\n\r\nI have received your Ladyship's letter, and carefully considered every\r\npart of it, and shall give you my opinion how you ought to proceed for\r\nyour own security. But first, I must beg leave to tell your Ladyship,\r\nthat you were guilty of an unpardonable weakness t'other day in making\r\nthat offer to your lover, of standing by him in any quarrel he might\r\nhave with your rival. You know very well, that she began to apprehend he\r\nhad designs of using her as he had done you; and common prudence might\r\nhave directed you rather to have entered into some measures with her for\r\njoining against him, until he might at least be brought to some\r\nreasonable terms: But your invincible hatred to that lady hath carried\r\nyour resentments so high, as to be the cause of your ruin; yet, if you\r\nplease to consider, this aversion of yours began a good while before she\r\nbecame your rival, and was taken up by you and your family in a sort of\r\ncompliment to your lover, who formerly had a great abhorrence for her.\r\nIt is true, since that time you have suffered very much by her\r\nencroachments upon your estate,[77] but she never pretended to govern or\r\ndirect you: And now you have drawn a new enemy upon yourself; for I\r\nthink you may count upon all the ill offices she can possibly do you by\r\nher credit with her husband; whereas, if, instead of openly declaring\r\nagainst her without any provocation, you had but sat still awhile, and\r\nsaid nothing, that gentleman would have lessened his severity to you out\r\nof perfect fear. This weakness of yours, you call generosity; but I\r\ndoubt there was more in the matter. In short, Madam, I have good\r\nreasons to think you were betrayed to it by the pernicious counsels of\r\nsome about you: For to my certain knowledge, several of your tenants and\r\nservants, to whom you have been very kind, are as arrant rascals as any\r\nin the Country. I cannot but observe what a mighty difference there is\r\nin one particular between your Ladyship and your rival. Having yielded\r\nup your person, you thought nothing else worth defending, and therefore\r\nyou will not now insist upon those very conditions for which you yielded\r\nat first. But your Ladyship cannot be ignorant, that some years since\r\nyour rival did the same thing, and upon no conditions at all; nay, this\r\ngentleman kept her as a miss, and yet made her pay for her diet and\r\nlodging.[78] But, it being at a time when he had no steward, and his\r\nfamily out of order, she stole away, and hath now got the trick very\r\nwell known among the women of the town, to grant a man the favour over\r\nnight and the next day have the impudence to deny it to his face. But,\r\nit is too late to reproach you with any former oversights, which cannot\r\nnow be rectified. I know the matters of fact as you relate them are true\r\nand fairly represented. My advice therefore is this. Get your tenants\r\ntogether as soon as you conveniently can, and make them agree to the\r\nfollowing resolutions.\r\n\r\n_First_, That your family and tenants have no dependence upon the said\r\ngentleman, further than by the old agreement, which obligeth you to have\r\nthe same steward, and to regulate your household by such methods as you\r\nshould both agree to.[79]\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, That you will not carry your goods to the market of his\r\ntown, unless you please, nor be hindered from carrying them anywhere\r\nelse.[80]\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, That the servants you pay wages to shall live at home, or\r\nforfeit their places.[81]\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, That whatever lease you make to a tenant, it shall not be in\r\nhis power to break it.[82]\r\n\r\nIf he will agree to these articles, I advise you to contribute as\r\nlargely as you can to all charges of Parish and County.\r\n\r\nI can assure you, several of that gentleman's ablest tenants and\r\nservants are against his severe usage of you, and would be glad of an\r\noccasion to convince the rest of their error, if you will not be wanting\r\nto yourself.\r\n\r\nIf the gentleman refuses these just and reasonable offers, pray let me\r\nknow it, and perhaps I may think of something else that will be more\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\n  I am,\r\n    Madam,\r\n      Your Ladyship's, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN\r\n\r\nANSWER TO A PAPER,\r\n\r\nCALLED\r\n\r\n\"A MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nPOOR INHABITANTS, TRADESMEN, AND LABOURERS OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND.\"\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1728.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     This is, perhaps, as trenchant and fine a piece of writing as is to\r\n     be found in any of those pamphlets Swift wrote for the alleviation\r\n     of the miserable condition of Ireland. The author of the \"Memorial\"\r\n     to which Swift made this passionate reply was Sir John Browne, and\r\n     the purport of his writing may be easily gathered from Swift's\r\n     animadversions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text here given is based on that printed by Faulkner in 1735 in\r\n     the fourth volume of his collected edition of Swift's works. Scott\r\n     reprints Browne's \"Memorial\" and his reply to the present \"Answer,\"\r\n     but they are of little importance and in no way assist us in our\r\n     appreciation of Swift's work. The date of Swift's answer is given\r\n     by Faulkner as \"March 25th, 1728,\" which year Scott misprints 1738,\r\n     evidently a printer's error, though the arrangement of the order of\r\n     the pamphlets in his edition leaves much to be desired.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANSWER TO A PAPER, CALLED\r\n\r\n\"A MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nPOOR INHABITANTS, TRADESMEN, AND LABOURERS OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI received a paper from you, wherever you are, printed without any name\r\nof author or printer, and sent, I suppose, to me among others, without\r\nany particular distinction. It contains a complaint of the dearness of\r\ncorn, and some schemes of making it cheaper which I cannot approve of.\r\n\r\nBut pray permit me, before I go further, to give you a short history of\r\nthe steps by which we arrived at this hopeful situation.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, the shameful practice of too many Irish farmers, to wear\r\nout their ground with ploughing; while, either through poverty,\r\nlaziness, or ignorance, they neither took care to manure it as they\r\nought, nor gave time to any part of the land to recover itself; and,\r\nwhen their leases are near expiring, being assured that their landlords\r\nwould not renew, they ploughed even the meadows, and made such a havock,\r\nthat many landlords were considerable sufferers by it.\r\n\r\nThis gave birth to that abominable race of graziers, who, upon\r\nexpiration of the farmer's leases were ready to engross great quantities\r\nof land; and the gentlemen having been before often ill paid, and their\r\nland worn out of heart, were too easily tempted, when a rich grazier\r\nmade him an offer to take all his land, and give his security for\r\npayment. Thus a vast tract of land, where twenty or thirty farmers\r\nlived, together with their cottagers and labourers in their several\r\ncabins, became all desolate, and easily managed by one or two herdsmen\r\nand their boys; whereby the master-grazier, with little trouble, seized\r\nto himself the livelihood of a hundred people.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, that the farmers were justly punished for their\r\nknavery, brutality, and folly. But neither are the squires and landlords\r\nto be excused; for to them is owing the depopulating of the country, the\r\nvast number of beggars, and the ruin of those few sorry improvements we\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThat farmers should be limited in ploughing is very reasonable, and\r\npractised in England, and might have easily been done here by penal\r\nclauses in their leases; but to deprive them, in a manner, altogether\r\nfrom tilling their lands, was a most stupid want of thinking.\r\n\r\nHad the farmers been confined to plough a certain quantity of land, with\r\na penalty of ten pounds an acre for whatever they exceeded, and farther\r\nlimited for the three or four last years of their leases, all this evil\r\nhad been prevented; the nation would have saved a million of money, and\r\nbeen more populous by above two hundred thousand souls.\r\n\r\nFor a people, denied the benefit of trade, to manage their lands in such\r\na manner as to produce nothing but what they are forbidden to trade\r\nwith,[83] or only such things as they can neither export nor manufacture\r\nto advantage, is an absurdity that a wild Indian would be ashamed of;\r\nespecially when we add, that we are content to purchase this hopeful\r\ncommerce, by sending to foreign markets for our daily bread.\r\n\r\nThe grazier's employment is to feed great flocks of sheep, or black\r\ncattle, or both. With regard to sheep, as folly is usually accompanied\r\nwith perverseness, so it is here. There is something so monstrous to\r\ndeal in a commodity (further than for our own use) which we are not\r\nallowed to export manufactured, nor even unmanufactured, but to one\r\ncertain country, and only to some few ports in that country;[84] there\r\nis, I say, something so sottish, that it wants a name in our language\r\nto express it by: and the good of it is, that the more sheep we have,\r\nthe fewer human creatures are left to wear the wool, or eat the flesh.\r\nAjax was mad, when he mistook a flock of sheep for his enemies; but we\r\nshall never be sober, until we have the same way of thinking.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the grazier's business is, what we call black-cattle,\r\nproducing hides, tallow, and beef for exportation: all which are good\r\nand useful commodities, if rightly managed. But it seems, the greatest\r\npart of the hides are sent out raw, for want of bark to tan them; and\r\nthat want will daily grow stronger; for I doubt the new project of\r\ntanning without it is at an end. Our beef, I am afraid, still continues\r\nscandalous in foreign markets, for the old reasons. But our tallow, for\r\nanything I know, may be good. However, to bestow the whole kingdom on\r\nbeef and mutton, and thereby drive out half the people who should eat\r\ntheir share, and force the rest to send sometimes as far as Egypt for\r\nbread to eat with it, is a most peculiar and distinguished piece of\r\npublic economy, of which I have no comprehension.\r\n\r\nI know very well that our ancestors the Scythians, and their posterity\r\nour kinsmen the Tartars, lived upon the blood, and milk, and raw flesh\r\nof their cattle, without one grain of corn; but I confess myself so\r\ndegenerate, that I am not easy without bread to my victuals.\r\n\r\nWhat amazed me for a week or two, was to see, in this prodigious plenty\r\nof cattle, and dearth of human creatures, and want of bread, as well as\r\nmoney to buy it, that all kind of flesh-meat should be monstrously dear,\r\nbeyond what was ever known in this kingdom. I thought it a defect in the\r\nlaws, that there was not some regulation in the price of flesh, as well\r\nas bread: but I imagine myself to have guessed out the reason: In short,\r\nI am apt to think that the whole kingdom is overstocked with cattle,\r\nboth black and white; and as it is observed, that the poor Irish have a\r\nvanity to be rather owners of two lean cows, than one fat, although\r\nwith double the charge of grazing, and but half the quantity of milk; so\r\nI conceive it much more difficult at present to find a fat bullock or\r\nwether, than it would be if half of both were fairly knocked on the\r\nhead: for I am assured that the district in the several markets called\r\nCarrion Row is as reasonable as the poor can desire; only the\r\ncircumstance of money to purchase it, and of trade, or labour, to\r\npurchase that money, are indeed wholly wanting.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, to return more particularly to you and your memorial.\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand barrels of wheat, you say, should be imported hither;\r\nand ten thousand pounds premium to the importers. Have you looked into\r\nthe purse of the nation? I am no commissioner of the treasury; but am\r\nwell assured that the whole running cash would not supply you with a sum\r\nto purchase so much corn, which, only at twenty shillings a barrel, will\r\nbe a hundred thousand pounds; and ten thousand more for the premiums.\r\nBut you will traffic for your corn with other goods: and where are those\r\ngoods? if you had them, they are all engaged to pay the rents of\r\nabsentees, and other occasions in London, besides a huge balance of\r\ntrade this year against us. Will foreigners take our bankers' papers? I\r\nsuppose they will value it at little more than so much a quire. Where\r\nare these rich farmers and engrossers of corn, in so bad a year, and so\r\nlittle sowing?\r\n\r\nYou are in pain of two shillings premium, and forget the twenty\r\nshillings for the price; find me out the latter, and I will engage for\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nYour scheme for a tax for raising such a sum is all visionary, and owing\r\nto a great want of knowledge in the _miserable state_ of this nation.\r\nTea, coffee, sugar, spices, wine, and foreign clothes, are the\r\nparticulars you mention upon which this tax should be raised. I will\r\nallow the two first; because they are unwholesome; and the last, because\r\nI should be glad if they were all burned: but I beg you will leave us\r\nour wine to make us a while forget our misery; or give your tenants\r\nleave to plough for barley. But I will tell you a secret, which I\r\nlearned many years ago from the commissioners of the customs in London:\r\nthey said, when any commodity appeared to be taxed above a moderate\r\nrate, the consequence was, to lessen that branch of the revenue by one\r\nhalf; and one of those gentlemen pleasantly told me, that the mistake of\r\nparliaments, on such occasions, was owing to an error of computing two\r\nand two to make four; whereas, in the business of laying impositions,\r\ntwo and two never made more than one; which happens by lessening the\r\nimport, and the strong temptation of running such goods as paid high\r\nduties. At least in this kingdom, although the women are as vain and\r\nextravagant as their lovers or their husbands can deserve, and the men\r\nare fond enough of wine; yet the number of both who can afford such\r\nexpenses is so small, that the major part must refuse gratifying\r\nthemselves, and the duties will rather be lessened than increased. But,\r\nallowing no force in this argument; yet so preternatural a sum as one\r\nhundred and ten thousand pounds, raised all on a sudden, (for there is\r\nno dallying with hunger,) is just in proportion with raising a million\r\nand a half in England; which, as things now stand, would probably bring\r\nthat opulent kingdom under some difficulties.\r\n\r\nYou are concerned how strange and surprising it would be in foreign\r\nparts to hear that the poor were starving in a RICH country,\r\n&c. Are you in earnest? Is Ireland the rich country you mean? Or are you\r\ninsulting our poverty? Were you ever out of Ireland? Or were you ever in\r\nit till of late? You may probably have a good employment, and are saving\r\nall you can to purchase a good estate in England. But by talking so\r\nfamiliarly of one hundred and ten thousand pounds, by a tax upon a few\r\ncommodities, it is plain you are either naturally or affectedly ignorant\r\nof our present condition: or else you would know and allow, that such a\r\nsum is not to be raised here, without a general excise; since, in\r\nproportion to our wealth, we pay already in taxes more than England ever\r\ndid in the height of the war. And when you have brought over your corn,\r\nwho will be the buyers? Most certainly not the poor, who will not be\r\nable to purchase the twentieth part of it.\r\n\r\nSir, upon the whole, your paper is a very crude piece, liable to more\r\nobjections than there are lines; but I think your meaning is good, and\r\nso far you are pardonable.\r\n\r\nIf you will propose a general contribution in supporting the poor in\r\npotatoes and butter-milk, till the new corn comes in, perhaps you may\r\nsucceed better, because the thing at least is possible; and I think if\r\nour brethren in England would contribute upon this emergency, out of the\r\nmillion they gain from us every year, they would do a piece of justice\r\nas well as charity. In the mean time, go and preach to your own tenants,\r\nto fall to the plough as fast as they can; and prevail with your\r\nneighbouring squires to do the same with theirs; or else die with the\r\nguilt of having driven away half the inhabitants, and starving the rest.\r\nFor as to your scheme of raising one hundred and ten thousand pounds, it\r\nis as vain as that of Rabelais; which was, to squeeze out wind from the\r\nposteriors of a dead ass.\r\n\r\nBut why all this concern for the poor? We want them not, as the country\r\nis now managed; they may follow thousands of their leaders, and seek\r\ntheir bread abroad. Where the plough has no work, one family can do the\r\nbusiness of fifty, and you may send away the other forty-nine. An\r\nadmirable piece of husbandry, never known or practised by the wisest\r\nnations, who erroneously thought people to be the riches of a country!\r\n\r\nIf so wretched a state of things would allow it, methinks I could have a\r\nmalicious pleasure, after all the warning I have in vain given the\r\npublic, at my own peril, for several years past, to see the consequences\r\nand events answering in every particular. I pretend to no sagacity: what\r\nI writ was little more than what I had discoursed to several persons,\r\nwho were generally of my opinion; and it was obvious to every common\r\nunderstanding, that such effects must needs follow from such causes;--a\r\nfair issue of things begun upon party rage, while some sacrificed the\r\npublic to fury, and others to ambition: while a spirit of faction and\r\noppression reigned in every part of the country, where gentlemen,\r\ninstead of consulting the ease of their tenants, or cultivating their\r\nlands, were worrying one another upon points of Whig and Tory, of High\r\nChurch and Low Church; which no more concerned them than the long and\r\nfamous controversy of strops for razors: while agriculture was wholly\r\ndiscouraged, and consequently half the farmers and labourers, and poorer\r\ntradesmen, forced to beggary or banishment. \"Wisdom crieth in the\r\nstreets: Because I have called on ye; I have stretched out my hand, and\r\nno man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsels, and would\r\nnone of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity, and mock when\r\nyour fear cometh.\"\r\n\r\nI have now done with your Memorial, and freely excuse your mistakes,\r\nsince you appear to write as a stranger, and as of a country which is\r\nleft at liberty to enjoy the benefits of nature, and to make the best of\r\nthose advantages which God hath given it, in soil, climate, and\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nBut having lately sent out a paper, entitled, _A Short View of the State\r\nof Ireland_; and hearing of an objection, that some people think I have\r\ntreated the memory of the late Lord Chief Justice Whitshed with an\r\nappearance of severity; since I may not probably have another\r\nopportunity of explaining myself in that particular, I choose to do it\r\nhere. Laying it, therefore, down for a postulatum, which I suppose will\r\nbe universally granted, that no little creature of so mean a birth and\r\ngenius, had ever the honour to be a greater enemy to his country, and to\r\nall kinds of virtue, than HE, I answer thus; Whether there be two\r\ndifferent goddesses called Fame, as some authors contend, or only one\r\ngoddess sounding two different trumpets, it is certain that people\r\ndistinguished for their villainy have as good a title for a blast from\r\nthe proper trumpet, as those who are most renowned for their virtues\r\nhave from the other; and have equal reason to complain if it be refused\r\nthem. And accordingly the names of the most celebrated profligates have\r\nbeen faithfully transmitted down to posterity. And although the person\r\nhere understood acted his part in an obscure corner of the world, yet\r\nhis talents might have shone with lustre enough in the noblest scene.\r\n\r\nAs to my naming a person dead, the plain honest reason is the best. He\r\nwas armed with power, guilt, and will to do mischief, even where he was\r\nnot provoked, as appeared by his prosecuting two printers,[85] one to\r\ndeath, and both to ruin, who had neither offended God nor the King, nor\r\nhim nor the public.\r\n\r\nWhat an encouragement to vice is this! If an ill man be alive, and in\r\npower, we dare not attack him; and if he be weary of the world, or of\r\nhis own villainies, he has nothing to do but die, and then his\r\nreputation is safe. For these excellent casuists know just Latin enough\r\nto have heard a most foolish precept, that _de mortuis nil nisi bonum_;\r\nso that if Socrates, and Anytus his accuser, had happened to die\r\ntogether, the charity of survivors must either have obliged them to hold\r\ntheir peace, or to fix the same character on both. The only crime of\r\ncharging the dead is, when the least doubt remains whether the\r\naccusation be true; but when men are openly abandoned, and lost to all\r\nshame, they have no reason to think it hard if their memory be\r\nreproached. Whoever reports, or otherwise publisheth, any thing which it\r\nis possible may be false, that man is a slanderer; _hic niger est, hunc\r\ntu, Romane, caveto_. Even the least misrepresentation, or aggravation of\r\nfacts, deserves the same censure, in some degree, but in this case, I am\r\nquite deceived if my error hath not been on the side of extenuation.\r\n\r\nI have now present before me the idea of some persons (I know not in\r\nwhat part of the world) who spend every moment of their lives, and every\r\nturn of their thoughts, while they are awake, (and probably of their\r\ndreams while they sleep,) in the most detestable actions and designs;\r\nwho delight in mischief, scandal, and obloquy, with the hatred and\r\ncontempt of all mankind against them, but chiefly of those among their\r\nown party and their own family; such whose odious qualities rival each\r\nother for perfection: avarice, brutality, faction, pride, malice,\r\ntreachery, noise, impudence, dullness, ignorance, vanity, and revenge,\r\ncontending every moment for superiority in their breasts. Such creatures\r\nare not to be reformed, neither is it prudence or safety to attempt a\r\nreformation. Yet, although their memories will rot, there may be some\r\nbenefit for their survivors to smell it while it is rotting.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, Sir,\r\n                                     Your humble servant,\r\n                                                      A. B.\r\n\r\n  Dublin,\r\n       March 25th, 1728.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nTO SEVERAL LETTERS FROM UNKNOWN\r\n\r\nPERSONS.[86]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1729.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO SEVERAL LETTERS FROM UNKNOWN PERSONS.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that I received a letter from you two, last\r\nsummer, directed to Dublin, while I was in the country, whither it was\r\nsent me; and I ordered an answer to it to be printed, but it seems it\r\nhad little effect, and I suppose this will have not much more. But the\r\nheart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing,\r\nand their eyes they have closed. And, gentlemen, I am to tell you\r\nanother thing: That the world is so regardless of what we write for the\r\npublic good, that after we have delivered our thoughts, without any\r\nprospect of advantage, or of reputation, which latter is not to be had\r\nbut by subscribing our names, we cannot prevail upon a printer to be at\r\nthe charge of sending it into the world, unless we will be at all or\r\nhalf the expense; and although we are willing enough to bestow our\r\nlabours, we think it unreasonable to be out of pocket; because it\r\nprobably may not consist with the situation of our affairs.\r\n\r\nI do very much approve your good intentions, and in a great measure your\r\nmanner of declaring them; and I do imagine you intended that the world\r\nshould not only know your sentiments, but my answer, which I shall\r\nimpartially give.\r\n\r\nThat great prelate, to whose care you directed your letter, sent it to\r\nme this morning;[88] and I begin my answer to-night, not knowing what\r\ninterruption I may meet with.\r\n\r\nI have ordered your letter to be printed, as it ought to be, along with\r\nmy answer; because I conceive it will be more acceptable and informing\r\nto the kingdom.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore now go on to answer your letter in all manner of\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nAlthough your letter be directed to me, yet I take myself to be only an\r\nimaginary person; for, although I conjecture I had formerly one from\r\nyou, yet I never answered it otherwise than in print; neither was I at a\r\nloss to know the reasons why so many people of this kingdom were\r\ntransporting themselves to America. And if this encouragement were owing\r\nto a pamphlet written, giving an account of the country of Pennsylvania,\r\nto tempt people to go thither, I do declare that those who were tempted,\r\nby such a narrative, to such a journey, were fools, and the author a\r\nmost impudent knave; at least, if it be the same pamphlet I saw when it\r\nfirst came out, which is above 25 years ago, dedicated to Will Penn\r\n(whom by a mistake you call \"Sir William Penn,\") and styling him, by\r\nauthority of the Scripture, \"Most Noble Governor.\" For I was very well\r\nacquainted with Penn, and did, some years after, talk with him upon that\r\npamphlet, and the impudence of the author, who spoke so many things in\r\npraise of the soil and climate, which Penn himself did absolutely\r\ncontradict. For he did assure me that his country wanted the shelter of\r\nmountains, which left it open to the northern winds from Hudson's Bay\r\nand the Frozen Sea, which destroyed all plantations of trees, and was\r\neven pernicious to all common vegetables. But, indeed, New York,\r\nVirginia, and other parts less northward, or more defended by mountains,\r\nare described as excellent countries: but, upon what conditions of\r\nadvantage foreigners go thither, I am yet to seek.[89]\r\n\r\nWhat evils do our people avoid by running from hence, is easier to be\r\ndetermined. They conceive themselves to live under the tyranny of most\r\ncruel exacting landlords, who have no view further than increasing their\r\nrent-rolls. Secondly, you complain of the want of trade, whereof you\r\nseem not to know the reason. Thirdly, you lament most justly the money\r\nspent by absentees in England. Fourthly, you complain that your linen\r\nmanufacture declines. Fifthly, that your tithe-collectors oppress you.\r\nSixthly, that your children have no hopes of preferment in the church,\r\nthe revenue, or the army; to which you might have added the law, and all\r\ncivil employments whatsoever. Seventhly, you are undone for silver, and\r\nwant all other money.\r\n\r\nI could easily add some other motives, which, to men of spirit, who\r\ndesire and expect, and think they deserve the common privileges of human\r\nnature, would be of more force, than any you have yet named, to drive\r\nthem out of this kingdom. But, as these speculations may probably not\r\nmuch affect the brains of your people, I shall choose to let them pass\r\nunmentioned. Yet I cannot but observe, that my very good and virtuous\r\nfriend, his excellency Burnet, (_O fili, nec tali indigne parente!_)[90]\r\nhath not hitherto been able to persuade his vassals, by his oratory in\r\nthe style of a command, to settle a revenue on his viceroyal person.[91]\r\nI have been likewise assured, that in one of those colonies on the\r\ncontinent, which nature hath so far favoured, as (by the industry of the\r\ninhabitants) to produce a great quantity of excellent rice, the\r\nstubbornness of the people, who having been told that the world is wide,\r\ntook it into their heads that they might sell their own rice at whatever\r\nforeign markets they pleased, and seem, by their practice, very\r\nunwilling to quit that opinion.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to my subject: I must confess to you both, that if one\r\nreason of your people's deserting us be, the despair of things growing\r\nbetter in their own country, I have not one syllable to answer; because\r\nthat would be to hope for what is impossible; and so I have been telling\r\nthe public these ten years. For there are three events which must\r\nprecede any such blessing: First, a liberty of trade; secondly, a share\r\nof preferments in all kinds, to the British natives; and thirdly, a\r\nreturn of those absentees, who take almost one half of the kingdom's\r\nrevenues. As to the first, there is nothing left us but despair; and for\r\nthe third, it will never happen till the kingdom hath no money to send\r\nthem; for which, in my own particular, I should not be sorry.\r\n\r\nThe exaction of landlords hath indeed been a grievance of above twenty\r\nyears' standing. But as to what you object about the severe clauses\r\nrelating to improvement, the fault lies wholly on the other side: for\r\nthe landlords, either by their ignorance, or greediness of making large\r\nrent-rolls, have performed this matter so ill, as we see by experience,\r\nthat there is not one tenant in five hundred who hath made any\r\nimprovement worth mentioning. For which I appeal to any man who rides\r\nthrough the kingdom, where little is to be found among the tenants but\r\nbeggary and desolation; the cabins of the Scotch themselves, in Ulster,\r\nbeing as dirty and miserable as those of the wildest Irish. Whereas good\r\nfirm penal clauses for improvement, with a tolerable easy rent, and a\r\nreasonable period of time, would, in twenty years, have increased the\r\nrents of Ireland at least a third part in the intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear you speak with some decency of the clergy, and to\r\nimpute the exactions you lament to the managers or farmers of the\r\ntithes. But you entirely mistake the fact; for I defy the most wicked\r\nand most powerful clergymen in the kingdom to oppress the meanest farmer\r\nin the parish; and I likewise defy the same clergyman to prevent himself\r\nfrom being cheated by the same farmer, whenever that farmer shall be\r\ndisposed to be knavish or peevish. For, although the Ulster\r\ntithing-teller is more advantageous to the clergy than any other in the\r\nkingdom, yet the minister can demand no more than his tenth; and where\r\nthe corn much exceeds the small tithes, as, except in some districts, I\r\nam told it always doth, he is at the mercy of every stubborn farmer,\r\nespecially of those whose sect as well as interest incline them to\r\nopposition. However, I take it that your people bent for America do not\r\nshew the best part of their prudence in making this one part of their\r\ncomplaint: yet they are so far wise, as not to make the payment of\r\ntithes a scruple of conscience, which is too gross for any Protestant\r\ndissenter, except a Quaker, to pretend. But do your people indeed think,\r\nthat if tithes were abolished, or delivered into the hands of the\r\nlandlord, after the blessed manner in the Scotch spiritual economy, that\r\nthe tenant would sit easier in his rent under the same person, who must\r\nbe lord of the soil and of the tithe together?\r\n\r\nI am ready enough to grant, that the oppression of landlords, the utter\r\nruin of trade, with its necessary consequence the want of money, half\r\nthe revenues of the kingdom spent abroad, the continued dearth of three\r\nyears, and the strong delusion in your people by false allurement from\r\nAmerica, may be the chief motives of their eagerness after such an\r\nexpedition. [But there is likewise another temptation, which is not of\r\ninconsiderable weight; which is their itch of living in a country where\r\ntheir sect is predominant, and where their eyes and consciences would\r\nnot be offended by the stumbling-block of ceremonies, habits, and\r\nspiritual titles.[92]]\r\n\r\nBut I was surprised to find that those calamities, whereof we are\r\ninnocent, have been sufficient to drive many families out of their\r\ncountry, who had no reason to complain of oppressive landlords. For,\r\nwhile I was last year in the northern parts, a person of quality, whose\r\nestate was let above 20 years ago, and then at a very reasonable rent,\r\nsome for leases of lives, and some perpetuities, did, in a few months,\r\npurchase eleven of those leases at a very inconsiderable price, although\r\nthey were, two years ago, reckoned to pay but half value. From whence it\r\nis manifest, that our present miserable condition, and the dismal\r\nprospect of worse, with other reasons above assigned, are sufficient to\r\nput men upon trying this desperate experiment, of changing the scene\r\nthey are in, although landlords should, by a miracle, become less\r\ninhuman.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a scheme proposed for improving the trade of this\r\nkingdom, which doth not manifestly shew the stupidity and ignorance of\r\nthe proposer; and I laugh with contempt at those weak wise heads, who\r\nproceed upon general maxims, or advise us to follow the examples of\r\nHolland and England. These empirics talk by rote, without understanding\r\nthe constitution of the kingdom: as if a physician, knowing that\r\nexercise contributed much to health, should prescribe to his patient\r\nunder a severe fit of the gout, to walk ten miles every morning. The\r\ndirections for Ireland are very short and plain; to encourage\r\nagriculture and home consumption, and utterly discard all importations\r\nwhich are not absolutely necessary for health or life. And how few\r\nnecessities, conveniences, or even comforts of life, are denied us by\r\nnature, or not to be attained by labour and industry! Are those\r\ndetestable extravagancies of Flanders lace, English cloths of our own\r\nwool, and other goods, Italian or Indian silks, tea, coffee, chocolate,\r\nchina-ware, and that profusion of wines, by the knavery of merchants\r\ngrowing dearer every season, with a hundred unnecessary fopperies,\r\nbetter known to others than me; are these, I say, fit for us, any more\r\nthan for the beggar who could not eat his veal without oranges? Is it\r\nnot the highest indignity to human nature, that men should be such\r\npoltroons as to suffer the kingdom and themselves to be undone, by the\r\nvanity, the folly, the pride, and wantonness of their wives,[93] who,\r\nunder their present corruptions, seem to be a kind of animal, suffered,\r\nfor our sins, to be sent into the world for the destruction of families,\r\nsocieties, and kingdoms; and whose whole study seems directed to be as\r\nexpensive as they possibly can, in every useless article of living; who,\r\nby long practice, can reconcile the most pernicious foreign drugs to\r\ntheir health and pleasure, provided they are but expensive, as starlings\r\ngrow fat with henbane; who contract a robustness by mere practice of\r\nsloth and luxury; who can play deep several hours after midnight, sleep\r\nbeyond noon, revel upon Indian poisons, and spend the revenue of a\r\nmoderate family to adorn a nauseous, unwholesome living carcase? Let\r\nthose few who are not concerned in any part of this accusation, suppose\r\nit unsaid; let the rest take it among them. Gracious God, in His mercy,\r\nlook down upon a nation so shamefully besotted!\r\n\r\nIf I am possessed of an hundred pounds a year, and by some misfortune it\r\nsinks to fifty, without a possibility of ever being retrieved; does it\r\nremain a question, in such an exigency, what I am to do? Must not I\r\nretrench one-half in every article of expense, or retire to some cheap,\r\ndistant part of the country, where necessaries are at half value?\r\n\r\nIs there any mortal who can shew me, under the circumstances we stand\r\nwith our neighbours, under their inclinations towards us, under laws\r\nnever to be repealed, under the desolation caused by absentees, under\r\nmany other circumstances not to be mentioned, that this kingdom can ever\r\nbe a nation of trade, or subsist by any other method than that of a\r\nreduced family, by the utmost parsimony, in the manner I have already\r\nprescribed?\r\n\r\nI am tired with letters from many unreasonable, well-meaning people, who\r\nare daily pressing me to deliver my thoughts in this deplorable\r\njuncture, which, upon many others, I have so often done in vain. What\r\nwill it import, that half a score people in a coffee-house may happen to\r\nread this paper, and even the majority of those few differ in every\r\nsentiment from me? If the farmer be not allowed to sow his corn; if half\r\nthe little money among us be sent to pay rents to Irish absentees, and\r\nthe rest for foreign luxury and dress for the women, what will our\r\ncharitable dispositions avail, when there is nothing left to be given?\r\nWhen, contrary to all custom and example, all necessaries of life are so\r\nexorbitant; when money of all kinds was never known to be so scarce, so\r\nthat gentlemen of no contemptible estates are forced to retrench in\r\nevery article, (except what relates to their wives,) without being able\r\nto shew any bounty to the poor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANSWER\r\n\r\nTO SEVERAL LETTERS SENT ME FROM\r\n\r\nUNKNOWN HANDS.[94]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1729.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very well pleased with the good opinion you express of me; and wish\r\nit were any way in my power to answer your expectations, for the service\r\nof my country. I have carefully read your several schemes and proposals,\r\nwhich you think should be offered to the Parliament. In answer, I will\r\nassure you, that, in another place, I have known very good proposals\r\nrejected with contempt by public assemblies, merely because they were\r\noffered from without doors; and yours, perhaps, might have the same\r\nfate, especially if handed into the public by me, who am not acquainted\r\nwith three members, nor have the least interest with one. My printers\r\nhave been twice prosecuted, to my great expense, on account of\r\ndiscourses I writ for the public service, without the least reflection\r\non parties or persons; and the success I had in those of the Drapier,\r\nwas not owing to my abilities, but to a lucky juncture, when the fuel\r\nwas ready for the first hand that would be at the pains of kindling it.\r\nIt is true, both those envenomed prosecutions were the workmanship of a\r\njudge, who is now gone _to his own place_.[95] But, let that be as it\r\nwill, I am determined, henceforth, never to be the instrument of leaving\r\nan innocent man at the mercy of that bench.\r\n\r\nIt is certain there are several particulars relating to this kingdom (I\r\nhave mentioned a few of them in one of my Drapier's letters,[96]) which\r\nit were heartily to be wished that the Parliament would take under\r\ntheir consideration, such as will nowise interfere with England,\r\notherwise than to its advantage.\r\n\r\nThe first I shall mention, is touched at in a letter which I received\r\nfrom one of you, gentlemen, about the highways; which, indeed, are\r\nalmost everywhere scandalously neglected. I know a very rich man in this\r\ncity, a true lover and saver of his money, who, being possessed of some\r\nadjacent lands, hath been at great charge in repairing effectually the\r\nroads that lead to them; and has assured me that his lands are thereby\r\nadvanced four or five shillings an acre, by which he gets treble\r\ninterest. But, generally speaking, all over the kingdom the roads are\r\ndeplorable; and, what is more particularly barbarous, there is no sort\r\nof provision made for travellers on foot; no, not near this city, except\r\nin a very few places, and in a most wretched manner: whereas the English\r\nare so particularly careful in this point, that you may travel there an\r\nhundred miles with less inconvenience than one mile here. But, since\r\nthis may be thought too great a reformation, I shall only speak of roads\r\nfor horses, carriages, and cattle.[97]\r\n\r\nIreland is, I think, computed to be one-third smaller than England; yet,\r\nby some natural disadvantages, it would not bear quite the same\r\nproportion in value, with the same encouragement. However, it hath so\r\nhappened, for many years past, that it never arrived to above\r\none-eleventh part in point of riches; and of late, by the continual\r\ndecrease of trade, and increase of absentees, with other circumstances\r\nnot here to be mentioned, hardly to a fifteenth part; at least, if my\r\ncalculations be right, which I doubt are a little too favourable on our\r\nside.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing day-labour to be cheaper by one half here than in\r\nEngland, and our roads, by the nature of our carriages, and the\r\ndesolation of our country, to be not worn and beaten above one-eighth\r\npart so much as those of England, which is a very moderate computation,\r\nI do not see why the mending of them would be a greater burthen to this\r\nkingdom than to that.\r\n\r\nThere have been, I believe, twenty acts of Parliament, in six or seven\r\nyears of the late King, for mending long tracts of impassable ways in\r\nseveral counties of England, by erecting turnpikes, and receiving\r\npassage-money, in a manner that everybody knows. If what I have advanced\r\nbe true, it would be hard to give a reason against the same practice\r\nhere; since the necessity is as great, the advantage, in proportion,\r\nperhaps much greater, the materials of stone and gravel as easy to be\r\nfound, and the workmanship, at least, twice as cheap. Besides, the work\r\nmay be done gradually, with allowances for the poverty of the nation, by\r\nso many perch a year; but with a special care to encourage skill and\r\ndiligence, and to prevent fraud in the undertakers, to which we are too\r\nliable, and which are not always confined to those of the meaner sort:\r\nbut against these, no doubt, the wisdom of the nation may and will\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\nAnother evil, which, in my opinion, deserves the public care, is the ill\r\nmanagement of the bogs; the neglect whereof is a much greater mischief\r\nto this kingdom than most people seem to be aware of.\r\n\r\nIt is allowed, indeed, by those who are esteemed most skilful in such\r\nmatters, that the red, swelling mossy bog, whereof we have so many large\r\ntracts in this island, is not by any means to be fully reduced; but the\r\nskirts, which are covered with a green coat, easily may, being not an\r\naccretion, or annual growth of moss, like the other.\r\n\r\nNow, the landlords are generally too careless that they suffer their\r\ntenants to cut their turf in these skirts, as well as the bog adjoined;\r\nwhereby there is yearly lost a considerable quantity of land throughout\r\nthe kingdom, never to be recovered.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the greatest part of the mischief: for the main bog,\r\nalthough, perhaps, not reducible to natural soil, yet, by continuing\r\nlarge, deep, straight canals through the middle, cleaned at proper times\r\nas low as the channel or gravel, would become a secure summer-pasture;\r\nthe margins might, with great profit and ornament, be filled with\r\nquickens, birch, and other trees proper for such a soil, and the canals\r\nbe convenient for water-carriage of the turf, which is now drawn upon\r\nsled-cars, with great expense, difficulty, and loss of time, by reason\r\nof the many turf-pits scattered irregularly through the bog, wherein\r\ngreat numbers of cattle are yearly drowned. And it hath been, I confess,\r\nto me a matter of the greatest vexation, as well as wonder, to think how\r\nany landlord could be so absurd as to suffer such havoc to be made.\r\n\r\nAll the acts for encouraging plantations of forest-trees are, I am told,\r\nextremely defective;[98] which, with great submission, must have been\r\nowing to a defect of skill in the contrivers of them. In this climate,\r\nby the continual blowing of the west-south-west wind, hardly any tree of\r\nvalue will come to perfection that is not planted in groves, except very\r\nrarely, and where there is much land-shelter. I have not, indeed, read\r\nall the acts; but, from enquiry, I cannot learn that the planting in\r\ngroves is enjoined. And as to the effects of these laws, I have not seen\r\nthe least, in many hundred miles riding, except about a very few\r\ngentlemen's houses, and even those with very little skill or success. In\r\nall the rest, the hedges generally miscarry, as well as the larger\r\nslender twigs planted upon the tops of ditches, merely for want of\r\ncommon skill and care.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that a greater and quicker profit could be made, than\r\nby planting large groves of ash a few feet asunder, which in seven years\r\nwould make the best kind of hop-poles, and grow in the same or less time\r\nto a second crop from their roots.\r\n\r\nIt would likewise be of great use and beauty in our desert scenes, to\r\noblige all tenants and cottagers to plant ash or elm before their\r\ncabins, and round their potato-gardens, where cattle either do not or\r\nought not to come to destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe common objections against all this, drawn from the laziness, the\r\nperverseness, or thievish disposition, of the poor native Irish, might\r\nbe easily answered, by shewing the true reasons for such accusations,\r\nand how easily those people may be brought to a less savage manner of\r\nlife: but my printers have already suffered too much for my\r\nspeculations. However, supposing the size of a native's understanding\r\njust equal to that of a dog or horse, I have often seen those two\r\nanimals to be civilized by rewards, at least as much as by punishments.\r\n\r\nIt would be a noble achievement to abolish the Irish language in this\r\nkingdom, so far at least as to oblige all the natives to speak only\r\nEnglish on every occasion of business, in shops, markets, fairs, and\r\nother places of dealing: yet I am wholly deceived, if this might not be\r\neffectually done in less than half an age, and at a very trifling\r\nexpense; for such I look upon a tax to be of only six thousand pounds a\r\nyear, to accomplish so great a work.[99] This would, in a great measure,\r\ncivilize the most barbarous among them, reconcile them to our customs\r\nand manner of living, and reduce great numbers to the national religion,\r\nwhatever kind may then happen to be established. The method is plain and\r\nsimple; and although I am too desponding to produce it, yet I could\r\nheartily wish some public thoughts were employed to reduce this\r\nuncultivated people from that idle, savage, beastly, thievish manner of\r\nlife, in which they continue sunk to a degree, that it is almost\r\nimpossible for a country gentleman to find a servant of human capacity,\r\nor the least tincture of natural honesty; or who does not live among his\r\nown tenants in continual fear of having his plantations destroyed, his\r\ncattle stolen, and his goods pilfered.\r\n\r\nThe love, affection, or vanity of living in England, continuing to carry\r\nthither so many wealthy families, the consequences thereof, together\r\nwith the utter loss of all trade, except what is detrimental, which hath\r\nforced such great numbers of weavers, and others, to seek their bread in\r\nforeign countries; the unhappy practice of stocking such vast quantities\r\nof land with sheep and other cattle, which reduceth twenty families to\r\none: these events, I say, have exceedingly depopulated this kingdom for\r\nseveral years past. I should heartily wish, therefore, under this\r\nmiserable dearth of money, that those who are most concerned would think\r\nit advisable to save a hundred thousand pounds a year, which is now sent\r\nout of this kingdom, to feed us with corn. There is not an older or more\r\nuncontroverted maxim in the politics of all wise nations, than that of\r\nencouraging agriculture: and therefore, to what kind of wisdom a\r\npractice so directly contrary among us may be reduced, I am by no means\r\na judge. If labour and people make the true riches of a nation, what\r\nmust be the issue where one part of the people are forced away, and the\r\nother part have nothing to do?\r\n\r\nIf it should be thought proper by wiser heads, that his Majesty might be\r\napplied to in a national way, for giving the kingdom leave to coin\r\nhalfpence for its own use, I believe no good subject will be under the\r\nleast apprehension that such a request could meet with refusal, or the\r\nleast delay. Perhaps we are the only kingdom upon earth, or that ever\r\nwas or will be upon earth, which did not enjoy that common right of\r\ncivil society, under the proper inspection of its prince or legislature,\r\nto coin money of all usual metals for its own occasions. Every petty\r\nprince in Germany, vassal to the Emperor, enjoys this privilege. And I\r\nhave seen in this kingdom several silver pieces, with the inscription of\r\nCIVITAS WATERFORD, DROGHEDAGH, and other towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER\r\n\r\nTO THE ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN,\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE WEAVERS.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1729.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The archbishop to whom Swift wrote was Dr. William King, for many\r\n     years his friend. King was a fine patriot and had stood out\r\n     strongly against the imposition of Wood's Halfpence. In this\r\n     letter, so characteristic of Swift's attitude towards the condition\r\n     of Ireland, he aims at a practical and immediate relief. The causes\r\n     for this condition discussed so ably by Molesworth, Prior and Dobbs\r\n     in their various treatises are too academic for him. His \"Proposal\r\n     for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture\" well illustrates the\r\n     kind of practical reform Swift insisted on. Yet the insistence was\r\n     more because of the spirit of independence such a course demanded.\r\n     To Swift there was no hope for Ireland without a radical change in\r\n     the spirit of its people. The change meant the assertion of\r\n     manliness, independence, and strength of character. How to attain\r\n     these, and how to make the people aware of their power, were always\r\n     Swift's aims. All his tracts are assertions of and dilations on\r\n     these themes. If the people were but to insist on wearing their own\r\n     manufactures, since they were prohibited from exporting them, they\r\n     would keep their money in the kingdom. Likewise, if they were to\r\n     deny themselves the indulgence in luxuries, they would not have to\r\n     send out their money to the countries from which these luxuries\r\n     were obtained. There were methods ready at hand, but the practice\r\n     in them would result in the cultivation of that respect for\r\n     themselves without which a nation is worse than a pauper and lower\r\n     than a slave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of this edition is based on the original manuscript, and\r\n     collated with that of Scott's second edition of Swift's collected\r\n     works.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN, CONCERNING THE WEAVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LORD,\r\n\r\nThe corporation of weavers in the woollen manufacture, who have so often\r\nattended your Grace, and called upon me with their schemes and proposals\r\nwere with me on Thursday last, when he who spoke for the rest and in the\r\nname of his absent brethren, said, \"It was the opinion of the whole\r\nbody, that if somewhat were written at this time by an able hand to\r\npersuade the people of the Kingdom to wear their own woollen\r\nmanufactures, it might be of good use to the Nation in general, and\r\npreserve many hundreds of their trade from starving.\" To which I\r\nanswered, \"That it was hard for any man of common spirit to turn his\r\nthoughts to such speculations, without discovering a resentment which\r\npeople are too delicate to bear.\" For, I will not deny to your Grace,\r\nthat I cannot reflect on the singular condition of this Country,\r\ndifferent from all others upon the face of the Earth, without some\r\nemotion, and without often examining as I pass the streets whether those\r\nanimals which come in my way with two legs and human faces, clad and\r\nerect, be of the same species with what I have seen very like them in\r\nEngland, as to the outward shape, but differing in their notions,\r\nnatures, and intellectuals, more than any two kinds of brutes in a\r\nforest, which any men of common prudence would immediately discover, by\r\npersuading them to define what they mean by law, liberty, property,\r\ncourage, reason, loyalty or religion.\r\n\r\nOne thing, my Lord, I am very confident of; that if God Almighty for\r\nour sins would most justly send us a pestilence, whoever should dare to\r\ndiscover his grief in public for such a visitation, would certainly be\r\ncensured for disaffection to the Government. For I solemnly profess,\r\nthat I do not know one calamity we have undergone this many years,\r\nwhereof any man whose opinions were not in fashion dared to lament\r\nwithout being openly charged with that imputation. And this is the\r\nharder, because although a mother when she hath corrected her child may\r\nsometimes force it to kiss the rod, yet she will never give that power\r\nto the footboy or the scullion.\r\n\r\nMy Lord, there are two things for the people of this Kingdom to\r\nconsider. First their present evil condition; and secondly what can be\r\ndone in some degree to remedy it.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into a particular description of our present misery;\r\nIt hath been already done in several papers, and very fully in one,\r\nentitled, \"A short View of the State of Ireland.\" It will be enough to\r\nmention the entire want of trade, the Navigation Act executed with the\r\nutmost rigour, the remission of a million every year to England, the\r\nruinous importation of foreign luxury and vanity, the oppression of\r\nlandlords, and discouragement of agriculture.\r\n\r\nNow all these evils are without the possibility of a cure except that of\r\nimportations, and to fence against ruinous folly will be always in our\r\npower in spite of the discouragements, mortifications, contempt, hatred,\r\nand oppression we can lie under. But our trade will never mend, the\r\nNavigation Act never be softened, our absentees never return, our\r\nendless foreign payments never be lessened, or our landlords ever be\r\nless exacting.\r\n\r\nAll other schemes for preserving this Kingdom from utter ruin are idle\r\nand visionary, consequently drawn from wrong reasoning, and from general\r\ntopics which for the same causes that they may be true in all Nations\r\nare certainly false in ours; as I have told the Public often enough, but\r\nwith as little effect as what I shall say at present is likely to\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nI am weary of so many abortive projects for the advancement of trade, of\r\nso many crude proposals in letters sent me from unknown hands, of so\r\nmany contradictory speculations about raising or sinking the value of\r\ngold and silver: I am not in the least sorry to hear of the great\r\nnumbers going to America, though very much so for the causes that drive\r\nthem from us, since the uncontrolled maxim, \"That people are the riches\r\nof a Nation,\" is no maxim here under our circumstances. We have neither\r\n[manufactures] to employ them about, nor food to support them.\r\n\r\nIf a private gentleman's income be sunk irretrievably for ever from a\r\nhundred pounds to fifty, and that he hath no other method to supply the\r\ndeficiency, I desire to know, my Lord, whether such a person hath any\r\nother course to take than to sink half his expenses in every article of\r\neconomy, to save himself from ruin and the gaol. Is not this more than\r\ndoubly the case of Ireland, where the want of money, the irrecoverable\r\nruin of trade, with the other evils above mentioned, and many more too\r\nwell known and felt, and too numerous or invidious to relate, have been\r\ngradually sinking us for above a dozen years past, to a degree that we\r\nare at least by two thirds in a worse condition than was ever known\r\nsince the Revolution? Therefore instead of dreams and projects for the\r\nadvancing of trade, we have nothing left but to find out some expedient\r\nwhereby we may reduce our expenses to our incomes.\r\n\r\nYet this procedure, allowed so necessary in all private families, and in\r\nits own nature so easy to be put in practice, may meet with strong\r\nopposition by the cowardly slavish indulgence of the men to the\r\nintolerable pride arrogance vanity and luxury of the women, who strictly\r\nadhering to the rules of modern education seem to employ their whole\r\nstock of invention in contriving new arts of profusion, faster than the\r\nmost parsimonious husband can afford; and to compass this work the more\r\neffectually, their universal maxim is to despise and detest everything\r\nof the growth and manufacture of their own country, and most to value\r\nwhatever comes from the very remotest parts of the globe. And I am\r\nconvinced, that if the virtuosi could once find out a world in the moon,\r\nwith a passage to it, our women would wear nothing but what came\r\ndirectly from thence.[100]\r\n\r\nThe prime cost of wine yearly imported to Ireland is valued at thirty\r\nthousand pounds, and the tea (including coffee and chocolate) at five\r\ntimes that sum. The lace, silks, calicoes, and all other unnecessary\r\nornaments for women, including English cloths and stuffs, added to the\r\nformer articles, make up (to compute grossly), about four hundred\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nNow, if we should allow the thirty thousand pounds for wine, wherein the\r\nwomen have their share, and which is all we have to comfort us, and\r\ndeduct seventy thousand pounds more for over-reckoning, there would\r\nstill remain three hundred thousand pounds, annually spent for\r\nunwholesome drugs, and unnecessary finery. Which prodigious sum would be\r\nwholly saved, and many thousands of our miserable shopkeepers and\r\nmanufacturers comfortably supported.\r\n\r\nLet speculative people busy their brains as much as they please, there\r\nis no other way to prevent this Kingdom from sinking for ever than by\r\nutterly renouncing all foreign dress and luxury.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely so in fact that every husband of any fortune in the\r\nKingdom is nourishing a poisonous, devouring serpent in his bosom with\r\nall the mischief but with none of its wisdom.\r\n\r\nIf all the women were clad with the growth of their own Country, they\r\nmight still vie with each other in the cause of foppery, and still have\r\nroom left to vie with each other, and equally shew their wit and\r\njudgment in deciding upon the variety of Irish stuffs; And if they could\r\nbe contented with their native wholesome slops for breakfast, we should\r\nhear no more of their spleen, hysterics, colics, palpitations, and\r\nasthmas. They might still be allowed to ruin each other and their\r\nhusbands at play, because the money lost would only circulate among\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nMy Lord; I freely own it a wild imagination that any words will cure the\r\nsottishness of men, or the vanity of women, but the Kingdom is in a fair\r\nway of producing the most effectual remedy, when there will not be money\r\nleft for the common course of buying and selling the very necessaries of\r\nlife in our markets, unless we absolutely change the whole method of our\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThis Corporation of Weavers in Woollen and Silks, who have so frequently\r\noffered proposals both to your Grace and to me, are the hottest and\r\ncoldest generation of men that I have known. About a month ago they\r\nattended your Grace, when I had the honour to be with you, and designed\r\nme then the same favour. They desired you would recommend to your clergy\r\nto wear gowns of Irish stuffs, which might probably spread the example\r\namong all their brethren in the Kingdom, and perhaps among the lawyers\r\nand gentlemen of the University and among the citizens of those\r\nCorporations who appear in gowns on solemn occasions. I then mentioned a\r\nkind of stuff, not above eightpence a yard, which I heard had been\r\ncontrived by some of the trade and was very convenient. I desired they\r\nwould prepare some of that or any sort of black stuff on a certain day,\r\nwhen your Grace would appoint as many clergymen as could readily be\r\nfound to meet at your Palace, and there give their opinions; and that\r\nyour Grace's visitations approaching you could then have the best\r\nopportunity of seeing what could be done in a matter of such\r\nconsequence, as they seemed to think, to the woollen manufacture. But\r\ninstead of attending, as was expected, they came to me a fortnight\r\nafter, with a new proposal; that something should be writ by an\r\nacceptable and able hand to promote in general the wearing of home\r\nmanufactures, and their civilities would seem to fix that work upon me.\r\nI asked whether they had prepared the stuffs, as they had promised, and\r\nyour Grace expected; but they had not made the least step in the matter,\r\nnor as it appears thought of it more.\r\n\r\nI did some years ago propose to the masters and principal dealers in the\r\nhome manufactures of silk and wool, that they should meet together, and\r\nafter mature consideration, publish advertisements to the following\r\npurpose.[101] That in order to encourage the wearing of Irish\r\nmanufactures in silk and woollen, they gave notice to the nobility and\r\ngentry of the Kingdom, That they the undersigned would enter into bonds,\r\nfor themselves and for each other, to sell the several sorts of stuffs,\r\ncloths and silks, made to the best perfection they were able, for\r\ncertain fixed prices, and in such a manner, that if a child were sent to\r\nany of their shops, the buyer might be secure of the value and goodness,\r\nand measure of the ware, and lest this might be thought to look like a\r\nmonopoly any other member of the trade might be admitted upon such\r\nconditions as should be agreed on. And if any person whatsoever should\r\ncomplain that he was ill used in the value or goodness of what he\r\nbought, the matter should be examined, the person injured be fully\r\nsatisfied, by the whole corporation without delay, and the dishonest\r\nseller be struck out of the society, unless it appeared evidently that\r\nthe failure proceeded only from mistake.\r\n\r\nThe mortal danger is, that if these dealers could prevail by the\r\ngoodness and cheapness of their cloths and stuffs to give a turn to the\r\nprincipal people of Ireland in favour of their goods, they would relapse\r\ninto the knavish practice peculiar to this Kingdom, which is apt to run\r\nthrough all trades even so low as a common ale-seller, who as soon as he\r\ngets a vogue for his liquor, and outsells his neighbour, thinks his\r\ncredit will put off the worst he can buy; till his customers will come\r\nno more. Thus I have known at London in a general mourning, the drapers\r\ndye black all their old damaged goods, and sell them at double rates,\r\nand then complain and petition the Court, that they are ready to starve\r\nby the continuance of the mourning.\r\n\r\nTherefore I say, those principal weavers who would enter in such a\r\ncompact as I have mentioned, must give sufficient security against all\r\nsuch practices; for if once the women can persuade their husbands that\r\nforeign goods besides the finery will be as cheap, and do more service,\r\nour last state will be worse than the first.\r\n\r\nI do not here pretend to digest perfectly the method by which these\r\nprincipal shopkeepers shall proceed in such a proposal; but my meaning\r\nis clear enough, and cannot reasonably be objected against.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what a destructive loss the Kingdom received by the\r\ndetestable fraud of the merchants, or Northern weavers, or both,\r\nnotwithstanding all the care of the Governers at that Board; the whole\r\ntrade with Spain for our linen, when we had an offer of commerce with\r\nthe Spaniards, to the value as I am told of three hundred thousand\r\npounds a year. But while we deal like pedlars, we shall practise like\r\npedlars; and sacrifice all honesty to the present urging advantage.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said may serve as an answer to the desire made me by the\r\nCorporation of Weavers, that I would offer my notions to the public. As\r\nto anything further, let them apply themselves to the Parliament in\r\ntheir next Session. Let them prevail in the House of Commons to grant\r\none very reasonable request: And I shall think there is still some\r\nspirit left in the Nation, when I read a vote to this purpose:\r\n\"Resolved, _nemine contradicente_, That this House will, for the future,\r\nwear no clothes but such as are made of Irish growth, or of Irish\r\nmanufacture, nor will permit their wives or children to wear any other;\r\nand that they will to the utmost endeavour to prevail with their\r\nfriends, relations, dependants and tenants to follow their example.\" And\r\nif at the same time they could banish tea and coffee, and china-ware,\r\nout of their families, and force their wives to chat their scandal over\r\nan infusion of sage, or other wholesome domestic vegetables, we might\r\npossibly be able to subsist, and pay our absentees, pensioners,\r\ngenerals, civil officers, appeals, colliers, temporary travellers,\r\nstudents, schoolboys, splenetic visitors of Bath, Tunbridge, and Epsom,\r\nwith all other smaller drains, by sending our crude unwrought goods to\r\nEngland, and receiving from thence and all other countries nothing but\r\nwhat is fully manufactured, and keep a few potatoes and oatmeal for our\r\nown subsistence.\r\n\r\nI have been for a dozen years past wisely prognosticating the present\r\ncondition of this Kingdom, which any human creature of common sense\r\ncould foretell with as little sagacity as myself. My meaning is that a\r\nconsumptive body must needs die, which hath spent all its spirits and\r\nreceived no nourishment. Yet I am often tempted to pity when I hear the\r\npoor farmer and cottager lamenting the hardness of the times, and\r\nimputing them either to one or two ill seasons, which better climates\r\nthan ours are more exposed to, or to the scarcity of silver which to a\r\nNation of Liberty would be only a slight and temporary inconveniency, to\r\nbe removed at a month's warning.\r\n\r\nAp., 1729.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS,\r\n\r\nOCCASIONED BY READING A PAPER ENTITLED, \"THE\r\n\r\nCASE OF THE WOOLLEN MANUFACTURES\r\n\r\nOF DUBLIN,\" ETC.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paper called \"The Case of the Woollen Manufactures,\" &c. is very\r\nwell drawn up. The reasonings of the authors are just, the facts true,\r\nand the consequences natural. But his censure of those seven vile\r\ncitizens, who import such a quantity of silk stuffs and woollen cloth\r\nfrom England, is an hundred times gentler than enemies to their country\r\ndeserve; because I think no punishment in this world can be great enough\r\nfor them, without immediate repentance and amendment. But, after all,\r\nthe writer of that paper hath very lightly touched one point of the\r\ngreatest importance, and very poorly answered the main objection, that\r\nthe clothiers are defective both in the quality and quantity of their\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, when I consider the several societies of handicraftsmen\r\nin all kinds, as well as shopkeepers, in this city, after eighteen\r\nyears' experience of their dealings, I am at a loss to know in which of\r\nthese societies the most or least honesty is to be found. For instance,\r\nwhen any trade comes first into my head, upon examination I determine it\r\nexceeds all others in fraud. But after I have considered them all round,\r\nas far as my knowledge or experience reacheth, I am at a loss to\r\ndetermine, and to save trouble I put them all upon a par. This I chiefly\r\napply to those societies of men who get their livelihood by the labour\r\nof their hands. For, as to shopkeepers, I cannot deny that I have found\r\nsome few honest men among them, taking the word honest in the largest\r\nand most charitable sense. But as to handicraftsmen, although I shall\r\nendeavour to believe it possible to find a fair dealer among their\r\nclans, yet I confess it hath never been once my good fortune to employ\r\none single workman, who did not cheat me at all times to the utmost of\r\nhis power in the materials, the work, and the price. One universal maxim\r\nI have constantly observed among them, that they would rather gain a\r\nshilling by cheating you, than twenty in the honest way of dealing,\r\nalthough they were sure to lose your custom, as well as that of others,\r\nwhom you might probably recommend to them.\r\n\r\nThis, I must own, is the natural consequence of poverty and oppression.\r\nThese wretched people catch at any thing to save them a minute longer\r\nfrom drowning. Thus Ireland is the poorest of all civilized countries in\r\nEurope, with every natural advantage to make it one of the richest.\r\n\r\nAs to the grand objection, which this writer slubbers over in so\r\ncareless a manner, because indeed it was impossible to find a\r\nsatisfactory answer, I mean the knavery of our woollen manufacturers in\r\ngeneral, I shall relate some facts, which I had more opportunities to\r\nobserve than usually fall in the way of men who are not of the trade.\r\nFor some years, the masters and wardens, with many of their principal\r\nworkmen and shopkeepers, came often to the Deanery to relate their\r\ngrievances, and to desire my advice as well as my assistance. What\r\nreasons might move them to this proceeding, I leave to public\r\nconjecture. The truth is, that the woollen manufacture of this kingdom\r\nsate always nearest my heart. But the greatest difficulty lay in these\r\nperpetual differences between the shopkeepers and workmen they employed.\r\nTen or a dozen of these latter often came to the Deanery with their\r\ncomplaints, which I often repeated to the shopkeepers. As, that they\r\nbrought their prices too low for a poor weaver to get his bread by; and\r\ninstead of ready money for their labour on Saturdays, they gave them\r\nonly such a quantity of cloth or stuff, at the highest rate, which the\r\npoor men were often forced to sell one-third below the rate, to supply\r\ntheir urgent necessities. On the other side, the shopkeepers complained\r\nof idleness, and want of skill, or care, or honesty, in their workmen;\r\nand probably their accusations on both sides were just.\r\n\r\nWhenever the weavers, in a body, came to me for advice, I gave it\r\nfreely, that they should contrive some way to bring their goods into\r\nreputation; and give up that abominable principle of endeavouring to\r\nthrive by imposing bad ware at high prices to their customers, whereby\r\nno shopkeeper can reasonably expect to thrive. For, besides the dread of\r\nGod's anger, (which is a motive of small force among them,) they may be\r\nsure that no buyer of common sense will return to the same shop where he\r\nwas once or twice defrauded. That gentlemen and ladies, when they found\r\nnothing but deceit in the sale of Irish cloths and stuffs, would act as\r\nthey ought to do, both in prudence and resentment, in going to those\r\nvery bad citizens the writer mentions, and purchase English goods.\r\n\r\nI went farther, and proposed that ten or a dozen of the most substantial\r\nwoollen-drapers should join in publishing an advertisement, signed with\r\ntheir names to the following purpose:--That for the better encouragement\r\nof all gentlemen, &c. the persons undernamed did bind themselves\r\nmutually to sell their several cloths and stuffs, (naming each kind) at\r\nthe lowest rate, right merchantable goods, of such a breadth, which they\r\nwould warrant to be good according to the several prices; and that if a\r\nchild of ten years old were sent with money, and directions what cloth\r\nor stuff to buy, he should not be wronged in any one article. And that\r\nwhoever should think himself ill-used in any of the said shops, he\r\nshould have his money again from the seller, or upon his refusal, from\r\nthe rest of the said subscribers, who, if they found the buyer\r\ndiscontented with the cloth or stuff, should be obliged to refund the\r\nmoney; and if the seller refused to repay them, and take his goods\r\nagain, should publicly advertise that they would answer for none of his\r\ngoods any more. This would be to establish credit, upon which all trade\r\ndependeth.\r\n\r\nI proposed this scheme several times to the corporation of weavers, as\r\nwell as to the manufacturers, when they came to apply for my advice at\r\nthe Deanery-house. I likewise went to the shops of several\r\nwoollen-drapers upon the same errand, but always in vain; for they\r\nperpetually gave me the deaf ear, and avoided entering into discourse\r\nupon that proposal: I suppose, because they thought it was in vain, and\r\nthat the spirit of fraud had gotten too deep and universal a possession\r\nto be driven out by any arguments from interest, reason, or conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nPRESENT MISERABLE STATE\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The following tract was taken by Sir Walter Scott \"from a little\r\n     miscellaneous 12mo volume of pamphlets, communicated by Mr.\r\n     Hartsonge, relating chiefly to Irish affairs, the property at one\r\n     time of Thomas Kingsbury, Esq., son of Dr. Kingsbury, who attended\r\n     Swift in his last illness.\" The present editor came across a\r\n     similar volume while on a visit of research in Dublin, among the\r\n     collection of books which belonged to the late Sir W. Gilbert, and\r\n     which were being catalogued for auction by the bookseller, Mr.\r\n     O'Donoghue. The little 12mo contained this tract which had, as Sir\r\n     W. Scott points out, a portrait of Swift at the end, on the recto\r\n     of the last leaf.\r\n\r\n     According to Sir W. Scott, the friend in Dublin to whom the letter\r\n     is supposed to be addressed, was Sir Robert Walpole. If Scott be\r\n     correct, and there seems little reason to doubt his conjecture, the\r\n     tract must have been written in the second half of the year 1726.\r\n     In the early part of that year Swift had an interview with Walpole.\r\n     Our knowledge of what transpired at that interview is obtained from\r\n     Swift's letter of April 28th, 1726, to Lord Peterborough; from\r\n     Swift's letter to Dr. Stopford of July 20th, 1726; from Pope's\r\n     letter to Swift of September 3rd, 1726; and from Swift's letter to\r\n     Lady Betty Germaine of January 8th, 1732/3. From these letters we\r\n     learn that Swift was really invited by Walpole to meet him. Swift's\r\n     visit to England concerned itself mainly with the publication of\r\n     \"Gulliver's Travels,\" but Sir Henry Craik thinks that Swift had\r\n     other thoughts. \"As regards politics,\" says this biographer, \"he\r\n     was encouraged to hope that without loss either of honour or\r\n     consistency, it was open to him to make terms with the new powers.\r\n     In the end, the result proved that he either over-estimated his own\r\n     capacity of surrendering his independence, or under-estimated the\r\n     terms that would be exacted.\" This remark would leave it open for a\r\n     reader to conclude that Swift would, at a certain price, have been\r\n     ready to join Walpole and his party. But the letters referred to do\r\n     not in the least warrant such a conclusion. Swift's thought was for\r\n     Ireland, and had he been successful with Walpole in his pleading\r\n     for Ireland's cause that minister might have found an ally in\r\n     Swift; but the price to be paid was not to the man. From Swift's\r\n     letter to Peterborough we are at once introduced to Ireland's case,\r\n     and his point of view on this was so opposed to Walpole's\r\n     preconceived notions of how best to govern Ireland, as well as of\r\n     his settled plans, that Swift found, as he put it, that Walpole\r\n     \"had conceived opinions ... which I could not reconcile to the\r\n     notions I had of liberty.\" Not at all of his own liberty, but of\r\n     that of the liberty of a nation; for, as he says (giving now the\r\n     quotation in full): \"I had no other design in desiring to see Sir\r\n     Robert Walpole, than to represent the affairs of Ireland to him in\r\n     a true light, not only without any view to myself, but to any party\r\n     whatsoever ... I failed very much in my design; for I saw that he\r\n     had conceived opinions, _from the example and practices of the\r\n     present, and some former governors_, which I could not reconcile to\r\n     the notions I had of liberty.\" The part given here in italics is\r\n     omitted by Sir H. Craik in his quotation.\r\n\r\n     Swift saw Walpole twice--once at Walpole's invitation at a dinner\r\n     at Chelsea, and a second time at his own wish, expressed through\r\n     Lord Peterborough. At the first meeting nothing of politics could\r\n     be broached, as the encounter was a public one. The second meeting\r\n     was private and resulted in nothing. The letter to Peterborough was\r\n     written by Swift the day after he had seen Walpole, and\r\n     Peterborough was requested to show it to that minister. The letter\r\n     is so pertinent to the subject-matter of this volume that it is\r\n     printed here:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  \"_April 28th, 1726._\r\n            \"SWIFT TO THE EARL OF PETERBOROUGH.\r\n\r\n     \"MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     \"Your lordship having, at my request, obtained for me an hour from\r\n     Sir Robert Walpole, I accordingly attended him yesterday at eight\r\n     o'clock in the morning, and had somewhat more than an hour's\r\n     conversation with him. Your lordship was this day pleased to\r\n     inquire what passed between that great minister and me; to which I\r\n     gave you some general answers, from whence you said you could\r\n     comprehend little or nothing.\r\n\r\n     \"I had no other design in desiring to see Sir Robert Walpole, than\r\n     to represent the affairs of Ireland to him in a true light, not\r\n     only without any view to myself, but to any party whatsoever: and,\r\n     because I understood the affairs of that kingdom tolerably well,\r\n     and observed the representations he had received were such as I\r\n     could not agree to; my principal design was to set him right, not\r\n     only for the service of Ireland, but likewise of England, and of\r\n     his own administration.\r\n\r\n     \"I failed very much in my design; for I saw he had conceived\r\n     opinions, from the example and practices of the present, and some\r\n     former governors, which I could not reconcile to the notions I had\r\n     of liberty, a possession always understood by the British nation to\r\n     be the inheritance of a human creature.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Robert Walpole was pleased to enlarge very much upon the\r\n     subject of Ireland, in a manner so alien from what I conceived to\r\n     be the rights and privileges of a subject of England, that I did\r\n     not think proper to debate the matter with him so much as I\r\n     otherwise might, because I found it would be in vain. I shall,\r\n     therefore, without entering into dispute, make bold to mention to\r\n     your lordship some few grievances of that kingdom, as it consists\r\n     of a people who, beside a natural right of enjoying the privileges\r\n     of subjects, have also a claim of merit from their extraordinary\r\n     loyalty to the present king and his family.\r\n\r\n     \"First, That all persons born in Ireland are called and treated as\r\n     Irishmen, although their fathers and grandfathers were born in\r\n     England; and their predecessors having been conquerors of Ireland,\r\n     it is humbly considered they ought to be on as good a foot as any\r\n     subjects of Britain, according to the practice of all other\r\n     nations, and particularly of the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n     \"Secondly, That they are denied the natural liberty of exporting\r\n     their manufactures to any country which is not engaged in a war\r\n     with England.\r\n\r\n     \"Thirdly, That whereas there is a university in Ireland, founded by\r\n     Queen Elizabeth, where youth are instructed with a much stricter\r\n     discipline than either in Oxford or Cambridge, it lies under the\r\n     greatest discouragements, by filling all the principal employments,\r\n     civil and ecclesiastical, with persons from England, who have\r\n     neither interest, property, acquaintance, nor alliance, in that\r\n     kingdom; contrary to the practice of all other states in Europe\r\n     which are governed by viceroys, at least what hath never been used\r\n     without the utmost discontents of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"Fourthly, That several of the bishops sent over to Ireland, having\r\n     been clergymen of obscure condition, and without other distinction\r\n     than that of chaplains to the governors, do frequently invite over\r\n     their old acquaintances or kindred, to whom they bestow the best\r\n     preferment in their gift. The like may be said of the judges, who\r\n     take with them one or two dependants, to whom they give their\r\n     countenance; and who, consequently, without other merit, grow\r\n     immediately into the chief business of their courts. The same\r\n     practice is followed by all others in civil employments, if they\r\n     have a cousin, a valet, or footman in their family, born in\r\n     England.\r\n\r\n     \"Fifthly, That all civil employments, granted in reversion, are\r\n     given to persons who reside in England.\r\n\r\n     \"The people of Ireland, who are certainly the most loyal subjects\r\n     in the world, cannot but conceive that most of these hardships have\r\n     been the consequence of some unfortunate representations (at least)\r\n     in former times; and the whole body of the gentry feel the effects\r\n     in a very sensible part, being utterly destitute of all means to\r\n     make provision for their younger sons, either in the Church, the\r\n     law, the revenue, or (of late) in the army; and, in the desperate\r\n     condition of trade, it is equally vain to think of making them\r\n     merchants. All they have left is, at the expiration of leases, to\r\n     rack their tenants, which they have done to such a degree, that\r\n     there is not one farmer in a hundred through the kingdom who can\r\n     afford shoes or stockings to his children, or to eat flesh, or\r\n     drink anything better than sour milk or water, twice in a year; so\r\n     that the whole country, except the Scottish plantation in the\r\n     north, is a scene of misery and desolation hardly to be matched on\r\n     this side of Lapland.\r\n\r\n     \"The rents of Ireland are computed to about a million and a half,\r\n     whereof one half million at least is spent by lords and gentlemen\r\n     residing in England, and by some other articles too long to\r\n     mention.\r\n\r\n     \"About three hundred thousand pounds more are returned thither on\r\n     other accounts; and, upon the whole, those who are the best versed\r\n     in that kind of knowledge agree, that England gains annually by\r\n     Ireland a million at least, which even I could make appear beyond\r\n     all doubt.\r\n\r\n     \"But, as this mighty profit would probably increase, with tolerable\r\n     treatment, to half a million more, so it must of necessity sink,\r\n     under the hardships that kingdom lies at present.\r\n\r\n     \"And whereas Sir Robert Walpole was pleased to take notice, how\r\n     little the king gets by Ireland, it ought, perhaps to be\r\n     considered, that the revenues and taxes, I think, amount to above\r\n     four hundred thousand pounds a-year; and, reckoning the riches of\r\n     Ireland, compared with England, to be as one to twelve, the king's\r\n     revenues there would be equal to more than five millions here;\r\n     which, considering the bad payment of rents, from such miserable\r\n     creatures as most of the tenants in Ireland are, will be allowed to\r\n     be as much as such a kingdom can bear.\r\n\r\n     \"The current coin of Ireland is reckoned, at most, but at five\r\n     hundred thousand pounds; so that above four-fifths are paid every\r\n     year into the exchequer.\r\n\r\n     \"I think it manifest, that whatever circumstances could possibly\r\n     contribute to make a country poor and despicable, are all united\r\n     with respect to Ireland. The nation controlled by laws to which\r\n     they do not consent, disowned by their brethren and countrymen,\r\n     refused the liberty not only of trading with their own\r\n     manufactures, but even their native commodities, forced to seek for\r\n     justice many hundred miles by sea and land, rendered in a manner\r\n     incapable of serving their king and country in any employment of\r\n     honour, trust, or profit; and all this without the least demerit;\r\n     while the governors sent over thither can possibly have no\r\n     affection to the people, further than what is instilled into them\r\n     by their own justice and love of mankind, which do not always\r\n     operate; and whatever they please to represent hither is never\r\n     called in question.\r\n\r\n     \"Whether the representatives of such a people, thus distressed and\r\n     laid in the dust, when they meet in a parliament, can do the public\r\n     business with that cheerfulness which might be expected from\r\n     free-born subjects, would be a question in any other country except\r\n     that unfortunate island; the English inhabitants whereof have given\r\n     more and greater examples of their loyalty and dutifulness, than\r\n     can be shown in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"What part of these grievances may be thought proper to be\r\n     redressed by so wise and great a minister as Sir Robert Walpole, he\r\n     perhaps will please to consider; especially because they have been\r\n     all brought upon that kingdom since the Revolution; which, however,\r\n     is a blessing annually celebrated there with the greatest zeal and\r\n     sincerity.\r\n\r\n     \"I most humbly entreat your lordship to give this paper to Sir\r\n     Robert Walpole, and desire him to read it, which he may do in a few\r\n     minutes.

I have always lived as\r\nretired as possible; I have carefully avoided the perplexed honour of\r\ncity-offices; I have never minded anybody's business but my own; upon\r\nall which accounts, and several others, you might easily have found\r\namong my fellow-citizens, persons more capable to resolve the weighty\r\nquestions you put to me, than I can pretend to be.\r\n\r\nBut being entirely at leisure, even at this season of the year, when I\r\nused to have scarce time sufficient to perform the necessary offices of\r\nlife, I will endeavour to comply with your requests, cautioning you not\r\nimplicitly to rely upon what I say, excepting what belongs to that\r\nbranch of trade in which I am more immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Irish trade is, at present, in the most deplorable condition that\r\ncan be imagined; to remedy it, the causes of its languishment must be\r\ninquired into: But as those causes (you may assure yourself) will not be\r\nremoved, you may look upon it as a thing past hopes of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest shock our trade received, was from an act passed\r\nin the reign of King William, in the Parliament of England, prohibiting\r\nthe exportation of wool manufactured in Ireland. An act (as the event\r\nplainly shews) fuller of greediness than good policy; an act as\r\nbeneficial to France and Spain, as it has been destructive to England\r\nand Ireland.[103] At the passing of this fatal act, the condition of\r\nour trade was glorious and flourishing, though no way interfering with\r\nthe English; we made no broad-cloths above _6s._ per yard; coarse\r\ndruggets, bays and shalloons, worsted damasks, strong draught works,\r\nslight half-works, and gaudy stuffs, were the only product of our looms:\r\nthese were partly consumed by the meanest of our people, and partly\r\nsent to the northern nations, from which we had in exchange, timber,\r\niron, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, and hard dollars. At the time the current\r\nmoney of Ireland was foreign silver, a man could hardly receive _100l._,\r\nwithout finding the coin of all the northern powers, and every prince of\r\nthe empire among it. This money was returned into England for fine\r\ncloths, silks, &c. for our own wear, for rents, for coals, for hardware,\r\nand all other English manufactures, and, in a great measure, supplied\r\nthe London merchants with foreign silver for exportation.\r\n\r\nThe repeated clamours of the English weavers produced this act, so\r\ndestructive to themselves and us. They looked with envious eyes upon our\r\nprosperity, and complained of being undersold by us in those\r\ncommodities, which they themselves did not deal in. At their instances\r\nthe act was passed, and we lost our profitable northern trade. Have they\r\ngot it? No, surely, you have found they have ever since declined in the\r\ntrade they so happily possessed; you shall find (if I am rightly\r\ninformed) towns without one loom in them, which subsisted entirely upon\r\nthe woollen manufactory before the passing of this unhappy bill; and I\r\nwill try if I can give the true reasons for the decay of their trade,\r\nand our calamities.\r\n\r\nThree parts in four of the inhabitants of that district of the town\r\nwhere I dwell were English manufacturers, whom either misfortunes in\r\ntrade, little petty debts, contracted through idleness, or the pressures\r\nof a numerous family, had driven into our cheap country: These were\r\nemployed in working up our coarse wool, while the finest was sent into\r\nEngland. Several of these had taken the children of the native Irish\r\napprentices to them, who being humbled by the forfeiture of upward of\r\nthree millions by the Revolution, were obliged to stoop to a mechanic\r\nindustry. Upon the passing of this bill, we were obliged to dismiss\r\nthousands of these people from our service. Those who had settled their\r\naffairs returned home, and overstocked England with workmen; those whose\r\ndebts were unsatisfied went to France, Spain, and the Netherlands, where\r\nthey met with good encouragement, whereby the natives, having got a firm\r\nfooting in the trade, being acute fellows, soon became as good workmen\r\nas any we have, and supply the foreign manufactories with a constant\r\nrecruit of artisans; our island lying much more under pasture than any\r\nin Europe. The foreigners (notwithstanding all the restrictions the\r\nEnglish Parliament has bound us up with) are furnished with the greatest\r\nquantity of our choicest wool. I need not tell you, sir, that a\r\ncustom-house oath is held as little sacred here as in England, or that\r\nit is common for masters of vessels to swear themselves bound for one of\r\nthe English wool ports, and unload in France or Spain. By this means the\r\ntrade in those parts is, in a great measure, destroyed, and we were\r\nobliged to try our hands at finer works, having only our home\r\nconsumption to depend upon; and, I can assure you, we have, in several\r\nkinds of narrow goods, even exceeded the English, and I believe we\r\nshall, in a few years more, be able to equal them in broad cloths; but\r\nthis you may depend upon, that scarce the tenth part of English goods\r\nare now imported, of what used to be before the famous act.\r\n\r\nThe only manufactured wares we are allowed to export, are linen cloth\r\nand linen yarn, which are marketable only in England; the rest of our\r\ncommodities are wool, restrained to England, and raw hides, skins,\r\ntallow, beef, and butter. Now, these are things for which the northern\r\nnations have no occasion; we are therefore obliged, instead of carrying\r\nwoollen goods to their markets, and bringing home money, to purchase\r\ntheir commodities.\r\n\r\nIn France, Spain, and Portugal, our wares are more valuable, though it\r\nmust be owned, our fraudulent trade in wool is the best branch of our\r\ncommerce; from hence we get wines, brandy, and fruit, very cheap, and\r\nin great perfection; so that though England has constrained us to be\r\npoor, they have given us leave to be merry. From these countries we\r\nbring home moydores, pistoles, and louisdores, without which we should\r\nscarce have a penny to turn upon.\r\n\r\nTo England we are allowed to send nothing but linen cloth, yarn, raw\r\nhides, skins, tallow, and wool. From thence we have coals, for which we\r\nalways pay ready money, India goods, English woollen and silks, tobacco,\r\nhardware, earthenware, salt, and several other commodities. Our\r\nexportations to England are very much overbalanced by our importations;\r\nso that the course of exchange is generally too high, and people choose\r\nrather to make their remittances to England in specie, than by a bill,\r\nand our nation is perpetually drained of its little running cash.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the decay of trade, scarcity of money, and swelling of\r\nexchange, is the unnatural affectation of our gentry to reside in and\r\nabout London.[104] Their rents are remitted to them, and spent there.\r\nThe countryman wants employment from them; the country shopkeeper wants\r\ntheir custom. For this reason he can't pay his Dublin correspondent\r\nreadily, nor take off a great quantity of his wares. Therefore, the\r\nDublin merchant can't employ the artisan, nor keep up his credit in\r\nforeign markets.\r\n\r\nI have discoursed some of these gentlemen, persons esteemed for good\r\nsense, and demanded a reason for this their so unaccountable\r\nproceeding,--expensive to them for the present, ruinous to their\r\ncountry, and destructive to the future value of their estates,--and find\r\nall their answers summed up under three heads, curiosity, pleasure, and\r\nloyalty to King George. The two first excuses deserve no answer; let us\r\ntry the validity of the third. Would not loyalty be much better\r\nexpressed by gentlemen staying in their respective countries,\r\ninfluencing their dependents by their examples, saving their own wealth,\r\nand letting their neighbours profit by their necessary expenses, thereby\r\nkeeping them from misery, and its unavoidable consequence, discontent?\r\nOr is it better to flock to London, be lost in a crowd, kiss the King's\r\nhand, and take a view of the royal family? The seeing of the royal house\r\nmay animate their zeal for it; but other advantages I know not. What\r\nemployment have any of our gentlemen got by their attendance at Court,\r\nto make up to them their expenses? Why, about forty of them have been\r\ncreated peers, and a little less than a hundred of them baronets and\r\nknights. For these excellent advantages, thousands of our gentry have\r\nsqueezed their tenants, impoverished the trader, and impaired their own\r\nfortunes!\r\n\r\nAnother great calamity, is the exorbitant raising of the rents of lands.\r\nUpon the determination of all leases made before the year 1690, a\r\ngentleman thinks he has but indifferently improved his estate if he has\r\nonly doubled his rent-roll. Farms are screwed up to a rack-rent, leases\r\ngranted but for a small term of years, tenants tied down to hard\r\nconditions, and discouraged from cultivating the lands they occupy to\r\nthe best advantage, by the certainty they have of the rent being raised,\r\non the expiration of their lease, proportionably to the improvements\r\nthey shall make. Thus is honest industry restrained; the farmer is a\r\nslave to his landlord; 'tis well if he can cover his family with a\r\ncoarse home-spun frieze. The artisan has little dealings with him; yet\r\nhe is obliged to take his provisions from him at an extravagant price,\r\notherwise the farmer cannot pay his rent.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of lands keep great part of them in their own hands for\r\nsheep-pasture; and there are thousands of poor wretches who think\r\nthemselves blessed, if they can obtain a hut worse than the squire's\r\ndog-kennel, and an acre of ground for a potato-plantation, on condition\r\nof being as very slaves as any in America. What can be more deplorable,\r\nthan to behold wretches starving in the midst of plenty!\r\n\r\nWe are apt to charge the Irish with laziness, because we seldom find\r\nthem employed; but then we don't consider they have nothing to do. Sir\r\nWilliam Temple, in his excellent remarks on the United Provinces,\r\ninquires why Holland, which has the fewest and worst ports and\r\ncommodities of any nation in Europe, should abound in trade, and\r\nIreland, which has the most and best of both, should have none? This\r\ngreat man attributes this surprising accident to the natural aversion\r\nman has for labour; who will not be persuaded to toil and fatigue\r\nhimself for the superfluities of life throughout the week, when he may\r\nprovide himself with all necessary subsistence by the labour of a day or\r\ntwo. But, with due submission to Sir William's profound judgment, the\r\nwant of trade with us is rather owing to the cruel restraints we lie\r\nunder, than to any disqualification whatsoever in our inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI have not, sir, for these thirty years past, since I was concerned in\r\ntrade, (the greatest part of which time distresses have been flowing in\r\nupon us,) ever observed them to swell so suddenly to such a height as\r\nthey have done within these few months. Our present calamities are not\r\nto be represented; you can have no notion of them without beholding\r\nthem. Numbers of miserable objects crowd our doors, begging us to take\r\ntheir wares at any price, to prevent their families from immediate\r\nstarving. We cannot part with our money to them, both because we know\r\nnot when we shall have vent for their goods; and, as there are no debts\r\npaid, we are afraid of reducing ourselves to their lamentable\r\ncircumstances. The dismal time of trade we had during Marr's Troubles in\r\nScotland, are looked upon as happy days when compared with the\r\npresent.[105]\r\n\r\nI need not tell you, sir, that this griping want, this dismal poverty,\r\nthis additional woe, must be put to the accursed stocks, which have\r\ndesolated our country more effectually than England. Stockjobbing was a\r\nkind of traffic we were utterly unacquainted with. We went late to the\r\nSouth Sea market, and bore a great share in the losses of it, without\r\nhaving tasted any of its profits.\r\n\r\nIf many in England have been ruined by stocks, some have been advanced.\r\nThe English have a free and open trade to repair their losses; but,\r\nabove all, a wise, vigilant, and uncorrupted Parliament and ministry,\r\nstrenuously endeavouring to restore public trade to its former happy\r\nstate. Whilst we, having lost the greatest part of our cash, without any\r\nprobability of its returning, must despair of retrieving our losses by\r\ntrade, and have before our eyes the dismal prospect of universal poverty\r\nand desolation.\r\n\r\nI believe, sir, you are by this time heartily tired with this indigested\r\nletter, and are firmly persuaded of the truth of what I said in the\r\nbeginning of it, that you had much better have imposed this task on some\r\nof our citizens of greater abilities. But perhaps, sir, such a letter as\r\nthis may be, for the singularity of it, entertaining to you, who\r\ncorrespond with the politest and most learned men in Europe. But I am\r\nsatisfied you will excuse its want of exactness and perspicuity, when\r\nyou consider my education, my being unaccustomed to writings of this\r\nnature, and, above all, those calamitous objects which constantly\r\nsurround us, sufficient to disturb the cleanest imagination, and the\r\nsoundest judgment.\r\n\r\nWhatever cause I have given you, by this letter, to think worse of my\r\nsense and judgment, I fancy I have given you a manifest proof that I am,\r\nsir,\r\n\r\n                               Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                              J. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nOF WHAT WAS SAID BY\r\n\r\nTHE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK'S\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nTHE LORD MAYOR AND SOME OF THE ALDERMEN,\r\n\r\nWHEN HIS LORDSHIP CAME TO PRESENT THE SAID\r\n\r\nDEAN WITH HIS FREEDOM IN A GOLD BOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was only proper and fitting that the citizens and freemen of the\r\n     City of Dublin should express their sense of the high appreciation\r\n     in which they held the writer of the \"Drapier's Letters,\" and the\r\n     man who had fought and was still fighting for an alleviation of the\r\n     grievances under which their country suffered. The Dublin\r\n     Corporation, in 1729, presented Swift with the freedom of the city,\r\n     an honour rarely bestowed, and only on men in high position and\r\n     power. To Swift the honour was welcome. It was a public act of\r\n     justification of what he had done, and it came gratefully to the\r\n     man who had at one time been abused and reviled by the people of\r\n     the very city which was now honouring him. Furthermore, such a\r\n     confirmation of his acts set the seal of public authority which was\r\n     desirable, even if not necessary, to a man of Swift's temper. He\r\n     could save himself much trouble by merely pointing to the gold box\r\n     which was presented to him with the freedom. Even in this last\r\n     moment, however, of public recognition, he was not allowed to\r\n     receive it without a snarl from one of the crowd of the many\r\n     slanderers who found it safer to backbite him. Lord Allen may have\r\n     been wrong in his head, or ill-advised, or foolishly over-zealous,\r\n     but his ill-tempered upbraiding of the Dublin Corporation for what\r\n     he called their treasonable extravagance in thus honouring Swift,\r\n     whom he deemed an enemy of the King, was the act of a fool. Swift\r\n     was not the man to let the occasion slip by without advantage. In\r\n     the substance of what he said to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of\r\n     Dublin in accepting their gift, he replied to the charges made by\r\n     Lord Allen, and also issued a special advertisement by way of\r\n     defence against what the lord had thought fit to say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Both these pieces are here reprinted; the first from a broadside in\r\n     the British Museum, and the second from a manuscript copy in the\r\n     Forster Collection at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WAS SAID BY THE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK'S\r\n\r\nTO THE LORD MAYOR AND SOME OF THE ALDERMEN, WHEN HIS\r\nLORDSHIP CAME TO PRESENT THE SAID DEAN WITH HIS FREEDOM\r\nIN A GOLD BOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen his Lordship had said a few words, and presented the instrument,\r\nthe Dean gently put it back, and desired first to be heard. He said, \"He\r\nwas much obliged to his lordship and the city for the honour they were\r\ngoing to do him, and which, as he was informed, they had long intended\r\nhim. That it was true, this honour was mingled with a little\r\nmortification by the delay which attended it, but which, however, he did\r\nnot impute to his lordship or the city; and that the mortification was\r\nthe less, because he would willingly hope the delay was founded on a\r\nmistake;--for which opinion he would tell his reason.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"It was well known, that, some time ago, a person with a\r\ntitle[106] was pleased, in two great assemblies, to rattle bitterly\r\nsomebody without a name, under the injurious appellations of a Tory, a\r\nJacobite, an enemy to King George, and a libeller of the government;\r\nwhich character,\" the Dean said that, \"many people thought was applied\r\nto him. But he was unwilling to be of that opinion, because the person\r\nwho had delivered those abusive words, had, for several years, caressed,\r\nand courted, and solicited his friendship more than any man in either\r\nkingdom had ever done,--by inviting him to his house in town and\r\ncountry,--by coming to the Deanery often, and calling or sending almost\r\nevery day when the Dean was sick,--with many other particulars of the\r\nsame nature, which continued even to a day or two of the time when the\r\nsaid person made those invectives in the council and House of Lords.\r\nTherefore, that the Dean would by no means think those scurrilous words\r\ncould be intended against him; because such a proceeding would overthrow\r\nall the principles of honour, justice, religion, truth, and even common\r\nhumanity. Therefore the Dean will endeavour to believe, that the said\r\nperson had some other object in his thoughts, and it was only the\r\nuncharitable custom of the world that applied this character to him.\r\nHowever, that he would insist on this argument no longer. But one thing\r\nhe would affirm and declare, without assigning any name, or making any\r\nexception, that whoever either did, or does, or shall hereafter, at any\r\ntime, charge him with the character of a Jacobite, an enemy to King\r\nGeorge, or a libeller of the government, the said accusation was, is,\r\nand will be, false, malicious, slanderous, and altogether groundless.\r\nAnd he would take the freedom to tell his lordship, and the rest that\r\nstood by, that he had done more service to the Hanover title, and more\r\ndisservice to the Pretender's cause, than forty thousand of those noisy,\r\nrailing, malicious, empty zealots, to whom nature hath denied any talent\r\nthat could be of use to God or their country, and left them only the\r\ngift of reviling, and spitting their venom, against all who differ from\r\nthem in their destructive principles, both in church and state. That he\r\nconfessed, it was sometimes his misfortune to dislike some things in\r\npublic proceedings in both kingdoms, wherein he had often the honour to\r\nagree with wise and good men; but this did by no means affect either his\r\nloyalty to his prince, or love to his country. But, on the contrary, he\r\nprotested, that such dislikes never arose in him from any other\r\nprinciples than the duty he owed to the king, and his affection to the\r\nkingdom. That he had been acquainted with courts and ministers long\r\nenough, and knew too well that the best ministers might mistake in\r\npoints of great importance; and that he had the honour to know many more\r\nable, and at least full as honest, as any can be at present.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dean further said, \"That since he had been so falsely represented,\r\nhe thought it became him to give some account of himself for about\r\ntwenty years, if it were only to justify his lordship and the city for\r\nthe honour they were going to do him.\" He related briefly, how, \"merely\r\nby his own personal credit, without other assistance, and in two\r\njourneys at his own expense, he had procured a grant of the first-fruits\r\nto the clergy, in the late Queen's time, for which he thought he\r\ndeserved some gentle treatment from his brethren.[107] That, during all\r\nthe administration of the said ministry, he had been a constant advocate\r\nfor those who are called the Whigs,--and kept many of them in their\r\nemployments both in England and here,--and some who were afterwards the\r\nfirst to lift up their heels against him.\" He reflected a little upon\r\nthe severe treatment he had met with upon his return to Ireland after\r\nher Majesty's death, and for some years after. \"That being forced to\r\nlive retired, he could think of no better way to do public service, than\r\nby employing all the little money he could save, and lending it, without\r\ninterest, in small sums to poor industrious tradesmen, without examining\r\ntheir party or their faith. And God had so far pleased to bless his\r\nendeavours, that his managers tell him he hath recovered above two\r\nhundred families in this city from ruin, and placed most of them in a\r\ncomfortable way of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dean related, how much he had suffered in his purse, and with what\r\nhazard to his liberty, by a most iniquitous judge[108]; who, to gratify\r\nhis ambition and rage of party, had condemned an innocent book, written\r\nwith no worse a design, than to persuade the people of this kingdom to\r\nwear their own manufactures.[109] How the said judge had endeavoured to\r\nget a jury to his mind; but they proved so honest, that he was forced to\r\nkeep them eleven hours, and send them back nine times; until, at last,\r\nthey were compelled to leave the printer[110] to the mercy of the court,\r\nand the Dean was forced to procure a _noli prosequi_ from a noble\r\nperson, then secretary of state, who had been his old friend.\r\n\r\nThe Dean then freely confessed himself to be the author of those books\r\ncalled \"The Drapier's Letters;\" spoke gently of the proclamation,\r\noffering three hundred pounds to discover the writer.[111] He said,\r\n\"That although a certain person was pleased to mention those books in a\r\nslight manner at a public assembly, yet he (the Dean) had learned to\r\nbelieve, that there were ten thousand to one in the kingdom who differed\r\nfrom that person; and the people of England, who had ever heard of the\r\nmatter, as well as in France, were all of the same opinion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dean mentioned several other particulars, some of which those from\r\nwhom I had the account could not recollect; and others, although of\r\ngreat consequence, perhaps his enemies would not allow him.\r\n\r\nThe Dean concluded, with acknowledging to have expressed his wishes,\r\nthat an inscription might have been graven on the box, shewing some\r\nreason why the city thought fit to do him that honour, which was much\r\nout of the common forms to a person in a private station;--those\r\ndistinctions being usually made only to chief governors, or persons in\r\nvery high employments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT BY DR.

M'Culla's project was to\r\n     put in circulation notes stamped on copper to supply the deficiency\r\n     in copper coins which Wood attempted. Swift, apparently, took a\r\n     mild tone towards M'Culla's plan, but thought that M'Culla would\r\n     make too much out of it for himself. He made a counter proposal\r\n     which is fully entered into here.

I have some knowledge of the man; and about a month\r\nago he brought me his book, with a couple of his halfpenny notes: but I\r\nwas then out of order, and he could not be admitted. Since that time I\r\ncalled at his house; where I discoursed, the whole affair with him as\r\nthoroughly as I could. I am altogether a stranger to his character. He\r\ntalked to me in the usual style, with a great profession of zeal for the\r\npublic good, which is the common cant of all projectors in their Bills,\r\nfrom a First Minister of State down to a corn-cutter. But I stopped him\r\nshort, as I would have done a better man; because it is too gross a\r\npretence to pass at any time, and especially in this age, where we all\r\nknow one another so well. Yet, whoever proposeth any scheme which may\r\nprove to be a public benefit, I shall not quarrel if it prove likewise\r\nvery beneficial to the contriver. It is certain, that next to the want\r\nof silver, our greatest distress in point of coin is the want of small\r\nchange, which may be some poor relief for the defect of the former,\r\nsince the Crown will not please to take that work upon them here as they\r\ndo in England. One thing in Mr. M'Culla's book is certainly right, that\r\nno law hinders me from giving a payable note upon leather, wood, copper,\r\nbrass, iron, or any other material (except gold and silver) as well as\r\nupon paper. The question is, whether I can sue him on a copper bond,\r\nwhen there is neither his hand nor seal, nor witnesses to prove it? To\r\nsupply this, he hath proposed, that the materials upon which his note is\r\nwritten, shall be in some degree of value equal to the debt. But that is\r\none principal matter to be enquired into. His scheme is this:\r\n\r\nHe gives you a piece of copper for a halfpenny or penny, stamped with a\r\npromissory note to pay you twentypence for every pound of the said\r\ncopper notes, whenever you shall return them. Eight and forty of the\r\nhalfpenny pieces are to weigh a pound, and he sells you that pound\r\ncoined and stamped for two shillings: by which he clearly gains a little\r\nmore than sixteen _per cent._; that is to say, twopence in every\r\nshilling. This will certainly arise to a great sum, if he should\r\ncirculate as large a quantity of his notes, as the kingdom, under the\r\ngreat dearth of silver, may very probably require: enough indeed to make\r\nany Irish tradesman's fortune; which, however, I should not repine at in\r\nthe least, if we could be sure of his fair-dealing.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious for me to raise the common objection, why Mr. M'Culla\r\nwould not give security to pay the whole sum to any man who returned him\r\nhis copper notes, as my Lord Dartmouth and Colonel Moor were, by their\r\npatents, obliged to do.[113] To which he gave some answers plausible\r\nenough. First, \"He conceived that his coins were much nearer to the\r\nintrinsic value than any of those coined by patents, the bulk and\r\ngoodness of the metal fully equalling the best English halfpence made by\r\nthe crown: That he apprehended the ill-will of envious and designing\r\npeople, who, if they found him to have a great vent for his notes, since\r\nhe wanted the protection of a patent, might make a run upon him, which\r\nhe could not be able to support: And lastly, that his copper, (as is\r\nalready said,) being equal in value and bulk to the English halfpence,\r\nhe did not apprehend they should ever be returned, unless a combination,\r\nproceeding from spite and envy, might be formed against him.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are some points in his proposals which I cannot well answer\r\nfor; nor do I know whether he would be able to do it himself. The first\r\nis, whether the copper he gives us will be as good as what the crown\r\nprovided for the English halfpence and farthings; and, secondly, whether\r\nhe will always continue to give us as good; and, thirdly, when he will\r\nthink fit to stop his hand, and give us no more; for I should be as\r\nsorry to lie at the mercy of Mr. M'Culla, as of Mr. Wood.\r\n\r\nThere is another difficulty of the last importance. It is known enough\r\nthat the Crown is supposed to be neither gainer nor loser by the coinage\r\nof any metal; for they subtract, or ought to subtract, no more from the\r\nintrinsic value than what will just pay all the charges of the mint; and\r\nhow much that will amount to, is the question. By what I could gather\r\nfrom Mr. M'Culla, good copper is worth fourteenpence per pound. By this\r\ncomputation, if he sells his copper notes for two shillings the pound,\r\nand will pay twentypence back, then the expense of coinage for one pound\r\nof copper must be sixpence, which is thirty per cent. The world should\r\nbe particularly satisfied on this article before he vends his notes; for\r\nthe discount of thirty per cent. is prodigious, and vastly more than I\r\ncan conceive it ought to be. For, if we add to that proportion the\r\nsixteen per cent. which he avows to keep for his own profit, there will\r\nbe a discount of about forty-six per cent. Or, to reckon, I think, a\r\nfairer way: Whoever buys a pound of Mr. M'Culla's coin, at two shillings\r\nper pound, carries home only the real value of fourteenpence, which is a\r\npound of copper; and thus he is a loser of _41l. 13s. 4d._ per\r\ncent.[114] But, however, this high discount of thirty per cent. will be\r\nno objection against M'Culla's proposals; because, if the charge of\r\ncoinage will honestly amount to so much, and we suppose his copper notes\r\nmay be returned upon him, he will be the greater sufferer of the two;\r\nbecause the buyer can lose but fourpence in the pound, and M'Culla must\r\nlose sixpence, which was the charge of the coinage.[115]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, there are some points which must be settled to the\r\ngeneral satisfaction, before we can safely take Mr. M'Culla's copper\r\nnotes for value received; and how he will give that satisfaction, is not\r\nwithin my knowledge or conjecture. The first point is, that we shall be\r\nalways sure of receiving good copper, equal in bulk and fineness to the\r\nbest English halfpence.\r\n\r\nThe second point is, to know what allowance he makes to himself, either\r\nout of the weight or mixture of his copper, or both, for the charge of\r\nhis coinage. As to the weight, the matter is easy by his own scheme;\r\nfor, as I have said before, he proposes forty-eight to weigh a pound,\r\nwhich he gives you for two shillings, and receives it by the pound at\r\ntwentypence: so that, supposing pure copper to be fourteenpence a pound,\r\nhe makes you pay thirty per cent. for the labour of coining, as I have\r\nalready observed, besides sixteen per cent. when he sells it. But if to\r\nthis he adds any alloy, to debase the metal, although it be not above\r\nten per cent.; then Mr. M'Culla's promissory notes will, as to the\r\nintrinsic value of the metal, be above forty-seven per cent. discount.\r\n\r\nFor, subtracting ten per cent. off sixty pound's worth of copper, it\r\nwill (to avoid fractions) be about five and a half per cent. in the\r\nwhole _100l._, which, added to\r\n\r\n                      41 13 4\r\n                       5 10 0\r\n                      -------\r\n  will be per cent.   47  3 4\r\n\r\nThat we are under great distress for change, and that Mr. M'Culla's\r\ncopper notes, on supposition of the metal being pure, is less liable to\r\nobjection than the project of Wood, may be granted: but such a discount,\r\nwhere we are not sure even of our twentypence a pound, appears hitherto\r\na dead weight on his scheme.\r\n\r\nSince I writ this, calling to mind that I had some copper halfpence by\r\nme, I weighed them with those of Mr. M'Culla, and observed as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, I weighed Mr. M'Culla's halfpenny against an English one of King\r\nCharles II., which outweighed Mr. M'Culla's a fourth part, or\r\ntwenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nI likewise weighed an Irish Patrick and David halfpenny, which\r\noutweighed Mr. M'Culla's twelve and a half per cent. It had a very fair\r\nand deep impression, and milled very skilfully round.\r\n\r\nI found that even a common halfpenny, well-preserved, weighed equal to\r\nMr. M'Culla's. And even some of Wood's halfpence were near equal in\r\nweight to his. Therefore, if it be true that he does not think Wood's\r\ncopper to have been faulty, he may probably give us no better.\r\n\r\nI have laid these loose thoughts together with little order, to give\r\nyou, and others who may read them, an opportunity of digesting them\r\nbetter. I am no enemy to Mr. M'Culla's project; but I would have it put\r\nupon a better foot. I own that this halfpenny of King Charles II., which\r\nI weighed against Mr. M'Culla's, was of the fairest kind I had seen.\r\nHowever, it is plain the Crown could afford it without being a\r\nloser.[116] But it is probable that the officers of the mint were then\r\nmore honest than they have since thought fit to be; for I confess not to\r\nhave met those of any other year so weighty, or in appearance of so good\r\nmetal, among all the copper coins of the three last reigns; yet these,\r\nhowever, did much outweigh those of Mr. M'Culla; for I have tried the\r\nexperiment on a hundred of them. I have indeed seen accidentally one or\r\ntwo very light; but it must certainly have been done by chance, or\r\nrather I suppose them to be counterfeits. Be that as it will, it is\r\nallowed on all hands, that good copper was never known to be cheaper\r\nthan it is at present. I am ignorant of the price, further than by his\r\ninforming me that it is only fourteenpence a pound; by which, I observe,\r\nhe charges the coinage at thirty per cent.; and therefore I cannot but\r\nthink his demands are exorbitant. But, to say the truth, the dearness or\r\ncheapness of the metal do not properly enter into the question. What we\r\ndesire is, that it should be of the best kind, and as weighty as can be\r\nafforded; that the profit of the contriver should be reduced from\r\nsixteen to eight per cent.; and the charge of coinage, if possible, from\r\nthirty to ten, or fifteen at most.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Culla must also give good security that he will coin only a\r\ndeterminate sum, not exceeding twenty thousand pounds; by which,\r\nalthough he should deal with all uprightness imaginable, and make his\r\ncoin as good as that I weighed of King Charles II., he will, at sixteen\r\nper cent., gain three thousand two hundred pounds; a very good\r\nadditional job to a private tradesman's fortune!\r\n\r\nI must advise him also to employ better workmen, and make his\r\nimpressions deeper and plainer; by which a rising rim may be left about\r\nthe edge of his coin, to preserve the letter from wearing out too soon.\r\nHe hath no wardens nor masters, or other officers of the mint, to suck\r\nup his profit; and therefore can afford to coin cheaper than the Crown,\r\nif he will but find good materials, proper implements, and skilful\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nWhether this project will succeed in Mr. M'Culla's hands, (which, if it\r\nbe honestly executed, I should be glad to see,) one thing I am confident\r\nof, that it might be easily brought to perfection by a society of nine\r\nor ten honest gentlemen of fortune, who wish well to their country, and\r\nwould be content to be neither gainers nor losers, further than the bare\r\ninterest of their money. And Mr. M'Culla, as being the first starter of\r\nthe scheme, might be considered and rewarded by such a society; whereof,\r\nalthough I am not a man of fortune, I should think it an honour and\r\nhappiness to be one, even with borrowed money upon the best security I\r\ncould give. And, first, I am confident, without any skill, but by\r\ngeneral reason, that the charge of coining copper would be very much\r\nless than thirty per cent. Secondly, I believe ten thousand pounds, in\r\nhalfpence and farthings, would be sufficient for the whole kingdom, even\r\nunder our great and most unnecessary distress for the want of silver;\r\nand that, without such a distress, half the sum would suffice. For, I\r\ncompute and reason thus: the city of Dublin, by a gross computation,\r\ncontains ten thousand families; and I am told by shopkeepers, \"That if\r\nsilver were as plenty as usual, two shillings in copper would be\r\nsufficient, in the course of business, for each family.\" But, in\r\nconsideration of the want of silver, I would allow five shillings to\r\neach family, which would amount to _2,500l._; and, to help this, I would\r\nrecommend a currency of all the genuine undefaced harp-halfpence, which\r\nare left, of Lord Dartmouth's and Moor's patents under King Charles II.;\r\nand the small Patrick and David for farthings. To the rest of the\r\nkingdom, I would assign the _7,50l._ remaining; reckoning Dublin to\r\nanswer one-fourth of the kingdom, as London is judged to answer (if I\r\nmistake not) one-third of England; I mean in the view of money only.\r\n\r\nTo compute our want of small change by the number of souls in the\r\nkingdom, besides being perplexed, is, I think, by no means just. They\r\nhave been reckoned at a million and a half; whereof a million at least\r\nare beggars in all circumstances, except that of wandering about for\r\nalms; and that circumstance may arrive soon enough, when it will be time\r\nto add another ten thousand pounds in copper. But, without doubt, the\r\nfamilies of Ireland, who lie chiefly under the difficulties of wanting\r\nsmall change, cannot be above forty or fifty thousand, which the sum of\r\nten thousand pounds, with the addition of the fairest old halfpence,\r\nwould tolerably supply; for, if we give too great a loose to any\r\nprojector to pour in upon us what he pleases, the kingdom will be, (how\r\nshall I express it under our present circumstances?) more than undone.\r\n\r\nAnd hence appears, in a very strong light, the villainy of Wood, who\r\nproposed the coinage of one hundred and eight thousand pounds in copper,\r\nfor the use of Ireland; whereby every family in the kingdom would be\r\nloaden with ten or a dozen shillings, although Wood might not transgress\r\nthe bounds of his patent, and although no counterfeits, either at home\r\nor abroad, were added to the number; the contrary to both which would\r\nindubitably have arrived. So ill informed are great men on the other\r\nside, who talk of a million with as little ceremony as we do of\r\nhalf-a-crown!\r\n\r\nBut to return to the proposal I have made: Suppose ten gentlemen, lovers\r\nof their country, should raise _200l._ a-piece; and, from the time the\r\nmoney is deposited as they shall agree, should begin to charge it with\r\nseven per cent. for their own use; that they should, as soon as\r\npossible, provide a mint and good workmen, and buy copper sufficient for\r\ncoining two thousand pounds, subtracting a fifth part of the interest of\r\nten thousand pounds for the charges of the tools, and fitting up a place\r\nfor a mint; the other four parts of the same interest to be subtracted\r\nequally out of the four remaining coinages of _2,000l._ each, with a\r\njust allowance for other necessary incidents. Let the charge of coinage\r\nbe fairly reckoned, and the kingdom informed of it, as well as of the\r\nprice of copper. Let the coin be as well and deeply stamped as it ought.\r\nLet the metal be as pure as can consist to have it rightly coined,\r\n(wherein I am wholly ignorant,) and the bulk as large as that of King\r\nCharles II. And let this club of ten gentlemen give their joint security\r\nto receive all the coins they issue out for seven or ten years, and\r\nreturn gold and silver without any defalcation.\r\n\r\nLet the same club, or company, when they have issued out the first two\r\nthousand pounds, go on the second year, if they find a demand, and that\r\ntheir scheme hath answered to their own intention, as well as to the\r\nsatisfaction of the public. And, if they find seven per cent. not\r\nsufficient, let them subtract eight, beyond which I would not have them\r\ngo. And when they have in five years coined ten thousand pounds, let\r\nthem give public notice that they will proceed no further, but shut up\r\ntheir mint, and dismiss their workmen; unless the real, universal,\r\nunsolicited, declaration of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom shall\r\nsignify a desire that they shall go on for a certain sum farther.\r\n\r\nThis company may enter into certain regulations among themselves; one of\r\nwhich should be, to keep nothing concealed, and duly to give an account\r\nto the world of their whole methods of acting.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to compute, wholly at random, what charge the kingdom will\r\nbe at, by the loss of intrinsic value in the coinage of _10,000l._ in\r\ncopper, under the management of such a society of gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFirst, It is plain that instead of somewhat more than sixteen per cent.\r\nas demanded by Mr. M'Culla, this society desires but eight per cent.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Whereas Mr. M'Culla charges the expense of coinage at thirty\r\nper cent., I hope and believe this society will be able to perform it at\r\nten.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Whereas it doth not appear that Mr. M'Culla can give any\r\nsecurity for the goodness of his copper, because not one in ten thousand\r\nhave the skill to distinguish, the society will be all engaged that\r\ntheirs shall be of the best standard.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That whereas Mr. M'Culla's halfpence are one-fourth part\r\nlighter than that kind coined in the time of King Charles II., these\r\ngentlemen will oblige themselves to the public, to give their coin of\r\nthe same weight and goodness with those halfpence, unless they shall\r\nfind they cannot afford it; and, in that case, they shall beforehand\r\ninform the public, show their reasons, and signify how large they can\r\nmake them without being losers; and so give over or pursue their scheme,\r\nas they find the opinion of the world to be. However, I do not doubt but\r\nthey can afford them as large, and of as good metal, as the best English\r\nhalfpence that have been coined in the three last reigns, which very\r\nmuch outweighed those of Mr. M'Culla. And this advantage will arise in\r\nproportion, by lessening the charge of coinage from thirty per cent. to\r\nten or fifteen, or twenty at most. But I confess myself in the dark on\r\nthat article; only I think it impossible it should amount to any\r\nproportion near thirty per cent.; otherwise the coiners of those\r\ncounterfeit halfpence called raps[117] would have little encouragement\r\nto follow their trade.\r\n\r\nBut the indubitable advantages, by having the management in such a\r\nsociety, would be the paying eight per cent. instead of sixteen, the\r\nbeing sure of the goodness and just weight of the coin, and the period\r\nto be put to any further coinage than what was absolutely necessary to\r\nsupply the wants and desires of the kingdom; and all this under the\r\nsecurity of ten gentlemen of credit and fortune, who would be ready to\r\ngive the best security and satisfaction, that they had no design to turn\r\nthe scheme into a job.\r\n\r\nAs to any mistakes I have made in computation, they are of little\r\nmoment; and I shall not descend so low as to justify them against any\r\ncaviller.\r\n\r\nThe strongest objection against what I offer, and which perhaps may make\r\nit appear visionary, is the difficulty to find half a score gentlemen,\r\nwho, out of a public spirit, will be at the trouble, for no more profit\r\nthan one per cent. above the legal interest, to be overseers of a mint\r\nfor five years; and perhaps, without any justice, raise the clamour of\r\nthe people against them. Besides, it is most certain that many a squire\r\nis as fond of a job, and as dexterous to make the best of it, as Mr.\r\nM'Culla himself, or any of his level.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not doubt but there may be ten such persons in this town,\r\nif they had only some visible mark to know them at sight. Yet I just\r\nforesee another inconveniency; That knavish men are fitter to deal with\r\nothers of their own denomination; while those who are honest and\r\nbest-intentioned may be the instruments of as much mischief to the\r\npublic, for want of cunning, as the greatest knaves; and more, because\r\nof the charitable opinion which they are apt to have of others.\r\nTherefore, how to join the prudence of the serpent with the innocency of\r\nthe dove, in this affair, is the most difficult point. It is not so hard\r\nto find an honest man, as to make this honest man active, and vigilant,\r\nand skilful; which, I doubt, will require a spur of profit greater than\r\nmy scheme will afford him, unless he will be contented with the honour\r\nof serving his country, and the reward of a good conscience.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing what I had written, I see very well that I have not\r\ngiven any allowance for the first charge of preparing all things\r\nnecessary for coining, which, I am told, will amount to about _200l._\r\nbesides _20l._ per annum for five years rent of a house to work in. I\r\ncan only say, that, this making in all _300l._, it will be an addition\r\nof no more than three per cent. out of _10,000l._\r\n\r\nBut the great advantages to the public, by having the coinage placed in\r\nthe hands of ten gentlemen such as I have already described, (if such\r\nare to be found,) are these:--\r\n\r\nFirst, They propose no other gain to themselves than one per cent. above\r\nthe legal interest for the money they advance; which will hardly afford\r\nthem coffee when they meet at their mint-house.\r\n\r\nSecondly, They bind themselves to make their coins of as good copper as\r\nthe best English halfpence, and as well coined, and of equal weight; and\r\ndo likewise bind themselves to charge the public with not one farthing\r\nfor the expense of coinage, more than it shall really stand them in.\r\n\r\nThirdly, They will, for a limited term of seven or ten years, as shall\r\nbe thought proper upon mature consideration, pay gold and silver,\r\nwithout any defalcation, for all their own coin that shall be returned\r\nupon their hands.\r\n\r\nFourthly, They will take care that the coins shall have a deep\r\nimpression, leaving a rising rim on both sides, to prevent being\r\ndefaced in a long time; and the edges shall be milled.\r\n\r\nI suppose they need not be very apprehensive of counterfeits, which it\r\nwill be difficult to make so as not to be discovered; for it is plain\r\nthat those bad halfpence called raps are so easily distinguished, even\r\nfrom the most worn genuine halfpenny, that nobody will now take them for\r\na farthing, although under the great present want of change.\r\n\r\nI shall here subjoin some computations relating to Mr. M'Culla's copper\r\nnotes. They were sent to me by a person well skilled in such\r\ncalculations; and therefore I refer them to the reader.[118]\r\n\r\nMr. M'Culla charges good copper at fourteenpence per pound: but I know\r\nnot whether he means avoirdupois or troy weight.\r\n\r\n  Avoirdupois is sixteen ounces to a pound,                    6960 grains.\r\n  A pound troy weight,                                         5760 grains.\r\n    Mr. M'Culla's copper is fourteenpence per pound avoirdupois.\r\n  Two of Mr. M'Culla's penny notes, one with another, weigh     524 grains.\r\n  By which computation, two shillings of his notes, which he\r\n    sells for one pound weight, will weigh                     6288 grains.\r\n  But one pound avoirdupois weighs, as above,                  6960 grains.\r\n    This difference makes 10 per cent.\r\n    to Mr. M'Culla's profit, in point of weight.\r\n    The old Patrick and David halfpenny weighs                  149 grains.\r\n    Mr. M'Culla's halfpenny weighs                              131 grains.\r\n                                                               ------\r\n                                         The difference is       18\r\n\r\n  Which is equal to 10-1/2 per cent.\r\n  The English halfpenny of King Charles II. weighs              167 grains.\r\n  M'Culla's halfpenny weighs                                    131 grains.\r\n                                                               ------\r\n                                             The difference      36\r\n\r\n  Which difference, allowed a fifth part, is 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER COMPUTATION.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Culla allows his pound of copper (coinage included) to be worth\r\ntwentypence; for which he demands two shillings.\r\n\r\n  His coinage he computes at sixpence per pound weight; therefore,\r\n    he laying out only twentypence, and gaining fourpence,\r\n    he makes per cent. profit,                                        20\r\n  The sixpence per pound weight, allowed for coinage,\r\n    makes per cent.                                                   30\r\n  The want of weight in his halfpenny, compared as above,\r\n    is per cent.                                                      10\r\n  By all which (viz. coinage, profit, and want of weight)\r\n    --the public loses per cent.                                      60\r\n\r\nIf Mr. M'Culla's coins will not pass, and he refuses to receive them\r\nback, the owner cannot sell them at above twelvepence per pound weight;\r\nwhereby, with the defect of weight of 10 per cent., he will lose 60 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of the society, raised as high as it can possibly be, will be\r\nonly thus:\r\n\r\n  For interest of their money, per cent.                               8\r\n  For coinage, instead of 10, suppose at most per cent.               20\r\n  For _l.300_ laid out for tools, a mint, and house-rent,\r\n    charge 3 per cent. upon the coinage of _l.10,000_,                 3\r\n                                                                     ----\r\n  Charges in all upon interest, coinage, &c. per cent.,               31\r\n\r\nWhich, with all the advantages above-mentioned, of the goodness of the\r\nmetal, the largeness of the coin, the deepness and fairness of the\r\nimpression, the assurance of the society confining itself to such a sum\r\nas they undertake, or as the kingdom shall approve; and lastly, their\r\npaying in gold or silver for all their coin returned upon their hands\r\nwithout any defalcation, would be of mighty benefit to the kingdom; and,\r\nwith a little steadiness and activity, could, I doubt not, be easily\r\ncompassed.\r\n\r\nI would not in this scheme recommend the method of promissory notes,\r\nafter Mr. M'Culla's manner; but, as I have seen in old Irish coins, the\r\nwords CIVITAS DVBLIN, on one side, with the year of our Lord\r\nand the Irish harp on the reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nTHAT\r\n\r\nALL THE LADIES AND WOMEN OF IRELAND\r\n\r\nSHOULD APPEAR CONSTANTLY IN\r\n\r\nIRISH MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The arguments advanced in this tract are practically repetitions of\r\n     those already given in previous pieces. Swift laid much stress on\r\n     the people buying and wearing goods made in Ireland, since in that\r\n     way the money would remain in the country. In this little tract he\r\n     winds up with a special appeal to the women of Ireland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The present text is based on that of the quarto edition (vol.\r\n     viii.) of 1765, and compared with Faulkner's of 1772.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL THAT ALL THE LADIES AND WOMEN OF IRELAND SHOULD APPEAR\r\nCONSTANTLY IN IRISH MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a treatise written about nine years ago, to persuade the\r\npeople of Ireland to wear their own manufactures.[119] This treatise was\r\nallowed to have not one syllable in it of party or disaffection; but was\r\nwholly founded upon the growing poverty of the nation, occasioned by the\r\nutter want of trade in every branch, except that ruinous importation of\r\nall foreign extravagancies from other countries. This treatise was\r\npresented, by the grand jury of the city and county of Dublin, as a\r\nscandalous, seditious, and factious pamphlet. I forget who was the\r\nforeman of the city grand jury; but the foreman for the county was one\r\nDoctor Seal, register to the Archbishop of Dublin, wherein he differed\r\nmuch from the sentiments of his lord.[120] The printer[121] was tried\r\nbefore the late Mr. Whitshed, that famous Lord chief-justice; who, on\r\nthe bench, laying his hand on his heart, declared, upon his salvation,\r\nthat the author was a Jacobite, and had a design to beget a quarrel\r\nbetween the two nations.[122] In the midst of this prosecution, about\r\nfifteen hundred weavers were forced to beg their bread, and had a\r\ngeneral contribution made for their relief, which just served to make\r\nthem drunk for a week; and then they were forced to turn rogues, or\r\nstrolling beggars, or to leave the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Grafton,[123] who was then Lieutenant, being perfectly\r\nashamed of so infamous and unpopular a proceeding, obtained from England\r\na _noli prosequi_ for the printer. Yet the grand jury had solemn thanks\r\ngiven them from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nI mention this passage (perhaps too much forgotten,) to shew how\r\ndangerous it hath been for the best meaning person to write one syllable\r\nin the defence of his country, or discover the miserable condition it is\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAnd to prove this truth, I will produce one instance more; wholly\r\nomitting the famous case of the Drapier, and the proclamation against\r\nhim, as well as the perverseness of another jury against the same Mr.\r\nWhitshed, who was violently bent to act the second part in another\r\nscene.[124]\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, there was a small paper printed, which was called,\r\n\"A Short View of the State of Ireland,\" relating the several causes\r\nwhereby any country may grow rich, and applying them to Ireland.[125]\r\nWhitshed was dead, and consequently the printer was not troubled. Mist,\r\nthe famous journalist, happened to reprint this paper in London, for\r\nwhich his press-folks were prosecuted for almost a twelve-month; and,\r\nfor aught I know, are not yet discharged.[126]\r\n\r\nThis is our case; insomuch, that although I am often without money in my\r\npocket, I dare not own it in some company, for fear of being thought\r\ndisaffected.\r\n\r\nBut, since I am determined to take care that the author of this paper\r\nshall not be discovered (following herein the most prudent practice of\r\nthe Drapier,) I will venture to affirm, that the three seasons wherein\r\nour corn hath miscarried, did no more contribute to our present misery,\r\nthan one spoonful of water thrown upon a rat already drowned would\r\ncontribute to his death; and that the present plentiful harvest,\r\nalthough it should be followed by a dozen ensuing, would no more restore\r\nus, than it would the rat aforesaid to put him near the fire, which\r\nmight indeed warm his fur coat, but never bring him back to life.\r\n\r\nThe short of the matter is this: The distresses of the kingdom are\r\noperating more and more every day, by very large degrees, and so have\r\nbeen doing for above a dozen years past.\r\n\r\nIf you demand from whence these distresses have arisen, I desire to ask\r\nthe following question:\r\n\r\nIf two-thirds of any kingdom's revenue be exported to another country,\r\nwithout one farthing of value in return; and if the said kingdom be\r\nforbidden the most profitable branches of trade wherein to employ the\r\nother third, and only allowed to traffic in importing those commodities\r\nwhich are most ruinous to itself[127]; how shall that kingdom stand?\r\n\r\nIf this question were formed into the first proposition of an\r\nhypothetical syllogism, I defy the man born in Ireland, who is now in\r\nthe fairest way of getting a collectorship, or a cornet's post, to give\r\na good reason for denying it.\r\n\r\nLet me put another case. Suppose a gentleman's estate of two hundred\r\npounds a year should sink to one hundred, by some accident, whether by\r\nan earthquake, or inundation, it matters not: and suppose the said\r\ngentleman utterly hopeless and unqualified ever to retrieve the loss;\r\nhow is he otherwise to proceed in his future economy, than by reducing\r\nit on every article to one half less, unless he will be content to fly\r\nhis country, or rot in jail? This is a representation of Ireland's\r\ncondition; only with one fault, that it is a little too favourable.\r\nNeither am I able to propose a full remedy for this, that shall ever be\r\ngranted, but only a small prolongation of life, until God shall\r\nmiraculously dispose the hearts of our neighbours, our kinsmen, our\r\nfellow-protestants, fellow-subjects, and fellow rational creatures, to\r\npermit us to starve without running further in debt. I am informed that\r\nour national debt (and God knows how we wretches came by that\r\nfashionable thing a national debt) is about two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand pounds; which is at least one-third of the whole kingdom's\r\nrents, after our absentees and other foreign drains are paid, and about\r\nfifty thousand pounds more than all the cash.\r\n\r\nIt seems there are several schemes for raising a fund to pay the\r\ninterest of this formidable sum (not the principal, for this is allowed\r\nimpossible). The necessity of raising such a fund, is strongly and\r\nregularly pleaded, from the late deficiencies in the duties and customs.\r\nAnd is it the fault of Ireland that these funds are deficient? If they\r\ndepend on trade, can it possibly be otherwise, while we have neither\r\nliberty to trade, nor money to trade with; neither hands to work, nor\r\nbusiness to employ them, if we had? Our diseases are visible enough both\r\nin their causes and effects; and the cures are well known, but\r\nimpossible to be applied.\r\n\r\nIf my steward comes and tells me, that my rents are sunk so low, that\r\nthey are very little more than sufficient to pay my servants their\r\nwages; have I any other course left than to cashier four in six of my\r\nrascally footmen, and a number of other varlets in my family, of whose\r\ninsolence the whole neighbourhood complains? And I should think it\r\nextremely severe in any law, to force me to maintain a household of\r\nfifty servants, and fix their wages, before I had offered my rent-roll\r\nupon oath to the legislators.\r\n\r\nTo return from digressing: I am told one scheme for raising a fund to\r\npay the interest of our national debt, is, by a further duty of forty\r\nshillings a tun upon wine. Some gentlemen would carry this matter much\r\nfurther, by raising it to twelve pounds; which, in a manner, would\r\namount to a prohibition: thus weakly arguing from the practice of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI have often taken notice, both in print and in discourse, that there is\r\nno topic so fallacious, either in talk or in writing, as to argue how we\r\nought to act in Ireland, from the example of England, Holland, France,\r\nor any other country, whose inhabitants are allowed the common rights\r\nand liberties of humankind. I could undertake to name six or seven of\r\nthe most uncontrolled maxims in government, which are utterly false in\r\nthis kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs to the additional duty on wine, I think any person may deliver his\r\nopinion upon it, until it shall have passed into a law; and till then, I\r\ndeclare mine to be positively against it.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because there is no nation yet known, in either hemisphere, where\r\nthe people of all conditions are more in want of some cordial to keep up\r\ntheir spirits, than in this of ours. I am not in jest; and if the fact\r\nwill not be allowed me, I shall not argue it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, It is too well and generally known, that this tax of forty\r\nshillings additional on every tun of wine, (which will be double, at\r\nleast, to the home consumer) will increase equally every new session of\r\nParliament, until, perhaps, it comes to twelve pounds.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Because, as the merchants inform me, and as I have known many\r\nthe like instances in England, this additional tax will more probably\r\nlessen this branch of the revenue, than increase it. And therefore Sir\r\nJohn Stanley, a commissioner of the customs in England, used to say,\r\nthat the House of Commons were generally mistaken in matters of trade,\r\nby an erroneous opinion that two and two make four. Thus, if you should\r\nlay an additional duty of one penny a pound on raisins or sugar, the\r\nrevenue, instead of rising, would certainly sink; and the consequence\r\nwould only be, to lessen the number of plum-puddings, and ruin the\r\nconfectioner.\r\n\r\nFourthly, I am likewise assured by merchants, that upon this additional\r\nforty shillings, the French will at least equally raise their duties\r\nupon all commodities we export thither.\r\n\r\nFifthly, If an original extract of the exports and imports be true, we\r\nhave been gainers, upon the balance, by our trade with France, for\r\nseveral years past; and, although our gain amounts to no great sum, we\r\nought to be satisfied, since we are no losers, with the only consolation\r\nwe are capable of receiving.\r\n\r\nLastly, The worst consequence is behind. If we raise the duty on wine to\r\na considerable height, we lose the only hold we have of keeping among us\r\nthe few gentlemen of any tolerable estates. I am confident there is\r\nhardly a gentleman of eight hundred pounds a year and upwards, in this\r\nkingdom, who would balance half an hour to consider whether he should\r\nlive here or in England, if a family could be as cheaply maintained in\r\nthe one as the other. As to eatables, they are as cheap in many fine\r\ncounties of England, as in some very indifferent ones here; or, if there\r\nbe any difference, that vein of thrift and prudence in economy, which\r\npasses there without reproach, (and chiefly in London itself,) would\r\namply make up the difference. But the article of French wine is hardly\r\ntolerable, in any degree of plenty, to a middling fortune; and this is\r\nit, which, by growing habitual, wholly turns the scale with those few\r\nlanded men, disengaged from employments, who content themselves to live\r\nhospitably with plenty of good wine in their own country, rather than in\r\npenury and obscurity in another, with bad, or with none at all.\r\n\r\nHaving, therefore, as far as in me lies, abolished this additional duty\r\nupon wine; for I am not under the least concern about paying the\r\ninterest of the national debt, but leave it, as in loyalty bound, wholly\r\nto the wisdom of the honourable House of Commons; I come now to consider\r\nby what methods we may be able to put off and delay our utter undoing as\r\nlong as it is possible.\r\n\r\nI never have discoursed with any reasonable man upon this subject, who\r\ndid not allow that there was no remedy left us, but to lessen the\r\nimportation of all unnecessary commodities as much as it was possible;\r\nand likewise either to persuade our absentees to spend their money at\r\nhome, which is impossible; or tax them at five shillings in the pound\r\nduring their absence, with such allowances, upon necessary occasions, as\r\nit shall be thought convenient: or, by permitting us a free trade, which\r\nis denied to no other nation upon earth. The three last methods are\r\ntreated by Mr. Prior, in his most useful treatise, added to his list of\r\nabsentees.[128]\r\n\r\nIt is to gratify the vanity, and pride, and luxury of the women, and of\r\nthe young fops who admire them, that we owe this insupportable\r\ngrievance, of bringing in the instruments of our ruin. There is annually\r\nbrought over to this kingdom near ninety thousand pounds worth of silk,\r\nwhereof the greater part is manufactured. Thirty thousand pounds more is\r\nexpended in muslin, holland, cambric, and calico. What the price of lace\r\namounts to, is not easy to be collected from the custom-house book,\r\nbeing a kind of goods that takes up little room, and is easily run; but,\r\nconsidering the prodigious price of a woman's head-dress, at ten,\r\ntwelve, twenty pounds a yard, must be very great. The tea, rated at\r\nseven shillings per pound, comes to near twelve thousand pounds; but,\r\nconsidering it as the common luxury of every chambermaid, sempstress,\r\nand tradesman's wife, both in town and country, however they come by it,\r\nmust needs cost the kingdom double that sum. Coffee is somewhere above\r\nseven thousand pounds. I have seen no account of the chocolate, and some\r\nother Indian or American goods. The drapery imported is about\r\nfour-and-twenty thousand pounds. The whole amounts (with one or two\r\nother particulars) to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. The\r\nlavishing of all which money is just as prudent and necessary, as to see\r\na man in an embroidered coat, begging out of Newgate in an old shoe.\r\n\r\nI allow that the thrown and raw silk is less pernicious, because we have\r\nsome share in the manufacture: but we are not now in circumstances to\r\ntrifle. It costs us above forty thousand pounds a-year; and if the\r\nladies, till better times, will not be content to go in their own\r\ncountry shifts, I wish they may go in rags.\r\n\r\nLet them vie with each other in the fineness of their native linen:\r\ntheir beauty and gentleness will as well appear, as if they were covered\r\nover with diamonds and brocade.\r\n\r\nI believe no man is so weak, as to hope or expect that such a\r\nreformation can be brought about by a law. But a thorough hearty,\r\nunanimous vote, in both houses of Parliament, might perhaps answer as\r\nwell: every senator, noble or plebeian, giving his honour, that neither\r\nhimself, nor any of his family, would, in their dress, or furniture of\r\ntheir houses, make use of anything except what was of the growth and\r\nmanufacture of this kingdom; and that they would use the utmost of their\r\npower, influence, and credit, to prevail on their tenants, dependants,\r\nand friends, to follow their example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nMODEST PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nFOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE\r\n\r\nFROM BEING A BURTHEN TO THEIR PARENTS\r\n\r\nOR COUNTRY, AND FOR MAKING THEM BENEFICIAL\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Perhaps in no literature is there to be found a piece of writing in\r\n     any sense comparable to this \"Modest Proposal.\" Written,\r\n     apparently, in a light and comic vein, it might deceive the casual\r\n     reader into the belief that Swift had achieved a joke. It has the\r\n     air of a smiling and indifferent _raconteur_ amusing an\r\n     after-dinner table. In truth, however, this piece of writing is a\r\n     terrible indictment made by an advocate speaking against the result\r\n     of a tyranny of power which, through wicked stupidity or complacent\r\n     indifference, had afflicted a people almost to extinction. The\r\n     restraint of the writer evinced in this tract, is the more\r\n     remarkable, when we remember that he was Ireland's foremost\r\n     patriot, that he had been her champion for liberty and\r\n     independence, and that an indignation filled him at all times,\r\n     lacerating his heart, against the cruelty and oppression and\r\n     wretchedness of humanity generally. Here, he sits down and writes\r\n     as calmly as if composing an ordinary sermon, and proposes, in cold\r\n     blood, to alleviate the poverty of the Irish people by the sale of\r\n     their children as table food for the rich. He even goes into\r\n     calculations as to cost of breeding, and shows how a mother might\r\n     earn eight shillings a year on each child, by disposing of its\r\n     carcass for ten shillings. Of the million and a half people who\r\n     inhabit the country, he assumes that there are 200,000 who beget\r\n     children; of these about 30,000 are able to provide for their\r\n     offspring, but the balance of 170,000 must inevitably become a\r\n     burden. What is to become of them? Many schemes have been proposed\r\n     to meet their case, but not one of them has answered. Trade and\r\n     agriculture gave them no opportunity, since the trade of the\r\n     country was almost at a standstill, and land was now either too\r\n     dear to keep or too poor to cultivate. At the time of Swift's\r\n     writing Ireland had passed through three frightful years of famine.\r\n     Corn had become so dear that riots occurred at the ports where what\r\n     corn remained was being exported. The land, as Swift wrote to Pope\r\n     (August 11th, 1729) was in every place strewn with beggars. The\r\n     poor labourer, had work been found for him, was too weak in body to\r\n     undertake it. Thousands had already died of starvation and the\r\n     diseases consequent on hunger. Those that managed to exist did so\r\n     in filth, and dying every day, as Swift wrote on another occasion,\r\n     \"and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth and vermin.\"\r\n\r\n     No, there was only one way out of the difficulty, and that was to\r\n     have these poor people breed children, which they could profitably\r\n     dispose of for food. Let them fatten their offspring as best they\r\n     could and sell them dead or alive for cooking. The irony of the\r\n     proposition may sound appalling to us in this century, but Swift\r\n     was not exaggerating the distress of his day. Even Primate Boulter,\r\n     who was certainly the last man to overstate an Irish case, sent\r\n     such reports as gave the English Government anxiety. To Swift it\r\n     was no time for polite speeches and calm proposals. He had already\r\n     given them in abundance. Now was the time for something merry and\r\n     with laughter:\r\n\r\n       \"I may storm and rage in vain;\r\n       It but stupifies your brain.\r\n       But with raillery to nettle,\r\n       Set your thoughts upon their mettle.\"\r\n\r\n     It was in this spirit that the \"Modest Proposal\" was written. Swift\r\n     concludes with a final touch by telling us that he has nothing to\r\n     gain personally by his suggestion, since his \"youngest child is\r\n     nine and his wife past child-bearing.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is that of the original issue\r\n     collated with that given by Faulkner.\r\n\r\n     [T.

Roberts_ in _Warwick-lane_, and\r\nthe Pamphlet-Shops.\r\n\r\nM.DCC.XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODEST PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nFOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE FROM BEING A BURTHEN TO THEIR\r\nPARENTS OR COUNTRY, AND FOR MAKING THEM BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or\r\ntravel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and\r\ncabin-doors, crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,\r\nfour, or six children, _all in rags_, and importuning every passenger\r\nfor an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their\r\nhonest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in strolling, to\r\nbeg sustenance for their helpless infants, who, as they grow up, either\r\nturn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear Native Country to\r\nfight for the Pretender in Spain,[129] or sell themselves to the\r\nBarbadoes.\r\n\r\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\r\nchildren, in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their\r\nmothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable\r\nstate of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore\r\nwhoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these\r\nchildren sound useful members of the commonwealth would deserve so well\r\nof the public, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBut my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for\r\nthe children of professed beggars, it is of a much greater extent, and\r\nshall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born\r\nof parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand\r\nour charity in the streets.\r\n\r\nAs to my own part, having turned my thoughts, for many years, upon this\r\nimportant subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of other\r\nprojectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\r\ncomputation. It is true a child, just dropped from its dam, may be\r\nsupported by her milk for a solar year with little other nourishment, at\r\nmost not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\r\ncertainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\r\nbegging, and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for\r\nthem, in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their\r\nparents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of\r\ntheir lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding and\r\npartly to the clothing of many thousands.\r\n\r\nThere as likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\r\nprevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women\r\nmurdering their bastard children, alas, too frequent among us,\r\nsacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expense,\r\nthan the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\r\ninhuman breast.\r\n\r\nThe number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\r\nand a half,[130] of these I calculate there may be about two hundred\r\nthousand couple whose wives are breeders, from which number I subtract\r\nthirty thousand couples, who are able to maintain their own children,\r\nalthough I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present\r\ndistresses of the kingdom, but this being granted, there will remain an\r\nhundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand\r\nfor those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident, or\r\ndisease within the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty\r\nthousand children of poor parents annually born: The question therefore\r\nis, how this number shall be reared, and provided for, which, as I have\r\nalready said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly\r\nimpossible by all the methods hitherto proposed, for we can neither\r\nemploy them in handicraft, or agriculture; we neither build houses, (I\r\nmean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a\r\nlivelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old, except where\r\nthey are of towardly parts, although, I confess they learn the rudiments\r\nmuch earlier, during which time, they can however be properly looked\r\nupon only as _probationers_, as I have been informed by a principal\r\ngentleman in the County of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never\r\nknew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of\r\nthe kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\r\n\r\nI am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years\r\nold, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they\r\nwill not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half-a-crown at\r\nmost on the Exchange, which cannot turn to account either to the parents\r\nor the kingdom, the charge of nutriment and rags having been at least\r\nfour times that value.\r\n\r\nI shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will\r\nnot be liable to the least objection.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in\r\nLondon,[131] that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a\r\nmost delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,\r\nbaked, or boiled, and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a\r\nfricassee, or a ragout.\r\n\r\nI do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration, that of the\r\nhundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand\r\nmay be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males,\r\nwhich is more than we allow to sheep, black-cattle, or swine, and my\r\nreason is that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a\r\ncircumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore one male will\r\nbe sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand\r\nmay at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality, and\r\nfortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them\r\nsuck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat\r\nfor a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for\r\nfriends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will\r\nmake a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will\r\nbe very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.\r\n\r\nI have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12\r\npounds, and in a solar year if tolerably nursed increaseth to 28 pounds.\r\n\r\nI grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for\r\nlandlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem\r\nto have the best title to the children.\r\n\r\nInfants' flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful\r\nin March, and a little before and after, for we are told by a grave\r\nauthor an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolific diet,\r\nthere are more children born in Roman Catholic countries about nine\r\nmonths after Lent, than at any other season; therefore reckoning a year\r\nafter Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because the\r\nnumber of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and\r\ntherefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the\r\nnumber of Papists among us.\r\n\r\nI have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which\r\nlist I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers)\r\nto be about two shillings _per annum_, rags included, and I believe no\r\ngentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good\r\nfat child, which, as I have said will make four dishes of excellent\r\nnutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his own\r\nfamily to dine with him. Thus the Squire will learn to be a good\r\nlandlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight\r\nshillings net profit, and be fit for work till she produces another\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThose who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may\r\nflay the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make\r\nadmirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAs to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in\r\nthe most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not\r\nbe wanting, although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and\r\ndressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.\r\n\r\nA very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I\r\nhighly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to\r\noffer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this\r\nkingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want\r\nof venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and\r\nmaidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve, so great\r\na number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve, for\r\nwant of work and service: and these to be disposed of by their parents\r\nif alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due\r\ndeference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I cannot\r\nbe altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American\r\nacquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was\r\ngenerally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by continual\r\nexercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not\r\nanswer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think with humble\r\nsubmission, be a loss to the public, because they soon would become\r\nbreeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some\r\nscrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although\r\nindeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I\r\nconfess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any\r\nproject, however so well intended.\r\n\r\nBut in order to justify my friend, he confessed that this expedient was\r\nput into his head by the famous Psalmanazar,[132] a native of the\r\nisland Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago,\r\nand in conversation told my friend, that in his country when any young\r\nperson happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to\r\npersons of quality, as a prime dainty, and that, in his time, the body\r\nof a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison\r\nthe emperor, was sold to his Imperial Majesty's Prime Minister of State,\r\nand other great Mandarins of the Court, in joints from the gibbet, at\r\nfour hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use\r\nwere made of several plump young girls in this town, who, without one\r\nsingle groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and\r\nappear at the playhouse, and assemblies in foreign fineries, which they\r\nnever will pay for, the kingdom would not be the worse.\r\n\r\nSome persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast\r\nnumber of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed, and I have\r\nbeen desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease the\r\nnation of so grievous an encumbrance. But I am not in the least pain\r\nupon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day\r\ndying, and rotting, by cold, and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast\r\nas can be reasonably expected. And as to the younger labourers they are\r\nnow in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and\r\nconsequently pine away for want of nourishment, to a degree, that if at\r\nany time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not\r\nstrength to perform it; and thus the country and themselves are happily\r\ndelivered from the evils to come.\r\n\r\nI have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I\r\nthink the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and\r\nmany, as well as of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nFor first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the\r\nnumber of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal\r\nbreeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who\r\nstay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the\r\nPretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good\r\nProtestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at\r\nhome, and pay tithes against their conscience, to an Episcopal\r\ncurate.[133]\r\n\r\nSecondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,\r\nwhich by law may be made liable to distress, and help to pay their\r\nlandlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and _money\r\na thing unknown_.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children, from\r\ntwo years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten\r\nshillings a piece _per annum_, the nation's stock will be thereby\r\nincreased fifty thousand pounds _per annum_, besides the profit of a new\r\ndish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the\r\nkingdom, who have any refinement in taste, and the money will circulate\r\namong ourselves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nFourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings\r\nsterling _per annum_, by the sale of their children, will be rid of the\r\ncharge of maintaining them after the first year.\r\n\r\nFifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where\r\nthe vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best\r\nreceipts for dressing it to perfection, and consequently have their\r\nhouses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves\r\nupon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands\r\nhow to oblige his guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nSixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise\r\nnations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and\r\npenalties. It would increase the care and tenderness of mothers toward\r\ntheir children, when they were sure of a settlement for life, to the\r\npoor babes, provided in some sort by the public to their annual profit\r\ninstead of expense. We should see an honest emulation among the married\r\nwomen, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market, men\r\nwould become as fond of their wives, during the time of their pregnancy,\r\nas they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in calf, or sows when\r\nthey are ready to farrow, nor offer to beat or kick them (as it is too\r\nfrequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nMany other advantages might be enumerated: For instance, the addition of\r\nsome thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrelled beef; the\r\npropagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good\r\nbacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too\r\nfrequent at our tables, which are no way comparable in taste, or\r\nmagnificence to a well-grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole\r\nwill make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other\r\npublic entertainment. But this, and many others I omit being studious of\r\nbrevity.\r\n\r\nSupposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant\r\ncustomers for infants' flesh, besides others who might have it at\r\nmerry-meetings, particularly weddings and christenings, I compute that\r\nDublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses, and the\r\nrest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)\r\nthe remaining eighty thousand.\r\n\r\nI can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against\r\nthis proposal, unless it should be urged that the number of people will\r\nbe thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and was\r\nindeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the\r\nreader will observe, that I calculate my remedy _for this one\r\nindividual Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or,\r\nI think, ever can be upon earth_. Therefore let no man talk to me of\r\nother expedients: _Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of\r\nusing neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our\r\nown growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and\r\ninstruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of\r\npride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein\r\nof parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our Country,\r\nwherein we differ even from_ LAPLANDERS, _and the inhabitants\r\nof_ TOPINAMBOO:[134] _Of quitting our animosities and factions,\r\nnor act any longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the\r\nvery moment their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell\r\nour country and consciences for nothing:[135] Of teaching landlords to\r\nhave at least one degree of mercy toward their tenants. Lastly of\r\nputting a spirit of honesty, industry and skill into our shopkeepers,\r\nwho, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods,\r\nwould immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the\r\nmeasure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one\r\nfair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to\r\nit_.[136]\r\n\r\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like\r\nexpedients, till he hath at least some glimpse of hope, that there will\r\never be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them in practice.\r\n\r\nBut as to myself, having been wearied out for many years with offering\r\nvain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of\r\nsuccess, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which as it is wholly\r\nnew, so it hath something solid and real, of no expense and little\r\ntrouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in\r\n_disobliging_ ENGLAND. For this kind of commodity will not\r\nbear exportation,[137] the flesh being of too tender a consistence, to\r\nadmit a long continuance in salt, _although perhaps I could name a\r\ncountry, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it_.\r\n\r\nAfter all I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject\r\nany offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent,\r\ncheap, easy and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be\r\nadvanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire\r\nthe author, or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points.\r\nFirst, as things now stand, how they will be able to find food and\r\nraiment for an hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly,\r\nthere being a round million of creatures in human figure, throughout\r\nthis kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would\r\nleave them in debt two millions of pounds sterling adding those, who are\r\nbeggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers\r\nwith their wives and children, who are beggars in effect. I desire those\r\npoliticians, who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold to\r\nattempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these\r\nmortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness\r\nto have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe, and\r\nthereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they have\r\nsince gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of\r\npaying rent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with\r\nneither house nor clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the\r\nweather, and the most inevitable prospect of entailing the like, or\r\ngreater miseries upon their breed for ever.\r\n\r\nI profess in the sincerity of my heart that I have not the least\r\npersonal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having\r\nno other motive than the _public good of my country, by advancing our\r\ntrade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and giving some\r\npleasure to the rich_. I have no children, by which I can propose to get\r\na single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past\r\nchild-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO THE CRAFTSMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     This \"Answer\" forms an excellent continuation of the \"Modest\r\n     Proposal.\" It is in an entirely different vein, but is, in its own\r\n     way, an admirable example of Swift's strength in handling a public\r\n     question. The English government had been offering every facility\r\n     to French officers for recruiting their army from Ireland. The\r\n     \"Craftsman\" made some strong remarks on this, and Primate Boulter,\r\n     in his letter to the Duke of Newcastle, under date October 14th,\r\n     1730, told his Grace, \"that after consulting with the Lords\r\n     Justices on the subject he found that they apprehend there will be\r\n     greater difficulties in this affair than at first offered.\" He\r\n     enters into the difficulties to be overcome in order to act in\r\n     consonance with the wishes of his Majesty, and promises that\r\n     \"effectual care shall be taken that none of the officers who are\r\n     come hither, suffer on this account\" (Letter, pp. 26-27, vol. ii.,\r\n     Dublin, edit. 1770). Swift uses the matter for his own purposes and\r\n     ironically welcomes this chance for the depopulation of Ireland.\r\n     \"When our island is a desert, we will send all our raw material to\r\n     England, and receive from her all our manufactured articles. A\r\n     leather coinage will be all we want, separated, as we shall then\r\n     be, from all human kind. We shall have lost all; but we may be left\r\n     in peace, and we shall have no more to tempt the plunderer.\" Scott\r\n     styles this \"Answer\" a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of this edition is based on that given by Faulkner in the\r\n     ninth volume of his edition of Swift issued in 1772.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO THE CRAFTSMAN.[138]\r\n\r\n\r\n SIR,\r\n\r\nI detest reading your papers, because I am not of your principles, and\r\nbecause I cannot endure to be convinced. Yet I was prevailed on to\r\nperuse your Craftsman of December the 12th, wherein I discover you to be\r\nas great an enemy of this country, as you are of your own. You are\r\npleased to reflect on a project I proposed, of making the children of\r\nIrish parents to be useful to the public instead of being\r\nburdensome;[139] and you venture to assert, that your own scheme is more\r\ncharitable, of not permitting our Popish natives to be listed in the\r\nservice of any foreign prince.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, sir, you may not have heard of any kingdom so unhappy as this,\r\nboth in their imports and exports. We import a sort of goods, of no\r\nintrinsic value, which costeth us above forty thousand pounds a year to\r\ndress, and scour, and polish them, which altogether do not yield one\r\npenny advantage;[140] and we annually export above seven hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year in another kind of goods, for which we receive\r\nnot one single farthing in return; even the money paid for the letters\r\nsent in transacting this commerce being all returned to England. But\r\nnow, when there is a most lucky opportunity offered to begin a trade,\r\nwhereby this nation will save many thousand pounds a year, and England\r\nbe a prodigious gainer, you are pleased, without a call, officiously and\r\nmaliciously to interpose with very frivolous arguments.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that about sixty years ago the exportation of live\r\ncattle from hence to England was a great benefit to both kingdoms, until\r\nthat branch of traffic was stopped by an act of Parliament on your side,\r\nwhereof you have had sufficient reason to repent.[141] Upon which\r\naccount, when another act passed your Parliament, forbidding the\r\nexportation of live men to any foreign country, you were so wise to put\r\nin a clause, allowing it to be done by his Majesty's permission, under\r\nhis sign manual,[142] for which, among other great benefits granted to\r\nIreland, we are infinitely obliged to the British legislature. Yet this\r\nvery grace and favour you, Mr. D'Anvers, whom we never disobliged, are\r\nendeavouring to prevent; which, I will take upon me to say, is a\r\nmanifest mark of your disaffection to his Majesty, a want of duty to the\r\nministry, and a wicked design of oppressing this kingdom, and a\r\ntraitorous attempt to lessen the trade and manufacture of England.\r\n\r\nOur truest and best ally, the Most Christian King,[143] hath obtained\r\nhis Majesty's licence, pursuant to law, to export from hence some\r\nthousand bodies of healthy, young, living men, to supply his Irish\r\nregiments. The King of Spain, as you assert yourself, hath desired the\r\nsame civility, and seemeth to have at least as good a claim. Supposing\r\nthen that these two potentates will only desire leave to carry off six\r\nthousand men between them to France and Spain; then, by computing the\r\nmaintenance of a tall, hungry Irishman, in food and clothes, to be only\r\nat five pounds a head, here will be thirty thousand pounds per annum\r\nsaved clear to the nation; for they can find no other employment at\r\nhome, beside begging, robbing, or stealing. But, if thirty, forty, or\r\nfifty thousand (which we could gladly spare) were sent on the same\r\nerrand, what an immense benefit must it be to us! And if the two\r\nprinces, in whose service they were, should happen to be at war with\r\neach other, how soon would those recruits be destroyed! Then what a\r\nnumber of friends would the Pretender lose, and what a number of Popish\r\nenemies all true Protestants get rid of! Add to this, that then, by such\r\na practice, the lands of Ireland, that want hands for tillage, must be\r\nemployed in grazing, which would sink the price of wool, raw hides,\r\nbutter, and tallow, so that the English might have them at their own\r\nrates, and in return send us wheat to make our bread, barley to brew our\r\ndrink, and oats for our houses, without any labour of our own.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion, I desire humbly to offer a scheme, which, in my\r\nopinion, would best answer the true interests of both kingdoms: For\r\nalthough I bear a most tender filial affection to England, my dear\r\nnative country, yet I cannot deny but this noble island hath a great\r\nshare in my love and esteem; nor can I express how much I desire to see\r\nit flourish in trade and opulence, even beyond its present happy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe profitable land of this kingdom is, I think, usually computed at\r\nseventeen millions of acres, all which I propose to be wholly turned to\r\ngrazing. Now, it is found by experience, that one grazier and his family\r\ncan manage two thousand acres. Thus sixteen millions eight hundred\r\nthousand acres may be managed by eight thousand four hundred families;\r\nand the fraction of two hundred thousand acres will be more than\r\nsufficient for cabins, out-houses, and potatoe-gardens; because it is to\r\nbe understood that corn of all sorts must be sent to us from England.\r\n\r\nThese eight thousand four hundred families may be divided among the four\r\nprovinces, according to the number of houses in each province; and\r\nmaking the equal allowance of eight to a family, the number of\r\ninhabitants will amount to sixty-seven thousand two hundred souls. To\r\nthese we are to add a standing army of twenty thousand English; which,\r\ntogether with their trulls, their bastards, and their horse-boys, will,\r\nby a gross computation, very near double the count, and be very\r\nsufficient for the defence and grazing of the kingdom, as well as to\r\nenrich our neighbours, expel popery, and keep out the Pretender. And,\r\nlest the army should be at a loss for business, I think it would be very\r\nprudent to employ them in collecting the public taxes for paying\r\nthemselves and the civil list.\r\n\r\nI advise, that all the owners of these lands should live constantly in\r\nEngland, in order to learn politeness, and qualify themselves for\r\nemployments; but, for fear of increasing the natives in this island,\r\nthat an annual draught, according to the number born every year, be\r\nexported to whatever prince will bear the carriage, or transplanted to\r\nthe English dominions on the American continent, as a screen between his\r\nMajesty's English subjects and the savage Indians.\r\n\r\nI advise likewise, that no commodity whatsoever, of this nation's\r\ngrowth, should be sent to any other country except England, under the\r\npenalty of high treason; and that all the said commodities shall be sent\r\nin their natural state; the hides raw, the wool uncombed, the flax in\r\nthe stub; excepting only fish, butter, tallow, and whatever else will be\r\nspoiled in the carriage. On the contrary, that no goods whatsoever shall\r\nbe exported hither, except from England, under the same penalty: that\r\nEngland should be forced, at their own rates, to send us over clothes\r\nready made, as well as shirts and smocks to the soldiers and their\r\ntrulls; all iron, wooden, and earthen ware, and whatever furniture may\r\nbe necessary for the cabins of graziers; with a sufficient quantity of\r\ngin, and other spirits, for those who, can afford to be drunk on\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\nAs to the civil and ecclesiastical administration, which I have not yet\r\nfully considered, I can say little; only, with regard to the latter, it\r\nis plain, that the article of paying tithe for supporting speculative\r\nopinions in religion, which is so insupportable a burden to all true\r\nProtestants, and to most churchmen, will be very much lessened by this\r\nexpedient; because dry cattle pay nothing to the spiritual hireling,\r\nany more than imported corn; so that the industrious shepherd and\r\ncowherd may sit every man under his own blackberry-bush, and on his own\r\npotato-bed, whereby this happy island will become a new Arcadia.\r\n\r\nI do likewise propose, that no money shall be used in Ireland except\r\nwhat is made of leather, which likewise shall be coined in England, and\r\nimported; and that the taxes shall be levied out of the commodities we\r\nexport to England, and there turned into money for his Majesty's use;\r\nand the rents to landlords discharged in the same manner. This will be\r\nno manner of grievance, for we already see it very practicable to live\r\nwithout money, and shall be more convinced of it every day. But whether\r\npaper shall still continue to supply that defect, or whether we shall\r\nhang up all those who profess the trade of bankers, (which latter I am\r\nrather inclined to,) must be left to the consideration of wiser\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThat which maketh me more zealously bent upon this scheme, is my desire\r\nof living in amity with our neighbouring brethren; for we have already\r\ntried all other means without effect, to that blessed end: and, by the\r\ncourse of measures taken for some years past, it should seem that we are\r\nall agreed in the point.\r\n\r\nThis expedient will be of great advantage to both kingdoms, upon several\r\naccounts: for, as to England, they have a just claim to the balance of\r\ntrade on their side with the whole world: and therefore our ancestors\r\nand we, who conquered this kingdom for them, ought, in duty and\r\ngratitude, to let them have the whole benefit of that conquest to\r\nthemselves; especially when the conquest was amicably made without\r\nbloodshed, by a stipulation between the Irish princes and Henry II.; by\r\nwhich they paid him, indeed, not equal homage with what the electors of\r\nGermany do to the emperor, but very near the same that he did to the\r\nKing of France for his French dominions.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this claim from England, that kingdom may very\r\nreasonably demand the benefit of all our commodities in their natural\r\ngrowth, to be manufactured by their people, and a sufficient quantity of\r\nthem for our use to be returned hither fully manufactured.\r\n\r\nThis, on the other side, will be of great benefit to our inhabitants\r\nthe graziers; when time and labour will be too much taken up in manuring\r\ntheir ground, feeding their cattle, shearing their sheep, and sending\r\nover their oxen fit for slaughter; to which employments they are turned\r\nby nature, as descended from the Scythians, whose diet they are still so\r\nfond of. So Virgil describeth it:--\r\n\r\n  Et lac concretum cum sanguine bibit equino;\r\n\r\nWhich, in English, is bonnyclabber[144] mingled with the blood of\r\nhorses, as they formerly did, until about the beginning of the last\r\ncentury luxury, under the form of politeness, began to creep in, they\r\nchanged the blood of horses for that of their black cattle, and, by\r\nconsequence, became less warlike than their ancestors.\r\n\r\nAlthough I proposed that the army should be collectors of the public\r\nrevenues, yet I did not thereby intend that those taxes should be paid\r\nin gold or silver; but in kind, as all other rent: For, the custom of\r\ntenants making their payments in money, is a new thing in the world,\r\nlittle known in former ages, nor generally practised in any nation at\r\npresent, except this island and the southern parts of Britain. But, to\r\nmy great satisfaction, I foresee better times; the ancient manner\r\nbeginneth to be now practised in many parts of Connaught, as well as in\r\nthe county of Cork; where the squires turn tenants to themselves, divide\r\nso many cattle to their slaves, who are to provide such a quantity of\r\nbutter, hides, or tallow, still keeping up their number of cattle; and\r\ncarry the goods to Cork, or other port towns, and then sell them to the\r\nmerchants. By which invention there is no such thing as a ruined farmer\r\nto be seen; but the people live with comfort on potatoes and\r\nbonnyclabber, neither of which are vendible commodities abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nVINDICATION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY JOHN, LORD CARTERET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOHN CARTERET, EARL GRANVILLE, succeeded to the Carteret\r\n     barony at the early age of five years. He was the son of George,\r\n     the first Baron Carteret, and was born in 1690. He was educated at\r\n     Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, from which latter\r\n     place, as Swift puts it, \"he carried away more Greek, Latin, and\r\n     philosophy than properly became a person of his rank.\" In the House\r\n     of Lords Carteret was known as a strong adherent of the Protestant\r\n     succession, and joined the Sunderland party on the split of the\r\n     Whigs in 1717. As ambassador extraordinary to the Court of Sweden\r\n     he was eminently successful, being the instrument by which, in\r\n     1720, peace was established between Sweden, Prussia, and Hanover.\r\n     Later, he served in a similar capacity with Earl Stanhope and Sir\r\n     Robert Sutton at the Congress of Cambray.\r\n\r\n     In 1721 he was appointed Secretary of State of the southern\r\n     province, but although a member of the Walpole administration, he\r\n     intrigued with the King against Walpole, and attempted to form a\r\n     party in opposition to that minister. He ingratiated himself in the\r\n     King's favour by means of his knowledge of the German language (for\r\n     George knew no English), and obtained the support of Carleton,\r\n     Roxburghe, Cadogan, and the Countess of Darlington. Walpole,\r\n     however, was too strong for him. He managed to get Carteret to\r\n     Ireland as Lord Lieutenant, and the Duke of Newcastle took up the\r\n     office held by him in England. The condition of Ireland at this\r\n     time was such as to cause grave anxiety to the English government.\r\n     Carteret was sent ostensibly to a post of great importance, though,\r\n     in reality, to be out of Walpole's way. For an account of\r\n     Carteret's government during the agitation against Wood's\r\n     halfpence, the reader is referred to the sixth volume of the\r\n     present edition.\r\n\r\n     During the King's absence from England in 1723, Carteret had been\r\n     one of the lords justices of the country, and in 1725, when George\r\n     was again away, he was again appointed to this office. George,\r\n     however, died on his way to Hanover; but, on the accession of\r\n     George II., Carteret continued to hold high office. He was\r\n     re-appointed to the Irish Lord Lieutenancy in 1727, and it was\r\n     during this second term that he was criticised for the conduct\r\n     Swift vindicates in the following tract.\r\n\r\n     The Dean had a great admiration both for the scholarship and temper\r\n     of Carteret. The admiration was mutual, for Carteret often\r\n     consulted with Swift on important matters, and, though he dared not\r\n     appoint the Drapier to any position of importance, he took occasion\r\n     to assist the Drapier's friends. At the time of the proclamation\r\n     against the Drapier's fourth letter, the Dean, writes Scott,\r\n     \"visited the Castle, and having waited for some time without seeing\r\n     the Lord Lieutenant, wrote upon one of the windows of the chamber\r\n     of audience these lines:\r\n\r\n       'My very good lord, 'tis a very hard task,\r\n       For a man to wait here, who has nothing to ask.'\r\n\r\n     Under which Carteret wrote the following happy reply:\r\n\r\n       'My very good Dean, there are few who come here,\r\n       But have something to ask, or something to fear.'\"\r\n\r\n     To Carteret's politic government of Ireland was mainly due the\r\n     peaceful condition which prevailed amidst all the agitation roused\r\n     by bad management and wretchedness. In a letter to Swift, written\r\n     many years later (March, 1737), Carteret writes: \"The people ask me\r\n     how I governed Ireland, I say that I pleased Dr. Swift.\" And Swift\r\n     confessed (in a letter to Gay, November 19th, 1730) that Carteret\r\n     \"had a genteeler manner of binding the chains of the kingdom than\r\n     most of his predecessors.\" It was to Carteret that Swift made his\r\n     well-known remark, on an occasion of a visit, \"What, in God's name,\r\n     do you do here? Get back to your own country, and send us our\r\n     boobies again.\"\r\n\r\n     Swift was well aware that Carteret had not the power to make the\r\n     changes in Ireland necessary for its well-being. Such changes could\r\n     come only from the government in England, and as this was\r\n     implacable, Carteret was but an instrument in its hands. Swift was\r\n     therefore compelled to rest content with obtaining what favours he\r\n     could for those friends of his who he knew deserved advancement,\r\n     and he allowed no occasion to slip by without soliciting in their\r\n     behalf.\r\n\r\n     Richard Tighe (who had managed to injure Sheridan in his\r\n     chaplaincy), with a number of the more violent members of the Whigs\r\n     in Ireland, took up Carteret's conduct, attempted, by means of\r\n     their interpretation of the Lord Lieutenant's promotions, to injure\r\n     him with the government, and accused him of advancing individuals\r\n     who were enemies of the government. Swift took up the charge in his\r\n     usual ironical manner, and wrote the Vindication which follows.\r\n\r\n     Carteret, it may be added here, was dismissed from his office in\r\n     1730, and joined Pulteney in a bitter struggle against Walpole,\r\n     which culminated in his famous resolution, presented to the House\r\n     of Lords, desiring that the King should remove Walpole from his\r\n     presence and counsels for ever. Carteret failed, but Walpole was\r\n     compelled to resign in 1742. The rest of Carteret's career bears no\r\n     relation to Irish affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The present text is founded on that of the original London edition\r\n     printed in 1730, collated with the Dublin edition of the same date.\r\n     They differ in many minor details from that given by Scott in 1824.\r\n\r\n     [T.

Too much distinguish'd, I confess, for\r\nwhat they acted, and what they suffer'd in defending the former\r\nConstitution in Church and State, under King Charles the Martyr; I mean\r\nthat very Prince, on account of whose martyrdom \"a Form of Prayer, with\r\nFasting,\" was enjoined, by Act of Parliament, \"to be used on the 30th\r\nday of January every year, to implore the mercies of God, that the guilt\r\nof that sacred and innocent blood, might not be visited on us or our\r\nposterity,\" as we may read at large in our Common Prayer Books. Which\r\nday hath been solemnly kept, even within the memory of many men now\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the present Lord, was educated in the University of\r\nOxford,[145] from whence, with a singularity scarce to be justified, he\r\ncarried away more Greek, Latin, and philosophy, than properly became a\r\nperson of his rank, indeed much more of each than most of those who are\r\nforced to live by their learning, will be at the unnecessary pains to\r\nload their heads with.\r\n\r\nThis was the rock he split on, upon his first appearance in the world,\r\nand just got clear of his guardians. For, as soon as he came to town,\r\nsome bishops, and clergymen, and other persons most eminent for learning\r\nand parts, got him among them, from whom though he were fortunately\r\ndragged by a lady and the Court, yet he could never wipe off the stain,\r\nnor wash out the tincture of his University acquirements and\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nTo this another misfortune was added; that it pleased God to endow him\r\nwith great natural talents, memory, judgment, comprehension, eloquence,\r\nand wit. And, to finish the work, all these were fortified even in his\r\nyouth, with the advantages received by such employments as are best\r\nfitted both to exercise and polish the gifts of nature and education;\r\nhaving been Ambassador in several Courts when his age would hardly allow\r\nhim to take a degree, and made principal Secretary of State, at a period\r\nwhen, according to custom, he ought to have been busied in losing his\r\nmoney at a chocolate-house, or in other amusements equally laudable and\r\nepidemic among persons of honour.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit another weak side in his Excellency, for it is known, and\r\ncan be proved upon him, that Greek and Latin books might be found every\r\nday in his dressing-room, if it were carefully searched; and there is\r\nreason to suspect, that some of the said books have been privately\r\nconveyed to him by Tory hands. I am likewise assured, that he hath been\r\ntaken in the very fact of reading the said books, even in the midst of a\r\nsession, to the great neglect of public affairs.[146]\r\n\r\nI own there may be some grounds for this charge, because I have it from\r\ngood hands, that when his Excellency is at dinner with one or two\r\nscholars at his elbows, he grows a most unsupportable, and\r\nunintelligible companion to all the fine gentlemen round the table.\r\n\r\nI cannot deny that his Excellency lies under another great disadvantage.\r\nFor, with all the accomplishments above-mentioned, adding that of a most\r\ncomely and graceful person, and during the prime of youth, spirits, and\r\nvigor, he hath in a most unexemplary manner led a regular domestic life,\r\ndiscovers a great esteem, and friendship, and love for his lady, as well\r\nas a true affection for his children; and when he is disposed to admit\r\nan entertaining evening companion, he doth not always enough reflect\r\nwhether the person may possibly in former days have lain under the\r\nimputation of a Tory; nor at such times do the natural or affected fears\r\nof Popery and the Pretender make any part of the conversation; I\r\npresume, because neither Homer, Plato, Aristotle, nor Cicero have made\r\nany mention of them.\r\n\r\nThese I freely acknowledge to be his Excellency's failings: Yet I think\r\nit is agreed by philosophers and divines, that some allowance ought to\r\nbe given to human infirmity, and the prejudices of a wrong education.\r\n\r\nI am well aware how much my sentiments differ from the orthodox opinion\r\nof one or two principal patriots, (at the head of whom I name with\r\nhonour Pistorides.[147]) For these have decided the matter directly\r\nagainst me, by declaring that no person who was ever known to lie under\r\nthe suspicion of one single Tory principle, or who had been once seen at\r\na great man's levee in the worst of times,[148] should be allowed to\r\ncome within the verge of the Castle; much less to bow in the\r\nantechamber, appear at the assemblies, or dance at a birth-night.\r\nHowever, I dare assert, that this maxim hath been often controlled, and\r\nthat on the contrary a considerable number of early penitents have been\r\nreceived into grace, who are now an ornament, happiness, and support to\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nNeither do I find any murmuring on some other points of greater\r\nimportance, where this favourite maxim is not so strictly observed.\r\n\r\nTo instance only in one. I have not heard that any care hath hitherto\r\nbeen taken to discover whether Madam Violante[149] be a Whig or Tory in\r\nher principles, or even that she hath ever been offered the oaths to the\r\nGovernment; on the contrary I am told that she openly professes herself\r\nto be a high-flyer, and it is not improbable, by her outlandish name she\r\nmay also be a Papist in her heart; yet we see this illustrious and\r\ndangerous female openly caressed by principal persons of both parties,\r\nwho contribute to support her in a splendid manner, without the least\r\napprehensions from a grand jury, or even from Squire Hartley Hutcheson\r\nhimself, that zealous prosecutor of hawkers and libels.[150] And as\r\nHobbes wisely observes, so much money being equivalent to so much power,\r\nit may deserve considering with what safety such an instrument of power\r\nought to be trusted in the hands of an alien, who hath not given any\r\nlegal security for her good affection to the government.\r\n\r\nI confess, there is one evil which I could wish our friends would think\r\nproper to redress. There are many Whigs in this Kingdom of the\r\nold-fashioned stamp, of whom we might make very good use; They bear the\r\nsame loyalty with us, to the Hanoverian family, in the person of King\r\nGeorge II.; the same abhorrence of the Pretender, with the consequent of\r\nPopery and slavery; and the same indulgence to tender consciences; but\r\nhaving nothing to ask for themselves, and consequently the more leisure\r\nto think for the public, they are often apt to entertain fears, and\r\nmelancholy prospects concerning the state of their country, the decay of\r\ntrade, the want of money, the miserable condition of the people, with\r\nother topics of like nature, all which do equally concern both Whig and\r\nTory, who if they have anything to lose must be equally sufferers.\r\nPerhaps one or two of these melancholy gentlemen will sometimes venture\r\nto publish their thoughts in print: Now I can by no means approve our\r\nusual custom of cursing and railing at this species of thinkers under\r\nthe names of Tories, Jacobites, Papists, libellers, rebels, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nThis was the utter ruin of that poor, angry, bustling, well-meaning\r\nmortal Pistorides, who lies equally under the contempt of both parties,\r\nwith no other difference than a mixture of pity on one side, and of\r\naversion on the other.\r\n\r\nHow hath he been pelted, pestered, and pounded by one single wag, who\r\npromiseth never to forsake him living or dead![151]\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with the humour of a surgeon in this town, who having\r\nin his own apprehension, received some great injustice from the Earl of\r\nGalway,[152] and despairing of revenge, as well as relief, declared to\r\nall his friends that he had set apart a hundred guineas to purchase the\r\nEarl's carcase from the sexton, whenever it should die; to make a\r\nskeleton of the bones, stuff the hide, and shew them for threepence; and\r\nthus get vengeance for the injuries he had suffered by the owner.\r\n\r\nOf the like spirit too often is that implacable race of wits, against\r\nwhom there is no defence but innocence, and philosophy: Neither of\r\nwhich is likely to be at hand; and therefore the wounded have nowhere to\r\nfly for a cure, but to downright stupidity, a crazed head, or a\r\nprofligate contempt of guilt and shame.\r\n\r\nI am therefore sorry for that other miserable creature Traulus,[153] who\r\nalthough of somewhat a different species, yet seems very far to outdo\r\neven the genius of Pistorides, in that miscarrying talent of railing\r\nwithout consistency or discretion, against the most innocent persons,\r\naccording to the present situation of his gall and spleen. I do not\r\nblame an _honest_ gentleman for the bitterest invectives against one to\r\nwhom he professeth the greatest friendship; provided he acts in the\r\ndark, so as not to be discovered. But in the midst of caresses, visits,\r\nand invitations, to run into the streets, or to as public a place, and\r\nwithout the least pretended excitement, sputter out the basest and\r\nfalsest accusations; then to wipe his mouth, come up smiling to his\r\nfriend, shake him by the hand, and tell him in a whisper, it was \"all\r\nfor his service;\" this proceeding, I am bold to think a great failure in\r\nprudence; and I am afraid lest such a practitioner, with a body so open,\r\nso foul, and so full of sores, may fall under the resentment of an\r\nincensed political surgeon, who is not in much renown for his mercy upon\r\ngreat provocation: who without waiting for his death, will flay, and\r\ndissect him alive, and to the view of mankind lay open all the\r\ndisordered cells of his brain, the venom of his tongue, the corruption\r\nof his heart, and spots and flatuses of his spleen--And all this for\r\nthreepence.[154]\r\n\r\nIn such a case what a scene would be laid open! and to drop my metaphor\r\nwhat a character of our mistaking friend might an angry enemy draw and\r\nexpose! particularizing that unnatural conjunction of vices and follies,\r\nso inconsistent with each other in the same breast: Furious and fawning,\r\nscurrilous and flattering, cowardly and provoking, insolent and abject;\r\nmost profligately false, with the strongest professions of sincerity,\r\npositive and variable, tyrannical and slavish.\r\n\r\nI apprehend that if all this should be set out to the world by an angry\r\nWhig of the old stamp, the unavoidable consequence must be a confinement\r\nof our friend for some months more to his garret, and thereby depriving\r\nthe public for so long a time, and in so important a juncture, of his\r\nuseful talents in their service, while he is fed like a wild beast\r\nthrough a hole; but I hope with a special regard to the quantity and\r\nquality of his nourishment.\r\n\r\nIn vain would his excusers endeavour to palliate his enormities, by\r\nimputing them to madness:[155] Because, it is well known, that madness\r\nonly operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil dispositions\r\nof the mind: For the curators of Bedlam assure us, that some lunatics\r\nare persons of honour, truth, benevolence, and many other virtues, which\r\nappear in their highest ravings, although after a wild incoherent\r\nmanner; while others on the contrary, discover in every word and action\r\nthe utmost baseness and depravity of human minds; which infallibly they\r\npossessed in the same degree, although perhaps under a better\r\nregulation, before their entrance into that academy.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected, that there is an argument of much force to\r\nexcuse the overflowings of that zeal, which our friend shews or means\r\nfor our cause. And it must be confessed, that the easy and smooth\r\nfluency of his elocution bestowed on him by nature, and cultivated by\r\ncontinual practice, added to the comeliness of his person, the harmony\r\nof his voice, the gracefulness of his manner, and the decency of his\r\ndress, are temptations too strong for such a genius to resist upon any\r\npublic occasion of making them appear with universal applause: And if\r\ngood men are sometimes accused of loving their jest better than their\r\nfriend, surely to gain the reputation of the first orator in the\r\nkingdom, no man of spirit would scruple to lose all the friends he had\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for masters to make their boys declaim on both sides of an\r\nargument; and as some kinds of assemblies are called the schools of\r\npolitics, I confess nothing can better improve political school-boys,\r\nthan the art of making plausible or implausible harangues, against the\r\nvery opinion for which they resolve to determine.\r\n\r\nSo Cardinal Perron after having spoke for an hour to the admiration of\r\nall his hearers, to prove the existence of God; told some of his\r\nintimates that he could have spoken another hour, and much better, to\r\nprove the contrary.\r\n\r\nI have placed this reasoning in the strongest light, that I think it\r\nwill bear; and have nothing to answer, but that allowing it as much\r\nweight as the reader shall please, it hath constantly met with ill\r\nsuccess in the mouth of our friend, whether for want of good luck, or\r\ngood management I suspend my judgment.\r\n\r\nTo return from this long digression. If persons in high stations have\r\nbeen allowed to choose mistresses, without regard even to difference in\r\nreligion, yet never incurred the least reflection on their loyalty or\r\ntheir Protestantism; shall the chief governor of a great kingdom be\r\ncensured for choosing a companion, who may formerly have been suspected\r\nfor differing from the orthodox in some speculative opinions of persons\r\nand things, which cannot affect the fundamental principles of a sound\r\nWhig?\r\n\r\nBut let me suppose a very possible case. Here is a person sent to govern\r\nIreland, whose unfortunate weak side it happens to be, for several\r\nreasons above-mentioned, that he hath encouraged the attendance of one or\r\ntwo gentlemen distinguished for their taste, their wit, and their\r\nlearning; who have taken the oaths to his Majesty, and pray heartily for\r\nhim: Yet because they may perhaps be stigmatized as _quondam_ Tories by\r\nPistorides and his gang; his Excellency must be forced to banish them\r\nunder the pain and peril of displeasing the zealots of his own party;\r\nand thereby be put into a worse condition than every common good-fellow;\r\nwho may be a sincere Protestant, and a loyal subject, and yet rather\r\nchoose to drink fine ale at the Pope's head, than muddy at the King's.\r\n\r\nLet me then return to my supposition. It is certain, the high-flown\r\nloyalists in the present sense of the word, have their thoughts, and\r\nstudies, and tongues so entirely diverted by political schemes, that\r\nthe zeal of their principles hath eaten up their understandings; neither\r\nhave they time from their employments, their hopes, and their hourly\r\nlabours for acquiring new additions of merit, to amuse themselves with\r\nphilological converse, or speculations which are utterly ruinous to all\r\nschemes of rising in the world: What must then a great man do whose ill\r\nstars have fatally perverted him to a love, and taste, and possession of\r\nliterature, politeness, and good sense? Our thorough-sped republic of\r\nWhigs, which contains the bulk of all hopers, pretenders, expecters and\r\nprofessors, are, beyond all doubt, most highly useful to princes, to\r\ngovernors, to great ministers, and to their country, but at the same\r\ntime, and by necessary consequence, the most disagreeable companions to\r\nall who have that unfortunate turn of mind peculiar to his Excellency,\r\nand perhaps to five or six more in a nation.\r\n\r\nI do not deny it possible, that an original or proselyte favourer of the\r\ntimes, might have been born to those useless talents which in former\r\nages qualified a man to be a poet, or a philosopher. All I contend for\r\nis, that where the true genius of party once enters, it sweeps the house\r\nclean, and leaves room for many other spirits to take joint possession,\r\ntill the last state of that man is exceedingly better than the first.\r\n\r\nI allow it a great error in his Excellency that he adheres so\r\nobstinately to his old unfashionable academic education: Yet so perverse\r\nis human nature, that the usual remedies for this evil in others, have\r\nproduced a contrary effect in him; to a degree, that I am credibly\r\ninformed, he will, as I have already hinted, in the middle of a session\r\nquote passages out of Plato, and Pindar at his own table to some\r\nbook-learned companion, without blushing, even when persons of great\r\nstations are by.\r\n\r\nI will venture one step further; which is, freely to confess, that this\r\nmistaken method of educating youth in the knowledge of ancient learning\r\nand language, is too apt to spoil their politics and principles; because\r\nthe doctrine and examples of the books they read, teach them lessons\r\ndirectly contrary in every point to the present practice of the world:\r\nAnd accordingly, Hobbes most judiciously observes, that the writings of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans made young men imbibe opinions against absolute\r\npower in a prince, or even in a first minister, and to embrace notions\r\nof liberty and property.\r\n\r\nIt hath been therefore a great felicity to these kingdoms, that the\r\nheirs to titles and large estates, have a weakness in their eyes, a\r\ntenderness in their constitutions, are not able to bear the pain and\r\nindignity of whipping; and as the mother rightly expresses it, could\r\nnever take to their book; yet are well enough qualified to sign a\r\nreceipt for half a year's rent, to put their names (_rightly spelt_) to\r\na warrant, and to read pamphlets against religion and high-flying;\r\nwhereby they fill their niches, and carry themselves through the world\r\nwith that dignity which best becomes a senator, and a squire.[156]\r\n\r\nI could heartily wish his Excellency would be more condescending to the\r\ngenius of the kingdom he governs, to the condition of the times, and to\r\nthe nature of the station he fills. Yet if it be true, what I have read\r\nin old English story-books, that one Agesilaus (no matter to the bulk of\r\nmy readers, whether I spell the names right or wrong) was caught by the\r\nparson of the parish, riding on a hobby-horse with his children; that\r\nSocrates a heathen philosopher, was found dancing by himself at\r\nfourscore; that a king called Cæsar Augustus (or some such name) used to\r\nplay with boys; whereof some might possibly be sons of Tories; and, that\r\ntwo great men called Scipio and Lælius, (I forget their Christian names,\r\nand whether they were poets or generals,) often played at duck and drake\r\nwith smooth stones on a river. Now I say, if these facts be true (and\r\nthe book where I found them is in print) I cannot imagine why our most\r\nzealous patriots may not a little indulge his Excellency, in an\r\ninfirmity which is not morally evil, provided he gives no public scandal\r\n(which is by all means to be avoided) I say, why he may not be indulged\r\ntwice a week to converse with one or two particular persons, and let him\r\nand them con over their old exploded readings together, after mornings\r\nspent in hearing and prescribing ways and means from and to his most\r\nobedient politicians, for the welfare of the kingdom; although the said\r\nparticular person or persons may not have made so public a declaration\r\nof their political faith in all its parts, as the business of the nation\r\nrequires. Still submitting my opinion to that happy majority, which I am\r\nconfident is always in the right; by whom the liberty of the subject\r\nhath been so frequently, so strenuously, and so successfully asserted;\r\nwho by their wise counsels have made commerce to flourish, money to\r\nabound, inhabitants to increase, the value of lands and rents to rise;\r\nand the whole island put on a new face of plenty and prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut in order to clear his Excellency, more fully from this accusation of\r\nshewing his favours to high-flyers, Tories, and Jacobites; it will be\r\nnecessary to come to particulars.\r\n\r\nThe first person of a Tory denomination to whom his Excellency gave any\r\nmarks of his favour, was Doctor Thomas Sheridan.[157] It is to be\r\nobserved, that this happened so early in his Excellency's government, as\r\nit may be justly supposed he had not been informed of that gentleman's\r\ncharacter upon so dangerous an article. The Doctor being well known and\r\ndistinguished, for his skill and success in the education of youth,\r\nbeyond most of his profession for many years past, was recommended to\r\nhis Excellency on the score of his learning, and particularly for his\r\nknowledge in the Greek tongue, whereof it seems his Excellency is a\r\ngreat admirer, although for what reasons I could never imagine. However\r\nit is agreed on all hands, that his lordship was too easily prevailed on\r\nby the Doctor's request, or indeed rather from the bias of his own\r\nnature, to hear a tragedy acted in that unknown language by the Doctor's\r\nlads,[158] which was written by some heathen author, but whether it\r\ncontained any Tory or High-Church principles, must be left to the\r\nconsciences of the boys, the Doctor, and his Excellency: The only\r\nwitnesses in this case, whose testimonies can be depended upon.\r\n\r\nIt seems, his Excellency (a thing never to be sufficiently wondered at)\r\nwas so pleased with his entertainment, that some time after he gave the\r\nDoctor a church living to the value of almost one hundred pounds a year,\r\nand made him one of his chaplains, from an antiquated notion, that good\r\nschoolmasters ought to be encouraged in every nation, professing\r\ncivility and religion. Yet his Excellency did not venture to make this\r\nbold step without strong recommendations from persons of undoubted\r\nprinciples, fitted to the times; who thought themselves bound in\r\njustice, honour, and gratitude, to do the Doctor a good office in return\r\nfor the care he had taken of their children, or those of their\r\nfriends.[159] Yet the catastrophe was terrible: For, the Doctor in the\r\nheight of his felicity and gratitude, going down to take possession of\r\nhis parish, and furnished with a few led-sermons, whereof as it is to be\r\nsupposed the number was very small, having never served a cure in the\r\nChurch; he stopped at Cork to attend on his bishop; and going to church\r\non the Sunday following, was according to the usual civility of country\r\nclergymen, invited by the minister of the parish to supply the pulpit.\r\nIt happened to be the first of August[160]; and the first of August\r\nhappened that year to light upon a Sunday: And it happened that the\r\nDoctor's text was in these words; \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil\r\nthereof;\" and lastly it happened, that some one person of the\r\ncongregation, whose loyalty made him watchful upon every appearance of\r\ndanger to his Majesty's person and Government, when service was over,\r\ngave the alarm. Notice was immediately sent up to town, and by the zeal\r\nof one man[161] of no large dimensions of body or mind, such a clamour\r\nwas raised, that we in Dublin could apprehend no less than an invasion\r\nby the Pretender, who must be landed in the South. The result was, that\r\nthe Doctor must be struck out of the chaplains' list, and appear no more\r\nat the Castle; yet, whether he were then, or be at this day, a Whig or a\r\nTory, I think is a secret; only it is manifest, that he is a zealous\r\nHanoverian, at least in poetry,[162] and a great adorer of the present\r\nRoyal Family through all its branches. His friends likewise assert, that\r\nhe had preached this same sermon often, under the same text; that not\r\nhaving observed the words till he was in the pulpit, and had opened his\r\nnotes; as he is a person a little abstracted, he wanted presence of mind\r\nto change them: And that in the whole sermon there was not a syllable\r\nrelating to Government or party, or to the subject of the day.\r\n\r\nIn this incident there seems to have been an union of events, that will\r\nprobably never happen again to the end of the world, or at least like\r\nthe grand conjunction in the heavens, which I think they say can arrive\r\nbut once in twenty thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe second gentleman (if I am right in my chronology) who under the\r\nsuspicion of a Tory, received some favour from his Excellency, is Mr.\r\nJames Stopford[163]; very strongly recommended by the most eminent Whig\r\nin England, on the account of his learning, and virtue, and other\r\naccomplishments. He had passed the greatest part of his youth in close\r\nstudy, or in travelling; and was neither not at home, or not at leisure\r\nto trouble his thoughts about party; which I allow to be a great\r\nomission; though I cannot honestly place him in the list of Tories, and\r\ntherefore think his Excellency may be fairly acquitted for making him\r\nVicar of Finglass, worth about one hundred and fifty pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe third is Doctor Patrick Delany.[164] This divine lies under some\r\ndisadvantage; having in his youth received many civilities from a\r\ncertain person then in a very high station here,[165] for which reason I\r\ndoubt the Doctor never drank his confusion since: And what makes the\r\nmatter desperate, it is now too late; unless our inquisitors will be\r\ncontent with drinking confusion to his memory. The aforesaid eminent\r\nperson who was a judge of all merit but party, distinguished the Doctor\r\namong other juniors in our University, for his learning, virtue,\r\ndiscretion, and good sense. But the Doctor was then in too good a\r\nsituation at his college, to hope or endeavour at a better\r\nestablishment, from one who had no power to give it him.\r\n\r\nUpon the present Lord-Lieutenant's coming over, the Doctor was named to\r\nhis Excellency by a friend,[166] among other clergy of distinction, as\r\npersons whose characters it was proper his Excellency should know: And\r\nby the truth of which the giver would be content to stand or fall in his\r\nExcellency's opinion; since not one of those persons were in particular\r\nfriendship with the gentleman who gave in their names. By this and some\r\nother incidents, particularly the recommendation of the late Archbishop\r\nof Dublin,[167] the Doctor became known to his Excellency; whose fatal\r\nturn of mind toward heathenish and outlandish books and languages,\r\nfinding, as I conceive a like disposition in the Doctor, was the cause\r\nof his becoming so domestic, as we are told he is, at the Castle of\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nThree or four years ago, the Doctor grown weary of an academic life,\r\nfor some reasons best known to the managers of the discipline in that\r\nlearned society (which it may not be for their honour to mention[168])\r\nresolved to leave it, although by the benefit of the pupils, and his\r\nsenior-fellowship with all its perquisites, he received every year\r\nbetween nine hundred and a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nAnd a small northern living, in the University's donation, of somewhat\r\nbetter than hundred pounds a year, falling at the same time with the\r\nChancellorship of Christ-Church, to about equal the value, in the gift\r\nof his Excellency, the Doctor ventured into the world in a very scanty\r\ncondition, having squandered away all his annual income in a manner,\r\nwhich although perhaps proper enough for a clergyman without a family,\r\nwill not be for the advantage of his character to discover either on the\r\nexchange, or at a banker's shop.\r\n\r\nAbout two months ago, his Excellency gave the Doctor a prebend in St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral; which being of near the same value with either of\r\nthe two former, will add a third part to his revenues, after he shall\r\nhave paid the great incumbrances upon it; so that he may now be said to\r\npossess of Church preferments in scattered tithes, three hundred pounds\r\na year, instead of the like sum of infallible rents from a senior\r\nfellowship with the offices annexed; beside the advantage of a free\r\nlodging, and some other easements.\r\n\r\nBut since the Doctor hath not in any of his writings, his sermons, his\r\nactions, his discourse, or his company, discovered one single principle\r\nof either Whig or Tory; and that the Lord Lieutenant still continues to\r\nadmit him; I shall boldly pronounce him _ONE OF US_: but like a new\r\nfree-mason, who hath not yet learned all the dialect of the mystery.\r\nNeither can he justly be accused of any Tory doctrines, except perhaps\r\nsome among those few, with which that wicked party was charged, during\r\nthe height of their power; but have been since transferred for the most\r\nsolid reasons, to the whole body of our firmest friends.\r\n\r\nI have now done with the clergy; And upon the strictest examination have\r\nnot been able to find above one of that order, against whom any party\r\nsuspicion can lie, which is the unfortunate gentleman, Doctor Sheridan,\r\nwho by mere chance-medley shot his own fortune dead with a single text.\r\n\r\nAs to the laity I can hear of but one person of the Tory stamp, who\r\nsince the beginning of his Excellency's government, did ever receive any\r\nsolid mark of his favour; I mean Sir Arthur Acheson,[169] reported to be\r\nan acknowledged Tory, and what is almost as bad, a scholar into the\r\nbargain. It is whispered about as a certain truth, that this gentleman\r\nis to have a grant of a certain barrack upon his estate, within two\r\nmiles of his own house; for which the Crown is to be his tenant, at the\r\nrent of sixty pounds _per annum_; he being only at the expense of about\r\nfive hundred pounds, to put the house in repair, build stables, and\r\nother necessaries. I will place this invidious mark of beneficence,\r\nconferred on a Tory, in a fair light, by computing the costs and\r\nnecessary defalcations; after which it may be seen how much Sir Arthur\r\nwill be annually a clear gainer by the public, notwithstanding his\r\nunfortunate principles, and his knowledge in Greek and Latin.\r\n\r\n  For repairs, &c. _500l._ the interest whereof _per ann._ 30 0 0\r\n  For all manner of poultry to furnish the troopers,\r\n    but which the said troopers must be at the\r\n    labour of catching, valued _per ann._                   5 0 0\r\n  For straggling sheep,                                     8 0 0\r\n  For game destroyed five miles round,                      6 0 0\r\n                                                          --------\r\n                                                           49 0 0\r\n\r\n  Rent paid to Sir Arthur,        60 0 0\r\n    Deduct                        49 0 0\r\n                                  ------\r\n    Remains clear,                11 0 0\r\n                                  ------\r\n\r\nThus, if Sir Arthur Acheson shall have the good fortune to obtain a\r\ngrant of this barrack, he will receive net profit annually from the\r\nCrown ELEVEN pounds sterling to help him in entertaining the officers,\r\nand making provisions for his younger children.\r\n\r\nIt is true, there is another advantage to be expected, which may fully\r\ncompensate the loss of cattle and poultry; by multiplying the breed of\r\nmankind, and particularly of good Protestants, in a part of the Kingdom\r\nhalf depopulated by the wild humour among the farmers there, of leaving\r\ntheir country. But I am not so skilful in arithmetic, as to compute the\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nI have reckoned one _per cent._ below the legal interest for the money\r\nthat Sir Arthur must expend, and valued the damage in the other articles\r\nvery moderately. However, I am confident he may with good management be\r\na saver at least; which is a prodigious instance of moderation in our\r\nfriends toward a professed Tory, whatever merit he may pretend by the\r\nunwillingness he hath shewn to make his Excellency uneasy in his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThus I have with the utmost impartiality collected every single favour,\r\n(further than personal civilities) conferred by his Excellency on\r\nTories, and reputed Tories, since his first arrival hither to this\r\npresent 13th day of April, in the year of our Lord 1730, giving all\r\nallowance possible to the arguments on the other side of the question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  And the account will stand thus.\r\n\r\nDisposed of preferments and employments to Tories, or reputed Tories, by\r\nhis Excellency the Lord Lieutenant in about the space of six years.\r\n\r\n  To Doctor Thomas Sheridan in a rectory near\r\n    Kinsale, _per ann._                            100 0 0\r\n  To Sir Arthur Acheson, Baronet, a barrack,\r\n    _per ann._                                      11 0 0\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n                                                   111 0 0\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n\r\nGive me leave now to compute in gross the value of the favours done by\r\nhis Excellency to the true friends of their King and Country, and of the\r\nProtestant religion.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, that although his Excellency cannot be properly\r\nsaid to bestow bishoprics, commands in the army, the place of a judge,\r\nor commissioner in the revenue, and some others; yet they are, for the\r\nmost part, disposed upon his recommendation, except where the persons\r\nare immediately sent from England by their interest at Court, for which\r\nI have allowed large defalcations in the following accounts. And it is\r\nremarkable that the only considerable station conferred on a reputed\r\nTory since his present Excellency's government was of this latter kind.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it is but too remarkable, that in a neighbouring nation,\r\n(where that dangerous denomination of men is incomparably more numerous,\r\nmore powerful, and of consequence more formidable) real Tories can often\r\nwith much less difficulty obtain very high favours from the Government,\r\nthan their reputed brethren can arrive to the lowest in ours. I observe\r\nthis with all possible submission to the wisdom of their policy, which,\r\nhowever, will not I believe, dispute the praise of vigilance with ours.\r\n\r\n                    WHIG Account.\r\n\r\n  To persons promoted to bishoprics, or removed\r\n    to more beneficial ones, computed\r\n    _per ann._                                    10050 0 0\r\n  To civil employments,                            9030 0 0\r\n  To military commands,                            8436 0 0\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n                                                  27516 0 0\r\n\r\n                   TORY Account.\r\n\r\n  To Tories                                         111 0 0\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n  Balance                                         27405 0 0\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n\r\nI shall conclude with this observation.

These tracts are entitled: \"On the Bill for the\r\n     Clergy's residing on their Livings,\" and \"Considerations upon two\r\n     Bills, sent down from the House of Lords and the House of Commons\r\n     in Ireland relating to the Clergy of Ireland\" (pp. 249-272). The\r\n     bills which Swift argued against were evidently intended to give\r\n     the bishops further powers and increased opportunities for making\r\n     money. (The matter is gone into at length in the notes prefixed to\r\n     the above reprints.) The bishops sought rights which would enable\r\n     them to obtain large powers in letting leases, and their eagerness\r\n     to get such powers, coupled with the efforts they expended, showed\r\n     that they had less regard for the Church's interest than for their\r\n     own.\r\n\r\n     In the present tract Swift, with his usual assumption of grave\r\n     consideration of an important question, but in reality with cutting\r\n     irony, proposes to dispose of all the Church lands for a lump sum,\r\n     give the bishops their full just share, including the amount of\r\n     fines for possible renewals of leases, and, at the same time, pay\r\n     off the national debt with the money that remains. With an air of\r\n     strict seriousness he solemnly computes the exact sums obtainable,\r\n     and impartially divides the amounts with accurate care. Then, with\r\n     a dig at the strangers England was continually sending to Irish\r\n     preferments, among whom he counts himself, he concludes by saying\r\n     that although the interests of such cannot be expected to be those\r\n     of the country to which they have been translated, yet he, as one\r\n     of them, is quite willing, and indeed feels himself in duty bound\r\n     \"to consult the interest of people among whom I have been so well\r\n     received. And if I can be any way instrumental toward contributing\r\n     to reduce this excellent proposal into a law ... my sincere\r\n     endeavours to serve this Church and kingdom will be rewarded.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of this pamphlet is based on that given at the end of the\r\n     volume containing the first edition of \"Considerations upon two\r\n     Bills,\" etc., published in 1732.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL FOR AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT, TO PAY OFF THE DEBT OF THE NATION,\r\nWITHOUT TAXING THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debts contracted some years past for the service and safety of the\r\nnation, are grown so great, that under our present distressed condition\r\nby the want of trade, the great remittances to pay absentees, regiments\r\nserving abroad, and many other drains of money, well enough known and\r\nfelt; the kingdom seems altogether unable to discharge them by the\r\ncommon methods of payment: And either a poll or land tax would be too\r\nodious to think of, especially the latter, because the lands, which have\r\nbeen let for these ten or dozen years past, were raised so high, that\r\nthe owners can, at present, hardly receive any rent at all. For, it is\r\nthe usual practice of an Irish tenant, rather than want land, to offer\r\nmore for a farm than he knows he can be ever able to pay, and in that\r\ncase he grows desperate, and pays nothing at all. So that a land-tax\r\nupon a racked estate would be a burthen wholly insupportable.\r\n\r\nThe question will then be, how these national debts can be paid, and how\r\nI can make good the several particulars of my proposal, which I shall\r\nnow lay open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of their Graces and Lordships the Archbishops and Bishops\r\nof this kingdom (excluding the fines) do amount by a moderate\r\ncomputation to _36,800l._ _per ann._ I mean the rents which the\r\nbishops receive from their tenants. But the real value of those lands\r\nat a full rent, taking the several sees one with another, is reckoned\r\nto be at least three-fourths more, so that multiplying _36,800l._ by\r\nfour, the full rent of all the bishops' lands will amount to\r\n_147,200l._ _per ann._ from which subtracting the present rent\r\nreceived by their lordships, that is _36,800l._ the profits of the\r\nlands received by the first and second tenants (who both have great\r\nbargains) will rise to the sum of _110,400l._ _per ann._ which lands,\r\nif they were to be sold at twenty-two years' purchase, would raise a\r\nsum of _2,428,800l._ reserving to the Bishops their present rents,\r\nonly excluding fines.[171]\r\n\r\nOf this sum I propose, that out of the one-half which amounts to\r\n_1,214,400l._ so much be applied as will entirely discharge the debts of\r\nthe nation, and the remainder laid up in the treasury, to supply\r\ncontingencies, as well as to discharge some of our heavy taxes, until\r\nthe kingdom shall be in a better condition.\r\n\r\nBut whereas the present set of bishops would be great losers by this\r\nscheme for want of their fines, which would be hard treatment to such\r\nreligious, loyal and deserving personages, I have therefore set apart\r\nthe other half to supply that defect, which it will more than\r\nsufficiently do.\r\n\r\nA bishop's lease for the full term, is reckoned to be worth eleven\r\nyears' purchase, but if we take the bishops round, I suppose, there may\r\nbe four years of each lease elapsed, and many of the bishops being well\r\nstricken in years, I cannot think their lives round to be worth more\r\nthan seven years' purchase; so that the purchasers may very well afford\r\nfifteen years' purchase for the reversion, especially by one great\r\nadditional advantage, which I shall soon mention.\r\n\r\nThis sum of _2,428,800l._ must likewise be sunk very considerably,\r\nbecause the lands are to be sold only at fifteen years' purchase, and\r\nthis lessens the sum to about _1,656,000l._ of which I propose twelve\r\nhundred thousand pounds to be applied partly for the payment of the\r\nnational debt, and partly as a fund for future exigencies, and the\r\nremaining _456,000l._ I propose as a fund for paying the present set of\r\nbishops their fines, which it will abundantly do, and a great part\r\nremain as an addition to the public stock.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bishops round do not in reality receive three fines\r\na-piece, which take up 21 years, yet I allow it to be so; but then I\r\nwill suppose them to take but one year's rent, in recompense of giving\r\nthem so large a term of life, and thus multiplying _36,800l._ by 3 the\r\nproduct will be only _110,400l._ so that above three-fourths will remain\r\nto be applied to public use.\r\n\r\nIf I have made wrong computations, I hope to be excused, as a stranger\r\nto the kingdom, which I never saw till I was called to an employment,\r\nand yet where I intend to pass the rest of my days; but I took care to\r\nget the best information I could, and from the most proper persons;\r\nhowever, the mistakes I may have been guilty of, will very little affect\r\nthe main of my proposal, although they should cause a difference of one\r\nhundred thousand pounds more or less.\r\n\r\nThese fines, are only to be paid to the bishop during his incumbency in\r\nthe same see; if he changeth it for a better, the purchasers of the\r\nvacant see lands, are to come immediately into possession of the see he\r\nhath left, and both the bishop who is removed, and he who comes into his\r\nplace, are to have no more fines, for the removed bishop will find his\r\naccount by a larger revenue; and the other see will find candidates\r\nenough. For the law maxim will here have place, that _caveat_, &c. I\r\nmean the persons who succeed may choose whether they will accept or no.\r\n\r\nAs to the purchasers, they will probably be tenants to the see, who are\r\nalready in possession, and can afford to give more than any other\r\nbidders.\r\n\r\nI will further explain myself. If a person already a bishop, be removed\r\ninto a richer see, he must be content with the bare revenues, without\r\nany fines, and so must he who comes into a bishopric vacant by death:\r\nAnd this will bring the matter sooner to bear; which if the Crown shall\r\nthink fit to countenance, will soon change the present set of bishops,\r\nand consequently encourage purchasers of their lands. For example, If a\r\nPrimate should die, and the gradation be wisely made, almost the whole\r\nset of bishops might be changed in a month, each to his great advantage,\r\nalthough no fines were to be got, and thereby save a great part of that\r\nsum which I have appropriated towards supplying the deficiency of fines.\r\n\r\nI have valued the bishops' lands two years' purchase above the usual\r\ncomputed rate, because those lands will have a sanction from the King\r\nand Council in England, and be confirmed by an Act of Parliament here;\r\nbesides, it is well known, that higher prices are given every day, for\r\nworse lands, at the remotest distances, and at rack rents, which I take\r\nto be occasioned by want of trade, when there are few borrowers, and the\r\nlittle money in private hands lying dead, there is no other way to\r\ndispose of it but in buying of land, which consequently makes the owners\r\nhold it so high.\r\n\r\nBesides paying the nation's debts, the sale of these lands would have\r\nmany other good effects upon the nation; it will considerably increase\r\nthe number of gentry, where the bishops' tenants are not able or willing\r\nto purchase; for the lands will afford an hundred gentlemen a good\r\nrevenue to each; several persons from England will probably be glad to\r\ncome over hither, and be the buyers, rather than give thirty years'\r\npurchase at home, under the loads of taxes for the public and the poor,\r\nas well as repairs, by which means much money may be brought among us,\r\nand probably some of the purchasers themselves may be content to live\r\ncheap in a worse country, rather than be at the charge of exchange and\r\nagencies, and perhaps of non-solvencies in absence, if they let their\r\nlands too high.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will also multiply farmers, when the purchasers will have\r\nlands in their own power, to give long and easy leases to industrious\r\nhusbandmen.\r\n\r\nI have allowed some bishoprics of equal income to be of more or less\r\nvalue to the purchaser, according as they are circumstanced. For\r\ninstance, The lands of the primacy and some other sees, are let so low,\r\nthat they hardly pay a fifth penny of the real value to the bishop, and\r\nthere the fines are the greater. On the contrary, the sees of Meath and\r\nClonfert, consisting, as I am told, much of tithes, those tithes are\r\nannually let to the tenants without any fines. So the see of Dublin is\r\nsaid to have many fee-farms which pay no fines, and some leases for\r\nlives which pay very little, and not so soon nor so duly.\r\n\r\nI cannot but be confident, that their Graces my Lords the Archbishops,\r\nand my Lords the Bishops will heartily join in this proposal, out of\r\ngratitude to his late and present Majesty, the best of Kings, who have\r\nbestowed such high and opulent stations, as well as in pity to this\r\ncountry which is now become their own; whereby they will be instrumental\r\ntowards paying the nation's debts, without impoverishing themselves,\r\nenrich an hundred gentlemen, as well as free them from dependence, and\r\nthus remove that envy which is apt to fall upon their Graces and\r\nLordships from considerable persons, whose birth and fortunes rather\r\nqualify them to be lords of manors, than servile dependants upon\r\nChurchmen however dignified or distinguished.\r\n\r\nIf I do not flatter myself, there could not be any law more popular than\r\nthis; for the immediate tenants to bishops, being some of them persons\r\nof quality, and good estates, and more of them grown up to be gentlemen\r\nby the profits of these very leases, under a succession of bishops,\r\nthink it a disgrace to be subject both to rents and fines, at the\r\npleasure of their landlords. Then the bulk of the tenants, especially\r\nthe dissenters, who are our loyal Protestant brethren, look upon it both\r\nas an unnatural and iniquitous thing that bishops should be owners of\r\nland at all; (wherein I beg to differ from them) being a point so\r\ncontrary to the practice of the Apostles, whose successors they are\r\ndeemed to be, and who although they were contented that land should be\r\nsold, for the common use of the brethren, yet would not buy it\r\nthemselves, but had it laid at their feet, to be distributed to poor\r\nproselytes.\r\n\r\nI will add one word more, that by such a wholesome law, all the\r\noppressions felt by under-tenants of Church leases, which are now laid\r\non by the bishops would entirely be prevented, by their Graces and\r\nLordships consenting to have their lands sold for payment of the\r\nnation's debts, reserving only the present rent for their own plentiful\r\nand honourable support.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to add one particular, that, when heads of a Bill (as I find\r\nthe style runs in this kingdom) shall be brought in for forming this\r\nproposal into a law; I should humbly offer that there might be a power\r\ngiven to every bishop (except those who reside in Dublin) for applying\r\none hundred acres of profitable land that lies nearest to his palace, as\r\na demesne for the conveniency of his family.\r\n\r\nI know very well, that this scheme hath been much talked of for some\r\ntime past, and is in the thoughts of many patriots, neither was it\r\nproperly mine, although I fell readily into it, when it was first\r\ncommunicated to me.\r\n\r\nThough I am almost a perfect stranger in this kingdom, yet since I have\r\naccepted an employment here, of some consequence as well as profit, I\r\ncannot but think myself in duty bound to consult the interest of a\r\npeople, among whom I have been so well received. And if I can be any way\r\ninstrumental towards contributing to reduce this excellent proposal into\r\na law which being not in the least injurious to England, will, I am\r\nconfident, meet with no opposition from that side, my sincere endeavours\r\nto serve this Church and kingdom will be well rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE SUBMITTED BY DEAN SWIFT TO MR. LINDSAY, COUNSELLOR AT LAW.[172]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. B. agent for J. S. comes to desire J. S. to sign an assignment of a\r\nlease in order to be registered for the security of _38l._ J. S. asks\r\nA. B. to show him the lease A. B. says he left it at home. J. S. asks the\r\nsaid A. B. how many years of the lease are unexpired? what rent the\r\ntenant pays, and how much below the rack value? and what number of acres\r\nthere are upon the farm? To each of which questions the agent A. B.\r\nanswers categorically, that he cannot tell, and that he did not think J.\r\nwould ask him such questions. The said A. B. was asked how he came two\r\nyears after the lease was assigned, and not sooner, to have it\r\nregistered. A. B. answers, that he could not sue till the assignment.\r\n\r\nQuery, Whether the said agent A. B. made any one answer like a man of\r\nbusiness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nCERTAIN ABUSES, CORRUPTIONS, AND ENORMITIES\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF DUBLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Like many of Swift's satirical writings the title of this tract is\r\n     no indication to its subject-matter. Whatever \"abuses, corruptions\r\n     and enormities\" may have been rife in the city of Dublin in Swift's\r\n     time, the pamphlet which follows certainly throws no light on them.\r\n     It is in no sense a social document. But it is a very amusing and\r\n     excellent piece of jeering at the fancied apprehensions that were\r\n     rife about the Pretender, the \"disaffected\" people, and the\r\n     Jacobites. It is aimed at the Whigs, who were continually using the\r\n     party cries of \"No Popery,\" \"Jacobitism,\" and the other cognate\r\n     expressions to distress their political opponents. At the same\r\n     time, these cries had their effects, and created a great deal of\r\n     mischief. The Roman Catholics, in particular, were cruelly treated\r\n     because of the anxiety for the Protestant succession, and among the\r\n     lower tradesmen, for whom such cries would be of serious meaning, a\r\n     petty persecution against their Roman Catholic fellow-tradesmen\r\n     continually prevailed. Monck Mason draws attention to some curious\r\n     instances. (See his \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" p. 399,\r\n     note y.)\r\n\r\n     In the \"Journals of the Irish House of Commons\" (vol. ii., p. 77)\r\n     is the record of a petition presented in the year 1695, by the\r\n     Protestant porters of the city of Dublin, against one Darby Ryan,\r\n     \"a papist and notoriously disaffected.\" This Ryan was complained of\r\n     for employing those of his own persuasion and affection to carry a\r\n     cargo of coals he had bought, to his own customers. The petitioners\r\n     complained that they, Protestants, were \"debased and hindered from\r\n     their small trade and gains.\" Another set of petitioners was the\r\n     drivers of hackney coaches. They complained that, \"before the late\r\n     trouble, they got a livelihood by driving coaches in and about the\r\n     city of Dublin, but since that time, so many papists had got\r\n     coaches, and drove them with such ordinary horses, that the\r\n     petitioners could hardly get bread.... They therefore prayed the\r\n     house that none but Protestant hackney-coachmen may have liberty to\r\n     keep and drive hackney-coaches.\" Swift may have had these instances\r\n     in his mind when he urges that the criers who cry their wares in\r\n     Dublin should be True Protestants, and should give security to the\r\n     government for permission to cry.\r\n\r\n     In a country where such absurd complaints could be seriously\r\n     presented, and as seriously considered, a genuine apprehension must\r\n     have existed. The Whigs in making capital out of this existing\r\n     feeling stigmatized their Tory opponents as High Churchmen, and\r\n     therefore very little removed from Papists, and therefore\r\n     Jacobites. Of course there were no real grounds for such epithets,\r\n     but they indulged in them nevertheless, with the addition of\r\n     insinuations and suggestions--no insinuation being too feeble or\r\n     too far-fetched so long as it served.\r\n\r\n     Swift, writing in the person of a Whig, affects extreme anxiety for\r\n     the most ridiculous of signs, and finds a Papist, or a Jacobite,\r\n     or a disaffected person, in the least likely of places. The tract,\r\n     in this light, is a really amusing piece. Swift takes the\r\n     opportunity also to hit Walpole, under a pretended censure of his\r\n     extravagance, corruption, and avarice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text here given of this tract is based on that of the original\r\n     edition issued in Dublin in 1732. The last paragraph, however, does\r\n     not appear in that edition, and is reprinted here from Scott.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION\r\n\r\nOF CERTAIN\r\n\r\n_Abuses, Corruptions,_\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\n_ENORMITIES_\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nCity of _DUBLIN_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Dublin_: Printed in the Year 1732.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is held more commendable in all great cities, especially the\r\nmetropolis of a kingdom, than what the French call the police; by which\r\nword is meant the government thereof, to prevent the many disorders\r\noccasioned by great numbers of people and carriages, especially through\r\nnarrow streets. In this government our famous City of Dublin is said to\r\nbe very defective, and universally complained of. Many wholesome laws\r\nhave been enacted to correct those abuses, but are ill executed; and\r\nmany more are wanting, which I hope the united wisdom of the nation\r\n(whereof so many good effects have already appeared this session) will\r\nsoon take into their most profound consideration.\r\n\r\nAs I have been always watchful over the good of mine own country, and\r\nparticularly for that of our renowned city, where (_absit invidia_) I\r\nhad the honour to draw my first breath[173]; I cannot have a minute's\r\nease or patience to forbear enumerating some of the greatest enormities,\r\nabuses, and corruptions, spread almost through every part of Dublin; and\r\nproposing such remedies as, I hope, the legislature will approve of.\r\n\r\nThe narrow compass to which I have confined myself in this paper, will\r\nallow me only to touch at the most important defects, and such as I\r\nthink seem to require the most speedy redress.\r\n\r\nAnd first, perhaps there was never known a wiser institution than that\r\nof allowing certain persons of both sexes, in large and populous cities,\r\nto cry through the streets many necessaries of life; it would be endless\r\nto recount the conveniences which our city enjoys by this useful\r\ninvention, and particularly strangers, forced hither by business, who\r\nreside here but a short time; for, these having usually but little\r\nmoney, and being wholly ignorant of the town, might at an easy price\r\npurchase a tolerable dinner, if the several criers would pronounce the\r\nnames of the goods they have to sell, in any tolerable language. And\r\ntherefore till our law-makers shall think it proper to interpose so far\r\nas to make these traders pronounce their words in such terms, that a\r\nplain Christian hearer may comprehend what is cried, I would advise all\r\nnew comers to look out at their garret windows, and there see whether\r\nthe thing that is cried be tripes or flummery, butter-milk or cow-heels.\r\nFor, as things are now managed, how is it possible for an honest\r\ncountryman, just arrived, to find out what is meant, for instance, by\r\nthe following words, with which his ears are constantly stunned twice a\r\nday, \"Mugs, jugs and porringers, up in the garret, and down in the\r\ncellar.\" I say, how is it possible for any stranger to understand that\r\nthis jargon is meant as an invitation to buy a farthing's worth of milk\r\nfor his breakfast or supper, unless his curiosity draws him to the\r\nwindow, or till his landlady shall inform him. I produce this only as\r\none instance, among a hundred much worse, I mean where the words make a\r\nsound wholly inarticulate, which give so much disturbance, and so little\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe affirmation solemnly made in the cry of herrings, is directly\r\nagainst all truth and probability, \"Herrings alive, alive here.\" The\r\nvery proverb will convince us of this; for what is more frequent in\r\nordinary speech, than to say of some neighbour for whom the passing-bell\r\nrings, that he is dead as a herring. And, pray how is it possible, that\r\na herring, which as philosophers observe, cannot live longer than one\r\nminute, three seconds and a half out of water, should bear a voyage in\r\nopen boats from Howth to Dublin, be tossed into twenty hands, and\r\npreserve its life in sieves for several hours. Nay, we have witnesses\r\nready to produce, that many thousands of these herrings, so impudently\r\nasserted to be alive, have been a day and a night upon dry land. But\r\nthis is not the worst. What can we think of those impious wretches, who\r\ndare in the face of the sun, vouch the very same affirmative of their\r\nsalmon, and cry, \"Salmon alive, alive;\" whereas, if you call the woman\r\nwho cries it, she is not ashamed to turn back her mantle, and shew you\r\nthis individual salmon cut into a dozen pieces. I have given good advice\r\nto these infamous disgracers of their sex and calling, without the least\r\nappearance of remorse, and fully against the conviction of their own\r\nconsciences. I have mentioned this grievance to several of our parish\r\nministers, but all in vain; so that it must continue until the\r\ngovernment shall think fit to interpose.\r\n\r\nThere is another cry, which, from the strictest observation I can make,\r\nappears to be very modern, and it is that of sweethearts,[174] and is\r\nplainly intended for a reflection upon the female sex, as if there were\r\nat present so great a dearth of lovers, that the women instead of\r\nreceiving presents from men, were now forced to offer money, to purchase\r\nsweethearts. Neither am I sure, that the cry doth not glance at some\r\ndisaffection against the government; insinuating, that while so many of\r\nour troops are engaged in foreign service, and such a great number of\r\nour gallant officers constantly reside in England, the ladies are forced\r\nto take up with parsons and attorneys: But, this is a most unjust\r\nreflection, as may soon be proved by any person who frequents the\r\nCastle, our public walks, our balls and assemblies, where the crowds of\r\n_toupees_[175] were never known to swarm as they do at present.\r\n\r\nThere is a cry, peculiar to this City, which I do not remember to have\r\nbeen used in London, or at least, not in the same terms that it has been\r\npractised by both parties, during each of their power; but, very\r\nunjustly by the Tories. While these were at the helm, they grew daily\r\nmore and more impatient to put all true Whigs and Hanoverians out of\r\nemployments. To effect which, they hired certain ordinary fellows, with\r\nlarge baskets on their shoulders, to call aloud at every house, \"Dirt to\r\ncarry out;\" giving that denomination to our whole party, as if they\r\nwould signify, that the kingdom could never be cleansed, till we were\r\nswept from the earth like rubbish. But, since that happy turn of times,\r\nwhen we were so miraculously preserved by just an inch, from Popery,\r\nslavery, massacre, and the Pretender, I must own it prudence in us,\r\nstill to go on with the same cry, which hath ever since been so\r\neffectually observed, that the true political dirt is wholly removed,\r\nand thrown on its proper dunghills, there to corrupt, and be no more\r\nheard of.\r\n\r\nBut, to proceed to other enormities: Every person who walks the streets,\r\nmust needs observe the immense number of human excrements at the doors\r\nand steps of waste houses, and at the sides of every dead wall; for\r\nwhich the disaffected party have assigned a very false and malicious\r\ncause. They would have it, that these heaps were laid there privately by\r\nBritish fundaments, to make the world believe, that our Irish vulgar do\r\ndaily eat and drink; and, consequently, that the clamour of poverty\r\namong us, must be false, proceeding only from Jacobites and Papists.\r\nThey would confirm this, by pretending to observe, that a British anus\r\nbeing more narrowly perforated than one of our own country; and many of\r\nthese excrements upon a strict view appearing copple crowned, with a\r\npoint like a cone or pyramid, are easily distinguished from the\r\nHibernian, which lie much flatter, and with lest continuity. I\r\ncommunicated this conjecture to an eminent physician, who is well versed\r\nin such profound speculations; and at my request was pleased to make\r\ntrial with each of his fingers, by thrusting them into the anus of\r\nseveral persons of both nations, and professed he could find no such\r\ndifference between them as those ill-disposed people allege. On the\r\ncontrary, he assured me, that much the greater number of narrow cavities\r\nwere of Hibernian origin. This I only mention to shew how ready the\r\nJacobites are to lay hold of any handle to express their malice against\r\nthe government. I had almost forgot to add, that my friend the physician\r\ncould, by smelling each finger, distinguish the Hibernian excrement from\r\nthe British, and was not above twice mistaken in an hundred experiments;\r\nupon which he intends very soon to publish a learned dissertation.\r\n\r\nThere is a diversion in this City, which usually begins among the\r\nbutchers, but is often continued by a succession of other people,\r\nthrough many streets. It is called the COSSING of a dog; and I may\r\njustly number it among our corruptions. The ceremony is this: A strange\r\ndog happens to pass through a flesh-market; whereupon an expert butcher\r\nimmediately cries in a loud voice, and the proper tone, \"Coss, coss,\"\r\nseveral times: The same word is repeated by the people. The dog, who\r\nperfectly understands the terms of art, and consequently the danger he\r\nis in, immediately flies. The people, and even his own brother animals\r\npursue; the pursuit and cry attend him perhaps half a mile; he is well\r\nworried in his flight, and sometimes hardly escapes. This, our\r\nill-wishers of the Jacobite kind, are pleased to call a persecution; and\r\naffirm, that it always falls upon dogs of the Tory principle. But, we\r\ncan well defend ourselves, by justly alleging that when they were\r\nuppermost, they treated our dogs full as inhumanly: As to my own part,\r\nwho have in former times often attended these processions, although I\r\ncan very well distinguish between a Whig and Tory dog, yet I never\r\ncarried my resentments very far upon a party principle, except it were\r\nagainst certain malicious dogs, who most discovered their malice against\r\nus in the _worst of times_.[176] And, I remember too well, that in the\r\nwicked ministry of the Earl of Oxford, a large mastiff of our party\r\nbeing unmercifully cossed, ran, without thinking, between my legs, as I\r\nwas coming up Fishamble Street; and, as I am of low stature, with very\r\nshort legs, bore me riding backwards down the hill, for above two\r\nhundred yards: And, although I made use of his tail for a bridle,\r\nholding it fast with both my hands, and clung my legs as close to his\r\nsides as I could, yet we both came down together into the middle of the\r\nkennel; where after rolling three or four times over each other, I got\r\nup with much ado, amid the shouts and huzzas of a thousand malicious\r\nJacobites: I cannot, indeed, but gratefully acknowledge, that for this\r\nand many other services and sufferings, I have been since more than\r\nover-paid.\r\n\r\nThis adventure may, perhaps, have put me out of love with the diversions\r\nof cossing, which I confess myself an enemy to, unless we could always\r\nbe sure of distinguishing Tory dogs; whereof great numbers have since\r\nbeen so prudent, as entirely to change their principles, and are now\r\njustly esteemed the best worriers of their former friends.\r\n\r\nI am assured, and partly know, that all the chimney-sweepers' boys,\r\nwhere Members of Parliament chiefly lodge, are hired by our enemies to\r\nskulk in the tops of chimneys, with their heads no higher than will just\r\npermit them to look round; and at the usual hours when members are going\r\nto the House, if they see a coach stand near the lodging of any loyal\r\nmember, they call \"Coach, coach,\" as loud as they can bawl, just at the\r\ninstant when the footman begins to give the same call. And this is\r\nchiefly done on those days, when any point of importance is to be\r\ndebated. This practice may be of very dangerous consequence. For, these\r\nboys are all hired by enemies to the government; and thus, by the\r\nabsence of a few members for a few minutes, a question may be carried\r\nagainst the true interest of the kingdom, and very probably, not without\r\nany eye toward the Pretender.\r\n\r\nI have not observed the wit and fancy of this town, so much employed in\r\nany one article, as that of contriving variety of signs to hang over\r\nhouses, where punch is to be sold. The bowl is represented full of\r\npunch, the ladle stands erect in the middle, supported sometimes by one,\r\nand sometimes by two animals, whose feet rest upon the edge of the bowl.\r\nThese animals are sometimes one black lion, and sometimes a couple;\r\nsometimes a single eagle, and sometimes a spread one, and we often meet\r\na crow, a swan, a bear, or a cock, in the same posture.\r\n\r\nNow, I cannot find how any of these animals, either separate, or in\r\nconjunction, are properly speaking, either fit emblems or\r\nembellishments, to advance the sale of punch. Besides, it is agreed\r\namong naturalists, that no brute can endure the taste of strong liquor,\r\nexcept where he hath been used to it from his infancy: And,\r\nconsequently, it is against all the rules of hieroglyph, to assign those\r\nanimals as patrons, or protectors of punch. For, in that case, we ought\r\nto suppose, that the host keeps always ready the real bird, or beast,\r\nwhereof the picture hangs over his door, to entertain his guest; which,\r\nhowever, to my knowledge, is not true in fact. For not one of those\r\nbirds is a proper companion for a Christian, as to aiding and assisting\r\nin making the punch. For the birds, as they are drawn upon the sign, are\r\nmuch more likely to mute, or shed their feathers into the liquor. Then,\r\nas to the bear, he is too terrible, awkward, and slovenly a companion to\r\nconverse with; neither are any of them at all, handy enough to fill\r\nliquor to the company: I do, therefore, vehemently suspect a plot\r\nintended against the Government, by these devices. For, although the\r\nspread-eagle be the arms of Germany, upon which account it may possibly\r\nbe a lawful Protestant sign; yet I, who am very suspicious of fair\r\noutsides, in a matter which so nearly concerns our welfare, cannot but\r\ncall to mind, that the Pretender's wife is said to be of German birth:\r\nAnd that many Popish Princes, in so vast an extent of land, are reported\r\nto excel both at making and drinking punch. Besides, it is plain, that\r\nthe spread-eagle exhibits to us the perfect figure of a cross, which is\r\na badge of Popery. Then, as to the cock, he is well known to represent\r\nthe French nation, our old and dangerous enemy. The swan, who must of\r\nnecessity cover the entire bowl with his wings, can be no other than the\r\nSpaniard, who endeavours to engross all the treasures of the Indies to\r\nhimself. The lion is indeed, the common emblem of Royal power, as well\r\nas the arms of England; but to paint him black, is perfect Jacobitism,\r\nand a manifest type of those who blacken the actions of the best\r\nPrinces. It is not easy to distinguish, whether the other fowl painted\r\nover the punch-bowl, be a crow or raven? It is true, they have both been\r\nheld ominous birds; but I rather take it to be the former; because it is\r\nthe disposition of a crow, to pick out the eyes of other creatures; and\r\noften even of Christians, after they are dead; and is therefore drawn\r\nhere, with a design to put the Jacobites in mind of their old practice,\r\nfirst to lull us asleep, (which is an emblem of Death) and then to blind\r\nour eyes, that we may not see their dangerous practices against the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nTo speak my private opinion, the least offensive picture in the whole\r\nset, seems to be the bear; because he represents _ursa major_, or the\r\nGreat Bear, who presides over the North, where the Reformation first\r\nbegan, and which, next to Britain, (including Scotland and the north of\r\nIreland) is the great protector of the Protestant religion. But,\r\nhowever, in those signs where I observe the bear to be chained, I can't\r\nhelp surmising a Jacobite contrivance, by which these traitors hint an\r\nearnest desire of using all true Whigs, as the predecessors did the\r\nprimitive Christians; I mean, to represent us as bears, and then halloo\r\ntheir Tory dogs to bait us to death.\r\n\r\nThus I have given a fair account of what I dislike, in all those signs\r\nset over those houses that invite us to punch: I own it was a matter\r\nthat did not need explaining, being so very obvious to the most common\r\nunderstanding. Yet, I know not how it happens, but methinks there seems\r\na fatal blindness, to overspread our corporeal eyes, as well as our\r\nintellectual; and I heartily wish, I may be found a false prophet; for,\r\nthese are not bare suspicions, but manifest demonstrations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, away with those Popish, Jacobite, and idolatrous gew-gaws.\r\nAnd I heartily wish a law were enacted, under severe penalties, against\r\ndrinking any punch at all. For nothing is easier, than to prove it a\r\ndisaffected liquor. The chief ingredients, which are brandy, oranges,\r\nand lemons, are all sent us from Popish countries; and nothing remains\r\nof Protestant growth but sugar and water. For, as to biscuit, which\r\nformerly was held a necessary ingredient, and is truly British, we find\r\nit is entirely rejected.\r\n\r\nBut I will put the truth of my assertion, past all doubt: I mean, that\r\nthis liquor is by one important innovation, grown of ill example, and\r\ndangerous consequence to the public. It is well known, that, by the true\r\noriginal institution of making punch, left us by Captain Ratcliffe, the\r\nsharpness is only occasioned by the juice of lemons, and so continued\r\ntill after the happy Revolution. Oranges, alas! are a mere innovation,\r\nand in a manner but of yesterday. It was the politics of Jacobites to\r\nintroduce them gradually: And, to what intent? The thing speaks itself.\r\nIt was cunningly to shew their virulence against his sacred Majesty King\r\nWilliam, of ever glorious and immortal memory. But of late, (to shew how\r\nfast disloyalty increaseth) they came from one or two, and then to three\r\noranges; nay, at present we often find punch made all with oranges, and\r\nnot one single lemon. For the Jacobites, before the death of that\r\nimmortal Prince, had, by a superstition, formed a private prayer, that,\r\nas they squeezed the orange, so might that Protestant King be squeezed\r\nto death[177]: According to that known sorcery described by Virgil,\r\n\r\n  Limus ut hic durescit, et hæc ut cera liquescit, &c.\r\n                                             [Ecl. viii. 80.]\r\n\r\nAnd, thus the Romans, when they sacrificed an ox, used this kind of\r\nprayer. \"As I knock down this ox, so may thou, O Jupiter, knock down our\r\nenemies.\" In like manner, after King William's death, whenever a\r\nJacobite squeezed an orange, he had a mental curse upon the \"glorious\r\nmemory,\" and a hearty wish for power to squeeze all his Majesty's\r\nfriends to death, as he squeezed that orange, which bore one of his\r\ntitles, as he was Prince of Orange. This I do affirm for truth; many of\r\nthat faction having confessed it to me, under an oath of secrecy; which,\r\nhowever, I thought it my duty not to keep, when I saw my dear country in\r\ndanger. But, what better can be expected from an impious set of men, who\r\nnever scruple to drink _confusion_ to all true Protestants, under the\r\nname of Whigs? a most unchristian and inhuman practice, which, to our\r\ngreat honour and comfort, was never charged upon us, even by our most\r\nmalicious detractors.\r\n\r\nThe sign of two angels, hovering in the air, and with their right hands\r\nsupporting a crown, is met with in several parts of this city; and hath\r\noften given me great offence: For, whether by the unskilfulness, or\r\ndangerous principles of the painters, (although I have good reasons to\r\nsuspect the latter) those angels are usually drawn with such horrid\r\ncountenances, that they give great offence to every loyal eye, and equal\r\ncause of triumph to the Jacobites being a most infamous reflection upon\r\nour most able and excellent ministry.\r\n\r\nI now return to that great enormity of our city cries; most of which we\r\nhave borrowed from London. I shall consider them only in a political\r\nview, as they nearly affect the peace and safety of both kingdoms; and\r\nhaving been originally contrived by wicked Machiavels, to bring in\r\nPopery, slavery, and arbitrary power, by defeating the Protestant\r\nSuccession, and introducing the Pretender, ought, in justice, to be here\r\nlaid open to the world.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three months after the happy Revolution, all persons who\r\npossessed any employment, or office, in Church or State, were obliged by\r\nan Act of Parliament, to take the oaths to King William and Queen Mary:\r\nAnd a great number of disaffected persons, refusing to take the said\r\noaths, from a pretended scruple of conscience, but really from a spirit\r\nof Popery and rebellion, they contrived a plot, to make the swearing to\r\nthose Princes odious in the eyes of the people. To this end, they hired\r\ncertain women of ill fame, but loud shrill voices, under pretence of\r\nselling fish, to go through the streets, with sieves on their heads, and\r\ncry, \"Buy my soul, buy my soul;\" plainly insinuating, that all those who\r\nswore to King William, were just ready to sell their souls for an\r\nemployment. This cry was revived at the death of Queen Anne, and, I\r\nhear, still continues in London, with great offence to all true\r\nProtestants; but, to our great happiness, seems to be almost dropped in\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nBut, because I altogether contemn the displeasure and resentment of\r\nhigh-fliers, Tories, and Jacobites, whom I look upon to be worse even\r\nthan professed Papists, I do here declare, that those evils which I am\r\ngoing to mention, were all brought in upon us in the _worst of times_,\r\nunder the late Earl of Oxford's administration, during the four last\r\nyears of Queen Anne's reign. _That wicked minister was universally known\r\nto be a Papist in his heart. He was of a most avaricious nature, and is\r\nsaid to have died worth four millions, sterl.[178] besides his vast\r\nexpenses in building, statues, gold plate, jewels, and other costly\r\nrarities. He was of a mean obscure birth, from the very dregs of the\r\npeople, and so illiterate, that he could hardly read a paper at the\r\ncouncil table. I forbear to touch at his open, profane, profligate life;\r\nbecause I desire not to rake into the ashes of the dead, and therefore\r\nI shall observe this wise maxim:_ De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\r\n\r\nThis flagitious man, in order to compass his black designs, employed\r\ncertain wicked instruments (which great statesmen are never without) to\r\nadapt several London cries, in such a manner as would best answer his\r\nends. And, whereas it was upon grounds grievously suspected, that all\r\nplaces at Court were sold to the highest bidder: Certain women were\r\nemployed by his emissaries, to carry fish in baskets on their heads, and\r\nbawl through the streets, \"Buy my fresh places.\" I must, indeed, own\r\nthat other women used the same cry, who were innocent of this wicked\r\ndesign, and really sold their fish of that denomination to get an honest\r\nlivelihood; but the rest, who were in the secret, although they carried\r\nfish in their sieves or baskets, to save appearances; yet they had\r\nlikewise, a certain sign, somewhat resembling that of the free-masons,\r\nwhich the purchasers of places knew well enough, and were directed by\r\nthe women whither they were to resort, and make their purchase. And, I\r\nremember very well, how oddly it looked, when we observed many gentlemen\r\nfinely dressed, about the Court end of the town, and as far as York\r\nBuildings, where the Lord Treasurer Oxford dwelt, calling the women who\r\ncried \"Buy my fresh places,\" and talking to them in the corner of a\r\nstreet, after they understood each other's sign: But we never could\r\nobserve that any fish was bought.\r\n\r\nSome years before the cries last mentioned, the Duke of Savoy was\r\nreported to have made certain overtures to the Court of England, for\r\nadmitting his eldest son by the Duchess of Orleans's daughter, to\r\nsucceed to the Crown, as next heir, upon the Pretender's being rejected,\r\nand that son was immediately to turn Protestant. It was confidently\r\nreported, that great numbers of people disaffected to the then\r\nillustrious but now Royal House of Hanover, were in those measures.\r\nWhereupon another set of women were hired by the Jacobite leaders, to\r\ncry through the whole town, \"Buy my Savoys, dainty Savoys, curious\r\nSavoys.\" But, I cannot directly charge the late Earl of Oxford with this\r\nconspiracy, because he was not then chief Minister. However, the wicked\r\ncry still continues in London, and was brought over hither, where it\r\nremains to this day, and in my humble opinion, a very offensive sound to\r\nevery true Protestant, who is old enough to remember those dangerous\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nDuring the Ministry of that corrupt and Jacobite earl above-mentioned,\r\nthe secret pernicious design of those in power, was to sell Flanders to\r\nFrance; the consequence of which, must have been the infallible ruin of\r\nthe States-General, and would have opened the way for France to obtain\r\nthat universal monarchy, after which they have so long aspired; to which\r\nthe British dominions must next, after Holland, have been compelled to\r\nsubmit, and the Protestant religion would be rooted out of the world.\r\n\r\nA design of this vast importance, after long consultation among the\r\nJacobite grandees, with the Earl of Oxford at their head, was at last\r\ndetermined to be carried on by the same method with the former; it was\r\ntherefore again put in practice; but the conduct of it was chiefly left\r\nto chosen men, whose voices were louder and stronger than those of the\r\nother sex. And upon this occasion, was first instituted in London, that\r\nfamous cry of \"FLOUNDERS.\" But the criers were particularly\r\ndirected to pronounce the word \"Flaunders,\" and not \"Flounders.\" For,\r\nthe country which we now by corruption call Flanders, is in its true\r\northography spelt Flaunders, as may be obvious to all who read old\r\nEnglish books. I say, from hence begun that thundering cry, which hath\r\never since stunned the ears of all London, made so many children fall\r\ninto fits, and women miscarry; \"Come buy my fresh flaunders, curious\r\nflaunders, charming flaunders, alive, alive, ho;\" which last words can\r\nwith no propriety of speech be applied to fish manifestly dead, (as I\r\nobserved before in herrings and salmon) but very justly to ten\r\nprovinces, which contain many millions of living Christians. And the\r\napplication is still closer, when we consider that all the people were\r\nto be taken like fishes in a net; and, by assistance of the Pope, who\r\nsets up to be the universal Fisher of Men, the whole innocent nation,\r\nwas, according to our common expression, to be \"laid as flat as a\r\nflounder.\"\r\n\r\nI remember, myself, a particular crier of flounders in London, who\r\narrived at so much fame for the loudness of his voice, that he had the\r\nhonour to be mentioned upon that account, in a comedy. He hath\r\ndisturbed me many a morning, before he came within fifty doors of my\r\nlodging. And although I were not in those days so fully apprized of the\r\ndesigns, which our common enemy had then in agitation, yet, I know not\r\nhow, by a secret impulse, young as I was, I could not forbear conceiving\r\na strong dislike against the fellow; and often said to myself, \"This cry\r\nseems to be forged in the Jesuits' school. Alas, poor England! I am\r\ngrievously mistaken if there be not some Popish Plot at the bottom.\" I\r\ncommunicated my thoughts to an intimate friend, who reproached me with\r\nbeing too visionary in my speculations: But, it proved afterwards, that\r\nI conjectured right. And I have often since reflected, that if the\r\nwicked faction could have procured only a thousand men, of as strong\r\nlungs as the fellow I mentioned, none can tell how terrible the\r\nconsequences might have been, not only to these two Kingdoms, but over\r\nall Europe, by selling Flanders to France. And yet these cries continue\r\nunpunished, both in London and Dublin, although I confess, not with\r\nequal vehemency or loudness, because the reason for contriving this\r\ndesperate plot, is, to our great felicity, wholly ceased.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that the majority of the British House of Commons in\r\nthe last years of Queen Anne's reign, were in their hearts directly\r\nopposite to the Earl of Oxford's pernicious measures; which put him\r\nunder the necessity of bribing them with salaries. Whereupon he had\r\nagain recourse to his old politics. And accordingly, his emissaries were\r\nvery busy in employing certain artful women of no good life or\r\nconversation, (as it was fully proved before Justice Peyton) to cry that\r\nvegetable commonly called celery, through the town. These women differed\r\nfrom the common criers of that herb, by some private mark which I could\r\nnever learn; but the matter was notorious enough, and sufficiently\r\ntalked of, and about the same period was the cry of celery brought over\r\ninto this kingdom. But since there is not at this present, the least\r\noccasion to suspect the loyalty of our criers upon that article, I am\r\ncontent that it may still be tolerated.\r\n\r\nI shall mention but one cry more, which hath any reference to politics;\r\nbut is indeed, of all others the most insolent, as well as treasonable,\r\nunder our present happy Establishment. I mean that of turnups; not of\r\nturnips, according to the best orthography, but absolutely turnups.\r\nAlthough this cry be of an older date than some of the preceding\r\nenormities, for it began soon after the Revolution; yet was it never\r\nknown to arrive at so great a height, as during the Earl of Oxford's\r\npower. Some people, (whom I take to be private enemies) are, indeed, as\r\nready as myself to profess their disapprobation of this cry, on pretence\r\nthat it began by the contrivance of certain old procuresses, who kept\r\nhouses of ill-fame, where lewd women met to draw young men into vice.\r\nAnd this they pretend to prove by some words in the cry; because, after\r\nthe crier had bawled out, \"Turnups, ho, buy my dainty turnups,\" he would\r\nsometimes add the two following verses:--\r\n\r\n  \"Turn up the mistress, and turn up the maid,\r\n  And turn up the daughter, and be not afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThis, say some political sophists, plainly shews that there can be\r\nnothing further meant in this infamous cry, than an invitation to\r\nlewdness, which indeed, ought to be severely punished in all\r\nwell-regulated Governments; but cannot be fairly interpreted as a crime\r\nof State. But, I hope, we are not so weak and blind to be deluded at\r\nthis time of day, with such poor evasions. I could, if it were proper,\r\ndemonstrate the very time when those two verses were composed, and name\r\nthe author, who was no other than the famous Mr. Swan, so well known for\r\nhis talent at quibbling, and was as virulent a Jacobite as any in\r\nEngland. Neither could he deny the fact, when he was taxed for it in my\r\npresence by Sir Harry Button-Colt, and Colonel Davenport, at the Smyrna\r\ncoffee-house, on the 10th of June, 1701. Thus it appears to a\r\ndemonstration, that those verses were only a blind to conceal the most\r\ndangerous designs of that party, who from the first years after the\r\nhappy Revolution, used a cant way of talking in their clubs after this\r\nmanner: \"We hope, to see the cards shuffled once more, and another king\r\nTURN UP trump:\" And, \"When shall we meet over a dish of\r\nTURNUPS?\" The same term of art was used in their plots against\r\nthe government, and in their treasonable letters writ in ciphers, and\r\ndeciphered by the famous Dr. Wallis, as you may read in the trials of\r\nthose times. This I thought fit to set forth at large, and in so clear\r\na light, because the Scotch and French authors have given a very\r\ndifferent account of the word TURNUP, but whether out of\r\nignorance or partiality I shall not decree; because I am sure, the\r\nreader is convinced by my discovery. It is to be observed, that this cry\r\nwas sung in a particular manner by fellows in disguise, to give notice\r\nwhere those traitors were to meet, in order to concert their villainous\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nI have no more to add upon this article, than an humble proposal, that\r\nthose who cry this root at present in our streets of Dublin, may be\r\ncompelled by the justices of the peace, to pronounce turnip, and not\r\nturnup; for, I am afraid, we have still too many snakes in our bosom;\r\nand it would be well if their cellars were sometimes searched, when the\r\nowners least expect it; for I am not out of fear that _latet anguis in\r\nherbâ_.\r\n\r\nThus, we are zealous in matters of small moment, while we neglect those\r\nof the highest importance. I have already made it manifest, that all\r\nthese cries were contrived in the _worst of times_, under the ministry\r\nof that desperate statesman, Robert, late Earl of Oxford, and for that\r\nvery reason ought to be rejected with horror, as begun in the reign of\r\nJacobites, and may well be numbered among the rags of Popery and\r\ntreason: Or if it be thought proper, that these cries must continue,\r\nsurely they ought to be only trusted in the hands of true Protestants,\r\nwho have given security to the government.\r\n\r\n[Having already spoken of many abuses relating to signposts, I cannot\r\nhere omit one more, because it plainly relates to politics; and is,\r\nperhaps, of more dangerous consequence than any of the city cries,\r\nbecause it directly tends to destroy the succession. It is the sign of\r\nhis present Majesty King George the Second, to be met with in many\r\nstreets; and yet I happen to be not only the first, but the only,\r\ndiscoverer of this audacious instance of Jacobitism. And I am confident,\r\nthat, if the justices of the peace would please to make a strict\r\ninspection, they might find, in all such houses, before which those\r\nsigns are hung up in the manner I have observed, that the landlords were\r\nmalignant Papists, or, which is worse, notorious Jacobites. Whoever\r\nviews those signs, may read, over his Majesty's head, the following\r\nletters and ciphers, G. R. II., which plainly signifies George, King the\r\nSecond, and not King George the Second, or George the Second, King; but\r\nlaying the point after the letter G, by which the owner of the house\r\nmanifestly shews, that he renounces his allegiance to King George the\r\nSecond, and allows him to be only the second king, _inuendo_, that the\r\nPretender is the first king; and looking upon King George to be only a\r\nkind of second king, or viceroy, till the Pretender shall come over and\r\nseize the kingdom. I appeal to all mankind, whether this be a strained\r\nor forced interpretation of the inscription, as it now stands in almost\r\nevery street; whether any decipherer would make the least doubt or\r\nhesitation to explain it as I have done; whether any other Protestant\r\ncountry would endure so public an instance of treason in the capital\r\ncity from such vulgar conspirators; and, lastly, whether Papists and\r\nJacobites of great fortunes and quality may not probably stand behind\r\nthe curtain in this dangerous, open, and avowed design against the\r\ngovernment. But I have performed my duty; and leave the reforming of\r\nthese abuses to the wisdom, the vigilance, the loyalty, and activity of\r\nmy superiors.][179]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SERIOUS AND USEFUL SCHEME\r\n\r\nTO MAKE AN\r\n\r\nHOSPITAL FOR INCURABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     This piece, included by Sir Walter Scott for the first time among\r\n     Swift's writings, was, in the opinion of that editor, indisputably\r\n     the work of the Dean of St. Patrick's. The present editor sees no\r\n     reason to disagree with this judgement, and it is therefore\r\n     reprinted here. The original issue of 1733, printed by Faulkner\r\n     contained also Swift's \"Petition of the Footmen in and about\r\n     Dublin,\" and had a lengthy advertisement of the Complete Works of\r\n     Swift which Faulkner was, at that time, projecting. It is\r\n     difficult, however, to understand why the tract was not included in\r\n     later editions of Swift's complete works. Sir Walter Scott puts\r\n     forward an explanation suggested by Dr. Barrett, who believed the\r\n     reason to have been, that this \"_jeu d'esprit_ might be interpreted\r\n     as casting a slur on an hospital erected upon Lazors-Hill, now on\r\n     the Donny-Brook road near Dublin, for the reception of persons\r\n     afflicted with incurable maladies.\" The reason seems a poor one,\r\n     though it may have been as Dr. Barrett states. A better argument\r\n     might be found from the style and subject matter of the tract\r\n     itself. The style is strongly Swift's, and the subject of such an\r\n     hospital must certainly have occupied Swift's thoughts at this\r\n     time, since he left his fortune for the erection of a similar\r\n     building.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of the present edition is based on that of the volume\r\n     issued by Faulkner in 1733, compared with the Dublin reprint of the\r\n     following year.\r\n\r\n     [T.

The diseased and unfortunate\r\nare thereby delivered from the misery of wanting assistance; and others\r\nare delivered from the misery of beholding them.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that the genius of the people of England is strongly\r\nturned to public charities; and to so noble a degree, that almost in\r\nevery part of this great and opulent city, and also in many of the\r\nadjacent villages, we meet with a great variety of hospitals, supported\r\nby the generous contributions of private families, as well as by the\r\nliberality of the public. Some for seamen worn out in the service of\r\ntheir country, and others for infirm disabled soldiers; some for the\r\nmaintenance of tradesmen decayed, and others for their widows and\r\norphans; some for the service of those who linger under tedious\r\ndistempers, and others for such as are deprived of their reason.\r\n\r\nBut I find, upon nice inspection, that there is one kind of charity\r\nalmost totally disregarded, which, nevertheless, appears to me of so\r\nexcellent a nature, as to be at present more wanted, and better\r\ncalculated for the ease, quietness, and felicity of this whole kingdom,\r\nthan any other can possibly be. I mean an hospital for incurables.\r\n\r\nI must indeed confess, that an endowment of this nature would prove a\r\nvery large and perpetual expense. However, I have not the least\r\ndiffidence, that I shall be able effectually to convince the world that\r\nmy present scheme for such an hospital is very practicable, and must be\r\nvery desirable by every one who hath the interest of his country, or his\r\nfellow-creatures, really at heart.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that, although the bodies of human creatures be\r\naffected with an infinite variety of disorders, which elude the power of\r\nmedicine, and are often found to be incurable, yet their minds are also\r\noverrun with an equal variety, which no skill, no power, no medicine,\r\ncan alter or amend. And I think, that, out of regard to the public peace\r\nand emolument, as well as the repose of many pious and valuable\r\nfamilies, this latter species of incurables ought principally to engage\r\nour attention and beneficence.\r\n\r\nI believe an Hospital for such Incurables will be universally allowed\r\nnecessary, if we only consider what numbers of absolute incurables every\r\nprofession, rank, and degree, would perpetually produce, which, at\r\npresent, are only national grievances, and of which we can have no other\r\neffectual method to purge the kingdom.\r\n\r\nFor instance; let any man seriously consider what numbers there are of\r\nincurable fools, incurable knaves, incurable scolds, incurable\r\nscribblers, (besides myself,) incurable coxcombs, incurable infidels,\r\nincurable liars, incurable whores, in all places of public resort:--not\r\nto mention the incurably vain, incurably envious, incurably proud,\r\nincurably affected, incurably impertinent, and ten thousand other\r\nincurables, which I must of necessity pass over in silence, lest I\r\nshould swell this essay into a volume. And without doubt, every\r\nunprejudiced person will agree, that, out of mere Christian charity, the\r\npublic ought to be eased as much as possible of this troublesome and\r\nintolerable variety of incurables.\r\n\r\nAnd first, Under the denomination of incurable fools, we may reasonably\r\nexpect, that such an hospital would be furnished with considerable\r\nnumbers of the growth of our own universities; who, at present, appear\r\nin various professions in the world, under the venerable titles of\r\nphysicians, barristers, and ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nAnd as those ancient seminaries have been, for some years past,\r\naccounted little better than nurseries of such sort of incurables, it\r\nshould seem highly commendable to make some kind of provision for them;\r\nbecause it is more than probable, that, if they are to be supported by\r\ntheir own particular merit in their several callings, they must\r\nnecessarily acquire but a very indifferent maintenance.\r\n\r\nI would not, willingly, be here suspected to cast reflections on any\r\norder of men, as if I thought that small gains from the profession of\r\nany art or science, were always an undoubted sign of an equally small\r\ndegree of understanding; for I profess myself to be somewhat inclined to\r\na very opposite opinion, having frequently observed, that at the bar,\r\nthe pulse, and the pulpit, those who have the least learning or sense to\r\nplead, meet generally with the largest share of promotions and profit:\r\nof which many instances might be produced; but the public seems to want\r\nno conviction in this particular.\r\n\r\nUnder the same denominations we may further expect a large and\r\nridiculous quantity of old rich widows; whose eager and impatient\r\nappetites inflame them with extravagant passions for fellows of a very\r\ndifferent age and complexion from themselves; who purchase contempt and\r\naversion with good jointures; and being loaded with years, infirmities,\r\nand probably ill humour, are forced to bribe into their embraces such\r\nwhose fortunes and characters are equally desperate.\r\n\r\nBesides, our collection of incurable fools would receive an incredible\r\naddition from every one of the following articles.\r\n\r\nFrom young extravagant heirs; who are just of a competent age to become\r\nthe bubbles of jockeys, sportsmen, gamesters, bullies, sharpers,\r\ncourtesans, and such sort of honourable pickpockets.\r\n\r\nFrom misers; who half starve themselves to feed the prodigality of their\r\nheirs, and who proclaim to the world how unworthy they are of possessing\r\nestates, by the wretched and ridiculous methods they take to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nFrom contentious people, of all conditions; who are content to waste the\r\ngreatest part of their own fortunes at law, to be the instruments of\r\nimpoverishing others.\r\n\r\nFrom those who have any confidence in profession of friendship, before\r\ntrial; or any dependence on the fidelity of a mistress.\r\n\r\nFrom young illiterate squires, who travel abroad to import lewdness,\r\nconceit, arrogance, vanity, and foppery; of which commodities there\r\nseems to be so great an abundance at home.\r\n\r\nFrom young clergymen; who contrive, by matrimony, to acquire a family,\r\nbefore they have obtained the necessary means to maintain one.\r\n\r\nFrom those who have considerable estates in different kingdoms, and yet\r\nare so incurably stupid as to spend their whole incomes in this.\r\n\r\nThese, and several other articles which might be mentioned, would afford\r\nus a perpetual opportunity of easing the public, by having an hospital\r\nfor the accommodation of such incurables; who, at present, either by the\r\nover-fondness of near relations, or the indolence of the magistrates,\r\nare permitted to walk abroad, and appear in the most crowded places of\r\nthis city, as if they were indeed reasonable creatures.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot to hint, that, under this article, there is a modest\r\nprobability that many of the clergy would be found properly qualified\r\nfor admittance into the hospital, who might serve in the capacity of\r\nchaplains, and save the unnecessary expense of salaries.\r\n\r\nTo these fools, in order succeed such as may justly be included under\r\nthe extensive denomination of incurable knaves; of which our several\r\nInns of Court would constantly afford us abundant supplies.\r\n\r\nI think indeed, that, of this species of incurables, there ought to be a\r\ncertain limited number annually admitted; which number, neither any\r\nregard to the quiet or benefit of the nation, nor any other charitable\r\nor public-spirited reason, should tempt us to exceed; because, if all\r\nwere to be admitted on such a foundation, who might be reputed incurable\r\nof this distemper; and if it were possible for the public to find any\r\nplace large enough for their reception; I have not the least doubt, that\r\nall our Inns, which are at this day so crowded, would in a short time be\r\nemptied of their inhabitants; and the law, that beneficial craft, want\r\nhands to conduct it.\r\n\r\nI tremble to think what herds of attorneys, solicitors, pettifoggers,\r\nscriveners, usurers, hackney-clerks, pickpockets, pawn-brokers, jailors,\r\nand justices of the peace, would hourly be driven to such an hospital;\r\nand what disturbance it might also create in several noble and wealthy\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nWhat unexpected distress might it prove to several men of fortune and\r\nquality, to be suddenly deprived of their rich stewards, in whom they\r\nhad for many years reposed the utmost confidence, and to find them\r\nirrecoverably lodged among such a collection of incurables!\r\n\r\nHow many orphans might then expect to see their guardians hurried away\r\nto the hospital; and how many greedy executors find reason to lament the\r\nwant of opportunity to pillage!\r\n\r\nWould not Exchange Alley have cause to mourn for the loss of its\r\nstock-jobbers and brokers; and the Charitable Corporation for the\r\nconfinement of many of its directors?\r\n\r\nMight not Westminster-Hall, as well as all the gaming-houses in this\r\ngreat city, be entirely unpeopled; and the professors of art in each of\r\nthose assemblies become useless in their vocations, by being deprived of\r\nall future opportunity to be dishonest?\r\n\r\nIn short, it might put the whole kingdom into confusion and disorder;\r\nand we should find that the entire revenues of this nation would be\r\nscarce able to support so great a number of incurables, in this way, as\r\nwould appear qualified for admission into our hospital.\r\n\r\nFor if we only consider how this kingdom swarms with quadrille-tables,\r\nand gaming-houses, both public and private; and also how each of those\r\nhouses, as well as Westminster-Hall aforesaid, swarms with knaves who\r\nare anxious to win, or fools who have anything to lose; we may be soon\r\nconvinced how necessary it will be to limit the number of incurables,\r\ncomprehended under these titles, lest the foundation should prove\r\ninsufficient to maintain any others besides them.\r\n\r\nHowever, if, by this Scheme of mine, the nation can be eased of twenty\r\nor thirty thousand such incurables, I think it ought to be esteemed\r\nsomewhat beneficial, and worthy of the attention of the public.\r\n\r\nThe next sort for whom I would gladly provide, and who for several\r\ngenerations have proved insupportable plagues and grievances to the good\r\npeople of England, are those who may properly be admitted under the\r\ncharacter of incurable scolds.\r\n\r\nI own this to be a temper of so desperate a nature, that few females can\r\nbe found willing to own themselves anyway addicted to it; and yet, it\r\nis thought that there is scarce a single parson, 'prentice, alderman,\r\nsquire, or husband, who would not solemnly avouch the very reverse.\r\n\r\nI could wish, indeed, that the word scold might be changed for some more\r\ngentle term, of equal signification; because I am convinced, that the\r\nvery name is as offensive to female ears, as the effects of that\r\nincurable distemper are to the ears of the men; which, to be sure, is\r\ninexpressible.\r\n\r\nAnd that it hath been always customary to honour the very same kind of\r\nactions with different appellations, only to avoid giving offence, is\r\nevident to common observation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: How many lawyers, attorneys, solicitors, under-sheriffs,\r\nintriguing chambermaids, and counter-officers, are continually guilty of\r\nextortion, bribery, oppression, and many other profitable knaveries, to\r\ndrain the purses of those with whom they are any way concerned! And yet,\r\nall these different expedients to raise a fortune, pass generally under\r\nthe milder names of fees, perquisites, vails, presents, gratuities, and\r\nsuch like; although, in strictness of speech, they should be called\r\nrobbery, and consequently be rewarded with a gibbet.\r\n\r\nNay, how many honourable gentlemen might be enumerated, who keep open\r\nshop to make a trade of iniquity; who teach the law to wink whenever\r\npower or profit appears in her way; and contrive to grow rich by the\r\nvice, the contention, or the follies of mankind; and who, nevertheless,\r\ninstead of being branded with the harsh-sounding names of knaves,\r\npilferers, or public oppressors, (as they justly merit,) are only\r\ndistinguished by the title of justices of the peace; in which single\r\nterm, all those several appellations are generally thought to be\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. When first I determined to prepare this Scheme for the\r\nuse and inspection of the public, I intended to examine one whole ward\r\nin this city, that my computation of the number of incurable scolds\r\nmight be more perfect and exact. But I found it impossible to finish my\r\nprogress through more than one street.\r\n\r\nI made my first application to a wealthy citizen in Cornhill,\r\ncommon-council-man for his ward; to whom I hinted, that if he knew e'er\r\nan incurable scold in the neighbourhood, I had some hope to provide for\r\nher in such a manner, as to hinder her from being further troublesome.\r\nHe referred me with great delight to his next-door friend; yet whispered\r\nme, that, with much greater ease and pleasure, he could furnish me out\r\nof his own family ----; and begged the preference.\r\n\r\nHis next-door friend owned readily that his wife's qualifications were\r\nnot misrepresented, and that he would cheerfully contribute to promote\r\nso useful a scheme; but positively asserted, that it would be of small\r\nservice to rid the neighbourhood of one woman, while such multitudes\r\nwould remain all equally insupportable.\r\n\r\nBy which circumstance I conjectured, that the quantity of these\r\nincurables in London, Westminster, and Southwark, would be very\r\nconsiderable; and that a generous contribution might reasonably be\r\nexpected for such an hospital as I am recommending.\r\n\r\nBesides, the number of these female incurables would probably be very\r\nmuch increased by additional quantities of old maids; who, being wearied\r\nwith concealing their ill-humour for one-half of their lives, are\r\nimpatient to give it full vent in the other. For old maids, like old\r\nthin-bodied wines, instead of growing more agreeable by years, are\r\nobserved, for the most part, to become intolerably sharp, sour, and\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nUnder this denomination also, we may expect to be furnished with as\r\nlarge a collection of old bachelors, especially those who have estates,\r\nand but a moderate degree of understanding. For, an old wealthy\r\nbachelor, being perpetually surrounded with a set of flatterers,\r\ncousins, poor dependents, and would-be heirs, who for their own views\r\nsubmit to his perverseness and caprice, becomes insensibly infected with\r\nthis scolding malady, which generally proves incurable, and renders him\r\ndisagreeable to his friends, and a fit subject for ridicule to his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nAs to the incurable scribblers, (of which society I have the honour to\r\nbe a member,) they probably are innumerable; and, of consequence, it\r\nwill be absolutely impossible to provide for one-tenth part of their\r\nfraternity. However, as this set of incurables are generally more\r\nplagued with poverty than any other, it will be a double charity to\r\nadmit them on the foundation; a charity to the world, to whom they are a\r\ncommon pest and nuisance; and a charity to themselves, to relieve them\r\nfrom want, contempt, kicking, and several other accidents of that\r\nnature, to which they are continually liable.\r\n\r\nGrub-street itself would then have reason to rejoice, to see so many of\r\nits half-starved manufacturers amply provided for; and the whole tribe\r\nof meagre incurables would probably shout for joy, at being delivered\r\nfrom the tyranny and garrets of printers, publishers, and booksellers.\r\n\r\nWhat a mixed multitude of ballad-writers, ode-makers, translators,\r\nfarce-compounders, opera-mongers, biographers, pamphleteers, and\r\njournalists, would appear crowding to the hospital; not unlike the\r\nbrutes resorting to the ark before the deluge! And what an universal\r\nsatisfaction would such a sight afford to all, except pastry-cooks,\r\ngrocers, chandlers, and tobacco-retailers, to whom alone the writings of\r\nthose incurables were anyway profitable!\r\n\r\nI have often been amazed to observe, what a variety of incurable\r\ncoxcombs are to be met with between St. James's and Limehouse, at every\r\nhour of the day; as numerous as Welsh parsons, and equally contemptible.\r\nHow they swarm in all coffeehouses, theatres, public walks, and private\r\nassemblies; how they are incessantly employed in cultivating intrigues,\r\nand every kind of irrational pleasure; how industrious they seem to\r\nmimic the appearance of monkeys, as monkeys are emulous to imitate the\r\ngestures of men: And from such observations, I concluded, that to\r\nconfine the greatest part of those incurables, who are so many living\r\nburlesques of human nature, would be of eminent service to this nation;\r\nand I am persuaded that I am far from being singular in that opinion.\r\n\r\nAs for the incurable infidels and liars, I shall range them under the\r\nsame article, and would willingly appoint them the same apartment in the\r\nhospital; because there is a much nearer resemblance between them, than\r\nis generally imagined.\r\n\r\nHave they not an equal delight in imposing falsities on the public; and\r\nseem they not equally desirous to be thought of more sagacity and\r\nimportance than others? Do they not both report what both know to be\r\nfalse; and both confidently assert what they are conscious is most\r\nliable to contradiction?\r\n\r\nThe parallel might easily be carried on much further, if the intended\r\nshortness of this essay would admit it. However, I cannot forbear taking\r\nnotice, with what immense quantities of incurable liars his Majesty's\r\nkingdoms are overrun; what offence and prejudice they are to the public;\r\nwhat inconceivable injury to private persons; and what a necessity there\r\nis for an hospital, to relieve the nation from the curse of so many\r\nincurables.\r\n\r\nThis distemper appears almost in as many different shapes, as there are\r\npersons afflicted with it; and, in every individual, is always beyond\r\nthe power of medicine.\r\n\r\nSome lie for their interest; such as fishmongers, flatterers, pimps,\r\nlawyers, fortune-hunters, and fortune-tellers; and others lie for their\r\nentertainment, as maids, wives, widows, and all other tea-table\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nSome lie out of vanity, as poets, painters, players, fops, military\r\nofficers, and all those who frequent the levees of the great: and others\r\nlie out of ill nature, as old maids, &c.\r\n\r\nSome lie out of custom, as lovers, coxcombs, footmen, sailors,\r\nmechanics, merchants, and chambermaids; and others lie out of\r\ncomplaisance or necessity, as courtiers, chaplains, &c. In short, it\r\nwere endless to enumerate them all, but this sketch may be sufficient to\r\ngive us some small imperfect idea of their numbers.\r\n\r\nAs to the remaining incurables, we may reasonably conclude, that they\r\nbear at least an equal proportion to those already mentioned; but with\r\nregard to the incurable whores in this kingdom, I must particularly\r\nobserve, that such of them as are public, and make it their profession,\r\nhave proper hospitals for their reception already, if we could find\r\nmagistrates without passions, or officers without an incurable itch to a\r\nbribe. And such of them as are private, and make it their amusement, I\r\nshould be unwilling to disturb, for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because it might probably afflict many noble, wealthy, contented,\r\nand unsuspecting husbands, by convincing them of their own dishonour,\r\nand the unpardonable disloyalty of their wives: And, secondly, Because\r\nit will be for ever impossible to confine a woman from being guilty of\r\nany kind of misconduct, when once she is firmly resolved to attempt it.\r\n\r\nFrom all which observations, every reasonable man must infallibly be\r\nconvinced, that an hospital for the support of these different kinds of\r\nincurables, would be extremely beneficial to these kingdoms. I think,\r\ntherefore, that nothing further is wanting, but to demonstrate to the\r\npublic, that such a Scheme is very practicable; both by having an\r\nundoubted method to raise an annual income, at least sufficient to make\r\nthe experiment, (which is the way of founding all hospitals,) and by\r\nhaving also a strong probability, that such an hospital would be\r\nsupported by perpetual benefactions; which, in very few years, might\r\nenable us to increase the number of incurables to nine-tenths more than\r\nwe can reasonably venture on at first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Computation of the Daily and Annual Expenses of an Hospital, to be\r\nerected for Incurables._\r\n\r\n                                                                  Per day.\r\n\r\n  Incurable fools, are almost infinite; however, at\r\n  first, I would have only twenty thousand admitted;\r\n  and, allowing to each person but one shilling per\r\n  day for maintenance, which is as low as possible, the\r\n  daily expense for this article will be                            £1000\r\n\r\n  Incurable knaves, are, if possible, more numerous,\r\n  including foreigners, especially Irishmen. Yet I\r\n  would limit the number of these to about thirty\r\n  thousand; which would amount to                                    1500\r\n\r\n  Incurable scolds, would be plentifully supplied\r\n  from almost every family in the kingdom. And indeed,\r\n  to make this hospital of any real benefit, we\r\n  cannot admit fewer, even at first, than thirty thousand,\r\n  including the ladies of Billingsgate and Leadenhall\r\n  market, which is                                                   1500\r\n\r\n  The incurable scribblers, are undoubtedly a very\r\n  considerable society, and of that denomination I\r\n  would admit at least forty thousand; because it is\r\n  to be supposed, that such incurables will be found\r\n  in greatest distress for a daily maintenance. And\r\n  if we had not great encouragement to hope, that\r\n  many of that class would properly be admitted\r\n  among the incurable fools, I should strenuously intercede\r\n  to have ten or twenty thousand more added.\r\n  But their allowed number will amount to                            2000\r\n\r\n  Incurable coxcombs, are very numerous; and,\r\n  considering what numbers are annually imported\r\n  from France and Italy, we cannot admit fewer than\r\n  ten thousand, which will be                                         500\r\n\r\n  Incurable infidels, (as they affect to be called)\r\n  should be received into the hospital to the number\r\n  of ten thousand. However, if it should accidentally\r\n  happen to grow into a fashion to be believers, it is\r\n  probable, that the great part of them would, in a\r\n  very short time, be dismissed from the hospital, as\r\n  perfectly cured. Their expense would be                             500\r\n\r\n  Incurable liars, are infinite in all parts of the kingdom;\r\n  and, making allowance for citizens' wives,\r\n  mercers, prentices, news-writers, old maids, and\r\n  flatterers, we cannot possibly allow a smaller number\r\n  than thirty thousand, which will amount to                         1500\r\n\r\n  The incurable envious, are in vast quantities\r\n  throughout this whole nation. Nor can it reasonably\r\n  be expected that their numbers should lessen, while\r\n  fame and honours are heaped upon some particular\r\n  persons, as the public reward of their superior\r\n  accomplishments, while others, who are equally excellent,\r\n  in their own opinions, are constrained to\r\n  live unnoticed and contemned. And, as it would\r\n  be impossible to provide for all those who are possessed\r\n  with this distemper, I should consent to admit\r\n  only twenty thousand at first, by way of experiment,\r\n  amounting to                                                       1000\r\n\r\n  Of the incurable vain, affected, and impertinent,\r\n  I should at least admit ten thousand; which number\r\n  I am confident will appear very inconsiderable, if\r\n  we include all degrees of females, from the duchess\r\n  to the chambermaid; all poets, who have had a little\r\n  success, especially in the dramatic way, and all\r\n  players, who have met with a small degree of approbation.\r\n  Amounting only to                                                   500\r\n\r\nBy which plain computation it is evident, that two hundred thousand\r\npersons will be daily provided for, and the allowance for maintaining\r\nthis collection of incurables may be seen in the following account.\r\n\r\n                                                                  Per day.\r\n  _For the Incurable_\r\n  Fools, being           20,000 at one shilling each               £1000\r\n  Knaves                 30,000          ditto                      1500\r\n  Scolds                 30,000                                     1500\r\n  Scribblers             40,000                                     2000\r\n  Coxcombs               10,000                                      500\r\n  Infidels               10,000                                      500\r\n  Liars                  30,000                                     1500\r\n\r\n  _For the Incurably_\r\n  Envious                20,000                                     1000\r\n  Vain                   10,000                                      500\r\n                        _______                                   ______\r\n  Total maintained,     200,000                   Total expense, £10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    M. Th. H.\r\n  From whence it appears, that the daily expense\r\n  will amount to such a sum, as in 365\r\n  days comes to                                     £3,650,000\r\n\r\nAnd I am fully satisfied that a sum, much greater than this, may easily\r\nbe raised, with all possible satisfaction to the subject, and without\r\ninterfering in the least with the revenues of the crown.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a large proportion of this sum might be raised by\r\nthe voluntary contribution of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe computed number of people in Great Britain is very little less than\r\neight millions; of which, upon a most moderate computation, we may\r\naccount one half to be incurables. And as all those different\r\nincurables, whether acting in the capacity of friends, acquaintances,\r\nwives, husbands, daughters, counsellors, parents, old maids, or old\r\nbachelors, are inconceivable plagues to all those with whom they happen\r\nto be concerned; and as there is no hope of being eased of such plagues,\r\nexcept by such an hospital, which by degrees might be enlarged to\r\ncontain them all: I think it cannot be doubted, that at least three\r\nmillions and an half of people, out of the remaining proportion, would\r\nbe found both able and desirous to contribute so small a sum as twenty\r\nshillings _per annum_, for the quiet of the kingdom, the peace of\r\nprivate families, and the credit of the nation in general. And this\r\ncontribution would amount to very near our requisite sum.\r\n\r\nNor can this by any means be esteemed a wild conjecture; for where is\r\nthere a man of common sense, honesty, or good-nature, who would not\r\ngladly propose even a much greater sum to be freed from a scold, a\r\nknave, a fool, a liar, a coxcomb conceitedly repeating the compositions\r\nof others, or a vain impertinent poet repeating his own?\r\n\r\nIn the next place, it may justly be supposed, that many young noblemen,\r\nknights, squires, and extravagant heirs, with very large estates, would\r\nbe confined in our hospital. And I would propose, that the annual income\r\nof every particular incurable's estate should be appropriated to the use\r\nof the house. But, besides these, there will undoubtedly be many old\r\nmisers, aldermen, justices, directors of companies, templars, and\r\nmerchants of all kinds, whose personal fortunes are immense, and who\r\nshould proportionably pay to the hospital.\r\n\r\nYet, lest, by being here misunderstood, I should seem to propose an\r\nunjust or oppressive Scheme, I shall further explain my design.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, a young nobleman, possessed of ten or twenty\r\nthousand pounds _per annum_, should accidentally be confined there as an\r\nincurable: I would have only such a proportion of his estate applied to\r\nthe support of the hospital, as he himself would spend if he were at\r\nliberty. And, after his death, the profits of the estate should\r\nregularly devolve to the next lawful heir, whether male or female.\r\n\r\nAnd my reason for this proposal is; because considerable estates, which\r\nprobably would be squandered away among hounds, horses, whores,\r\nsharpers, surgeons, tailors, pimps, masquerades, or architects, if left\r\nto the management of such incurables; would, by this means, become of\r\nsome real use, both to the public and themselves. And perhaps this may\r\nbe the only method which can be found to make such young spendthrifts of\r\nany real benefit to their country.\r\n\r\nAnd although the estates of deceased incurables might be permitted to\r\ndescend to the next heirs, the hospital would probably sustain no great\r\ndisadvantage; because it is very likely that most of these heirs would\r\nalso gradually be admitted under some denomination or other; and\r\nconsequently their estates would again devolve to the use of the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nAs to the wealthy misers, &c., I would have their private fortunes\r\nnicely examined and calculated; because, if they were old bachelors, (as\r\nit would frequently happen,) their whole fortunes should then be\r\nappropriated to the endowment; but, if married, I would leave two-thirds\r\nof their fortunes for the support of their families; which families\r\nwould cheerfully consent to give away the remaining third, if not more,\r\nto be freed from such peevish and disagreeable governors.\r\n\r\nSo that, deducting from the two hundred thousand incurables the forty\r\nthousand scribblers, who to be sure would be found in very bad\r\ncircumstances; I believe, among the remaining hundred and sixty thousand\r\nfools, knaves, and coxcombs, so many would be found of large estates and\r\neasy fortunes, as would at least produce two hundred thousand pounds\r\n_per annum_.\r\n\r\nAs a further addition to our endowment, I would have a tax upon all\r\ninscriptions and tombstones, monuments and obelisks, erected to the\r\nhonour of the dead, or on porticoes and trophies, to the honour of the\r\nliving; because these will naturally and properly come under the article\r\nof lies, pride, vanity, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd if all inscriptions throughout this kingdom were impartially\r\nexamined, in order to tax those which should appear demonstrably false\r\nor flattering, I am convinced that not one-fifth part of the number\r\nwould, after such a scrutiny, escape exempted.\r\n\r\nMany an ambitious turbulent spirit would then be found, belied with the\r\nopposite title of \"lover of his country\"; and many a Middlesex justice,\r\nas improperly described, \"sleeping in hope of salvation.\"\r\n\r\nMany an usurer, discredited by the appellations of \"honest and frugal\";\r\nand many a lawyer, with the character of conscientious and \"equitable.\"\r\n\r\nMany a British statesman and general, decaying, with more honour than\r\nthey lived; and their dusts distinguished with a better reputation than\r\nwhen they were animated.\r\n\r\nMany dull parsons, improperly styled eloquent; and as many stupid\r\nphysicians, improperly styled learned.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the extensiveness of a tax upon such monumental\r\nimpositions, I will count only upon twenty thousand, at five pounds\r\n_per annum_ each, which will amount to one hundred thousand pounds\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nTo these annuities, I would also request the Parliament of this nation\r\nto allow the benefit of two lotteries yearly; by which the hospital\r\nwould gain two hundred thousand pounds clear. Nor can such a request\r\nseem any way extraordinary, since it would be appropriated to the\r\nbenefit of fools and knaves, which is the sole cause of granting one for\r\nthis present year.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, I would add the estate of Richard Norton, Esq.;[180]\r\nand, to do his memory all possible honour, I would have his statue\r\nerected in the very first apartment of the hospital, or in any other\r\nwhich might seem more apt. And, on his monument, I would permit a long\r\ninscription, composed by his dearest friends, which should remain\r\ntax-free for ever.\r\n\r\nFrom these several articles, therefore, would annually arise the\r\nfollowing sums.\r\n\r\n                                                           M.

But the whole\r\nmanagement of it should be left to the skill and discretion of those who\r\nare to be constituted governors.\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, prove a work of some small difficulty to fix upon a\r\ncommodious place, large enough for a building of this nature. I should\r\nhave thoughts of attempting to enclose all Yorkshire, if I were not\r\napprehensive that it would be crowded with so many incurable knaves of\r\nits own growth, that there would not be the least room left for the\r\nreception of any others; by which accident, our whole project might be\r\nretarded for some time.\r\n\r\nThus have I set this matter in the plainest light I could, that every\r\none may judge of the necessity, usefulness, and practicableness of this\r\nScheme: and I shall only add a few scattered hints, which, to me, seem\r\nnot altogether unprofitable.\r\n\r\nI think the prime minister for the time being ought largely to\r\ncontribute to such a foundation; because his high station and merits\r\nmust of necessity infect a great number with envy, hatred, lying, and\r\nsuch sort of distempers; and, of consequence, furnish the hospital\r\nannually with many incurables.\r\n\r\nI would desire that the governors appointed to direct this hospital,\r\nshould have (if such a thing were possible) some appearance of religion,\r\nand belief in God; because those who are to be admitted as incurable\r\ninfidels, atheists, deists, and freethinkers, most of which tribe are\r\nonly so out of pride, conceit, and affectation, might perhaps grow\r\ngradually into believers, if they perceived it to be the custom of the\r\nplace where they lived.\r\n\r\nAlthough it be not customary for the natives of Ireland to meet with any\r\nmanner of promotion in this kingdom, I would, in this respect, have that\r\nnational prejudice entirely laid aside; and request, that, for the\r\nreputation of both kingdoms, a _large_ apartment in the hospital may be\r\nfitted up for Irishmen particularly, who, either by knavery, lewdness,\r\nor fortune-hunting, should appear qualified for admittance; because\r\ntheir numbers would certainly be very considerable.\r\n\r\nI would further request, that a father, who seems delighted at seeing\r\nhis son metamorphosed into a fop, or a coxcomb, because he hath\r\ntravelled from London to Paris; may be sent along with the young\r\ngentleman to the hospital, as an old fool, absolutely incurable.\r\n\r\nIf a poet hath luckily produced anything, especially in the dramatic\r\nway, which is tolerably well received by the public, he should be sent\r\nimmediately to the hospital; because incurable vanity is always the\r\nconsequence of a little success. And, if his compositions be ill\r\nreceived, let him be admitted as a scribbler.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope, in regard to the great pains I have taken, about this\r\nScheme, that I shall be admitted upon the foundation, as one of the\r\nscribbling incurables. But, as an additional favour, I entreat, that I\r\nmay not be placed in an apartment with a poet who hath employed his\r\ngenius for the stage; because he will kill me with repeating his own\r\ncompositions: and I need not acquaint the world, that it is extremely\r\npainful to bear any nonsense--except our own.\r\n\r\nMy private reason for soliciting so early to be admitted is, because it\r\nis observed that schemers and projectors are generally reduced to\r\nbeggary; but, by my being provided for in the hospital, either as an\r\nincurable fool or a scribbler, that discouraging observation will for\r\nonce be publicly disproved, and my brethren in that way will be secure\r\nof a public reward for their labours.\r\n\r\nIt gives me, I own, a great degree of happiness, to reflect, that\r\nalthough in this short treatise the characters of many thousands are\r\ncontained, among the vast variety of incurables; yet, not any one person\r\nis likely to be offended; because, it is natural to apply ridiculous\r\ncharacters to all the world, except ourselves. And I dare be bold to\r\nsay, that the most incurable fool, knave, scold, coxcomb, scribbler, or\r\nliar, in this whole nation, will sooner enumerate the circle of their\r\nacquaintance as addicted to those distempers, than once imagine\r\n_themselves_ any way qualified for such an hospital.\r\n\r\nI hope, indeed, that our wise legislature will take this project into\r\ntheir serious consideration; and promote an endowment, which will be of\r\nsuch eminent service to multitudes of his Majesty's unprofitable\r\nsubjects, and may in time be of use to _themselves_ and their posterity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  From my Garret in Moorfields, Aug. 20, 1733.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONOURABLE\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, &c.\r\n\r\n_The Humble Petition of the Footmen in and about the City of Dublin._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Swift may have written the following mock petition by way of satire\r\n     against the many absurd petitions which were presented at the time\r\n     to the Irish House of Commons, and of which two examples were\r\n     quoted in the note to a previous tract.

Whereas they can be proved to be no\r\nbetter than common toupees,[182] as a judicious eye may soon discover by\r\ntheir awkward, clumsy, ungenteel gait and behaviour, by their\r\nunskilfulness in dress, even with the advantage of wearing our habits,\r\nby their ill-favoured countenances, with an air of impudence and dulness\r\npeculiar to the rest of their brethren; who have not yet arrived at that\r\ntranscendent pitch of assurance. Although, it may be justly apprehended,\r\nthat they will do so in time, if these counterfeits shall happen to\r\nsucceed in their evil design, of passing for real footmen, thereby to\r\nrender themselves more amiable to the ladies.\r\n\r\nYour petitioners do further allege, that many of the said counterfeits,\r\nupon a strict examination, have been found in the very act of strutting,\r\nswearing, staring, swaggering, in a manner that plainly shewed their\r\nbest endeavours to imitate us. Wherein, although they did not succeed,\r\nyet by their ignorant and ungainly way of copying our graces, the utmost\r\nindignity was endeavoured to be cast upon our whole profession.\r\n\r\nYour Petitioners do therefore make it their humble request, that this\r\nHonourable House, (to many of whom your Petitioners are nearly allied)\r\nwill please to take this grievance into your most serious consideration:\r\nHumbly submitting, whether it would not be proper, that certain officers\r\nmight, at the public charge, be employed to search for, and discover all\r\nsuch counterfeit footmen, and carry them before the next Justice of\r\nPeace; by whose warrant, upon the first conviction, they should be\r\nstripped of their coats, and oaken ornaments, and be set two hours in\r\nthe stocks. Upon the second conviction, besides stripping, be set six\r\nhours in the stocks, with a paper pinned on their breast signifying\r\ntheir crime, in large capital letters, and in the following words. \"A. B.\r\ncommonly called A. B.

It was not to be\r\n     expected that he would vote against his employer, be he never so\r\n     honest a man. Swift openly informs the freemen that the Drapier is\r\n     against this man. The Lord Mayor was elected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The text of this \"Advice\" is based on that given in the eighth\r\n     volume of Swift's Collected Works, issued in 1746. The Forster\r\n     Collection contains a made-up booklet of pp. 196-205, taken from a\r\n     volume of one of the collected editions.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE FREEMEN OF THE CITY OF DUBLIN, IN THE CHOICE OF A MEMBER\r\nTO REPRESENT THEM IN PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose few writers, who, since the death of Alderman Burton, have\r\nemployed their pens in giving advice to our citizens, how they should\r\nproceed in electing a new representative for the next sessions, having\r\nlaid aside their pens, I have reason to hope, that all true lovers of\r\ntheir country in general, and particularly those who have any regard for\r\nthe privileges and liberties of this great and ancient city, will think\r\na second, and a third time, before they come to a final determination\r\nupon what person they resolve to fix their choice.\r\n\r\nI am told, there are only two persons who set up for candidates; one is\r\nthe present Lord Mayor,[184] and the other, a gentleman of good esteem,\r\nan alderman of the city, a merchant of reputation, and possessed of a\r\nconsiderable office under the crown.[185] The question is, which of\r\nthese two persons it will be most for the advantage of the city to\r\nelect? I have but little acquaintance with either, so that my inquiries\r\nwill be very impartial, and drawn only from the general character and\r\nsituation of both.\r\n\r\nIn order to this, I must offer my countrymen and fellow-citizens some\r\nreasons why I think they ought to be more than ordinarily careful, at\r\nthis juncture, upon whom they bestow their votes.\r\n\r\nTo perform this with more clearness, it may be proper to give you a\r\nshort state of our unfortunate country.\r\n\r\nWe consist of two parties: I do not mean Popish and Protestant, High and\r\nLow Church, Episcopal and Sectarians, Whig and Tory; but of these\r\nEnglish who happen to be born in this kingdom, (whose ancestors reduced\r\nthe whole nation under the obedience of the English crown,) and the\r\ngentlemen sent from the other side to possess most of the chief\r\nemployments here. This latter party is very much enlarged and\r\nstrengthened by the whole power in the church, the law, the army, the\r\nrevenue, and the civil administration deposited in their hands;\r\nalthough, out of political ends, and to save appearances, some\r\nemployments are still deposited (yet gradually in a smaller number) to\r\npersons born here; this proceeding, fortified with good words and many\r\npromises, is sufficient to flatter and feed the hopes of hundreds, who\r\nwill never be one farthing the better, as they might easily be\r\nconvinced, if they were qualified to think at all.\r\n\r\nCivil employments of all kinds have been for several years past, with\r\ngreat prudence, made precarious, and during pleasure; by which means the\r\npossessors are, and must inevitably be, for ever dependent; yet those\r\nvery few of any consequence, which are dealt with so sparing a hand to\r\npersons born among us, are enough to keep hope alive in great numbers,\r\nwho desire to mend their condition by the favour of those in power.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear fellow-citizens, how is it possible you can conceive, that\r\nany person, who holds an office of some hundred pounds a year, which may\r\nbe taken from him whenever power shall think fit, will, if he should be\r\nchosen a member for any city, do the least thing, when he sits in the\r\nhouse, that he knows or fears may be displeasing to those who gave him\r\nor continue him in that office? Believe me, these are no times to expect\r\nsuch an exalted degree of virtue from mortal men. Blazing stars are much\r\nmore frequently seen than such heroical worthies. And I could sooner\r\nhope to find ten thousand pounds by digging in my garden, than such a\r\nphoenix, by searching among the present race of mankind.\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear thinking it a very erroneous, as well as modern maxim\r\nof politics, in the English nation, to take every opportunity of\r\ndepressing Ireland; whereof an hundred instances may be produced in\r\npoints of the highest importance, and within the memory of every\r\nmiddle-aged man; although many of the greatest persons among that party\r\nwhich now prevails, have formerly, upon that article, much differed in\r\ntheir opinion from their present successors.\r\n\r\nBut so the fact stands at present. It is plain that the court and\r\ncountry party here, (I mean in the House of Commons,) very seldom agree\r\nin anything but their loyalty to his present Majesty, their resolutions\r\nto make him and his viceroy easy in the government, to the utmost of\r\ntheir power, under the present condition of the kingdom. But the persons\r\nsent from England, who (to a trifle) are possessed of the sole executive\r\npower in all its branches, with their few adherents in possession who\r\nwere born here, and hundreds of expectants, hopers, and promissees, put\r\non quite contrary notions with regard to Ireland. They count upon a\r\nuniversal submission to whatever shall be demanded; wherein they act\r\nsafely, because none of themselves, except the candidates, feel the\r\nleast of our pressures.\r\n\r\nI remember a person of distinction some days ago affirmed in a good deal\r\nof mixed company, and of both parties, that the gentry from England, who\r\nnow enjoy our highest employments of all kinds, can never be possibly\r\nlosers of one farthing by the greatest calamities that can befall this\r\nkingdom, except a plague that would sweep away a million of our hewers\r\nof wood and drawers of water, or an invasion that would fright our\r\ngrandees out of the kingdom. For this person argued, that while there\r\nwas a penny left in the treasury, the civil and military list must be\r\npaid; and that the Episcopal revenues, which are usually farmed out at\r\nsix times below the real value, could hardly fail. He insisted farther,\r\nthat as money diminished, the price of all necessaries for life must of\r\nconsequence do so too, which would be for the advantage of all persons\r\nin employment, as well as of my lords the bishops, and to the ruin of\r\neverybody else. Among the company there wanted not men in office,\r\nbesides one or two expectants; yet I did not observe any of them\r\ndisposed to return an answer; but the consequences drawn were these:\r\nThat the great men in power sent hither from the other side, were by no\r\nmeans upon the same foot with his Majesty's other subjects of Ireland;\r\nthey had no common ligament to bind them with us; they suffered not with\r\nour sufferings; and if it were possible for us to have any cause of\r\nrejoicing, they could not rejoice with us.\r\n\r\nSuppose a person, born in this kingdom, shall happen by his services for\r\nthe English interest to have an employment conferred on him worth four\r\nhundred pounds a year; and that he hath likewise an estate in land worth\r\nfour hundred pounds a year more; suppose him to sit in Parliament; then,\r\nsuppose a land-tax to be brought in of five shillings a pound for ten\r\nyears; I tell you how this gentleman will compute. He hath four hundred\r\npounds a year in land: the tax he must pay yearly is one hundred pounds;\r\nby which, in ten years, he will pay only a thousand pounds. But if he\r\ngives his vote against this tax, he will lose four thousand pounds by\r\nbeing turned out of his employment, together with the power and\r\ninfluence he hath, by virtue or colour of his employment; and thus the\r\nbalance will be against him three thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nI desire, my fellow-citizens, you will please to call to mind how many\r\npersons you can vouch for among your acquaintance, who have so much\r\nvirtue and self-denial as to lose four hundred pounds a year for life,\r\ntogether with the smiles and favour of power, and the hopes of higher\r\nadvancement, merely out of a generous love of his country.\r\n\r\nThe contentions of parties in England are very different from those\r\namong us. The battle there is fought for power and riches; and so it is\r\nindeed among us: but whether a great employment be given to Tom or to\r\nPeter, they were both born in England, the profits are to be spent\r\nthere. All employments (except a very few) are bestowed on the natives;\r\nthey do not send to Germany, Holland, Sweden, or Denmark, much less to\r\nIreland, for chancellors, bishops, judges, or other officers. Their\r\nsalaries, whether well or ill got, are employed at home: and whatever\r\ntheir morals or politics be, the nation is not the poorer.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons in England have frequently endeavoured to limit the\r\nnumber of members, who should be allowed to have employments under the\r\nCrown. Several acts have been made to that purpose, which many wise men\r\nthink are not yet effectual enough, and many of them are rendered\r\nineffectual by leaving the power of re-election. Our House of Commons\r\nconsists, I think, of about three hundred members; if one hundred of\r\nthese should happen to be made up of persons already provided for,\r\njoined with expecters, compliers easy to be persuaded, such as will give\r\na vote for a friend who is in hopes to get something; if they be merry\r\ncompanions, without suspicion, of a natural bashfulness, not apt or able\r\nto look forwards; if good words, smiles, and caresses, have any power\r\nover them, the larger part of a second hundred may be very easily\r\nbrought in at a most reasonable rate.\r\n\r\nThere is an Englishman[186] of no long standing among us, but in an\r\nemployment of great trust, power, and profit. This excellent person did\r\nlately publish, at his own expense, a pamphlet printed in England by\r\nauthority, to justify the bill for a general excise or inland duty, in\r\norder to introduce that blessed scheme among us. What a tender care must\r\nsuch an English patriot for Ireland have of our interest, if he should\r\ncondescend to sit in our Parliament! I will bridle my indignation.\r\nHowever, methinks I long to see that mortal, who would with pleasure\r\nblow us all up at a blast: but he duly receives his thousand pounds a\r\nyear; makes his progresses like a king; is received in pomp at every\r\ntown and village where he travels,[187] and shines in the English\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nI will now apply what I have said to you, my brethren and\r\nfellow-citizens. Count upon it, as a truth next to your creed, that no\r\none person in office, of which he is not master for life, whether born\r\nhere or in England, will ever hazard that office for the good of this\r\ncountry. One of your candidates is of this kind, and I believe him to be\r\nan honest gentleman, as the word honest is generally understood. But he\r\nloves his employment better than he doth you, or his country, or all the\r\ncountries upon earth. Will you contribute and give him city security to\r\npay him the value of his employment, if it should be taken from him,\r\nduring his life, for voting on all occasions with the honest country\r\nparty in the House?--although I must question, whether he would do it\r\neven upon that condition.\r\n\r\nWherefore, since there are but two candidates, I entreat you will fix on\r\nthe present Lord Mayor. He hath shewn more virtue, more activity, more\r\nskill, in one year's government of the city, than a hundred years can\r\nequal. He hath endeavoured, with great success, to banish frauds,\r\ncorruptions, and all other abuses from amongst you.\r\n\r\nA dozen such men in power would be able to reform a kingdom. He hath no\r\nemployment under the Crown; nor is likely to get or solicit for any: his\r\neducation having not turned him that way. I will assure for no man's\r\nfuture conduct; but he who hath hitherto practised the rules of virtue\r\nwith so much difficulty in so great and busy a station, deserves your\r\nthanks, and the best return you can make him; and you, my brethren, have\r\nno other to give him, than that of representing you in Parliament. Tell\r\nme not of your engagements and promises to another: your promises were\r\nsins of inconsideration, at best; and you are bound to repent and annul\r\nthem. That gentleman, although with good reputation, is already engaged\r\non the other side. He hath four hundred pounds a year under the Crown,\r\nwhich he is too wise to part with, by sacrificing so good an\r\nestablishment to the empty names of virtue, and love of his country. I\r\ncan assure you, the DRAPIER is in the interest of the present\r\nLord Mayor, whatever you may be told to the contrary. I have lately\r\nheard him declare so in public company, and offer some of these very\r\nreasons in defence of his opinion; although he hath a regard and esteem\r\nfor the other gentleman, but would not hazard the good of the city and\r\nthe kingdom for a compliment.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor's severity to some unfair dealers, should not turn the\r\nhonest men among them against him. Whatever he did, was for the\r\nadvantage of those very traders, whose dishonest members he punished. He\r\nhath hitherto been above temptation to act wrong; and therefore, as\r\nmankind goes, he is the most likely to act right as a representative of\r\nyour city, as he constantly did in the government of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nHUMBLY OFFERED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, THE COURT OF\r\nALDERMEN, AND COMMON-COUNCIL OF THE HONOURABLE CITY OF DUBLIN,\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF A RECORDER.\r\n\r\n1733.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CHOICE OF A RECORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe office of Recorder to this city being vacant by the death of a very\r\nworthy gentleman,[188] it is said, that five or six persons are\r\nsoliciting to succeed him in the employment. I am a stranger to all\r\ntheir persons, and to most of their characters; which latter, I hope,\r\nwill at this time be canvassed with more decency than it sometimes\r\nhappeneth upon the like occasions. Therefore, as I am wholly impartial,\r\nI can with more freedom deliver my thoughts how the several persons and\r\nparties concerned ought to proceed in electing a Recorder for this great\r\nand ancient city.\r\n\r\nAnd first, as it is a very natural, so I can by no means think it an\r\nunreasonable opinion, that the sons or near relations of Aldermen, and\r\nother deserving citizens, should be duly regarded as proper competitors\r\nfor an employment in the city's disposal, provided they be equally\r\nqualified with other candidates; and provided that such employments\r\nrequire no more than common abilities, and common honesty. But in the\r\nchoice of a Recorder, the case is entirely different. He ought to be a\r\nperson of good abilities in his calling; of an unspotted character; an\r\nable practitioner; one who hath occasionally merited of this city\r\nbefore; he ought to be of some maturity in years; a member of\r\nParliament, and likely to continue so; regular in his life; firm in his\r\nloyalty to the Hanover succession; indulgent to tender consciences; but,\r\nat the same time, a firm adherer to the established church. If he be\r\nsuch a one who hath already sat in Parliament, it ought to be inquired\r\nof what weight he was there; whether he voted on all occasions for the\r\ngood of his country; and particularly for advancing the trade and\r\nfreedom of this city; whether he be engaged in any faction, either\r\nnational or religious; and, lastly, whether he be a man of courage, not\r\nto be drawn from his duty by the frown or menaces of power, nor capable\r\nto be corrupted by allurements or bribes.--These, and many other\r\nparticulars, are of infinitely more consequence, than that single\r\ncircumstance of being descended by a direct or collateral line from any\r\nAlderman, or distinguished citizen, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThere is not a dealer or shopkeeper in this city, of any substance,\r\nwhose thriving, less or more, may not depend upon the good or ill\r\nconduct of a Recorder. He is to watch every motion in Parliament that\r\nmay the least affect the freedom, trade, or welfare of it.\r\n\r\nIn this approaching election, the commons, as they are a numerous body,\r\nso they seem to be most concerned in point of interest; and their\r\ninterest ought to be most regarded, because it altogether dependeth upon\r\nthe true interest of the city. They have no private views; and giving\r\ntheir votes, as I am informed, by balloting, they lie under no awe, or\r\nfear of disobliging competitors. It is therefore hoped that they will\r\nduly consider, which of the candidates is most likely to advance the\r\ntrade of themselves and their brother-citizens; to defend their\r\nliberties, both in and out of Parliament, against all attempts of\r\nencroachment or oppression. And so God direct them in the choice of a\r\nRecorder, who may for many years supply that important office with\r\nskill, diligence, courage, and fidelity. And let all the people say,\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nFOR GIVING\r\n\r\nBADGES TO THE BEGGARS IN ALL THE PARISHES OF DUBLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The \"badging\" of beggars was a favourite scheme of Swift's for the\r\n     better regulation of the many who infested the city of Dublin as\r\n     tramps and idlers. While many of these were really deserving\r\n     persons, there were a great many also who made the business of\r\n     begging a profession. Eleven years before this tract was printed\r\n     Swift wrote to Archbishop King on the same subject, as will be seen\r\n     from the letter quoted in the note on pages 326-327.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The present text is based on the original edition of 1737 collated\r\n     with that given by Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL\r\n\r\nFOR GIVING\r\n\r\nBADGES\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nBEGGARS\r\n\r\nIN ALL THE\r\n\r\nPARISHES of _DUBLIN_.\r\n\r\nBY THE\r\n\r\nDEAN of St. _PATRICK's_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_LONDON_,\r\n\r\nPrinted for T. COOPER at the _Globe_ in _Pater Noster Row_.\r\n\r\nMDCCXXXVII.\r\n\r\nPrice Six Pence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hath been a general complaint, that the poor-house, especially since\r\nthe new Constitution by Act of Parliament, hath been of no benefit to\r\nthis city, for the ease of which it was wholly intended. I had the\r\nhonour to be a member of it many years before it was new modelled by the\r\nlegislature, not from any personal regard, but merely as one of the two\r\ndeans, who are of course put into most commissions that relate to the\r\ncity; and I have likewise the honour to have been left out of several\r\ncommissions upon the score of party, in which my predecessors, time out\r\nof mind, have always been members.\r\n\r\nThe first commission was made up of about fifty persons, which were the\r\nLord Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, and some few other citizens; the\r\nJudges, the two Archbishops, the two Deans of the city, and one or two\r\nmore gentlemen. And I must confess my opinion, that the dissolving the\r\nold commission, and establishing a new one of nearly three times the\r\nnumber, have been the great cause of rendering so good a design not only\r\nuseless, but a grievance instead of a benefit to the city. In the\r\npresent commission all the city clergy are included, besides a great\r\nnumber of 'squires, not only those who reside in Dublin, and the\r\nneighbourhood, but several who live at a great distance, and cannot\r\npossibly have the least concern for the advantage of the city.\r\n\r\nAt the few general meetings that I have attended since the new\r\nEstablishment, I observed very little was done, except one or two Acts\r\nof extreme justice, which I then thought might as well have been\r\nspared: and I have found the Court of Assistants usually taken up in\r\nlittle brangles about coachmen, or adjusting accounts of meal and small\r\nbeer; which, however necessary, might sometimes have given place to\r\nmatters of much greater moment, I mean some schemes recommended to the\r\nGeneral Board, for answering the chief ends in erecting and establishing\r\nsuch a poor-house, and endowing it with so considerable a revenue: and\r\nthe principal end I take to have been that of maintaining the poor and\r\norphans of the city, where the parishes are not able to do it; and\r\nclearing the streets from all strollers, foreigners, and sturdy beggars,\r\nwith which, to the universal complaint and admiration, Dublin is more\r\ninfested since the Establishment of the poor-house, than it was ever\r\nknown to be since its first erection.\r\n\r\nAs the whole fund for supporting this hospital is raised only from the\r\ninhabitants of the city, so there can be hardly any thing more absurd,\r\nthan to see it mis-employed in maintaining foreign beggars and bastards,\r\nor orphans, whose country landlords never contributed one shilling\r\ntowards their support. I would engage, that half this revenue, if\r\nemployed with common care, and no very great degree of common honesty,\r\nwould maintain all the real objects of charity in this city, except a\r\nsmall number of original poor in every parish, who might, without being\r\nburthensome to the parishioners, find a tolerable support.\r\n\r\nI have for some years past applied myself to several Lord Mayors, and to\r\nthe late Archbishop of Dublin[189], for a remedy to this evil of foreign\r\nbeggars; and they all appeared ready to receive a very plain proposal, I\r\nmean, that of badging the original poor of every parish, who begged in\r\nthe streets;[190] that the said beggars should be confined to their own\r\nparishes; that, they should wear their badges well sewn upon one of\r\ntheir shoulders, always visible, on pain of being whipped and turned out\r\nof town; or whatever legal punishment may be thought proper and\r\neffectual. But, by the wrong way of thinking in some clergymen, and the\r\nindifference of others, this method was perpetually defeated, to their\r\nown continual disquiet, which they do not ill deserve; and if the\r\ngrievance affected only them, it would be of less consequence, because\r\nthe remedy is in their own power. But all street-walkers, and\r\nshopkeepers bear an equal share in this hourly vexation.\r\n\r\nI never heard more than one objection against this expedient of badging\r\nthe poor, and confining their walks to their several parishes. The\r\nobjection was this: What shall we do with the foreign beggars? Must they\r\nbe left to starve? I answered, No; but they must be driven or whipped\r\nout of town; and let the next country parish do as they please; or\r\nrather after the practice in England, send them from one parish to\r\nanother, until they reach their own homes. By the old laws of England\r\nstill in force, and I presume by those of Ireland, every parish is bound\r\nto maintain its own poor; and the matter is of no such consequence in\r\nthis point as some would make it, whether a country parish be rich or\r\npoor. In the remoter and poorer parishes of the kingdom, all necessaries\r\nfor life proper for poor people are comparatively cheaper; I mean\r\nbutter-milk, oatmeal, potatoes, and other vegetables; and every farmer\r\nor cottager, who is not himself a beggar, can sometimes spare a sup or a\r\nmorsel, not worth the fourth part of a farthing, to an indigent\r\nneighbour of his own parish, who is disabled from work. A beggar native\r\nof the parish is known to the 'squire, to the church minister, to the\r\npopish priest, or the conventicle teachers, as well as to every farmer:\r\nhe hath generally some relations able to live, and contribute something\r\nto his maintenance. None of which advantages can be reasonably expected\r\non a removal to places where he is altogether unknown. If he be not\r\nquite maimed, he and his trull, and litter of brats (if he hath any) may\r\nget half their support by doing some kind of work in their power, and\r\nthereby be less burthensome to the people. In short, all necessaries of\r\nlife grow in the country, and not in cities, and are cheaper where they\r\ngrow; nor is it equal, that beggars should put us to the charge of\r\ngiving them victuals, and the carriage too.\r\n\r\nBut, when the spirit of wandering takes him, attended by his female, and\r\ntheir equipage of children, he becomes a nuisance to the whole country:\r\nhe and his female are thieves, and teach the trade of stealing to their\r\nbrood at four years old; and if his infirmities be counterfeit, it is\r\ndangerous for a single person unarmed to meet him on the road. He\r\nwanders from one county to another, but still with a view to this town,\r\nwhither he arrives at last, and enjoys all the privileges of a Dublin\r\nbeggar.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that the country 'squires should be very willing to send\r\nup their colonies; but why the city should be content to receive them,\r\nis beyond my imagination.\r\n\r\nIf the city were obliged by their charter to maintain a thousand\r\nbeggars, they could do it cheaper by eighty _per cent._ a hundred miles\r\noff, than in this town, or any of its suburbs.\r\n\r\nThere is no village in Connaught, that in proportion shares so deeply in\r\nthe daily increasing miseries of Ireland, as its capital city; to which\r\nmiseries there hardly remained any addition, except the perpetual swarms\r\nof foreign beggars, who might be banished in a month without expense,\r\nand with very little trouble.\r\n\r\nAs I am personally acquainted with a great number of street beggars, I\r\nfind some weak attempts to have been made in one or two parishes to\r\npromote the wearing of badges; and my first question to those who ask an\r\nalms, is, _Where is your badge?_ I have in several years met with about\r\na dozen who were ready to produce them, some out of their pockets,\r\nothers from under their coat, and two or three on their shoulders, only\r\ncovered with a sort of capes which they could lift up or let down upon\r\noccasion. They are too lazy to work, they are not afraid to steal, nor\r\nashamed to beg; and yet are too proud to be seen with a badge, as many\r\nof them have confessed to me, and not a few in very injurious terms,\r\nparticularly the females. They all look upon such an obligation as a\r\nhigh indignity done to their office. I appeal to all indifferent people,\r\nwhether such wretches deserve to be relieved. As to myself, I must\r\nconfess, this absurd insolence hath so affected me, that for several\r\nyears past, I have not disposed of one single farthing to a street\r\nbeggar, nor intend to do so, until I see a better regulation; and I have\r\nendeavoured to persuade all my brother-walkers to follow my example,\r\nwhich most of them assure me they do. For, if beggary be not able to\r\nbeat out pride, it cannot deserve charity. However, as to persons in\r\ncoaches and chairs, they bear but little of the persecution we suffer,\r\nand are willing to leave it entirely upon us.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, there is not a more undeserving vicious race of human\r\nkind than the bulk of those who are reduced to beggary, even in this\r\nbeggarly country. For, as a great part of our publick miseries is\r\noriginally owing to our own faults (but, what those faults are I am\r\ngrown by experience too wary to mention) so I am confident, that among\r\nthe meaner people, nineteen in twenty of those who are reduced to a\r\nstarving condition, did not become so by what lawyers call the work of\r\nGOD, either upon their bodies or goods; but merely from their\r\nown idleness, attended with all manner of vices, particularly\r\ndrunkenness, thievery, and cheating.\r\n\r\nWhoever enquires, as I have frequently done, from those who have asked\r\nme an alms; what was their former course of life, will find them to have\r\nbeen servants in good families, broken tradesmen, labourers, cottagers,\r\nand what they call decayed house-keepers; but (to use their own cant)\r\nreduced by losses and crosses, by which nothing can be understood but\r\nidleness and vice.\r\n\r\nAs this is the only Christian country where people contrary to the old\r\nmaxim, are the poverty and not the riches of the nation, so, the\r\nblessing of increase and multiply is by us converted into a curse; and,\r\nas marriage hath been ever countenanced in all free countries, so we\r\nshould be less miserable if it were discouraged in ours, as far as can\r\nbe consistent with Christianity. It is seldom known in England, that the\r\nlabourer, the lower mechanick, the servant, or the cottager thinks of\r\nmarrying until he hath saved up a stock of money sufficient to carry on\r\nhis business; nor takes a wife without a suitable portion; and as seldom\r\nfails of making a yearly addition to that stock, with a view of\r\nproviding for his children. But, in this kingdom, the case is directly\r\ncontrary, where many thousand couples are yearly married, whose whole\r\nunited fortunes, bating the rags on their backs, would not be sufficient\r\nto purchase a pint of butter-milk for their wedding supper, nor have any\r\nprospect of supporting their _honourable state_, but by service, or\r\nlabour, or thievery. Nay, their _happiness_ is often deferred until they\r\nfind credit to borrow, or cunning to steal a shilling to pay their\r\nPopish priest, or infamous couple-beggar. Surely no miraculous portion\r\nof wisdom would be required to find some kind of remedy against this\r\ndestructive evil, or at least, not to draw the consequences of it upon\r\nour decaying city; the greatest part whereof must of course in a few\r\nyears become desolate, or in ruins.\r\n\r\nIn all other nations, that are not absolutely barbarous, parents think\r\nthemselves bound by the law of nature and reason to make some provision\r\nfor their children; but the reasons offered by the inhabitants of\r\nIreland for marrying is, that they may have children to maintain them\r\nwhen they grow old and unable to work.\r\n\r\nI am informed that we have been for some time past extremely obliged to\r\nEngland for one very beneficial branch of commerce: for, it seems they\r\nare grown so gracious as to transmit us continually colonies of beggars,\r\nin return of a million of money they receive yearly from hence. That I\r\nmay give no offence, I profess to mean real English beggars in the\r\nliteral meaning of the word, as it is usually understood by protestants.\r\nIt seems, the Justices of the Peace and parish officers in the western\r\ncoasts of England, have a good while followed the trade of exporting\r\nhither their supernumerary beggars, in order to advance the English\r\nProtestant interest among us; and, these they are so kind to send over\r\n_gratis_, and duty free. I have had the honour more than once to attend\r\nlarge cargoes of them from Chester to Dublin: and I was then so ignorant\r\nas to give my opinion, that our city should receive them into\r\n_bridewell_, and after a month's residence, having been well whipped\r\ntwice a day, fed with bran and water, and put to hard labour, they\r\nshould be returned honestly back with thanks as cheap as they came: or,\r\nif that were not approved of, I proposed, that whereas one English man\r\nis allowed to be of equal intrinsic value with twelve born in Ireland,\r\nwe should in justice return them a dozen for one, to dispose of as they\r\npleased. But to return.\r\n\r\nAs to the native poor of this city, there would be little or no damage\r\nin confining them to their several parishes. For instance; a beggar of\r\nthe parish of St. Warborough's,[191] or any other parish here, if he be\r\nan object of compassion, hath an equal chance to receive his proportion\r\nof alms from every charitable hand; because the inhabitants, one or\r\nother, walk through every street in town, and give their alms, without\r\nconsidering the place, wherever they think it may be well disposed of:\r\nand these helps, added to what they get in eatables by going from house\r\nto house among the gentry and citizens, will, without being very\r\nburthensome, be sufficient to keep them alive.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the poor of the suburb parishes will not have altogether the\r\nsame advantage, because they are not equally in the road of business and\r\npassengers: but here it is to be considered, that the beggars there have\r\nnot so good a title to publick charity, because most of them are\r\nstrollers from the country, and compose a principal part of that great\r\nnuisance, which we ought to remove.\r\n\r\nI should be apt to think, that few things can be more irksome to a city\r\nminister, than a number of beggars which do not belong to his district,\r\nwhom he hath no obligation to take care of, who are no part of his\r\nflock, and who take the bread out of the mouths of those, to whom it\r\nproperly belongs. When I mention this abuse to any minister of a\r\ncity-parish, he usually lays the fault upon the beadles, who he says are\r\nbribed by the foreign beggars; and, as those beadles often keep\r\nale-houses, they find their account in such customers. This evil might\r\neasily be remedied, if the parishes would make some small addition to\r\nthe salaries of a beadle, and be more careful in the choice of those\r\nofficers. But, I conceive there is one effectual method, in the power of\r\nevery minister to put in practice; I mean, by making it the interest of\r\nall his own original poor, to drive out intruders: for, if the\r\nparish-beggars were absolutely forbidden by the minister and\r\nchurch-officers, to suffer strollers to come into the parish, upon pain\r\nof themselves not being permitted to beg alms at the church-doors, or at\r\nthe houses and shops of the inhabitants; they would prevent interlopers\r\nmore effectually than twenty beadles.\r\n\r\nAnd, here I cannot but take notice of the great indiscretion in our\r\ncity-shopkeepers, who suffer their doors to be daily besieged by crowds\r\nof beggars, (as the gates of a lord are by duns,) to the great disgust\r\nand vexation of many customers, whom I have frequently observed to go to\r\nother shops, rather than suffer such a persecution; which might easily\r\nbe avoided, if no foreign beggars were allowed to infest them.\r\n\r\nWherefore, I do assert, that the shopkeepers, who are the greatest\r\ncomplainers of this grievance, lamenting that for every customer, they\r\nare worried by fifty beggars, do very well deserve what they suffer,\r\nwhen a 'prentice with a horse-whip is able to lash every beggar from the\r\nshop, who is not of the parish, and does not wear the badge of that\r\nparish on his shoulder, well fastened and fairly visible; and if this\r\npractice were universal in every house to all the sturdy vagrants, we\r\nshould in a few weeks clear the town of all mendicants, except those who\r\nhave a proper title to our charity: as for the aged and infirm, it would\r\nbe sufficient to give them nothing, and then they must starve or follow\r\ntheir brethren.\r\n\r\nIt was the city that first endowed this hospital, and those who\r\nafterwards contributed, as they were such who generally inhabited here;\r\nso they intended what they gave to be for the use of the city's poor.\r\nThe revenues which have since been raised by parliament, are wholly paid\r\nby the city, without the least charge upon any other part of the\r\nkingdom; and therefore nothing could more defeat the original design,\r\nthan to misapply those revenues on strolling beggars, or bastards from\r\nthe country, which bear no share in the charges we are at.\r\n\r\nIf some of the out-parishes be overburthened with poor, the reason must\r\nbe, that the greatest part of those poor are strollers from the country,\r\nwho nestle themselves where they can find the cheapest lodgings, and\r\nfrom thence infest every part of the town, out of which they ought to be\r\nwhipped as a most insufferable nuisance, being nothing else but a\r\nprofligate clan of thieves, drunkards, heathens, and whore-mongers,\r\nfitter to be rooted out of the face of the earth, than suffered to levy\r\na vast annual tax upon the city, which shares too deep in the public\r\nmiseries, brought on us by the oppressions we lye under from our\r\nneighbours, our brethren, our countrymen, our fellow protestants, and\r\nfellow subjects.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I was appointed one of a committee to inquire into the\r\nstate of the workhouse; where we found that a charity was bestowed by a\r\ngreat person for a certain time, which in its consequences operated\r\nvery much to the detriment of the house: for, when the time was elapsed,\r\nall those who were supported by that charity, continued on the same foot\r\nwith the rest of the foundation; and being generally a pack of\r\nprofligate vagabond wretches from several parts of the kingdom,\r\ncorrupted all the rest; so partial, or treacherous, or interested, or\r\nignorant, or mistaken are generally all recommenders, not only to\r\nemployments, but even to charity itself.\r\n\r\nI know it is complained, that the difficulty of driving foreign beggars\r\nout of the city is charged upon the _bellowers_ (as they are called) who\r\nfind their accounts best in suffering those vagrants to follow their\r\ntrade through every part of the town. But this abuse might easily be\r\nremedied, and very much to the advantage of the whole city, if better\r\nsalaries were given to those who execute that office in the several\r\nparishes, and would make it their interest to clear the town of those\r\ncaterpillars, rather than hazard the loss of an employment that would\r\ngive them an honest livelyhood. But, if that would fail, yet a general\r\nresolution of never giving charity to a street beggar out of his own\r\nparish, or without a visible badge, would infallibly force all vagrants\r\nto depart.\r\n\r\nThere is generally a vagabond spirit in beggars, which ought to be\r\ndiscouraged and severely punished. It is owing to the same causes that\r\ndrove them into poverty; I mean, idleness, drunkenness, and rash\r\nmarriages without the least prospect of supporting a family by honest\r\nendeavours, which never came into their thoughts. It is observed, that\r\nhardly one beggar in twenty looks upon himself to be relieved by\r\nreceiving bread or other food; and they have in this town been\r\nfrequently seen to pour out of their pitcher good broth that hath been\r\ngiven them, into the kennel; neither do they much regard clothes, unless\r\nto sell them; for their rags are part of their tools with which they\r\nwork: they want only ale, brandy, and other strong liquors, which cannot\r\nbe had without money; and, money as they conceive, always abounds in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nI had some other thoughts to offer upon this subject. But, as I am a\r\ndesponder in my nature, and have tolerably well discovered the\r\ndisposition of our people, who never will move a step towards easing\r\nthemselves from any one single grievance; it will be thought, that I\r\nhave already said too much, and to little or no purpose; which hath\r\noften been the fate, or fortune of the writer,\r\n\r\n                                                      J. SWIFT.\r\n\r\n  April 22,\r\n   1737.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nABOUT MAINTAINING THE POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The text of this short paper is taken from Deane Swift's edition,\r\n     which was followed by Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS ABOUT MAINTAINING THE POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been amused, for at least thirty years past, with numberless\r\nschemes, in writing and discourse, both in and out of Parliament, for\r\nmaintaining the poor, and setting them to work, especially in this city:\r\nmost of which were idle, indigested, or visionary; and all of them\r\nineffectual, as it has plainly appeared by the consequences. Many of\r\nthose projectors were so stupid, that they drew a parallel from Holland\r\nto England, to be settled in Ireland; that is to say, from two countries\r\nwith full freedom and encouragement for trade, to a third where all kind\r\nof trade is cramped, and the most beneficial parts are entirely taken\r\naway. But the perpetual infelicity of false and foolish reasoning, as\r\nwell as proceeding and acting upon it, seems to be fatal to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, who have much conversed with those folks who call\r\nthemselves merchants, I do not remember to have met with a more ignorant\r\nand wrong-thinking race of people in the very first rudiments of trade;\r\nwhich, however, was not so much owing to their want of capacity, as to\r\nthe crazy constitution of this kingdom, where pedlars are better\r\nqualified to thrive than the wisest merchants. I could fill a volume\r\nwith only setting down a list of the public absurdities, by which this\r\nkingdom has suffered within the compass of my own memory, such as could\r\nnot be believed of any nation, among whom folly was not established as a\r\nlaw. I cannot forbear instancing a few of these, because it may be of\r\nsome use to those who shall have it in their power to be more cautious\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nThe first was, the building of the barracks; whereof I have seen above\r\none-half, and have heard enough of the rest, to affirm that the public\r\nhas been cheated of at least two-thirds of the money raised for that\r\nuse, by the plain fraud of the undertakers.\r\n\r\nAnother was the management of the money raised for the Palatines; when,\r\ninstead of employing that great sum in purchasing lands in some remote\r\nand cheap part of the kingdom, and there planting those people as a\r\ncolony, the whole end was utterly defeated.\r\n\r\nA third is, the insurance office against fire, by which several thousand\r\npounds are yearly remitted to England, (a trifle, it seems, we can\r\neasily spare,) and will gradually increase until it comes to a good\r\nnational tax: for the society-marks upon our houses (under which might\r\nproperly be written, \"The Lord have mercy upon us!\") spread faster and\r\nfarther than the colony of frogs.[192] I have, for above twenty years\r\npast, given warning several thousand times to many substantial people,\r\nand to such who are acquainted with lords and squires, and the like\r\ngreat folks, to any of whom I have not the honour to be known: I\r\nmentioned my daily fears, lest our watchful friends in England might\r\ntake this business out of our hands; and how easy it would be to prevent\r\nthat evil, by erecting a society of persons who had good estates, such,\r\nfor instance, as that noble knot of bankers, under the style of \"Swift\r\nand Company.\" But now we are become tributary to England, not only for\r\nmaterials to light our own fires, but for engines to put them out; to\r\nwhich, if hearth-money be added, (repealed in England as a grievance,)\r\nwe have the honour to pay three taxes for fire.\r\n\r\nA fourth was the knavery of those merchants, or linen-manufacturers, or\r\nboth, when, upon occasion of the plague at Marseilles, we had a fair\r\nopportunity of getting into our hands the whole linen-trade of Spain;\r\nbut the commodity was so bad, and held at so high a rate, that almost\r\nthe whole cargo was returned, and the small remainder sold below the\r\nprime cost.\r\n\r\nSo many other particulars of the same nature crowd into my thoughts,\r\nthat I am forced to stop; and the rather because they are not very\r\nproper for my subject, to which I shall now return.\r\n\r\nAmong all the schemes for maintaining the poor of the city, and setting\r\nthem to work, the least weight has been laid upon that single point\r\nwhich is of the greatest importance; I mean, that of keeping foreign\r\nbeggars from swarming hither out of every part of the country; for,\r\nuntil this be brought to pass effectually, all our wise reasonings and\r\nproceedings upon them will be vain and ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious number of beggars throughout this kingdom, in proportion\r\nto so small a number of people, is owing to many reasons: to the\r\nlaziness of the natives; the want of work to employ them; the enormous\r\nrents paid by cottagers for their miserable cabins and potatoe-plots;\r\ntheir early marriages, without the least prospect of establishment; the\r\nruin of agriculture, whereby such vast numbers are hindered from\r\nproviding their own bread, and have no money to purchase it; the mortal\r\ndamp upon all kinds of trade, and many other circumstances, too tedious\r\nor invidious to mention.\r\n\r\nAnd to the same causes we owe the perpetual concourse of foreign beggars\r\nto this town, the country landlords giving all assistance, except money\r\nand victuals, to drive from their estates those miserable creatures they\r\nhave undone.\r\n\r\nIt was a general complaint against the poor-house, under its former\r\ngovernors, \"That the number of poor in this city did not lessen by\r\ntaking three hundred into the house, and all of them recommended under\r\nthe minister's and churchwardens' hands of the several parishes\": and\r\nthis complaint must still continue, although the poor-house should be\r\nenlarged to contain three thousand, or even double that number.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the poor-house, as it is now established, amount to\r\nabout two thousand pounds a-year; whereof two hundred allowed for\r\nofficers, and one hundred for repairs, the remaining seventeen hundred,\r\nat four pounds a-head, will support four hundred and twenty-five\r\npersons. This is a favourable allowance, considering that I subtract\r\nnothing for the diet of those officers, and for wear and tear of\r\nfurniture; and if every one of these collegiates should be set to work,\r\nit is agreed they will not be able to gain by their labour above\r\none-fourth part of their maintenance.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the oratorial part of these gentlemen seldom vouchsafe\r\nto mention fewer than fifteen hundred or two thousand people, to be\r\nmaintained in this hospital, without troubling their heads about the\r\nfund. * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BARBAROUS DENOMINATIONS\r\n\r\nIN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been lately looking over the advertisements in some of your\r\nDublin newspapers, which are sent me to the country, and was much\r\nentertained with a large list of denominations of lands, to be sold or\r\nlet. I am confident they must be genuine; for it is impossible that\r\neither chance or modern invention could sort the alphabet in such a\r\nmanner as to make those abominable sounds; whether first invented to\r\ninvoke or fright away the devil, I must leave among the curious.\r\n\r\nIf I could wonder at anything barbarous, ridiculous, or absurd, among\r\nus, this should be one of the first. I have often lamented that\r\nAgricola, the father-in-law of Tacitus, was not prevailed on by that\r\npetty king from Ireland, who followed his camp, to come over and\r\ncivilize us with a conquest, as his countrymen did Britain, where\r\nseveral Roman appellations remain to this day, and so would the rest\r\nhave done, if that inundation of Angles, Saxons, and other northern\r\npeople, had not changed them so much for the worse, although in no\r\ncomparison with ours. In one of the advertisements just mentioned, I\r\nencountered near a hundred words together, which I defy any creature in\r\nhuman shape, except an Irishman of the savage kind, to pronounce;\r\nneither would I undertake such a task, to be owner of the lands, unless\r\nI had liberty to humanize the syllables twenty miles round. The\r\nlegislature may think what they please, and that they are above copying\r\nthe Romans in all their conquests of barbarous nations; but I am\r\ndeceived, if anything has more contributed to prevent the Irish from\r\nbeing tamed, than this encouragement of their language, which might be\r\neasily abolished, and become a dead one in half an age, with little\r\nexpense, and less trouble.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible that a gentleman who lives in those parts where the\r\n_town-lands_ (as they call them) of his estate produce such odious\r\nsounds from the mouth, the throat, and the nose, can be able to repeat\r\nthe words without dislocating every muscle that is used in speaking, and\r\nwithout applying the same tone to all other words, in every language he\r\nunderstands; as it is plainly to be observed not only in those people of\r\nthe better sort who live in Galway and the Western parts, but in most\r\ncounties of Ireland?\r\n\r\nIt is true, that, in the city parts of London, the trading people have\r\nan affected manner of pronouncing; and so, in my time, had many ladies\r\nand coxcombs at Court. It is likewise true, that there is an odd\r\nprovincial cant in most counties in England, sometimes not very pleasing\r\nto the ear; and the Scotch cadence, as well as expression, are offensive\r\nenough. But none of these defects derive contempt to the speaker:\r\nwhereas, what we call the _Irish brogue_ is no sooner discovered, than\r\nit makes the deliverer in the last degree ridiculous and despised; and,\r\nfrom such a mouth, an Englishman expects nothing but bulls, blunders,\r\nand follies. Neither does it avail whether the censure be reasonable or\r\nnot, since the fact is always so. And, what is yet worse, it is too well\r\nknown, that the bad consequence of this opinion affects those among us\r\nwho are not the least liable to such reproaches, farther than the\r\nmisfortune of being born in Ireland, although of English parents, and\r\nwhose education has been chiefly in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nI have heard many gentlemen among us talk much of the great convenience\r\nto those who live in the country, that they should speak Irish. It may\r\npossibly be so; but I think they should be such who never intend to\r\nvisit England, upon pain of being ridiculous; for I do not remember to\r\nhave heard of any one man that spoke Irish, who had not the accent upon\r\nhis tongue easily discernible to any English ear.\r\n\r\nBut I have wandered a little from my subject, which was only to propose\r\na wish that these execrable denominations were a little better suited to\r\nan English mouth, if it were only for the sake of the English lawyers;\r\nwho, in trials upon appeals to the House of Lords, find so much\r\ndifficulty in repeating the names, that, if the plaintiff or defendant\r\nwere by, they would never be able to discover which were their own\r\nlands. But, besides this, I would desire, not only that the appellations\r\nof what they call _town-lands_ were changed, but likewise of larger\r\ndistricts, and several towns, and some counties; and particularly the\r\nseats of country-gentlemen, leaving an _alias_ to solve all difficulties\r\nin point of law. But I would by no means trust these alterations to the\r\nowners themselves; who, as they are generally no great clerks, so they\r\nseem to have no large vocabulary about them, nor to be well skilled in\r\nprosody. The utmost extent of their genius lies in naming their country\r\nhabitation by a hill, a mount, a brook, a burrow, a castle, a bawn, a\r\nford, and the like ingenious conceits. Yet these are exceeded by others,\r\nwhereof some have contrived anagramatical appellations, from half their\r\nown and their wives' names joined together: others only from the lady;\r\nas, for instance, a person whose wife's name was Elizabeth, calls his\r\nseat by the name of _Bess-borow_. There is likewise a famous town, where\r\nthe worst iron in the kingdom is made, and it is called _Swandlingbar_:\r\nthe original of which name I shall explain, lest the antiquaries of\r\nfuture ages might be at a loss to derive it. It was a most witty conceit\r\nof four gentlemen, who ruined themselves with this iron project. _Sw._\r\nstands for _Swift_,[193] _And_, for _Sanders_, _Ling_ for _Davling_ and\r\n_Bar._ for _Barry_. Methinks I see the four loggerheads sitting in\r\nconsult, like _Smectymnuus_, each gravely contributing a part of his own\r\nname, to make up one for their place in the ironwork; and could wish\r\nthey had been hanged, as well as undone, for their wit. But I was most\r\npleased with the denomination of a town-land, which I lately saw in an\r\nadvertisement of Pue's paper: \"This is to give notice, that the lands of\r\n_Douras, alias_ WHIG-_borough_,\" &c. Now, this zealous proprietor,\r\nhaving a mind to record his principles in religion or loyalty to future\r\nages, within five miles round him, for want of other merit, thought fit\r\nto make use of this expedient: wherein he seems to mistake his account;\r\nfor this distinguishing term, whig, had a most infamous original,\r\ndenoting a man who favoured the fanatic sect, and an enemy to kings, and\r\nso continued till this idea was a little softened, some years after the\r\nRevolution, and during a part of her late Majesty's reign. After which\r\nit was in disgrace until the Queen's death, since which time it hath\r\nindeed flourished with a witness: But how long will it continue so, in\r\nour variable scene, or what kind of mortal it may describe, is a\r\nquestion which this courtly landlord is not able to answer; and\r\ntherefore he should have set a date on the title of his borough, to let\r\nus know what kind of a creature a whig was in that year of our Lord. I\r\nwould readily assist nomenclators of this costive imagination, and\r\ntherefore I propose to others of the same size in thinking, that, when\r\nthey are at a loss about christening a country-seat, instead of\r\nstraining their invention, they would call it _Booby-borough_,\r\n_Fool-brook_, _Puppy-ford_, _Coxcomb-hall_, _Mount-loggerhead_,\r\n_Dunce-hill_; which are innocent appellations, proper to express the\r\ntalents of the owners. But I cannot reconcile myself to the prudence\r\nof this lord of WHIG-_borough_, because I have not yet heard, among the\r\nPresbyterian squires, how much soever their persons and principles are\r\nin vogue, that any of them have distinguished their country abode by the\r\nname of _Mount-regicide_, _Covenant-hall_, _Fanatic-hill_,\r\n_Roundhead-bawn_, _Canting-brook_, or _Mont-rebel_, and the like; because\r\nthere may probably come a time when those kind of sounds may not be so\r\ngrateful to the ears of the kingdom. For I do not conceive it would be a\r\nmark of discretion, upon supposing a gentleman, in allusion to his name,\r\nor the merit of his ancestors, to call his house _Tyburn-hall_.\r\n\r\nBut the scheme I would propose for changing the denominations of land\r\ninto legible and audible syllables, is by employing some gentlemen in\r\nthe University; who, by the knowledge of the Latin tongue, and their\r\njudgment in sounds, might imitate the Roman way, by translating those\r\nhideous words into their English meanings, and altering the termination\r\nwhere a bare translation will not form a good cadence to the ear, or be\r\neasily delivered from the mouth. And, when both those means happen to\r\nfail, then to name the parcels of land from the nature of the soil, or\r\nsome peculiar circumstance belonging to it; as, in England, _Farn-ham_,\r\n_Oat-lands_, _Black-heath_, _Corn-bury_, _Rye-gate_, _Ash-burnham_,\r\n_Barn-elms_, _Cole-orton_, _Sand-wich_, and many others.\r\n\r\nI am likewise apt to quarrel with some titles of lords among us, that\r\nhave a very ungracious sound, which are apt to communicate mean ideas to\r\nthose who have not the honour to be acquainted with their persons or\r\ntheir virtues, of whom I have the misfortune to be one. But I cannot\r\npardon those gentlemen who have gotten titles since the judicature of\r\nthe peers among us has been taken away, to which they all submitted with\r\na resignation that became good Christians, as undoubtedly they are.\r\nHowever, since that time, I look upon a graceful harmonious title to be\r\nat least forty _per cent._ in the value intrinsic of an Irish peerage;\r\nand, since it is as cheap as the worst, for any Irish law hitherto\r\nenacted in England to the contrary, I would advise the next set, before\r\nthey pass their patents, to call a consultation of scholars and musical\r\ngentlemen, to adjust this most important and essential circumstance. The\r\nScotch noblemen, though born almost under the north pole, have much more\r\ntunable appellations, except some very few, which I suppose were given\r\nthem by the Irish along with their language, at the time when that\r\nkingdom was conquered and planted from hence; and to this day retain the\r\ndenominations of places, and surnames of families, as all historians\r\nagree.[194]\r\n\r\nI should likewise not be sorry, if the names of some bishops' sees were\r\nso much obliged to the alphabet, that upon pronouncing them we might\r\ncontract some veneration for the order and persons of those reverend\r\npeers, which the gross ideas sometimes joined to their titles are very\r\nunjustly apt to diminish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED BY DEAN SWIFT\r\n\r\nTO AN ASSEMBLY OF MERCHANTS MET AT THE GUILDHALL,\r\n\r\nTO DRAW UP A PETITION TO THE LORD LIEUTENANT\r\n\r\nON THE LOWERING OF COIN,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 24TH, 1736.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Writing to Sheridan, under date April 24th, 1736, in a letter\r\n     written partly by herself and partly by Swift, Mrs. Whiteway,\r\n     Swift's housekeeper, refers to the occasion of this speech in the\r\n     following words:\r\n\r\n     \"The Drapier went this day to the Tholsel[195] as a merchant, to\r\n     sign a petition to the government against lowering the gold, where\r\n     we hear he made a long speech, for which he will be reckoned a\r\n     Jacobite. God send hanging does not go round.\" (Scott's edition,\r\n     vol. xviii., p. 470. 1824.)\r\n\r\n     The occasion for this agitation against the lowering of the gold\r\n     arose thus. Archbishop Boulter had, for a long time, been much\r\n     concerned about the want of small silver in Ireland. The subject\r\n     seemed to weigh on him greatly, since he refers to it again and\r\n     again in his correspondence with Carteret, Newcastle, Dorset, and\r\n     Walpole. On May 25th, 1736, he wrote to Walpole to inform him that\r\n     the Lord Lieutenant had taken with him to England \"an application\r\n     from the government for lowering the gold made current here, by\r\n     proclamation, and raising the foreign silver.\" Silver, being\r\n     scarce, bankers and tradesmen were accustomed to charge a premium\r\n     for the changing of gold, as much as sixpence and sevenpence in the\r\n     pound sterling being obtained. (See Boulter's \"Letters,\" vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 122. Dublin, 1770.)\r\n\r\n     There was no question about the benefit of Boulter's scheme in the\r\n     minds of the two Houses of Commons and Lords: Swift, however,\r\n     opposed it vehemently, because he thought the advantage to be\r\n     obtained by this lowering of the gold would accrue to the\r\n     absentees. In 1687 James had issued a proclamation by which an\r\n     English shilling was made the equivalent of thirteen pence in\r\n     Ireland, and an English guinea to twenty-four shillings. Primate\r\n     Boulter's object (gained by the proclamation of the order on\r\n     September 29th, 1737) was to reduce the value of the guinea from\r\n     twenty-three shillings (at which it then stood) to _£1 2s. 9d._\r\n     Swift, thinks Monck Mason, considered the absentees would benefit\r\n     by this \"from the circumstances of the reserved rents, being\r\n     expressed in the imaginary coin, called a pound, but actually paid\r\n     in guineas, when the value of guineas was lowered, it required a\r\n     proportionately greater number to make up a specific sum\" (\"History\r\n     of St. Patrick's,\" p. 401, note c.)\r\n\r\n     Swift, as he wrote to Sheridan, \"battled in vain with the duke and\r\n     his clan.\" He thought it \"just a kind of settlement upon England of\r\n     £25,000 a year for ever; yet some of my friends,\" he goes on to\r\n     say, \"differ from me, though all agree that the absentees will be\r\n     just so much gainers.\" (Letter of date May 22nd, 1737.)\r\n\r\n     In a note to Boulter's letter to the Duke of Newcastle (September\r\n     29th, 1737) the editor of those letters (Ambrose Phillips) remarks:\r\n     \"Such a spirit of opposition had been raised on this occasion by\r\n     Dean Swift and the bankers, that it was thought proper to lodge at\r\n     the Primate's house, an extraordinary guard of soldiers.\" This,\r\n     probably, was after the open exchange of words between Boulter and\r\n     Swift. The Primate had accused Swift of inflaming the minds of the\r\n     people, and hinted broadly that he might incur the displeasure of\r\n     the government. \"I inflame them!\" retorted Swift, \"had I but lifted\r\n     my finger, they would have torn you to pieces.\" The day of the\r\n     proclaiming of the order for the lowering of the gold was marked by\r\n     Swift with the display of a black flag from the steeple of St.\r\n     Patrick's, and the tolling of muffled bells, a piece of conduct\r\n     which Boulter called an insult to the government.\r\n\r\n     It is _à propos_ to record here the revenge Swift took on Boulter\r\n     for the accusation of inflaming the people. The incident was put by\r\n     him into the following verse:\r\n\r\n       \"At Dublin's high feast sat primate and dean,\r\n       Both dressed like divines, with hand and face clean:\r\n       Quoth Hugh of Armagh, 'the mob is grown bold.'\r\n       'Ay, ay,' quoth the Dean, 'the cause is old gold.'\r\n       'No, no,' quoth the primate, 'if causes we sift,\r\n       The mischief arises from witty Dean Swift.'\r\n       The smart one replies, 'There's no wit in the case;\r\n       And nothing of that ever troubled your grace.\r\n       Though with your state sieve your own motions you s--t,\r\n       A Boulter by name is no bolter of wit.\r\n       It's matter of weight, and a mere money job;\r\n       But the lower the coin, the higher the mob.\r\n       Go to tell your friend Bob and the other great folk,\r\n       That sinking the coin is a dangerous joke.\r\n       The Irish dear joys have enough common sense,\r\n       To treat gold reduced like Wood's copper pence.\r\n       It's pity a prelate should die without law;\r\n       But if I say the word--take care of Armagh!\"\r\n\r\n     With the lowering of the gold the Primate imported £2,000 worth of\r\n     copper money for Irish consumption. Swift was most indignant at\r\n     this, and his protest, printed by Faulkner, brought that publisher\r\n     before the Council, and gave Swift a fit of \"nerves.\" (MS. Letter,\r\n     March 31st, 1737, to Lord Orrery, quoted by Craik in Swift's\r\n     \"Life,\" vol. ii., p. 160.) Swift's objection against the copper was\r\n     due to the fact that it was not minted in Ireland. \"I quarrel not\r\n     with the coin, but with the indignity of its not being coined\r\n     here.\" (Same MS. Letter.)\r\n\r\n     Among the pamphlets in the Halliday collection in the Royal Irish\r\n     Academy, Dublin, is a tract with the following title:\r\n\r\n     \"Reasons why we should not lower the Coins now Current in this\r\n     Kingdom ... Dublin: Printed and Sold by E. Waters in Dame-street.\"\r\n\r\n     At the end of this tract is printed Swift's speech to \"an Assembly\r\n     of above one Hundred and fifty eminent persons who met at the Guild\r\n     Hall, on Saturday the 24th April, 1736, in order to draw up their\r\n     Petition, and present it to his grace the Lord Lieutenant against\r\n     lowering said Coin.\" It is from this tract that the present text\r\n     has been taken. The editor is obliged to Sir Henry Craik's \"Life of\r\n     Swift\" for drawing attention to this hitherto uncollected piece.\r\n\r\n     [T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED ON THE LOWERING OF THE COIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI beg you will consider and very well weigh in your hearts, what I am\r\ngoing to say and what I have often said before. There are several bodies\r\nof men, among whom the power of this kingdom is divided--1st, The\r\nLord-Lieutenant, Lords Justices and Council; next to these, my Lords the\r\nBishops; there is likewise my Lord Chancellor, and my Lords the Judges\r\nof the land--with other eminent persons in the land, who have\r\nemployments and great salaries annexed. To these must be added the\r\nCommissioners of the Revenue, with all their under officers: and lastly,\r\ntheir honours of the Army, of all degrees.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, I beg you again to consider that none of these persons\r\nabove named, can ever suffer the loss of one farthing by all the\r\nmiseries under which the kingdom groans at present. For, first, until\r\nthe kingdom be entirely ruined, the Lord-Lieutenant and Lords Justices\r\nmust have their salaries. My Lords the Bishops, whose lands are set at a\r\nfourth part value, will be sure of their rents and their fines. My Lords\r\nthe Judges and those of other employments in the country must likewise\r\nhave their salaries. The gentlemen of the revenue will pay themselves,\r\nand as to the officers of the army, the consequence of not paying them\r\nis obvious enough. Nay, so far will those persons I have already\r\nmentioned be from suffering, that, on the contrary, their revenues being\r\nno way lessened by the fall of money, and the price of all commodities\r\nconsiderably sunk thereby, they must be great gainers. Therefore,\r\nGentlemen, I do entreat you that as long as you live, you will look on\r\nall persons who are for lowering the gold, or any other coin, as no\r\nfriends to this poor kingdom, but such, who find their private account\r\nin what will be detrimental to Ireland. And as the absentees are, in\r\nthe strongest view, our greatest enemies, first by consuming above\r\none-half of the rents of this nation abroad, and secondly by turning the\r\nweight, by their absence, so much on the Popish side, by weakening the\r\nProtestant interest, can there be a greater folly than to pave a bridge\r\nof gold at your own expense, to support them in their luxury and vanity\r\nabroad, while hundreds of thousands are starving at home for want of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS PIECES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH ELOQUENCE.[196]\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you will come and take a drink of my ale. I always brew with my\r\nown bear. I was at your large Toun's house, in the county of Fermanegh.\r\nHe has planted a great many oak trees, and elm trees round his lough:\r\nAnd a good warrent he had, it is kind father for him, I stayd with him a\r\nweek. At breakfast we had sometimes sowins, and sometimes stirrabout,\r\nand sometimes fraughauns and milk; but his cows would hardly give a drop\r\nof milk. For his head had lost the pachaun. His neighbour Squire Dolt is\r\na meer buddaugh. I'd give a cow in Conaught you could see him. He keeps\r\nnone but garrauns, and he rides on a soogaun with nothing for his bridle\r\nbut gadd. In that, he is a meer spaulpeen, and a perfect Monaghan, and a\r\nMunster Croch to the bargain. Without you saw him on Sunday you would\r\ntake him for a Brogadeer and a spaned to a carl did not know had to draw\r\nbutter. We drank balcan and whisky out of madders. And the devil a\r\nniglugam had but a caddao. I wonder your cozen does na learn him better\r\nmanners. Your cousin desires you will buy him some cheney cups. I\r\nremember he had a great many; I wonder what is gone with them. I\r\ncoshered on him for a week. He has a fine staggard of corn. His dedy has\r\nbeen very unwell. I was sorry that anything ayl her father's child.\r\n\r\nFiring is very dear thereabout. The turf is drawn tuo near in Kislers;\r\nand they send new rounds from the mines, nothing comes in the Cleeves\r\nbut stock. We had a sereroar of beef, and once a runy for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIALOGUE IN HIBERNIAN STYLE BETWEEN A. AND B.[197]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Them aples is very good.\r\n\r\nB.

[I] hear he was a great pet of yours.\r\n\r\nA. Where does he live?\r\n\r\nB. Opposite the red Lyon.\r\n\r\nA. I think he behaved very ill the last sessions.\r\n\r\nB. That's true, but I cannot forbear loving his father's child: Will you\r\ntake a glass of my ale?\r\n\r\nA. No, I thank you, I took a drink of small beer at home before I came\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nB. I always brew with my own bear: You have a country-house: Are you [a]\r\nplanter.\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I have planted a great many oak trees and ash trees, and some\r\nelm trees round a lough.\r\n\r\nB. And so a good warrant you have: It is kind father for you.\r\n\r\nA. And what breakfast do you take in the country?\r\n\r\nB. Sometimes stirabout, and in sumer we have the best frauhaurg in all\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nA. What kind of man is your neighbour Squire Dolt?\r\n\r\nB. Why, a meer Buddogh. He sometimes coshers with me; and once a month I\r\ntake a pipe with him, and we shot it about for an hour together.\r\n\r\nA. I hear he keeps good horses.\r\n\r\nB. None but garrauns, and I have seen him often riding on a sougawn. In\r\nshort, he is no better than a spawlpien; a perfect Marcghen. When I was\r\nthere last, we had nothing but a medder to drink out of; and the devil a\r\nnighigam but a caddao. Will you go see him when you come unto our\r\nquarter?\r\n\r\nA. Not _without_ you go with me.\r\n\r\nB. Will you lend me your snuff-box?\r\n\r\nA. Do you make good cheese and butter?\r\n\r\nB.

AND WORTHY SIRS,\r\n\r\nAs I had the honour of receiving some part of my education in your\r\nuniversity, and the good fortune to be of some service to it while I had\r\na share of credit at court, as well as since, when I had very little or\r\nnone, I may hope to be excused for laying a case before you, and\r\noffering my opinion upon it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunkin,[198] whom you all know, sent me some time ago a memorial\r\nintended to be laid before you, which perhaps he hath already done. His\r\nrequest is, that you would be pleased to enlarge his annuity at present,\r\nand that he may have the same right, in his turn, to the first church\r\npreferment, vacant in your gift, as if he had been made a fellow,\r\naccording to the scheme of his aunt's will; because the absurdity of the\r\ncondition in it ought to be imputed to the old woman's ignorance,\r\nalthough her intention be very manifest; and the intention of the\r\ntestator in all wills is chiefly regarded by the law. What I would\r\ntherefore propose is this, that you would increase his pension to one\r\nhundred pounds a-year, and make him a firm promise of the first church\r\nliving in your disposal, to the value of two hundred pounds a-year, or\r\nsomewhat more. This I take to be a reasonable medium between what he\r\nhath proposed in his memorial, and what you allow him at present.\r\n\r\nI am almost a perfect stranger to Mr. Dunkin, having never seen him\r\nabove twice, and then in mixed company, nor should I know his person if\r\nI met him in the streets.\r\n\r\nBut I know he is a man of wit and parts; which if applied properly to\r\nthe business of his function, instead of poetry, (wherein it must be\r\nowned he sometimes excels,) might be of great use and service to him.\r\n\r\nI hope you will please to remember, that, since your body hath received\r\nno inconsiderable benefaction from the aunt, it will much increase your\r\nreputation, rather to err on the generous side toward the nephew.\r\n\r\nThese are my thoughts, after frequently reflecting on the case under all\r\nits circumstances; and so I leave it to your wiser judgments.\r\n\r\nI am, with true respect and esteem, reverend and worthy Sirs,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                JON. SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN, SHERIFFS, AND\r\nCOMMON-COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Deanery House, Dublin,\r\n                                         August 15, 1737.\r\n\r\n GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI received from you, some weeks ago, the honour of my freedom, in a\r\nsilver box, by the hands of Mr. Stannard; but it was not delivered to me\r\nin as many weeks more; because, I suppose, he was too full of more\r\nimportant business. Since that time, I have been wholly confined by\r\nsickness, so that I was not able to return you my acknowledgment; and it\r\nis with much difficulty I do it now, my head continuing in great\r\ndisorder. Mr. Faulkner will be the bearer of my letter, who sets out\r\nthis morning for Cork.\r\n\r\nI could have wished, as I am a private man, that, in the instrument of\r\nmy freedom, you had pleased to assign your reasons for making choice of\r\nme. I know it is a usual compliment to bestow the freedom of the city on\r\nan archbishop, or lord-chancellor, and other persons of great titles,\r\nmerely on account of their stations or power: but a private man, and a\r\nperfect stranger, without power or grandeur, may justly expect to find\r\nthe motives assigned in the instrument of his freedom, on what account\r\nhe is thus distinguished. And yet I cannot discover, in the whole\r\nparchment scrip, any one reason offered. Next, as to the silver box,\r\nthere is not so much as my name upon it, nor any one syllable to show it\r\nwas a present from your city. Therefore I have, by the advice of\r\nfriends, agreeable with my opinion, sent back the box and instrument of\r\nfreedom by Mr. Faulkner, to be returned to you; leaving to your choice\r\nwhether to insert the reasons for which you were pleased to give me my\r\nfreedom, or bestow the box upon some more worthy person whom you may\r\nhave an intention to honour, because it will equally fit everybody.\r\n\r\n     I am, with true esteem and gratitude,\r\n                  Gentlemen,\r\n       Your most obedient and obliged servant,\r\n                                          JON. SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONOURABLE THE SOCIETY OF THE\r\nGOVERNOR AND ASSISTANTS, LONDON,\r\n\r\nFOR THE NEW PLANTATION IN ULSTER, WITHIN THE REALM OF IRELAND,\r\nAT THE CHAMBER IN GUILDHALL, LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    April 19, 1739.\r\n WORTHY GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI heartily recommend to your very Worshipful Society, the Reverend Mr.\r\nWilliam Dunkin,[199] for the living of Colrane, vacant by the death of\r\nDr. Squire. Mr. Dunkin is a gentleman of great learning and wit, true\r\nreligion, and excellent morals. It is only for these qualifications that\r\nI recommend him to your patronage; and I am confident that you will\r\nnever repent the choice of such a man, who will be ready at any time to\r\nobey your commands. You have my best wishes, and all my endeavours for\r\nyour prosperity: and I shall, during my life, continue to be, with the\r\ntruest respect and highest esteem,\r\n\r\n                 Worthy Sirs,\r\n         Your most obedient, and most humble servant,\r\n                                                JON.

The visit\r\n     paid by him to Walpole, already referred to, resulted in nothing,\r\n     though it cannot, on that account, be argued that Swift's open\r\n     friendship for, and even support of, Pulteney and Bolingbroke was\r\n     owing to his failure with Walpole. Swift pleaded with Walpole for\r\n     Ireland and Ireland only, as his letter to Peterborough amply\r\n     testifies. It had nothing to do with the political situation in\r\n     England. The explanation for this sympathy is most likely found in\r\n     Sir Henry Craik's suggestion that Swift humoured the pretences of\r\n     his friends that they were of the party that maintained the\r\n     national virtues, resisted corruption, and defended liberty against\r\n     arbitrary power. To Pulteney Swift always wrote reminding him that\r\n     the country looked to him as its saviour, and he wrote in a similar\r\n     vein to Bolingbroke and Pope. The \"Craftsman\" had been founded by\r\n     Pulteney and Bolingbroke (a curious companionship when one\r\n     remembers the past lives of these two men) for the express purpose\r\n     of bringing low Walpole's political power. It began by exposing the\r\n     tricks of \"Robin\" and continued to lay bare the cunning and wiles\r\n     of the \"Craftsman\" at the head of the government of the country.\r\n     Both Pulteney and Bolingbroke wrote regularly, and the former\r\n     displayed a journalistic power quite extraordinary.\r\n\r\n     The letter which follows was written by Swift when in London on the\r\n     occasion of his last visit; but a note in Craik's \"Life of Swift\"\r\n     (vol. ii., pp. 166-167) is very interesting as showing that Swift\r\n     did certainly give hints for some of the subjects for discussion. I\r\n     take the liberty to transcribe this note in full. Sir Henry Craik\r\n     thinks it more than likely that Swift may have suggested, during\r\n     his last visit to London, some of the lines on which Bolingbroke\r\n     and Pulteney worked. In the note he adds:\r\n\r\n     \"This finds some confirmation, from the following heads of a Tract,\r\n     which I have found in a memorandum in Swift's handwriting. The\r\n     memorandum belongs to Mr. Frederick Locker [now dead], who kindly\r\n     permitted me to use his papers, the same which came from Theophilus\r\n     Swift into Scott's possession. But the interest of this memorandum\r\n     escaped Scott's notice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"PROPOSAL FOR VIRTUE.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Every little fellow who has a vote now corrupted.\r\n\r\n     \"An arithmetical computation, how much spent in election of\r\n     Commons, and pensions and foreign courts: how then can our debts be\r\n     paid?\r\n\r\n     \"No fear that gentlemen will not stand and serve without Pensions,\r\n     and that they will let the Kingdom be invaded for want of fleets\r\n     and armies, or bring in Pretender, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"How K(ing) will ensure his own interest as well as the Publick: he\r\n     is now forced to keep himself bare, etc., at least, late King was.\r\n\r\n     \"Perpetual expedients, stop-gaps, etc., at long run must terminate\r\n     in something fatal, as it does in private estates.\r\n\r\n     \"There may be probably 10,000 landed men in England fit for\r\n     Parliament.

S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A LETTER TO THE WRITER OF\r\n  THE OCCASIONAL PAPER.[200]\r\n\r\n  [VIDE THE CRAFTSMAN, 1727.]\r\n\r\n\r\n SIR,\r\n\r\nAlthough, in one of your papers, you declare an intention of turning\r\nthem, during the dead season of the year, into accounts of domestic and\r\nforeign intelligence; yet I think we, your correspondents, should not\r\nunderstand your meaning so literally, as if you intended to reject\r\ninserting any other paper, which might probably be useful for the\r\npublic. Neither, indeed, am I fully convinced that this new course you\r\nresolve to take will render you more secure than your former laudable\r\npractice, of inserting such speculations as were sent you by several\r\nwell-wishers to the good of the kingdom; however grating such notices\r\nmight be to some, who wanted neither power nor inclination to resent\r\nthem at your cost. For, since there is a direct law against spreading\r\nfalse news, if you should venture to tell us in one of the Craftsmen\r\nthat the Dey of Algiers had got the toothache, or the King of Bantam had\r\ntaken a purge, and the facts should be contradicted in succeeding\r\npackets; I do not see what plea you could offer to avoid the utmost\r\npenalty of the law, because you are not supposed to be very gracious\r\namong those who are most able to hurt you.\r\n\r\nBesides, as I take your intentions to be sincerely meant for the public\r\nservice, so your original method of entertaining and instructing us will\r\nbe more general and more useful in this season of the year, when people\r\nare retired to amusements more cool, more innocent, and much more\r\nreasonable than those they have left; when their passions are subsided\r\nor suspended; when they have no occasions of inflaming themselves, or\r\neach other; where they will have opportunities of hearing common sense,\r\nevery day in the week, from their tenants or neighbouring farmers, and\r\nthereby be qualified, in hours of rain or leisure, to read and consider\r\nthe advice or information you shall send them.\r\n\r\nAnother weighty reason why you should not alter your manner of writing,\r\nby dwindling to a newsmonger, is because there is no suspension of arms\r\nagreed on between you and your adversaries, who fight with a sort of\r\nweapons which have two wonderful qualities, that they are never to be\r\nworn out, and are best wielded by the weakest hands, and which the\r\npoverty of our language forceth me to call by the trite appellations of\r\nscurrility, slander, and Billingsgate. I am far from thinking that these\r\ngentlemen, or rather their employers, (for the operators themselves are\r\ntoo obscure to be guessed at) should be answered after their own way,\r\nalthough it were possible to drag them out of their obscurity; but I\r\nwish you would enquire what real use such a conduct is to the cause they\r\nhave been so largely paid to defend. The author of the three first\r\nOccasional Letters, a person altogether unknown, hath been thought to\r\nglance (for what reasons he best knows) at some public proceedings, as\r\nif they were not agreeable to his private opinions. In answer to this,\r\nthe pamphleteers retained on the other side are instructed by their\r\nsuperiors, to single out an adversary whose abilities they have most\r\nreason to apprehend, and to load himself, his family, and friends, with\r\nall the infamy that a perpetual conversation in Bridewell, Newgate, and\r\nthe stews could furnish them; but, at the same time, so very unluckily,\r\nthat the most distinguishing parts of their characters strike directly\r\nin the face of their benefactor, whose idea presenting itself along with\r\nhis guineas perpetually to their imagination, occasioned this desperate\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\nBut, allowing this heap of slander to be truth, and applied to the\r\nproper person; what is to be the consequence? Are our public debts to be\r\nthe sooner paid; the corruptions that author complains of to be the\r\nsooner cured; an honourable peace, or a glorious war the more likely to\r\nensue; trade to flourish; the Ostend Company to be demolished;\r\nGibraltar and Port Mahon left entire in our possession; the balance of\r\nEurope to be preserved; the malignity of parties to be for ever at an\r\nend; none but persons of merit, virtue, genius, and learning to be\r\nencouraged? I ask whether any of these effects will follow upon the\r\npublication of this author's libel, even supposing he could prove every\r\nsyllable of it to be true?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I am well assured, that the only reason of ascribing\r\nthose papers to a particular person, is built upon the information of a\r\ncertain pragmatical spy of quality, well known to act in that capacity\r\nby those into whose company he insinuates himself; a sort of persons\r\nwho, although without much love, esteem, or dread of people in present\r\npower, yet have too much common prudence to speak their thoughts with\r\nfreedom before such an intruder; who, therefore, imposes grossly upon\r\nhis masters, if he makes them pay for anything but his own conjectures.\r\n\r\nIt is a grievous mistake in a great minister to neglect or despise, much\r\nmore to irritate men of genius and learning. I have heard one of the\r\nwisest persons in my time observe, that an administration was to be\r\nknown and judged by the talents of those who appeared their advocates in\r\nprint. This I must never allow to be a general rule; yet I cannot but\r\nthink it prodigiously unfortunate, that, among the answerers, defenders,\r\nrepliers, and panegyrists, started up in defence of present persons and\r\nproceedings, there hath not yet arisen one whose labours we can read\r\nwith patience, however we may applaud their loyalty and good will. And\r\nall this with the advantages of constant ready pay, of natural and\r\nacquired venom, and a grant of the whole fund of slander, to range over\r\nand riot in as they please.[201]\r\n\r\nOn the other side, a turbulent writer of Occasional Letters, and other\r\nvexatious papers, in conjunction perhaps with one or two friends as bad\r\nas himself, is able to disconcert, tease, and sour us whenever he\r\nthinks fit, merely by the strength of genius and truth; and after so\r\ndexterous a manner, that, when we are vexed to the soul, and well know\r\nthe reasons why we are so, we are ashamed to own the first, and cannot\r\ntell how to express the other. In a word, it seems to me that all the\r\nwriters are on one side, and all the railers on the other.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not pretend to assert, that it is impossible for an ill\r\nminister to find men of wit who may be drawn, by a very valuable\r\nconsideration, to undertake his defence; but the misfortune is, that the\r\nheads of such writers rebel against their hearts; their genius forsakes\r\nthem, when they would offer to prostitute it to the service of\r\ninjustice, corruption, party rage, and false representations of things\r\nand persons.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the best argument I can offer in defence of great men, who\r\nhave been of late so very unhappy in the choice of their\r\npaper-champions; although I cannot much commend their good husbandry, in\r\nthose exorbitant payments of twenty and sixty guineas at a time for a\r\nscurvy pamphlet; since the sort of work they require is what will all\r\ncome within the talents of any one who hath enjoyed the happiness of a\r\nvery bad education, hath kept the vilest company, is endowed with a\r\nservile spirit, is master of an empty purse, and a heart full of malice.\r\n\r\nBut, to speak the truth in soberness; it should seem a little hard,\r\nsince the old Whiggish principle hath been recalled of standing up for\r\nthe liberty of the press, to a degree that no man, for several years\r\npast, durst venture out a thought which did not square to a point with\r\nthe maxims and practices that then prevailed: I say, it is a little hard\r\nthat the vilest mercenaries should be countenanced, preferred, rewarded,\r\nfor discharging their brutalities against men of honour, only upon a\r\nbare conjecture.\r\n\r\nIf it should happen that these profligates have attacked an innocent\r\nperson, I ask what satisfaction can their hirers give in return? Not all\r\nthe wealth raked together by the most corrupt rapacious ministers, in\r\nthe longest course of unlimited power, would be sufficient to atone for\r\nthe hundredth part of such an injury.\r\n\r\nIn the common way of thinking, it is a situation sufficient in all\r\nconscience to satisfy a reasonable ambition, for a private person to\r\ncommand the forces, the laws, the revenues of a great kingdom, to\r\nreward and advance his followers and flatterers as he pleases, and to\r\nkeep his enemies (real or imaginary) in the dust. In such an exaltation,\r\nwhy should he be at the trouble to make use of fools to sound his\r\npraises, (because I always thought the lion was hard set, when he chose\r\nthe ass for his trumpeter) or knaves to revenge his quarrels, at the\r\nexpense of innocent men's reputations?\r\n\r\nWith all those advantages, I cannot see why persons, in the height of\r\npower, should be under the least concern on account of their reputation,\r\nfor which they have no manner of use; or to ruin that of others, which\r\nmay perhaps be the only possession their enemies have left them.\r\nSupposing times of corruption, which I am very far from doing, if a\r\nwriter displays them in their proper colours, does he do anything worse\r\nthan sending customers to the shop? \"Here only, at the sign of the\r\nBrazen Head, are to be sold places and pensions: beware of counterfeits,\r\nand take care of mistaking the door.\"\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I think it very unnecessary to give the character of a\r\ngreat minister in the fulness of his power, because it is a thing that\r\nnaturally does itself, and is obvious to the eyes of all mankind; for\r\nhis personal qualities are all derived into the most minute parts of his\r\nadministration. If this be just, prudent, regular, impartial, intent\r\nupon the public good, prepared for present exigencies, and provident of\r\nthe future; such is the director himself in his private capacity: If it\r\nbe rapacious, insolent, partial, palliating long and deep diseases of\r\nthe public with empirical remedies, false, disguised, impudent,\r\nmalicious, revengeful; you shall infallibly find the private life of the\r\nconductor to answer in every point; nay, what is more, every twinge of\r\nthe gout or gravel will be felt in their consequences by the community.\r\nAs the thief-catcher, upon viewing a house broke open, could immediately\r\ndistinguish, from the manner of the workmanship, by what hand it was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to form a maxim against which an exception is not ready to\r\nstart up: So, in the present case, where the minister grows enormously\r\nrich, the public is proportionably poor; as, in a private family, the\r\nsteward always thrives the fastest when his lord is running out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE COURT AND EMPIRE OF JAPAN.[202]\r\n\r\n\r\nRegoge[203] was the thirty-fourth emperor of Japan, and began his reign\r\nin the year 341 of the Christian era, succeeding to Nena,[204] a\r\nprincess who governed with great felicity.\r\n\r\nThere had been a revolution in that empire about twenty-six years\r\nbefore, which made some breaches in the hereditary line; and Regoge,\r\nsuccessor to Nena, although of the royal family, was a distant\r\nrelation. There were two violent parties in the empire, which began in\r\nthe time of the revolution above mentioned; and, at the death of the\r\nEmpress Nena, were in the highest degree of animosity, each charging the\r\nother with a design of introducing new gods, and changing the civil\r\nconstitution. The names of these two parties were Husiges and\r\nYortes.[205] The latter were those whom Nena, the late empress, most\r\nfavoured towards the end of her reign, and by whose advice she governed.\r\n\r\nThe Husige faction, enraged at their loss of power, made private\r\napplications to Regoge during the life of the empress; which prevailed\r\nso far, that, upon her death, the new emperor wholly disgraced the\r\nYortes, and employed only the Husiges in all his affairs. The Japanese\r\nauthor highly blames his Imperial Majesty's proceeding in this affair;\r\nbecause, it was allowed on all hands, that he had then a happy\r\nopportunity of reconciling parties for ever by a moderating scheme. But\r\nhe, on the contrary, began his reign by openly disgracing the principal\r\nand most popular Yortes, some of which had been chiefly instrumental in\r\nraising him to the throne. By this mistaken step he occasioned a\r\nrebellion; which, although it were soon quelled by some very surprising\r\nturns of fortune, yet the fear, whether real or pretended, of new\r\nattempts, engaged him in such immense charges, that, instead of clearing\r\nany part of that prodigious debt left on his kingdom by the former war,\r\nwhich might have been done by any tolerable management, in twelve years\r\nof the most profound peace; he left his empire loaden with a vast\r\naddition to the old encumbrance.\r\n\r\nThis prince, before he succeeded to the empire of Japan, was king of\r\nTedsu,[206] a dominion seated on the continent, to the west side of\r\nJapan. Tedsu was the place of his birth, and more beloved by him than\r\nhis new empire; for there he spent some months almost every year, and\r\nthither was supposed to have conveyed great sums of money, saved out of\r\nhis Imperial revenues.\r\n\r\nThere were two maritime towns of great importance bordering upon\r\nTedsu:[207] Of these he purchased a litigated title; and, to support it,\r\nwas forced not only to entrench deeply on his Japanese revenues, but to\r\nengage in alliances very dangerous to the Japanese empire.[208]\r\n\r\nJapan was at that time a limited monarchy, which some authors are of\r\nopinion was introduced there by a detachment from the numerous army of\r\nBrennus, who ravaged a great part of Asia; and, those of them who fixed\r\nin Japan, left behind them that kind of military institution, which the\r\nnorthern people, in ensuing ages, carried through most parts of Europe;\r\nthe generals becoming kings, the great officers a senate of nobles, with\r\na representative from every centenary of private soldiers; and, in the\r\nassent of the majority in these two bodies, confirmed by the general,\r\nthe legislature consisted.\r\n\r\nI need not farther explain a matter so universally known; but return to\r\nmy subject.\r\n\r\nThe Husige faction, by a gross piece of negligence in the Yortes, had so\r\nfar insinuated themselves and their opinions into the favour of Regoge\r\nbefore he came to the empire, that this prince firmly believed them to\r\nbe his only true friends, and the others his mortal enemies.[209] By\r\nthis opinion he governed all the actions of his reign.\r\n\r\nThe emperor died suddenly, in his journey to Tedsu; where, according to\r\nhis usual custom, he was going to pass the summer.\r\n\r\nThis prince, during his whole reign, continued an absolute stranger to\r\nthe language, the manners, the laws, and the religion of Japan; and\r\npassing his whole time among old mistresses, or a few privadoes, left\r\nthe whole management of the empire in the hands of a minister, upon the\r\ncondition of being made easy in his personal revenues, and the\r\nmanagement of parties in the senate. His last minister,[210] who\r\ngoverned in the most arbitrary manner for several years, he was thought\r\nto hate more than he did any other person in Japan, except his only\r\nson, the heir to the empire. The dislike he bore to the former was,\r\nbecause the minister, under pretence that he could not govern the senate\r\nwithout disposing of employments among them, would not suffer his master\r\nto oblige one single person, but disposed of all to his own relations\r\nand dependants. But, as to that continued and virulent hatred he bore to\r\nthe prince his son, from the beginning of his reign to his death, the\r\nhistorian hath not accounted for it, further than by various\r\nconjectures, which do not deserve to be related.\r\n\r\nThe minister above mentioned was of a family not contemptible, had been\r\nearly a senator, and from his youth a mortal enemy to the Yortes. He had\r\nbeen formerly disgraced in the senate, for some frauds in the management\r\nof a public trust.[211] He was perfectly skilled, by long practice, in\r\nthe senatorial forms; and dexterous in the purchasing of votes, from\r\nthose who could find their accounts better in complying with his\r\nmeasures, than they could probably lose by any tax that might be charged\r\non the kingdom. He seemed to fail, in point of policy, by not concealing\r\nhis gettings, never scrupling openly to lay out vast sums of money in\r\npaintings, buildings, and purchasing estates; when it was known, that,\r\nupon his first coming into business, upon the death of the Empress Nena,\r\nhis fortune was but inconsiderable. He had the most boldness, and the\r\nleast magnanimity that ever any mortal was endowed with. By enriching\r\nhis relations, friends, and dependants, in a most exorbitant manner, he\r\nwas weak enough to imagine that he had provided a support against an\r\nevil day. He had the best among all false appearances of courage, which\r\nwas a most unlimited assurance, whereby he would swagger the boldest men\r\ninto a dread of his power, but had not the smallest portion of\r\nmagnanimity, growing jealous, and disgracing every man, who was known to\r\nbear the least civility to those he disliked. He had some small\r\nsmattering in books, but no manner of politeness; nor, in his whole\r\nlife, was ever known to advance any one person, upon the score of wit,\r\nlearning, or abilities for business. The whole system of his ministry\r\nwas corruption; and he never gave bribe or pension, without frankly\r\ntelling the receivers what he expected from them, and threatening them\r\nto put an end to his bounty, if they failed to comply in every\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nA few months before the emperor's death, there was a design concerted\r\nbetween some eminent persons of both parties, whom the desperate state\r\nof the empire had united, to accuse the minister at the first meeting of\r\na new chosen senate, which was then to assemble according to the laws of\r\nthat empire. And it was believed, that the vast expense he must be at in\r\nchoosing an assembly proper for his purpose, added to the low state of\r\nthe treasury, the increasing number of pensioners, the great discontent\r\nof the people, and the personal hatred of the emperor; would, if well\r\nlaid open in the senate, be of weight enough to sink the minister, when\r\nit should appear to his very pensioners and creatures that he could not\r\nsupply them much longer.\r\n\r\nWhile this scheme was in agitation, an account came of the emperor's\r\ndeath, and the prince his son,[212] with universal joy, mounted the\r\nthrone of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe new emperor had always lived a private life, during the reign of his\r\nfather; who, in his annual absence, never trusted him more than once\r\nwith the reins of government, which he held so evenly that he became too\r\npopular to be confided in any more. He was thought not unfavourable to\r\nthe Yortes, at least not altogether to approve the virulence wherewith\r\nhis father proceeded against them; and therefore, immediately upon his\r\nsuccession, the principal persons of that denomination came, in several\r\nbodies, to kiss the hem of his garment, whom he received with great\r\ncourtesy, and some of them with particular marks of distinction.\r\n\r\nThe prince, during the reign of his father, having not been trusted with\r\nany public charge, employed his leisure in learning the language, the\r\nreligion, the customs, and disposition of the Japanese; wherein he\r\nreceived great information, among others, from Nomptoc[213], master of\r\nhis finances, and president of the senate, who secretly hated Lelop-Aw,\r\nthe minister; and likewise from Ramneh[214], a most eminent senator;\r\nwho, despairing to do any good with the father, had, with great\r\nindustry, skill, and decency, used his endeavour to instil good\r\nprinciples into the young prince.\r\n\r\nUpon the news of the former emperor's death, a grand council was\r\nsummoned of course, where little passed besides directing the ceremony\r\nof proclaiming the successor. But, in some days after, the new emperor\r\nhaving consulted with those persons in whom he could chiefly confide,\r\nand maturely considered in his own mind the present state of his\r\naffairs, as well as the disposition of his people, convoked another\r\nassembly of his council; wherein, after some time spent in general\r\nbusiness, suitable to the present emergency, he directed Lelop-Aw to\r\ngive him, in as short terms as he conveniently could, an account of the\r\nnation's debts, of his management in the senate, and his negotiations\r\nwith foreign courts: Which that minister having delivered, according to\r\nhis usual manner, with much assurance and little satisfaction, the\r\nemperor desired to be fully satisfied in the following particulars.\r\n\r\nWhether the vast expense of choosing such members into the senate, as\r\nwould be content to do the public business, were absolutely necessary?\r\n\r\nWhether those members, thus chosen in, would cross and impede the\r\nnecessary course of affairs, unless they were supplied with great sums\r\nof money, and continued pensions?\r\n\r\nWhether the same corruption and perverseness were to be expected from\r\nthe nobles?\r\n\r\nWhether the empire of Japan were in so low a condition, that the\r\nimperial envoys, at foreign courts, must be forced to purchase\r\nalliances, or prevent a war, by immense bribes, given to the ministers\r\nof all the neighbouring princes?\r\n\r\nWhy the debts of the empire were so prodigiously advanced, in a peace of\r\ntwelve years at home and abroad?\r\n\r\nWhether the Yortes were universally enemies to the religion and laws of\r\nthe empire, and to the imperial family now reigning?\r\n\r\nWhether those persons, whose revenues consist in lands, do not give\r\nsurer pledges of fidelity to the public, and are more interested in the\r\nwelfare of the empire, than others whose fortunes consist only in money?\r\n\r\nAnd because Lelop-Aw, for several years past, had engrossed the whole\r\nadministration, the emperor signified, that from him alone he expected\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nThis minister, who had sagacity enough to cultivate an interest in the\r\nyoung prince's family, during the late emperor's life, received early\r\nintelligence from one of his emissaries of what was intended at the\r\ncouncil, and had sufficient time to frame as plausible an answer as his\r\ncause and conduct would allow. However, having desired a few minutes to\r\nput his thoughts in order, he delivered them in the following manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Upon this short unexpected warning, to answer your Imperial Majesty's\r\nqueries I should be wholly at a loss, in your Majesty's august presence,\r\nand that of this most noble assembly, if I were armed with a weaker\r\ndefence than my own loyalty and integrity, and the prosperous success of\r\nmy endeavours.\r\n\r\n\"It is well known that the death of the Empress Nena happened in a most\r\nmiraculous juncture; and that, if she had lived two months longer, your\r\nillustrious family would have been deprived of your right, and we should\r\nhave seen an usurper upon your throne, who would have wholly changed the\r\nconstitution of this empire, both civil and sacred; and although that\r\nempress died in a most opportune season, yet the peaceable entrance of\r\nyour Majesty's father was effected by a continual series of miracles.\r\nThe truth of this appears by that unnatural rebellion which the Yortes\r\nraised, without the least provocation, in the first year of the late\r\nemperor's reign, which may be sufficient to convince your Majesty, that\r\nevery soul of that denomination was, is, and will be for ever, a\r\nfavourer of the Pretender, a mortal enemy to your illustrious family,\r\nand an introducer of new gods into the empire. Upon this foundation was\r\nbuilt the whole conduct of our affairs; and, since a great majority of\r\nthe kingdom was at that time reckoned to favour the Yortes faction, who,\r\nin the regular course of elections, must certainly be chosen members of\r\nthe senate then to be convoked; it was necessary, by the force of money,\r\nto influence elections in such a manner, that your Majesty's father\r\nmight have a sufficient number to weigh down the scale on his side, and\r\nthereby carry on those measures which could only secure him and his\r\nfamily in the possession of the empire. To support this original plan I\r\ncame into the service: But the members of the senate, knowing themselves\r\nevery day more necessary, upon the choosing of a new senate, I found the\r\ncharges to increase; and that, after they were chosen, they insisted\r\nupon an increase of their pensions; because they well knew that the work\r\ncould not be carried on without them: And I was more general in my\r\ndonatives, because I thought it was more for the honour of the crown,\r\nthat every vote should pass without a division; and that, when a debate\r\nwas proposed, it should immediately be quashed, by putting the question.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, The date of the present senate is expired, and your Imperial\r\nMajesty is now to convoke a new one; which, I confess, will be somewhat\r\nmore expensive than the last, because the Yortes, from your favourable\r\nreception, have begun to reassume a spirit whereof the country had some\r\nintelligence; and we know the majority of the people, without proper\r\nmanagement, would be still in that fatal interest. However, I dare\r\nundertake, with the charge only of four hundred thousand sprangs,[215]\r\nto return as great a majority of senators of the true stamp, as your\r\nMajesty can desire. As to the sums of money paid in foreign courts, I\r\nhope, in some years, to ease the nation of them, when we and our\r\nneighbours come to a good understanding. However, I will be bold to say,\r\nthey are cheaper than a war, where your Majesty is to be a principal.\r\n\r\n\"The pensions, indeed, to senators and other persons, must needs\r\nincrease, from the restiveness of some, and scrupulous nature of others;\r\nand the new members, who are unpractised, must have better\r\nencouragement. However, I dare undertake to bring the eventual charge\r\nwithin eight hundred thousand sprangs. But, to make this easy, there\r\nshall be new funds raised, of which I have several schemes ready,\r\nwithout taxing bread or flesh, which shall be referred to more pressing\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty knows it is the laudable custom of all Eastern princes, to\r\nleave the whole management of affairs, both civil and military, to their\r\nviziers. The appointments for your family, and private purse, shall\r\nexceed those of your predecessors: You shall be at no trouble, further\r\nthan to appear sometimes in council, and leave the rest to me: You shall\r\nhear no clamour or complaints: Your senate shall, upon occasions,\r\ndeclare you the best of princes, the father of your country, the arbiter\r\nof Asia, the defender of the oppressed, and the delight of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, Hear not those who would most falsely, impiously, and maliciously\r\ninsinuate, that your government can be carried on without that\r\nwholesome, necessary expedient, of sharing the public revenue with your\r\nfaithful deserving senators. This, I know, my enemies are pleased to\r\ncall bribery and corruption. Be it so: But I insist, that without this\r\nbribery and corruption, the wheels of government will not turn, or at\r\nleast will be apt to take fire, like other wheels, unless they be\r\ngreased at proper times. If an angel from heaven should descend, to\r\ngovern this empire upon any other scheme than what our enemies call\r\ncorruption, he must return from whence he came, and leave the work\r\nundone.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, It is well known we are a trading nation, and consequently cannot\r\nthrive in a bargain where nothing is to be gained. The poor electors,\r\nwho run from their shops, or the plough, for the service of their\r\ncountry, are they not to be considered for their labour and their\r\nloyalty? The candidates, who, with the hazard of their persons, the loss\r\nof their characters, and the ruin of their fortunes, are preferred to\r\nthe senate, in a country where they are strangers, before the very lords\r\nof the soil; are they not to be rewarded for their zeal to your\r\nMajesty's service, and qualified to live in your metropolis as becomes\r\nthe lustre of their stations?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, If I have given great numbers of the most profitable employments\r\namong my own relations and nearest allies, it was not out of any\r\npartiality, but because I know them best, and can best depend upon them.\r\nI have been at the pains to mould and cultivate their opinions. Abler\r\nheads might probably have been found, but they would not be equally\r\nunder my direction. A huntsman, who hath the absolute command of his\r\ndogs, will hunt more effectually than with a better pack, to whose\r\nmanner and cry he is a stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, Upon the whole, I will appeal to all those who best knew your\r\nroyal father, whether that blessed monarch had ever one anxious thought\r\nfor the public, or disappointment, or uneasiness, or want of money for\r\nall his occasions, during the time of my administration? And, how happy\r\nthe people confessed themselves to be under such a king, I leave to\r\ntheir own numerous addresses; which all politicians will allow to be the\r\nmost infallible proof how any nation stands affected to their\r\nsovereign.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLelop-Aw, having ended his speech and struck his forehead thrice against\r\nthe table, as the custom is in Japan, sat down with great complacency of\r\nmind, and much applause of his adherents, as might be observed by their\r\ncountenances and their whispers. But the Emperor's behaviour was\r\nremarkable; for, during the whole harangue, he appeared equally\r\nattentive and uneasy. After a short pause, His Majesty commanded that\r\nsome other counsellor should deliver his thoughts, either to confirm or\r\nobject against what had been spoken by Lelop-Aw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER OF THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM PULTENEY, ESQ., TO THE\r\nRIGHT HON. SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.[216]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Oct. 15, 1730.\r\n SIR,\r\n\r\nA pamphlet was lately sent me, entitled, \"A Letter from the Right\r\nHonourable Sir R. W. to the Right Honourable W. P. Esq; occasioned by the\r\nlate Invectives on the King, her Majesty, and all the Royal Family.\" By\r\nthese initial letters of our names, the world is to understand that you\r\nand I must be meant. Although the letter seems to require an answer, yet\r\nbecause it appears to be written rather in the style and manner used by\r\nsome of your pensioners, than your own, I shall allow you the liberty to\r\nthink the same of this answer, and leave the public to determine which\r\nof the two actors can better personate their principals. That frigid and\r\nfustian way of haranguing wherewith your representer begins, continues,\r\nand ends his declamation, I shall leave to the critics in eloquence and\r\npropriety to descant on; because it adds nothing to the weight of your\r\naccusations, nor will my defence be one grain the better by exposing its\r\npuerilities.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore only remark upon this particular, that the frauds and\r\ncorruptions in most other arts and sciences, as law, physic (I shall\r\nproceed no further) are usually much more plausibly defended than in\r\nthat of politics; whether it be, that by a kind of fatality the\r\nvindication of a corrupt minister is always left to the management of\r\nthe meanest and most prostitute writers; or whether it be, that the\r\neffects of a wicked or unskilful administration, are more public,\r\nvisible, pernicious and universal. Whereas the mistakes in other\r\nsciences are often matters that affect only speculation; or at worst,\r\nthe bad consequences fall upon few and private persons. A nation is\r\nquickly sensible of the miseries it feels, and little comforted by\r\nknowing what account it turns to by the wealth, the power, the honours\r\nconferred on those who sit at the helm, or the salaries paid to their\r\npenmen; while the body of the people is sunk into poverty and despair. A\r\nFrenchman in his wooden shoes may, from the vanity of his nation, and\r\nthe constitution of that government, conceive some imaginary pleasure in\r\nboasting the grandeur of his monarch, in the midst of his own slavery;\r\nbut a free-born Englishman, with all his loyalty, can find little\r\nsatisfaction at a minister overgrown in wealth and power from the lowest\r\ndegree of want and contempt; when that power or wealth are drawn from\r\nthe bowels and blood of the nation, for which every fellow-subject is a\r\nsufferer, except the great man himself, his family, and his pensioners.\r\nI mean such a minister (if there hath ever been such a one) whose whole\r\nmanagement hath been a continued link of ignorance, blunders, and\r\nmistakes in every article besides that of enriching and aggrandizing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the faults of men, who are most trusted in public\r\nbusiness, are, of all others, the most difficult to be defended. A man\r\nmay be persuaded into a wrong opinion, wherein he hath small concern:\r\nbut no oratory can have the power over a sober man against the\r\nconviction of his own senses: and therefore, as I take it, the money\r\nthrown away on such advocates might be more prudently spared, and kept\r\nin such a minister's own pocket, than lavished in hiring a corporation\r\nof pamphleteers to defend his conduct, and prove a kingdom to be\r\nflourishing in trade and wealth, which every particular subject (except\r\nthose few already excepted) can lawfully swear, and, by dear experience\r\nknows, to be a falsehood.\r\n\r\nGive me leave, noble sir, in the way of argument, to suppose this to be\r\nyour case; could you in good conscience, or moral justice, chide your\r\npaper-advocates for their ill success in persuading the world against\r\nmanifest demonstration? Their miscarriage is owing, alas! to want of\r\nmatter. Should we allow them to be masters of wit, raillery, or\r\nlearning, yet the subject would not admit them to exercise their\r\ntalents; and, consequently, they can have no recourse but to impudence,\r\nlying, and scurrility.\r\n\r\nI must confess, that the author of your letter to me hath carried this\r\nlast qualification to a greater height than any of his fellows: but he\r\nhath, in my opinion, failed a little in point of politeness from the\r\noriginal which he affects to imitate. If I should say to a prime\r\nminister, \"Sir, you have sufficiently provided that Dunkirk should be\r\nabsolutely demolished and never repaired; you took the best advantages\r\nof a long and general peace to discharge the immense debts of the\r\nnation; you did wonders with the fleet; you made the Spaniards submit to\r\nour quiet possession of Gibraltar and Portmahon; you never enriched\r\nyourself and family at the expense of the public.\"--Such is the style of\r\nyour supposed letter, which however, if I am well informed, by no means\r\ncomes up to the refinements of a fishwife in Billingsgate. \"You never\r\nhad a bastard by Tom the waterman; you never stole a silver tankard; you\r\nwere never whipped at the cart's tail.\"\r\n\r\nIn the title of your letter, it is said to be \"occasioned by the late\r\ninvectives on the King, her Majesty, and all the Royal Family:\" and the\r\nwhole contents of the paper (stripped from your eloquence) goes on upon\r\na supposition affectedly serious, that their Majesties, and the whole\r\nRoyal Family, have been lately bitterly and publicly inveighed against\r\nin the most enormous and treasonable manner. Now, being a man, as you\r\nwell know, altogether out of business, I do sometimes lose an hour in\r\nreading a few of those controversial papers upon politics, which have\r\nsucceeded for some years past to the polemical tracts between Whig and\r\nTory: and in this kind of reading (if it may deserve to be so called)\r\nalthough I have been often but little edified, or entertained, yet hath\r\nit given me occasion to make some observations. First, I have observed,\r\nthat however men may sincerely agree in all the branches of the Low\r\nChurch principle, in a tenderness for dissenters of every kind, in a\r\nperfect abhorrence of Popery and the Pretender, and in the most firm\r\nadherence to the Protestant succession in the royal house of Hanover;\r\nyet plenty of matter may arise to kindle their animosities against each\r\nother from the various infirmities, follies, and vices inherent in\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I observed, that although the vulgar reproach which charges\r\nthe quarrels between ministers, and their opposers, to be only a\r\ncontention for power between those who are in, and those who would be in\r\nif they could; yet as long as this proceeds no further than a scuffle of\r\nambition among a few persons, it is only a matter of course, whereby the\r\npublic is little affected. But when corruptions are plain, open, and\r\nundisguised, both in their causes and effects, to the hazard of a\r\nnation's ruin, and so declared by all the principal persons and the bulk\r\nof the people, those only excepted who are gainers by those corruptions:\r\nand when such ministers are forced to fly for shelter to the throne,\r\nwith a complaint of disaffection to majesty against all who durst\r\ndislike their administration: such a general disposition in the minds of\r\nmen, cannot, I think, by any rules of reason, be called the \"clamour of\r\na few disaffected incendiaries,\" gasping[217] after power. It is the\r\ntrue voice of the people; which must and will at last be heard, or\r\nproduce consequences that I dare not mention.\r\n\r\nI have observed thirdly, that among all the offensive printed papers\r\nwhich have come to my hand, whether good or bad, the writers have taken\r\nparticular pains to celebrate the virtues of our excellent King and\r\nQueen, even where these were, strictly speaking, no part of the subject:\r\nnor can it be properly objected that such a proceeding was only a blind\r\nto cover their malice towards you and your assistants; because to\r\naffront the King, Queen, or the Royal Family, as it would be directly\r\nopposite to the principles that those kind of writers have always\r\nprofessed, so it would destroy the very end they have in pursuit. And it\r\nis somewhat remarkable, that those very writers against you, and the\r\nregiment you command, are such as most distinguish themselves upon all,\r\nor upon no occasions, by their panegyrics on their prince; and, as all\r\nof them do this without favour or hire, so some of them continue the\r\nsame practice under the severest prosecution by you and your janizaries.\r\n\r\nYou seem to know, or at least very strongly to conjecture, who those\r\npersons are that give you so much weekly disquiet. Will you dare to\r\nassert that any of these are Jacobites, endeavour to alienate the hearts\r\nof the people, to defame the prince, and then dethrone him (for these\r\nare your expressions) and that I am their patron, their bulwark, their\r\nhope, and their refuge? Can you think I will descend to vindicate myself\r\nagainst an aspersion so absurd? God be thanked, we have had many a\r\nchange of ministry without changing our prince: for if it had been\r\notherwise, perhaps revolutions might have been more frequent. Heaven\r\nforbid that the welfare of a great kingdom, and of a brave people,\r\nshould be trusted with the thread of a single subject's life; for I\r\nsuppose it is not yet in your view to entail the ministryship in your\r\nfamily. Thus I hope we may live to see different ministers and different\r\nmeasures, without any danger to the succession in the royal Protestant\r\nline of Hanover.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to advance a topic, which I could never heartily approve\r\nof in any party, although they have each in their turn advanced it while\r\nthey had the superiority. You tell us, \"It is hard that while every\r\nprivate man shall have the liberty to choose what servants he pleaseth,\r\nthe same privilege should be refused to a king.\" This assertion, crudely\r\nunderstood, can hardly be supported. If by servants be only meant those\r\nwho are purely menial, who provide for their master's food and clothing,\r\nor for the convenience and splendour of his family, the point is not\r\nworth debating. But the bad or good choice of a chancellor, a secretary,\r\nan ambassador, a treasurer, and many other officers, is of very high\r\nconsequence to the whole kingdom; so is likewise that amphibious race of\r\ncourtiers between servants and ministers; such as the steward,\r\nchamberlain, treasurer of the household and the like, being all of the\r\nprivy council, and some of the cabinet, who according to their talents,\r\ntheir principles, and their degree of favour, may be great instruments\r\nof good or evil, both to the subject and the prince; so that the\r\nparallel is by no means adequate between a prince's court and a private\r\nfamily. And yet if an insolent footman be troublesome in the\r\nneighbourhood; if he breaks the people's windows, insults their\r\nservants, breaks into other folk's houses to pilfer what he can find,\r\nalthough he belong to a duke, and be a favourite in his station, yet\r\nthose who are injured may, without just offence, complain to his lord,\r\nand for want of redress get a warrant to send him to the stocks, to\r\nBridewell, or to Newgate, according to the nature and degree of his\r\ndelinquencies. Thus the servants of the prince, whether menial or\r\notherwise, if they be of his council, are subject to the enquiries and\r\nprosecutions of the great council of the nation, even as far as to\r\ncapital punishment; and so must ever be in our constitution, till a\r\nminister can procure a majority even of that council to shelter him;\r\nwhich I am sure you will allow to be a desperate crisis under any party\r\nof the most plausible denomination.\r\n\r\nThe only instance you produce, or rather insinuate, to prove the late\r\ninvectives against the King, Queen, and Royal Family, is drawn from that\r\ndeduction of the English history, published in several papers by the\r\n_Craftsman_; wherein are shewn the bad consequences to the public, as\r\nwell as to the prince, from the practices of evil ministers in most\r\nreigns, and at several periods, when the throne was filled by wise\r\nmonarchs as well as by weak. This deduction, therefore, cannot\r\nreasonably give the least offence to a British king, when he shall\r\nobserve that the greatest and ablest of his predecessors, by their own\r\ncandour, by a particular juncture of affairs, or by the general\r\ninfirmity of human nature, have sometimes put too much trust in\r\nconfident, insinuating, and avaricious ministers.\r\n\r\nWisdom, attended by virtue and a generous nature, is not unapt to be\r\nimposed on. Thus Milton describes Uriel, \"the sharpest-sighted spirit in\r\nheaven,\" and \"regent of the sun,\" deceived by the dissimulation and\r\nflattery of the devil, for which the poet gives a philosophical reason,\r\nbut needless here to quote.[218] Is anything more common, or more\r\nuseful, than to caution wise men in high stations against putting too\r\nmuch trust in undertaking servants, cringing flatterers, or designing\r\nfriends? Since the Asiatic custom of governing by prime ministers hath\r\nprevailed in so many courts of Europe, how careful should every prince\r\nbe in the choice of the person on whom so great a trust is devolved,\r\nwhereon depend the safety and welfare of himself and all his subjects.\r\nQueen Elizabeth, whose administration is frequently quoted as the best\r\npattern for English princes to follow, could not resist the artifices of\r\nthe Earl of Leicester, who, although universally allowed to be the most\r\nambitious, insolent, and corrupt person of his age, was yet her\r\ngreatest, and almost her only favourite: (his religion indeed being\r\npartly puritan and partly infidel, might have better tallied with\r\npresent times) yet this wise queen would never suffer the openest\r\nenemies of that overgrown lord to be sacrificed to his vengeance; nor\r\ndurst he charge them with a design of introducing Popery or the Spanish\r\npretender.\r\n\r\nHow many great families do we all know, whose masters have passed for\r\npersons of good abilities, during the whole course of their lives, and\r\nyet the greatest part of whose estates have sunk in the hands of their\r\nstewards and receivers; their revenues paid them in scanty portions, at\r\nlarge discount, and treble interest, though they did not know it; while\r\nthe tenants were daily racked, and at the same time accused to their\r\nlandlords of insolvency. Of this species are such managers, who, like\r\nhonest Peter Waters, pretend to clear an estate, keep the owner\r\npenniless, and, after seven years, leave him five times more in debt,\r\nwhile they sink half a plum into their own pockets.\r\n\r\nThose who think themselves concerned, may give you thanks for that\r\ngracious liberty you are pleased to allow them of \"taking vengeance on\r\nthe ministers, and there shooting their envenomed arrows.\" As to myself;\r\nI neither owe you vengeance, nor make use of such weapons: but it is\r\nyour weakness, or ill fortune, or perhaps the fault of your\r\nconstitution, to convert wholesome remedies into poison; for you have\r\nreceived better and more frequent instructions than any minister of your\r\nage and country, if God had given you the grace to apply them.\r\n\r\nI dare promise you the thanks of half the kingdom, if you will please to\r\nperform the promise you have made of suffering the _Craftsman_ and\r\ncompany, or whatever other \"infamous wretches and execrable villains\"\r\nyou mean, to take their vengeance only on your own sacred ministerial\r\nperson, without bringing any of your brethren, much less the most remote\r\nbranch of the Royal Family, into the debate. This generous offer I\r\nsuspected from the first; because there were never heard of so many, so\r\nunnecessary, and so severe prosecutions as you have promoted during your\r\nministry, in a kingdom where the liberty of the press is so much\r\npretended to be allowed. But in reading a page or two, I found you\r\nthought it proper to explain away your grant; for there you tell us,\r\nthat \"these miscreants\" (meaning the writers against you) \"are to\r\nremember that the laws have ABUNDANTLY LESS generous, less mild\r\nand merciful sentiments\" than yourself, and into their secular hands the\r\npoor authors must be delivered to fines, prisons, pillories, whippings,\r\nand the gallows. Thus your promise of impunity, which began somewhat\r\njesuitically, concludes with the mercy of a Spanish inquisitor.\r\n\r\nIf it should so happen that I am neither \"abettor, patron, protector,\"\r\nnor \"supporter\" of these imaginary invectives \"against the King, her\r\nMajesty, or any of the Royal Family,\" I desire to know what\r\nsatisfaction I am to get from you, or the creature you employed in\r\nwriting the libel which I am now answering? It will be no excuse to\r\nsay, that I differ from you in every particular of your political\r\nreason and practise; because that will be to load the best, the\r\nsoundest, and most numerous part of the kingdom with the denominations\r\nyou are pleased to bestow upon me, that they are \"Jacobites, wicked\r\nmiscreants, infamous wretches, execrable villains, and defamers of the\r\nKing, Queen, and all the Royal Family,\" and \"guilty of high treason.\"\r\nYou cannot know my style; but I can easily know your works, which are\r\nperformed in the sight of the sun. Your good inclinations are\r\nvisible; but I begin to doubt the strength of your credit, even at\r\ncourt, that you have not power to make his Majesty believe me the\r\nperson which you represent in your libel: as most infallibly you have\r\noften attempted, and in vain, because I must otherwise have found it\r\nby the marks of his royal displeasure. However, to be angry with you\r\nto whom I am indebted for the greatest obligation I could possibly\r\nreceive, would be the highest ingratitude. It is to YOU I owe that\r\nreputation I have acquired for some years past of being a lover of my\r\ncountry and its constitution: to YOU I owe the libels and scurrilities\r\nconferred upon me by the worst of men, and consequently some degree of\r\nesteem and friendship from the best. From YOU I learned the skill of\r\ndistinguishing between a patriot and a plunderer of his country: and\r\nfrom YOU I hope in time to acquire the knowledge of being a loyal,\r\nfaithful, and useful servant to the best of princes, King George the\r\nSecond; and therefore I can conclude, by your example, but with\r\ngreater truth, that I am not only with humble submission and respect,\r\nbut with infinite gratitude, Sir, your most obedient and most obliged\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n                                                    W.

In reality, it had been the outcome of the legislation\r\nagainst the Irish Roman Catholics. In 1703 the Irish parliament had\r\npassed a bill by which it was enacted, \"that all estates should be\r\nequally divided among the children of Roman Catholics, notwithstanding\r\nany settlements to the contrary, unless the persons to whom they were to\r\ndescend, would qualify, by taking the oaths prescribed by government,\r\nand conform to the established church\" (Crawford's \"History of Ireland,\"\r\n1783, vol. ii., p. 256). The bill was transmitted to England, for\r\napproval there, at a time when Anne was asking the Emperor for his\r\nindulgence towards the Protestants of his realms. This placed the Queen\r\nin an awkward position, since she could hardly expect indulgence from a\r\nRoman Catholic monarch towards Protestants when she, a Protestant\r\nmonarch, was persecuting Roman Catholics. To obviate this dilemma, the\r\nQueen's ministers added a clause to the bill, \"by which all persons in\r\nIreland were rendered incapable of any employment under the crown, or,\r\nof being magistrates in any city, who, agreeably to the English test\r\nact, did not receive the sacrament as prescribed by the Church of\r\nEngland\" (_ibid._). Under this clause, of course, came all the\r\nProtestant Dissenters, including the Presbyterians \"from the north.\" The\r\nbill so amended passed into law; but its iniquitous influence was a\r\ndisgrace to the legislators of the day, and his advocacy of it, however\r\nmuch he was convinced of its expediency, proves Swift a short-sighted\r\nstatesman wherever the enemies of the Church of England were concerned.\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[4] Colonel John Birch (1616-1691) was of Lancashire. Swift calls him\r\n\"of Herefordshire,\" because he had been appointed governor of the city\r\nof Hereford, after he had captured it by a stratagem, in 1654. Devotedly\r\nattached to Presbyterian principles, Birch was a man of shrewd business\r\nabilities and remarkable oratorical gifts. On the restoration of Charles\r\nII., in which he took a prominent part on account of Charles's\r\nchampionship of Presbyterianism, Birch held important business posts. He\r\nsat in parliament for Leominster and Penrhyn, and his plans for the\r\nrebuilding of London after the Great Fire, though they were not adopted,\r\nwere yet such as would have been extremely salutary had they been\r\naccepted. Of his eloquence, Burnet says: \"He was the roughest and\r\nboldest speaker in the house, and talked in the language and phrases of\r\na carrier, but with a beauty and eloquence, that was always acceptable.\"\r\nThe reference to the carrier is purposely made, since Birch did not hide\r\nthe fact that he had once pursued that occupation. Swift was twenty-four\r\nyears of age when Birch died, so that he must have been a very young man\r\nwhen he heard Birch make the remark he quotes. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[5] Sir Thomas Littleton (1647?-1710) was chosen Speaker of the English\r\nHouse of Commons by the junto in 1698. Onslow, in a note to Burnet's\r\n\"History,\" speaks of the good work he did as treasurer of the navy.\r\nMacky describes him as \"a stern-looked man, with a brown complexion,\r\nwell shaped\" (see \"Characters\"). At the time of Swift's writing the\r\nabove letter, Littleton was member for Portsmouth. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[6] Viscount Molesworth, in his \"Considerations for promoting the\r\nAgriculture of Ireland\" (1723), pointed out, that even with the added\r\nexpense of freight, it was cheaper to import corn from England, than to\r\ngrow it in Ireland itself. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. Lecky points out that in England, after the Revolution, the\r\ncouncils were directed by commercial influence. At that time there was\r\nan important woollen industry in England which, it was feared, the\r\ngrowing Irish woollen manufactures would injure. The English\r\nmanufacturers petitioned for their total destruction, and the House of\r\nLords, in response to the petition, represented to the King that \"the\r\ngrowing manufacture of cloth in Ireland, both by the cheapness of all\r\nsorts of necessaries of life, and goodness of materials for making all\r\nmanner of cloth, doth invite your subjects of England, with their\r\nfamilies and servants, to leave their habitations to settle there, to\r\nthe increase of the woollen manufacture in Ireland, which makes your\r\nloyal subjects in this kingdom very apprehensive that the further growth\r\nof it may greatly prejudice the said manufacture here.\" The Commons went\r\nfurther, and suggested the advisability of discouraging the industry by\r\nhindering the exportation of wool from Ireland to other countries and\r\nlimiting it to England alone. The Act of 10 and 11 Will. III. c. 10,\r\nmade the suggestion law and even prohibited entirely the exportation of\r\nIrish wool anywhere. Thus, as Swift puts it, \"the politic gentlemen of\r\nIreland have depopulated vast tracts of the best land, for the feeding\r\nof sheep.\" See notes to later tracts in this volume on \"Observations on\r\nthe Woollen Manufactures\" and \"Letter on the Weavers.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[8] That Swift did not exaggerate may be gathered from the statute\r\nbooks, and, more immediately, from Hely Hutchinson's \"Commercial\r\nRestraints of Ireland\" (1779), Arthur Dobbs's \"Trade and Improvement of\r\nIreland,\" Lecky's \"History of Ireland,\" vols. i. and ii., and Monck\r\nMason's notes in his \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" p. 320 _et\r\nseq._ [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[9] Barnstaple was, at that time, the chief market in England for Irish\r\nwool. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[10] In 1726, Swift presented some pieces of Irish manufactured silk to\r\nthe Princess of Wales and to Mrs. Howard. In sending the silk to Mrs.\r\nHoward he wrote also a letter in which he remarked: \"I beg you will not\r\ntell any parliament man from whence you had that plaid; otherwise, out\r\nof malice, they will make a law to cut off all our weavers' fingers.\"\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[11] This last sentence is as the original edition has it. In Faulkner's\r\nfirst collected edition and in the fifth volume of the \"Miscellanies\"\r\n(London, 1735), the following occurs in its place: \"I must confess, that\r\nas to the former, I should not be sorry if they would stay at home; and\r\nfor the latter, I hope, in a little time we shall have no occasion for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nSwift knew what he was advising when he suggested that the people of\r\nIreland should not import their goods from England. He was well aware\r\nthat English manufactures were not really necessary. Sir William Petty\r\nhad, a half century before, pointed out that a third of the manufactures\r\nthen imported into Ireland could be produced by its own factories,\r\nanother third could as easily and as cheaply be obtained from countries\r\nother than England, and \"consequently, that it was scarce necessary at\r\nall for Ireland to receive any goods of England, and not convenient to\r\nreceive above one-fourth part, from thence, of the whole which it\r\nneedeth to import\" (\"Polit. Anatomy of Ireland,\" 1672). [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[12] Faulkner and the \"Miscellanies\" (London, 1735) print, instead of,\r\n\"as any prelate in Christendom,\" the words, \"as if he had not been born\r\namong us.\" The Archbishop was Dr. William King, with whom Swift had had\r\nmuch correspondence. See \"Letters\" in Scott's edition (1824).\r\n\r\nDr. William King, who succeeded Narcissus Marsh as Archbishop of Dublin\r\nin March, 1702-3. Swift had not always been on friendly terms with King,\r\nbut, at this time, they were in sympathy as to the wrongs and grievances\r\nof Ireland. King strongly supported the agitation against Wood's\r\nhalfpence, but later, when he attempted to interfere with the affairs of\r\nthe Deanery of St. Patrick's, Swift and he came to an open rupture. See\r\nalso volume on the Drapier's Letters, in this edition. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[13] Faulkner and the \"Miscellanies\" of 1735 print this amount as \"three\r\nthousand six hundred.\" This was the sum paid by the lord-lieutenant to\r\nthe lords-justices, who represented him in the government of Ireland.\r\nThe lord-lieutenant himself did not then, as the viceroy of Ireland does\r\nnow, take up his residence in the country. Although in receipt of a\r\nlarge salary, he only came to Dublin to deliver the speeches at the\r\nopenings of parliament, or on some other special occasion. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[14] The Dublin edition of this pamphlet has a note stating that Cotter\r\nwas a gentleman of Cork who was executed for committing a rape on a\r\nQuaker. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[15] Said to be Colonel Bladon (1680-1746), who translated the\r\nCommentaries of Cæsar. He was a dependant of the Duke of Marlborough, to\r\nwhom he dedicated this translation. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[16] Lord Grimston. William Luckyn, first Viscount Grimston (1683-1756),\r\nwas created an Irish peer with the title Baron Dunboyne in 1719. The\r\nfull title of the play to which Swift refers, is \"The Lawyer's Fortune,\r\nor, Love in a Hollow Tree.\" It was published in 1705. Swift refers to\r\nGrimston in his verses \"On Poetry, a Rhapsody.\" Pope, in one of his\r\nsatires, calls him \"booby lord.\" Grimston withdrew his play from\r\ncirculation after the second edition, but it was reprinted in Rotterdam\r\nin 1728 and in London in 1736. Dr. Johnson told Chesterfield a story\r\nwhich made the Duchess of Marlborough responsible for this London\r\nreprint, which had for frontispiece the picture of an ass wearing a\r\ncoronet. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[17] The original edition prints \"ministers\" instead of \"chief\r\ngovernors.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[18] In 1720 Bishop Nicholson of Derry, writing to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, describes the wretched condition of the towns and the\r\ncountry districts, and the misery of their population:\r\n\r\n\"Our trade of all kind is at a stand, insomuch as that our most eminent\r\nmerchants, who used to pay bills of _1,000l._ at sight, are hardly able\r\nto raise _100l._ in so many days. Spindles of yarn (our daily bread) are\r\nfallen from _2s. 6d._ to _15d._, and everything also in proportion.\r\nOur best beef (as good as I ever ate in England) is sold under _3/4d._ a\r\npound, and all this not from any extraordinary plenty of commodities,\r\nbut from a perfect dearth of money. Never did I behold even in Picardy,\r\nWestphalia, or Scotland, such dismal marks of hunger and want as\r\nappeared in the countenances of most of the poor creatures I met with on\r\nthe road.\" (Brit. Mus. Add. MSS. 6116, quoted by Lecky.) [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[19] The \"absentee\" landlord was an evil to Ireland on which much has\r\nbeen written. It was difficult to keep the country in order when the\r\nlanded proprietors took so little interest in their possessions as to do\r\nnothing but exact rents from their tenants and spend the money so\r\nobtained in England. Two, and even three, hundred years before Swift's\r\nday \"absenteeism\" had been the cause of much of the rebellion in Ireland\r\nwhich harassed the English monarchs, who endeavoured to put a stop to\r\nthe evil by confiscating the estates of such landlords. Acts were passed\r\nby Richard II. and Henry VIII. to this effect; but in later times, the\r\nstatutes were ignored and not enforced, and the Irish landlord, in\r\nendeavours to obtain for himself social recognition and standing in\r\nEngland which, because of his Irish origin, were denied him, remained in\r\nEngland indulging himself in lavish expenditure and display. The\r\nconsequences of this were the impoverishment of his estates and their\r\neventual management by rack-renters. These rack-renters, whose only\r\ninterest lay in squeezing money out of the impoverished tenants, became\r\nthe bane of the agricultural holder.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the spirit of \"absenteeism\" extended itself to the\r\nholders of offices in Ireland, and even the lord-lieutenant rarely took\r\nup his residence in Dublin for any time longer than necessitated by the\r\nimmediate demands of his installation and speech-making, although he\r\ndrew his emoluments from the Irish revenues. In the \"List of Absentees\"\r\ninstances are given where men appointed to Irish offices would land on\r\nSaturday night, receive the sacrament on Sunday, take the oath in court\r\non Monday morning, and be on their way back to England by Monday\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that out of a total rental of £1,800,000, as much\r\nas 33-1/3 per cent. was sent out of the country. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[20] Sheridan, in the sixth number of \"The Intelligencer,\" contributes\r\nan account of the state of Ireland, written to the text, \"O patria! O\r\ndivûm domus!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I travel through any part of this unhappy kingdom, and I have now\r\nby several excursions made from Dublin, gone through most counties of\r\nit, it raises two passions in my breast of a different kind; an\r\nindignation against those vile betrayers and insulters of it, who\r\ninsinuate themselves into favour, by saying, it is a rich nation; and a\r\nsincere passion for the natives, who are sunk to the lowest degree of\r\nmisery and poverty, whose houses are dunghills, whose victuals are the\r\nblood of their cattle, or the herbs in the field; and whose clothing, to\r\nthe dishonour of God and man, is nakedness. Yet notwithstanding all the\r\ndismal appearances, it is the common phrase of our upstart race of\r\npeople, who have suddenly sprang up like the dragon's teeth among us,\r\n_That Ireland was never known to be so rich as it is now_; by which, as\r\nI apprehend, they can only mean themselves, for they have skipped over\r\nthe channel from the vantage ground of a dunghill upon no other merit,\r\neither visible or divineable, than that of not having been born among\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"This is the modern way of planting Colonies--Et ubi solitudinem\r\nfaciunt, id Imperium vocant. When those who are so unfortunate to be\r\nborn here, are excluded from the meanest preferments, and deemed\r\nincapable of being entertained even as common soldiers, whose poor\r\nstipend is but four pence a day. No trade, no emoluments, no\r\nencouragement for learning among the natives, who yet by a perverse\r\nconsequence are divided into factions, with as much violence and\r\nrancour, as if they had the wealth of the Indies to contend for. It puts\r\nme in mind of a fable which I read in a monkish author. He quotes for it\r\none of the Greek mythologists that once upon a time a colony of large\r\ndogs (called the Molossi) transplanted themselves from Epirus to Ætolia,\r\nwhere they seized those parts of the countries, most fertile in flesh of\r\nall kinds, obliging the native dogs to retire from their best kennels,\r\nto live under ditches and bushes, but to preserve good neighbourhood and\r\npeace; and finding likewise, that the Ætolian dogs might be of some use\r\nin the low offices of life, they passed a decree, that the natives\r\nshould be entitled to the short ribs, tops of back, knuckle-bones, and\r\nguts of all the game, which they were obliged by their masters to run\r\ndown. This condition was accepted, and what was a little singular, while\r\nthe Molossian dogs kept a good understanding among themselves, living in\r\npeace and luxury, these Ætolian curs were perpetually snarling,\r\ngrowling, barking and tearing at each other's throats: Nay, sometimes\r\nthose of the best quality among them, were seen to quarrel with as much\r\nrancour for a rotten gut, as if it had been a fat haunch of venison. But\r\nwhat need we wonder at this in dogs, when the same is every day\r\npractised among men?\r\n\r\n\"Last year I travelled from Dublin to Dundalk, through a country\r\nesteemed the most fruitful part of the kingdom, and so nature intended\r\nit. But no ornaments or improvements of such a scene were visible. No\r\nhabitation fit for gentlemen, no farmers' houses, few fields of corn,\r\nand almost a bare face of nature, without new plantations of any kind,\r\nonly a few miserable cottages, at three or four miles' distance, and one\r\nChurch in the centre between this city and Drogheda. When I arrived at\r\nthis last town, the first mortifying sight was the ruins of several\r\nchurches, battered down by that usurper, Cromwell, whose fanatic zeal\r\nmade more desolation in a few days, than the piety of succeeding\r\nprelates or the wealth of the town have, in more than sixty years,\r\nattempted to repair.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the inhabitants, through a high strain of virtue, have, in\r\nimitation of the Athenians, made a solemn resolution, never to rebuild\r\nthose sacred edifices, but rather leave them in ruins, as monuments, to\r\nperpetuate the detestable memory of that hellish instrument of\r\nrebellion, desolation, and murder. For the Athenians, when Mardonius had\r\nravaged a great part of Greece, took a formal oath at the Isthmus, to\r\nlose their lives rather than their liberty, to stand by their leaders to\r\nthe last, to spare the cities of such barbarians as they conquered. And\r\nwhat crowned all, the conclusion of their oath was, We will never repair\r\nany of the Temples, which they have burned and destroyed, lest they may\r\nappear to posterity as so many monuments of these wicked barbarians.\r\nThis was a glorious resolution; and I am sorry to think, that the\r\npoverty of my countrymen will not let the world suppose, they have acted\r\nupon such a generous principle; yet upon this occasion I cannot but\r\nobserve, that there is a fatality in some nations, to be fond of those\r\nwho have treated them with the least humanity. Thus I have often heard\r\nthe memory of Cromwell, who has depopulated, and almost wholly destroyed\r\nthis miserable country, celebrated like that of a saint, and at the same\r\ntime the sufferings of the royal martyr turned into ridicule, and his\r\nmurder justified even from the pulpit, and all this done with an intent\r\nto gain favour, under a monarchy; which is a new strain of politics that\r\nI shall not pretend to account for.\r\n\r\n\"Examine all the eastern towns of Ireland, and you will trace this\r\nhorrid instrument of destruction, in defacing of Churches, and\r\nparticularly in destroying whatever was ornamental, either within or\r\nwithout them. We see in the several towns a very few houses scattered\r\namong the ruins of thousands, which he laid level with their streets;\r\ngreat numbers of castles, the country seats of gentlemen then in being,\r\nstill standing in ruin, habitations for bats, daws, and owls, without\r\nthe least repairs or succession of other buildings. Nor have the country\r\nchurches, as far as my eye could reach, met with any better treatment\r\nfrom him, nine in ten of them lying among their graves and God only\r\nknows when they are to have a resurrection. When I passed from Dundalk\r\nwhere this cursed usurper's handy work is yet visible, I cast mine eyes\r\naround from the top of a mountain, from whence I had a wide and a waste\r\nprospect of several venerable ruins. It struck me with a melancholy, not\r\nunlike that expressed by Cicero in one of his letters which being much\r\nupon the like prospect, and concluding with a very necessary reflection\r\non the uncertainty of things in this world, I shall here insert a\r\ntranslation of what he says: 'In my return from Asia, as I sailed from\r\nÆgina, towards Megara, I began to take a prospect of the several\r\ncountries round me. Behind me was Ægina; before me Megara; on the right\r\nhand the Piræus; and on the left was Corinth; which towns were formerly\r\nin a most flourishing condition; now they lie prostrate and in ruin.\r\n\r\n\"'Thus I began to think with myself: Shall we who have but a trifling\r\nexistence, express any resentment, when one of us either dies a natural\r\ndeath, or is slain, whose lives are necessarily of a short duration,\r\nwhen at one view I beheld the carcases of so many great cities?' What if\r\nhe had seen the natives of those free republics, reduced to all the\r\nmiserable consequences of a conquered people, living without the common\r\ndefences against hunger and cold, rather appearing like spectres than\r\nmen? I am apt to think, that seeing his fellow creatures in ruin like\r\nthis, it would have put him past all patience for philosophic\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\"As for my own part, I confess, that the sights and occurrences which I\r\nhad in this my last journey, so far transported me to a mixture of rage\r\nand compassion, that I am not able to decide, which had the greater\r\ninfluence upon my spirits; for this new cant, of a rich and flourishing\r\nnation, was still uppermost in my thoughts; every mile I travelled,\r\ngiving me such ample demonstrations to the contrary. For this reason, I\r\nhave been at the pains to render a most exact and faithful account of\r\nall the visible signs of riches, which I met with in sixty miles' riding\r\nthrough the most public roads, and the best part of the kingdom. First,\r\nas to trade, I met nine cars loaden with old musty, shrivelled hides;\r\none car-load of butter; four jockeys driving eight horses, all out of\r\ncase; one cow and calf driven by a man and his wife; six tattered\r\nfamilies flitting to be shipped off to the West Indies; a colony of a\r\nhundred and fifty beggars, all repairing to people our metropolis, and\r\nby encreasing the number of hands, to encrease its wealth, upon the old\r\nmaxim, that people are the riches of a nation, and therefore ten\r\nthousand mouths, with hardly ten pair of hands, or hardly any work to\r\nemploy them, will infallibly make us a rich and flourishing people.\r\nSecondly, Travellers enough, but seven in ten wanting shirts and\r\ncravats; nine in ten going bare foot, and carrying their brogues and\r\nstockings in their hands; one woman in twenty having a pillion, the rest\r\nriding bare backed: Above two hundred horsemen, with four pair of boots\r\namongst them all; seventeen saddles of leather (the rest being made of\r\nstraw) and most of their garrons only shod before. I went into one of\r\nthe principal farmer's houses, out of curiosity, and his whole furniture\r\nconsisted of two blocks for stools, a bench on each side the fire-place\r\nmade of turf, six trenchers, one bowl, a pot, six horn spoons, three\r\nnoggins, three blankets, one of which served the man and maid servant;\r\nthe other the master of the family, his wife and five children; a small\r\nchurn, a wooden candlestick, a broken stick for a pair of tongs. In the\r\npublic towns, one third of the inhabitants walking the streets bare\r\nfoot; windows half built up with stone, to save the expense of glass,\r\nthe broken panes up and down supplied by brown paper, few being able to\r\nafford white; in some places they were stopped with straw or hay.\r\nAnother mark of our riches, are the signs at the several inns upon the\r\nroad, viz. In some, a staff stuck in the thatch, with a turf at the end\r\nof it; a staff in a dunghill with a white rag wrapped about the head; a\r\npole, where they can afford it, with a besom at the top; an oatmeal cake\r\non a board at the window; and, at the principal inns of the road, I have\r\nobserved the signs taken down and laid against the wall near the door,\r\nbeing taken from their post to prevent the shaking of the house down by\r\nthe wind. In short, I saw not one single house, in the best town I\r\ntravelled through, which had not manifest appearances of beggary and\r\nwant. I could give many more instances of our wealth, but I hope these\r\nwill suffice for the end I propose.\r\n\r\n\"It may be objected, what use it is of to display the poverty of the\r\nnation, in the manner I have done. I answer, I desire to know for what\r\nends, and by what persons, this new opinion of our flourishing state has\r\nof late been so industriously advanced: One thing is certain, that the\r\nadvancers have either already found their own account, or have been\r\nheartily promised, or at least have been entertained with hopes, by\r\nseeing such an opinion pleasing to those who have it in their power to\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n\"It is no doubt a very generous principle in any person to rejoice in\r\nthe felicities of a nation, where themselves are strangers or\r\nsojourners: But if it be found that the same persons on all other\r\noccasions express a hatred and contempt of the nation and people in\r\ngeneral, and hold it for a maxim--'That the more such a country is\r\nhumbled, the more their own will rise'; it need be no longer a secret,\r\nwhy such an opinion, and the advantages of it are encouraged. And\r\nbesides, if the bayliff reports to his master, that the ox is fat and\r\nstrong, when in reality it can hardly carry its own legs, is it not\r\nnatural to think, that command will be given, for a greater load to be\r\nput upon it?\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[21] This was a project for the establishment of a national bank for\r\nIreland. Swift ridiculed the proposal (see p. 31), no doubt, out of\r\nsuspicion of the acts of stock-jobbers and the monied interests which\r\nwere enlisted on the side of the Whigs. His experience, also, of the\r\nabortive South Sea Schemes would tend to make his opposition all the\r\nstronger. But the plans for the bank were not ill-conceived, and had\r\nSwift been in calmer temper he might have seen the advantages which\r\nattached to the proposals. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[22] Thus in original edition. In Faulkner and the \"Miscellanies\" of\r\n1735 the words are, \"altogether imaginary.\" [T.

[F.]\r\n\r\n[25] Paul Lorrain, who was appointed ordinary of Newgate in 1698,\r\ncompiled numerous confessions and dying speeches of prisoners condemned\r\nto be hanged. A letter to Swift, from Pope and Bolingbroke, dated\r\nDecember, 1725, mentions him as \"the great historiographer,\" and Steele,\r\nin the \"Tatler\" and \"Spectator,\" refers to \"Lorrain's Saints.\" Lorrain\r\nattended some famous criminals to the scaffold, including Captain Kidd\r\nand Jack Sheppard. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[26] The following is an account of the proceedings of both the houses\r\nof the Irish parliament upon the subject of this proposed bank.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1720, James, Earl of Abercorn, Gustavus, Viscount Boyne, Sir\r\nRalph Gore, Bart., Oliver St. George, and Michael Ward, Esqs., in behalf\r\nof themselves and others, presented a petition to his Majesty for a\r\ncharter of incorporation, whereby they might be established as a bank,\r\nunder the name and title of the Bank of Ireland. They proposed to raise\r\na fund of £500,000 to supply merchants, etc., with money at five per\r\ncent., and agreed to contribute £50,000 to the service of government in\r\nconsideration of their obtaining a charter. In their petition they\r\nstate, that \"the raising of a million for that purpose is creating a\r\ngreater fund than the nation can employ.\" Soon after the above-mentioned\r\npetition was lodged, a second application was made by Lord Forbes and\r\nothers, who proposed raising a million for that purpose, and offered to\r\ndischarge \"the £50,000 national debt of that kingdom, in five years from\r\nthe time they should obtain a charter.\" The latter application, being\r\nsubsequent in point of date, was withdrawn, Lord Forbes and his friends\r\nhaving acquainted the Lord-lieutenant that, \"rather than, by a\r\ncompetition, obstruct a proposal of so general advantage, they were\r\nwilling to desist from their application.\" The former was accordingly\r\napproved of, and the King, on the 29th of July, 1721, issued letters of\r\nPrivy Seal, directing that a charter of incorporation should pass the\r\nGreat Seal of Ireland. (\"Comm. Journ.,\" vol. iii, Appendix ix, page cc,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\nWhen the parliament of Ireland met, on the 12th of September following,\r\nthe Duke of Grafton, lord lieutenant, in his speech from the throne,\r\ncommunicated the intention of his Majesty to both houses, and concluded\r\nby saying, \"As this is a matter of general and national concern, his\r\nMajesty leaves it to the wisdom of Parliament to consider what\r\nadvantages the public may receive by erecting a bank, and in what manner\r\nit may be settled upon a safe foundation, so as to be beneficial to the\r\nkingdom.\" The commons, in their address, which was voted unanimously on\r\nthe 14th, expressed their gratitude for his Majesty's goodness and royal\r\nfavour in directing a commission to establish a bank, and on the 21st\r\nmoved for the papers to be laid before them; they even, on the 29th,\r\nagreed to the following resolution of the committee they had appointed,\r\n\"that the establishment of a bank upon a solid and good foundation,\r\nunder proper regulations and restrictions, will contribute to restoring\r\nof credit, and support of the trade and manufacture of the kingdom;\"\r\nbut, when the heads of a bill for establishing the bank came to be\r\ndiscussed, a strenuous opposition was raised to it. On the 9th of\r\nDecember Sir Thomas Taylor, chairman of the committee to whom the matter\r\nhad been referred, reported \"that they had gone through the first\r\nenacting paragraph, and disagreed to the same.\" Accordingly, the\r\nquestion being proposed and put, the house (after a division, wherein\r\nthere appeared 150 for the question and 80 against it) voted that \"they\r\ncould not find any safe foundation for establishing a public bank,\" and\r\nresolved that an address, conformable to this resolution, should be\r\npresented to the lord-lieutenant. (Comm. Journ., vol. iii, pp.\r\n247-289.)\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the House of Lords resembled that of the Commons; on\r\nthe 8th of November they concurred with the resolution of their\r\ncommittee, which was unfavourable to the establishment of a bank. A\r\nprotest was, however, entered, signed by four temporal and two spiritual\r\npeers, and when an address to his Majesty, grounded on that resolution,\r\nwas proposed, a long debate ensued, which occupied two days. On the 9th\r\nDecember a list of the subscriptions was called for, and on the 16th\r\nthey resolved, that if any lord, spiritual or temporal, should attempt\r\nto obtain a charter to erect a bank, \"he should be deemed a contemnor of\r\nthe authority of that house, and a betrayer of the liberty of his\r\ncountry.\" They ordered, likewise, that this resolution should be\r\npresented by the chancellor to the lord lieutenant. (\"Lord's Journal,\"\r\nvol. ii, pp. 687-720.) _Monck Mason's \"Hist. St. Patrick's Cathedral_,\"\r\np. 325, note 3. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[27] The title, Esquire, according to a high authority, was anciently\r\napplied \"to the younger sons of nobility and their heirs in the\r\nimmediate line, to the eldest sons of knights and their heirs, to the\r\nesquire of the knights and others of that rank in his Majesty's service,\r\nand to such as had eminent employment in the Commonwealth, and were not\r\nknighted, such as judges, sheriffs, and justices of the peace during\r\ntheir offices, and some others. But now,\" says Sir Edward Walker, \"in\r\nthe days of Charles I., the addition is so increased, that he is a very\r\npoor and inconsiderable person who writes himself less.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, most of the signatures for shares in the projected National\r\nBank of Ireland, were dignified with the addition of Esquire, which,\r\nadded to the obscurity of the subscribers, incurs the ridicule of our\r\nauthor in the following treatise.

In the 2,295 parishes, there was in each an\r\naverage of at least ten beggars carrying on their trade the whole year\r\nround; the total number of these wandering paupers he puts down at over\r\n34,000. Computing 30,000 of them able to work, and assuming that each\r\nbeggar could earn _4d._ a day in a working year of 284 days, he\r\ncalculates that their idleness is a loss to the nation of £142,000.

The land of Ireland being largely pasture land\r\nand England being the chief and nearest market, these laws practically\r\ndestroyed the farming industry. The pernicious acts were passed on\r\ncomplaint from English land proprietors that the competition from Irish\r\ncattle had lowered their rents in England. \"In this manner,\" says Lecky,\r\n\"the chief source of Irish prosperity was annihilated at a single blow.\"\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[50] The original Navigation Act treated Ireland on an equal footing\r\nwith England. The act, however, was succeeded in 1663 by that of 15\r\nCharles II c. 7, in which it was declared that no European articles,\r\nwith few exceptions, could be imported into the colonies unless they had\r\nbeen loaded in English-built vessels at English ports. Nor could goods\r\nbe brought from English colonies except to English ports. By the Acts 22\r\nand 23 of Charles II. c. 26 the exclusion of Ireland was confirmed, and\r\nthe Acts 7 and 8 of Will. III. c. 22, passed in 1696, actually\r\nprohibited any goods whatever from being imported to Ireland direct from\r\nthe English colonies. These are the reasons for Swift's remark that\r\nIreland's ports were of no more use to Ireland's people \"than a\r\nbeautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[51] See note on page 137 of vol. vi of this edition. \"The Drapier's\r\nLetters.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[52] Lecky quotes from the MSS. in the British Museum, from a series of\r\nletters written by Bishop Nicholson, on his journey to Derry, to the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. The quotation illustrates the truth of Swift's\r\nremark. \"Never did I behold,\" writes Nicholson, \"even in Picardy,\r\nWestphalia, or Scotland, such dismal marks of hunger and want as\r\nappeared in the countenances of the poor creatures I met with on the\r\nroad.\" In the \"Intelligencer\" (No. VI, 1728) Sheridan wrote: \"The poor\r\nare sunk to the lowest degrees of misery and poverty--their houses\r\ndunghills, their victuals the blood of their cattle, or the herbs of the\r\nfield.\" Of the condition of the country thirty years later, the most\r\nterrible of pictures is given by Burdy in his \"Life of Skelton\": \"In\r\n1757 a remarkable dearth prevailed in Ireland.... Mr. Skelton went out\r\ninto the country to discover the real state of his poor, and travelled\r\nfrom cottage to cottage, over mountains, rocks, and heath.... In one\r\ncabin he found the people eating boiled prushia [a weed with a yellow\r\nflower that grows in cornfields] by itself for their breakfast, and\r\ntasted this sorry food, which seemed nauseous to him. Next morning he\r\ngave orders to have prushia gathered and boiled for his own breakfast,\r\nthat he might live on the same sort of food with the poor. He ate this\r\nfor one or two days; but at last his stomach turning against it, he set\r\noff immediately for Ballyshannon to buy oatmeal for them.... One day,\r\nwhen he was travelling in this manner through the country, he came to a\r\nlonely cottage in the mountains, where he found a poor woman lying in\r\nchild-bed with a number of children about her. All she had, in her weak,\r\nhelpless condition to keep herself and her children alive, was blood and\r\nsorrel boiled up together. The blood, her husband, who was a herdsman,\r\ntook from the cattle of others under his care, for he had none of his\r\nown. This was a usual sort of food in that country in times of scarcity,\r\nfor they bled the cows for that purpose, and thus the same cow often\r\nafforded both milk and blood.... They were obliged, when the carriers\r\nwere bringing the meal to Pettigo, to guard it with their clubs, as the\r\npeople of the adjacent parishes strove to take it by force, in which\r\nthey sometimes succeeded, hunger making them desperate.\" (Burdy's Life\r\nof Skelton. \"Works,\" vol. i, pp. lxxx-lxxxii.)

The melancholy sight of\r\nthe denuded land drew the attention of a Parliamentary Commission\r\nappointed to inquire into the matter. The Act of 10 Will. III. 2, c. 12\r\nordered the planting of a certain number of trees in every county,\r\n\"but,\" remarks Lecky, \"it was insufficient to counteract the destruction\r\nwhich was due to the cupidity or the fears of the new proprietors.\"\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[99] Swift always distinguished between the Irish \"barbarians\" and the\r\nIrish who were in reality English settlers in Ireland. Swift, for once,\r\nis in accord with the desires of the English Government, who wished to\r\neradicate the Irish language. His friend the Archbishop of Dublin and\r\nhis own college, that of Trinity, were in favour of keeping the language\r\nalive. (See Lecky's \"Ireland,\" vol. i., pp. 331-332.) [T.

S.]\r\n\r\n[102] The text here given is that of Scott read by the \"Miscellaneous\r\nPieces\" of 1789. The \"Observations\" were written, probably, in 1729.\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[103] Monck Mason has an elaborate note on this subject (\"Hist. of St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral,\" pp. 320-321, ed. 1819), which is well worth\r\nreprinting here, since it is an excellent statement of facts, and is\r\nfully borne out by Hely Hutchinson's account in his \"Commercial\r\nRestraints of Ireland,\" to which reference has already been made:\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1698 a bill was introduced into the English Parliament,\r\ngrounded upon complaints, that the woollen manufacture in Ireland\r\nprejudiced the staple trade of England; the matter terminated at last in\r\nan address to the King, wherein the commons 'implored his majesty's\r\nprotection and favour on this matter, and that he would make it his\r\nroyal care, and enjoin all those whom he employed in Ireland, to use\r\ntheir utmost diligence, to hinder the exportation of wool from Ireland\r\n(except it be imported into England), and for the discouraging the\r\nwoollen manufacture, and increasing the linen manufacture of Ireland.'\r\nAccordingly, on the 16th July, the King wrote a letter of instructions\r\nto the Earl of Galway, in which the following passage appears: 'The\r\nchief thing that must be tried to be prevented, is, that the Irish\r\nparliament takes no notice of what has passed in this here, and that you\r\nmake effectual laws for the linen manufacture, and discourage as far as\r\npossible the woollen.'--The Earl of Galway and the other justices\r\nconvened the parliament on the 27th of September; in their speech, they\r\nrecommended a bill for the encouragement of the manufactures of linen\r\nand hemp, 'which,' say they, 'will be found more advantageous to this\r\nkingdom than the woollen manufacture, which, being the settled trade of\r\nEngland from whence all foreign markets are supplied, can never be\r\nencouraged here.' The house of commons so far concurred with the lords\r\njustices' sentiments as to say, in their address of thanks, that they\r\nwould heartily endeavour to establish the linen manufacture, and to\r\nrender the same useful to England, and 'we hope,' they add, 'to find\r\nsuch a temperament, with respect to the woollen trade here, that the\r\nsame may not be injurious to England' ('Cont. Rapin's Hist.,' p. 376).\r\n'And they did,' says Mr. Smith, 'so far come into a temperament in this\r\ncase, as, hoping it would be accepted by way of compromise, to lay a\r\nhigh duty of ... upon all their woollen manufacture exported; under\r\nwhich, had England acquiesced, I am persuaded it would have been better\r\nfor the kingdom in general. But the false notion of a possible monopoly,\r\nmade the English deaf to all other terms of accommodation; by which\r\nmeans they lost the horse rather than quit the stable' ('Memoirs of\r\nWool,' vol. ii., p. 30). The duties imposed by the Irish parliament, at\r\nthis time, upon the export of manufactured wool, was four shillings on\r\nthe value of twenty shillings of the old drapery, and two shillings upon\r\nthe like value of the new, except friezes. But this concurrence of the\r\npeople of Ireland seemed rather to heighten the jealousy between the two\r\nnations, by making the people of England imagine the manufactures of\r\nIreland were arrived at a dangerous pitch of improvement, since they\r\ncould be supposed capable of bearing so extravagant a duty: accordingly,\r\nin the next following year, the English parliament passed an Act (10-11\r\nWilliam III: cap. 10), that no person should export from Ireland wool or\r\nwoollen goods, except to England or Wales, under high penalties, such\r\ngoods to be shipped only from certain ports in Ireland, and to certain\r\nports in England: But this was not the whole grievance; the old duties\r\nupon the import of those commodities, whether raw or manufactured, into\r\nGreat Britain, were left in the same state as before, which amounted\r\nnearly to a prohibition; thus did the English, although they had not\r\nthemselves any occasion for those commodities, prohibit, nevertheless,\r\ntheir being sent to any other nation.\r\n\r\n\"The discouragement of the woollen manufacture of Ireland, affected\r\nparticularly the English settlers there, for the linen was entirely in\r\nthe hands of the Scotch, who were established in Ulster, and the Irish\r\nnatives had no share in either. It is stated in a pamphlet, entitled, 'A\r\nDiscourse concerning Ireland, etc. in answer to the Exon and Barnstaple\r\npetitions,' printed 1697-8, that there were then, in the city and\r\nsuburbs of Dublin, 12,000 English families, and throughout the nation,\r\n50,000, who were bred to trades connected with the manufacture of wool,\r\n'who could no more get their bread in the linen manufacture, than a\r\nLondon taylor by shoe-making.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Walter Scott says ('Life of Swift,' p. 278) that the Irish woollen\r\nmanufacture produced an annual million, but this is not the fact; Mr.\r\nDobbs in his 'Essay on the Trade of Ireland,' informs us, from the\r\ncustom-house books, that in the year 1697 (which immediately preceded\r\nthe year in which the address above-mentioned was transmitted to the\r\nking) the total value of Irish woollen exports, of all sorts, was only\r\n_£23,614 9s. 6d._, and in 1687, when they were at the highest, they\r\ndid not exceed _£70,521 14s. 0d._ It moreover appears, that the\r\ngreater part of these exports were of a sort which did not interfere\r\nwith the trade of England, _£56,415 16s. 0d._ was in friezes, and\r\n_£2,520 18s. 0d._ coarse stockings, the rest consisted in serges and\r\nother stuffs of the new drapery, which affected not the trade of England\r\ngenerally, but only the particular interests of Exeter and its\r\nneighbourhood, and a very few other inconsiderable towns.\r\n\r\n\"But, whatever injury was intended, little prejudice was done to\r\nIreland, except what followed immediately after the passing of this Act.\r\nIt appears from Mr. Dobbs's pamphlet, that, a few years after, four\r\ntimes the quantity of woollen goods were shipped in each year,\r\nclandestinely, than had ever been exported, legally, before: moreover,\r\nthe Irish vastly increased their manufactures for home consumption, and\r\nlearned to make fine cloth from Spanish wool: it was only to England\r\nitself that any disadvantage redounded; many manufacturers who were\r\nunsettled by this measure, passed over to Germany, Spain, and to Rouen\r\nand other parts of France, 'from these beginnings they have, in many\r\nbranches, so much improved the woollen manufactures of France, as to vie\r\nwith the English in foreign markets.--Upon the whole, those nations may\r\nbe justly said to have deprived Britain of millions since that time,\r\ninstead of the thousands Ireland might possibly have made.'--What Mr.\r\nDobbs has here asserted, relative to the removal of the manufacturers,\r\nhas been confirmed by another tract, 'Letter from a Clothier a Member of\r\nParliament,' printed in 1731, which informs us that, for some years\r\nafter, the English seemed to engross all the woollen trade, 'but this\r\nappearance of benefit abated, as the foreign factories, raised on the\r\nruin of the Irish, acquired strength': he shows too, that the\r\nimportation of unmanufactured wool from Ireland to England had been\r\ngradually decreasing since that time, which was probably on account of\r\nthe increase of the illicit trade to foreign parts, towards the\r\nencouragement of which the duties, or legal transportation, served to\r\nact as a bounty of 36 per cent. 'So true it is, that England can never\r\nfall into measures for unreasonably cramping the industry of the people\r\nof Ireland, without doing herself the greatest prejudice.'\" (Note g, pp.\r\n320-321). [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[104] The causes for absenteeism are thus noted by Lecky (\"Hist. of\r\nIreland,\" p. 213, vol. i., ed. 1892): \"The very large part of the\r\nconfiscated land was given to Englishmen who had property and duties in\r\nEngland, and habitually lived there. Much of it also came into the\r\nmarket, and as there was very little capital in Ireland, and as\r\nCatholics were forbidden to purchase land, this also passed largely into\r\nthe hands of English speculators. Besides, the level of civilization was\r\nmuch higher in England than in Ireland. The position of a Protestant\r\nlandlord, living in the midst of a degraded population, differing from\r\nhim in religion and race, had but little attraction, the political\r\nsituation of the country closed to an Irish gentleman nearly every\r\navenue of honourable ambition, and owing to a long series of very\r\nevident causes, the sentiment of public duty was deplorably low. The\r\neconomical condition was not checked by any considerable movement in the\r\nopposite direction, for after the suppression of the Irish manufactures\r\nbut few Englishmen, except those who obtained Irish offices, came to\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of the rent obtained in Ireland that was spent in England is\r\nestimated elsewhere by Swift to have been at least one-third. In 1729,\r\nPrior assessed the amount at £627,000. In the Supplement to his \"List of\r\nAbsentees,\" Prior gives eight further \"articles\" by which money was\r\n\"yearly drawn out of the Kingdom.\" See the \"Supplement,\" pp. 242-245 in\r\nThone's \"Collection of Tracts,\" Dublin, 1861. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[105] John Erskine, Earl of Mar, has elsewhere been characterized by\r\nSwift as \"crooked; he seemed to me to be a gentleman of good sense and\r\ngood nature.\" The great rebellion of 1715, for which Mar was\r\nresponsible, was stirred up by him in favour of the Pretender, and\r\nsucceeded so far as to bring the Chevalier to Scotland. The Duke of\r\nArgyll, however, fought his forces, and though the victory remained\r\nundecided, Mar was compelled to seek safety in France. The rebellion\r\ncaused so much disturbance in every part of the British Isles that\r\nIreland suffered greatly from bad trade. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[106] Joshua, Lord Allen. See note on p. 175. [T.

S.]\r\n\r\n[112] The person here intimated, Joshua, Lord Allen (whom Swift\r\nelsewhere satirizes under the name of Traulus), was born in 1685. He is\r\nsaid to have been a weak and dissipated man; and some particulars are\r\nrecorded by tradition concerning his marriage with Miss Du Pass (whose\r\nfather was clerk of the secretary of state's office in James the\r\nSecond's reign, and died in India in 1699), which do very little honour\r\neither to his heart or understanding.\r\n\r\nIt is reported, that being trepanned into a marriage with this lady, by\r\na stratagem of the celebrated Lionel, Duke of Dorset, Lord Allen\r\nrefused, for some time, to acknowledge her as his wife. But the lady,\r\nafter living some time in close retirement, caused an advertisement to\r\nbe inserted in the papers, stating the death of a brother in the East\r\nIndies, by which Miss Margaret Du Pass had succeeded to a large fortune.\r\nAccordingly, she put on mourning, and assumed an equipage conforming to\r\nher supposed change of fortune. Lord Allen's affairs being much\r\nderanged, he became now as anxious to prove the marriage with the\r\nwealthy heiress, as he had formerly been to disown the unportioned\r\ndamsel; and succeeded, after such opposition as the lady judged\r\nnecessary to give colour to the farce. Before the deceit was discovered,\r\nLady Allen, by her good sense and talents, had obtained such ascendance\r\nover her husband, that they ever afterwards lived in great harmony.\r\n\r\nLord Allen was, at the time of giving offence to Swift, a\r\nprivy-counsellor; and distinguished himself, according to Lodge, in the\r\nHouse of Peers, by his excellent speeches for the benefit of his\r\ncountry. He died at Stillorgan, 1742. [S.]\r\n\r\nSwift did not allow Lord Allen to rest with this \"advertisement.\" In the\r\npoem entitled \"Traulus,\" Allen is gibbetted in some lively rhymes. He\r\ncalls him a \"motley fruit of mongrel seed,\" and traces his descent from\r\nthe mother's side (she was the sister of the Earl of Kildare) as well as\r\nthe father's (who was the son of Sir Joshua Allen, Lord Mayor of Dublin\r\nin 1673):\r\n\r\n  \"Who could give the looby such airs?\r\n  Were they masons, were they butchers?\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  This was dexterous at the trowel,\r\n  That was bred to kill a cow well:\r\n  Hence the greasy clumsy mien\r\n  In his dress and figure seen;\r\n  Hence the mean and sordid soul,\r\n  Like his body rank and foul;\r\n  Hence that wild suspicious peep,\r\n  Like a rogue that steals a sheep;\r\n  Hence he learnt the butcher's guile,\r\n  How to cut your throat and smile;\r\n  Like a butcher doomed for life\r\n  In his mouth to wear a knife;\r\n  Hence he draws his daily food\r\n  From his tenants' vital blood.\"\r\n\r\n[T.

The greater part of his career\r\nas a printer was spent in trials and imprisonments for the \"libels\"\r\nwhich appeared in his journal. This was largely due to the fact that his\r\nweekly newspaper became the recognized organ of Jacobites and\r\n\"High-fliers.\" From 1716 to 1728 he was a pretty busy man with the\r\ngovernment, and finally was compelled to go to France to escape from\r\nprosecution. In France he joined Wharton, but his \"Journal\" still\r\ncontinued to be issued until September 21st of the year 1728, which was\r\nthe date of the last issue. On the 28th of the same month, however,\r\nappeared its continuation under the title, \"Fog's Weekly Journal,\" and\r\nthis was carried on by Mist's friends. Mist died in 1737. [T.

[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[130] Sir W. Petty gives the population of Ireland as about one million,\r\ntwo hundred thousand (\"Pol. Arithmetic,\" 1699). [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[131] This is probably a Swiftian plausibility to give an air of truth\r\nto his remarks. Certain parts of America were at that time reputed to be\r\ninhabited by cannibals. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[132] This anecdote is taken from the Description of the Island of\r\nFormosa by that very extraordinary impostor George Psalmanazar, who for\r\nsome time passed himself for a native of that distant country. He\r\nafterwards published a retractation of his figments, with many\r\nexpressions of contrition, but containing certain very natural\r\nindications of dislike to those who had detected him. The passage\r\nreferred to in the text is as follows: \"We also eat human flesh, which\r\nI am now convinced is a very barbarous custom, though we feed only upon\r\nour open enemies, slain or made captive in the field, or else upon\r\nmalefactors legally executed; the flesh of the latter is our greatest\r\ndainty, and is four times dearer than other rare and delicious meat. We\r\nbuy it of the executioner, for the bodies of all public capital\r\noffenders are his fees. As soon as the criminal is dead, he cuts the\r\nbody in pieces, squeezes out the blood, and makes his house a shambles\r\nfor the flesh of men and women, where all people that can afford it come\r\nand buy. I remember, about ten years ago, a tall, well-complexioned,\r\npretty fat virgin, about nineteen years of age, and tire-woman to the\r\nqueen, was found guilty of high treason, for designing to poison the\r\nking; and accordingly she was condemned to suffer the most cruel death\r\nthat could be invented, and her sentence was, to be nailed to a cross,\r\nand kept alive as long as possible. The sentence was put in execution;\r\nwhen she fainted with the cruel torment, the hangman gave her strong\r\nliquors, &c. to revive her; the sixth day she died. Her long sufferings,\r\nyouth, and good constitution, made her flesh so tender, delicious, and\r\nvaluable, that the executioner sold it for above eight tallies; for\r\nthere was such thronging to this inhuman market, that men of great\r\nfashion thought themselves fortunate if they could purchase a pound or\r\ntwo of it.\" Lond. 1705, p. 112. [S.]\r\n\r\n[133] The English government had been making concessions to the\r\nDissenters, and, of course, Swift satirically alludes here to the\r\narguments used by the government in the steps they had taken. But the\r\ntruth of the matter, Swift hints, was, that those who desired to abolish\r\nthe test were more anxious for their pockets than their consciences.\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[134] The inhabitants of a district of Brazil supposed to be savages,\r\nmaking the name synonymous with savage ignorance. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[135]\r\n\r\n  \"Remove me from this land of slaves,\r\n  Where all are fools, and all are knaves,\r\n  Where every fool and knave is bought,\r\n  Yet kindly sells himself for nought.\"\r\n\r\n(_From Swift's note-book, written while detained at Holyhead in\r\nSeptember, 1727._) [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[136] All these are proposals advocated, of course, by Swift himself, in\r\nprevious pamphlets and papers. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[137] So that there would be no danger of an objection from England that\r\nthe English were suffering from Irish competition. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[138] This was the celebrated periodical founded by Pulteney, after he\r\nhad separated himself from Walpole, to which Bolingbroke contributed his\r\nfamous letters of an Occasional Writer. The journal carried on a\r\npolitical war against Walpole's administration, and endeavoured to bring\r\nabout the establishment of a new party, to consist of Tories and the\r\nWhigs who could not agree with Walpole's methods. Caleb D'Anvers was a\r\nmere name for a Grub Street hack who was supposed to be the writer. But\r\nWalpole had no difficulty in recognizing the hand of Bolingbroke, and\r\nhis reply to the first number of the Occasional Writer made Bolingbroke\r\nwince. [T.

S.]\r\n\r\n[141] The chief source of income in Ireland came from the pasture lands\r\non which cattle were bred. The cattle were imported to England. The\r\nEnglish landlords, however, taking alarm, discovered to the Crown that\r\nthis importation of Irish cattle was lowering English rents. Two Acts\r\npassed in 1665 and 1680 fully met the wishes of the landlords, and\r\nruined absolutely the Irish cattle trade. Prevented thus from breeding\r\ncattle, the Irish turned to the breeding of sheep, and established, in a\r\nvery short time, an excellent trade in wool. How England ruined this\r\nindustry also may be seen from note on p. 158. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[142] Alluding to the facilities afforded for the recruiting of the\r\nFrench army in Ireland. [T.

S.]\r\n\r\n[145] At Christ Church. See note prefixed to this tract. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[146] Sheridan, in his life of Swift, gives an instance of this which is\r\nquoted by Scott. Carteret had appointed Sheridan one of his domestic\r\nchaplains, and the two would often spend hours together, or, in company\r\nwith Swift, exchanging talk and knowledge. When Sheridan had one of the\r\nGreek tragedies performed by the scholars of the school he kept,\r\nCarteret wished to read the play over with him before the performance.\r\nAt this reading Sheridan was surprised at the ease with which his patron\r\ncould translate the original, and, asking him how he came to know it so\r\nwell, Carteret told him \"that when he was envoy in Denmark, he had been\r\nfor a long time confined to his chamber, partly by illness, and partly\r\nby the severity of the weather; and having but few books with him, he\r\nhad read Sophocles over and over so often as to be almost able to repeat\r\nthe whole _verbatim_, which impressed it ever after indelibly on his\r\nmemory.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[147] This refers to Richard Tighe, the gentleman who informed on poor\r\nSheridan for preaching from the text on the anniversary of King George's\r\naccession, \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" It was on this\r\ninformation that Sheridan lost his living. Swift never afterwards missed\r\nan opportunity to ridicule Tighe, and he has lampooned that individual\r\nin several poems. In \"The Legion Club\" Swift calls him Dick Fitzbaker,\r\nalluding to his descent from one of Cromwell's contractors, who supplied\r\nthe army with bread. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[148] \"The worst of times\" was the expression used by the Whigs when\r\nthey referred to Oxford's administration in the last four years of Queen\r\nAnne's reign. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[149] A famous rope-dancer of that time. [H.]\r\n\r\n[150] A justice of the peace, who afterwards gave Swift farther\r\nprovocation. It was Hutcheson who signed Faulkner's committal to prison\r\nfor printing \"A New Proposal for the Better Regulation and Improvement\r\nof Quadrille,\" a pamphlet which Swift did not write, but which had his\r\nfavour. A jeering insinuation was made against the famous Sergeant\r\nBettesworth, whom Swift had already lampooned, and Bettesworth\r\ncomplained to the House of Commons. Hutcheson aided Bettesworth in this\r\nprosecution, causing Swift to be roused to a strong indignation against\r\nsuch unconstitutional proceedings.\r\n\r\n  \"Better we all were in our graves,\r\n  Than live in slavery to slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the lines beginning one of his more trenchant lampoons against\r\nthe magistrate. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[151] \"The beast who had kicked him\" is the expression Swift uses for\r\nTighe in writing to Sheridan in a letter on September 25th, 1725. In\r\nthat letter Swift urges Sheridan to revenge, and promises him his help.\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[152] The word is spelt \"Galloway\" in the original edition. The earldom\r\nof Galway became extinct in 1720. For an account of the earl, see note\r\non p. 20 of volume v. of this edition. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[153] Joshua, Lord Allen. See p. 175 [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[154] Swift's poem entitled \"Traulus\" was published at this price, and\r\ngives in rhyme much the same matter as is here given in prose. See p.\r\n176. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[155] Lord Allen was reputed to be wrong in his head. When Swift was\r\nonce asked to excuse him for his conduct on the plea that he was mad,\r\nSwift replied: \"I know that he is a madman; and, if that were all, no\r\nman living could commiserate his condition more than myself; but, sir,\r\nhe is a madman possessed by the devil. I renounce him.\" (See Scott's\r\n\"Life of Swift,\" p. 365.) [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[156] The reader may compare what is stated in these two paragraphs with\r\nthe same opinion expressed by the author in \"The Public Spirit of the\r\nWhigs.\" [S.]\r\n\r\n[157] See notes on pp. 74, 232. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[158] See note on p. 232. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[159] Mr. Tickell and Mr. Ballaquer. Tickell was Addison's biographer,\r\nand a friend and correspondent of Swift. He was no mean poet, and though\r\nPope did not care for him Swift did. Tickell was Secretary to the Lords\r\nJustices of Ireland, and Ballaquer Secretary to Carteret. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[160] The day of the anniversary of the accession of George I. In his\r\n\"History of Solomon the Second\" Swift censures his friend strongly for\r\nhis indiscretion. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[161] The Richard Tighe afore-mentioned. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[162] Sheridan wrote a poem displeasing to Swift, which Swift thus\r\nanimadverts on in the \"History of the Second Solomon\": \"Having lain many\r\nyears under the obloquy of a high Tory and a Jacobite, upon the present\r\nQueen's birthday, he [Dr. Sheridan] writ a song to be performed before\r\nthe government and those who attended them, in praise of the Queen and\r\nKing, on the common topics of her beauty, wit, family, love of England,\r\nand all other virtues, wherein the King and the royal children were\r\nsharers. It was very hard to avoid the common topics. A young collegian\r\nwho had done the same job the year before, got some reputation on\r\naccount of his wit. Solomon would needs vie with him, by which he lost\r\nthe esteem of his old friends the Tories, and got not the least interest\r\nwith the Whigs, for they are now too strong to want advocates of that\r\nkind; and, therefore, one of the lords-justices reading the verses in\r\nsome company, said, 'Ah, doctor, this shall not do.' His name was at\r\nlength in the title-page; and he did this without the knowledge or\r\nadvice of one living soul, as he himself confesseth.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[163] Dr. Stopford, Bishop of Cloyne, one of Swift's intimate friends.\r\nStopford always acknowledged that he owed his advancement entirely to\r\nSwift's kindness. He wrote an elegant Latin tribute to Swift, given by\r\nScott in an appendix to the \"Life.\" With Delany and others he was one of\r\nSwift's executors.\r\n\r\n[164] Delany was a ripe scholar and much esteemed by Swift, though the\r\nlatter had occasion to rebuke him for attempting to court favour with\r\nthe Castle people, and for an attack on the \"Intelligencer,\" a journal\r\nwhich Swift and Sheridan had started. Delany, however, was a little\r\njealous of Sheridan's favour with the Dean. He was afterwards Chancellor\r\nof St Patrick's, and wrote a life of Swift. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[165] Sir Constantine Phipps, Lord Chancellor of Ireland when Queen Anne\r\ndied. [_Orig. Note._]\r\n\r\n[166] Swift himself. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[167] Dr. William King, who died a year or so before Swift wrote. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[168] In 1724, two under-graduates were expelled from Trinity College\r\nfor alleged insolence to the provost. Dr. Delany espoused their cause\r\nwith such warmth that it drew upon him very inconvenient consequences,\r\nand he was at length obliged to give satisfaction to the college by a\r\nformal acknowledgment of his offence. [S.]\r\n\r\n[169] A very good friend of Swift, at whose place at Gosford, in the\r\ncounty of Antrim, Swift would often stay for months together. The\r\nreference here is to the project for converting a large house, called\r\nHamilton's Bawn, situated about two miles from Sir Arthur Acheson's\r\nseat, into a barrack. The project gave rise to Swift's poem, entitled,\r\n\"The Grand Question Debated,\" given by Scott in vol. xv., p. 171. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[170] Most of these expressions explain themselves. \"Termagants\" was\r\napplied to resisters, as used in the old morality plays. \"Iconoclasts,\"\r\nthe name given to those who defaced King William's statue.\r\n\"White-rosalists,\" given to those who wore the Stuart badge on the 10th\r\nof June, the day of the Pretender's birthday.

(a gentleman of great worth and honour, and very knowing\r\nin his profession) was elected [F.]\r\n\r\n[189] Dr. William King. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[190] The following, from Deane Swift's edition, given by Sir Walter\r\nScott in his edition of Swift's works, refers to this \"very plain\r\nproposal.\" It is evidently written by Swift, and is dated, as from the\r\nDeanery House, September 26th, 1726, almost eleven years before the\r\nabove tract was issued:\r\n\r\n\"DEANERY-HOUSE, _Sept. 26, 1726._\r\n\r\n\"The continued concourse of beggars from all parts of the kingdom to\r\nthis city, having made it impossible for the several parishes to\r\nmaintain their own poor, according to the ancient laws of the land,\r\nseveral lord mayors did apply themselves to the lord Archbishop of\r\nDublin, that his grace would direct his clergy, and his churchwardens of\r\nthe said city, to appoint badges of brass, copper, or pewter, to be worn\r\nby the poor of the several parishes. The badges to be marked with the\r\ninitial letters of the name of each church, and numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.,\r\nand to be well sewed and fastened on the right and left shoulder of the\r\noutward garment of each of the said poor, by which they might be\r\ndistinguished. And that none of the said poor should go out of their own\r\nparish to beg alms; whereof the beadles were to take care.\r\n\r\n\"His grace the lord Archbishop, did accordingly give his directions to\r\nthe clergy; which, however, have proved wholly ineffectual, by the\r\nfraud, perverseness, or pride of the said poor, several of them openly\r\nprotesting 'they will never submit to wear the said badges.' And of\r\nthose who received them, almost every one keep them in their pockets, or\r\nhang them in a string about their necks, or fasten them under their\r\ncoats, not to be seen, by which means the whole design is eluded; so\r\nthat a man may walk from one end of the town to another, without seeing\r\none beggar regularly badged, and in such great numbers, that they are a\r\nmighty nuisance to the public, most of them being foreigners.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore proposed, that his grace the lord Archbishop would\r\nplease to call the clergy of the city together, and renew his directions\r\nand exhortations to them, to put the affair of badges effectually in\r\npractice, by such methods as his grace and they shall agree upon. And I\r\nthink it would be highly necessary that some paper should be pasted up\r\nin several proper parts of the city, signifying this order, and\r\nexhorting all people to give no alms except to those poor who are\r\nregularly badged, and only while they are in the precincts of their own\r\nparishes. And if something like this were delivered by the ministers in\r\nthe reading-desk two or three Lord's-days successively, it would still\r\nbe of further use to put this matter upon a right foot. And that all who\r\noffend against this regulation shall be treated as vagabonds and sturdy\r\nbeggars.\" [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[191] Spelt now St. Warburgh's. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[192] About the beginning of the eighteenth century, Dr. Gwythers, a\r\nphysician, and fellow of the University of Dublin, brought over with him\r\na parcel of frogs from England to Ireland, in order to propagate their\r\nspecies in that kingdom, and threw them into the ditches of the\r\nUniversity Park; but they all perished. Whereupon he sent to England for\r\nsome bottles of the frog-spawn, which he threw into those ditches, by\r\nwhich means the species of frogs was propagated in that kingdom.\r\nHowever, their number was so small in the year 1720, that a frog was\r\nnowhere to be seen in Ireland, except in the neighbourhood of the\r\nUniversity Park: but within six or seven years after, they spread\r\nthirty, forty, or fifty miles over the country; and so at last, by\r\ndegrees, over the whole country. [D. S.]\r\n\r\n[193] Swift's uncle, Godwin Swift, for whose memory he had no special\r\nregard, seems to have been concerned in this ingenious anagram and\r\nunfortunate project. [S.]\r\n\r\n[194] This reproach has been certainly removed since the Dean\r\nflourished; for the titles of the Irish peerages of late creation have\r\nrather been in the opposite extreme, and resemble, in some instances,\r\nthe appellatives in romances and novels.\r\n\r\nThomas O'Brien MacMahon, an Irish author, quoted by Mr. Southey in his\r\nOmniana, in a most angry pamphlet on \"The Candour and Good-nature of\r\nEnglishmen,\" has the following diverting passage, which may serve as a\r\ncorollary to Swift's Tract:--\"You sent out the children of your\r\nprinces,\" says he, addressing the Irish, \"and sometimes your princes in\r\nperson, to enlighten this kingdom, then sitting in utter darkness,\r\n(meaning England) and how have they recompensed you? Why, after\r\nlawlessly distributing your estates, possessed for thirteen centuries or\r\nmore, by your illustrious families, whose antiquity and nobility, if\r\nequalled by any nation in the world, none but the immutable God of\r\nAbraham's chosen, though, at present, wandering and afflicted people,\r\nsurpasses: After, I say, seizing on your inheritances, and flinging them\r\namong their Cocks, Hens, Crows, Rooks, Daws, Wolves, Lions, Foxes, Rams,\r\nBulls, Hoggs, and other beasts and birds of prey, or vesting them in the\r\nsweepings of their jails, their Small-woods, Do-littles, Barebones,\r\nStrangeways, Smarts, Sharps, Tarts, Sterns, Churls, and Savages; their\r\nGreens, Blacks, Browns, Greys and Whites; their Smiths, Carpenters,\r\nBrewers, Bakers, and Taylors; their Sutlers, Cutlers, Butlers, Trustlers\r\nand Jugglers; their Norths, Souths, and Wests; their Fields, Rows,\r\nStreets, and Lanes; their Toms-sons, Dicks-sons, Johns-sons, James-sons,\r\nWills-sons, and Waters-sons; their Shorts, Longs, Lows, and Squabs;\r\ntheir Parks, Sacks, Tacks, and Jacks; and, to complete their ingratitude\r\nand injustice, they have transported a cargo of notorious traitors to\r\nthe Divine Majesty among you, impiously calling them the Ministers of\r\nGod's Word.\" [S.]\r\n\r\n[195] The Tholsel, where criminals for the city were tried, and where\r\nproclamations, etc., were posted. It was invariably called the Touls'el\r\nby the lower class. [S.]\r\n\r\n[196] This and the following piece were, according to Sir Walter Scott,\r\nfound among the collection of Mr. Smith. The examples of English\r\nblunders which Scott also reprints were given by Sheridan by way of\r\nretaliation to these specimens of Irish blunders noted by Swift. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[197] This specimen of Irish-English, or what Swift condemned as such,\r\nis taken from an unfinished copy in the Dean's handwriting, found among\r\nMr. Lyons's papers. [S.]\r\n\r\n[198] See note on p. 368. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[199] Dunkin was one of Swift's favourites, to judge by the efforts\r\nSwift made on his behalf. Writing to Alderman Barber (17th January,\r\n1737-38), Swift speaks of him as \"a gentleman of much wit and the best\r\nEnglish as well as Latin poet in this kingdom.\" Several of Dunkin's\r\npoems were printed in Scott's edition of Swift's works, but his\r\ncollected works were issued in 1774. Dunkin was educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[200] The \"Occasional Writer's\" Letters are printed in Lord\r\nBolingbroke's Works. [N.]\r\n\r\n[201] Sir Robert Walpole was by no means negligent of his literary\r\nassistants. But, unfortunately, like an unskilful general, he confided\r\nmore in the number than the spirit or discipline of his forces. Arnall,\r\nConcanen, and Henley, were wretched auxiliaries; yet they could not\r\ncomplain of indifferent pay, since Arnall used to brag, that, in the\r\ncourse of four years, he had received from the treasury, for his\r\npolitical writings, the sum of _£10,997 6s. 8d._ [S.]\r\n\r\n[202] The authority for considering this \"Account\" to be the work of\r\nSwift is Mr. Deane Swift, the editor of the edition of 1765 of Swift's\r\nworks. It is included in the eighth volume of the quarto edition issued\r\nthat year. Burke also seems to have had no doubt at all about the\r\nauthorship. Referring to the Dean's disposition to defend Queen Anne and\r\nto ridicule her successor, he says, \"it is probable that the pieces in\r\nwhich he does it ('Account of the Court of Japan,' and 'Directions for\r\nmaking a Birth-day Song') were the occasion of most of the other\r\nposthumous articles having been so long withheld from the publick.\"\r\nUndoubtedly, there is much in this piece that savours of Swift's method\r\nof dealing with such a subject; but that could easily be imitated by a\r\nclever reader of \"Gulliver.\" The style, however, in which it is written\r\nis not distinctly Swift's.\r\n\r\nAt the time this tract was written (1728) the Tory party was anxiously\r\nhoping that the accession of George II. would see the downfall of\r\nWalpole. But the party was doomed to a bitter disappointment. Walpole\r\nnot only maintained but added to the power he enjoyed under George I. By\r\nwhat means this was accomplished the writer of this piece attempts to\r\nhint. Sir Walter Scott thinks the piece was probably left imperfect,\r\n\"when the crisis to which the Tories so anxiously looked forward\r\nterminated so undesirably, in the confirmation of Walpole's power.\"\r\n[T. S.]\r\n\r\n[203] King George. [S.]\r\n\r\n[204] Queen Anne. [S.]\r\n\r\n[205] Whigs and Tories. Anagrams of Huigse and Toryes. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[206] Hanover. Anagrams for Deuts = Deutsch = German. [T. S.]\r\n\r\n[207] Bremen and Lubeck. [S.]\r\n\r\n[208] The quadruple alliance, usually accounted the most impolitic step\r\nin the reign of George I., had its rise in his anxiety for his\r\ncontinental dominions. [S.]\r\n\r\n[209] Through all the reign of George I., the Whigs were in triumphant\r\npossession of the government. [S.]\r\n\r\n[210] Sir Robert Walpole [S.]\r\n\r\n[211] When secretary at war, Walpole received £500 from the contractors\r\nfor forage; and although he alleged that it was a sum due to a third\r\nparty in the contract, and only remitted through his hands, he was voted\r\nguilty of corruption, expelled the House, and sent to the Tower, by the\r\nTory Parliament. [S.]\r\n\r\n[212] King George II. [S.]\r\n\r\n[213] Sir Spencer Compton, Speaker of the House of Commons. [S.]\r\n\r\n[214] Sir Thomas Hanmer. [S.]\r\n\r\n[215] About a million sterling. [D. S.]\r\n\r\n[216] This piece is included here on the authority of Mr. Deane Swift,\r\nand was accepted by Sir Walter Scott on the same authority. The writing\r\nis excellent and bears every mark of Swift's hand. In the note to the\r\n\"Letter to the Writer of the Occasional Paper\" was included the heads of\r\na paper which Swift suggested, found by Sir H. Craik. The present\r\n\"Answer\" may serve as further evidence of Sir H. Craik's suggestion that\r\nSwift may have assisted Pulteney and Bolingbroke on more than one\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe present text is that of the 1768 quarto edition. [T.
