Originally the shore of\r\nour northern lakes and streams were fringed with it and evergreen, and\r\nthe white charmingly contrasted with the green mirrored from the water\r\nwas indeed beautiful, but like the red man this tree is vanishing from\r\nour forests.\r\n\r\n    “Alas for us; our day is o’er\r\n    Our fires are out from shore to shore;\r\n    No more for us the wild deer bounds—\r\n    The plow is on our hunting grounds.\r\n    The pale man’s ax rings through our woods,\r\n    The pale man’s sail skims o’er floods;\r\n    Our pleasant springs are dry.\r\n    Our children—look by power oppressed,\r\n    Beyond the mountains of the west—\r\n    Our children go—to die.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHICAGO IN MY GRANDFATHER’S DAYS.—BY CHIEF POKAGON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED MAN’S REBUKE.\r\n\r\nBY SIMON POKAGON\r\n\r\n_Pottawattamie Chief._\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Shall not one line lament our forest race,\r\n    For you struck out from wild creation’s face?\r\n    Freedom—the selfsame freedom you adore,\r\n    Bade us defend our violated shore.”\r\n\r\nIn behalf of my people, the American Indians, I hereby declare to you,\r\nthe pale-faced race that has usurped our lands and homes, that we have no\r\nspirit to celebrate with you the Great Columbian Fair now being held in\r\nthis Chicago city, the wonder of the world.\r\n\r\nNo; sooner would we hold high joy-day over the graves of our departed\r\nfathers, than to celebrate our own funeral, the discovery of America. And\r\nwhile you who are strangers, and you who live here, bring the offerings\r\nof the handiwork of your own lands, and your hearts in admiration\r\nrejoice over the beauty and grandeur of this young republic, and you say,\r\n“Behold the wonders wrought by our children in this foreign land,” do not\r\nforget that this success has been at the sacrifice of _our_ homes and a\r\nonce happy race.\r\n\r\nWhere these great Columbian show-buildings stretch skyward, and where\r\nstands this “Queen City of the West,” _once_ stood the red man’s\r\nwigwam; here met their old men, young men, and maidens; here blazed\r\ntheir council-fires. But now the eagle’s eye can find no trace of them.\r\nHere was the center of their wide-spread hunting-grounds; stretching\r\nfar eastward, and to the great salt Gulf southward, and to the lofty\r\nRocky Mountain chain westward; and all about and beyond the Great Lakes\r\nnorthward roamed vast herds of buffalo that no man could number, while\r\nmoose, deer, and elk were found from ocean to ocean; pigeons, ducks, and\r\ngeese in near bow-shot moved in great clouds through the air, while fish\r\nswarmed our streams, lakes, and seas close to shore. All were provided\r\nby the Great Spirit for our use; we destroyed none except for food and\r\ndress; had plenty and were contented and happy.\r\n\r\nBut alas! the pale-faces came by chance to our shores, many times very\r\nneedy and hungry. We nursed and fed them,—fed the ravens that were soon\r\nto pluck out our eyes, and the eyes of our children; for no sooner had\r\nthe news reached the Old World that a new continent had been found,\r\npeopled with another race of men, than, locust-like, they swarmed on\r\nall our coasts; and, like the carrion crows in spring, that in circles\r\nwheel and clamor long and loud, and will not cease until they find and\r\nfeast upon the dead, so these strangers from the East long circuits made,\r\nand turkey-like they gobbled in our ears, “Give us gold, give us gold;”\r\n“Where find you gold? Where find you gold?”\r\n\r\nWe gave for promises and “gewgaws” all the gold we had, and showed them\r\nwhere to dig for more; to repay us, they robbed our homes of fathers,\r\nmothers, sons, and daughters; some were forced across the sea for slaves\r\nin Spain, while multitudes were dragged into the mines to dig for gold,\r\nand held in slavery there until all who escaped not, died under the lash\r\nof the cruel task-master. It finally passed into their history that, “the\r\nred man of the West, unlike the black man of the East, will die before\r\nhe’ll be a slave.” Our hearts were crushed by such base ingratitude; and,\r\nas the United States has now decreed, “No Chinaman shall land on our\r\nshores,” so we then felt that no such barbarians as they, should land on\r\n_ours_.\r\n\r\nIn those days that tried our fathers’ souls, tradition says: “A crippled,\r\ngrey-haired sire told his tribe that in the visions of the night he was\r\nlifted high above the earth, and in great wonder beheld a vast spider-web\r\nspread out over the land from the Atlantic Ocean toward the setting sun.\r\nIts net-work was made of rods of iron; along its lines in all directions\r\nrushed monstrous spiders, greater in strength, and larger far than any\r\nbeast of earth, clad in brass and iron, dragging after them long rows of\r\nwigwams with families therein, out-stripping in their course the flight\r\nof birds that fled before them. Hissing from their nostrils came forth\r\nfire and smoke, striking terror to both fowl and beast. The red men hid\r\nthemselves in fear, or fled away, while the white men trained these\r\nmonsters for the war path, as warriors for battle.”\r\n\r\nThe old man who saw the vision claimed it meant that the Indian race\r\nwould surely pass away before the pale-faced strangers. He died a martyr\r\nto his belief. Centuries have passed since that time, and we now behold\r\nin the vision as in a mirror, the present net-work of railroads, and the\r\nmonstrous engines with their fire, smoke, and hissing steam, with cars\r\nattached, as they go sweeping through the land.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone of civilization rolled westward; the forests of untold\r\ncenturies were swept away; streams dried up; lakes fell back from\r\ntheir ancient bounds; and all our fathers once loved to gaze upon was\r\ndestroyed, defaced, or marred, except the sun, moon, and starry skies\r\nabove, which the Great Spirit in his wisdom hung beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nStill on the storm-cloud rolled, while before its lightning and thunder\r\nthe beasts of the field and the fowls of the air withered like grass\r\nbefore the flame—were shot for love of power to kill alone, and left\r\nto spoil upon the plains. Their bleaching bones now scattered far and\r\nnear, in shame declare the wanton cruelty of pale-faced men. The storm\r\nunsatisfied on land swept our lakes and streams, while before its clouds\r\nof hooks, nets, and glistening spears the fish vanished from our waters\r\nlike the morning dew before the rising sun. Thus our inheritance was cut\r\noff, and we were driven and scattered as sheep before the wolves.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. They brought among us fatal diseases our fathers knew\r\nnot of; our medicine-men tried in vain to check the deadly plague; but\r\nthey themselves died, and our people fell as fall the leaves before the\r\nautumn’s blast. To be just, we must acknowledge there were some good\r\nmen with these strangers, who gave their lives for ours, and in great\r\nkindness taught us the revealed will of the Great Spirit through his Son\r\nJesus, the mediator between God and man. But while we were being taught\r\nto love the Lord our God with all our heart, mind, and strength, and our\r\nneighbors as ourselves, and our children were taught to lisp, “Our Father\r\nwho art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” bad men of the same race, whom\r\nwe thought of the same belief, shocked our faith in the revealed will\r\nof the Father, as they came among us with bitter oaths upon their lips,\r\nsomething we had never heard before, and cups of “fire-water” in their\r\nhands, something we had never seen before. They pressed the sparkling\r\nglasses to our lips and said, “Drink, and you will be happy.” We drank\r\nthereof, we and our children, but alas! like the serpent that charms to\r\nkill, the drink-habit coiled about the heart-strings of its victims,\r\nshocking onto death, friendship, love, honor, manhood—all that makes\r\nmen good and noble; crushing out all ambition, and leaving naught but a\r\nculprit vagabond in the place of a man.\r\n\r\nNow as we have been taught to believe that our first parents ate of the\r\nforbidden fruit, and fell, so we as fully believe this fire-water is\r\nthe hard-cider of the white man’s devil, made from the fruit of that\r\ntree that brought death into the world, and all our woes. The arrow, the\r\nscalping-knife, and the tomahawk used on the war-path were _merciful_\r\ncompared with it; _they_ were used in our defense, but the accursed\r\ndrink came like the serpent in the form of a dove. Many of our people\r\npartook of it without mistrust, as children pluck the flowers and clutch\r\na scorpion in their grasp; only when they feel the sting, they let the\r\nflowers fall. But Nature’s children had no such power; for when the\r\nviper’s fangs they felt, they only hugged the reptile the more closely\r\nto their breasts, while friends before them stood pleading with prayers\r\nand tears that they would let the deadly serpent drop. But all in vain.\r\nAlthough they promised so to do, yet with laughing grin and steps\r\nuncertain like the fool, they still more frequently guzzled down this\r\nhellish drug. Finally conscience ceased to give alarm, and, led by deep\r\ndespair to life’s last brink, and goaded by demons on every side, they\r\ncursed themselves, they cursed their friends, they cursed their beggar\r\nbabes and wives, they cursed their God, and died.\r\n\r\nYou say of us that we are treacherous, vindictive, and cruel; in answer\r\nto the charge, we declare to all the world with our hands uplifted before\r\nhigh Heaven, that before the white man came upon us, we were kind,\r\noutspoken, and forgiving. Our real character has been misunderstood\r\nbecause we have resented the breaking of treaties made with the United\r\nStates, as we honestly understood them. The few of our children who\r\nare permitted to attend your schools, in great pride tell us that they\r\nread in your own histories, how William Penn, a Quaker, and a good man,\r\nmade treaties with nineteen tribes of Indians, and that neither he nor\r\nthey ever broke them; and further, that during seventy years, while\r\nPennsylvania was controlled by the Quakers, not a drop of blood was shed\r\nnor a war-whoop sounded by our people. Your own historians, and our\r\ntraditions, show that for nearly two hundred years, different Eastern\r\npowers were striving for the mastery in the new world, and that our\r\npeople were persuaded by the different factions to take the war-path,\r\nbeing generally led by white men who had been discharged from prisons for\r\ncrimes committed in the Old World.\r\n\r\nRead the following, left on record by Peter Martyr who visited our\r\nforefathers in the day of Columbus.\r\n\r\n    “It is certain that the land among these people is as common\r\n    as the sun and water, and that ‘mine and thine,’ the seed of\r\n    all misery, have no place with them. They are content with\r\n    so little, that in so large a country they have rather a\r\n    superfluity than a scarceness: so that they seem to live in\r\n    the golden world without toil, living in open gardens not\r\n    intrenched with dykes, not divided with hedges, nor divided\r\n    with walls. They deal truly one with another, without laws,\r\n    without books, without judges. They take him for an evil\r\n    and mischievous man, who taketh pleasure in doing hurt to\r\n    another, and albeit they delight not in superfluities, yet they\r\n    make provision for the increase of such roots whereof they\r\n    make bread, content with such simple diet whereof health is\r\n    preserved and disease is avoided.”\r\n\r\nYour own histories show that Columbus on his first visit to our shores,\r\nin a message to the king and queen of Spain, paid our forefathers this\r\nbeautiful tribute:—\r\n\r\n    “They are loving, uncovetous people: so docile in all things\r\n    that I swear to your majesties there is not in the world\r\n    a better race or more delightful country. They love their\r\n    neighbors as themselves, and their talk is ever sweet and\r\n    gentle, accompanied with smiles; and though they be naked, yet\r\n    their manners are decorous and praiseworthy.”\r\n\r\nBut a few years passed away, and your historians left to be perused with\r\nshame, the following facts:—\r\n\r\n    “On the islands of the Atlantic Coast and in the populous\r\n    empires of Mexico and Peru, the Spaniards, through pretense\r\n    of friendship and religion, gained audience with chiefs and\r\n    kings, their families and attendants. They were received\r\n    with great kindness and courtesy but in return they most\r\n    treacherously seized and bound in chains the unsuspecting\r\n    natives; and as a ransom for their release, demanded large sums\r\n    of gold which were soon given by their subjects. But instead of\r\n    granting them freedom as promised, they were put to death in\r\n    a most shocking manner. Their subjects were then hunted down\r\n    like wild beasts, with bloodhounds, robbed and enslaved; while\r\n    under pretext to convert them to Christianity, the rack, the\r\n    scourge, and the fagot were used. Some were burned alive in\r\n    their thickets and fastnesses for refusing to work the mines as\r\n    slaves.”\r\n\r\nTradition says these acts of base ingratitude were communicated from\r\ntribe to tribe throughout the continent, and that a universal wail as one\r\nvoice went up from all the tribes of the unbroken wilderness: “We must\r\nbeat back these strangers from our shores before they seize our lands and\r\nhomes, or slavery or death are ours.”\r\n\r\nReader, pause here, close your eyes, shut out from your heart all\r\nprejudice against our race, and honestly consider the above records\r\npenned by the pale-faced historians centuries ago; and tell us in the\r\nname of eternal truth, and by all that is sacred and dear to mankind,\r\nwas there ever a people without the slightest reason of offense, more\r\ntreacherously imprisoned and scourged than we have been? And tell us,\r\nhave crime, despotism, violence, and slavery ever been dealt out in a\r\nmore wicked manner to crush out life and liberty; or was ever a people\r\nmore mortally offended than our forefathers were?\r\n\r\nAlmighty Spirit of humanity, let thy arms of compassion embrace and\r\nshield us from the charge of treachery, vindictiveness, and cruelty, and\r\nsave us from further oppression! And may the great chief of the United\r\nStates appoint no more broken-down or disappointed politicians as agents\r\nto deal with us, but may he select good men that are tried and true, men\r\nwho fear not to do the right. This is our prayer. What would remain for\r\nus if we were not allowed to pray? All else we acknowledge to be in the\r\nhands of this great republic.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that for years after the discovery of this country, we stood\r\nbefore the coming strangers, as a block of marble before the sculptor\r\nready to be shaped into a statue of grace and beauty; but in their greed\r\nfor gold, the block was hacked to pieces and destroyed. Child-like we\r\ntrusted in them with all our hearts; and as the young nestling while yet\r\nblind, swallows each morsel given by the parent bird, so we drank in\r\nall they said. They showed us the compass that guided them across the\r\ntrackless deep, and as its needle swung to and fro only resting to the\r\nnorth, we looked upon it as a thing of life from the eternal world. We\r\ncould not understand the lightning and thunder of their guns, believing\r\nthey were weapons of the gods; nor could we fathom their wisdom in\r\nknowing and telling us the exact time in which the sun or moon should be\r\ndarkened; hence we looked upon them as divine; we revered them—yes, we\r\ntrusted in them, as infants trust in the arms of their mothers.\r\n\r\nBut again and again was our confidence betrayed, until we were compelled\r\nto know that greed for gold was all the balance-wheel they had. The\r\nremnant of the beasts are now wild and keep beyond the arrow’s reach, the\r\nfowls fly high in air, the fish hide themselves in deep waters. We have\r\nbeen driven from the homes of our childhood and from the burial places of\r\nour kindred and friends, and scattered far westward into desert places,\r\nwhere multitudes have died from homesickness, cold, and hunger, and are\r\nsuffering and dying still for want of food and blankets.\r\n\r\nAs the hunted deer close chased all day long, when night comes on, weary\r\nand tired, lies down to rest, mourning for companions of the morning\r\nherd, all scattered, dead, and gone, so we through weary years have tried\r\nto find some place to safely rest. But all in vain! Our throbbing hearts\r\nunceasing say, “The hounds are howling on our tracks.” Our sad history\r\nhas been told by weeping parents to their children from generation to\r\ngeneration; and as the fear of the fox in the duckling is hatched, so the\r\nwrongs we have suffered are transmitted to our children, and they look\r\nupon the white man with distrust as soon as they are born. Hence our\r\nworst acts of cruelty should be viewed by all the world with Christian\r\ncharity, as being but the echo of bad treatment dealt out to us.\r\n\r\nTherefore we pray our critics everywhere to be not like the thoughtless\r\nboy who condemns the toiling bees wherever found, as vindictive and\r\ncruel, because in robbing their homes he once received the poisoned darts\r\nthat nature gave for their defense. Our strongest defense against the\r\nonward marching hordes, we fully realize is as useless as the struggles\r\nof a lamb borne high in air, pierced to its heart, in the talons of the\r\neagle.\r\n\r\nWe never shall be happy here any more; we gaze into the faces of our\r\nlittle ones, for smiles of infancy to please, and into the faces of our\r\nyoung men and maidens, for joys of youth to cheer advancing age, but\r\nalas! instead of smiles of joy we find but looks of sadness there. Then\r\nwe fully realize in the anguish of our souls that their young and tender\r\nhearts, in keenest sympathy with ours, have drank in the sorrows we have\r\nfelt, and their sad faces reflect it back to us again. No rainbow of\r\npromise spans the dark cloud of our afflictions; no cheering hopes are\r\npainted on our midnight sky. We only stand with folded arms and watch and\r\nwait to see the future deal with us no better than the past. No cheer\r\nof sympathy is given us; but in answer to our complaints we are told\r\nthe triumphal march of the Eastern race westward is by the unalterable\r\ndecree of nature, termed by them “survival of the fittest.” And so we\r\nstand as upon the sea-shore, chained hand and foot, while the incoming\r\ntide of the great ocean of civilization rises slowly but surely to\r\noverwhelm us.\r\n\r\nBut a few more generations and the last child of the forest will have\r\npassed into the world beyond—into that kingdom where Tche-ban-yot-booz,\r\nthe Great Spirit, dwelleth, who loveth justice and mercy, and hateth\r\nevil; who has declared the “fittest” in his kingdom shall be those alone\r\nthat hear and aid his children when they cry, and that love him and keep\r\nhis commandments. In that kingdom many of our people in faith believe he\r\nwill summon the pale-faced spirits to take position on his left, and the\r\nred spirits upon his right, and that he will say, “Sons and daughters of\r\nthe forest, your prayers for deliverance from the iron heel of oppression\r\nthrough centuries past are recorded in this book now open before me, made\r\nfrom the bark of the white birch, a tree under which for generations\r\npast you have mourned and wept. On its pages silently has been recorded\r\nyour sad history. It has touched my heart with pity and I will have\r\ncompassion.”\r\n\r\nThen turning to his left he will say, “Sons and daughters of the East,\r\nall hear and give heed unto my words. While on Earth I did great and\r\nmarvelous things for you—I gave my only Son, who declared unto you my\r\nwill, and as you had freely received, to so freely give, and declare the\r\ngospel unto all people. A few of you have kept the faith; and through\r\nopposition and great tribulation have labored hard and honestly for the\r\nredemption of mankind regardless of race or color. To all such I now\r\ngive divine power to fly on lightning wings throughout my universe. Now,\r\ntherefore, listen; and when the great drum beats, let all try their\r\npowers to fly. Only those can rise who acted well their part on earth to\r\nredeem and save the fallen.”\r\n\r\nThe drum will be sounded, and the innumerable multitude will appear like\r\nsome vast sea of wounded birds struggling to rise. We shall behold it,\r\nand shall hear their fluttering as the rumbling of an earthquake, and to\r\nour surprise shall see but a scattering few in triumph rise, and hear\r\ntheir songs re-echo through the vault of heaven as they sing, “Glory to\r\nthe highest who hath redeemed and saved us.”\r\n\r\nThen the Great Spirit will speak with a voice of thunder to the remaining\r\nshame-faced multitude: “Hear ye: it is through great mercy that you have\r\nbeen permitted to enter these happy hunting-grounds. Therefore I charge\r\nyou in presence of these red men that you are guilty of having tyrannized\r\nover them in many and strange ways. I find you guilty of having made\r\nwanton wholesale butchery of their game and fish, I find you guilty of\r\nusing tobacco, a poisonous weed made only to kill parasites on plants and\r\nlice on man and beast. You found it with the red men, who used it only\r\nin smoking the pipe of peace, to confirm their contracts, in place of a\r\nseal. But you multiplied its use, not only in smoking, but in chewing,\r\nsnuffing, thus forming unhealthy, filthy habits, and by cigarettes, the\r\nabomination of abominations, learned little children to hunger and thirst\r\nafter the father and mother of palsy and cancers.\r\n\r\n“I find you guilty of tagging after the pay agents sent out by the\r\ngreat chief of the United States, among the Indians, to pay off their\r\nbirth-right claims to home, and liberty, and native lands, and then\r\nsneaking about their agencies by deceit and trickery, cheating and\r\nrobbing them of their money and goods, thus leaving them poor and naked.\r\nI also find you guilty of following the trail of Christian missionaries\r\ninto the wilderness among the natives, and when they had set up my\r\naltars, and the great work of redemption had just begun, and some in\r\nfaith believed, you then and there most wickedly set up the idol of\r\nman-tchi-man-in-to (the devil), and there stuck out your sign, SAMPLE\r\nROOMS. You then dealt out to the sons of the forest a most damnable drug,\r\nfitly termed on earth by Christian women, ‘a beverage of hell,’ which\r\ndestroyed both body and soul, taking therefore, all their money and\r\nblankets, and scrupling not to take in pawn the Bibles given them by my\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n“Therefore know ye, this much-abused race shall enjoy the liberties of\r\nthese happy hunting-grounds, while I teach them my will, which you were\r\nin duty bound to do while on earth. But instead, you blocked up the\r\nhighway that led to heaven, that the car of salvation might not pass\r\nover. Had you done your duty, they as well as you would now be rejoicing\r\nin glory with my saints with whom you, fluttering, tried this day in vain\r\nto rise. But now I say unto you, Stand back! you shall not tread upon the\r\nheels of my people, nor tyrannize over them any more. Neither shall you\r\nwith gatling-gun or otherwise disturb or break up their prayer-meetings\r\nin camp any more. Neither shall you practice with weapons of lightning\r\nand thunder any more. Neither shall you use tobacco in any shape, way,\r\nor manner. Neither shall you touch, taste, handle, make, buy, or sell\r\nanything that can intoxicate any more. And know ye, ye cannot buy out\r\nthe law or skulk by justice here; and if any attempt is made on your\r\npart to break these commandments, I shall forthwith grant these red men\r\nof America great power, and delegate them to cast you out of Paradise,\r\nand hurl you headlong through its outer gates into the endless abyss\r\nbeneath—far beyond, where darkness meets with light, there to dwell, and\r\nthus shut you out from my presence and the presence of angels and the\r\nlight of heaven forever and ever.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “And as the young nestling while yet blind, swallows each\r\nmorsel given by the parent bird, so we drank in all they said.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “As the hunted deer close chased all day long, when night\r\ncomes on, weary and tired, lies down to rest.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “As the fear of the fox in the duckling is hatched, so the\r\nwrongs we have suffered are transmitted to our children.”]",
