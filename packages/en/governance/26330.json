If the men and things to be encountered within are\r\nreal--did live or live now--you must deal with them one way. If these\r\nembodiments are but figments of my mind and pen, you must regard them\r\nfrom a different view-point. Therefore, before turning the page, it\r\nbehooves you to find for yourself an answer to the grave question:\r\n\r\nIs it the truth that is dealt with here? In weighing the evidence\r\nremember:\r\n\r\nMy profession is business. My writing is an incident. \"Frenzied Finance\"\r\nwas set down during the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth hours of busy\r\ndays. I pass it up as the history of affairs of which I was a part. The\r\nmen who move within the book's pages are still on the turf. A period of\r\ntwelve years is covered. So far, eighteen instalments, in all some\r\n400,000 words, have been published. The spigot is still running. I have\r\nwritten from memory, necessarily. While it is true that fiction is\r\nexpressed in the same forms and phrases as truth, no man ever lived who\r\ncould shape 400,000 words into the kinds of pictures I have painted and\r\npass them off for aught but what they were. The character of my palette\r\nmade it mechanically impossible to shade or temper the pigments, for the\r\nstory was written in instalments, and circumstances were such that often\r\none month's issue was out to the public before the next instalment was\r\non paper. Considering all this, the consistency of the chronicle as it\r\nstands is the best evidence of its truth. In submitting it to my readers\r\nI desire to reiterate:\r\n\r\nIt _is_ truth--of the kind that carries its own bell and candle. Within\r\nthe narrative itself are the reagents required to test and prove its\r\ngenuineness. Were man endowed with the propensity of a Münchhausen, the\r\ncunning of a Machiavelli, the imagination of Scheherezade, the ability\r\nof a Shakespeare, and the hellishness of his Satanic Majesty, he could\r\nnot play upon 400,000 words, or one-quarter that number, and make the\r\nplay peal truth for a single hour to the audience who will read this\r\nbook, or to one-thousandth part the audience that has already read it in\r\n_Everybody's Magazine_.\r\n\r\nSuch as the story is, it is before you. If in its perusal you fathom my\r\nintentions, my hopes, my desires, I shall have been repaid for the pain\r\nits writing has brought me. At least you will find the history of a\r\ncolossal business affair involving millions of dollars and manned by the\r\nfinancial leaders of the moment. It is a fair representation of\r\nfinancial methods and commercial morals as they exist in America at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. As a contemporary document the\r\nnarrative should have value; as history it is not, I believe, without\r\ninterest. As a message it has had its influence. Indeed, it is not an\r\nexaggeration to say that no man in his own generation has seen such a\r\ncrop come forth from seed of his own sowing since the long bygone days\r\nwhen the wandering king planted dragons' teeth on the Phoenician plain\r\nand raised up an army of warriors.\r\n\r\nYours very truly\r\n    Thomas W. Lawson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be set down in this book, in as simple and direct a fashion\r\nas I can write it, the story of Amalgamated Copper and of the \"System\"\r\nof which it is the most flagrant example. This \"System\" is a process or\r\na device for the incubation of wealth from the people's savings in the\r\nbanks, trust, and insurance companies, and the public funds. Through its\r\nworkings during the last twenty years there has grown up in this country\r\na set of colossal corporations in which unmeasured success and continued\r\nimmunity from punishment have bred an insolent disregard of law, of\r\ncommon morality, and of public and private right, together with a grim\r\ndetermination to hold on to, at all hazards, the great possessions they\r\nhave gulped or captured. It is the same \"System\" which has taken from\r\nthe millions of our people billions of dollars, and given them over to a\r\nscore or two of men with power to use and enjoy them as absolutely as\r\nthough these billions had been earned dollar by dollar by the labor of\r\ntheir bodies and minds. Yet in telling the story of Amalgamated, the\r\nmost brazen and voracious maw of this \"System,\" I desire it understood\r\nthat I take no issue with men; it is with a principle I am concerned.\r\nWith the men I have had close and intimate intercourse, and from my\r\nknowledge of the means they have used, and the manner in which they have\r\nused them, and the causes and effects of their performances, I have no\r\nhesitation in stating that the good they have done, the evils they have\r\ncreated, and the indelible imprints they have made on mankind are the\r\nproducts of a condition and not of their individualities, and that if\r\nnot one of them had ever been born the same good and evil would to-day\r\nexist. Others would have done what they did, and would have to answer\r\nfor what has been done, as they must. So I say the men are merely\r\nindividuals; the \"System\" is the thing at fault, and it is the \"System\"\r\nthat must be rectified. Better far for me not to tell the story I am\r\ngoing to tell; better far for the victims of Amalgamated not to know who\r\nplundered them and how, than to have them know it only to wreak\r\nvengeance on individuals and overlook the \"System,\" which, if allowed to\r\ncontinue, surely will in time, a short time, destroy the nation by\r\nprecipitating fratricidal war.\r\n\r\nThe enormous losses, millions upon millions--to my personal knowledge\r\nover a hundred millions of dollars--which were made because of\r\nAmalgamated; the large number of suicides--to my personal knowledge over\r\nthirty--which were directly caused by Amalgamated; the large number of\r\npreviously reputable citizens who were made prison convicts--to my\r\npersonal knowledge over twenty--directly because of Amalgamated, were\r\ncaused by acts of this \"System\" of which Henry H. Rogers and his\r\nimmediate associates were the direct administrators; and yet Mr. Rogers\r\nand his immediate associates, while these great wrongs were occurring,\r\nled social lives which, measured by the most rigid yardstick of mental\r\nor moral rectitude, were as near perfect as it is possible for human\r\nlives to be. As husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, friends, they were\r\nideal, cleanly of body and of mind, with heads filled with sentiment and\r\nhearts filled with sympathies; their personal lives were like their\r\nhomes and their gardens--revealing only the brightest things of this\r\nworld, the singing, humming, sweet-smelling things which so strongly\r\nspeak to us of the other world we are yet to know. As workers in the\r\nworld's vineyards, they labored six days and rested upon the Sabbath,\r\nand gave thanks to Him from whom all blessings flow that He allowed\r\nthem, His humble creatures, to have their earthly being. And yet these\r\nmen, to whose eyes I have seen come the tears for others' sufferings,\r\nand whose voices I have heard grow husky in recounting the woes of their\r\nless fortunate brothers--these men under the spell of the brutal code of\r\nmodern dollar-making are converted into beasts of prey, and put to shame\r\nthe denizens of the deep which devour their kind that they may live.\r\n\r\nIn the harness of the \"System\" these men knew no Sabbath, no Him; they\r\nhad no time to offer thanks, no care for earthly or celestial being;\r\nfrom their eyes no human power could squeeze a tear, no suffering wring\r\na pang from their hearts. They were immune to every feeling known to God\r\nor man. They knew only dollars. Their relatives of a moment since, their\r\nfriends of yesterday and long, long ago, they regarded only as lumps of\r\nmatter with which to feed the whirring, grinding, gnashing mill which\r\npoured forth into their bins--dollars.\r\n\r\nIn telling the story of Amalgamated I hope to have profited by my long\r\nand intimate study of this cruel, tigerishly cruel \"System,\" so as to be\r\nable to deaden myself to all those human sympathies which I have heard\r\nits votaries so many times subordinate to \"It's business.\" I shall try\r\nonly to keep before me how the Indians of the forest, as our forefathers\r\ndrove them farther and farther into the unknown West, got bitter\r\nconsolation out of the oft-chanted precept of their white brethren of\r\ncivilization, \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" reminding myself\r\nthat whatever of misery or unhappiness my story may bring to the few, it\r\nwill be as nothing to that which they have brought to the many.\r\n\r\nIn asking for the serious, earnest consideration of the public, I shall\r\nbe honest in giving to it my qualifications, my motives, and my desires\r\nfor writing this narrative. For thirty-four years I have been actively\r\nconnected with matters financial. As banker, broker, and corporation\r\nman, I have, from the vantage-point of one who actually handled the\r\nthings he studied, studied the causes which created the conditions which\r\nmade possible the \"System\" which produced the Amalgamated affair. In my\r\nthirty-four years of business experience I have seen the great fortunes,\r\nwhich are the motive power of the \"System\" referred to, come out of the\r\nfar West as specks upon the financial horizon and grow and grow as they\r\ntravelled Eastward, until in their length, breadth, and thickness they\r\nobscured the rising sun. At short range I have seen the giant money\r\nmachine put together; I have touched elbows with the men who made it, as\r\nthey fitted this wheel and adjusted that gear, while at the same time I\r\nbroke bread and slept with the every-day people who, with the industry\r\nof the ant and the patience of the spider, toiled to pile in the\r\npennies, the nickels, and the dimes which have kept the \"System's\"\r\nhopper full.\r\n\r\nAt my first meeting with the creators of Amalgamated it was clearly and\r\ndistinctly understood that under no circumstances would I enlist in that\r\n\"System's\" interests other than for such special services as, after due\r\nthought and investigation, I should decide to be such as I could in\r\nfairness to myself and my clients work for; and when I give the details\r\nof this first meeting in my narrative it will be evident to its readers\r\nthat in telling the story of Amalgamated I am violating no confidence,\r\nnor in any way encroaching upon the niceties of that business code which\r\nis, and should be, the foundation of all legitimate financial dealings,\r\nnor in any way misusing knowledge which, if acquired under other\r\ncircumstances, might be sacred.\r\n\r\nAmalgamated was one service the \"System\" asked of me. It was created\r\nbecause of my work. It was largely because of my efforts that its\r\nfoundation was successfully laid. It was very largely because of what I\r\nstood for and because of the public's confidence in the fulfilment of\r\nthe promises I made that the public invested its savings to an extent of\r\nover $200,000,000; and it was almost wholly because of the broken\r\npromises and trickery of the creators of the \"System\" that the public\r\nlost the enormous sums it did.\r\n\r\nMy motives for writing the story of Amalgamated are manifold: I have\r\nunwittingly been made the instrument by which thousands upon thousands\r\nof investors in America and Europe have been plundered. I wish them to\r\nknow my position as to the past that they may acquit me of intentional\r\nwrong-doing; as to the present that they may know that I am using all my\r\npowers to right the wrongs that have been committed, and as to the\r\nfuture that they may see how I propose to compel restitution.\r\n\r\nMy desire in writing the story of Amalgamated, while tinged perhaps with\r\nhatred for and revenge against the \"System\" as a whole and some of its\r\nvotaries, is more truly pervaded with a strong conviction that the most\r\neffective way to educate the public to realize the evils of which such\r\naffairs as the Amalgamated are the direct result, is to expose before it\r\nthe brutal facts as to the conception, birth, and nursery-breeding of\r\nthis the foremost of all the unsavory offspring of the \"System.\" Thus it\r\nmay learn that it is within its power to destroy the brood already in\r\nexistence and render impossible similar creations.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my task I shall describe such parts of the general\r\nfinancial structure as will place my readers, especially those\r\nunfamiliar with its more complicated conditions, in a mental state to\r\ncomprehend the methods by which the savings they think are safely\r\nguarded in the banks, trust and insurance companies, are so manipulated\r\nby the votaries of frenzied finance as to be in constant jeopardy. I\r\nshall show them that while the press, the books, the stump, and our\r\nhalls of statesmanship are full to overflowing with the whys,\r\nwherefores, and what-nots of \"tariff,\" \"currency,\" \"silver,\" \"gold,\" and\r\n\"labor\"; while our market systems are perfected educational machines for\r\ndisseminating accurate statistics about the necessaries and luxuries of\r\nlife, the water and land carriers, real estate, and other material\r\nthings which the people have been taught to believe are the only things\r\nthat vitally affect their savings; that while they imagine they\r\nunderstand the system by which speculation and investments are\r\ncontrolled and worked, and that the causes and effects of this system\r\nare at all times get-at-able by them through their bankers and their\r\nbrokers; there is a tangible, complicated, yet simple trick of financial\r\nlegerdemain, operated twenty-four hours in each day in the year, and\r\nwhich the press, the books, the politicians, and the statesmen never\r\ntouch upon--a trick by means of which the savings of the people and the\r\npublic funds of the Government, whether in the national banks,\r\nsavings-banks, trust or insurance companies, are always at the absolute\r\nservice and mercy of the votaries of frenzied finance.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the course of my story of Amalgamated will come a few\r\nkindergarten pictures of how the necessaries and luxuries of the people\r\nare \"incorporated\"; of how the evidences of corporation ownership are\r\nmanufactured; of the individuals who \"manufacture\" them; of the\r\nindividuals who control and make or unmake their values; of the\r\nmeeting-place of these individuals, within and without the\r\nstock-exchanges; of some of the corporations and of some of the signs\r\nand tokens of corporation ownership; of some of their histories; of some\r\nof their doings, and of some of their contemplated doings. These\r\nkindergarten pictures I will endeavor to paint, not in that\r\n\"over-the-head\" verbosity or \"under-the-feet\" profundity and intricacy\r\nof the political economy pedant, which are as the canvases of the\r\nWhistler school to the masses; but rather will I use the brush of the\r\nartisan who in giving us our white fences, our gray cottages, and our\r\ngreen blinds sets off those things which make up the pictures the people\r\nreally understand and dearly prize.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years the public has heard many stories of this\r\nJuggernaut \"System,\" which has grown to be the greatest private power in\r\nour land--greater almost than the power which governs the nation,\r\nbecause it is not only great within itself but by its peculiar workings\r\nis really a part of the power which governs the people. Particularly has\r\nit been told the story of Standard Oil by Mr. Henry D. Lloyd in his able\r\nwork, \"Wealth Against Commonwealth,\" and by Miss Ida M. Tarbell in her\r\nrecent historical sketches; but however thorough these writers may have\r\nbeen in gathering the facts, statistics, and evidences, however\r\nrelentless their pens and vivid their pictures, they dealt but with\r\nthings that are dead; things that to the present generation are but\r\nskeletons whose dry and whitened bones cannot possibly bring to the\r\nhearts, minds, and souls of the men and women of to-day that\r\nall-consuming passion for revenge, that burning desire for justice,\r\nwithout which no movement to benefit the people can be made successful.\r\n\r\nIn telling my story I shall, for I must, tell it fairly, and to make\r\nsure of this I pledge myself to keep to the exact facts as they\r\noccurred, not allowing myself to be overawed by their greatness into\r\ncontracting them, nor to be tempted by their littleness into expanding\r\nthem. In doing this I know, because of the peculiarity of the subject\r\nand my intimate relation to it, no other way than to do it in the first\r\nperson. As I have already stated, I would prefer to deal with my subject\r\nthrough the principles involved rather than with the men concerned; but\r\nas I shall be compelled to call spades spades, I must, of necessity, use\r\nthe names of men and of institutions fearlessly and without favor.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning it will be necessary, for that clear understanding of\r\nthe whole subject which is one of my principal objects, to treat at\r\nsufficient length the Bay State Gas intricacies and trickeries, in which\r\nin a certain sense Amalgamated had its being. This will compel me to\r\ndevote a chapter to one of the most picturesquely notorious characters\r\nof the age, John Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, of Delaware, Everywhere, and\r\nNowhere.\r\n\r\nThe main part of my narrative must of necessity deal with the two real\r\nheads of Standard Oil and Amalgamated, Mr. Henry H. Rogers and Mr.\r\nWilliam Rockefeller; and with the biggest financial institution of\r\nAmerica, if not of the world, the National City Bank of New York, and\r\nits head and dominating spirit, Mr. James Stillman.\r\n\r\nAn important chapter should be that devoted to the conception and\r\nformation of the United Metals Selling Company, which was specially\r\norganized to control the copper industry of the world without coming\r\nwithin the restrictions of the laws for the prevention or regulation of\r\nmonopolies.\r\n\r\nI shall also deal at length with a notorious character, who, like the\r\nspot upon the sun, looms up in all American copper affairs whenever they\r\nappear in the full vision of the public eye--Mr. F. Augustus Heinze, of\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\nThere will be a chapter of more or less length devoted to one of the\r\nmost important episodes in Amalgamated affairs, wherein I shall describe\r\none of Wall Street's most picturesque, able, and intensely interesting\r\nmen, Mr. James R. Keene.\r\n\r\nI shall touch on a bit of the nation's history in which within a few\r\ndays of the national election of 1896 a hurry-up call for additional\r\nfunds to the extent of $5,000,000 was so promptly met as to overturn the\r\npeople in five States and thereby preserve the destinies of the\r\nRepublican party, of which I am and have always been a member.\r\n\r\nI shall draw a picture of two dress-suit cases of money being slipped\r\nacross the table at the foot of a judge's bench in the court-room, from\r\nits custodian to its new owners, upon the rendering of a court decision;\r\nand I shall show how the new owners frustrated a plot having for its\r\nobject their waylaying and the recovery of the bags of money.\r\n\r\nI shall devote some space to pointing out the evils and dangers of the\r\nlatter-day methods of corrupting law-makers, and show how one entire\r\nMassachusetts Legislature, with the exception of a few members, was\r\ndealt with as openly as the fishmongers procure their stock-in-trade\r\nupon the wharves; how upon the last day of the Legislature, because\r\ntheir deferred cash payments were not promptly forthcoming, its members\r\nturned, and made necessary the hurried departure for foreign shores of a\r\ngreat lawyer and his secretary, with bags of quickly gathered gold, and\r\nall evidences of the crimes committed and attempted; how after the ship\r\narrived at an island in foreign seas the great lawyer's dead body\r\nreceived hurried burial, and his secretary's was later dropped, with\r\nweights about its feet, to the ocean's depths; and how ever since the\r\nnatives whisper among themselves their gruesome suspicions.\r\n\r\nI shall devote a chapter to the doings of certain financial reputation\r\nsandbaggers and blackmailers; show how through their agencies they hold\r\nup corporations and their managers for large sums, which upon being paid\r\nstart into motion a perfected system for the false moulding of public\r\nopinion for the purpose of making more easy the plundering of the\r\npeople. I shall photograph the men and draw accurate diagrams of the\r\nmachinery through which their nefarious trade is carried on.\r\n\r\nMy story will carry me down Wall Street, into the Stock Exchange,\r\nthrough its hundred and one or million and one open and hidden passages,\r\nand into State Street, that ever-hung hammock of financial somnolence,\r\nand into the courts of justice of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Massachusetts, and Montana, and into many other interesting\r\nabodes of justice and injustice, of trickery, fraud, and simple, honest\r\ntrustfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen my story is ended and the great American people, whose simple but\r\nproud boast is that they cannot be fooled in the same place by the same\r\nmethods and the same instruments twice, know as much as I now know of\r\nAmalgamated and its relation to the \"System\" which has for years as\r\nboldly, as coarsely, and as cruelly robbed them as the coolie slaves are\r\nrobbed by their masters--it will be for them to decide whether my story\r\nhas been, because of the facts which entered into it, so well told that\r\nthey will not be satisfied with the restitution of the vast sums which\r\nthe Amalgamated took from them, which United States Steel took from\r\nthem, and which other financial enterprises took in lesser amounts but\r\nby equally flagrant methods; but will demand the overthrow of the\r\n\"System\" itself. It will be for them to decide; and if their decision\r\nshould be for a conclusive revolt, I shall be amply repaid for the pains\r\nand the miseries which must necessarily follow in the wake of a task\r\nsuch as the one I undertook when I decided to tell the story of\r\nAmalgamated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n        FOREWORD                                                  vii\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n     I.

Because\r\nof it the people have sustained incalculable losses and have suffered\r\nuntold miseries.\r\n\r\nBut for the existence of the National City Bank of New York, the\r\ntremendous losses and necessarily corresponding profits could not have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nI laid out the plans upon which Amalgamated was constructed, and, had\r\nthey been followed, there would have been reared a great financial\r\nedifice, immensely profitable, permanently prosperous, one of the\r\nworld's big institutions.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of which Amalgamated was the consequence had their birth\r\nin Bay State Gas. To explain them I must go back a few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 J. Edward Addicks, of Delaware, Everywhere, and Nowhere, the\r\nBoston Gas King, invaded the gas preserves of the \"Standard Oil\" in\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y., and the \"Standard Oil,\" to compel him to withdraw,\r\nmoved on his pre-empted gas domains in Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\nLate in 1894 a fierce battle was raging in Boston between Gas King\r\nAddicks and Gas King Rogers; the very air was filled with denunciation\r\nand defiance--bribery and municipal corruption; and King Addicks was\r\ndefeated all along the line and in full retreat, with his ammunition\r\ndown to the last few rounds.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1895 I took command of the Addicks forces against \"Standard\r\nOil.\"\r\n\r\nBy the middle of 1895 the Addicks troopers had the \"Standard Oil\"\r\ninvaders \"on the run.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1895, Henry H. Rogers and myself came together for the first\r\ntime, at his house in New York, and we practically settled the Boston\r\ngas war.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1896 we actually settled the gas war, and \"Standard Oil\"\r\ntransferred all its Boston gas properties ($6,000,000) to the Addicks\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1896, the whole Bay State Gas outfit passed from the control\r\nof Addicks and his cohorts into the hands of a receiver, and as a result\r\nof this receivership, with its accumulated complications, \"Standard\r\nOil,\" in November, 1896, regained all its old Boston companies, and in\r\naddition all the Addicks companies, with the exception of the Bay State\r\nGas Company of Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 I perfected and formulated the plans for \"Coppers,\" a broad and\r\ncomprehensive project, having for its basis the buying and consolidating\r\nof all the best-producing copper properties in Europe and America, and\r\nthe educating of the world up to their great merits as safe and\r\nprofitable investments.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 I laid these plans before \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1898 \"Standard Oil\" was so far educated up to my plans on \"Coppers\"\r\nas to accept them.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Amalgamated, intended to be the second or third section of\r\n\"Coppers,\" was suddenly shifted by \"Standard Oil\" into the first\r\nsection, and with a full head of steam ran out of the \"City Bank\"\r\nstation, carrying the largest and best train-load of passengers ever\r\nsent to destruction on any financial trunk-line.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, after the allotment of the Amalgamated public subscription, the\r\npublic for the first time, in a dazed and benumbed way, realized it had\r\nbeen \"taken in\" on this subscription, and a shiver went down America's\r\nfinancial spinal column.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, after the price of Amalgamated had slumped to 75 instead of\r\nadvancing to 150, to 200, as had been promised, the \"Standard\r\nOil\"-Amalgamated-City Bank fraternity called Wall Street's king of\r\nmanipulators, James R. Keene, to the rescue, and under his adroit\r\nhandling of the stock in the market Amalgamated was sent soaring over\r\nits flotation price of 100.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Boston & Montana and Butte & Boston, after long delay, drew out\r\nof the \"Standard Oil\" station as the second section of Amalgamated,\r\ncarrying an immense load of investors and speculators to what was at\r\nthat time confidently believed would be Dollar Utopia; and the price of\r\nthe enlarged Amalgamated fairly flew to 130. These were the stocks which\r\nI had originally advertised would be part of the first section of the\r\nconsolidated \"Coppers,\" and which, after Amalgamated had been run in\r\nahead of them, I advertised would follow in due course.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1901 President McKinley was assassinated, and the\r\ngreat panic which might have ensued was averted by the marvellous power\r\nof J. Pierpont Morgan.\r\n\r\nThen the Amalgamated dividend, without warning and in open defiance of\r\nthe absolute pledges of its creators, was cut, and the public, including\r\neven James R. Keene, found itself on that wild toboggan whirl which\r\nlanded it battered and sore, at the foot of a financial precipice.\r\n\r\nThis, briefly, is the tortuous course of Amalgamated, and it is along\r\nthis twisting, winding, up-alley-and-down-lane way I must ask my readers\r\nto travel if they would know the story as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE \"SYSTEM'S\" METHOD OF FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the greatest thoroughfare in the greatest city of\r\nthe New World is a huge structure of plain gray-stone. Solid as a\r\nprison, towering as a steeple, its cold and forbidding façade seems to\r\nrebuke the heedless levity of the passing crowd, and frown on the\r\nfrivolity of the stray sunbeams which in the late afternoon play around\r\nits impassive cornices. Men point to its stern portals, glance quickly\r\nup at the rows of unwinking windows, nudge each other, and hurry onward,\r\nas the Spaniards used to do when going by the offices of the\r\nInquisition. The building is No. 26 Broadway.\r\n\r\n26 Broadway, New York City, is the home of the Standard Oil. Its\r\ncountless miles of railroads may zigzag in and out of every State and\r\ncity in America, and its never-ending twistings of snaky pipe-lines\r\nburrow into all parts of the North American continent which are\r\nlubricated by nature; its mines may be in the West, its manufactories in\r\nthe East, its colleges in the South, and its churches in the North; its\r\nhead-quarters may be in the centre of the universe and its branches on\r\nevery shore washed by the ocean; its untold millions may levy tribute\r\nwherever the voice of man is heard, but its home is the tall stone\r\nbuilding in old New York, which under the name \"26 Broadway\" has become\r\nalmost as well known wherever dollars are juggled as is \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\nWall Street and the financial world know that there are two \"Standard\r\nOils,\" but to the public there is no clear distinction between Standard\r\nOil, the corporation which deals in oil and things which pertain to the\r\nmanufacture and transportation of oil, and \"Standard Oil,\" the giant,\r\nindefinite system which sometimes embraces all the \"Standard Oil\" group\r\nof individuals and corporations, and sometimes only certain of the\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThis giant creature, \"Standard Oil,\" can best be described so that the\r\naverage man may understand it as a group of money-owners--some\r\nindividuals and some corporations--who have a right to use the name\r\n\"Standard Oil\" in any business undertakings they engage in. The right to\r\nuse the name is of priceless value, for it carries with it \"assured\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nStandard Oil, the seller of oil to the people, transacts its business as\r\ndoes any other corporation. It plays no part in my story and I shall not\r\nhereafter touch upon its affairs, but confine my meaning, wherever I use\r\nthe name \"Standard Oil,\" to the larger and many times more important\r\n\"System.\"\r\n\r\nThere are only three men who can lend the name \"Standard Oil,\" even in\r\nthe most remote way to any project, for there is no more heinous crime\r\nagainst the \"Standard Oil\" decalogue than using the name \"Standard Oil\"\r\nunauthorizedly. The three men are Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller,\r\nand John D. Rockefeller. Sometimes John D. Rockefeller uses the name\r\nalone in projects in which Henry H. Rogers and William Rockefeller have\r\nno interests. Henry H. Rogers or William Rockefeller seldom, if ever,\r\nuses the name in projects with which neither of the other two is\r\nassociated. Sometimes, but not often, John D. and William Rockefeller\r\nuse the name in connection with projects of their own in which Henry H.\r\nRogers has no interest. Henry H. Rogers and John D. Rockefeller, I\r\nbelieve, never are associated in projects in which William Rockefeller\r\nhas no interest. Henry H. Rogers and William Rockefeller frequently\r\nbring to bear the influence of the magic-working syllables in connection\r\nwith joint affairs in which John D. Rockefeller has no interest--in\r\nfact, during the past ten years the name \"Standard Oil\" has been used\r\nmore in their combined undertakings than in all others put together.\r\n\r\nThere are eight distinct groups of individuals and corporations which go\r\nto make up the big \"Standard Oil\":\r\n\r\n1st. The Standard Oil, seller of oil to the people, which is made up of\r\nmany sub-corporations either by actual ownership or by ownership of\r\ntheir stock or bonds. Probably no person other than Henry H. Rogers,\r\nWilliam Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller knows exactly what the\r\nassets of the Standard Oil corporation are, although John D.\r\nRockefeller, Jr., son of John D. Rockefeller, and William G.\r\nRockefeller, that able and excellent business man, son of William\r\nRockefeller and the probable future head of \"Standard Oil,\" are being\r\nrapidly educated in this great secret. In this first institution all\r\n\"Standard Oil\" individuals and estates are direct owners.\r\n\r\n2d. Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller,\r\nactive heads, and included with them their sons.\r\n\r\n3d. A large group of active captains and first lieutenants, men who\r\nconduct the affairs of the different corporations or sections of\r\ncorporations in which some or all of the \"Standard Oil\" are interested.\r\nMany of these are the sons or the second generation of men who held like\r\npositions in Standard Oil's earlier days. Of these Daniel O'Day and\r\nCharles Pratt are fair examples.\r\n\r\n4th. A large group of captains retired from active service in the\r\nStandard Oil army, who participate only in a general way in the\r\nmanagement of its affairs, and whose principal business is looking after\r\ntheir own investments. These men are each worth from $5,000,000 or\r\n$10,000,000 to $50,000,000 or $75,000,000. The Paynes and the Flaglers\r\nare fair illustrations of this group.\r\n\r\n5th. The estates of deceased members of this wonderful \"Standard Oil\"\r\nfamily, which are still largely controlled by some or all of the\r\nprominent \"Standard Oil\" men.\r\n\r\n6th. \"Standard Oil\" banks and banking institutions, and the system of\r\nnational banks, trust companies, and insurance companies, of which\r\n\"Standard Oil\" has, by ownership and otherwise, practically absolute\r\ncontrol. The head of this group is James Stillman, and it is when these\r\ninstitutions are called into play in connection with \"Standard Oil\"\r\nbusiness that he is one of the \"Standard Oil\" leaders, second to neither\r\nof the Rockefellers nor to Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\n7th. The \"Standard Oil\" army of followers, capitalists, and workers in\r\nall parts of the world, men who require nothing more than the order, \"Go\r\nahead,\" \"Pull off,\" \"Buy,\" \"Sell,\" or \"Stand Pat,\" to render as absolute\r\nobedience and enthusiastic cooperation as though they knew, to the\r\nsmallest detail, the purposes which lay behind the giving of the order.\r\n\r\n8th. The countless hordes of politicians, statesmen, law-makers and\r\nenforcers, who, at home or as representatives of the nation abroad, go\r\nto make up our political structure, and judges and lawyers.\r\n\r\nTo the world at large, which looks on and sees this giant institution\r\nmove through the ranks of business without noise or dissension and with\r\nthe ease and smoothness of a creature one-millionth its size, it would\r\nseem that there must be some wonderful and complicated code of rules to\r\nguide and control the thousands of lieutenants and privates who conduct\r\nits affairs. This is partially true, partially false. \"Standard Oil's\"\r\ngoverning rules are as rigid as the laws of the Medes and Persians, yet\r\nso simple as to be easily understood by any one.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a fundamental law, from which no one--neither the great\r\nnor the small--is exempt. In substance it is: \"Every 'Standard Oil' man\r\nmust wear the 'Standard Oil' collar.\"\r\n\r\nThis collar is riveted on to each one as he is taken into \"the band,\"\r\nand can only be removed with the head of the wearer.\r\n\r\nHere is the code. The penalty for infringing the following rules is\r\ninstant \"removal.\"\r\n\r\n     1. Keep your mouth closed, as silence is gold, and gold is\r\n     what we exist for.\r\n\r\n     2. Collect our debts to-day. Pay the other fellow's debts\r\n     to-morrow. To-day is always here, to-morrow may never come.\r\n\r\n     3. Conduct all our business so that the buyer and the seller\r\n     must come to us. Keep the seller waiting; the longer he\r\n     waits the less he'll take. Hurry the buyer, as his money\r\n     brings us interest.\r\n\r\n     4. Make all profitable bargains in the name of \"Standard\r\n     Oil,\" chancy ones in the names of dummies. \"Standard Oil\"\r\n     never goes back on a bargain.\r\n\r\n     5. Never put \"Standard Oil\" trades in writing, as your\r\n     memory and the other fellow's forgetfulness will always be\r\n     re-enforced with our organization. Never forget our Legal\r\n     Department is paid by the year, and our land is full of\r\n     courts and judges.\r\n\r\n     6. As competition is the life of trade--our trade, and\r\n     monopoly the death of trade--our competitor's trade, employ\r\n     both judiciously.\r\n\r\n     7. Never enter into a \"butting\" contest with the Government.\r\n     Our Government is by the people and for the people, and we\r\n     are the people, and those people who are not us can be hired\r\n     by us.\r\n\r\n     8. Always do \"right.\" Right makes might, might makes\r\n     dollars, dollars make right, and we have the dollars.\r\n\r\nAll business of the gigantic \"Standard Oil\" system is dealt with through\r\ntwo great departments. Mr. Rogers is head of the executive, and William\r\nRockefeller the head of the financial department. All new schemes,\r\nwhether suggested by outsiders or initiated within the institution, go\r\nto Mr. Rogers. Regardless of their nature or character, he first takes\r\nthem under advisement. If a scheme prove good enough to run the gantlet\r\nof Mr. Rogers' tremendously high standard, the promoter, after he has\r\nset forth his plans and estimates, hears with astonishment these words:\r\n\r\n\"Wait while I go upstairs. I'll say Yes or No upon my return.\"\r\n\r\nAnd upon his return it is almost always \"Yes.\" If the project, however,\r\ndoes not come up to his exacting requirements, it is turned down without\r\nfurther ado or consultation with any of his associates.\r\n\r\nThose intimate with affairs at 26 Broadway have grown curiously familiar\r\nwith this expression, \"I am going upstairs.\" \"Upstairs\" means two\r\ndistinct and separate things. When a matter in Mr. Rogers' department is\r\nawaiting his return from \"upstairs,\" it means he has gone to place the\r\nscheme before William Rockefeller, on the thirteenth floor, and laying a\r\nthing before William Rockefeller by Mr. Rogers consists of a brief,\r\nvigorous statement of Mr. Rogers' own conclusions and a request for his\r\nassociate's judgment of it. William Rockefeller's strong quality is his\r\nability to estimate quickly the practical value of a given scheme. His\r\napproval means he will finance it, and William Rockefeller's \"say-so\" is\r\nas absolute in the financing of things as is Mr. Rogers' in passing\r\nupon their feasibility. It does not matter whether it is an undertaking\r\ncalling for the employment of $50,000 capital or $50,000,000 or\r\n$500,000,000, Mr. Rockefeller's \"Yes\" or \"No\" is all there is to it. He\r\nhaving passed on it, Mr. Rogers supervises its execution.\r\n\r\nThe other \"upstairs\" is one that is heard every week-day of the year\r\nexcept summer Saturdays. At 26 Broadway, just before eleven o'clock each\r\nmorning, there is a flutter in the offices of all the leading heads of\r\ndepartments from Henry H. Rogers down, for going \"upstairs\" to the\r\neleven o'clock meeting is in the mind of each \"Standard Oil\" man the one\r\nall-important event of every working day.\r\n\r\nIn the big room, on the fifteenth floor, at 26 Broadway, there gather\r\neach day, between the hour of eleven and twelve o'clock, all the active\r\nmen whose efforts make \"Standard Oil\" what \"Standard Oil\" is; here also\r\ncome to meet and mingle with the active heads the retired captains when\r\n\"they are in town.\" Around a large table they sit. Reports are\r\npresented, views exchanged, policies talked over, republics and empires\r\nmade and unmade. If the Recorders in the next world have kept complete\r\nminutes of what has happened \"upstairs\" at 26 Broadway they must have\r\ntremendously large fire-proof safes. It is at the meeting \"upstairs\"\r\nthat the \"melons are cut,\" and if one of the retired captains were asked\r\nwhy he was in such a rush to be on hand each day when in town, and if he\r\nwere in a talkative mood--which he would not be--he would answer: \"They\r\nmay be cutting a new melon, and there's nothing like being on hand when\r\nthe juice runs out.\"\r\n\r\nIf a new melon has been cut--an Amalgamated Copper, for instance--it is\r\nat one of these meetings that the different \"Standard Oil\" men are\r\ninformed for the first time that the scheme, about which they may have\r\nread or heard much outside, is far enough along for them to participate\r\nin it. Each is told what sized slice he may have if he cares for any. It\r\nis a very exceptional thing for any one to ask for more than he has been\r\napportioned, and an unheard-of thing for any one to refuse to take his\r\nslice, although there is absolutely no compulsion in the connection.\r\n\r\nAnd here, perhaps, may not come amiss an incident which illustrates what\r\nmay happen in a few minutes \"upstairs.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Amalgamated was launched, in bringing together the different\r\nproperties of which it was composed I negotiated for the acquisition of\r\nthe Parrott mine, the majority of whose stock was held by certain old and\r\nwealthy brass manufacturers in Connecticut. They had never seen any of\r\nthe Rockefellers nor Henry H. Rogers, but we were several months getting\r\nthe deal into shape before it was finally arranged, and they became\r\nfamiliar with the great \"Standard Oil\" institution. So much so that the\r\nchief of the owners--to whom was delegated the duty of turning over the\r\nsecurities to my principals--looked forward with much eagerness to the\r\ntime when he must necessarily meet the mysterious and important\r\npersonages who guided 26 Broadway's destinies. Finally the day came, and\r\nat precisely a quarter of eleven I let him into one of the numerous\r\nprivate offices which are a part of Mr. Rogers' suite. He had under his\r\narm a bundle of papers representing the stocks which he was to exchange\r\nfor the purchase money, amounting to $4,086,000, and I think he fully\r\nexpected that in their examination, in the receipting for so large an\r\namount of money, and in the general talkings over, which he thought must\r\nof course be a necessary part of the delivery, the greater part of the\r\nday would be taken up. It took me some six or seven minutes to get him\r\nlocated, and it was close on to five minutes of eleven when Mr. Rogers\r\nstepped into the room. I was well into the introduction, when out came\r\nMr. Rogers' watch, and with what must have appeared to the visitor as\r\nastonished consternation.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope you will excuse me,\" he exclaimed in the middle of a\r\nhandshake, \"but, my gracious, I am overdue upstairs,\" and he bolted.\r\n\r\nHis place was taken fifty seconds after by Mr. Rogers' secretary, who in\r\nless than five minutes had exchanged a check of $4,086,000, made out to\r\nherself and indorsed in blank, for the bundle of stocks, and in another\r\nminute I was ushering the old gentleman into the elevator.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to on the sidewalk he got his breath sufficiently to say:\r\n\"Phew! I thought my trade was a big one, but that friend of yours,\r\nRogers, must have had some other fellow upstairs who was going to turn\r\nin $40,000,000 of stuff, because he did appear dreadfully excited!\"\r\n\r\nThe success of \"Standard Oil\" is largely due to two things--to the\r\nloyalty of its members to each other and to \"Standard Oil,\" and to the\r\npunishment of its enemies. Each member before initiation knows its\r\nreligion to be reward for friends and extermination for foes. Once\r\nwithin the magic circle, a man realizes he is getting all that any one\r\nelse on earth can afford to pay him for like services, and still more\r\nthrown in for full measure. Moreover, while a \"Standard Oil\" man's\r\nreward is always ample and satisfactory, he is constantly reminded in a\r\nthousand and one ways that punishment for disloyalty is sure and\r\nterrible, and that in no corner of the earth can he escape it, nor can\r\nany power on earth protect him from it.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Oil\" is never loud in its rewards nor its punishments. It does\r\nnot care for the public's praise nor for its condemnation, but endeavors\r\nto avoid both by keeping its \"business\" to itself. As an instance, in\r\nconnection with certain gas settlements I made with \"Standard Oil,\" it\r\nvoluntarily paid one of its agents for a few days' work $250,000. He had\r\nexpected at the outside $25,000. When I published the fact, as I had a\r\nright to, \"Standard Oil\" was mad as hornets--as upset, indeed, as though\r\nit had been detected in cheating the man out of two-thirds of his just\r\ndue, instead of having paid him ten times what was coming to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MEN IN POWER BEHIND THE \"SYSTEM\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the great Thing known to the world as \"Standard Oil,\" the most\r\nperfect embodiment of a \"system\" which I will endeavor to get before my\r\nreaders in later chapters, there are three heads, Henry H. Rogers,\r\nWilliam Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller. All the other members are\r\ndistinctively lieutenants, or subordinate workers, unless possibly I\r\nexcept James Stillman, who, from his peculiar connection with \"Standard\r\nOil\" and his individually independent position, should perhaps be placed\r\nin the category of heads.\r\n\r\nSome one has said: \"If you would know who is the head of a family, slip\r\ninto the home.\" The world, the big, arbitrary, hit-or-miss,\r\ntoo-much-in-a-hurry-to-correct-its-mistakes world, has decided that the\r\nmaster of \"Standard Oil\" is John D. Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller\r\nit is to all but those who have a pass-key to the \"Standard Oil\" home.\r\nTo those the head of \"Standard Oil\"--the \"Standard Oil\" the world knows\r\nas it knows St. Paul, Shakespeare, or Jack the Giant-killer, or any of\r\nthe things it knows well but not at all--is Henry H. Rogers. John D.\r\nRockefeller may have more money, more actual dollars, than Henry H.\r\nRogers, or all other members of the \"Standard Oil\" family, and in the\r\nearly days of \"Standard Oil\" may have been looked up to as the big gun\r\nby his partners, and allowed to take the hugest hunks of the profits,\r\nand may have so handled and judiciously invested these as to be at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century the richest man on earth, but none of\r\nthese things alters the fact that the big brain, the big body, the head\r\nof \"Standard Oil,\" is Henry H. Rogers.\r\n\r\nTake station at the entrance of 26 Broadway and watch the different\r\nmembers of the \"Standard Oil\" family as they enter the building: you\r\nwill exclaim once and only once: \"There goes the Master!\" And the man\r\nwho calls forth the cry will be Henry H. Rogers.\r\n\r\nThe big, jovial detective who stands all day long with one foot resting\r\non the sidewalk and one on the first stone step of the home of \"Standard\r\nOil\" will make oath he shows no different sign to Henry H. Rogers than\r\nto a Rockefeller, a Payne, a Flagler, a Pratt, or an O'Day; yet watch\r\nhim when Mr. Rogers passes up the steps--an unconscious deference marks\r\nhis salutation--the tribute of the soldier to the commanding general.\r\n\r\nFollow through the door bearing the sign, \"Henry H. Rogers, President of\r\nthe National Transit Co.,\" on the eleventh floor, and pass from the\r\nouter office into the beautiful, spacious mahogany apartment beyond,\r\nwith its decorations of bronze bulls and bears and yacht-models, its\r\nwalls covered with neatly framed autograph letters from Lincoln, Grant,\r\n\"Tom\" Reed, Mark Twain, and other real, big men, and it will come over\r\nyou like a flash that here, unmistakably, is the _sanctum sanctorum_ of\r\nthe mightiest business institution of modern times. If a single doubt\r\nlingers, read what the men in the frames have said to Henry H. Rogers,\r\nand you will have proof positive that these judges of human nature knew\r\nthis man, not only as the master of \"Standard Oil,\" but also as a sturdy\r\nand resolute friend whose jovial humanity they had recognized and\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nDid my readers ever hear of the National Transit Company? Very few\r\nhave--yet the presidency of it is the modest title of Henry H. Rogers.\r\nWhen the world is ladling out honors to the \"Standard Oil\" kings, and\r\nspouting of their wondrous riches, how often is Henry H. Rogers\r\nmentioned? Not often, for he is never where the public can get a glimpse\r\nof him--he is too busy pulling the wires and playing the buttons in the\r\nshadows just behind the throne. Had it not been that that divinity which\r\ndisposes of men's purposes compelled this man, as he neared the end of\r\nhis remarkable career, to come into the open on Amalgamated, he might\r\nnever have been known as the real master of \"Standard Oil.\" But if he is\r\nmissing when the public is hurrahing, he is sufficiently in evidence\r\nwhen clouds lower or when the danger-signal is run to the masthead at\r\n26 Broadway. He who reads \"Standard Oil\" history will note that, from\r\nits first deal until this day, whenever bricks, cabbages, or aged eggs\r\nwere being presented to \"Standard Oil,\" always were Henry H. Rogers'\r\ntowering form and defiant eye to be seen in the foreground where the\r\nmissiles flew thickest.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years, whenever the great political parties have\r\nlined-up for their regular once-in-four-years' tussle, there would be\r\nfound Henry H. Rogers, calm as a race-track gambler, \"sizing-up\" the\r\nentries, their weights and handicaps. Every twist and turn in the\r\npedigrees and records of Republicans and Democrats are as familiar to\r\nhim as the \"dope-sheets\" are to the gambler, for is he not at the\r\nreceiving end of the greatest information bureau in the world?\r\n\r\nA Standard Oil agent is in every hamlet in the country, and who better\r\nthan these trained and intelligent observers to interpret the varying\r\ntrends of feelings in their communities? Tabulated and analyzed, these\r\nreports enable Rogers, the sagacious politician, to diagnose the drift\r\nof the country far ahead of the most astute of campaign managers. He is\r\nnever in doubt about who will win the election. Before the contest is\r\nunder way he has picked his winner and is beside him with generous\r\noffers of war expenses.\r\n\r\nWhen labor would howl its anathemas at Standard Oil, and the\r\nRockefellers and other stout-hearted generals and captains of this band\r\nof merry money-makers would fall to discussing conciliation and retreat,\r\nit was always Henry H. Rogers who fired at his associates his now famous\r\npanacea for all Standard Oil opposition: \"We'll see Standard Oil in hell\r\nbefore we will allow any body of men on earth to dictate how we shall\r\nconduct our business!\" And the fact that \"Standard Oil\" still does its\r\nbusiness in the Elysian fields of success, where is neither sulphur nor\r\nthe fumes of sulphur, is additional evidence of whose will it is that\r\nsways its destinies.\r\n\r\nAn impression of the despotic character of the man and of his manner of\r\ndespatching the infinite details of the multitudinous business he must\r\ndeal with daily may be gained by a glimpse of Henry H. Rogers at one of\r\nthe meetings of the long list of giant corporations which number him\r\namong their directors. Surrounded though he be by the élite of all\r\nfinancialdom, the very flower of the business brains of America, you\r\nwill surely hear his sharp, incisive, steel-clicking: \"Gentlemen, are we\r\nready for the vote, for I regret to say, I have another important and\r\nunavoidable meeting at ----?\" You look at your watch. The time he\r\nmentions is twelve, or, at the most, fifteen minutes away. There is no\r\nchance for further discussion. Cut-and-dried resolutions are promptly\r\nput to the vote, and off goes the master to his other engagement which\r\nwill be disposed of in the same peremptory fashion.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the directors of \"financed\" Steel, during the brief\r\nreign of its late \"vacuumized\" president, Charlie Schwab, an episode\r\noccurred which exhibited the danger of interfering with Mr. Rogers'\r\niron-bound plans. The fact that the steel throne was many sizes too\r\nlarge for Schwab had, about this time, become publicly notorious, but\r\nCarnegie and Morgan on the surface, and \"Standard Oil\" beneath, were so\r\nbusy preparing their alibis against the crash which even then was\r\noverdue that they had neither time nor desire to adjust themselves on\r\nthe seat.\r\n\r\nIn advance Mr. Rogers made his invariable plea for quick action on a\r\nmatter before the board when Schwab, with a tact generated by the\r\nwabbling of a misfit Wall Street crown chafing a generous pair of ears,\r\nblurted out: \"Mr. Rogers will vote on this question after we have talked\r\non it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a voice that those who heard it say sounded like a rattlesnake's hiss\r\nin a refrigerator, Rogers replied: \"All meetings where I sit as director\r\nvote first and talk after I am gone.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said, and from my knowledge of these and after-events I believe\r\nwith truth, that this occurrence was the spark that started the terrific\r\nexplosion in United States Steel, for not long afterward some unknown\r\nand mysterious power began that formidable attack on Steel stock which\r\nleft Wall Street full of the unattached ears, eyes, noses, breastbones,\r\nand scalps of hordes of financial potentates and their flambeau\r\ncarriers. Whether or not Mr. Rogers was the instigator of this movement\r\nno man, of course, can positively state, but I can vouch for the fact\r\nthat about this time he displayed, when talking \"Steel\" affairs with\r\nintimates, a most contemptuous bitterness against \"King Charlie\" and\r\ncertain of his associates.\r\n\r\nAt sixty-five Henry H. Rogers is probably one of the most\r\ndistinguished-looking men of the time; tall and straight, and as\r\nwell-proportioned and supple as one of the beautiful American elms which\r\nline the streets of his native town. He was born in Fairhaven, a fishing\r\nvillage just over the bridge from the great whaling port, New Bedford.\r\nHe comes of stalwart New England stock; his father was a sea-captain,\r\nand his lot, like that of most of the sons of old New England seaport\r\ntowns, was cast along those hard, brain-and-body-developing lines which,\r\nbeginning in the red village school-house, the white meeting-house, and\r\nthe yellowish-grayish country store, end in unexpected places, often, as\r\nin this instance, upon the golden throne of business royalty.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers' part in the very early days of Standard Oil was that of\r\nclerk and bookkeeper. He makes no secret that when he had risen to the\r\nheight of $8 a week wages he felt as proud and confident as ever in\r\nafter-life when for the same number of days' labor it was no uncommon\r\noccurrence to find himself credited with a hundred thousand times that\r\namount.\r\n\r\nAll able men have some of God's indelible imprints of greatness. This\r\nman's every feature bespeaks strength and distinction. When he walks,\r\nthe active swing of his figure expresses power--realized, confident\r\npower. When at rest or in action his square jaw tells of fighting power,\r\nbull-dog, hold-on, never-let-go fighting power, and his high, full\r\nforehead of intellectual, mightily intellectual power; and they are\r\nre-enforced with cheek-bones and nose which suggest that this fighting\r\npower has in it something of the grim ruthlessness of the North American\r\nIndian. The eyes, however, are the crowning characteristic of the man's\r\nphysical make-up.\r\n\r\nOne must see Mr. Rogers' eyes in action and in repose to half appreciate\r\ntheir wonders. I can only say they are red, blue, and black, brown,\r\ngray, and green; nor do I want my readers to think I put in colors that\r\nare not there, for there must be many others than those I have\r\nmentioned. I have seen them when they were so restfully blue that I\r\nwould think they never could be anything but a part of those skies that\r\ncome with the August and September afternoons when the bees' hum and the\r\nlocusts' drone blend with the smell of the new-mown hay to help spell\r\nthe word \"Rest.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen them so green that within their depths I was almost sure the\r\nfish were lazily resting in the shadows of those sea-plants which grow\r\nonly on the ocean's bottom; and I have seen them as black as that\r\nthunder-cloud which makes us wonder: \"Is He angry?\" And then again I\r\nhave watched them when they were of that fiery red and that glinting\r\nyellow which one sees only when at night the doors of a great, roaring\r\nfurnace are opened.\r\n\r\nThere is such a kindly good-will in these eyes when they are at rest\r\nthat the man does not live who would not consider himself favored to be\r\nallowed to turn over to Henry H. Rogers his pocket-book without\r\nreceiving a receipt. They are the eyes of the man you would name in your\r\nwill to care for your wife's and children's welfare. When their\r\nanimation is friendly one would rather watch their merry twinkle as they\r\nkeep time to their owner's inimitable stories and non-duplicatable\r\nanecdotes, trying to interpret the rapid and incessant telegraphy of\r\ntheir glances, than sit in a theatre or read an interesting book; but it\r\nis when they are active in war that the one privileged to observe them\r\ngets his real treat, always provided he can dodge the rain of blazing\r\nsparks and the withering hail of wrath that pours out on the offender.\r\nTo watch them then requires real nerve, for it is only a nimble,\r\nstout-hearted, mail-covered individual that can sustain the encounter.\r\n\r\nI have seen many forms of human wrath, many men transformed to terrible\r\nthings by anger, but I have never seen any that were other than\r\njumping-jack imitations of a jungle tiger compared with Henry H. Rogers\r\nwhen he \"lets 'er go\"--when the instant comes that he realizes some one\r\nis balking the accomplishment of his will.\r\n\r\nAbove all things Henry H. Rogers is a great actor. Had his lot been\r\ncast upon the stage, he might easily have eclipsed the fame of Booth or\r\nSalvini. He knows the human animal from the soles of his feet to the\r\npart in his hair and from his shoulder-blade to his breastbone, and like\r\nall great actors is not above getting down to every part he plays. He is\r\nlikely also so to lose himself in a rôle that he gives it his own force\r\nand identity, and then things happen quite at variance with the lines.\r\nThe original Booth would come upon the stage the cool, calculating,\r\npolished actor, but when well into his part was so lost in it that it\r\nwas often with difficulty he could be brought back to himself when the\r\ncurtain fell. Once while playing Richard III. at the old Boston Museum,\r\nRichmond, by whom he was to be slain, made, at the ordained moment, the\r\nthrust which should have laid him low, but instead, Booth in high frenzy\r\nparried it, and with the fiendishness of the original Richard, step by\r\nstep drove Richmond off the stage and through the wings, and it was not\r\nuntil the police seized the great tragedian, two blocks away, that the\r\nterrified duke, who had dropped his sword and was running for dear life,\r\nwas sure he would ever act again.\r\n\r\nWhen in the midst of his important plays, it is doubtful whether Henry\r\nH. Rogers realizes until the guardians of the peace appear where the\r\nacting begins and the reality should end. His intimate associates can\r\nrecall many times when his determination to make a hit in his part has\r\ncaused other actors cast with him to throw aside their dummy swords and\r\nrun for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe entire history of \"Standard Oil\" is strewn with court-scenes, civil\r\nand criminal, and in all the important ones Henry H. Rogers, the actor,\r\nwill be found doing marvellous \"stunts.\" Standard Oil historians are\r\nfond of dwelling on the extraordinary testifying abilities of John D.\r\nRockefeller and other members of the band, but the acrobatic feats of\r\nground and lofty tumbling in the way of truth which they have given when\r\nbefore the blinking footlights of the temples of justice are as\r\nPunch-and-Judy shows to a Barnum three-ring circus compared to Henry H.\r\nRogers' exhibitions.\r\n\r\nHis \"I will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\r\nso help me God,\" sounds absolutely sincere and honest, but as it rings\r\nout in the tone of the third solemnest bell in the chime, this is how it\r\nis taken down in the unerring short-hand notes of the recording angel\r\nand sent by special wireless to the typewriter for His Majesty of the\r\nSulphur Trust: \"What I tell _shall_ be the truth and the whole truth,\r\nand there _shall be_ no truth but that I tell, and God help the man or\r\nwoman who tells truth different from my truth.\" The recording angel\r\nnever missed catching Henry H. Rogers' court-oaths in this way, and\r\nnever missed sending them along to the typewriter at Sulphurville, with\r\nthis postscript: \"Keep your wire open, for there'll be things doing\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nAt the recent but now famous sensational Boston \"Gas Trial,\" Henry H.\r\nRogers in the rôle of defendant was the principal witness. I was in\r\ncourt five hours and a half each sitting as day after day he testified.\r\nI watched, as the brightest lawyers in the land laid their traps for him\r\nin direct and cross-examination, to detect a single sign of fiction\r\nreplacing truth, or going joint-account with her, or where truth parted\r\ncompany with fiction; and I was compelled, when he stepped from the\r\nwitness-stand, to admit I had not found what I had watched for. This,\r\ntoo, when I was equipped with actual knowledge and black-and-white\r\nproofs of the facts. Weeks before the trial began Attorney Sherman L.\r\nWhipple, one of the great cross-examiners of the time, had made his\r\nboast that he would break through the \"Standard Oil\" magnate's\r\nheretofore impenetrable bulwarks, and when H. H. Rogers entered the\r\ncourt-room for the first time and let his eagle eye sweep the lawyers,\r\nthe laymen, and the judge until it finally rested on Whipple, the glance\r\nwas as absolute a challenge and a defiance as ever knights of old\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nI followed Mr. Rogers on the witness-stand and was compelled to give\r\ntestimony directly opposite to that which he had given, and at one time,\r\nas I glanced at the row of lawyers who were in \"Standard Oil's\" hire, I\r\nfelt a cold perspiration start at every pore at the thought of what\r\nwould happen if I even in a slight detail got mixed in my facts. Then I\r\nfully realized the magnificence of Mr. Rogers' acting, for not once in\r\nall the hours I had sat and watched him had I detected a single evidence\r\nof cold, hot, or lukewarm perspiration coming from his pores.\r\n\r\nYet away from the intoxicating spell of dollar-making this remarkable\r\nman is one of the most charming and lovable beings I have ever\r\nencountered, a man whom any man or woman would be proud to have for a\r\nbrother; a man whom any mother or father would give thanks for as a son;\r\na man whom any woman would be happy to know as her husband, and a man\r\nwhom any boy or girl would rejoice to call father. Once he passes under\r\nthe baleful influence of \"The Machine,\" however, he becomes a\r\nrelentless, ravenous creature, pitiless as a shark, knowing no law of\r\nGod or man in the execution of his purpose. Between him and coveted\r\ndollars may come no kindly, humane influences--all are thrust aside,\r\ntheir claims disregarded, in ministering to this strange, cannibalistic\r\nmoney-hunger, which, in truth, grows by what it feeds on.\r\n\r\nIn describing one head of \"Standard Oil,\" I have necessarily used many\r\nwords because nature cast him in a most uncommon and chameleon-like\r\nmould. The other two require less of my space, for neither is unusual\r\nnor remarkable.\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller, however great his ability or worldly success, can\r\nbe fully described as a man made in the image of an ideal money-maker\r\nand an ideal money-maker made in the image of a man. A foot-note should\r\ncall attention to the fact that an ideal money-maker is a machine the\r\ndetails of which are diagrammed in the asbestos blue-prints which paper\r\nthe walls of Hell.\r\n\r\nWith William Rockefeller it is different. When I read in my Bible that\r\nGod made man in His own image and likeness, I find myself picturing a\r\ncertain type of individual--a solid, substantial, sturdy gentleman with\r\nthe broad shoulders and strong frame of an Englishman, and a cautious,\r\nkindly expression of face. And that is the most fitting description I\r\ncan give of William Rockefeller. A man of few, very few words and most\r\nexcellent judgment--rather brotherly than friendly, clean of mind and\r\nbody; and if I have not given you the impression of a good, wholesome\r\nman made in the image of his God, I have done William Rockefeller a\r\ngreater wrong than an honest man can afford to do another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMY OWN RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to my personal responsibility for the crime of Amalgamated, right\r\nhere, before proceeding further, I shall briefly explain the\r\ntransaction, state my share in the deal, and point out how completely I\r\nwas hoodwinked by the \"System.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Anaconda mine and affiliated properties, previous to the\r\ncreation of the Amalgamated, were owned by J. B. Haggin, Lloyd Tevis,\r\nand Marcus Daly. The control of the properties and their operations were\r\nabsolutely vested in Marcus Daly, and he alone knew where the lean veins\r\nended and the fat ones began. For many years he had kept a close guard\r\nover the very fat ones, never letting his right eye know what the left\r\none saw when he was examining them. For deep down in his mind Marcus\r\nDaly cherished a dream--a dream of immense riches, and it was to be\r\nrealized in a simple enough way. He would get together the millions to\r\nbuy out his partners on the basis of a valuation of the \"ore in sight,\"\r\nthen in supreme ownership himself reap untold profits out of the milling\r\nof the plethoric veins he had been so careful to leave unworked. The\r\nimmense natural endowments of the Anaconda rendered this easy enough,\r\nfor even the lean veins \"in sight\" contained a vast store of copper and\r\ngold and silver.\r\n\r\nJust about the time the world awaited the first section of \"Coppers\"\r\nwhich I had advertised should consist of the rich Boston & Montana, and\r\nButte & Boston properties, it \"happened\" that Mr. Rogers \"met\" Marcus\r\nDaly. The result of the conjunction of the two personalities--the\r\nwhole-souled, trusting miner and the fascinating and persuasive master\r\nof Standard Oil--was decisive; the miner confided his dreams and his\r\naspirations to the magnate, who at once magnificently undertook to\r\nrealize them. The trade was almost instantly made. Mr. Rogers would buy\r\nthe properties of Daly, Haggin, and Tevis, at \"in-sight\" prices, and\r\nDaly would be his partner, but the partnership must remain secret until\r\nthe purchase was consummated.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the Anaconda Company at the time consisted of 1,200,000\r\nshares, and the purchase of a few shares over the majority at the\r\n\"in-sight\" lean-vein valuation of $24,000,000 would carry the turnover\r\nof the management and the control. It took but a very brief time to get\r\ntogether the other properties which were finally included in the first\r\nsection of Amalgamated. They consisted of the Colorado, Washoe, and\r\nParrott Mining companies and timber, coal, and other lands, and\r\nmercantile and like properties situated in the State of Montana, for\r\nwhich Mr. Rogers paid in round figures $15,000,000, _a total of\r\n$39,000,000 for what within a few days after purchase was capitalized at\r\n$75,000,000 in the Amalgamated Company_.\r\n\r\nNo one but Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller, myself, and one lawyer\r\nknew the actual figures of the cost, although a number of the members of\r\nthe different groups, including Marcus Daly, the silent partner, were\r\nsure they were in the secret.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the properties were secured, they were capitalized for\r\n$75,000,000 as the Amalgamated Copper Company and were immediately\r\noffered for sale to the public. It will thus be seen that the profit on\r\nthis section alone was $36,000,000, probably the largest actual profit\r\never made by one body of men in a single corporation deal, yet so nicely\r\ndoes \"Standard Oil\" discriminate in dispensing its generosity that in\r\nthis case those who received the $36,000,000 profit refused to deduct\r\nfrom it $77,000 of expenses connected with the formation of the company,\r\nthereby compelling it to start $77,000 in debt. This was something\r\nMarcus Daly never forgave and to the day of his death he repeatedly\r\nreferred to the act as the personification of corporation meanness.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the Amalgamated Corporation certain individuals\r\nand institutions, for various considerations, were entitled to some\r\nshare in the profits of the deal. First there was Marcus Daly who knew\r\nwhat the major portion of the property had cost and was a silent partner\r\nin the winnings as he knew them. The Amalgamated Company was organized\r\nin and floated on the public from the National City Bank, and so James\r\nStillman, its president and head, who is also one of the inner circle of\r\n\"Standard Oil\" chiefs, should participate. Something was due also to J.\r\nPierpont Morgan & Co., and to Frederick Olcott, president of the Central\r\nTrust Company of New York, who were on the board of directors. On the\r\nboard of directors, too, was Governor Flower, of the banking and\r\nbrokerage house of Flower & Co., who had acted as fiscal agents for the\r\ncorporation at its formation. Nor must I forget the Lewisohn Brothers,\r\nwho had been compelled to turn in all their copper business at a\r\nfraction of its worth--or at just the aggregate of its cost and raw\r\nmaterial--to be incorporated in the United Metals Selling Company, a\r\npart of the Amalgamated scheme, but not included in the corporation.\r\nEvery one of these men had elaborate assurances that he was in on the\r\ncellar floor.\r\n\r\nThis is what actually occurred. Before Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller let any one at all in, they built a superbly designed\r\nwater-, air-, and light-proof structure (particularly light-proof),\r\nconsisting of five floors, each one being the exact duplicate of the\r\n$39,000,000 one upon which they, and they only, stood. Marcus Daly alone\r\nwas ushered in on the first floor, elevated just a few million dollars\r\nabove their own. James Stillman and Leonard Lewisohn, of Lewisohn\r\nBrothers, were admitted to the next one, the $50,000,000 floor. In other\r\nwords, Mr. Stillman and Mr. Lewisohn were given an unnamed percentage,\r\nthe percentage to be arranged later by Mr. Rogers, in all profits above\r\nactual cost, and such actual cost was called $50,000,000 and was arrived\r\nat by adding the $11,000,000 of secret profits to the actual $39,000,000\r\ncost. Then J. P. Morgan & Co., Frederick Olcott, Governor Flower, and\r\none or two of the dearest friends and closest associates, were let in on\r\nthe $60,000,000 floor--were given an unnamed percentage, the percentage\r\nto be arranged by Mr. Rogers, in all profits above actual cost, and such\r\nactual cost was called $60,000,000, and was arrived at by adding\r\n$21,000,000 of secret profits to the actual $39,000,000 cost. Then\r\nselected ones from the eight different groups of \"Standard Oil\" were\r\nallowed to move in to the fifth, or underwriters' floor, which was\r\naffirmed to be $70,000,000 cost; and then, as a solid phalanx, all the\r\ndifferent floor-dwellers marched upon the dear public to the tune of\r\n$75,000,000, in the front ranks of which were those of the eight groups\r\nof the Standard Oil army who had not already been admitted to any of the\r\nsecret floors.\r\n\r\nRight here the crime of Amalgamated was born, not so much the legal\r\ncrime but the great moral crime. In the ethics of Wall Street the\r\nheinousness of the transaction lies not in the fact that the public was\r\ncompelled to pay $36,000,000 profit to a few men who had invested but\r\n$39,000,000--and, as I shall show when I approach this part of my story,\r\nthe $39,000,000 did not even belong to them--but in the fact that Mr.\r\nRogers and Mr. Rockefeller had given to their associates what, in the\r\nvernacular of \"the Street,\" is termed \"the double cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe every-day people, the millions who do not know Wall Street, realm of\r\nthe royal American dollar; Wall Street, its sidewalks inlaid with gold\r\ncoin and paved from curb to curb with solid gold bricks; Wall Street,\r\nlined with huge money-mills where hearts and souls are ground into\r\ngold-dust, whose gutters run full to overflowing with strangled,\r\nmangled, sand-bagged wrecks of human hopes, to be poured, in a\r\nnever-ending stream, into the brimming waters of the river at its foot,\r\nfor deposit at the poor-houses, insane asylums, States' prisons, and\r\nsuicides' graves, washed daily by that grim flood's ebb and flow--the\r\nevery-day people, I am sure, will not take in the blackness of this\r\ntransaction at this stage of my story, but before it is ended I will lay\r\nthis and many more of an equally hellish nature before them in such A B\r\nC simplicity that all can read the portent as clearly as the Prophet\r\nDaniel read the writing on the wall in the banquet-hall of Belshazzar.\r\n\r\nWhen I consented to allow property which had cost only $39,000,000 to be\r\nsold to the public for $75,000,000, it was under a pressure which it was\r\npractically impossible for me to withstand. I do not think I use too\r\nstrong a word when I say \"pressure.\" For three years I had been\r\nadvertising to the world the great merits of \"Coppers,\" and for over a\r\nyear I had announced that when the public was given an opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the consolidated \"Coppers\" it would be upon a basis most\r\ncarefully worked out: that the properties included in the first section\r\nwould surely be worth more than the price at which they would be offered\r\nto the public, and that all the power, capital, and ability of \"Standard\r\nOil\" were behind the promises I made. I did this advertising openly and\r\nin the frankest possible way, and in all of my announcements, whether\r\nprinted, oral, or otherwise, used the names of Henry H. Rogers, William\r\nRockefeller, James Stillman, the National City Bank of New York, and\r\n\"Standard Oil\" as freely as I did my own, and in many ways led the\r\npublic to believe that the very rich Boston & Montana and Butte & Boston\r\ncompanies were to be included in this section of \"Coppers.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time my alliance with \"Standard Oil\" was close. A business\r\nconnection had developed into a strong personal relation between Mr.\r\nRogers and myself. We were engaged, together with William Rockefeller,\r\non a great financial deal which was based on certain conclusions I had\r\nworked out in regard to the copper industry. These men were to me the\r\nembodiment of success, success won in the fiercest commercial conflict\r\nof the age. Their position at the helm of the greatest financial\r\ninstitution in the world gave weight and importance to their judgment\r\nand opinions. Nor had aught occurred between us to suggest they would\r\ndare perpetrate the crimes they did. Besides all this, indeed an\r\nintegral part of it, my personal resources were completely involved in\r\nthe transaction, for the most part pledged with Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller in stocks of the Butte & Boston and Boston & Montana\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThis was, then, the nature of our connection when Mr. Rogers, suddenly\r\nand without previous intimation of his schemes, notified me of his\r\npurchase of the Daly-Haggin-Tevis properties, and practically ordered me\r\nto put them upon the tray which I was preparing and take them to the\r\neagerly waiting public, who by this time were fairly howling for the\r\ngood things we had been promising them.\r\n\r\nIn support of this extraordinary change of plan Mr. Rogers urged the\r\nsecret wealth of the Anaconda and the great value of the other\r\nproperties which I myself had helped purchase, but I bitterly opposed\r\nthe new proposition until there was nothing before me but these\r\nalternatives--to accept the change Mr. Rogers insisted on or break with\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" The latter would mean that I must announce to the public\r\nthat it was in danger of being tricked, and it was by no means certain\r\nthat my warning would carry weight against the denials and assurances of\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" However much influence I had obtained through my long\r\nyears of dealings with the public, independent of \"Standard Oil,\" I\r\nrealized that \"Standard Oil's\" influence and prestige were much greater,\r\nfor it must be remembered that at this time the public had not had the\r\nevidence since acquired of the \"System's\" cold-blooded trickery. If I\r\ntook this course it would mean not only my own ruin financially, for Mr.\r\nRogers and William Rockefeller could call my loans and wipe me out\r\ncompletely, but also the ruin of my friends and allies, who, under my\r\ndirection, had invested their own millions in the properties concerned.\r\nOn the other hand, I had the most earnest assurances from Mr. Rogers and\r\nWilliam Rockefeller that the new properties were worth much more than\r\nthe $75,000,000 at which it was proposed to capitalize them. They took\r\nme to task for my distrust of them, and went far to demonstrate to me\r\nthe accuracy of their estimates. They not only gave me Marcus Daly's\r\nminute estimates of the values and legitimate possibilities of Anaconda,\r\nbut consented to have these verified by outside experts in whom I had\r\nimplicit confidence, and whose personal examination more than bore out\r\nDaly's appraisal. I have never yet had reason to doubt the correctness\r\nof the figures then shown me, although since I began this story\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" in an endeavor to get me to abandon my efforts to\r\nsecure justice for the thousands I assisted in duping, have stated for\r\nthe first time that Marcus Daly deceived them and really, to use the\r\nwords of their chief counsel, sold them a \"gold brick.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this examination I felt convinced that the properties \"Standard\r\nOil\" insisted on substituting for those originally intended for the\r\nfirst section of Amalgamated were such that the public, if honestly\r\ndealt with, could not possibly meet with loss in purchasing. But even\r\nthen I only consented to go ahead with the flotation under a definite\r\nagreement which seemed to me completely to guard against all\r\ncontingencies of jugglery or deception. This agreement stipulated that\r\nall the profits from the transaction should be taken by those to whom\r\nthey were due in the stock of the Amalgamated Company, and no part of\r\nthem in cash--that the public should be sold, at the flotation, only\r\n$5,000,000 of the $75,000,000, and that \"Standard Oil\" and all\r\nassociated with \"Standard Oil\" in the profits should retain the\r\nremaining $70,000,000 until such time as it had been absolutely\r\ndemonstrated to the public that the property behind the $75,000,000 of\r\nstock was worth more than the amount it had been capitalized for.\r\nFurthermore, I was also promised that the $5,000,000 cash to be taken\r\nfrom the public should be kept intact, and in my handling of the market\r\nit should always be available for the repurchase from the investors of\r\nwhat had been sold to them, at the price which they had paid for it.\r\n\r\nThis was the basis on which I went on with Amalgamated. I would not have\r\nmy readers understand me as asserting it would have been possible for me\r\nto have stopped the flotation had I attempted it. But, on the other\r\nhand, I would not have them think that I desire to be absolved from the\r\ndisastrous results of the great mistake I made at this time in not at\r\nany cost doing that which after-happenings have shown would have been\r\nthe most honest course for me to have pursued. Nor would I have them\r\nthink I desire to be absolved from the consequences of many other\r\nmistakes which this one led me into--mistakes in temporizing with the\r\nsituation and postponing action which I should have boldly and\r\nfearlessly forced, regardless of all consequences to the public, my\r\nfriends, and myself.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent proceedings, the manner in which Amalgamated was actually\r\nsold to the public, the flagrant disregard of the conditions of my\r\nagreement with Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller, will, when fully told\r\nin their proper place in my story, show that the \"System,\" by whose\r\nmethods the public is as ruthlessly plundered as though the fruits of\r\nits labors were taken away from it by highwaymen, admits also of its own\r\nvotaries being tricked and despoiled by their associates. The men who\r\nparticipated in the transaction I have just described are among the most\r\nastute financiers in the country and presumably possessed of invincible\r\ncapacity to protect their own interests. But with all their knowledge of\r\nthe \"System's\" tricks they were, in this instance, as shrewdly duped as\r\nthe veriest tyro in the Wall Street game.\r\n\r\nMy own experience with the \"System\" in this deal was different in degree\r\nbut not in principle from that of these others, and it must be remembered\r\nthat I was better equipped to protect my interests than any of them. I knew\r\nthat the actual cost of the properties comprising the first Amalgamated was\r\n$39,000,000, and that when sold to the public at $75,000,000 there must be\r\na profit of $36,000,000. I had every right to think I knew all the other\r\ndetails connected with the transaction, for as organizer and executant of\r\nthe deal my share in the profits was to be equal to that of Henry H. Rogers\r\nand William Rockefeller respectively. We were each to have twenty-five per\r\ncent., the remaining twenty-five per cent. going to others. This was no\r\ngentleman's \"leave-it-to-me-and-I'll-see-you-get-what's-coming-to-you\"\r\narrangement either, but a hard, cold, mutually satisfactory and\r\nsettled-in-advance agreement. But when it came to the final accounting, the\r\n\"System\" had so regulated things that the participants on the various\r\nfloors, except, of course, Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller, must each\r\naccept without question the share finally handed over to him. Having no\r\nmeans of knowing how large the other interests were, or what the\r\n\"extraordinary expenses\" had been, they were in no position to question the\r\npayments made them, which represented sums below what they would have had\r\nif the business had been conducted as they thought it had been. When my\r\nfinal account was presented to me I was startled. Notwithstanding the\r\n\"cleverness\" of the \"System,\" the deception was so obvious, so audacious,\r\nthat the instant Mr. Rogers submitted it to me I exploded and denounced the\r\ntransaction with such vehemence and conviction that within a few minutes\r\nthere was forthcoming a second statement, revising the account, by which I\r\nwas given just double the amount first tendered, and the figures in both\r\naccounts ran into millions; yet the amount in the second account upon which\r\nI settled was only one-half the share received by my equal partners, Henry\r\nH. Rogers and William Rockefeller, as I afterward learned.[1]\r\n\r\nThis is a fair statement of my own share in the first Amalgamated\r\ntransaction. I have no desire to evade the issues suggested and raised\r\nby these revelations. My frankness should be absolute proof of that. As\r\nI promised, I shall hew to the exact line of fact, letting the chips of\r\nresponsibility, legal and moral, fall where they may, though many of\r\nthem stick to my own clothes. My own burden of error I am ready and\r\nwilling to shoulder, but I decline any longer to take and carry\r\nresponsibilities which belong absolutely to others. There should be a\r\ntime-limit on martyrdom, and mine anyhow is up.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I know no better spot in my story than right here to set the public\r\nright on two vital points concerning Amalgamated, upon which they are and\r\nalways have been greatly at sea:\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller did not have before the Amalgamated Company was\r\norganized and floated, nor at its organization and flotation, directly or\r\nindirectly, a dollar's interest in its stock nor its affairs, and I have\r\nwhat I consider excellent reasons for believing he has not had any interest\r\nup to the time of this writing.\r\n\r\nThe disasters which have come to the Amalgamated stockholders did not\r\noccur, as has been so industriously and ingeniously advertised throughout\r\nthe world, because of the inability of the \"Standard Oil\"-Amalgamated-City\r\nBank fraternity to prevent the collapse of the price of copper, the metal,\r\nfrom the high price of seventeen cents to the low one of eleven cents per\r\npound. \"Cornering\" the metal market, forcing the price to an abnormally\r\nhigh figure and maintaining it there had, notwithstanding the many emphatic\r\nstatements to the contrary, absolutely no part in any of our original\r\nplans, and the success or failure of our project was in no way dependent\r\nupon any price for copper, the metal, other than the fair and legitimate\r\nprice caused by legitimate supply and demand. In fact, as I shall\r\ndemonstrate before my story is ended, forcing the price to extremely high\r\npoints and the resulting collapse were all a part of the trickery by which\r\nthe public was plundered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF DOLLARS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt no time in the history of the United States has the power of dollars\r\nbeen as great as now. Freedom and equity are controlled by dollars. The\r\nlaws which should preserve and enforce all rights are made and enforced\r\nby dollars. It is possible to-day, with dollars, to \"steer\" the\r\nselection of the candidates of both the great parties for the highest\r\noffice in our republic, that of President of the United States. It is\r\npossible to repeat the operation in the selection of candidates for the\r\nexecutive and legislative conduct and control of every State and\r\nmunicipality in the United States, and with a sufficient number of\r\ndollars to \"steer\" the doings of the law-makers and law-enforcers of the\r\nnational, State, and municipal governments of the people, and to \"steer\"\r\na sufficient proportion of the court decisions to make absolute any\r\npower created by such direction. It is all, broadly speaking, a matter\r\nof dollars practically to accomplish these things. I must not be\r\nmisunderstood as even insinuating that there are not absolutely honest\r\nlaw-makers and law-enforcers, nor that there are not as many of them in\r\nproportion to the whole body as there were at the creation of our\r\nrepublic. I believe there is at the present time as large a percentage\r\nof honesty among Americans as ever there has been, but it is plainly\r\nevident to any student of the times that at no other period in the\r\nhistory of the United States has honesty been so completely \"steered\" by\r\ndishonesty as at this, the beginning of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n_I shall go further and say that there to-day exists uncontrolled in the\r\nhands of a set of men a power to make dollars from nothing._ That\r\nfunction of dollar-making which the people believe is vested in their\r\nGovernment alone and only exercised under the law for their benefit, is\r\nactually being secretly exercised on an enormous scale by a few private\r\nindividuals for their own personal benefit. This, I am well aware, is a\r\nstartling statement, but not more so than the facts which support it.\r\nThroughout the country we have all grown accustomed to the spectacle of\r\nmen who, poor yesterday, to-day display more dollars than the kings and\r\nqueens of olden times controlled. In flaunting this money these men\r\nproudly boast: \"We made all this yesternight, and are going to multiply\r\nit five-or fifty-fold to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that there must be in this country some secret method of\r\ngaining vast fortunes gradually dawned on the minds of the people. This\r\nmethod, they argued, must be outside the laws of the land which they\r\nthemselves had made, and they were confronted with the fact that the\r\npossessors of these fabulous fortunes were creating a power not\r\nrecognized by their Government and which practically placed the\r\nGovernment in the hands of the fortune-owners. They realized that in\r\nsome way the magic of this fortune-making was connected with, or seemed\r\nto be compounded in, institutions called corporations and trusts, and\r\nthat among these the head and centre was a great affair called \"Standard\r\nOil.\" Wherever this \"Standard Oil\" was, all knew that strange wonders\r\nwere worked. Within the sphere of its influence dirt changed to gold,\r\nliquids to solids, and what was, was not, and what was not, was. Whoever\r\nbecame a part of this mysterious \"Standard Oil,\" at the same time was\r\nrendered \"powerful\"; as though touched by a fairy's wand, he changed\r\nfrom pauper to millionaire. But what was \"Standard Oil\"? The people knew\r\nthat at the beginning it was only an aggregation of men, private\r\nindividuals, who had accumulated much money by securing a monopoly of\r\nselling oil, and that these men were \"Rockefellers,\" and that Standard\r\nOil and \"Rockefellers\" had been cute and cunning in the conduct of their\r\noil-selling to a degree greater than had been rival sellers of oil or of\r\nother necessities. And as time wore on much more was heard of the\r\ncleverness of Standard Oil and \"Rockefellers,\" as the victims of the\r\ncuteness and the cunning \"hollered\" in public places, and the\r\nnewspapers and writers of books exclaimed against their practices and\r\nexactions. But many other things were happening simultaneously, and to\r\nthe great bulk of the people it was interesting rather than portentous\r\nthat there existed in the country a giant oil-thing whose owners were\r\nreputed the richest men in the world.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that the monster\r\n\"Standard Oil\" loomed up before the people as the giant of all corporate\r\nthings and that its ominous shadow seemed to dwarf all other\r\ninstitutions, public or private. In multitudinous forms it was before\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn awed whispers men talked of its mysterious doings and canvassed its\r\nextraordinary powers as though \"Standard Oil\" were a living, breathing\r\nentity rather than a mere business institution created by men and\r\nexisting only by virtue of the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the world had begun mistily to take in the\r\ntremendous forces which radiated from \"Standard Oil,\" there occurred a\r\nfinancial crash, and the people saw their savings, invested in what they\r\nsupposed were the legal and absolute titles of ownership in the material\r\nthings of their country, suddenly decline in value and contract to\r\nprices representing a loss to them of billions of dollars. Throughout\r\nthe misery and suffering this terrible collapse occasioned, \"Standard\r\nOil\" remained undisturbed as before and amid all the confusion kept\r\nsternly on its dollar-\"making\" way. Indeed, it seemed to gain in bulk as\r\nother institutions diminished or disappeared. Then it was that the\r\npeople first began to demand, what they are still to-day fiercely\r\ndemanding, \"What is this 'Standard Oil'?\" \"What is its secret?\" \"Whence\r\ncame it?\" and, \"Can our republic endure if it, too, endures?\"\r\n\r\nTo-day \"Standard Oil,\" the \"Private Thing,\" is the greatest power in the\r\nland--more powerful than the people individually or as a whole, and its\r\nsecret is the knowledge of the trick of finance by which dollars are\r\n\"made\" from nothing in unlimited quantities subject to no laws of man\r\nnor nature. The dollars that \"Standard Oil\" _makes_ are of the same\r\nvalue as the dollars of the people as made by the Government, which\r\ndollars we know can be coined and put into circulation only in\r\naccordance with law and for the benefit of all the people.\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of those readers not versed in the\r\ntechnical phrases of finance and economics I shall in my narrative make\r\nuse of certain terms of my own which will convey meanings readily\r\ngrasped when the sense in which they are used is once comprehended. In\r\nspeaking of \"Standard Oil,\" for instance, I will speak of it as a\r\n\"Private Thing.\" By that term I desire to typify the active, private\r\nidentity of a corporation which comprehends, but exists independently\r\nof, its legalized functions. Some corporations have a real personality\r\nin addition to that which their name and the corporation laws prescribe\r\nfor them, an inherent power, or individuality, which exists above and\r\napart from their physical functions as sellers of oil, of coal, or of\r\nice. This may be an incarnation of the power developed in the\r\ntransaction of their legalized occupations, but the \"Private Thing\" is\r\nuncontrolled by any of the restrictions by which the law defines and\r\ncurbs the corporation whose name it bears. Already I have distinguished\r\nbetween \"Standard Oil\" which wields all the powers of its subsidiary\r\ncompanies, and Standard Oil, the seller of oil. In the same way we have\r\n\"American Sugar Refineries\" and \"United States Steel,\" the \"Private\r\nThings\" which are not one whit better than nor different from \"Standard\r\nOil,\" the \"Private Thing.\" Though this narrative will deal only with the\r\n\"Private Things,\" Bay State Gas and Amalgamated Copper, I have no\r\nhesitancy in saying that the methods employed and the results, good or\r\nbad, which accrued in the case of any of the other \"Private Things\" with\r\nwhich the public have had to do, differ only in details from those with\r\nwhich I shall deal in my story.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of dollars brought into existence by the trick of finance I\r\nhave referred to I shall call them henceforth \"made dollars,\" to\r\ndistinguish them from dollars coined by the Government and legitimately\r\nacquired by the individual or corporation. These \"made dollars,\" it must\r\nbe remembered, are really \"made\" for all purposes of use as surely as\r\nif they had the Government's stamp, yet they are not made in the sense\r\nof the known volume of the people's money being added to. So, however\r\nmany of these \"made dollars\" are brought into existence by this trick of\r\nfinance, only the men who \"made\" them can know and profit by their\r\nexistence. The people are no wiser nor can they adjust themselves to the\r\nchange of conditions brought about by the creation of all this new\r\nmoney; yet if \"unmade\" or lost, the entire volume of the nation's wealth\r\nwould be contracted.\r\n\r\nI can set before my readers better by an illustration than by any\r\nprocess of definition, the trick of finance by which \"made dollars\" are\r\nbrought into existence. Let us suppose that the United States Government\r\nat Washington, the only power legally entitled to issue money for\r\ncirculation among the people, puts forth a particular $10,000. All the\r\nconditions prescribed by law have been followed, and all the people in\r\nthe country are benefited by the issue and circulation of this\r\nparticular $10,000, each in the proportion the laws prescribe.\r\n\r\n\"B,\" a Western farmer, tills his soil and receives, by the sale of his\r\nwheat, the particular $10,000, which he then deposits in _The Bank_.\r\n_The Bank_, being a part of the Government machinery, only receives,\r\nholds, and uses the $10,000 under safeguards provided for by the laws of\r\nthe land, so hereafter \"B's\" material life is conducted on the basis\r\nthat he is the full and actual possessor of $10,000. He knows, further,\r\nthat his $10,000 cannot be expanded nor contracted, nor its relation to\r\nany of the other money of the people which is in circulation altered\r\nwithout his knowledge, because he knows such changes cannot come about\r\nexcept through the Government. I say he knows this--he has every right\r\nto believe he knows it--but, in fact, it is not so, because of the\r\nworking of the secret financial device of the Private Thing. At this\r\nstage enters \"C,\" the Private Thing.\r\n\r\n\"C\" purchases with $3,300 (\"B's\" money) which he borrows from _The\r\nBank_, a copper-mine, depositing the title which he receives from the\r\nseller with _The Bank_ as collateral for the $3,300. After purchasing he\r\narbitrarily calls the copper-mine worth $10,000--arbitrarily because\r\nhis act is not controlled nor regulated by any of the laws of the\r\nland--arbitrarily because the actual cost, $3,300, is his secret and his\r\nalone. Then, arbitrarily, \"C\" organizes his $3,300 of copper property\r\ninto the Arbitrary Copper Company, and issues to himself a piece of\r\npaper, which he arbitrarily stamps \"10,000 stock dollars.\" This he takes\r\nto _The Bank_, and by loan or other device exchanges it for the\r\nremaining $6,700 belonging to \"B,\" and thereafter \"C\" conducts his\r\naffairs on the basis that he is the possessor of $6,700, his \"made\r\ndollars\" in the transaction. At this stage there is actually in use\r\namong the people $16,700 where \"B,\" the legitimate factor, and his kind,\r\nthe people, suppose there is but $10,000--$10,000 which is recorded,\r\nknown and legal, being used by the legitimate factors, \"B\" and _The\r\nBank_, and $6,700 which is unrecorded and unknown to any but \"C\" and\r\n_The Bank_, being used by the illegitimate Private Thing \"C.\"\r\n\r\nRight here is the secret device, the financial trick, by which the\r\ngreatest power in the land has been created, and by which the people can\r\nbe absolutely plundered of their savings for the benefit of the few.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the two-thirds of \"B's\" $10,000, of which he later is to\r\nbe plundered, has not been actually taken away, so he cannot possibly\r\nhave any evidence yet of the process of pillage which has been begun, or\r\nthat the volume of money which he supposes is all that exists has been\r\ntremendously expanded. The next step is where \"C\" sells his $3,300,\r\nstamped \"10,000 stock dollars\" (which, as already shown, he has\r\nexchanged with _The Bank_ for the $10,000 deposited by \"B\"), to \"B\" for\r\n$10,000, which $10,000 \"B\" withdraws from _The Bank_ by simply making\r\nout a check in favor of \"C.\" (\"B's\" inducement to exchange his dollars\r\nfor the stock dollars of \"C\" is the high rate of interest that they will\r\nreturn in the form of dividends, which rate is much larger than _The\r\nBank_ can afford to pay.) \"C\" deposits \"B's\" check with _The Bank_ and\r\nhereby liquidates his $10,000 indebtedness to _The Bank_.\r\n\r\nAt this stage \"B\" is still the possessor of $10,000, but it is \"10,000\r\nstock dollars.\" \"C\" is the possessor of $6,700, and \"D,\" from whom the\r\ncopper-mine was purchased, is the possessor of $3,300; but the two\r\nlatter amounts make up the 10,000 real dollars, and _The Bank_ remains\r\nwhere it was at the beginning of the transaction. The people, however,\r\nare no wiser; but they know, because they have been most carefully\r\neducated to such knowledge by \"C's\" agents, Wall Street, and the press,\r\nthat their country is tremendously prosperous--that its great prosperity\r\nis evidenced by the $6,700 added wealth in the form of 6,700 new stock\r\ndollars. At the next stage the financial trick accomplished by the\r\nsecret device is complete. \"B,\" the farmer, who has contracted for new\r\nmachinery and other necessities and luxuries to be paid for \"next\r\nseason,\" attempts next season to turn his 10,000 stock dollars into real\r\ndollars, and \"C,\" the Private Thing, knowing their real value to be but\r\n$3,300, refuses to make the exchange, but instead, by proclaiming their\r\nreal value, compels \"B,\" who must have real dollars to meet his debts,\r\nto sell them for what \"C,\" the Private Thing, is willing to pay. \"C,\"\r\nthe Private Thing, is willing to pay their worth, which he alone knows\r\nis $3,300; he repurchases them at that price from \"B,\" that he may\r\nrepeat the operation at the return of the next \"wave of the country's\r\nprosperity.\"\r\n\r\nBy this operation \"B,\" the farmer, has lost, as absolutely as though\r\nthey had been taken away from him by a Government decree, $6,700 of his\r\nown making, and \"C,\" the Private Thing, has \"made,\" as absolutely as\r\nthough the Government had allowed him to coin them for his own benefit,\r\n6,700 real dollars, and _The Bank_, created, regulated, and controlled\r\nby law, and existing because of the people's deposits of money, has been\r\nthe instrument by which \"C,\" the Private Thing, has deprived \"B,\" the\r\nfarmer, of his savings, because \"C,\" the Private Thing, is at one and\r\nthe same time during the operation I have outlined, himself and _The\r\nBank_.\r\n\r\nA careful study of this illustration, by even laymen unacquainted with\r\nfinancial or corporation affairs, will clearly show that the foundation\r\nof this transaction was _The Bank's_ putting in jeopardy $3,300 of \"B's\"\r\ndeposited $10,000, and that if the $3,300, after being put in jeopardy,\r\nhad been lost, \"B\" would have been the loser,[2] which, in turn, means\r\nthat the compensation for the jeopardy in which the $3,300 was placed\r\nwas the possibility of $6,700 profit; and that, therefore, the $6,700\r\nprofit when made should have gone to the owner of the $3,300, \"B,\"\r\ninstead of to \"C,\" the user of it.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore in this sense that I shall use the term \"made\r\ndollars\"--wherever they are \"made\" or \"unmade\" through one set of men\r\nusing the dollars of another set of men without that other set knowing\r\nthat their dollars are being so used; and wherever the result of such\r\nuse is that when dollars are \"made,\" they are \"made\" by the ones who use\r\nothers' money, and where dollars are \"unmade,\" they are lost by the ones\r\nwho own the dollars which they don't know are being used.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] I say \"B\" would have been the loser because all money lost by a bank\r\nmust eventually be lost by the depositors, the people, or the surplus or\r\ncapital of the bank which belongs to the people, through their ownership of\r\nthe stock in the bank. Of course the loss of individual amounts such as\r\n$3,300 would not come directly on the people. But when the aggregate of the\r\nmoney put in jeopardy by the four classes of institutions I name--national\r\nbanks, savings-banks, trusts, and insurance companies--runs into billions\r\nand is lost, the loss _must_ fall on the people, because the only other\r\nones involved are the managers and controllers of these institutions, who\r\nalways see to it that when the losses which would wreck the bank are\r\nactually made, they, the managers and controllers, have no deposits and\r\nnone of the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF \"STANDARD OIL'S\" \"DOLLAR-MAKING\" MILL\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe \"Standard Oil\" was the first to utilize this secret device for\r\ncircumventing the safeguards which the law has erected to protect the\r\nsavings of the people. It was the first practically to apprehend that, a\r\nlarge proportion of all the moneys in circulation, which belong to the\r\npeople or the Government, being in the custody of the national and\r\nsavings-banks and trust and insurance companies, it would only be\r\nnecessary for a set of men to obtain control of sufficient of the\r\nprincipal national and savings-banks and trust and insurance companies\r\nto control practically unlimited amounts of such funds. Once in control\r\nof these funds dollars could be absolutely \"made\" at will by the three\r\nfollowing steps: 1st. Using the money in these institutions to acquire\r\nproperties. 2d. Consolidating such properties on an inflated basis, and\r\nselling them to the people (who, in fact, already owned them; because\r\nthey owned the funds with which they had been purchased); and, 3d, by\r\nstock-market trickery scaring their owners into re-selling them at an\r\nenormous shrinkage from the price they had paid. To understand a\r\nsituation with \"Standard Oil\" is to act, and twenty years ago it began\r\nto weave a net to secure control of the four classes of institutions I\r\nhave named.\r\n\r\nIts first move was to establish a great corporation, the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, and make its stock, 1,000,000 shares, sell at from $650 to $800\r\nper share, or $650,000,000 to $800,000,000. It kept its affairs\r\nmysteriously secret, it paid enormous dividends, and from time to time\r\nit caused to be published broadcast throughout the world the statement\r\nthat it was held in such value by its creators, the Rockefellers,\r\nRogers, etc, that they continued to own all but a few shares of the\r\nentire capital. To prove that there could be no doubt of such continued\r\nownership, the public's attention was repeatedly called to the fact that\r\nthe Standard Oil Company was the only great corporation which did not\r\nallow its shares to be traded in upon any of the stock-exchanges. As a\r\nmatter of fact, though they are not traded in on the regular\r\nstock-exchanges, they are actively bought and sold daily on the New York\r\n\"Curb.\"\r\n\r\nAt the height of the recent financial storm word went round that the\r\ncrafts of three over-night-made multimillionaires, men foremost in the\r\nseventh group of \"Standard Oil\" votaries, were in the trough of the\r\nfinancial sea and headed for the breakers, which were already strewn\r\nwith the wrecks of the people's savings. Following closely on the heels\r\nof these stories came the astounding one that each of these enormously\r\nrich men had, in his endeavors to raise large amounts of cash, disclosed\r\namong his assets blocks of \"Standard Oil\" stock ranging from 5,000 to\r\n20,000 shares each. Hardly had the public heard this before all\r\nfinancialdom knew that the storm-tossed crafts had received succor, and\r\nthat the crisis had passed. For one brief day the financial press of the\r\ncountry printed the item: \"Standard Oil came to the rescue by buying for\r\ncash large blocks of Standard Oil stock which had long been held by this\r\nor that interest for investment,\" and no more was thought of the\r\nincident. Even the most alert financiers never suspected that the most\r\nimportant stock secret of the age had been on the verge of becoming\r\npublic property.\r\n\r\nPlanted deep in the minds of the public that watches the comings and\r\ngoings of the Street is the conviction that Standard Oil is the holy of\r\nholies among stocks. The world has been taught to believe that the\r\nowners of Standard Oil regard the shares of the great oil corporation as\r\ntheir most precious, most sacred possessions. Yet while \"Standard Oil\"\r\nhas been so scientifically spreading abroad the impression that the\r\npublic would never be permitted to own Standard Oil stock, secretly it\r\nhas been engaged in exchanging that stock for the securities of the\r\npeople in the form of banks and trust companies, railroads, and other\r\nassets of definite value. So completely has \"Standard Oil\" pulled the\r\nwool over the eyes of the votaries of finance that there cannot be found\r\nin or out of Wall Street a single great financier who would not laugh to\r\nscorn the suggestion that \"Standard Oil\" is engaged in a campaign for\r\nthe distribution of its Standard Oil stock to the public. Yet pin your\r\ngreat financier down to the facts, and he'll admit that he himself has\r\nquite a block of the stock, and that institutions of which he is a\r\ndirector include among their assets in one form or another good-sized\r\nparcels of the inestimable security. But so completely are these very\r\nwise men held by the spells woven over them when for this or that\r\nspecial reason they were allowed as a favor to acquire their holdings,\r\nand so impressively have they been shown that their ownership in\r\nStandard Oil stock must be kept secret, that no suspicion has ever\r\nentered their minds that they were playing the part of lambs in its\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nNor was the episode I have described above allowed to disturb their\r\nserenity. It soon became known to the innermost circle of Wall Street\r\nthat the stock the three men had resold to \"Standard Oil\" represented\r\nthe share of each in some of the gigantic deals to which he had been a\r\nparty during the last ten years, and that with its acquirement had gone\r\na pledge that it would always be kept in the purchaser's \"tin box,\" and\r\nwhenever inspected by \"Standard Oil\" would be free from \"pinholes.\" And\r\nso, adroitly, dangerous deductions were prevented.\r\n\r\nFor the uninstructed I may say that a capitalist's \"tin box\" is the\r\nreceptacle for the stocks and bonds that largely represent his fortune,\r\nand pinholes in a stock certificate are in Wall Street conclusive\r\nevidence that such certificate has, at some period, temporarily passed\r\ninto other's hands as collateral for loans, for there has been pinned to\r\nit a memorandum or note stating the details of the transaction in which\r\nits owner parted with it. Pinholed securities are looked upon by the\r\nupper crust of big financiers with much the same horror as that with\r\nwhich members of the American social upper crust look upon their No. 10\r\nboots and gloves--reminders of their peasant ancestry.\r\n\r\nBut to return to \"Standard Oil's\" financial weavings: Their next move\r\nwas to use Standard Oil stock as the basis for loans, that is, as\r\ncollateral for money borrowed from the banks, trust and insurance\r\ncompanies, and treasuries of other great corporations and estates. The\r\nmoney thus acquired was paid out to purchase the control of banks and\r\ntrust and insurance companies in all parts of the United States, the\r\nStandard Oil ownership being represented by dummy directors and\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe next move represents another of the dazzling devices of finance in\r\nwhich \"Standard Oil\" is adept, and brings the process of artificial\r\nexpansion still further along. Control of a certain number of these\r\nsavings and national banks and trust and insurance companies having been\r\nacquired, the funds of each were so manipulated by depositing those of\r\none institution with another, and the latter's in turn with the first,\r\nas to swell the deposits of all and create in all of them an apparently\r\nlegitimate basis for increases of capitalization. At the same time there\r\nwas shown an apparently legitimate necessity for the establishment of\r\nadditional banking and trust companies, which were duly organized and\r\ntheir assets juggled around by the same process. The result of all this\r\nmanipulation defies description. Throughout the series of correlated\r\ninstitutions loans and deposits are multiplied in such an intricacy of\r\nduplication that only a few able experts, employed by the \"System\"\r\nbecause of their mathematical genius, are able to unravel the tangle to\r\nthe extent of approximating the proportion the legitimate funds bear to\r\nthose which have been created by the financial jugglery I have\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Standard Oil\" had gathered into its net sufficient of the\r\nimportant private institutions of finance there still remained the\r\nfederal Government, the largest handler of money in the country. It was\r\nnot hard for \"Standard Oil\" to introduce its expert votaries into the\r\nUnited States Treasury and thus to steer the millions of the nation into\r\nthe banks subject to the \"System's\" control. This accomplished, the\r\nstructure was complete and the process of \"making\" dollars proceeded on\r\na magnificent scale.\r\n\r\nThat there may be no possible doubt in the minds of those of my readers\r\nwho are unacquainted with such matters that I am citing every-day, actual\r\nhappenings, I will tell just how the Daly-Haggin-Tevis-Anaconda-Amalgamated\r\ntransaction was worked out, showing that but for the existence of the\r\nNational City Bank of New York, or a like institution of the people, it\r\ncould not have been brought about.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller \"traded\" with Messrs. Daly,\r\nHaggin, and Tevis for the Anaconda stock, and with others for like stock\r\nor other properties which I have already named, the price agreed upon\r\nwas $24,000,000 to Daly, Haggin, and Tevis, and $15,000,000 to the\r\nothers, or $39,000,000 in all. This was to be paid by \"Standard Oil\" and\r\nreceived by Daly, Haggin, and Tevis, and the others, but one of the\r\nstipulations in the \"trade\" was that instead of the money's being paid\r\nto Daly, Haggin, and Tevis, and others direct, it was to be credited to\r\nthem on the books of the National City Bank of New York and was to be,\r\nby agreement, not withdrawn from the bank before a given time, the bank\r\nagreeing that the new owners of this money should receive interest at a\r\nlow rate upon it while it so remained deposited. At the same time the\r\nbank agreed to loan Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller the $39,000,000\r\nat the same rate of interest upon the collateral which the $39,000,000\r\nwas used in purchasing. Therefore the first part of the transaction was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe bank, having $39,000,000 on hand belonging to the public in the form\r\nof savings deposited, or having a fictitious $39,000,000 in the form of\r\nbook-keeping accounts made possible by the deposits of the public and\r\nthe manipulation of the funds in other banks and trust and insurance\r\ncompanies belonging to the public or the Government, caused an entry to\r\nbe made in its books showing that this $39,000,000 had been loaned to\r\nMr. Rogers and William Rockefeller, and that they, having transferred it\r\nto Daly, Haggin, Tevis, and others, were, upon the books of the bank,\r\nthe real owners.\r\n\r\nThe second part was the summoning into the City Bank of certain\r\n\"Standard Oil\" lawyers, office-boys, and clerks, and the organization by\r\nthem of the Amalgamated Copper Company. The lawyers drew up the papers\r\nand the office-boys and clerks signed them. First, the papers certified\r\nthat \"whereas we (the office-boys and clerks) are desirous of taking\r\nadvantage of the corporation laws of the State of New Jersey, we (the\r\nsaid office-boys and clerks) do so take advantage of the said laws and\r\nform ourselves into the Amalgamated Copper Company, which will have a\r\ncapital of $75,000,000, and which will be allowed by said laws to own\r\ncopper-mines and other things, to mine copper and other things, to\r\nmanufacture, buy, sell, and trade in copper and other things, and to do\r\nnumerous and variegated other things; and that whereas we (the said\r\noffice-boys and clerks) have now become the Amalgamated Copper Company,\r\none of our number will purchase the entire capital stock of the said\r\nAmalgamated Copper Company for $75,000,000 cash, which $75,000,000 cash\r\nwe herewith certify to have been paid in the form of a check for\r\n$75,000,000, herewith delivered to the treasurer, one of our number, by\r\nthe clerk who drew it; and the treasurer, herewith certifying that he\r\nhas received the $75,000,000, herewith delivers unto said clerk the\r\n$75,000,000 capital stock of the Amalgamated Copper Company, and we (the\r\nsaid office-boys and clerks) herewith certify that there is within the\r\ntreasury of the Amalgamated Copper Company $75,000,000, and we (the said\r\noffice-boys and clerks) vote that it, the said $75,000,000, shall be\r\nused in the purchase of certain stocks and properties, and said certain\r\nstocks and properties shall be the same stocks and properties previously\r\npurchased by Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller, and now owned by them,\r\nand we (the said office-boys and clerks) herewith certify that we have\r\npaid from the treasury $75,000,000, that said $75,000,000 is in the form\r\nof a check, and said check is the one previously received, or its\r\nequivalent, by our treasurer, from one of our number, to wit, the clerk\r\nreferred to earlier in these papers, and said $75,000,000 has been paid\r\nto Henry H. Rogers for his and William Rockefeller's use.\" Henry H.\r\nRogers, now having $75,000,000, where formerly he had stocks and\r\nproperties which had cost him $39,000,000, and being desirous of\r\ninvesting it, purchased from the clerk the $75,000,000 of Amalgamated\r\nstock which he, the clerk, had previously purchased from the treasury of\r\nthe Amalgamated Company, Mr. Rogers promptly paying for said purchase\r\nwith the $75,000,000 check or its equivalent, which has already done\r\nsuch yeoman service.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Amalgamated Copper Company of New Jersey now\r\nbeing complete, and the company being in possession of all the property\r\nwhich had formerly belonged to Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller, and\r\nwhich had cost them $39,000,000, and the clerk having again come into\r\npossession of his $75,000,000 check, and Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller being the sole owners of the $75,000,000 of Amalgamated\r\nstock, the second part of this transaction was completed. The third\r\nbegan by the office-boys and clerks resigning from their positions as\r\ndirectors and officers of the Amalgamated Copper Company of New Jersey\r\nin favor of the more responsible and better known \"Standard Oil\"\r\nvotaries. Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller then had the National City\r\nBank of New York offer for sale to the public the $75,000,000 of stock\r\nin such a way that, although it was then the private property of Mr.\r\nRogers and William Rockefeller, the public were led to believe it was\r\nthe property of the Amalgamated Copper Company. Simultaneously, the\r\nNational City Bank of New York offered to loan the public its deposits\r\nat the rate of ninety cents on the dollar, on any amount of the\r\nAmalgamated stock it, the public, purchased; whereupon the public,\r\ntaking advantage of this offer, agreed to purchase from the National\r\nCity Bank of New York the $75,000,000 of stock for $75,000,000, thereby\r\nenabling it to certify upon its books that the $39,000,000 it had loaned\r\nto Messrs. Rogers and Rockefeller had been repaid, and enabling Mr.\r\nRogers and William Rockefeller, after paying said debts to the National\r\nCity Bank of New York, to become the absolute owners of $36,000,000 of\r\nmoney, none of which they had owned before, and which they had \"made\" as\r\nabsolutely as though they had coined it by permit from the Government\r\nof the people who had parted with it.[3]\r\n\r\nThe fourth part of the transaction began when months afterward the\r\npublic, who had borrowed their money from the National City Bank of New\r\nYork and other banks and trust and insurance companies to buy\r\nAmalgamated stock at 100 cents on the dollar, were compelled to repay\r\nit, and to do so were obliged to sell the Amalgamated stock which they\r\nhad purchased at $100 per share for the best price they could get, which\r\nwas $33 per share; and if we suppose for a moment that the \"Standard\r\nOil,\" after repurchasing it at $33 per share, at a later day repeated\r\nthe operation of selling it for $100 per share, it will be seen that\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" the \"Private Thing,\" would thereby \"make\" an additional\r\n$50,000,000, as absolutely as though they had been allowed by the\r\nGovernment to coin it.[4]\r\n\r\nThis explanation is not the creation of an extravagant fancy. It is not\r\nromance, but reality. The thing described was a supreme manifestation of\r\nthe \"System,\" of the perfect working of that tremendous financial\r\nmachine which reaps, grinds, and harvests for its own benefit, the\r\nearned savings of the American people.\r\n\r\nIn showing how these thirty-six millions were made in the brief space of\r\nthis creature's (Amalgamated Copper's) life, I deal with reality and not\r\nromance; but let my readers for a moment give their imaginations play\r\nand picture to themselves one scene in this stupendous drama. A great\r\nroom in the greatest banking house in America, if not in the\r\nworld--silent, solemn--an atmosphere of impregnable rectitude--the solid\r\nfurniture, the heavy carpets, the chill high walls, the massive desks,\r\nthe impressive chairs, the great majestic table portentously suggestive\r\nof power. Presto! the dim calm is broken; the air vibrates as when an\r\nancient church is invaded by a swarm of vampire-bats. Into the great\r\nroom enter a group of men and a flock of youths, who settle in the\r\nimpressive chairs round the majestic table. You wonder what is the\r\nmotive of the assemblage. These grave lawyers, whose names are weighty\r\nin the nation's councils, and these gray-haired, dignified financiers\r\nmight well be gathered to arbitrate a dispute involving empires; but why\r\nthese office-boys and clerks, with their restless, surprised eyes and\r\nuneasy gestures? The flourishing of papers, the murmuring of voices in a\r\nconfusion of \"seventy-five million,\" \"we buy,\" \"we sell,\" \"we are,\" \"we\r\nwill\"--words, nothing but words; then silence as one reads from a stiff\r\nparchment certain resolutions which the suave gentleman with incisive\r\nsteel-clicking manners, at the head of the table, puts to a vote. Then\r\nthese youths, whose souls are afire with the hope of a director's $5\r\ngold fee, timidly sign the record, trembling the while lest a blot call\r\ndown on them a scolding; a head clerk, whose fondest dream is a raise of\r\nsalary as the result of coming under the Master's eye in a\r\nseventy-five-million-dollar deal, affixes a seal, and there is an\r\nexchanging of thin slips of paper--checks--dollars--magically \"made\r\ndollars.\" Exit office-boys and lawyers.\r\n\r\nThe door closes--silence again. Then the air vibrates with the sound of\r\na hearty hand-slap and the genial, whole-souled greeting of the \"Master\"\r\nto his partner. \"William, I feel as though I had done an honest day's\r\nlabor! Thirty-six million dollars 'made' and no hitch, no delay!\" Then\r\nfollows the partner's mild answer: \"Yes, Harry, but don't forget James'\r\nand the others' shares will shrink it up quite a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThirty-six million dollars for _one honest day's labor_! Thirty-six\r\nmillion dollars--and Alaska cost us but seven millions and Spain\r\nrelinquished to us her claims on the Philippines for only twenty\r\nmillions. Thirty-six million dollars!--more than a hundred times as much\r\nas George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and \"Abe\" Lincoln together\r\nsecured for the patriotic labors of their lifetimes. And this vast sum\r\nwas taken from the people to enrich men whose coffers were already, as\r\nthe results of similar operations, so full of dollars that neither they\r\nnor their children, nor their children's children could count them--as\r\nthe people count their savings, a dollar at a time--as thoughtlessly\r\ntaken as are the apples that the school-boy steals after he has eaten so\r\nmany that he can eat no more.\r\n\r\nA thousand times have I tried to figure out in my mind what worlds of\r\nmisery such a sum of millions might allay if issued by a government and\r\nintelligently distributed among a people--and do my readers know that\r\nnever in the world's recorded history has any nation felt itself rich\r\nenough to devote thirty-six millions to the cause of charity--even in\r\nthe midst of the most awful calamities of fire, flood, war, or\r\npestilence? On the other hand, I have had to know about the horrors, the\r\nmisfortunes, the earthly hell, which were the awful consequences of the\r\nappropriation of this vast amount. I have had to know about the\r\nconvicts, the suicides, the broken hearts, the starvation and\r\nwretchedness, the ruined bodies and lost souls which strewed the fields\r\nof the \"System's\" harvest.\r\n\r\nPondering all these things, I have ceased to wonder at the deep murmurs\r\nof discontent that are rising, rising to my ears from all parts of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nCan it be that a just God suffers the sons and daughters of some of us\r\nto eke out a bare existence as the best reward of earnest effort and\r\nsterling worth, and at the same time rewards these other men with\r\n$36,000,000 for one day's labor? Is this the freedom which our fathers\r\nand our sons died on many a bloody, hard-fought field to preserve? I am\r\nconscious of a haunting fear that these men and women may not always be\r\npatient, may not always be put off with skilled evasion or slippery\r\nsubterfuge, and for one brief moment I see visions of a marching people,\r\nbearing aloft grisly heads on gory poles, and hear above the low,\r\nbestial murmur of the mob the cry for bread and for revenge.\r\n\r\nAnd then I remember that this is _America_, not France; that our laws\r\nare strong--if but the people are aroused to see them obeyed; that our\r\nprisons are ample, even though they be for the present filled with petty\r\nrascals who can do but little harm though turned loose to make room for\r\nthe real scoundrels who are undermining the foundations of our\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] It must be remembered that the Amalgamated Company never owned all the\r\ncapital stock of the Anaconda, but, on the contrary, only a few shares over\r\n600,000, which represented the ownership of the Haggin-Tevis-Daly people,\r\nand which they had turned in for a lump sum before the market price had\r\nadvanced. The control of the Parrott, owned by the Amalgamated Company, was\r\npurchased for a lump amount from Franklin Farrell and his associates for\r\nthe sum of $4,000,000-odd, not $12,190,000. The Colorado Smelting and\r\nMining Company was also purchased in a lumped batch of Senator Wolcott, not\r\nat $7,000,000, but for $2,000,000-odd, while the tremendous advance in the\r\nprice of Anaconda in the market from 30 to 70 was due to the operations of\r\nMessrs. Rogers and Rockefeller for their private account, out of which they\r\nmade a large additional profit.\r\n\r\nThere can be no possibility of mistake or successful misrepresentation of\r\nthese figures: first, because the Anaconda figures are known not only to\r\nMr. Rogers, William Rockefeller, and myself, but to J. B. Haggin, and to\r\nthe estates of Tevis and Marcus Daly; the Colorado figures, to associates\r\nof Senator Wolcott and to his estate; and the Parrott figures, to Mr.\r\nFarrell who received the money, and to a large number of those to whom he\r\nhad to account; and, further, these figures will all be demonstrated in\r\nopen court in suits outside of any with which I have to do, which are now\r\nbeing brought or are pending.\r\n\r\n[4] As a matter of fact, the people lost even more than thirty-six millions\r\nof dollars on this part of the Amalgamated transaction, because \"Standard\r\nOil\" did not sell all the 750,000 shares at $100 per share ($75,000,000) at\r\nthat time. They retained two-thirds of them, which at a later date they fed\r\nout to the public at $115 per share, and at a still later date they took\r\nthem back at $33 per share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nJUGGLING WITH MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the transaction I have just described the machinery\r\nof a great bank or trust company was essential. The vast profit gained\r\nhere was absolutely \"made\" through the instrumentality of the National\r\nCity Bank of New York, but some other tractable institution would have\r\nbeen equally efficient. In order that my readers may focus such great\r\nfinancial concerns as this National City Bank, I give right here brief\r\nrésumés of its career and resources and of those of two of its\r\naffiliated institutions:\r\n\r\n     NATIONAL CITY BANK      New York City\r\n\r\n     JAMES STILLMAN, _President_.\r\n\r\n     The \"City Bank\" was chartered by the New York Legislature in\r\n     1812, and reorganized as a National Bank July 17, 1865. The\r\n     capital paid in was $1,000,000. Moses Taylor held the office\r\n     of president for thirty-four years, and died in 1892, when\r\n     Percy R. Pyne, son-in-law of Moses Taylor, was elected\r\n     president and held office until the election of James\r\n     Stillman, of Woodward & Stillman, cotton merchants, when the\r\n     capital stock of the bank was increased to $10,000,000, and\r\n     again increased to $25,000,000. The sworn report of the\r\n     officers and directors filed with the Controller of the\r\n     Currency shows that the condition of the bank, January,\r\n     1904, was:\r\n\r\n     RESOURCES\r\n\r\n     Loans and discounts                                    $114,507,919.20\r\n     Overdrafts secured and unsecured                                162.90\r\n     United States bonds to secure circulation                 3,220,000.00\r\n     United States bonds to secure United States deposits     12,937,000.00\r\n     United States bonds on hand                                  60,120.00\r\n     United States bond account                                4,450,000.00\r\n     Premiums on United States bonds                           1,354,013.00\r\n     Stocks, securities, etc.                                 16,709,241.62\r\n     Banking-house furniture and fixtures                        200,000.00\r\n     Due from national banks (not reserve agents)              4,727,461.12\r\n     Due from State banks and bankers                            644,288.80\r\n     Exchange for clearing-house                              31,000,935.34\r\n     Checks and other cash items                                 798,843.22\r\n     Notes of other national banks                               209,015.00\r\n     Fractional paper currency, nickels, and cents                   684.63\r\n       Lawful money reserve in bank, viz.:\r\n     Specie                                 $36,928,350.00\r\n     Legal tender notes                       7,100,000.00    44,028,350.00\r\n     Redemption fund with U.

It is the third largest insurance\r\n     company in the United States. The assets of the company\r\n     January 1, 1892, were $125,947,290, and income $31,854,194.\r\n     In 1904 the assets were $352,652,048; income, $88,269,531.\r\n\r\n     THE NATIONAL SHAWMUT BANK, OF BOSTON\r\n\r\n     This institution was incorporated in 1898 with a paid-in\r\n     capital of $3,000,000. In 1904 its total resources, also\r\n     liabilities, were $63,471,639, of the same general character\r\n     as those of the National City Bank of New York.\r\n\r\nA calm examination of these figures, illuminated by the explanation of\r\nthe \"System's\" methods I have previously given, will awaken the\r\nAmerican people to a comprehension of what use \"high finance\" makes of\r\nthe savings of the public intrusted to it for legitimate investment.\r\n\r\nNor must it be supposed for one minute that the insurance company and\r\nthe Boston bank which I have used for illustrations differ in any way\r\nfrom scores and scores of their kind which are as absolutely \"steered\"\r\nin their operations by the National City Bank of New York as the\r\nNational City Bank of New York is absolutely \"steered\" by its president,\r\nJames Stillman, or as James Stillman is absolutely \"steered\" by\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" the Private Thing, or as \"Standard Oil,\" the Private\r\nThing, is absolutely \"steered\" by its supreme heads, Henry H. Rogers,\r\nWilliam Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller. And if any doubt remains\r\nin the minds of my readers of the absolute power of \"Standard Oil,\" the\r\nPrivate Thing, to \"make\" dollars at will, or of the dead-sure working of\r\ntheir \"heads-I-win-and-tails-you-lose\" gambling game, I ask them\r\ncarefully to analyze the above statements in connection with the facts\r\nin the Amalgamated transaction which just precede them.\r\n\r\nFourteen years ago the National City Bank passed out of the legitimate\r\nmanagement of old-fashioned business men of the Moses Taylor stamp and\r\ninto the hands of the \"System,\" the Private Thing. Then its capital was\r\n$1,000,000; it is to-day $25,000,000, and after having paid out millions\r\nin dividends and other profits it has, in addition, a surplus of\r\n$16,000,000, and it has the absolute power to juggle with a total of\r\n$235,000,000, $36,000,000 of which belong to other national banks,\r\n$6,000,000 to State banks and bankers, $29,000,000 to trust companies\r\nand savings-banks, $82,000,000 to individual depositors, $10,000,000 to\r\nthe holders of certified checks, $7,000,000 to the holders of cashiers'\r\nchecks, $13,000,000 to the Government directly, and $4,000,000 in\r\nGovernment bonds, to say nothing of scores of hundreds of millions more\r\nthrough its affiliated institutions. And all this juggling is done in\r\nsuch a fearless manner that we find it in the Amalgamated deal loaning\r\nin one transaction an amount so great that if it had been lost, the\r\nbank's entire capital would have been more than completely wiped out.\r\nThat my readers may not base their conclusions upon this one\r\ntransaction of this mighty engine of the \"System,\" vicious as it shows\r\non the surface and destructive as it really was to the thousands who\r\nwere parties to it, _I will later in this story show the National City\r\nBank in another section of the Amalgamated deal, doing things which in\r\nintention and in result were so much bolder and grosser that this\r\ntransaction will by comparison appear pure and legitimate_.\r\n\r\nDuring the past thirty years the American people have become so used to\r\nenormous figures in connection with corporations and trusts that they\r\nhave not stopped to discriminate between different classes of fortunes\r\nnor to figure out that fortunes of certain kinds are absolute\r\nself-evidence that they were acquired by illegal methods, and that if\r\nallowed to multiply the people will surely be enslaved and the republic\r\ndestroyed. For instance, there are in New York City alone dozens of\r\nnational and savings-banks and insurance and trust companies which\r\ncontrol money enough to make them practically omnipotent in whatever\r\ndirection their controllers exert their power. I will name but seven,\r\nshowing what enormous amounts their managers control; and let it be\r\nborne in mind that all such institutions are linked together by the\r\n\"System\" as firmly and surely as any human things can be linked. The\r\nEquitable, Mutual, and New York Life Insurance companies have a combined\r\ncapital of $1,200,000,000 of assets, a yearly income of $230,000,000,\r\nand $4,500,000,000 of insurance in force; the National City Bank, United\r\nStates Trust, Mercantile Trust, and Union Trust companies $30,000,000\r\ncapital, and $45,000,000 surplus, and they have the vast sum of\r\n$450,000,000 of the people's money to juggle with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\"STANDARD OIL\" INVESTS \"MADE DOLLARS\" IN GAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I shall have to go back a bit in my story. After \"Standard Oil\"\r\nhad firmly established, through the agency of the curb,[5] the value of\r\nthe 1,000,000 shares of Standard Oil, the corporation seller of oil, at\r\nbetween $600,000,000 and $800,000,000, and had used it as collateral in\r\nsecuring control of the four classes of money institutions I have\r\nnamed--the national and savings-banks and trust and insurance\r\ncompanies--it proceeded to use the funds thus controlled to manipulate\r\nthe stocks of great public corporations for its own profit, forming them\r\ninto trusts with capitals far beyond their values, represented by new\r\nstocks and bonds, which it sold to the public at prices aggregating a\r\nhundred to five hundred per cent. over the old capitalization. It then\r\nengaged in a wonderfully clever campaign to work off on the\r\npeople--directly, the very rich people, but indirectly, the people as a\r\nwhole--through institutions which exist because of the people's\r\nsavings--the $600,000,000 to $800,000,000 of Standard Oil stock which\r\nhad at this stage served the principal use for which it had been\r\ncreated. It must be borne in mind that while \"Standard Oil\" is grinding\r\nout \"made dollars,\" its owners never for an instant lose sight of that\r\ndim, distant day of reckoning when the people will awaken to their\r\nlosses. The \"Rogerses\" and the \"Rockefellers\" know well that the public\r\ncannot always be kept in ignorance of the methods of the \"System\" by\r\nwhich it has been plundered, and that once it is in possession of the\r\nsecret of how the savings of the many have become the property of the\r\nfew, there may be reprisals of such a nature as will compel the \"System\"\r\nto yield up its gains. They know that when that day comes it will not be\r\nbest for them to have their enormous fortunes in such get-at-able\r\nproperty as real estate, in which so many of the legitimately acquired\r\nAmerican fortunes are invested. In a quiet way, therefore, they have put\r\nthe bulk of their \"made dollars\" into unrecorded forms, such as\r\nGovernment bonds; bonds and preferred stocks of what they consider\r\nnon-duplicatable franchise corporations such as railroads, which require\r\nrights of way; into municipal public service enterprises, such as gas\r\ncompanies, the existence of which depends upon rights of way for pipes;\r\nand into the stocks of banks and trust and insurance companies, which\r\nthey believe the people will never dare attack because their savings are\r\nlargely deposited in them.\r\n\r\nI would not have my readers think that the principal motive actuating\r\n\"Standard Oil\" in parting with its Standard Oil stock is doubt of its\r\npresent intrinsic worth, for such is not the case. The masters of\r\n\"Standard Oil\" are very able, far-seeing men, and they know that so\r\nthoroughly have the American people been educated to the crimes which\r\ncreated Standard Oil, the crimes by which it has existed and does exist,\r\nthat no passage of time or \"pious-ing\" of latter-day methods, will ever\r\nblind them to its iniquities, and that when reprisal day comes, as come\r\nit surely will, the first thing the people in their frenzy will look for\r\nwill be Standard Oil. This is the reason which, more than any other,\r\ninfluences them in selling to others an enterprise which has up to the\r\npresent time not only enjoyed tremendous prosperity, but which has as\r\nyet met with no obstacle or hindrance.\r\n\r\nOf all forms of tangible investment \"Standard Oil\" has looked most\r\nfavorably upon gas stocks, and its secret devices have been worked\r\novertime in consolidating gas companies throughout the United States. In\r\na general way, as manufacturers of illuminating oil, \"Standard Oil\" had\r\nearly become familiar with the problems of supplying large\r\ncommunities--cities--with gas light; and with the advent of water-gas,\r\nas sellers of petroleum they controlled an important factor in the\r\nproduction of that volatile commodity. All the talent of the \"System,\"\r\ntrained in \"handling\" municipal authorities, came into play in this big\r\nnew business of lighting cities--a business which perforce became a\r\nmonopoly as soon as the powerful tentacles grasping it were recognized\r\nas \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time my story opens (1894) \"Standard Oil\" had already captured\r\nthe gas-lighting corporations of certain of the great cities of the\r\nUnited States, including the immensely rich ones of New York (directly),\r\nPhiladelphia and Chicago (indirectly); and for two years previously had\r\nbeen besieging the several independent Brooklyn companies for the\r\npurpose of consolidating them into a single gigantic corporation. This\r\nproject it has since accomplished. Its intention is to weld this\r\ncorporation with the great one that already holds the monopoly of\r\nManhattan.\r\n\r\nThe task of diagramming a territory for invasion is one after Henry H.\r\nRogers' own heart. His campaigns are planned with Napoleonic power and\r\nforesight. When the capture of Brooklyn was decided on, the several\r\ncorporations to be subdued were \"sized up\" as to their revenues and\r\nliabilities; the resources of their stockholders were studied out, and a\r\nplan of action organized to separate each one from his shares at\r\n\"hard-pan\" prices. In the \"Standard Oil\" armory there are many\r\ninstruments of \"persuasion,\" and he is indeed a hardy fellow who can\r\nresist the various \"trying-out\" processes to which mutineers are\r\nsubjected. This obstinate capitalist will be summarily knocked on the\r\nhead; that other inveigled into a dark corner by a strong-arm man;\r\nanother group owe money to one of the \"System's\" banks and a brief spell\r\non the financial rack will weaken their grip. Sooner or later all\r\nsuccumb. While such details as these were being attended to, lines were\r\nbeing strung here and there to bring about the passage by the city of\r\nBrooklyn and the Legislature of New York State of ordinances and laws\r\nwhich should allow this and compel that to be done, and so rivet the\r\nvarious links of the great venture.\r\n\r\nWhile in the midst of this campaign, to which Henry H. Rogers' genius,\r\nmatured in many a hard-fought business battle, foresaw an early and easy\r\ntriumphal termination, there came athwart his victorious path a\r\nfinancial guerilla, \"balloony,\" mysterious, yet as sticky as a\r\njelly-fish, who was destined to exert a most maleficent influence on his\r\nafter-life. Fate hangs no red lights at the cross-roads of a man's\r\ncareer. No \"pricking of his thumbs,\" no strange portents warned the\r\nMaster of \"Standard Oil\" that the impudent Philadelphia swashbuckler who\r\ndared interfere with the execution of his plan to fetter the \"System's\"\r\nyoke to the necks of the citizens of Brooklyn was the factor that\r\ndestiny had chosen to shape the ends that he had rough-hewn.\r\n\r\nThe financial guerilla was J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, votary of\r\nrotten finance, perpetual candidate for the United States Senate,\r\nwholesale debaucher of American citizenship and all-round corrupter of\r\nmen--J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, a corporation political trickster,\r\nwho has done more to hold up American laws, American elective\r\nfranchises, and American corporations to the scorn of the civilized\r\nworld than any other man of this or any previous age.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The New York \"curb\" is the latest invention in finance, coming closely\r\nupon the heels of the invention of trusts, and it holds the same relation\r\nto the New York Stock Exchange that Private Things hold to corporations.\r\nBefore a stock can be bought and sold on the New York Stock Exchange, there\r\nmust be submitted to the governors a description of what the stock is,\r\nwhich must be of such tangibility that any one who cares to investigate may\r\nfind there every detail and particular of the property represented, set\r\nforth with the utmost exactitude. But on the \"curb\" stocks can be traded in\r\nwithout responsible sponsors or descriptions that mean anything. In other\r\nwords, a stock may be bought and sold there, which is so vague and\r\nindefinite as to be little more than a name, and it is through the \"curb\"\r\nthat the value of \"Standard Oil\" stock is established, for it is daily\r\nbought and sold there at the steadily held prices of 650 to 800, and the\r\npress of the world makes daily record of these prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA VOTARY OF THE \"SYSTEM\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"System\" has all sorts of votaries. About J. Edward O'Sullivan\r\nAddicks there is nothing that remotely suggests coworkers of the types\r\nof Mr. Rogers and William Rockefeller. A description that left him in\r\nany part a duplicate of either would do him and them a grievous wrong.\r\nHenry H. Rogers and William Rockefeller have two sides, their social\r\nside and their business side. Socially, they are good men; in business\r\nthey work evil. J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks is a bad man, socially, in\r\nbusiness, in every way. The term \"bad man\" is used advisedly. My idea of\r\na \"bad man\" is that like a bad dollar he is a counterfeit. A counterfeit\r\nhas all the appearances of reality, and is yet devoid of its properties\r\nand virtues. So with Addicks. It is easy to find men who will declare by\r\nall that is sacred that Henry H. Rogers is one of the best fellows in\r\nthe world, though as many more will as earnestly proclaim him the fiend\r\nincarnate. About Addicks, among those who know the man, there is but one\r\nopinion. I have yet to meet the man, woman, or child who would say aught\r\nof Addicks, after a month's acquaintance, other than, \"Don't mention\r\nhim! He is the limit.\" And it will be said with the calm of\r\ndispassionate conviction, as one might speak of a stuffed tiger in a\r\ndime-museum jungle.\r\n\r\nHere we have a man without a heart, without a soul, and, I believe,\r\nabsolutely without conscience--the type of man who even his associates\r\nfeel is likely to bring in after their deaths queer bills against their\r\nestates as an offset for what he owes them; the type of man whose\r\npromise is just as good as his bond, and whose bond is so near his\r\npromise as to make it absolutely immaterial to him which you take.\r\n\r\nExhibited in the side show of one of the great circuses some years ago\r\nwas a strange creature which, for lack of a better name, its owner and\r\nthe public dubbed, \"A What Is It?\" This freak had the semblance of\r\nhumanity, and yet was not human. All its functions and feelings reversed\r\nthe normal. Tickle it and it would cry bitterly; pinch or torture it and\r\nit would grin rapturously; when starved it repelled food, and when\r\noverfed it was ravenous for more. It had heart-beats but no heart. The\r\npublic gave it up. The public would long ago have given up J. Edward\r\nO'Sullivan Addicks if he would have let them.\r\n\r\nIllustration is better than explanation, and perhaps I can more\r\ngraphically set J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks before my readers by a few\r\nincidents which show his contradictory characteristics in action than by\r\nverbal diagrams, however laborious.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time Addicks, entering Delmonico's for dinner, stumbled on a\r\ncouple of newsboys at the entrance. One, broken-hearted, was being\r\nconsoled by the other. Addicks, observing the deep sobs, asked: \"What's\r\nthe matter with you, bub?\" The consoler explained that his chum had lost\r\n$2, his day's earnings and capital, and \"His mudder--his fadder's\r\ndead--an' de baby'll git trun outter de tenement.\" Addicks, without more\r\nado, slipped the suffering young news-merchant a bill which his friends\r\nsupposed was $2 to replace the lost funds. As they were taking off their\r\ncoats in the hall, however, the little newsboy pushed his way in with:\r\n\"Say, boss, did yer mean ter guv me de twenty?\" Addicks nodded a\r\ngood-natured assent, and his friends registered silently a white mark to\r\nhis score, and felt that, after all, somewhere beneath the surface he\r\nwas more of the right sort than they had given him credit for being.\r\nAfter dinner, as they left, the newsboy again approached. \"'Scuse me,\r\nboss, but me chum 'd like ter t'ank yer too. I'm goin' ter give him a V\r\noutter it.\" Addicks looked at the boy in his mildly cold way and said:\r\n\"Let me have that bill. I will change it for you.\" The boy gave it up,\r\nand Addicks, after methodically placing it in his purse, handed him back\r\na $2 bill with: \"That's what you lost, isn't it? And you\" (to the\r\nsecond little fellow, who by this time had mapped out visions of new\r\nduds for the kids and a warm seat in the gallery of a Bowery theatre),\r\n\"you didn't lose anything, did you? Well, both of you run along now!\"\r\n\r\nHis friends looked at each other, and from their slates wiped away the\r\nwhite mark and replaced it with a deep, broad, black one. And yet\r\nAddicks had made good the loss--done a good deed, but in an--Addicks\r\nway. I should perhaps remark that J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks has never\r\nsmoked, nor used a swear-word, nor taken liquor in any form.\r\n\r\nDuring the Addicks gas campaign in Boston one of his lieutenants\r\ndemanded as his share of the deal a large amount of money, which he\r\nclaimed Addicks was withholding from him. Addicks refused to pay.\r\nFriends and associates urged him to settle. While yet refusing, he\r\nagreed to meet this man at one of the leading hotels in the presence of\r\ncounsel and lieutenants. The interview was a hot one. Addicks surprised\r\nall by his absolute fearlessness in the face of a savage attack, which\r\nculminated in the production of a document signed by certain\r\nMassachusetts legislators, wherein they receipted for the bribe money\r\nAddicks had paid for their votes. The man who claimed he was being\r\ncheated threatened this would be laid before the Grand Jury the\r\nfollowing day. All the witnesses were dumfounded at the situation and in\r\nconcert begged Addicks to hush the matter up by paying what was claimed.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said this great financier, \"my honor, my business and my\r\npersonal honor, has been assailed, and rather than submit to this\r\noutrage I would die! I now ask you all to bear witness that under no\r\ncircumstances will I pay to this man a single dollar!\" And he\r\nindignantly left the meeting.\r\n\r\nWhile his counsel and associates were appalled at what might be the\r\noutcome, they admired Addicks' manly pluck, and asked themselves if they\r\nhad not, after all, been mistaken in their estimates of his courage and\r\nprinciple. In the middle of the same night, the man with the document\r\nwas surprised by a telegram reading: \"Meet me in Jersey City to-morrow\r\nsure with paper; keep absolutely secret.\" Next day in Jersey they met,\r\nand Addicks simply said: \"There is the full amount. Give me the paper.\r\nYou don't suppose I would compound a felony in the State in which it was\r\ncommitted, and before witnesses, do you?\"\r\n\r\nIn the national election of 1896 J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks was a\r\ncandidate for the United States Senate in Delaware, and for a variety of\r\nreasons was anxious to secure a Republican victory. Within the State,\r\nhowever, the real contest was not over national issues, but to obtain\r\ncontrol of the Legislature which in the following January had to elect a\r\nUnited States Senator. There were three factions, the Democrats and two\r\nwings of the Republicans, the Addicks and anti-Addicks parties, the\r\nlatter calling themselves \"regulars.\" On Election Day Addicks used an\r\neven $100,000 buying votes, and that evening Delaware was safe for\r\nMcKinley--both the \"regulars\" and the men whom Addicks' money bought\r\nhaving voted for a Republican President. But it was early bruited around\r\nthat if the vote of Sussex County (there are three counties in\r\nDelaware--Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex) were allowed to stand as\r\nreceived, all Addicks' efforts to control the Legislature would have\r\nbeen fruitless and his \"made dollars\" expended for nothing. The ex-flour\r\ndealer of Philadelphia was not satisfied to accept the people's sacred\r\nverdict. He quickly called his lieutenants together, mapped out a\r\ncampaign of almost reckless audacity and daring, and assigned his best\r\nmen to its execution.\r\n\r\nThe ballot-boxes with their contents were in the sheriff's charge and\r\nstored under lock and key in the court-house. The sheriff was an Addicks\r\ntool. At midnight he turned over his charge to one of the would-be\r\nstatesman's trustiest lieutenants, who, with the aid of a lantern and a\r\nslip of paper containing the directions, sorted over the legal ballots,\r\nthrew some out, and put in new ones. When another sun arose the\r\ndastardly outrage upon the American elective franchise had been\r\ncompleted, and Addicks was busily scheming to carry out the remainder of\r\nthe plot. On the declaration which he or one of his associates would\r\nmake, that there had been fraud in Sussex County, the Government at\r\nWashington must send on an investigating committee to whom it would be\r\nasserted that the voting lists had been doctored by the Democrats. To\r\nprove it the boxes would be opened, the ballots counted, and lo! the\r\nvillany of the Democrats would be, beyond contradiction, demonstrated.\r\n\r\nBut the scheme was an Addicks scheme. Had it been the plot of any other\r\nman with the brains, the nerve, and the lack of principle to concoct it\r\nand set it in motion, inevitably it would have been carried through to\r\nthe designed conclusion. As it was, this is what happened: The\r\nlieutenant who had charge of the actual commission of the crime\r\nthoughtlessly chuckled over the details of it with another, and this\r\nother \"in the presence of witnesses\" laughingly congratulated Addicks on\r\nhis plan's success. What was the astonishment of the group to hear the\r\ncandidate for the Senate say: \"Gentlemen, I could not countenance such a\r\ntransaction. This is the first I have heard of it, and it is so\r\noutrageously criminal that I refuse to allow it to proceed further.\r\nThere will be no investigation, and if it is a fact that those ballots\r\nhave been changed in the box, the ones who changed them shall receive no\r\nbenefit from their nefarious work. I have spoken.\"\r\n\r\nMind you, every member of the group was a party to the scheme and had\r\nbeen carefully rehearsed in the part assigned him by Addicks himself,\r\nbut alone, that is, without witnesses; nevertheless so earnest and\r\napparently honest was the man in his protest that for an instant they\r\ndoubted their senses--until they remembered it was Addicks.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was never held, and to this day Addicks' lieutenants,\r\nespecially he who did the midnight work and who still lives in the\r\npeaceful State of Delaware, turn with disgust when Addicks' daring is\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt should be explained here that, whenever Addicks plans an illegal\r\ntransaction--one for which he might be made civilly or criminally\r\nliable--he invariably coaches each of his accomplices alone, \"without\r\nwitnesses.\" And when it becomes necessary in developing the plot to have\r\na confab, at which the several parties to the proceeding must meet,\r\nAddicks is most careful to preserve a legal semblance of ignorance of\r\nincriminating details. At intervals, when a danger-place in the\r\ndiscussion is approaching, he will get up from his seat and, moving to\r\nthe door, will say: \"Gentlemen, halt right there, until I step out of\r\nthe room; tap at the door when you are over that bad spot, and I will\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks' \"Wait until I step out of the room\" is as familiar among his\r\ncoworkers as the \"I am going upstairs\" is among the \"Standard Oil\"\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nTry to conjure before your mind's eye a picture of the anomalous character\r\nthese instances suggest. I'll warrant your mental image as little\r\nresembles the original Addicks as Mr. Hyde did Dr. Jekyll in the story. He\r\ndoes not look the part assigned him here, nor any other part for that\r\nmatter. I saw him coming toward me on State Street one summer day some\r\nyears ago, a tall, wiry man, in a white-flannel suit, perfect in fit and\r\nspotless as snow, wearing a fine Panama hat. This was in the period before\r\nPanamas were commonly worn. He was to the life the elegant and luxurious\r\nSouthern planter of ante-bellum days. Six months afterward in about the\r\nsame place I saw approaching me a splendid person in rich sable outer\r\ngarments who looked for all the world like an exiled Russian grand duke.\r\nIt was Addicks in winter. You will not surprise his secret from that\r\npleasant, rather ambiguous, but square-jawed face, nor from the mouth\r\nhidden under a long, drooping, gray, military mustache. His is a\r\ngood-sized, well-shaped head, you might say, and the gray, shallow eyes\r\nthat look out at you are almost merry in their glances. But they are\r\ninscrutable eyes which seem to have a challenge in their gaze, a sort of\r\n\"look-me-over-as-long-as-you-like-and-you'll-never-guess-what's-under-the-surface\"\r\nexpression that is baffling and provocative. Yet this sybarite, this\r\ndaring coward, this stingy prodigal, this sincere hypocrite, this\r\nextraordinary blending of contradictory qualities, is the man who from\r\n1887 to 1892 made Boston look like the proverbial country gawk at\r\ncircus-time.\r\n\r\nPower the man certainly has, and of a distinct quality, yet his\r\nintimates cannot explain the reason of their obedience to him. After a\r\nbrief acquaintance he is revealed as the very soul of insincerity--he\r\n\"works\" his friends, he pays toll to his enemies, he frankly shows\r\nhimself without the sense of moral obligation. I believe his talent\r\nresides in his capacity to select the proper type of man to \"make rich\"\r\nin the illicit schemes his abnormal mind conceives. These coworkers of\r\nhis are of different grades; some have a super-abundance of cash; others\r\na desire to get it--in common are their lack of principle and dearth of\r\nbrains. Addicks cannot do business long with men of real ability, nor\r\ndoes he understand them, whereas he can read the minds of his ordained\r\nvictims as if they were an open book. The big men who have encountered\r\nor been associated with Addicks are prone to characterize him as a\r\nmountebank, a joker, or a chump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nADDICKS COMES TO BOSTON\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks was born in Philadelphia in 1841, and was\r\nin the eighties plodding along the ordinary, uneventful path of a seller\r\nof flour to the people of that city which since the death of William\r\nPenn holds the record for the highest and densest percentage of sleep\r\nper capita of any English-speaking community.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties two things happened that changed the whole course of J.\r\nEdward O'Sullivan Addicks' life. Some one invented water-gas and \"let\r\nin\" Addicks on the invention; and the Philadelphia branch of the\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" represented by Widener, Elkins, and Dolan, \"trustified\"\r\nthe gas companies of the city of Chicago, which enabled Addicks to \"hold\r\nup\" the \"trustification\" until Dolan and Dolan's associates paid him the\r\nsum of $300,000 for the instrument with which he had done the holding\r\nup, $10,000 worth of the stock of one of the necessary Chicago\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe law of compensation, which gets in its deadly work on all the\r\nprettiest plans of man, but decreed that what goes up must come down\r\nwhen it ceases going up. It has a shrewd trick of grafting sorrows on\r\nour joys, and of handicapping success with discomfiting conditions. The\r\nfavorite of fortune whose feet have fallen in pleasant places sooner or\r\nlater stubs his toe.\r\n\r\nAddicks' first \"made dollars\" certainly came easy--so easy, indeed, that\r\nthose who watched his early career marvelled at his success; but nowhere\r\non God's footstool is there to-day a more terrible illustration of the\r\ninevitable workings of the law of compensation than the present\r\nstanding of J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks affords.\r\n\r\nThe thief whose first excursion into a wayfarer's pocket is rewarded\r\nwith the equivalent of days and nights of honest labor will surely be\r\nconvinced thereafter of the superiority of theft over toil as a means of\r\nmoney-getting. Invariably the manufacturer of \"made dollars,\" after his\r\nfirst coup, forsakes forever after the cold arithmetic of commerce for\r\nthe rule of guess, dream, hope, and \"I will,\" which constitutes the\r\nmathematics of high finance. Addicks' first \"made dollars\" came with\r\nsuch magical ease that there awoke in his slumbering substitute for a\r\nsoul a disgust for those prosaic pursuits at which one could never, try\r\nhow one might, make more than four by the addition of two and two. He\r\nprobably argued to himself: \"Why should I work in the flour business\r\nwhen I know a way of getting overnight more than I can make out of flour\r\nin a lifetime? If people are so simple in guarding their savings that I\r\ncan by a trick take away from them enormous wealth without the slightest\r\ndanger to my own safety or my profit, even if detected, why should I not\r\ndevote my life to such healthful and profitable occupation?\" The logic\r\nof the proposition was convincing. Accepting its conclusions, J. Edward\r\nO'Sullivan Addicks, of Philadelphia, embarked on his career. Soon\r\nafterward he discovered gas in Boston.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1887. Equipped with his \"made dollars\" for capital, his\r\nimpressive name, sublime effrontery, and a pedigree free from anything\r\nsuggestive of his new purpose in life, the ex-flour merchant \"lit\" into\r\nour everything-figured-out-ahead-and-every-promise-made-taken-at-par\r\ntown of Boston. To appreciate the lights and shadows of this event, one\r\nshould know Boston and, at the same time, Addicks. Every country boy\r\nwill remember Tom Hood's poem beginning:\r\n\r\n    I remember, I remember the house where I was born,\r\n    With the little lattice window where the sun came peeping in at morn,\r\n\r\nand can recall milking-time in July or August when, sitting on the\r\nrail-fence surrounding the barn-yard, he watched the pigeons snipping\r\nup grain, the old hen scratching up worms for the chicks, the ducks and\r\nthe drakes and the geese and the ganders proudly waddling back and\r\nforth, among and around the fluffy ducklings and goslings, and the\r\nbull-pup sound asleep by the side of the tortoise-shell cat. Probably he\r\nwill think of some particular milking-time when the calm, contented\r\nserenity of the barn-yard was suddenly disturbed by the unexpected\r\ndescent in its midst of a neighboring peacock, who, apparently\r\nunconscious of the consternation produced by his entry, proceeded\r\nproudly to spread his dazzling plumage to convince every one, from Uncle\r\nCy, on the milking-stool, and mild-eyed Bess, down to the white\r\nfan-tailed dove, that he was--It.\r\n\r\nConjure up the picture--the peacock at milking-time in the farm-yard;\r\nthus Addicks came to Boston--though it is far from my intention to\r\nidentify the bucolic background I have drawn with the Hub of the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nBoston, up to this time, had been singularly free from the mushroom\r\nvariety of millionaire which had sprung up overnight in such numbers in\r\nNew York and Philadelphia. Proudly defiant of a product so alien to all\r\nher traditions, her citizens would have sworn that no votary of modern\r\nhigh finance could exist over one curfew-toll within her gates. For\r\nBoston had her own financial eminence, of a character in keeping with\r\nthe chill conditions of conservatism and rectitude appropriate to the\r\nmetropolis of the New England conscience. She had her Stock Exchange,\r\nher numerous great corporations, her scores of single and\r\nmultimillionaires, and it was her boast that her capital had played the\r\ngreatest legitimate part in the country's growth. She had furnished a\r\nlarge percentage of the money which had created our vast Western railway\r\nsystem; she had found and made the superb copper-mines of Michigan and\r\nMontana, and in all parts of the land branches of her sturdy\r\ninstitutions were vitally assisting the miracle of America's\r\ndevelopment. Notwithstanding what these wide-flung enterprises imply of\r\ncommercial push and audacity, Boston, at the time Addicks discovered gas\r\nthere, was one of the most trusting wealth-investing communities in the\r\nworld. She had her simple rules of business conduct which years of\r\nusage had consecrated into all-powerful precedent, but her brokers and\r\ncapitalists, however fearful of all things quick or tricky, had never\r\npreviously figured as candidates for what in Western parlance are\r\ndescribed as \"come-ons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHOW ADDICKS CAPTURED BOSTON GAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time Addicks \"lit\" in Boston that city numbered among her\r\nproudest possessions several extremely rich gas companies, and they were\r\nowned by her \"best people.\" To do business with Boston's \"best people\"\r\nis no easy task, and up to the advent of Addicks, to do business with\r\nher \"best people\" without doing it through others of her \"best people\"\r\nwho could absolutely vouch for you was an unheard-of thing. The manner\r\nin which the ex-flour merchant of Philadelphia managed to slip by the\r\nbarriers and into the heart of our blue-blooded citadel affords the most\r\nunparalleled example of audacity of which I know.\r\n\r\nIn many ways Boston is unlike other great American cities. Some of her\r\ninstitutions through antiquity or association have acquired a positive\r\nsanctity. Pedigree is important. The average inhabitant spends much of\r\nhis time watching the grandson of his neighbor's father, to see the old\r\nman's characteristics crop out in him. The boy's failures will be\r\nremembered against his own offspring fifty years hence. It is a city of\r\nlong memories and of traditions. In 1887 Boston, as now, consisted\r\nlargely of her traditions, her blue-glass window-panes and her Somerset\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nNow the distinction, sanctity, and antiquity of the Somerset Club are\r\nquite beyond peradventure. Since Boston has been Boston she has had her\r\nSomerset Club, a club distinctively of grandfathers, fathers, and sons.\r\nThe right to membership in the Somerset Club is as much the inheritance\r\nof a Somerset man's son as his name or as the proud title which always\r\nwill be found affixed to his signature when he reaches man's estate, \"of\r\nBoston.\" For a man to get into the Somerset without long years of\r\nwaiting and intense scrutiny, not only of his own record but of his\r\nparents' before him, is a rare event. Yet the name of J. Edward\r\nO'Sullivan Addicks was up for full membership, with Boston's picked best\r\nfor his sponsors, a few days after he \"lit.\" How Addicks got upon the\r\nSomerset list Boston will never tell, and the mention of the fact\r\nnowadays within the club-house will empty its sideboard instanter.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of arrangement for the advent of Addicks in Boston was more\r\nelaborate, more astute and expensive than was ever organized for\r\nexploitation of prima donna or great pianist. For months an advance\r\nagent had been preparing the way for his chief's arrival in a blaze of\r\nglory. There was talk in the papers and among the financiers about the\r\nwonderful water-gas process which enormously enhanced the profits of\r\ngas-making, and such rumor was always linked with the name of the\r\nbrilliant Philadelphia Gas King, for so the press had already dubbed\r\nhim. A wonder and magic immensely provocative of curiosity were woven\r\nabout the identity of this J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, who it was said\r\nmight be persuaded to visit Boston to work marvels with the stocks that\r\nhad been \"in the family\" long before the present generation could\r\nremember. When it was sure that the great man was really coming the\r\nagent sought the advice of Boston's best in selecting quarters for him.\r\nIn the Tudor, a beautiful family hotel adjoining the Somerset Club on\r\nBeacon Hill, a magnificent suite of apartments was taken, and though the\r\ngreat man could remain in Boston but a brief space, the furniture, the\r\nhangings, and even the carpets were all changed for him.\r\n\r\nEminent financial tricksters have various ways of handling their\r\nvictims. Some believe that the most skilful mode of attack is the slow,\r\nconfident, dignified approach which allays the subject's fears by its\r\nsolemn display of deliberation. Others (and Addicks is of this creed)\r\nare persuaded of the superior efficacy of the \"rush-in-and-drag-out\"\r\nmethod. The subject, they say, \"gives up\" more and quicker when the\r\nhurry call is sounded. It was a winter's day when Addicks \"lit\" in\r\nBoston, and circumstances had arisen, the suave advance agent told\r\nvarious Boston's best, with whom he was in consultation, that would make\r\nhis chief's stay much briefer than either had anticipated. So when the\r\ngreat man arrived at the club just before dinner, quite an array of\r\nimportant people were congregated there.\r\n\r\nAddicks ran the gantlet of the critical glances of as critical a group\r\nas you'll find on earth, and the word went round--no one could remember\r\nafterward who started it--\"Typical Southern gentleman! Breeding sticking\r\nout everywhere!\" So well had the astute advance agent done his work that\r\na little dinner was arranged on the spot, and Addicks made such rapid\r\nprogress with these reserved and conservative Bostonians that, by the\r\ntime coffee was served, conversation had reached the stage where it was\r\nnatural for him to send the waiter to the coat-room for his bunch of gas\r\npapers. The emissary returned bringing the fur overcoat with which\r\nAddicks always envelops himself in chilly weather. Addicks searched the\r\npockets, and, apparently to his surprise, discovered that they did not\r\ncontain the required documents, but where they should have been he found\r\na small bale of 1,000-dollar government bonds, containing, one of the\r\nparty said afterward, at least one hundred certificates. \"How careless\r\nof my secretary!\" said Addicks, nonchalantly replacing the packet in the\r\npocket and motioning the waiter to take the overcoat away again.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, due to the admirable work of his advance agent that\r\nthese Monte Cristo effects impressed the cultured little set who would\r\nhave laughed to scorn such a display on the part of one of their own\r\nkind. In Addicks it was the dazzling eccentricity of the wonder-worker,\r\nand so excusable; and the free, flash, careless exhibit of wealth made\r\nthe man's conversation and subsequent demands seem natural. Next\r\nmorning, in discussing the work of the previous evening with his\r\nlieutenant, Addicks delivered himself of the wise remark: \"Finance, my\r\nboy, like theatricals, is dependent for success on the staging, more\r\neven than on the actor. My experience has shown me that men the world\r\nover are alike--if you properly surround them, they will hiss at hissing\r\ntime and clap at applauding time; yes, upon the way you stage your\r\nfinance plays depends their success.\" The fact is that by no other\r\nmethod could this scenic artist of finance have set his plans moving so\r\nrapidly. The man had calculated to a nicety on the romantic cupidity he\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Addicks at once \"got down to business\": \"Gentlemen, my\r\nproject is as simple as it is feasible and conservative, for I will\r\ntouch nothing but conservative enterprises. Gentlemen, you have three\r\ngreat gas companies supplying this great city with light, the Boston,\r\nRoxbury, and South Boston. They are worth at the present time about five\r\nmillion dollars. I am going to buy them and spend three or four millions\r\nmore on a new company; then I shall consolidate the four and turn them\r\nfrom coal into water-gas companies, which will sell gas to your people\r\nat less than they now pay, and at the same time make a lot of money for\r\nyou and for myself. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly quick action. Boston's best was breathless for a\r\nminute. Then some one suggested that in so weighty a matter it would be\r\nnecessary for solicitors to investigate, for the families owning the\r\nstock to be consulted and agree before a proper basis could be arrived\r\nat on which to dispose of their holdings.\r\n\r\nAddicks' genius was equal to the occasion. \"I regret, gentlemen, any\r\nseeming haste, but this is the situation: I am going to invest fifteen\r\nor twenty millions, or perhaps thirty or forty, in city gas properties,\r\nand as the project will require quite a bit of financiering, I have got\r\nto round it up at once, in time to slip over to London to lay it before\r\nmy associates, ----, ----, and ----\" (naming some of the great English\r\nlords of finance), \"with whom you, gentlemen, are probably well\r\nacquainted. I think you will, after you have given the matter a little\r\nthought, agree with me that it would be a mistake to postpone the\r\nconversion of these magnificent Boston plants to the water-gas system\r\nuntil after other cities I have in mind are reconstructed. You see we\r\ncan turn over but one city at a time, the system being new and competent\r\nengineers and builders few.\"\r\n\r\nThe painful thought took shape in the minds of the distinguished little\r\ngathering that if they were not careful, Monte Cristo might actually\r\nslip out of their town without working any of the promised golden\r\nmarvels.\r\n\r\n\"Just what is your idea, Mr. Addicks, of how this gigantic piece of\r\nbusiness could be done?\" one asked.\r\n\r\n\"Simple, simple\"--the great Colonel Sellers of eye-water fame never\r\nlooked more cool and unconcerned when calling attention to the facts,\r\n\"100,000,000 of people, two eyes each, a bottle of my patent eye-wash\r\nfor each at a dollar a bottle, and eye-wash made at a net cost of a dime\r\na barrel\"--\"simple, simple; you name your price, I pay it, and the thing\r\nis done.\"\r\n\r\nSome one pointed out that the gas properties were valued very high. That\r\nin the Boston, for instance, the par value of each share was $500--and\r\nthat it was improbable Mr. Addicks could buy it for less than--than\r\neight hundred.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course; I am not buying gas companies that are not well\r\nthought of by their present owners,\" returned Addicks. \"I think you\r\nunderestimate the value of the Boston Company's stock when you say $800.\r\nNaturally, as a conservative business man I wish to buy as reasonably as\r\npossible, but as I know what the future of your company will be under\r\nthe water-gas change, I consider $1,000 a share cheap; and if you say\r\nso, will take it now--majority, minority and all--at that price.\"\r\n\r\nThis was strong talk. In spite of their proverbial frigidness under all\r\nconditions, Boston's best began to get fidgety.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" went on the Monte Cristo from Philadelphia, \"I'll do better\r\nthan that. On second thought I will give you $1,200 a share. Think it\r\nover and we'll have another sit-down to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt took Addicks but a few days to trade, for at each sitting the staging\r\nwas more enticing and the call from his associates in London more\r\ninsistent. Minor difficulties were magnificently waved away. A number of\r\nscions of Boston's best families had good paying positions in the\r\ndifferent companies; what would Mr. Addicks do with them?\r\n\r\n\"Simple, simple,\" he replied; \"double the time of contract and the\r\nsalary; no favor to them or you; good men are very hard to get, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nOne episode that occurred about this time was allowed to get into print\r\nwhen the stocks and bonds were being floated, by way of showing what a\r\ntremendous fellow Addicks was. In a hired hack he had driven up to the\r\nclub from State Street. A snow-storm was raging. After Addicks had been\r\nin the club a few moments word was brought in to him that the driver had\r\nfound his sable overcoat inside the carriage. Addicks stepped into the\r\nvestibule to speak to the driver, and next day it was all over the\r\nclub-house and through the \"Street\" that the prodigal Philadelphian,\r\novercome at the thought of the unfortunate driver in his scanty clothing\r\nexposed to the cruel storm, had said: \"My good man, take that coat as a\r\npresent from me.\"\r\n\r\nFor the truth of the story I do not vouch, nor for that other which\r\nexplains that the door-boy who spread this tale of generosity said\r\nafterward, when discharged, that Addicks himself had told him what he\r\nhad done, and at the same time had given him a five-dollar bill. He\r\nwould have sworn the moment before that he heard Addicks tell the driver\r\nto take the coat to his apartments.\r\n\r\nAddicks got what he came to Boston for--the Boston, Roxbury, and South\r\nBoston Gas companies. He did what he said he would, built a new one, the\r\nBay State of Massachusetts, and turned them all into the Bay State of\r\nDelaware, and the Bay State of Delaware turned them out on the public in\r\nexchange for their savings to the extent of $19,000,000 in the form of\r\nbonds and stock. Addicks, to use his own language, \"cleaned up around\r\n$7,000,000,\" and turned to new fields, fields suited to his peculiar\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nAs he looked over the United States he found but one great city which\r\nhad not already been captured by \"Standard Oil\" or some of its\r\ndisciples--Brooklyn, N. Y. To the present day Rogers swears Addicks'\r\nonly reason for coming to Brooklyn was to hold up the \"Standard Oil\"\r\n\"trustification.\" Addicks retorts with: \"I saw it first.\" Whatever the\r\nfacts, in 1892 Rogers in the midst of tagging the different companies\r\nwas surprised and angered to find that Addicks had slipped in ahead and\r\nhad secured one of those necessary to the success of his plan. He\r\nquickly served notice on the man from Delaware to \"git,\" and Addicks,\r\nflushed with an unbroken chain of victories, as promptly returned the\r\nnotice with, scrawled across its face, a variation of Rogers' pet\r\nphrase--for it must be remembered Addicks never \"cusses\"--\"I'll see you\r\nin heaven first.\"\r\n\r\nIf there is any one time when Henry H. Rogers is quicker of action than\r\nany other, it is when his notice to \"git\" in a stock deal has been\r\nreturned with \"sass.\"\r\n\r\nThe ink was hardly dry on Addicks' answer before the Master of \"Standard\r\nOil\" and his hosts were upon him, but not where the Philadelphian looked\r\nfor them. While he awaited their attack in Brooklyn, N. Y., he received\r\na series of hurry-up calls from his lieutenants in Boston. Rogers had\r\nbought the insignificant Brookline Gas Company, which supplied gas to\r\none of the suburbs of Boston. It was only a $300,000 affair, but it\r\npossessed charter rights to come into any and all of the streets of\r\nBoston. This was a characteristic \"Standard Oil\" attack. It came out of\r\na clear sky, and before the public had even a warning of it they were\r\nwitnessing a war which looked as though it had been years in maturing.\r\nRogers let it become public knowledge that the entire \"Standard Oil\"\r\nforces were to be brought to bear to crush Addicks and that untold\r\nmillions would, if necessary, be spent in the effort. In reality he had\r\nmost carefully mapped out a cyclonic campaign which he believed would\r\nnot call for an expenditure of over $500,000, and which he was sure\r\nwould in a few months drive Addicks out of Brooklyn, N. Y., and bring\r\nhim to his knees in Boston. His fight began in earnest in 1894. Gas in\r\nBoston was $1.25 per thousand cubic feet, and the rate yielded a good\r\nprofit to the Addicks companies. Rogers served notice that he would\r\nparallel with the Brookline Company every pipe of the different Boston\r\ncompanies and would reduce the price of gas to $1. Simultaneously he\r\nattacked the Addicks stocks and bonds in the market, his charters in the\r\nLegislature, and took away from him the contracts to supply the\r\nmunicipality of Boston with gas. For a time Addicks struck back\r\nsavagely. Then, as the fight became hotter, he gave it up in Brooklyn,\r\nand concentrated all his resources on repelling the savage inroads\r\nRogers was making in Boston. By this time the contest had grown to such\r\nproportions and so much bad blood had been engendered that Rogers\r\ndeclined to be mollified by Addicks' surrender in Brooklyn and refused\r\nto retire from Boston unless Addicks repaid \"Standard Oil's\" entire\r\noutlay and got down on his knees in public--a demand that called forth\r\none of Addicks' sardonic smiles.\r\n\r\nAddicks had at this time additional difficulties to face. He had spread\r\nout his financial commitments, and now he found his stocks and bonds all\r\ndeclining. It was obvious to State and Wall streets that Rogers was in a\r\nfair way to drive the buccaneer from Philadelphia to the wall.\r\n\r\nIt is at this stage that I come into the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSTOCK-BROKERS NOT ALL BAD\r\n\r\n\r\nRight here, before plunging deeper into the current of events which led\r\nto the organization of Amalgamated--for what has gone before is only\r\nthat which I deem necessary setting for the story, necessary in order\r\nthat my readers may clearly take in its meaning--it is only fair to them\r\nand to myself for me to say that my life has been spent in the\r\nstock-market for the purpose of gain. I have never in my stock\r\noperations set myself up for a philanthropist nor in any way posed as a\r\nreformer, nor pretended to be a bit better than the business I had\r\nchosen for a livelihood. From the first day until now I have endeavored\r\nto keep strictly to the principle that I would never knowingly deceive\r\nany man, woman, or child who, out of confidence in me, risked their\r\nmoney in speculation or investment. At the same time it should be\r\nremembered that the stock-brokerage business often makes queer\r\nbedfellows. Moreover, the true stock-operator is sometimes tempted to\r\nbuckle on his armor and get into an exciting fight solely for the\r\ncombat's sake, and then he may not be over-concerned about the rights\r\nand wrongs of the contention, if upon both sides are lined up\r\nprofessional captains of finance. The minister, the college professor,\r\nthe dry-goods merchant, may exclaim against this, but they have never\r\nknown the delicious tingle which, since the abolition of the tournaments\r\nof old, can be felt only on the great financial battlefields. If the\r\ncritics of the stock-gambler could be put through a single minute of a\r\nthousand I have known they would be less brash in their denunciations.\r\nAnd let it be remembered that in these terrific dollar-wars there is as\r\nmuch opportunity for heroism, for generosity, for kindly deeds, as ever\r\nphysical fighting affords. I read here in the papers of the noble act\r\nof a captain in the navy who has taken his life in his hands; in another\r\nplace of a rich man who has given a million to create a charity. On the\r\nsame page that these men are eulogized I will find references to \"Jim\r\nKeene, the stock-gambler,\" etc., \"heartless, soulless stock-sharp,\" etc.\r\n\"Jim Keene, Stock-gambler,\" keeps no press agent to flaunt his kindly\r\nacts, but from the noble things I know he has done, and the things\r\nothers with whom I am personally acquainted know he has done--men,\r\nwomen, and children saved from misery, pain, and death, at the risk of\r\nruin to himself--I'll warrant the celestial scroll shows to his record\r\nas many deeds of mercy and noble daring as are credited to any soldier\r\nor philanthropist who has achieved worldly fame in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe desire for sudden wealth is strong in all parts of our American\r\ncommunity. Men want money, and women too, for a score of reasons--some\r\ngood, some bad--and the stock-market is the magical place where miracles\r\noccur and dollars multiply themselves overnight. The agent for all the\r\ncupidity of the world is the stock-broker, and he sees life from a\r\nstrange angle.\r\n\r\nHundreds of letters come to me daily from all kinds of people, who have\r\nno other call upon me than their belief that, having at some previous\r\ntime profitably followed my advice or advice credited to me, they have a\r\nright, when \"the papers say\" I am doing or going to do this, that, or\r\nthe other thing in stocks, to come to me with their troubles. In 1899\r\nthere reached me from a woman a picture of her husband, herself, her\r\nthree children, and the aged father and mother of her husband. I wish I\r\nmight print it, but I dare not through fear that they would be\r\nrecognized. The letter accompanying it was one of the most touchingly\r\npathetic I have ever read. I investigated the case. The statements made\r\nwere absolutely true. The woman's husband was the cashier of one of the\r\nsmall national banks in one of the old towns in a New England State. His\r\nfather's brother had been cashier before him. The family's past was\r\nthickly strewn with all those simple honors and good things which are so\r\noften the heritage of families of the old, self-respecting,\r\nGod-fearing, middle-class communities of New England and like\r\nlong-settled sections of the country. On his death-bed the uncle\r\nconfessed that for years he had carried upon the books of the bank a\r\nshortage which had arisen from mistakes. Her husband, to keep the\r\nfamily's name from stain, had continued to keep this buried, which was\r\nan easy thing to do, as when he was moved up from teller to cashier at\r\nhis uncle's death the two positions were combined into one. The wife\r\nexplained that her husband had let her into the fearful secret, and\r\ntogether they had carried it until it had eaten its way into their\r\nhearts. At last the man could no longer stand the strain. He had\r\nfollowed my printed sayings about the market, and now had made the fatal\r\nplunge. He had bought upon margin 2,000 shares of Sugar stock to see if\r\nit were not possible to make up quickly a shortage of over $20,000,\r\nbecause I had said Sugar was going right up; and then horror of worse\r\nthan death had seized the wife and she had given me the awful secret,\r\nand a description, a word picture of what would happen if I had made a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nShe could go no further. She did not need to. I read the letter. I saw\r\nthe picture, and even I, who believed myself from long years of\r\nexperience with such affairs immune--I, too, became horror-stricken. It\r\nwas no affair of mine. I had not said Sugar was going up; as is often\r\nthe case, some newspaper had printed what another operator had said and\r\ncredited it to me. I was not even operating in Sugar, nor at the time\r\nparticularly interested in it. I could not return the letter nor have\r\nany communication with these persons without in a way becoming their\r\naccomplice. The woman had said that with the purchase her husband had\r\ngiven orders to sell the stocks at twelve points' rise.\r\n\r\nTry as I might to look at the matter in a cold-blooded business way the\r\npicture haunted me--the old gentleman proud of his family's long record\r\nof sturdy honesty, the old mother's faith in her boy, the wife seeing on\r\neach of her children the brand of a felon father, and the husband\r\nwatching each day's market prices to see whether they had brought him a\r\nverdict which meant State's prison or permanent relief from the\r\nhaunting fear which had become his never-absent shadow; and I read and\r\nreread the closing lines of the faithful wife: \"Mr. Lawson, you will put\r\nSugar up?--you surely will, just this once--and we will teach the\r\nchildren to pray for you and yours, and God answers this kind of\r\nprayers, you know He does.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture haunted me; I saw it in the market prices; I heard the story\r\nin each tick of the ticker and each rustle of the tape; and every time\r\nmy eye caught \"SUG,\" the stock-exchange abbreviation for Sugar, I\r\nwinced, as one does at the dentist's probe--well, I could not stand it.\r\nI determined to put up Sugar--that is, I determined to try. Little the\r\nwoman knew what she asked when she wrote: \"You will put up Sugar?\" She\r\nhad read that a stock operator works magic, but it had never entered her\r\nhead that his wand was a stick of dynamite a thousand times\r\nconcentrated--a stick of dynamite that the law of stock-market averages\r\nshows goes off in his hand nine out of every ten times it is handled,\r\nand that when it goes off there is nothing more for the handler but the\r\nminister, the flowers, and the head-stone; indeed, often the explosion\r\nleaves nothing with which to buy even a head-stone! Little she thought\r\nthat it might strain the wealth of the Bank of England to move Sugar up\r\ntwelve points. I moved it up, and it went so easy--oh, so easy!\r\nthat--well, I will let the first description I pick from my scrap-book\r\nfrom among a hundred from the daily press tell the story:\r\n\r\n     [From the _Boston Journal_, March 17, 1899]\r\n\r\n     LAWSON'S LUMP\r\n\r\n     HIS COFFEE SWEETENED WITH QUARTER OF A MILLION--MADE IT IN\r\n     SUGAR THURSDAY IN TWO HOURS' TRADING\r\n\r\n     A quarter of a million in a day!\r\n\r\n     That was Thomas W. Lawson's record for March 16, 1899.\r\n\r\n     The celebrated \"Unthroned King of State Street\" was on top\r\n     of the Sugar market; that is the reason of it all.\r\n\r\n     Sugar was the big card of stock speculation yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Indeed, the stock had one of the wildest days in its\r\n     history, and its high price--$170--reached amid great\r\n     excitement--is the highest on record. The speculation was\r\n     something tremendous, and it has been through the\r\n     speculation that the people who have been under the\r\n     impression that the markets were drifting into a dull and\r\n     uninteresting condition have had a sudden awakening.\r\n\r\n     From the opening it quickly advanced to 149, receded a point\r\n     or more, and shortly after noon started sharply upward. The\r\n     demand for it came so rapidly that the tape could not keep\r\n     up with it, and the excitement grew as the demand increased.\r\n     The scenes on the floors of both the New York and local\r\n     boards were most exciting. Blocks of 500 and 1,000 shares\r\n     changed hands frequently, and at one time the quotation in\r\n     the Boston market was fully four points behind that of the\r\n     New York list. The small army of shorts scrambled to get\r\n     covered up, and everybody was in a fever of wild excitement\r\n     over the marvellous movement. Before it had culminated the\r\n     price reached 170, or a gain of twenty-nine points over the\r\n     opening--the most remarkable display of strength in so short\r\n     a period of time that this remarkable stock has ever shown.\r\n\r\n     Broker Lawson did the buying, and while the excitement was\r\n     running high he bought freely. He had taken 20,000 shares\r\n     all told before the advance had fairly gotten under way at\r\n     from 143-1/2 to 144. At 170 he gave an order to sell 20,000\r\n     shares at a limit of 155, and obtained an average of over\r\n     160, thereby netting an estimated snug profit of $250,000 or\r\n     more within two hours. Asked as to whether the strength in\r\n     Sugar meant a settlement of the Sugar war, Mr. Lawson smiled\r\n     and said: \"There has never been any Sugar war.\"\r\n\r\n     The conservative people on the Street are disposed to regard\r\n     the whole movement as a piece of clever manipulation.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [From the _Boston Herald_, March 16, 1899]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Thomas W. Lawson was the mover in the deal, and his\r\n     orders for 20,000 shares early in the day excited other\r\n     buying, which encompassed the astonishing rise. What point\r\n     Mr. Lawson had to trade upon is his own asset, if he had any\r\n     point, and it would not matter so far as the event was\r\n     concerned whether he had a point. The market was in a\r\n     position to respond to orders of these dimensions, and it\r\n     did respond.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [From the _New York Journal_, March 17, 1899]\r\n\r\n     The frenzied brokers fought like madmen around the Sugar\r\n     post. The wildest sort of excitement prevailed throughout\r\n     the day. The rest of the floor was practically abandoned,\r\n     and brokers crowded, pushed, elbowed, and yelled frantically\r\n     in their efforts to fill orders. There was no warning. The\r\n     sudden jump of the stock almost threw the brokers into a\r\n     panic. Men became ferocious in their efforts to fill orders.\r\n     Those on the outside made wild rushes to get into the\r\n     whirlpool. Men who are generally calm fell over each other\r\n     in their excitement. Scores of arms whipped the air, and men\r\n     yelled themselves hoarse. So great was the din and so\r\n     compact the yelling crowd that those on one side of the post\r\n     did not know the bidding on the other. At one point Sugar\r\n     was going at 159, and five feet away it was bringing 164.\r\n     While almost at arm's-length farther away it was going at\r\n     160, and farther around the post at 162.\r\n\r\n     The excitement became general among the offices of\r\n     stock-brokers as the news flew on the ticker. Members of\r\n     firms who were not on the floor gathered about the tickers\r\n     in excited groups and watched the pyrotechnic fluctuations\r\n     of Sugar to the exclusion of all other stocks. The\r\n     quotations came out at two and three points apart. One\r\n     minute the stock was away up, and the next it seemed to fall\r\n     hopelessly. Then it would as suddenly soar upward again. It\r\n     reached 170, and in five minutes it was down to 152.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [From the _Boston Post_, March 22, 1899]\r\n\r\n     Late in the afternoon Mr. Lawson was induced to give the\r\n     following explanation of his movements in Sugar: \"You know\r\n     it is not conducive to the health of an active operator to\r\n     talk on what he is doing, for if he expects to retain his\r\n     hirsute adornment he must either keep jumping so lively that\r\n     none of the expert scalpers who haunt the jungles of Wall\r\n     Street can find him long enough in one spot to cut the floor\r\n     from under him, or he must envelop himself in mystery so\r\n     dense that all seeking for him will grow color-blind; but on\r\n     this particular commodity--Sugar--I can depart from the\r\n     standard formula.\r\n\r\n     \"I have been twenty-nine years dodging the scalping-knives\r\n     of Wall Street Comanches, and, although I am still here, I\r\n     have many places on my head where the hair refuses to grow,\r\n     and, strange to tell, almost all the bare spots are labelled\r\n     'Sugar.' I suppose that I have, during the past ten years,\r\n     contributed money enough to Sugar to endow a fair-sized\r\n     asylum for tailless bears. It has never seemed to matter\r\n     whether I bought or sold, went long or short, the dollars\r\n     which I secured by the employment of pick and shovel, brawn,\r\n     muscle or gray matter, all seemed to follow one another into\r\n     the relentless maw of that modern Saccharine Titanotherium.\r\n\r\n     \"Way back in 1890 I invested the profits of my Lamson\r\n     deal--$700,000--in 10,000 Sugar at 84, and in a few days,\r\n     amid brilliant fireworks, I bade it adieu, when it\r\n     gracefully dropped below 50. Again, four years ago, I\r\n     decided I could make no better long-time investment of\r\n     $700,000 or $800,000 Electric profits than to short Sugar\r\n     from 61 to 70. In eleven days it took $1,500 more than my\r\n     profits to even up my accounts.\r\n\r\n     \"Thinking these things over of late, I determined to make a\r\n     final demand on astute and relentless Wall Street for my\r\n     accumulated deposits--a kind of\r\n     please-give-me-back-my-losses demand. I carefully loaded up\r\n     two weeks ago to the extent of 20,000 Sugar in the thirties,\r\n     and feeling the atmosphere was redolent of opportunities,\r\n     last Friday I bought 20,000 more, the last 5,000 of which in\r\n     a rather open and frank way that seemed but fair to my\r\n     scalping New York friends. Well, you know the rest. It took\r\n     fire. I cleaned up something over $700,000, and put out a\r\n     short line of 30,000 shares, the last of which I have\r\n     covered to-day at something over $350,000 profit. Strange as\r\n     it may seem, I was quit. I have struck a balance with Sugar,\r\n     and it gets no more of my money.\r\n\r\n     \"I am one of the few Bostonians who are contented to live in\r\n     the knowledge that Wall Street is too big and bright and\r\n     cute a metropolitan centre for country boys to monkey with,\r\n     and you can say I am so tickled to get back my bait that I\r\n     will never again, never, wander away from home. There is one\r\n     moral that may be drawn by Wall and State streets from the\r\n     last few days in Sugar. It is this: It is not necessary\r\n     to-day, any more than it was in old days, to work deals with\r\n     false stories or fakes. In doing what I did in Sugar I\r\n     depended on no fakes nor stories. I simply followed Charley\r\n     Osborne's old admonition: 'If you want to bull stocks, buy\r\n     'em. If you want to bear 'em, sell 'em.' I bought 'em and I\r\n     sold 'em. These are Sugar facts as far as my movements have\r\n     affected them!\"\r\n\r\nFor years after, even up to to-day, this yarn turned up in the press in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, and every time I read it I chuckled to\r\nmyself, for I see a big manly fellow, president of a bank now and asking\r\nno odds of any, for he can buy 2,000 shares of Sugar at any time and\r\ndraw his check to pay for it against a bank account honestly earned\r\nsince the day his wife wrote that letter.\r\n\r\nAnd I see a grateful mother teaching three youths to say a certain\r\nprayer, and then I forget the critics' scathing sermons against stock\r\ngamblers. It does not pain me when my own children ask, \"Why do they say\r\nsuch awful things about the stock operator?\" I answer: \"Oh, they mean no\r\nharm; they don't know the stock gambler they write about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE SYSTEM'S SHADOWS\r\n\r\nThat my readers may not drop this chapter with a false idea of the\r\nresults of the stock-broker's efforts to \"live and let live,\" I will\r\ngive them an illustration of one of the counterbalances of the law of\r\ncompensations.\r\n\r\nIn the same year with the Sugar transaction, in an evil moment my mail\r\nbrought me the following letter:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I have read with interest your proclamations\r\n     about \"Coppers.\" I am not a rich man, but I have about\r\n     $20,000 lying idle which I should like to add to, and will\r\n     put it into anything you advise.\r\n\r\nThe writer received the following answer from my secretary:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson instructs me to say he received your letter of\r\n     ---- and he knows no better investment than the stock of the\r\n     Amalgamated Copper Company, which will be offered for public\r\n     subscription next week. In the advertising which will\r\n     accompany the offer you will note that it is to pay 8 per\r\n     cent., is now earning 16, and should sell at $150 or $200\r\n     per share. It will be offered at par. Not only does Mr.\r\n     Lawson personally believe in every word in the\r\n     advertisements, but they are vouched for by such men and\r\n     institutions as the National City Bank of New York, Henry H.\r\n     Rogers, William Rockefeller and others, whose names are\r\n     synonymous with success in business affairs. Mr. Lawson does\r\n     not hesitate to advise you to invest your $20,000 in this\r\n     stock, provided you are not looking for an investment that\r\n     is absolutely safe, that is, one that should not, in these\r\n     times, pay you over 3-3/4 or 4 per cent.; but if you are\r\n     looking for a semi-speculative investment, that is, one that\r\n     will pay you over 6 per cent., and where the chances are\r\n     good for large profits, he recommends this stock.\r\n\r\nLater I received the following:\r\n\r\n     Upon your advice I purchased 200 shares of the Amalgamated\r\n     stock at $100 per share. When the stock dropped to 80,\r\n     remembering your strong advice I purchased 300 shares more,\r\n     and after it had advanced to 120, thinking it was surely\r\n     going to the 150 or 200 you mentioned, I bought 1,000,\r\n     putting up my 500 shares as margin. It has now dropped back\r\n     to 100, and the many stories I read in the papers are\r\n     causing me much anxiety. Do you still believe as you first\r\n     wrote me?\r\n\r\nTo which he received the following answer:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson instructs me to say he received yours of ----.\r\n     His faith in the Amalgamated property, the men who control\r\n     and manage it, and the stock is the same as it always has\r\n     been. He, like yourself, added to his holdings at 120, and\r\n     as high as 129, and knowing what he does about the property,\r\n     and what the men who control and manage it, and with whom he\r\n     is intimately associated, say to him, he cannot believe the\r\n     yarns which are appearing in the press are other than the\r\n     vaporings of those stock-market critics who must write their\r\n     opinions of prominent stocks even though they have no means\r\n     of actually knowing anything about them.\r\n\r\n     While Mr. Lawson regrets that you have spread yourself out,\r\n     as you say in your letter, he can only answer your question\r\n     by the above, to wit, his faith in Amalgamated is the same\r\n     as from the beginning.\r\n\r\nLater I received the following from one of the penal institutions of the\r\ncountry:\r\n\r\n     You will observe by the postmark on this letter my present\r\n     place of residence. You probably knew that before, as the\r\n     press has had much to say about me of late.\r\n\r\n     I trust you and your associates are satisfied with\r\n     yourselves when you observe the hell you have caused others.\r\n     When I first wrote you about the Amalgamated stock I was an\r\n     honest, prosperous man. I had never committed a crime nor\r\n     done any great wrong to my fellow-beings. Relying upon what\r\n     you said publicly and the well-known record of the\r\n     Rockefellers and their partners, I committed acts which I\r\n     now know to my everlasting sorrow I should not have\r\n     committed. I had no intention of doing wrong, but when I saw\r\n     ruin staring me in the face I used, as I supposed only\r\n     temporarily, funds intrusted to me to protect my stocks from\r\n     being slaughtered at declining prices by the sharks of\r\n     brokers whom I dealt with. The rest is the old story. My\r\n     wife and children are disgraced and oppressed with poverty,\r\n     and I am serving a five years' sentence in this institution,\r\n     buoyed up only with the hope that I may live to face you and\r\n     your kind, that you may have the pleasure of seeing the\r\n     wreck you have wrought--in the hope that I may satisfy a\r\n     desire which night and day gnaws at my very soul, a desire\r\n     to say to you, face to face: \"Look upon a man who, although\r\n     a branded criminal, is as much better than you and your\r\n     associates as it is possible for one to be,\" and to ask you\r\n     how your wife and your children enjoy the luxuries they have\r\n     when they know at what price they were secured, for I shall\r\n     surely, if I live, insist upon your wife and children\r\n     hearing from my lips what agonies a wife and children, who\r\n     are as dear to me as yours are to you, have suffered because\r\n     of your baseness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE \"SYSTEM\" VERSUS WESTINGHOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1894 I had just wound up one of the most strenuous and successful\r\nfinancial campaigns I ever engaged in. This was the Westinghouse deal,\r\nof which the papers were full at the time. George Westinghouse, to whom\r\nthe world owes the air-brake and countless improvements in electrical\r\nmachinery, having surmounted the difficulties that clog the early steps\r\nof the inventor who would be his own master, had taken rank, some years\r\nbefore, among the prominent public figures of the day. The various\r\ncorporations in America bearing his name had prospered amazingly; his\r\ningenious appliances had displaced home products in the European market;\r\nand titles and decorations had been conferred on the inventor, though\r\nthese last, like the sturdy American he is, Westinghouse had put aside.\r\n\r\nThis great success was wholly the fruit of George Westinghouse's\r\npersonal endeavor. It owed nothing to extraneous influences. It had been\r\naccomplished along those manly, independent, Yankee lines which have\r\nmade that name synonymous with hustle and success in every part of the\r\ncivilized world. Above all, the man had organized and developed his\r\ncompanies without the aid of the \"System\" or without truckling to its\r\nvotaries. In consequence he had incurred the deadly hatred of some of\r\nits lords paramount.\r\n\r\nIn the business world Westinghouse's great rival was the General Electric\r\nCompany. To mention \"Westinghouse\" and \"General Electric\" in the same\r\nbreath was to speak of a thing and its antithesis. Everything George\r\nWestinghouse was or had been the General Electric was not and had never\r\nbeen. The General Electric had been and was by leave of the \"System\"; in\r\nfact, was one of the very foremost examples of its methods. Its\r\nhigh-priest was J. Pierpont Morgan; its home, Wall Street; its owners, the\r\nprincipal votaries of the \"System.\" It had grown because of their favor\r\nand by means of the rankest exhibitions of knock-down-and-drag-out methods\r\nof consolidation of all competitors but--Westinghouse.\r\n\r\nJust previous to 1894 Westinghouse had rejected a dazzling scheme of\r\nuniting the two institutions on an immense capitalization which would\r\nhave absorbed millions and millions of the people's savings and earned\r\nmillions in commissions for its projectors. Wall Street's indignation at\r\nhis hardihood knew no bounds, and at the time of which I write the\r\nyegg-men of the \"System\" were laying for him with dark-lantern and\r\nsand-bag.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the story of what the \"System\" tried to do to George\r\nWestinghouse and what he withstood, one must know the man. He embodies\r\nin many ways the conception of what the ideal American should be. His\r\nremarkable six feet and odd of physique and his fertile, powerful brain\r\nare the admiration of all true men with whom he comes in contact. In\r\nspite of his unparalleled success and the accumulation of a great\r\nfortune, he retains the same simplicity of manner and conduct that\r\ncharacterized him when working at the bench for weekly wages, and with\r\nall his shrewdness and force of character he has preserved a simple,\r\nhonest, childlike belief in humanity. Single-handed he conducted all his\r\ngreat enterprises on a plain, patriarchal basis, using their revenues\r\nfor extensions, and depending on his faithful and well-satisfied\r\nstockholders for such further accessions of capital as the business\r\nmight in his judgment need. About the time General Electric was most\r\nanxious to bolster up its jerry-built structure with the solid\r\nWestinghouse concern, the latter institution had begun the erection of\r\nsome big new plants which required immediately several millions\r\nadditional capital. Westinghouse prepared to apply to his stockholders\r\nfor the required funds, and the announcement was to be made at the\r\nannual election soon due. Suddenly the financial sky became overcast.\r\nThe stock-market grew panicky and money as scare in Wall Street as rain\r\nin Arizona in May. It was just such a situation as the \"System\" might\r\nhave brought about to accomplish its fell designs had it possessed the\r\npower to work miracles.\r\n\r\nAnd the \"System\" took care of its advantage. At a tense moment in that\r\nsoul and nerve trying period, with Wall and State streets full of talk\r\nabout General Electric's probable absorption of Westinghouse, General\r\nElectric being then at its highest price, $119 per share, the Westinghouse\r\ncompanies held their annual meetings and the big inventor, confidently\r\nfacing his stockholders, quite regardless of conditions which he thought\r\ncould have no possible bearing on his concern's splendid prospects, came\r\nforward with his demand for the millions required to complete the projects\r\nalready under way. This was the signal. From all the stock-market\r\nsub-cellars and rat-holes of State, Broad, and Wall streets crept those\r\nwriggling, slimy snakes of bastard rumors which, seemingly fatherless and\r\nmotherless, have in reality multi-parents who beget them with a deviltry\r\nof intention: \"George Westinghouse had mismanaged his companies\"; \"George\r\nWestinghouse, because of gross extravagance, had spread himself and his\r\ncompanies until they were involved beyond extrication unless by\r\nconsolidation with General Electric\"; these and many more seeped through\r\nthe financial haunts of Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, and kept hot\r\nthe wires into every financial centre in America and Europe, where aid\r\nmust be sought to relieve the crisis. There came a crash in Westinghouse\r\nstocks, and their price melted. From amidst the thunder and lowering\r\nclouds emerged the \"System.\" \"Notwithstanding the black eye the name of\r\neverything Westinghouse had received, it would stand by and consolidate\r\nand save the day!\" But the \"System\" and its everything-gauged-by-machinery\r\nvotaries had reckoned without their host. George Westinghouse was too\r\nstrong a man to be thus easily shaken down. He threw back his mighty\r\nshoulders, shook his big head, and flung his great private fortune into\r\nthe market to stay the falling prices of his securities. The movement was\r\ntoo strong against him at the moment, and his millions were but a\r\ntemporary help. He got on the firing-line himself and did a thousand and\r\none things that only a brave, honest, and democratic Yankee would or could\r\ndo--everything but accept the cunning aid offered him by the \"System\" or\r\nits votaries. He knew too well that the friendly mask concealed a foe and\r\nthat the kid-gloved hand extended him had a dagger up its sleeve.\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions when I, as an expert in stock-market affairs,\r\nwas called in for assistance. Here was this sound, sturdy institution\r\nstanding for everything that was best and self-supporting in American\r\nfinance adrift on the Wall Street shoals, and it seemed almost a\r\nhopeless task to attempt its rescue. But it was a task eminently worth\r\nwhile, and I undertook it with all the energy I could command.\r\n\r\nThe problem was to restore the Westinghouse stocks to their former high\r\nprice, and, confidence being re-established, to sell the new treasury\r\nstock at such a figure as would pay for the plants and other projects\r\nthe company had under way. The completion of these meant greatly\r\nincreased earnings and such an advance in facilities and economy of\r\nmanufacture as would surely seal the fate of General Electric if it\r\ncompeted with Westinghouse under the new conditions. Small wonder\r\n\"Standard Oil's\" whole strength was bent to force the alliance.\r\n\r\nMy fight had hardly begun when I saw it was to be opposed by all the\r\nforces of General Electric and the \"System,\" and I concluded defeat was\r\nsure unless by a counter movement on their stock I could keep them so\r\nbusy that they would have no time to interfere with Westinghouse.\r\nThereupon I laid out that attack on everything connected with General\r\nElectric which created so much consternation at the time. To this day,\r\nif my enemies are asked to name the act which most conclusively\r\njustifies their hatred of me, they will point to my terrible General\r\nElectric raid. They will tell you I broke the stock from 118 to 56 in a\r\nday, and thereby caused one of our most disastrous panics; that I\r\ncontinued to hammer it to 20, that I compelled reorganization, and then\r\ndid not let up. They will show you that the misery and ruin I wrought\r\nwere beyond calculation. I will only say that, of any of the things I am\r\nproud of having done, I am proudest of what I did in General Electric,\r\nand, willingly, I would give over five years of my life to go through\r\nthe experience again.\r\n\r\nIt was a most arduous campaign, and our fate trembled many times in the\r\nbalance. By dint of hard, overtime work, and what my enemies were\r\npleased to call rank manipulation, we drove Westinghouse stock back to\r\nits former price, after which a strong syndicate was formed to take the\r\nnew stock, and the righted institution at once magnificently swept on\r\nits international career which to-day is at its height.\r\n\r\nThough I had taken up the Westinghouse cause as a business venture and\r\nits successful termination was most profitable to me, I had entered into\r\nthe campaign with the ardor of a lawyer defending a client unjustly\r\naccused of a heinous crime. But there was this difference--if in spite\r\nof his efforts the lawyer fails to convince the jury of his client's\r\ninnocence it means no detriment to his fortune or his reputation,\r\nwhereas all I had and was were involved in this stock-exchange struggle.\r\nThe great rewards that are the guerdon of success in financial fights\r\nare balanced by the terrific consequences of defeat. The broker general\r\nengaged in surrounding his enemy requires every dollar he and his\r\nprincipals can pledge or beg, and where great forces are in conflict\r\nmillions are burnt up to seize any vantage, as Kuroki sacrifices a\r\nregiment to gain a hill. I had won for myself as well as for\r\nWestinghouse, but if the fortunes of the war had been on the other side,\r\nI must certainly have been wiped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE ALLIANCE WITH ADDICKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was part of my method of conducting my stock-brokerage business to\r\nexpose through the medium of the press or through market letters the\r\nstocks of corporations I thought rotten. It was also my way to work up\r\nbull campaigns in stocks that seemed to be selling for less than they\r\nwere worth. With Addicks or the \"Standard Oil\" I had no connection. I\r\nhad watched the Philadelphian's operations and had my eye marketwise on\r\nhis bonds and stock, particularly on his stock, which was 100,000 shares\r\nof the Bay State Gas Company of Delaware, of a par value of fifty\r\ndollars each, and which became very active in the market shortly after\r\nit was created, at just under par. I thought I saw in the scheme the\r\nordinary, cold-blooded, stock-jobbing, unloading-on-the-public affair. I\r\nhad heard recounted the man's wonderful doings, particularly his\r\nrecklessness in the purchase of the Boston companies; I \"sized up\" his\r\nmighty effort to be the tremendously rich good fellow as inspired by the\r\nidea and the purpose of giving his \"stuff\" in the stock-market a good\r\nsend-off; and from the start I had put his property on my \"to-be-watched\r\nmemoranda\" as one I might at the proper time let daylight into.\r\n\r\nI was tearing large strips from its values when Addicks' bankers, who\r\nhappened to be business friends of mine, sought to enlist me on their\r\nside of the gas war. I remember expressing frankly my opinion about the\r\ncontestants and their contest at the time, stating that so far as\r\nmorality, fairness, or justice went I could see little to choose between\r\nAddicks and \"Standard Oil.\" I continued to \"bear\" the stock until one\r\nday my banker friends brought me an earnest request from the Delaware\r\nfinancier that I go to New York and talk things over with him.\r\n\r\nOn reaching New York--the two bankers and myself--we went directly to\r\nAddicks' apartments at the Imperial Hotel. Although the fortunes of war\r\nwere rapidly crumbling this worthy's brilliant financial structure,\r\nthere were as yet no outward signs of disintegration. His beautiful\r\nestate at Claymont, Del., his stock farm in the same State, his\r\ntown-house in Philadelphia, his $30,000 apartments in the Knickerbocker\r\non Fifth Avenue in New York, and the superbly furnished suite in the\r\nImperial, close by, all seemed to testify to the man's boundless\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nMemorable though this meeting was destined to be to both of us, my chief\r\nsensation in approaching it was a certain curiosity as to the\r\npersonality of Addicks, whom I had seen, but had never spoken to. I knew\r\nhim to a \"T\" in my mind, but here was my opportunity to compare my\r\nmental \"sizing-up\" with the real man. The apartment into which we were\r\nushered was of the low-burning-red-light, Turkish pattern. Addicks rose\r\nfrom a great divan disturbing a pose which his white cricket-cloth suit\r\nand the scarlet shadows made so stagy that I guessed it was for my\r\nbenefit. I looked him over, and he returned the inspection. After the\r\nintroduction he at once unlimbered his business gun.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get right down to business, Lawson,\" he began. \"I wanted to meet\r\nyou to see if we could get together on any satisfactory basis.\"\r\n\r\nI told him that that was my understanding of our meeting. Then he wanted\r\nassurances that I had no connections with \"Standard Oil\" and that I was\r\nfree, sentimentally and commercially, to enlist in his fight. I replied\r\nthat I was a stock-broker and operator, and was looking for\r\nopportunities; no one had strings on me, and provided he made\r\nsatisfactory terms I was free to join him; further, that when it came to\r\nenlisting in a fight between two such financiers as Addicks and Rogers,\r\nsentiment seemed to me out of place.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"That's what I like to hear. Now, Lawson, will\r\nyou take this fight of mine against 'Standard Oil'?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you meet my terms, yes.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks looked at me. \"What do you want?\" he asked. \"Perhaps, though,\r\nyou'd first like to have me tell you how my affairs stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know sufficiently where you stand,\" I replied, \"to name my terms\r\nright now. If they are acceptable, I'll hear you tell where you stand\r\nafterward. I'll take your fight for a cash commission of $250,000 and a\r\ncash capital of $1,000,000, to be used in the market on joint account,\r\nwe to divide the profits of all operations.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks smiled. \"You are too high,\" he said. \"I'll pay you $50,000\r\ncommission and give you $250,000 capital, and after I show you in what\r\ngood shape my fight now is and how near I am to victory, you'll agree\r\nthat the terms I offer are good pay and fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Addicks,\" said I, \"I have just time to get dinner, look in at the\r\ntheatre, and catch the midnight back to Boston. It is my business to\r\nkeep posted on such scrimmages as you are engaged in. If you and your\r\naffairs are where I believe they are, the terms I offer are\r\nexceptionally low. If your affairs are as you would have me believe, you\r\nneed no one to captain your fight.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks asked where I thought his affairs stood, and I answered: \"I\r\ndon't think--I know, or, at least, I feel quite sure I do. You are at\r\nthe end of your rope and are practically bankrupt.\"\r\n\r\nAt once Addicks grew indignant. \"You are absolutely wrong,\" he asserted.\r\n\"I'll admit I have had a hard fight, and that it has cost me, so far,\r\nconsiderable money; but I give you my word I'm worth between six and\r\nseven millions clear and clean right now.\"\r\n\r\nI bade him good-night and left. Our interview had consumed not over\r\ntwenty to twenty-five minutes. I said to his bankers:\r\n\r\n\"Addicks is the Addicks I have sized him up to be, only worse.\"\r\n\r\nWe got back to Boston next morning, and at the opening of the Stock\r\nExchange I sailed into the Bay State stock in earnest, for I felt surer\r\nthan before that Addicks was nearing his finish. A few minutes after\r\nthe Exchange opened, Addicks' banker rushed into my office and said the\r\nDelaware financier begged that I would return to New York at once, and\r\nwhispered to me that in a conversation just held on the telephone\r\nAddicks had stated that he would accept my terms. I informed the banker\r\nI was not anxious for the job, but as he urged his own interest, I\r\njumped on the noon train and in the evening was again in New York.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm day and I was pleased to get a wire on the train from\r\nAddicks asking me to meet him at the pier, as we should hold our\r\nconference on his yacht, the _Now-Then_, at that time one of the fastest\r\nsteam-yachts afloat.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of memorable beauty. In the golden light of a dazzling\r\nsunset we flew up the majestic Hudson. From under the awning I watched\r\nthe serried edges of the Palisades as we slipped swiftly by them to the\r\nbroad reaches of tinted waters above Yonkers. Every natural influence\r\nconspired to make acute to me the warning whisper of my soul, which\r\nflashed the caution as I crossed the gang-plank, \"Watch out!\" But, as I\r\nsaid before, Fate hangs no red lights at the cross-roads of a man's\r\ncareer, and I plunged recklessly into the toils my Mephistophelian\r\ncompanion so artfully wove around me.\r\n\r\nThe _Now-Then_ was hardly in mid-stream before Addicks had got down to\r\nbusiness. His demeanor had changed since the previous evening. All his\r\nbravado had disappeared; he was simple, frank, direct, and, in the\r\nmanner of one who has made a mistake and regrets it, he commenced\r\nwithout any delay:\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think last night I'd pay your price, Lawson. It staggered me a\r\nbit, but I gave it considerable thought after you left, and when this\r\nmorning's prices showed me you were again on the war-path, I saw my\r\nerror.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Addicks,\" said I, \"let's have no fooling about this matter. If we\r\ndo business together, it will only be after there is some\r\nplain--brutally plain talk between us. It will do no good to trick,\r\nbecause some one will get slaughtered when the trickery is discovered,\r\nas it surely would be, after we hitched up together.\"\r\n\r\nThen, straight from the shoulder, free from all attempt to gloss over\r\nthe raw truth, I detailed to him the things I knew he had done to his\r\nformer associates, and it was a tale of unbroken duplicity and\r\ndouble-dealing on his part, loss and misery for his lieutenants, and\r\nprofits and curses for him. I ended by saying: \"If we get together,\r\nAddicks, it will be upon my terms, and I'll see to it that you never put\r\nme in the position in which you have put all the others you've been\r\nconnected with. I don't trust you and I'll watch you all the time.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished Addicks looked at me sadly with a wounded,\r\n\"how-this-man-has misjudged-me\" expression in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"you were never more mistaken in your life, but it's\r\na matter I don't want to argue about. You'll tell me you were all wrong\r\nafter you know me better. I'll do business with you--yes, and I'll allow\r\nyou to make your own terms. I'll agree to them whatever they are, and\r\nI'll live up to the very letter of them, however hard.\"\r\n\r\nI may mention that it is a peculiar characteristic of Addicks that one\r\nmay talk to him as though he were a pick-pocket, and he will not resent\r\nit, if it is \"business.\" Where H. H. Rogers would flash into a Vesuvius\r\nof wrath, the Delaware statesman only smiles.\r\n\r\nAddicks by no means convinced me of his sincerity. I decided I would\r\ntest him pretty thoroughly before I went further. So I said: \"This seems\r\nthe proper time for a clean statement from you as to just where you and\r\nyour companies stand.\"\r\n\r\nI did not believe this man could make an absolutely truthful statement\r\non any subject of importance, but I knew enough of his real position to\r\nprotect me from being fooled. What was my surprise, therefore, when in\r\nthe most open way possible he calmly spread before me a condition of\r\naffairs far worse than the worst I knew. He was, indeed, bankrupt and\r\nhis corporation was in little better shape.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could catch my breath I said:\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you refused my proposition last night. If your bankers had\r\ndreamed of this state of affairs, they would have had a receiver\r\nto-day. You cannot meet my terms. You cannot even carry out the ones you\r\nyourself offered.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks leaned back on the cushions of his chair in the easiest, most\r\n_insouciant_ way imaginable. He grinned. \"That's true,\" he replied, \"but\r\nI never give up a ship till I feel her bump the bottom, and I am sure\r\nthat, bad as things are, you and I can pull them out and whip Rogers to\r\na standstill.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable situation. Here was one of the most ruthless\r\nfinancial schemers of the age cornered for slaughter, and he had put\r\nhimself absolutely at the mercy of the man who had bitterly fought him\r\nand whom he knew hated his kind. Yet he was as cool and collected as a\r\nbunch of orange blossoms at a winter's wedding.\r\n\r\nThe man's supreme nerve astounded me, yet I could not help admiring him.\r\nI saw through his game, yet his assurance fascinated me. I thought a\r\nminute. I said to him: \"Addicks, I'm really sorry for you, and I'll\r\npromise you here now to keep what you've told me sacred. What's more,\r\nI'll stop fighting you. I'll cover my shares and without doing any one\r\nany harm I'll help make prices a bit better for your securities.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, said \"Thank you!\" and continued looking at me as though he\r\nawaited something further, a quizzical, expectant smile on his face.\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence. Finally I said to him--and there were\r\nneither red lights nor warning intuitions to signal my peril: \"Just what\r\ndo you expect me to do, Mr. Addicks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you think best,\" he replied in a mild tone. Then, rousing\r\nhimself a bit, he went on: \"They say in the market that you like a fight\r\nand the harder it is the better. Well, I certainly have an uphill fight.\r\nDo as you would have the other fellow do to you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that I had no further doubts of Addicks' slickness. I said to him:\r\n\"You are certainly the shrewd man they describe you as. Now continue to\r\nbe frank long enough to answer this one question: Did you figure this\r\nout as the last card to throw at me, knowing that the very desperation\r\nof the case might warm me up and tempt me to tackle it for the sake of\r\nthe fight there's in it?\"\r\n\r\nInstantly Addicks knew his game was won. He straightened up and was the\r\nable, shrewd, and cunning financier who had tricked conservative Boston.\r\nHis facts chased his figures in marvellously rapid succession, and he\r\nshowed a knowledge of conditions, relations, and corporation tricks that\r\ndazzled me. For an hour he rushed on, and when at last he came to a stop\r\nI said to him:\r\n\r\n\"It's unnecessary to say any more. I see the situation as you would have\r\nme see it, and it comes to this: If I refuse to link up with you it\r\nmeans another 'Standard Oil' victory and another wreck for Boston.\r\nRogers' success means that New England speculators and investors will\r\nagain, for the three hundred and thirty-third time, be robbed of their\r\nsavings. If I get in, we may either avert all this or I may be ground up\r\nat the same time you are. However, it's too good a fight to miss, and so\r\nhere goes. I'll link up.\"\r\n\r\nAt some particularly hazardous halting-place in after-years Addicks and\r\nmyself have often laughed as we have talked over that August evening on\r\nthe _Now-Then_. I was easy, he asserts, and I must admit that he is\r\nright--I was easy. Yet no one knew Addicks better than I did then.\r\nLooking back along his extraordinary career, one is obliged to allow a\r\ncertain magic as a factor in his men-and-dollar tussles. We had\r\nabsolutely nothing in common, Addicks and I. We thought and felt\r\ndifferently about every relationship of life. A dozen other ventures,\r\nsure, easy, and promising infinitely greater profits, were ready at my\r\nhand--but he appealed to my sense of adventure, he promised me abundant\r\nand glorious fighting, and I forgot everything else and went with him.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Now-Then_ touched her pier and I stepped ashore, it was as\r\ncaptain of Addicks' corporation and stock-market forces, with absolute\r\npower to wage war, make peace, and use in whatever way I thought best\r\nsuch resources of his as I could lay hands on. I lost no time. Within\r\nforty-eight hours of my return to Boston I had mapped out my campaign,\r\nreconstructed Addicks' broken lines, and gayly set forth on about as\r\nforlorn a hope as ever operator or fighter tackled.\r\n\r\nNothing more desperate could be imagined than the condition of the\r\nDelaware financier's affairs when I assumed control. All the resources\r\nof his companies were pledged for loans, and the constantly falling\r\nprices of his securities, coupled with the discrediting stories Rogers'\r\nagents kept in circulation, made it difficult to keep these going. To\r\npay would mean ruin, for Addicks had no further thing of value to\r\npledge. At the same time, Rogers' company, which had now paralleled many\r\nof the Bay State Company's pipes, had secured a large slice of that\r\ncorporation's business, and had a corps of up-to-date solicitors working\r\novertime to secure the balance. Boston, in the meantime, having decided\r\nthat Addicts' star was of the shooting variety, and on its return trip,\r\nwas throwing up its hat in the wake of the \"Standard Oil\" band-wagon.\r\nThe city government and the Massachusetts Legislature had awakened to\r\nthe enormity of Addicksism and were boiling over with that brand of\r\nvirtue which the \"System\" and \"Standard Oil\" know so well how to rouse\r\nin American breasts by way of American pockets. By this time Rogers'\r\ninvestment in Boston had grown from the half-million he had in the\r\nbeginning estimated as sufficient to annihilate Addicks to three and a\r\nhalf millions, a million and a half of which represented real property,\r\nand the balance, all kinds of expenditures made in the fight to crush\r\nthe Delaware financier, a large part of it being invested in the votes\r\nand favor of State and municipal authorities.\r\n\r\nChief among the enemies of Addicks at this period was the young and\r\nbrilliant boss of Boston, its reform mayor, the Hon. Nathan Matthews,\r\nand thereby hangs a swinging tale. When the Addicks-Rogers gas-fight\r\nbroke out in Boston this Nathan Matthews was at the zenith of his\r\npolitical career, and was rather a greater man than even reform mayors\r\ngenerally fancy themselves. He was at that state of development in the\r\nlives of aspiring persons which compels the average spectator to debate\r\nwhether the swelling of the cranium should be met by a larger hat-band\r\nor by a sweeping haircut. _En passant_, Addicks' Panama had had its\r\nfifth enlargement to accommodate the successive bulges of his brow.\r\n\r\nNow, the city of Boston's contract with the Bay State Company for gas at\r\na dollar and twenty-five cents, which had run a long term of years, was\r\njust expiring. One bright June morning the mayor's secretary telephoned\r\nthe secretary of the Mogul from Delaware that His Honor of Boston,\r\ndesired converse with the Gas King. If those who overheard the dialogue\r\ncan be credited, the parley was of this character:\r\n\r\n\"This is the mayor of Boston, the Hon. Nathan Matthews.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, Gas King and United States\r\nSenator-to-be. What would you with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would hold converse with you in regard to a contract of much moment\r\nwhich will expire in a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well and good. My office is in West Street. Give your card to my first,\r\nsecond, or third secretary and I will not keep you waiting long.\"\r\n\r\n\"The office of the mayor of Boston is at the City Hall and my first or\r\nunder-secretary will make things agreeable while you wait. When will you\r\ncall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have you understand, Mr. Mayor, that any one to talk gas with\r\nJ. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks, Gas King and United State Senator-to-be,\r\ncomes to his office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day to you, Mr. Gas King and United States Senator-to-be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day to you, Mr. Mayor.\"\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, guarantee that the conversation took exactly the\r\nform here given it, but no injustice has been done its substance, nor\r\nwould it be possible to estimate in miles the breach it created. From\r\nthat telephonic encounter date the earnest efforts of Matthews and\r\nAddicks to do up each other, in which both were successful to a degree\r\nthat filled their hearts with Indian pleasure.\r\n\r\nA few days later public announcement was made that the Brookline Gas\r\nCompany, Rogers' corporation, had been awarded the contract for lighting\r\nBoston, and that henceforth the legal price of gas to the consumer was\r\nto be $1 per thousand feet. This was due notice to all concerned that\r\n\"Standard Oil\" had captured City Hall, and Addicks realized his error.\r\nHe sought the mayor's office, but the mayor had no time to see him. His\r\ncompanies met the new rate. There was nothing else for them to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BAY STATE GAS FIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was to this condition that I had to adapt my campaigning plans. I\r\ndetermined first to raise the market price of Addicks' securities; to\r\nturn the tide against the \"Standard Oil\" by that most potent of\r\nstock-market weapons, publicity; and then to attack Rogers from the rear\r\nthrough the City Hall. For Addicks to attempt to match pocket-books with\r\nRogers and \"Standard Oil\" in corrupting city or State officials I knew\r\nwould be useless; and besides a fundamental stipulation in the agreement\r\nwith the Delaware financier on the _Now-Then_ had been that under no\r\ncircumstances should bribery or corruption be allowed to enter into any\r\nof our plans while I was connected with the enterprise. I had always\r\nheld, do now, and always shall hold, that the meanest crime in the\r\ncalendar of vice is bribery of the servants of the people. I felt pretty\r\nsure, moreover, that I could play a card that would more than offset the\r\ndollars of \"Standard Oil.\" Nathan Matthews was on the high-road to the\r\ngovernor's chair, but I happened to know that, however ambitious he\r\nmight be for political preferment, his temperament rendered him more\r\navid for distinction in business. Addicks had within his gift the\r\nrichest plum in all the Boston commercial world. As controller of the\r\naffairs of the Bay State Company of Delaware, which controlled the\r\nnomination and consequent election of the officers of the old Boston gas\r\ncompanies, he could award to any one he pleased the presidency of these\r\ncorporations, together with the large salary that went with the\r\noffice.[6]\r\n\r\nMy plans in shape, I rushed to the firing-line. I began with a statement\r\nto the investors of New England and the gas consumers of Boston brimming\r\nover with facts and figures. Then I fired a volley of candid details as\r\nto the manner in which city and State officials had recently betrayed\r\nthe public's interests. Lastly, I discharged at \"Standard Oil\" a\r\nbroadside which my attorneys and friends assured me meant jail on a\r\nlibel charge. I put my banking-house and my personal guarantee behind\r\nthe old and new loans, and proceeded to roll up my sleeves in the\r\nstock-market. I got results at once. A change became apparent in public\r\nsentiment--the rottenness of Addicksism was overcome by the stench of\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" The prices of Bay State stocks and bonds shot up; loan\r\nfunds were offered freely and at lower rates of interest.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, reprisals. Rogers met my onslaught by a manoeuvre\r\nnew in \"Standard Oil\" tactics. He came into the open, issuing a\r\nproclamation over his own signature which gave me the lie, at the same\r\ntime tearing off a yard or two of my skin and throwing on a bucket of\r\nbrine to remind me I had lost it. This attack was just off the press\r\nwhen I was out with a rejoinder which he, in after-years, referred to as\r\nquite the hottest thing of its kind he had ever read. In it I calmly,\r\nbut in that \"chunk English\" which those who really wish to convey the\r\ntruth naked can always find handy, told him plainly who he was,\r\nexplicitly what \"Standard Oil\" was, and exactly who and what I was. I\r\nopine that about either assault there was nothing dignified, generous,\r\nor refined, but in stock-exchange battles one has not time to scent\r\nshrapnel. The immediate result of this interchange of deckle-edged[7]\r\ninsults was to daze the public. \"Standard Oil\" attacked and actually\r\nreplying; Rogers assaulting Lawson and Lawson sending back worse than he\r\ngot--almost anything might happen next. It was right here I got to\r\nRogers' _solar plexus_. I came out with another plain public talk, and\r\ngave him the choice of haling me into court--in which event I pledged\r\nhim my word I would send him and his associates to jail for bribery and\r\nother crimes--or of acknowledging to the world he was licked and on the\r\nrun. He was silent and I loudly claimed victory. The price of Addicks\r\nstocks quickly emphasized our success by a further advance.\r\n\r\nThus far the campaign appeared to be working smoothly, and I turned my\r\nattention next to my rear attack. I began negotiations with Mayor\r\nMatthews for the withdrawal of his support from Rogers. It was a\r\ndifficult task, but after much manoeuvring I landed my big fish. I\r\npromised him the presidency of the Boston, South Boston, Roxbury, and\r\nBay State gas companies for the term of three years, at a salary of\r\n$25,000 per annum, with the explicit understanding that he was to allow\r\nme, as his vice-president, to see that the bargain between us was lived\r\nup to. When the trade was made it was understood that the fact of\r\nMatthews' change of base should be kept secret, and that he should not\r\nassume the office until the end of his term as mayor of Boston. With\r\nthat agreement the deal was clinched, signed, sealed, and delivered.\r\n\r\nIn order that my readers may comprehend the events that follow, it is\r\nnecessary that they understand something of the complications in which\r\nAddicks' manipulations had involved that corporation.\r\n\r\nWhen Addicks purchased the several Boston gas properties he organized a\r\ncompany, the Bay State of Delaware, in which this ownership was vested.\r\nIn order to facilitate the financing of the new corporation and for\r\nother manipulative purposes of his own, Addicks created an inner\r\ncorporation, the Bay State of New Jersey, owned by the treasury of the\r\nBay State of Delaware, to which he turned over the stocks of the Boston\r\ngas companies. These the Bay State of New Jersey transferred to the\r\nMercantile Trust Company of New York as collateral for the twelve\r\nmillion Boston Gas bonds which had been sold to the investing public.\r\nWhile to all intents and purposes the Bay State of Delaware was owner of\r\nthe subsidiary properties, the contract with the Mercantile Trust\r\nCompany was made with the Bay State of New Jersey, and it was to the\r\npresident of the latter corporation (Addicks) that the Trust Company was\r\nbound to deliver the proxies for the gas stocks in its possession, three\r\ndays before an annual election. Knowledge of this subcutaneous\r\ncorporation was confined to Addicks and his immediate associates, and\r\nthe Delaware financier alone quite grasped its potentialities.\r\n\r\nHitherto Addicks had used the proxies to elect himself president of each\r\nof the subordinate corporations, drawing the several salaries which went\r\nwith the offices. To prevail on him to give up these places and their\r\nemoluments to a man he hated as bitterly as he did Matthews was a\r\ndifficult task, but his situation was desperate. Finally, he agreed. I\r\ndid not know till long afterward that this reluctant compliance was\r\nyielded only after Addicks had had a secret session with his Bay State\r\ndirectors, at which they voted him, by way of salve for his resignation,\r\na sum equal to three years' salary, $75,000.\r\n\r\nThe mayor, who was a lawyer, prided himself on his shrewdness, and was\r\nfully alive to the serpent strategy of Addicks. He determined that the\r\nprize he had secured should not slip through his fingers for lack of\r\nprecaution. We had many legal pow-wows in which the most astute lawyers\r\nat the Boston bar were called in, and finally the directors of the Bay\r\nState made an iron-clad contract with Nathan Matthews, agreeing to\r\ndeliver over to him whatever proxies it, the Bay State Gas of Delaware,\r\nreceived from the Mercantile Trust Company of New York, on a given day\r\nbefore the annual election, with which he, of course, could elect\r\nhimself president. This contract was signed by Addicks and his directors\r\nand by all the officers of the Bay State of Delaware corporation, and\r\nwas passed on and approved by the eminent law sharps both sides had\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nA few days after the document that made Nathan Matthews supreme boss of\r\nBoston Gas was conveyed to him, there came an explosion. Like the\r\npremature bursting of a bombshell at a Fourth of July celebration, the\r\ntransaction \"leaked,\" and the press announced in sable head-lines that\r\nMayor Matthews had sold out, that Addicks was on top, and that Rogers\r\nand \"Standard Oil\" would surely be found beneath the _débris_. Matthews\r\nhas always claimed that this \"leakage\" was a piece of Addicks' double\r\ndealing; Addicks declares it was a part of Matthews' and Rogers'\r\ndeep-laid plan to give him the double cross. Anyway, as a hurrier-up of\r\ncoming events the news was most successful, although its effect was\r\nsomewhat of the nature of that produced by the throwing in of an\r\noverdose of soda at a candy pull--the pot boiled over, and the air for a\r\ntime was permeated with the odor of burned sweets. In spite of all\r\npublic and private criticism Matthews budged not a jot, and confirmed\r\nthe reports. I made the most of our triumph over \"Standard Oil,\" and for\r\na few days the public took to it, too. Then came one of those return\r\nwaves of sentiment which may always be counted on in any contest in\r\nwhich \"Standard Oil\" is engaged. From mysterious places and in\r\nuntraceable ways the report became current that victory was really with\r\nRogers instead of with our side; that the deal was a smooth piece of\r\nMachiavelian work; that Matthews when he took the helm was to steer our\r\nship alongside one of Rogers' forts and perhaps drop anchor under a row\r\nof his concealed guns.\r\n\r\nThis rumor alarmed me. I lost no time in running it to earth, and\r\ndiscovered to my consternation that Matthews had spent the night before\r\nhe made the agreement to come over to us in New York, at the home of H.\r\nH. Rogers. Exactly what had occurred there, or what their programme was,\r\nI don't know. Long after this episode had slipped into gas history, at\r\nthe time when Rogers and myself were doing business together, I asked\r\nhim to enlighten me on this one point, and he did to the extent of\r\nsaying, \"Matthews only did what I approved of.\" This certainly redeemed\r\nMatthews in my eyes from the reproach of having sold out his friends.\r\nThere is nothing more despicable than a man who, after having consented\r\nto be \"put\" will not \"stay put\"--even though the first \"put\" be of a\r\nquestionable character.\r\n\r\nThis new complication demanded immediate action. I called on Matthews to\r\nmake public announcement that I was to be his vice-president, and thus\r\nset at rest the reports that were fast destroying the beneficial effects\r\nof our coup. I argued that such an announcement would convince the\r\npublic that victory was with us and not with Rogers. My surprise may be\r\ngrasped when the Mayor placed this icicle in my hot palm:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lawson, it has long been my ambition to show the public of Boston\r\nand gas consumers what I could do with this situation, and now that I am\r\nabsolutely assured of gas supremacy, I would have you and all others\r\ndistinctly understand I will run it as I deem best, regardless of the\r\nwishes of any one.\"\r\n\r\nNathan Matthews was destined later to learn that in an Addicks edifice\r\nthere are secret trap-doors and concealed passageways available for\r\nquick escape in emergency, and that the term \"absolutely assured\" is of\r\nrelative value when used in high finance, with Addicks to interpret the\r\nrelativeness. A few days after the mayor had shown his colors the annual\r\nelection was \"pulled off\" in an unexpected manner. The Mercantile Trust\r\nCompany delivered its proxies to the president of the Bay State _of New\r\nJersey_, who promptly re-elected himself and his friends to their old\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nNext morning the public, the press, and the ex-mayor were alike\r\nsurprised to learn that J. Edward O'Sullivan Addicks was still president\r\nof all the Boston gas companies; that General Sam Thomas, of New York,\r\nand Thomas W. Lawson, of Boston, were vice-presidents; and that the\r\nexpected and widely heralded Matthews turnover to Matthews had been\r\nindefinitely postponed. There was a tremendous \"towse\" for a few days\r\nduring which time I tried my hand at public-opinion moulding, and so\r\nsuccessfully that all interested saw that the tide had really turned,\r\nand was running swiftly against the heretofore invincible \"Standard\r\nOil.\" Rogers tried to stem it by causing it to be known that Matthews\r\nwas to carry the new complication to the courts, but we quickly disposed\r\nof this possibility by reaching a settlement with our man. This was\r\nbrought about by the payment to Matthews of a number of thousands of\r\ndollars, which Addicks afterward informed me he had entered in the\r\ngas-books as \"balm salary.\" From this event until August, 1895, it was\r\none continuous running fire with Rogers and his crowd, with a constant\r\ngain to our side in public opinion, though final victory was still far\r\noff because of the unlimited money resources of \"Standard Oil.\" In fact,\r\nit gradually became evident that, though we might hold out, it was\r\nimpossible to whip \"Standard Oil\" to an open acknowledgment of defeat.\r\n\r\nThe phase of the problem that gave me keenest cause for uneasiness was\r\nthe possibility I recognized of treachery in my own camp. I had become\r\npainfully aware that Addicks was getting impatient and was ready at any\r\nfavorable moment to make one of his quick Judas turns, which would land\r\nhim safe with Rogers as the price of the slaughter of the rest of us.\r\nTrue, I had taken all possible precautions to safeguard my own and my\r\nfriends' interests against his craft by securing from him and from the\r\nsubsidiary companies iron-clad power to act for them without\r\nconsultation. To get this I had had to use great pressure, for he had\r\nbalked long and hard against giving it. This was the condition of\r\naffairs when I decided to stake everything on one move.\r\n\r\n     * Certain of my critics have seized upon the transaction\r\n     with Mayor Matthews, narrated in this chapter, to say: \"He\r\n     bribed the Mayor and is no better than other bribers.\"\r\n\r\n     The fact is, that the only thing the Mayor of Boston could\r\n     do in the gas war--take sides with Rogers, grant a permit to\r\n     the Brookline company to open the streets and come in\r\n     competition with our companies, thus compelling, in the\r\n     interests of the people, a reduction in the selling price of\r\n     gas from $1.25 to $1.00--the Mayor had already done. There\r\n     was nothing more in his power, and the only object we had in\r\n     securing his services was to put him between our companies\r\n     and Rogers, in the belief that Rogers, owing to his former\r\n     relations, would not dare fire through him.\r\n\r\n     I never, directly or indirectly, bribed Mayor Matthews; but,\r\n     on the contrary, only induced him to do what he had a moral\r\n     right to do and I a moral right to ask him to do.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] See page 109.\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. Lawson's proclamations and market communications are invariably\r\nprinted on the finest grade of deckle-edged paper.--THE PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ROGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made up my mind that the time had come for a final engagement, I\r\ndecided myself to try legitimately to settle with Mr. Rogers, and\r\nprepared two letters which, if he were willing for us to get together,\r\nwould pave the way for a meeting. These letters I sent by my secretary,\r\nMr. Vinal, to Mr. Rogers at Fairhaven. My readers, in weighing this odd\r\ncorrespondence, must bear in mind what the relations between Mr. Rogers\r\nand myself had been. We had vilified each other in every imaginable way,\r\nand I knew, or at least I thought I did, that the \"Standard Oil\" magnate\r\nwould not hesitate to use any written communication of mine that he\r\ncould lay hold of to bring about a split between Addicks and myself. I\r\nhad good evidence that he believed that in such a rupture lay his only\r\nchance of bringing home the quieting blow he had been trying to inflict\r\non us. Letter I. read as follows:\r\n\r\n     HENRY H. ROGERS, Fairhaven, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: My secretary, Mr. Vinal, will hand you this\r\n     letter. If after reading it you are desirous of further\r\n     communication with me, he has instructions, after you have\r\n     returned this one to him, sealed in the enclosed envelope,\r\n     to hand you another, which if after reading you return to\r\n     him in another enclosed envelope, he will bring to me with\r\n     whatever verbal answer you may care to send.\r\n\r\n     My secretary knows nothing more of his errand or the\r\n     contents of either letter. He can, therefore, give you no\r\n     further information. If you do not call for the second\r\n     letter, I will consider you do not care to pursue the\r\n     subject further, which will lead me to notify you that the\r\n     Boston gas war will end in a most sensational way next\r\n     Wednesday.\r\n\r\n     Believe me, sir,\r\n         Yours respectfully,\r\n             (Signed) THOMAS W. LAWSON.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Fairhaven Mr. Vinal informed me that Mr. Rogers,\r\nafter reading this letter twice, folded and placed it in the envelope I\r\nhad sent and handed it without comment to him, whereupon my secretary\r\ndelivered to him letter II., which was a type-written communication on a\r\nplain bit of paper, addressed to no one, signed by no one, and bearing\r\nno marks to identify the sender:\r\n\r\n     There is a gas war now existing. Upon one side is the\r\n     \"Standard Oil.\" Upon the other the Addicks Bay State\r\n     companies.\r\n\r\n     After a fight has been begun there are but four things\r\n     possible:\r\n\r\n     \"Standard Oil\" can sell out to the Bay State.\r\n\r\n     The Bay State can sell out to the \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\n     They can come together by consolidation; or\r\n\r\n     They can continue fighting until one or the other has been\r\n     annihilated.\r\n\r\n     Nothing else is possible. Therefore, one of these four\r\n     things is to be the outcome of the present war.\r\n\r\n     If you can be shown now that if one of the first three is\r\n     not settled upon before next Wednesday the fourth will be\r\n     impossible beyond that date, and that it is absolutely in\r\n     the power of one man, without consultation with any one, to\r\n     bring about the accomplishment of any one of the first\r\n     three, you will meet that man before next Wednesday and make\r\n     your selection.\r\n\r\n     I can absolutely prove to you that this war will not\r\n     continue after next Wednesday, and that it is absolutely in\r\n     my power, without consulting any one, to do any one of the\r\n     three things you signify you desire done.\r\n\r\nMr. Vinal reported that Mr. Rogers also read this letter a second time,\r\nbut slowly and carefully, as though he were weighing each word, and\r\nthen, sealing it in the envelope, passed it back to him with: \"Say to\r\nyour employer I return to New York to-morrow, Sunday night, and shall be\r\nat my office, 26 Broadway, from 9.30 on Monday morning till five in the\r\nafternoon; that I shall dine at my house, 26 East 57th Street; that I\r\nshall be through dinner at eight o'clock, and that I go to bed at 10.30.\r\nTell him that any man who has an important communication to make to me\r\naffecting a matter in which I have large interests will be welcome to\r\ncall on me between the hours I have named, provided he notifies me a\r\nlittle while in advance.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my secretary, whose practice it was to give me the minutest\r\ndetails of such affairs as this errand, had reported all that had\r\nhappened, I at once sent a message to 26 Broadway stating that I would\r\nbe at Rogers' house at eight o'clock on Monday night, and on the stroke\r\nI pushed his electric latchstring. His man had hardly taken my hat when\r\nMr. Rogers himself came down the hall with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA MEMORABLE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the years of my life are protracted beyond the Psalmist's threescore\r\nand ten, even though the events that chance in the comparatively long\r\nfuture seethe and struggle as strenuously as those that befell in the\r\neager, vivid procession of yesterdays which makes up my past, my\r\nmemory's picture of this meeting will always hang where the lights cast\r\ntheir kindest reflections.\r\n\r\nI had left Boston on the noon train, and got down to my hotel, the\r\nBrunswick, on Fifth Avenue, by six o'clock. In those kind days of good\r\nmemory when New Yorkers really lived instead of looping-the-loop through\r\nlife, the Brunswick was head-quarters for Southerners and Bostonians of\r\nthe old school. To-day its bricks and mortar and the picturesque iron\r\nbalconies, from which two generations of America's celebrities reviewed\r\nthe marching armies of peace and war, are heaps of refuse; for the old\r\nBrunswick has had to give place to yet one more of the twenty-storied,\r\nemblazoned hostelries, whose alabaster halls, frescoed walls, mosaic\r\nfloors, and onyx and silver bathtubs are designed to minister to the\r\ncomfort of our great and free people when they needs must wander from\r\nthe luxury of their homes. When I had dressed I crossed over to the old\r\nDelmonico's opposite, and, in a secluded corner beside an open window\r\nwhich gave full view of the passing show on Gotham's great boulevard, I\r\nsat and listened to old \"Philip,\" who, time out of mind, had been\r\nhigh-priest of the famous Frenchman's temple of appetite, as he posted\r\nme on the latest doings of the town where no one remembers further back\r\nthan yesterday, and to-morrow doesn't count. Ordinarily I should have\r\nlingered for hours with \"Philip\" and his tidbits, but that night my\r\nmind was a mad steeplechase of memories and hopes, all starting and\r\nfinishing at 26 East 57th Street, and I fear he must have thought he had\r\nfailed in the plump little duck which I left unpicked, and in the bottle\r\nof Chianti which I hardly sipped.\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 I lit my cigar and started for what I felt was to be the tomb or\r\nthe forcing-house of all the air-castles I had cherished from boyhood.\r\nAt last I was to meet the real champion; I was to tussle hand-to-hand\r\nwith the head of the financial clan, the man of all men best fitted to\r\ntest to the utmost the skill and quickness which I had picked up in the\r\nrough and tumble of a hundred fights on State and Wall streets--Rogers,\r\nwary, intrepid, implacable, the survivor of bloody battles in comparison\r\nwith which mine were but pink skirmishes.\r\n\r\nI had carefully put aside that half-hour between dinner and the moment\r\nfor my appointment to run up and down my mental keyboard under what to\r\nme are the most favorable conditions possible--an evening walk through\r\nthe streets of a great city. Some men can invite their souls only in\r\nsylvan solitudes, but the flare of light, the clash of traffic, the\r\nkaleidoscopic procession of humanity, with its challenging contrasts\r\nshifting and seething on great metropolitan highways, breed in my mind a\r\nsense of calm, cool remoteness in which all the glitter and excitement\r\nof the spectacle suggests only its appalling transiency.\r\n\r\nFrom the gay carnival of Broadway I cut across through the brownstone\r\ngloom of 27th Street into Sixth Avenue, where the tired men and women of\r\nthe toiling millions sat in their doorways or at their windows over the\r\nshops resting after the heat and travail of the day. Some watched the\r\nsidewalk antics of their children--perhaps speculating on the\r\npossibility that this or the other among that merry throng of urchins\r\nmight rise to be an alderman or even a city boss--perhaps President of\r\nthe greatest republic on earth--or--transcendent bliss--a Rogers or a\r\nRockefeller.\r\n\r\nFrom 42d Street I turned up Fifth Avenue, lifting my hat and exchanging\r\na word with Mr. and Mrs. Russell Sage, and for an instant, as I left\r\nthem, my wandering thoughts took a new twist, for Mrs. Sage had informed\r\nme that \"Father and I are on the way to prayer-meeting\"--early evening\r\nprayer-meeting in New York! For an instant I was in one of those tiny\r\nNew Hampshire villages, a forgotten haven of rest and simplicity,\r\ninnocent as yet of steam, machinery, or trolleys, for the sweet lady and\r\nthe angular man with the pained gait which spoke in loud tones of the\r\nunbroken store-shoe could belong in no other than a rural place. But the\r\nimage of the New Hampshire village only flitted across my mind's film,\r\nfor my truant senses seized on a message over memory's telephone:\r\n\"Russell Sage has $100,000,000.\" One hundred millions, and I was back on\r\nearth again, but as I walked the thought was buzzing in my brain: \"Is it\r\npossible that that countryman has MADE _one hundred million dollars_,\r\nwhen the expert carpenter who started at the birth of Christ to trudge\r\nthe world until from his honest labors he had accumulated $1,000,000 by\r\nlaying aside each day all the wage he was entitled to, one dollar, had\r\nat the end of 1,900 years only a little more than half that sum?\"\r\n\r\nAt last I turned the corner of 57th Street, and when I looked down Mr.\r\nRogers' home-like hall and grasped his outstretched hand and heard his\r\n\"Lawson, I'm glad to see you!\" I would have sworn it was hours and hours\r\nsince I left the little table in the corner of Delmonico's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief impression I recall of my experience that night is gratitude\r\nfor Henry H. Rogers' unexpected kindness, and admiration for his\r\nmanliness, ability, and firmness. When this memory rises in my mind I\r\nregret \"Frenzied Finance\" and all the consequences with which it is\r\nfraught for him and his connections. When the American people are\r\naroused, as they surely will be, to demand restitution and are in the\r\nact of brushing, with a mighty sweep of indignation, back into the laps\r\nof the plundered the billions of which they have been robbed, and\r\n\"Standard Oil\" and the \"System\" break and fall like trees before the\r\ngale, I doubt, even if Henry H. Rogers be brought face to face with\r\nruin, that he will feel half the pain I shall, for I know that the\r\npicture of that memorable night will surely come back to me with all\r\nthe vividness of reality.\r\n\r\nBut as my mind harks back, there clashes with this another, a hellish\r\npicture, which the same Henry H. Rogers painted with the brush of\r\nAmalgamated, and a procession of convicts and suicides trail slowly\r\ntoward me out of the canvas. Then I realize that my pen is but the\r\ninstrument of a righteous retribution and that no personal feelings,\r\nhowever tender, must be allowed to interfere.\r\n\r\n\"Come this way,\" said my host, striding ahead of me along the hall. \"In\r\nhere we can have our talk and our smoke undisturbed.\" He led me into the\r\nbig, empty dining-room and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I began, \"it is kind of you to be so friendly after the\r\nmean things we have said of each other. Am I to understand you don't lay\r\nany of all that has passed up against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay it up against you, my boy? Drop that all out of your mind. You\r\nprobably know I talk to the point and mean what I say. If you had hit\r\nbelow the belt as that--Addicks has, I _would_ lay it up against you and\r\na hundred years would not make me forget it. I know what you've done and\r\nwhy you've done it, and it was as much your right to do it as mine to do\r\nwhat I have done. I have nothing against you, and if events place me in\r\na position where I can do anything to make your job easier without\r\nhurting my own interests--mind that, without hurting my own interests--I\r\nwill do it. You have my word for it.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat within a few feet of each other, and I looked squarely into his\r\neyes as he said, \"You have my word for it,\" and they were honest\r\neyes--honest as the ten-year-old boy's who with legs apart and hands in\r\npockets throws his head back and says: \"Wait until I am a man, and I\r\nwill do it if I die for it!\" I looked into them and I knew \"My word for\r\nit\" was all gold and a hundred cents to the dollar. For a minute we\r\ngazed steadily into--through each other, and I knew he was reading away\r\ninto the back of my head. Inwardly I said: \"If I do business with this\r\nman for a day or for a lifetime, I will never face him and give him my\r\nword for one thing and mean another,\" and in the years after when we did\r\nmillions upon millions of business, with only each other's word for a\r\nbond of fair treatment, not once did I depart from the letter of my\r\nresolution. Up to the recent famous \"Gas Trial,\" where our roads\r\nsuddenly shot off at right angles, owing to a foul act of perjury, Henry\r\nH. Rogers never tired of meeting all his associates' attacks upon me\r\nwith: \"Lawson's word is gospel truth for me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we dropped our eyes, both evidently satisfied, he said: \"Now, what\r\nhave you to say to me?\"\r\n\r\nI spoke my piece rapidly and without interruption: \"There are four\r\nthings possible, as I wrote you--only four. I will take up the fourth\r\nfirst. I have absolute power to speak for all our local companies. If\r\nwe, you and I, come to no settlement by to-morrow night, I will, without\r\nwarning to any one, confess a default to the notes of our different\r\ncompanies and have a receiver appointed. As our stocks and bonds are\r\nheld by our best investors all over New England, and as no such move is\r\nsuspected, there will be a terrific rumpus. In the crash I shall go down\r\nwith Addicks and the rest, for we have all put our personal resources\r\nbehind the enterprise. I will see that the howl following the crash\r\nshall be such as all must hear, and I will call attention to the illegal\r\nacts of every one--your companies, Addicks' companies, and the city and\r\nState officials that have made such conditions possible. I don't think\r\nyou will be able to stand against the cyclone this crash will raise; but\r\neven if you do, the receiver, having no interest to pay on bonds, will\r\nbe in a position to smash the price of gas to seventy or seventy-five\r\ncents, and make it impossible for you to get possession of our companies\r\nfor so long a time that the consumers will never allow you to get the\r\nprice back to a profitable one. Have I made it clear that you cannot, as\r\nyou were counting on doing, continue this fight till you have us tired\r\nout and crushed?\"\r\n\r\nHis answer came as clear, quick, and sharp as the click of a revolver:\r\n\"Perfectly, provided you can do the thing you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will prove to you I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary,\" he clicked back. \"Do you give me your word that\r\nyou can?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"That leaves only three possibilities,\" I continued. \"You buy us; we buy\r\nyou; or, we consolidate. I will take the third first. Under any\r\ncircumstances or conditions will you join forces and do business with\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Under no circumstances nor conditions will I do any business with\r\nAddicks. He has played me false, broken his word, and lied to me when\r\nthere was no necessity for doing so, and no man who has done this once\r\ncan ever do business with me a second time.\"\r\n\r\nI once stood by a mechanism through which passed a strip of metal.\r\nClick! 'Twas cut. Whir! 'Twas a cylinder. Click! Whir! Click! A corner,\r\nan edge, an end, and b-r-r-rr! It was dropped, a metallic cartridge, to\r\ndo its part in peace or war. Even more fascinating was it to see this\r\nhuman machine eject the product of its whirring brain.\r\n\r\n\"Then we have but two possibilities. Will you buy us out at the price we\r\nmust have?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the price?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient to make good the promises that I have made to Addicks, my\r\nfriends, and the public since I have been in command,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Pass that by as an impossibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Mr. Rogers, we are down to this: You must sell and we must buy\r\nyou out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. Now, how do you propose to buy?\"\r\n\r\nFor months the ablest financiers and business men of Wall Street and\r\nBoston had striven to start up negotiations with Mr. Rogers with a view\r\nto settlement, and all had dropped them without even getting in an\r\nopening wedge, and here was I at the end of fifteen minutes of my first\r\nmeeting, with my task half accomplished. I went on:\r\n\r\n\"There is something more you must do, Mr. Rogers. You must assist us in\r\nbuying, which means you must sell at the terms you and I agree are the\r\nonly ones we can meet. Therefore I will run over our situation. You have\r\ncertain property, consisting of the Brookline Company and miscellaneous\r\ninvestments in connection with it. What cost does it stand you?\"\r\n\r\nFrankly, he went over what his Boston gas-war equipment consisted of and\r\nwhat it had cost, which, boiled down, amounted to $3,500,000. He then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Let us figure what it will be worth to you when, it being known you\r\nhave won out, you will have additional prestige and no competition.\"\r\n\r\nWe agreed upon $2,000,000 as representing the probable appreciation in\r\nwhat we were to acquire from him over and above any increase to our own\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take cost, $3,500,000, if it is cash or the equivalent, or I will\r\ntake $4,500,000 if it is to be credit of a nature that assures me my\r\nmoney eventually, and I will divide my profit of a million equally with\r\nyou. This sum will of course be in addition to anything you may be paid\r\nby Addicks.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly, as if we had agreed upon it in advance, our eyes met--his\r\ncold, clear, and steely business--mine, I hoped, the same. For a second\r\nneither of us said a word. Then I said: \"Thank you for the offer of the\r\n$500,000 profit, but we will cut all such offers out. My pay comes from\r\nmy side. I never yet have known the man who could take pay from both\r\nsides and do his work properly.\" I slowly drew out the word\r\n\"_properly_,\" and he in the same tone of voice said:\r\n\r\n\"'Properly' is better than 'honestly.' You know, Lawson, there is much\r\ncant in these times of which 'honesty' is the refrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You and I will make no headway discussing moral ethics, Mr. Rogers,\r\nalthough we may in discussing business practices,\" I said, and I chalked\r\nup on my mental black-board: \"Test One.\" Then I went on:\r\n\r\n\"I agree that $4,500,000, in anything we can pay in, is as fair a price\r\nas $3,500,000 cash, provided we find a credit guarantee satisfactory to\r\nyou; unless indeed you are willing to allow us the $500,000 you just\r\noffered me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I offered you was part of my profit. I will not allow any of it.\r\nMy price is the same whether I pay you anything or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Rogers, then the situation is this: In any trade that is\r\nmade it will first be necessary for you to turn your property over to us\r\nto manage in conjunction with our own. When the public see it in our\r\nhands, our securities will advance and we can, by issuing additional Bay\r\nState stock, sell it and secure whatever sum it will be necessary for us\r\nto have beyond what we can borrow on your securities. Do you agree with\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw it as I did.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine you will never consent to turn your property over to us on\r\nour say-so that we will later pay you for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right there. I would not take J. Edward Addicks' guarantee in\r\nany form he could possibly put it. Once he got his hands on my company,\r\nfor even thirty days, he would so far misuse it that he would\r\ndeliberately default for the purpose of returning it to me in a damaged\r\ncondition, and, in addition, would play some of those tricks which are\r\nsecond nature to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be necessary for us then,\" I went on, \"to give you some forfeit\r\nbond so large that, even if we misuse your property while it is in our\r\nhands, you will be repaid for the damage done, and it must be at the\r\nsame time something of such value to us that even Addicks will be\r\ncompelled to play fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can you put up?\" Mr. Rogers asked.\r\n\r\n\"Addicks has a right, through the Bay State Company of Delaware, to\r\nissue, through the Bay State Company of New Jersey, a million and a half\r\nnew bonds for the purpose of acquiring new property. He and I have\r\ndiscussed the scheme as a last resort should any settlement seem\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me there is anything Addicks can get his hands on\r\nwhich he has not yet used for his companies nor stolen for himself?\"\r\nreplied Mr. Rogers incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has time and again assured me of this, and he would not dare to\r\nlie to me under existing conditions.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose from his chair and stood directly in front of me and\r\nstraightened up for what I could see was to be an unusual effort. Then\r\nwith the force and the fire which in all his supreme moments make Henry\r\nH. Rogers wellnigh irresistible he said:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, I have listened to you. Now listen to me. I have taken you at\r\nyour word, and have talked frankly and shown you my hand as I have\r\nseldom shown it to a stranger. To do the business I want to do, I see I\r\nmust talk even more frankly than I already have, and I want you to weigh\r\ncarefully what I shall say to you, for it may have a great bearing on\r\nyour after-life. How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-seven,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were about thirty-seven,\" he said. \"Well, I am fifty-six\r\nand in experience am old enough to be your grandfather, so you can\r\nafford to give weight to what I am about to say, especially as I give\r\nyou my word that I speak for your benefit first and my own afterward. I\r\nwatched you before you hitched up with Addicks, and always thought that\r\nif the opportunity arose, we might do business together. We, or as you\r\nand others like to call us, 'Standard Oil,' have money enough to carry\r\nthrough whatever business we embark on and we know where there is all\r\nthe business to be had that we care to engage in. We have everything, in\r\nfact, but men. We are always short of men to carry out our\r\nprojects--young men, who are honest, therefore loyal; men to whom work\r\nis a pleasure; above all, men who have no price but our price. To such\r\nmen we can afford to give the only things they have not got, or, if they\r\nhave already got them, to give them in greater quantities--I mean power\r\nand money. You made a great mistake when you joined forces with Addicks,\r\nbecause no man can afford to be associated with the kind of a rascal\r\nAddicks is, the lowest I have yet come across. He is the type of man who\r\ncuts his best friend's throat with as much ease and satisfaction as he\r\ndoes his worst enemy's, if not with more. I fully expected that by this\r\ntime he would have sold you out. If he had, where would you have been?\r\nNow, here you are from sheer desperation driven to me to avoid utter\r\nfailure. Suppose you can do all you hope to--get the bonds, put them up\r\nand secure my property--do you not suppose that by that time Addicks\r\nwill have some mine dug under you which will blow you to destruction?\r\nBut grant even that he plays fair, and you bring the Boston situation\r\nup to a paying place, what good will it do you? You surely have more\r\nsense than to believe a man of Addicks' make-up can be permanently\r\nsuccessful?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers halted. I had risen, and we stood facing each other. I felt\r\nthat I was right here playing for that greatest of all stakes, my\r\nself-respect, the loss of which to any man, I had long before\r\ndiscovered, means ebon failure.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Say you'll come with us, and we'll fix up the Boston situation in some\r\nway that will forever eliminate Addicks from our affairs--your and my\r\naffairs. I would not insult you by asking you to sell Addicks out. It is\r\nunnecessary. He has no real rights in Boston. You and I can figure out a\r\nscheme that will take care of every other interest, and we'll give\r\nAddicks a lot more money than he can secure in any other way and show\r\nhim the door. As for you and me, we'll make a lot of money and make it\r\nfairly and above board. But I am not thinking so much of the immediate\r\nsituation as I am of the possibility of you joining us and working on\r\nsome of the deals we have on hand. I shall put you in a position to make\r\nmore money and secure more real power than you could possibly obtain in\r\na like time under any other conditions. You know corporations and the\r\nstock-market, and you can readily see what the combination of our money\r\nand prestige and your knowledge of the market and investors will mean.\"\r\n\r\nHeaven knows I could see what it all meant. I had even at that time in a\r\nchrysalis state those plans for destroying the \"System\" which now in a\r\nrounded out and matured form I intend to be the superstructure of my\r\nstory of \"Frenzied Finance.\" I had, a year before in Paris, outlined\r\nthose plans to some of the brightest financial minds of Europe, and\r\nwhile they had marvelled at their radicalness, they had pronounced them\r\nsound, and had offered to furnish the hundred million of dollars\r\nrequired for their execution. Then I realized that to take this money\r\nfrom bankers would hamper me in the execution of my plans, and I\r\npostponed putting the project in force until I could furnish the\r\nnecessary money through my own connections. Again, I had big ideas as\r\nto the copper situation--ideas that only awaited unlimited capital to be\r\nbrought before the people, and which, if carried out, would do for them\r\nwhat had as yet never been done--give them tremendous profits upon their\r\nsavings. And here were the unlimited capital and unlimited business\r\nprestige right at hand, but----\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I said, \"don't! Please don't! I appreciate your\r\nproposition, and I thank you, but I can't accept. I agree with you about\r\nAddicks, the position I am in, and the mistake or foolish recklessness I\r\nwas guilty of when I linked up with this Boston mess, but that doesn't\r\nalter the case an iota. I am enlisted with this man. I knew what he was\r\nwhen I consented to take charge of his affairs, and I should hate myself\r\nif I sold him out, even though I knew he would without hesitation sell\r\nme out. I must be true to myself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers remained silent. I went on:\r\n\r\n\"This, if I accepted your proposal, I could no longer be, even were\r\nAddicks and Boston Gas out of it. The man who is 'Standard Oil' wears a\r\ncollar, and if I did what you ask I should expect to wear a collar\r\nand--and--I can't do it.\" I stopped; I was not excited; it was\r\nimpossible to be so with that calm figure, apparently cut from crystal\r\nice, so near me, but I was very much in earnest. I wondered what would\r\ncome next. Mr. Rogers raised his hand and held it out to me, mine\r\ngrasped it, and without a word thus we stood long enough to put that\r\nseal on our friendship which none of the many financial hells we jointly\r\npassed through in the after-nine years was hot enough to melt.\r\n\r\nBut that friendship is ended now. Henry H. Rogers' evidence in the\r\nBoston \"Gas Trial\" was the spark that kindled the dead leaves of the\r\npast into the conflagration which, now spread beyond the control of man,\r\nhas brought to light the hidden skeletons of forgotten misdeeds and\r\nexposed them for all the world to see.\r\n\r\nHe at last broke the spell. \"Lawson, you're a queer chap; but we are all\r\nqueer, for that matter, and we must work along those lines we each think\r\nbest. I once stood, just as you do now, in front of a man whom I looked\r\nup to as all that was wisest and best. He made an earnest effort to\r\ninduce me to choose the ministry for my life-work, but I chose dollars\r\ninstead, and I sometimes wonder if I chose wisely; but, as I said, we\r\nall must select our pack and, as we are the ones who must carry it, I\r\nsuppose no one else should complain.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's pause I shot ahead into business again as though we had\r\nnever left it. It took me but a short time to arrange the details of our\r\ntrade. The Bay State of Delaware was to buy all of Mr. Rogers' Boston\r\ninvestments and to pay for the same $4,500,000--$1,500,000 in six\r\nmonths, $1,000,000 in a year, the balance in a year and a half, with\r\ninterest at five per cent.; the Bay State was to put up, as a pledge of\r\ngood faith, $1,500,000 new Boston bonds; and as soon as such deposit was\r\nmade, Mr. Rogers was to transfer his securities and corporation to us. I\r\nwas to go to Philadelphia that night and arrange all details with\r\nAddicks and report the following day.\r\n\r\nIt was 10.30 o'clock when I left 26 East 57th Street. I hurried down to\r\nthe Brunswick, where I had time only to shift my clothes and catch the\r\n\"midnight\" for Philadelphia. After breakfast next morning I tackled\r\nAddicks. It goes without saying that I was a cyclone of enthusiasm as I\r\nminutely ran through what I had done, beginning with my letter to Rogers\r\nand finishing up with my visit of the night before. I omitted not the\r\nslightest detail, and when I wound up with my request that Addicks get\r\nthe lawyers together and prepare the necessary documents for the\r\nturnover of the bonds and acceptance of Rogers' properties, I felt that\r\nmy share in the Boston gas war was almost ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DUPLICITY OF ADDICKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAddicks looked at me in a cool, aggravating way, as though my enthusiasm\r\nwas a joke.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, you have done a big thing, a big thing, but you put up too many\r\nbonds, altogether too many. It looks to me as though that old trickster\r\nhad got the best of us at last.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time I had learned all the moods of this man and knew that when\r\nhe assumed that air of cold, saturnine jocularity it was safe to look\r\nfor the uncovering of some vaporized trickery. My enthusiasm oozed. I\r\nhastened to ask:\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'too many bonds,' Addicks? I gave him all we had.\r\nSorry it was not more. We are to pay him four and a half million\r\ndollars, and the sooner we do it the better. Now out with what you've\r\ngot in your mind; I won't stand any trifling.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks continued to look at me with the same insolent, critical air. He\r\nsaid slowly:\r\n\r\n\"The reason I say you've given too many bonds is that we haven't a\r\nmillion and a half to put up. Where in the world did you get the idea we\r\nhad?\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant I realized that this sharper had tricked me into\r\napparently tricking Rogers. I was boiling with rage.\r\n\r\n\"You have told me over and over again that you retained the right to\r\nissue a million and a half bonds, that you had never parted with it, and\r\nrelying on your assurances, I have done business with Rogers. Let's have\r\nthe truth now at once.\"\r\n\r\nAddicks is a master in the management of just such tangles as had\r\ndeveloped here. I had expected him to give way before my indignation.\r\nHe looked me square in the eye and turned the tables on me. He got mad\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\"You have taken too much on yourself,\" he began vehemently. \"You had no\r\nright to go ahead without consulting me. Because I've given you full\r\nswing you think you are the whole thing, but you're not. And as for your\r\nrushing in on me without warning and expecting me to let you turn all\r\nthe assets of this corporation over to your new 'Standard Oil' friend, I\r\nwon't stand for it. You can't do this corporation's business that way.\"\r\n\r\nHe poured on for five minutes without giving me a chance to interpose a\r\nword. He seemed to be consumed with anger and paced up and down the\r\noffice. Then suddenly he stopped:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot afford to have any trouble, you and I, Lawson. I'm sure you\r\ndid only what you thought best, but the fact is, I pledged some of those\r\nbonds for our war supplies a few months ago, and though I'm not going to\r\ndispute it with you, I'd swear I told you at the time.\"\r\n\r\nAs Addicks talked I had been mentally reviewing the situation in which I\r\nfound myself. I saw myself dropped out of Rogers' consideration as the\r\nsame kind of a financial trickster that Addicks was. For the moment, I\r\nhad no fight left; I was knocked out.\r\n\r\n\"Don't feel bad, Lawson. You got as far with Rogers as it is possible to\r\nget, and you are dead right when you say that once we get hold of his\r\ncorporation so that every one knows we've licked him, we can easily sell\r\nstock enough to pay him in a few weeks.\" As he talked he was again the\r\nmaster financial trickster, full of device and strategy. Finally I\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"Don't say any more, Addicks. Words won't help us. I've got to face\r\nRogers as soon as a train can take me back to New York, and after\r\nthat--then I'll have something to say to you.\" I started to go.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to say to him?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Say to him? What can I say to him? At my solicitation he gave me a\r\nhearing--at his own home--treated me best in the world. I told him\r\ncertain things, and pledged my word they were truths, and I've got to go\r\nback and tell----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I'm either as big a liar as he says you are or a fool--a doddering\r\nfool.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to do nothing of the kind,\" Addicks declared\r\nperemptorily. \"You're going to tell him that you were not posted up to\r\ndate, and that I, being pressed for money, had pledged some of the\r\nmillion and a half I had told you we had. That's all. He'll see it all\r\nright, and he'll trade for--for--what we have left.\"\r\n\r\nI suddenly remembered that he had not told me how many bonds he had on\r\nhand. Just a ray of hope in the fog.\r\n\r\n\"How many free bonds have we to offer, Addicks, suppose he is willing to\r\noverlook this ugly piece of trickery?\" I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite sure,\" he answered, \"but I can find out from the books.\"\r\nHe rang for Miller, his right-hand man, the dummy treasurer of the Bay\r\nState Company, and said to him: \"Harry, Mr. Lawson has got mixed up\r\nabout the bonds. He thought we had a million and a half. You remember\r\nwe've pledged some in the loans. Just how many have we now on hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry\" looked it up and said: \"Just $904,000 worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you are, Lawson,\" cried Addicks. \"There's plenty to assure Rogers\r\nwe'll do what we agree to.\"\r\n\r\nFool that I was, I did not see his game. No one ever does see Addicks'\r\ngame till it is too late, for no one but a moral idiot would play the\r\ngame Addicks plays, and, thank heaven, moral idiots are so rare in life\r\nthat it is not worth while figuring out the formula from which they\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBy one o'clock I was at Mr. Rogers' office at 26 Broadway.\r\n\r\nHe greeted me warmly. \"Well, Lawson, did you get things finished up all\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, I have a most humiliating admission to----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold up right there. Cut out all explanations and excuses. Have you\r\nbrought those bonds as you agreed to, or not?\" His eyes were snapping\r\nand shifting from one color to another.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not got them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nHad I been a woman I should have clapped my hands to my ears and\r\nscreamed, so sudden and bomb-like came those two words.\r\n\r\n\"He had used some of them and has only $904,000 on hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only $904,000!\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to convey the concentrated scorn and sarcasm Mr. Rogers\r\ninfused into these words, and he continued to glare at me for fully a\r\nminute, his eyes as searching as _x_-rays. When that glare shifted I had\r\na presentiment it would leave me forever a stranger to him, and I made\r\nup my mind to turn on my heel and leave his office without a word. I\r\nfelt that he was in the right, and that if I were in his place I'd\r\nglare, too.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the expression changed. He said peremptorily: \"Lawson, get on\r\nthe first train for Philadelphia and bring back those agreements\r\nexecuted and the $904,000 instead of the $1,500,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I began, but he stopped me with an imperative gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say a word, but do as I tell you. I warned you you were dealing\r\nwith a dog, but you wouldn't have it. Now I'm going to put this trade\r\nthrough even if I make a fool of myself thereby. You've done your work\r\nand that whelp shall not keep you out of its results. I'm in this now,\r\nand we will see if Addicks can outplay me as well as you. Not another\r\nword. I understand the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to Philadelphia deciding once and for all certain things in\r\nregard to Mr. Rogers and others affecting the future of J. Edward\r\nO'Sullivan Addicks; and that night Addicks and I \"had it out.\" I shall\r\nnot attempt to reproduce our talk. Suffice it to state that when I\r\ncalled for the bonds Addicks began to hem and haw, and then I realized\r\nthat he had a second time lied to me. We were in his Philadelphia\r\noffice, and it was night and we were alone. I demanded the truth, and\r\nfinally he told me he had no $904,000 of bonds. As a fact he had not a\r\nsingle bond. He had used them to the last one and had deceived me for\r\nmonths. In regard to this interview Addicks has always maintained that I\r\nlaid hands upon him, and that he was on the verge of doing some awful\r\nthing, but this is false. What I did was to turn the key in the door and\r\nthen, without undue regard to his sensibilities, draw a word-picture of\r\nthe position he had placed me in. Also I said what I thought of him.\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r\nThe vast profits which the stock operator makes apparently overnight are\r\noften subjects for the world's wonder and envy. But if the gains are\r\ngreat, the road is muddy. If those who covet the golden rewards will\r\nparticipate in a deal or two, wallow in the filthy double-dealing which\r\nis an inevitable part of the cost price of success, they will quickly\r\nrealize the dark side of the glittering game, and that the sacrifices\r\nare in proportion to the winnings. If I had been asked that night what\r\nprice would recompense me for the hell Addicks' shabby deceit had\r\nstirred up in me, I should have said--that night--that no number of\r\nmillions would pay for the bitterness of the experience.\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight when I left Addicks' office, and as I walked to my\r\nhotel I was steeped in gloom and bitterness. Before me was the most\r\nhumiliating ordeal with which Fate had ever saddled me. I had to confess\r\nfailure a second time, and under such circumstances that Rogers would be\r\njustified in believing me either a swindler or a dupe unworthy of\r\nrespect or consideration.\r\n\r\nI was at 26 Broadway by ten o'clock the same morning. Mr. Rogers was in\r\nhis main private office. His secretary was with him. He was full of\r\nbusiness, and, I thought, preoccupied. As I entered, and before a word\r\nof greeting passed, he gave me one of his keen, appraising glances.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" was all he said.\r\n\r\n\"Your estimate of Addicks was correct. He has no bonds,\" I said, giving\r\nhim the worst of it at once. I was desperate and certainly in no mood\r\nfor apology. Rogers looked at me. I thought he gasped. He\r\nrushed--whether he pushed or pulled me, or we both slid, or how we got\r\nthere I don't know--but in an instant after I had said \"He has no\r\nbonds\" we were in one of the number of 8 x 12 glass-sided pens he calls\r\nwaiting-rooms, but which the clerks have dubbed \"visitors' sweatboxes.\"\r\nHe put both hands on my shoulders and he yelled--fairly _yelled_: \"Say\r\nthat again! I did not get it.\"\r\n\r\nIn after-years I became on rather playful terms with the extraordinary\r\nbursts of wrath to which Henry H. Rogers occasionally gives way, and\r\nwhich sweep through the \"System's\" shrine like a tornado; but this was\r\nmy first experience, and it was a shock and a revelation. Just what was\r\ngoing to happen next I could not imagine. I remembered afterward that\r\nthe most definite of the impressions that chased each other through my\r\nmind was that Henry H. Rogers would surely have a stroke of apoplexy.\r\nThen that he would \"bust.\" However, I pulled myself together and began:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, what's the use of getting excited?\"\r\n\r\nI got no further. He jumped backward. The next second I was in the\r\nstorm-centre. The room was small. Suddenly it became full of arms and\r\nlegs and hands waving and gesticulating, and fists banging and\r\nbrandishing; gnashing teeth and a convulsed face in which the eyes\r\nactually burned and rained fire; and the language--such a torrent of\r\nvilification and denunciation I have never heard, mingled with oaths so\r\nintense, so picturesque, so varied that the assortment would have driven\r\nan old-time East Indiaman skipper green with jealousy. I was horrified\r\nfor an instant, then surprised, and after that, if it had not been for\r\nmy position as the cause of it all, I should have been interested in the\r\nexhibition as a performance.\r\n\r\nI could hear a stirring and a movement outside. The clerks were\r\nevidently aware of the scene. Forms passed rapidly across the\r\nground-glass walls. After a time Rogers controlled himself. Then he said\r\nto me in a voice still vibrant with passion:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, tell me--put it in short, plain language--do you mean to say\r\nthat after coming to me of your own accord and agreeing to do certain\r\nthings, and then returning here to this very office, admitting that you\r\nhad tricked me; after my overlooking that breach of faith and agreeing\r\nto take half the collateral simply because it was all you could raise,\r\nand because I desired to assist _you_--do you mean to say you have the\r\naudacity to tell me to my face that the whole thing is a lie and you\r\nhave imposed on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, Mr. Rogers, to tell you that Mr. Addicks has just proved to me\r\nthat he has no bonds; that he is a liar and worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is, is he? But does that justify you in coming?--oh!----\"\r\n\r\nAgain he was off. When he stopped for breath I raised my voice and made\r\nit loud and emphatic enough to convince even a man temporarily insane\r\nthat my part as audience and victim had ended. I said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, I can't say more than that I apologize for the part I've\r\nbeen made to play in this transaction, and I'll leave your office\r\nprepared to take any kind of medicine, however harsh it may be, that you\r\nwill deal out on account of all this. Not only will I take it, but I'll\r\nthink you are right in administering it.\"\r\n\r\nRogers once more got himself under control. I stepped toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"One minute, Lawson--one minute. What are you going to do? Go back to\r\nyour associate, that gentlemanly, square-dealing fellow in\r\nPhiladelphia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I replied, \"I ask no mercy at your hands, but there's a\r\nlimit to the things a man will stand under the mess I'm laboring with.\r\nI'm going to do the best I can. What it will be I don't know. There's a\r\ndeal of money at stake--my friends', the public's, my own--I'm\r\nresponsible for it. I've made a terrible blunder. I am paying for it,\r\nbut nothing that has happened has altered my idea of the duty I owe\r\nmyself and others.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to say something sarcastic. Then he choked back the words.\r\nHis manlier nature rose to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"I'm sorry for you. Upon my soul I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be, Mr. Rogers. It's all right; it's part of the game, but\r\nI'm awfully sorry I came near you.\" I opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"One second more, Lawson,\" he said, stopping me and putting out his\r\nhand. \"I'm not only sorry, but I give you my word I have not a\r\ndoubt--no, not a suspicion of your good faith throughout this\r\nbusiness--and if at any time you see your way to open up negotiations,\r\nyou're welcome. Do you understand? You're welcome to come in here or to\r\nmy house at any time you think you see your way out.\"\r\n\r\nI said \"good-by\" and bolted before my feelings overcame me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nENTER H. M. WHITNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that there should now have ensued an interval of\r\nsilence and peace in the Boston gas war. Disheartened, disgusted,\r\ndisappointed, I had to take stock of our position. However enraged I\r\nmight be at the new revelation of Addicks' extraordinary veniality, the\r\nother elements in the situation remained as before. I could see nothing\r\nfor me to do but to resume the tactics I had employed previous to the\r\nmeeting with Rogers. My friends' interests had to be protected, and to\r\ndo that war must be waged until a vulnerable spot in Rogers' armor had\r\nbeen found. But it was some days before I could screw my enthusiasm back\r\nto fighting-pitch. In the mean time Rogers did nothing. He, too, was\r\nwaiting for new developments.\r\n\r\nTo this extent the situation had altered, however: I knew just where I\r\nstood with Rogers, and he realized the consequences of pressing us into\r\na corner. I knew he would sell his company and retire from the field if\r\nI could find a way to pay him for so doing. He knew that if he turned\r\nthe screws too hard I would as a last resort turn the tables by throwing\r\nBay State Gas into bankruptcy. I tried many times and in many ways to\r\nfind means to bring about a termination of the struggle, but to no\r\npurpose. Our extremity was such that it was impossible to do more than\r\nprotect our companies from a receivership. To raise new capital to\r\ndeposit as collateral with Rogers was out of the question, for the\r\npublic, looking on at what was evidently most disastrous warfare, was in\r\nno temper to buy new stock.\r\n\r\nThe lull in our hostilities was only a pause between battles. It\r\nsuddenly came to an end January, 1896, when a new enemy appeared in the\r\nfield. Henry M. Whitney, who had built up Boston's electric\r\nstreet-railway system, and who, from his frequent dealings with the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature in obtaining franchises, had the reputation of\r\ncarrying that body in his waistcoat-pocket, came before this Legislature\r\nwith a proposition for a charter for a new and independent gas company.\r\nUp to this time Whitney had had no relation with the gas public. He\r\nbased his new departure on the claim that he had come into possession of\r\na patented device through which it became possible to turn the low-grade\r\nsulphuric coal of Nova Scotia into coke without sacrificing either the\r\nvaluable by-products, such as ammonia, tar, etc., or illuminating gas.\r\nThis was a very remarkable pretension, for we had long ago eliminated\r\nthese low-grade coals from consideration as material for gas-making; but\r\nif Whitney's device actually was what he claimed, undoubtedly he would\r\nbe a dangerous competitor. Whitney's petition set forth further, that\r\nbecause of the exceedingly low price of this Province coal and its\r\nrichness in by-products he could afford to sell gas to consumers at 50\r\ncents per thousand feet (the legal charge was then $1 per thousand\r\nfeet), a price which would enable the great manufacturing institutions\r\nand all the steam and heating plants to use gas economically for fuel\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe thing was sprung one day and was all over town before night. There\r\nwere interviews and pamphlets floridly setting forth Mr. Whitney's good\r\nintentions toward gas consumers.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney was, and is, one of Boston's most important citizens, at the\r\npresent time president of the Chamber of Commerce, and a brother of the\r\n\"System's\" most Machiavelian votary, the late William C. Whitney. The\r\napplication, backed by his prestige, and the roseate dreams of cheap gas\r\nit conveyed, created a sensation in Boston. Evidently he intended to\r\nhave it seem that the people were in favor of the new charter, for\r\nsimultaneously there appeared notices in the press calling for three\r\ndistinct citizens' meetings. There seemed to be general rejoicing that\r\nat last the odious Standard-Oil Addicks-Bay State Gas outfit with all\r\nits corruption and unwholesome wrangling was to be deposited outside\r\nthe city walls.\r\n\r\nThe experience of any man who has had to do with political and financial\r\naffairs invariably shows him that nothing ever happens of itself.\r\nThunderbolts do descend from clear skies, but an enemy and not nature\r\nhas hurled them. A clever tactician will always look for his\r\nantagonist's hand behind any isolated or detached fluctuation of public\r\nfeeling which bears in the slightest degree upon his problem. In going\r\nover the circumstances, looking for the correct interpretation of the\r\nappearance in our field of this second Richmond, I took into\r\nconsideration the fact that H. M. Whitney was deep in a speculative\r\nventure, Dominion Coal, which owned vast tracts of these low-grade coal\r\nlands in Nova Scotia, and it was known he had been trying vainly to\r\nutilize their products in the locomotives of the Boston & Maine Railroad\r\nand several other ventures in which he was a controlling factor. In one\r\nway it seemed reasonable that if Whitney really had found a way to get\r\nsomething out of his coal, he was justified in making the best possible\r\nuse of it. On the other hand, I could not but see how the new project\r\nbrought about the very situation at which Rogers had so long been\r\naiming. Selling gas at 75 or 50 cents, the new company would absolutely\r\ncommand the business; the old companies must go bankrupt, pass into a\r\nreceiver's hands, and in due course would be absorbed by the Whitney\r\ncorporation. That would leave but one gas company in complete control of\r\nthe Boston field, and it would not be bound to continue the low prices\r\nwhen competition had disappeared, but would be legally free to go back\r\nto the old rates of $1 and $1.25. In a combination which so completely\r\nwent Rogers' way, surely his fine slim Italian hand might be perceived\r\nat the throttle.\r\n\r\nOnce I had made up my mind by what we were confronted, I lost no time.\r\nInquiries revealed that Whitney's alleged control of the Legislature was\r\nnot exaggerated. In fact, it seemed eager to do his bidding in any\r\ndirection. There was no space for negotiation or deliberation, so I\r\nreturned his bomb with another, which, exploding in his breastworks,\r\ncreated as much of a sensation as his own had done. I did not believe\r\nWhitney could do with Nova Scotia coal the things he claimed, but,\r\nwhether or not, if he got his charter, Rogers' object would be\r\naccomplished. If he were absolutely bound, however, under heavy bonds to\r\ndo exactly as he had promised, his proposition would be so loaded that\r\nit might go off in his own hands and blow him to pieces. The next day I\r\nwent personally before the Legislature and agreed to pay the State of\r\nMassachusetts $1,000,000 for the charter Whitney had applied for, and\r\noffered to give bonds to do all the things Whitney would give bonds to\r\ndo on receipt of it.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding caused a halt. It startled the public and set the\r\nWhitney forces agape. My proposition was decidedly novel, and on its\r\nface absurd--the State could not under the law accept a million dollars\r\nor any other sum for its charter--but, on the other hand, it was the\r\nquickest-acting horse-sense producer that could possibly have been\r\nbrought to bear. It was discussed everywhere. Men said: \"Why not? If the\r\nState has a valuable thing to give away, why should it not go to the one\r\nwho will pay the people the most money for it?\" I had outflanked the\r\nenemy, and if he gave battle it would have to be on my conditions.\r\nWhitney was furious, and his privately owned Legislature cursed me for\r\ninterfering with its plans; but he and they recognized my advantage, and\r\nthat night I had a call from Mr. Whitney and his attorney, George Towle.\r\n\r\n\"What are you trying to do, Lawson?\" Whitney asked.\r\n\r\n\"Only trying to protect from destruction the Boston gas companies of\r\nwhich I am vice-president and general manager,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"But my proposition is a perfectly legitimate one,\" Whitney objected. \"I\r\nhave got hold of this invention, which enables me to utilize my Dominion\r\ncoal in such a way that we can make coke out of it, and at the same time\r\nget all the gas. This coal is cheap to produce and costs little per ton\r\nto bring in. So I can sell gas cheaper than you can make it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we have a plant for the manufacture and distribution of gas which\r\nhas cost us seventy years and millions of dollars to get together, and\r\nwe have also the customers to whom you must sell your cheap gas,\" I\r\nreturned. \"If you can really do what you claim, why not go ahead, make\r\nyour gas, and sell it to us? We will distribute it to the people and we\r\nwill divide the profit, and you will make as much as though you did it\r\nall, for you will not have a fight on hand nor be obliged to build up a\r\nduplicate plant. That's all you can do now; you cannot get a charter to\r\nduplicate our plant, because whatever price you offer the Legislature\r\nfor it we will go you a few hundred thousand better.\"\r\n\r\nWe argued for hours. I showed him that if he finally prevailed and got\r\nwhat he was after, his charter would bind him to the absolute fulfilment\r\nof his promise under bonds that would make it unprofitable and\r\ndangerous. He finally made up his mind that such a victory was not worth\r\nwinning, and he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a hitch-up can I make with you and your companies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any fair one,\" I replied. \"This is the situation as I see it, and I'm\r\ngoing to be frank: You say you have a good scheme, but you certainly\r\nhave a Legislature, and you have evidently entered into a compact with\r\nRogers whereby he is to utilize what you have, to knock us on the head.\r\nNow we have fairly checkmated you, and Rogers is out. Seems to me you\r\nowe it to us and yourself to give us the same chance you offered him.\r\nLet us utilize your plans to save ourselves and to knock Rogers on the\r\nhead. But first, are you free to go on with us without explaining things\r\nto 'Standard Oil'?\"\r\n\r\nWhitney assured me that his arrangement with Rogers was tentative,\r\ndepending on whether he could get the charter and could carry out his\r\nother plans.\r\n\r\nAfter some further manoeuvring we agreed that we should withdraw our\r\noffer from the Legislature, that Whitney should secure the new charter,\r\nand that it should be so worded as expressly to allow his company to lay\r\npipes, manufacture, buy or sell gas, and to consolidate any or all of\r\nthe existing or new gas companies in the State of Massachusetts; and\r\nthat when the charter was granted it should belong equally to the\r\nAddicks Boston gas companies and to Whitney. Upon their part the Boston\r\ngas companies would buy of the new company all the gas it produced at\r\nsomething less than it was costing them to manufacture it under the old\r\nprocess. That bound us to nothing dangerous, and we were not forced to\r\ntake Whitney's gas unless he actually got the results he promised.\r\n\r\nAt this time I knew nothing whatever of the workings or the\r\nwire-pullings of State legislatures. My business life had been engaged\r\nat the stock end of corporate transactions, and I had not troubled\r\nmyself about franchises, or how they were obtained, being content to\r\nplay my part with the manufactured product with which we dealt on the\r\nmarket. In a general way I knew political corruption existed. That\r\nRogers had obtained favors for his Brookline Company through bribing\r\nofficials I had good grounds to believe; I had read of strange doings in\r\nconnection with H. M. Whitney's West End Railway franchise obtained from\r\nthe Massachusetts Legislature amid an accompaniment of much public\r\nscandal; but being quite without personal experience I had no clear\r\nconception of how things were done and, innocently enough, I asked\r\nWhitney before we parted:\r\n\r\n\"How is it possible for you to get this valuable charter from the\r\nLegislature, particularly with such a strong and honest man as Roger\r\nWolcott in the governor's chair, when Addicks has been trying\r\ncontinuously for four or five years, regardless of expense, to secure an\r\nordinary one under which he can combine our gas companies?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Towle answered for Whitney:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, that part of the transaction is no affair of yours. Mr. Whitney\r\nwill absolutely guarantee to deliver all those goods, and should it\r\nprove necessary to override the governor in getting them, he will\r\nguarantee to do that too. You can call all that done the minute we sign\r\npapers.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt the new combination was a winner for both of us. If\r\nWhitney got the charter, he would be in a position to make a lot of\r\nmoney out of his Dominion Coal stock, which would surely go up with a\r\nbound in company with Bay State Gas stock when it became known that our\r\ncompanies were in the new deal. Besides, all the talk he would make over\r\nthe value of the charter would help create a market for new stock which\r\nwe would issue for the purpose of obtaining funds to buy Rogers out.\r\nLater, if Whitney's invention was what he imagined, his own profit would\r\nrun into millions and our properties, having the sole right to\r\ndistribution, would be stronger than ever. That meant resuscitation of\r\nBay State Gas, and that all the stocks and bonds held by my friends and\r\nthe public would return splendid profits.\r\n\r\nI tested the scheme in all its aspects and found only one weak spot in\r\nit. We, the Boston companies, were to \"go snags\" with Whitney in the\r\nresults of a legislative game in which he was to bear the expense of\r\ngetting a charter, and as Whitney and Towle said it was to cost them\r\n$250,000 to $300,000 to get it, it looked as if there would be some\r\nnasty business done at the State House.\r\n\r\nI do not set up for a saint, nor to possessing exclusive virtues which\r\ndistinguish me from the ordinary American citizen who does business for\r\ngain. In reiterating that the bribery end of our \"hitch-up\" with Whitney\r\ndid not appeal to me, I am neither pluming nor crowning myself; I am\r\nmerely stating a fact. This was an emergency, however, I could not\r\nregard as a mere personal concern. It was my duty to care for the\r\ninterests of a great property which must not be endangered by my\r\nscruples, and I was willing to be advised by my business friends in the\r\nmatter. I went round among my most conservative banking, business, and\r\nnewspaper connections and put hypothetical questions to them bearing on\r\nmy difficulty. In nearly all instances the replies were the same, and\r\nthe subject seemed to be regarded as a joke--what were legislatures for,\r\nanyway, but to be \"fixed\"? All who did business with legislatures\r\n\"fixed\" them, and Whitney was certainly the star \"fixer.\" I frankly\r\nstated that I considered bribing a legislator as a low-down crime and\r\nthat I did not believe it was done in our strait-laced old Commonwealth\r\nas freely as they all seemed to imagine. Thereupon I was sarcastically\r\nreferred to my Bell Telephone, New Haven, and Boston & Maine Railroad\r\nfriends, to the organizers of trust companies, and to many other\r\nrepresentative pillars of social and business society who had had\r\noccasion to deal with the State. I started at once a round of\r\ninvestigation among men who would talk frankly to me, and discovered\r\nthat a most iniquitous condition existed. Massachusetts senators and\r\nrepresentatives were not only bought and sold as sausages or fish are in\r\nthe markets, but there existed a regular quotation schedule for their\r\nvotes. Many of the prominent lawyers of the State were traffickers in\r\nlegislation, and earned large fees engineering the repeal of old laws\r\nand the passage of new ones. Agents of corporations nominated candidates\r\nfor office, and paid the expenses of their election in return for votes\r\nfor a favorite measure and promises to \"do business.\" The Legislature\r\nwas organized on the same basis; its executive officers were chosen\r\nbecause of their subservience to certain corporation leaders; committees\r\nwere rigged to do given things and prevent other things from being done.\r\nAbove all, I learned that the chance of a citizen of Massachusetts\r\nobtaining a charter from the Legislature of his State, unless he had\r\nmoney to put up for it, was about as good as a hobo's of securing a\r\ndiamond and ruby studded crown at Tiffany's by explaining that he wanted\r\nit. In fact, the citizen's request would be regarded by senators and\r\nrepresentatives very much as Tiffany's would regard the hobo's--as a\r\njoke first, then as an impertinence.\r\n\r\nRight here I desire to say to my readers and especially to all those\r\nhypocritical and ignorant people who, imagining any strong statement\r\nmust express a strong prejudice and not a fact, will cry, \"He\r\noverstates! He exaggerates!\" that in years after when I had full\r\nopportunity to study at close range the Massachusetts Legislature, its\r\nworkings and those who worked it, all the impressions I had received at\r\nthis time were absolutely confirmed. I do not hesitate to state, then,\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n_The Massachusetts Legislature is bought and sold as are sausages and\r\nfish at the markets and wharves. That the largest, wealthiest, and most\r\nprominent corporations in New England, whose affairs are conducted by\r\nour most representative citizens, habitually corrupt the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature, and the man of wealth connected with such corporations who\r\nwould enter protest against the iniquity would be looked on as a \"class\r\nanarchist.\" I will go further and state that if in New England a man of\r\nthe type of Folk, of Missouri, can be found who, after giving over six\r\nmonths to turning up the legislative and Boston municipal sod of the\r\npast ten years, does not expose to the world a condition of rottenness\r\nmore rotten than was ever before exhibited in any community in the\r\ncivilized world, it will be because he has been suffocated by the stench\r\nof what he exhumes._\r\n\r\nTo return to my story, after my investigations I again saw Whitney and\r\nTowle, and they, not relishing my remarks on the subject of bribery,\r\ntold me frankly to attend to my own part of the affair and leave their\r\npart to them. At this stage I called in Addicks, our corporation\r\ncounsel, and some of the largest holders of Bay State bonds and stock,\r\nand put before them the bargain I had arranged with Whitney. They all\r\nagreed it was an excellent combination, and ratified the terms I had\r\nproposed to Whitney. It was further agreed that Whitney should make over\r\nto us one-half ownership in the new company, which we were to transfer\r\nto the Bay State Company after the charter had been granted.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason at this stage in the deal to regard victory as\r\nassured, for it did look as though the flapping sails on our\r\nmuch-buffeted and battered craft were at last to be filled with a lusty\r\nbreeze strong enough to carry us to the harbor we had so long been\r\ntrying to make. Besides what we ourselves could do and had already done,\r\nwe now had Whitney for an ally in the deal, and certainly he was a\r\nstock-selling power throughout New England. He had agreed to go before\r\nthe Legislature and the public, and pledge his word that his scheme\r\nwould do all the wonderful things he had promised for it.[8] And when\r\namid acclamation the charter was awarded and it became known that we\r\nwere its beneficiaries, I could see our stock soaring.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] As a matter of fact, he did, later, in the peroration of an eloquent\r\naddress before a public legislative hearing, electrify the law-makers with:\r\n\"I here and now pledge my word, my fortune, and my sacred honor to the\r\nfulfilment of these promises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nAN AWKWARD ATTACK OF APPENDICITIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no walk of life is that head-light axiom, \"Man proposes, God\r\ndisposes,\" so often flashed plump in the eyes of enthusiastic travellers\r\nfor their bewilderment or befuddlement as in finance. At this very\r\nmoment of success I was, without knowing it, on the brink of ruin, owing\r\nto causes and conditions which were beyond human power to calculate or\r\nforesee. Here is what happened:\r\n\r\nAll the details of our bargain having at last been agreed upon verbally,\r\nit was proper the principals should get together and formally execute\r\nthe documents which should bind the trade. We arranged to meet on a\r\ngiven Saturday at the beautiful stock-farm of Parker C. Chandler, Esq.,\r\nthe Bay State's general counsel, and as secrecy was important, a special\r\ntrain was to take the party the twenty-five miles out of Boston. By an\r\nunavoidable accident I missed the train, and in driving over the road in\r\na bleak rain-storm, caught a violent cold. I was about three hours late,\r\nbut when I arrived we went to work with a will and by seven o'clock,\r\nshortly before dinner, our contracts had been dictated to the\r\nstenographers and would be typed, ready to sign, by the time we came to\r\nour coffee.\r\n\r\nThat dinner was a thing to be remembered. No one in New England\r\nunderstands more admirably the art of dining than does Parker Chandler,\r\nand he gave us a feast worthy to celebrate the brilliant new combination\r\nwhich was to end all our troubles and lead us out of darkness into the\r\nlight. As the cheese was being served I was seized suddenly with a\r\nterrible pain, which was followed by convulsions. They carried me to a\r\nbedroom; lawyers and capitalists went scurrying after doctors, and in\r\nthe confusion the documents which were all ready awaiting execution were\r\nput aside. It was obvious that at that moment I could not O.K. them. At\r\nlast specialists from Boston arrived and it was diagnosed that I was\r\nsuffering from an aggravated attack of appendicitis. At two o'clock in\r\nthe morning, after a prolonged consultation, the consensus of opinion\r\nwas that my next field of operations would be in another world.\r\n\r\nIt must have been some time a little later that I, awaking to a brief\r\ninterval of consciousness, witnessed a tableau, the memory of which\r\ninvariably rises to my mind's eye whenever I try to mitigate or subdue\r\nmy feelings of hatred and disgust for Addicks. The room was dimly lit;\r\nthe two doctors were at the foot of the bed; Addicks, standing beside\r\nthem, was looking fixedly at me. I caught his eye; doped as I was with\r\nopiates I saw the cold, calculating expression of his face, which told\r\nme as plainly as words that he felt it was all up with me, that my\r\nusefulness to him was at an end, and that without a thought for my\r\ninterests or a scintilla of regret, he was calculating how to turn my\r\ndeath to his advantage. An amused conviction of the man's heartlessness\r\ncrept over me, and then I passed out into the land of dreams.\r\n\r\nFrom that night until one bright morning ten days later, I was visiting\r\nother worlds than those of finance and gas; but on the tenth day they\r\ntold me I had eluded the grim ferryman and, barring accident, might get\r\nout into the world again in five weeks. A suspicion which owed its\r\norigin to that glimpse of Addicks on the first night of my illness\r\nawakened in my mind, and the following day I sent for my principal\r\nattorney and demanded an exact statement of what had happened in the\r\ninterval of my illness. He had kept close track of all that had\r\noccurred, and the facts he revealed, calloused as I was to the thought\r\nof Addicks' baseness, horrified me by their cold-blooded villany. My\r\nassociates had gone ahead with a vengeance, without waiting a minute to\r\nsee whether I should live or die. My offer to the Legislature had been\r\nwithdrawn; Addicks had substituted his name for mine in all the\r\ndocuments, and then he had traded with Rogers. It had been arranged\r\nbetween them that Whitney should go on and get the charter, which was to\r\nallow the company to sell gas at any price, for it was not to be under\r\nthe supervision of the gas commissioners, who had pledged the public\r\nthat the price of gas in Boston should not ever be more than $1 per one\r\nthousand feet. This obtained, a new corporation was to be organized,\r\ninto which Rogers would merge his companies, and Addicks our Boston\r\nproperties, in such a way as to leave Bay State stock and bondholders\r\nhigh and dry, while Addicks, Whitney, and Rogers reaped tremendous\r\nprofits. These amiable plans were being hammered into shape at top\r\nspeed, and unless I could get into harness at once, my friends and I\r\nwould most certainly be ground up. Head-quarters had been opened at the\r\nAlgonquin Club, and there Addicks, Whitney, Towle, and the lawyers and\r\nlobbyists were holding day and night sessions.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing for me to do, and I lost not a moment. I sent\r\nfor my doctors and said: \"I will devote to-day, to-morrow, and next day\r\nto getting well; but on the fourth day I will be moved in a special car\r\nto Boston and then to the Algonquin Club.\" I explained the situation and\r\nshowed them that regardless of all consequences this must be done.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the expression on the faces of these loyal\r\nassociates of mine--Addicks, Whitney, and the others--when I dropped in\r\nupon their deliberations Saturday morning, four days later. My doctor, a\r\nnurse, and my lawyer accompanied me, and I was swathed in flannels and\r\nshawls. I got to a chair, dismissed my attendants, and launched in. What\r\nlittle I had to say would be brief, I told them, but \"edgy.\" It was all\r\nthat. I insisted that we should go right back to our old bargain exactly\r\nat the place we had left it the night I was taken ill. If they did not\r\ncomply, I would make application for a receiver for the Bay State\r\ncompanies and give to the afternoon papers the inside facts of the\r\naffair from beginning to end. No one doubted either my ability or my\r\ndetermination to carry out my threat. We sent for the documents that had\r\nbeen prepared at Parker Chandler's, and inside of three hours these had\r\nbeen substituted and the several agreements entered into with Rogers\r\nformally renounced. I retired to bed that night with a chuckle of\r\nself-satisfaction, and a convincing appreciation of the truth of the\r\naxiom I have referred to.\r\n\r\nThe low-down treachery and double-dealing characterizing this\r\ntransaction, the utter callousness to sacred obligations it exhibits in\r\nmen of presumed high standing and personal honor, may surprise my\r\nreaders. I assure them that several such episodes will be told in the\r\nforthcoming pages of this history. Indeed, among a certain school of\r\neminent financiers, loyalty is no more than devotion to the opportunity\r\nof making the highest profit. If circumstances shift this from the side\r\nof their enlistment to that of an adversary, their arms and hearts go\r\nwhere their pockets lead. It must be remembered that the Hessian who\r\n\"down-town\" is steeped in perfidy, trickery, and fraud, may appear\r\nbefore the \"up-town\" world as a Christian citizen and an example of\r\ndomestic virtue. The type is not uncommon nowadays of the pleasant and\r\nproper gentleman, prompt to knock down any one daring to asperse his\r\nveracity after five any evening and all day Sunday, but who considers\r\nhimself free to engage in any dirty juggle or misrepresentation from 9\r\nA.M. to 4.45 P.M. In office hours you run no risk in calling him a liar,\r\nfor then he'll laugh at the joke and tell you business is business.\r\nHowever, the foregoing episode was an experience that left an indelible\r\nimpression on my mind, and the hatred and disgust it engendered\r\nprecipitated events out of which in the course of years came the\r\noffences and injuries that are responsible for the story of \"Frenzied\r\nFinance.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate results of my reappearance were not startling. Rogers\r\nraved at Addicks and especially at Whitney, but he was too old a student\r\nof men, and the monkeys Dame Fortune makes of them, to sulk over the\r\nfacts he could not remedy. He soon resumed his former attitude of\r\nwaiting for something to turn up, which indeed he had maintained ever\r\nsince my unsuccessful effort to make terms with him.\r\n\r\nFate had not yet tired, however, of playing shuttlecock with our hopes.\r\nThe world learned one morning of a new gas called acetylene, clear,\r\nbrilliant, cheap, and simply made from calcium carbide. It would surely\r\nrevolutionize gas-making the world over, and the company which could\r\nsecure the right to it would have those who could not at its mercy.\r\nAddicks moved like a flash to gather in the advantage, and the\r\nannouncement that the new gas had been proved a success was coupled in\r\nthe press with the news that the Bay State Gas had captured the\r\ninvention for New England, and was to pay millions for it. This did give\r\na boost to our securities, and for a time it looked as though we had\r\nclinched our success with another rivet. What Addicks had done was this:\r\nHe had bought the right, subject to the test of a big public\r\ndemonstration. For this demonstration a fine flare-up was arranged.\r\nEminent mayors, counsellors, and gas magnates were to attend in\r\nmultitude, and if the invention met its engagements, there would be such\r\na blaze of publicity and congratulations that we felt sure our new stock\r\nwould go off like hot cakes. The demonstration proved in a most\r\nsensational way that acetylene was a failure--a tremendous explosion\r\noccurred; three men were killed, many others injured, and next day back\r\nwent our stock to its old figures.\r\n\r\nAll this time I had sought most diligently for the real solution of our\r\ntroubles--a method of purchasing Rogers' companies. A substantial\r\nguarantee there must be, not only for the performance of our financial\r\nengagements but to insure to Rogers the integrity of his properties\r\nwhile under the domination of Addicks. The difficulty was, in the\r\nweakened condition of the company, to put together any satisfactory\r\nguarantee. Others in our group had wrestled with the problem as\r\nstrenuously as I had. Suddenly, a few days before May, 1896, the light\r\ncame to me. All the time the solution had been in our hands, and, beset\r\nas we were, it had never occurred to any of us. We absolutely controlled\r\nthe old Boston gas companies. They were intrinsically among the richest\r\ncorporations in Massachusetts, and although their stocks were pledged\r\nfor the $12,000,000 of bonds held by the public, they did not owe a\r\ndollar. Though the terms of the agreement between the Bay State Company\r\nand the Mercantile Trust, which held their shares, precluded them from\r\ncontracting any debts, they were empowered, through us, their officials,\r\nto buy or sell gas, and all their great wealth was behind such\r\ncontracts. If, then, we agreed on their behalf to buy gas of the\r\nBrookline Company for a term of years at such a price and in sufficient\r\nquantities to give the latter concern a profit equal to ten per cent.\r\ndividends on its stock, surely we had complied with the very letter of\r\nRogers' exaction. Testing the idea in one way and another, I found it\r\nsound as a bell. The problem after that was to get into shape for the\r\nsubstantial issue of new stock we must make to pay for our purchase. The\r\nbanks and trust companies were loaded up with our securities pledged for\r\nloans, and before there could be any conviction behind our prosperity it\r\nbehooved us to get all our valuables out of pawn. I went to Mr. Rogers\r\nand frankly told him I had solved our problem and his by a financial\r\ninvention of my own. I entered into the details of our plan, explaining\r\nit would not even be necessary for us to buy any gas of him, because we\r\nwould turn over a sufficient number of our own customers to the\r\nBrookline Company to secure to it the required profit. He saw in an\r\ninstant the scheme with all its far-reaching possibilities, and\r\nassented. Then I broached the rest of my plan--we would pay him four and\r\na half millions in six months. To do this we must sell stocks and bonds.\r\nBefore we could do that it was necessary that he help us still\r\nfurther--he must buy of us all the bonds now in pledge and the stock of\r\nthe Dorchester Gas Company, another Bay State asset up for security, all\r\nfor the sum of a million and a half dollars. For this amount these\r\nsecurities would at once be released and turned over to him. Then he\r\nshould resell them to us together with the Brookline Gas Company for six\r\nmillions of dollars. There would be a formal turning over of the\r\nmanagement of his properties so the public should be convinced that we\r\nreally were the victors in the strife. Mr. Rogers saw my point, quickly\r\nran over the details in his comprehensive way, and closed the trade\r\nwithout further bargaining. That time, thank Heaven, it was not within\r\nAddicks' power to thwart me.\r\n\r\nOn May 1st we made our settlement in compliance with the terms I had\r\narranged. The six millions of dollars were to be paid November 1st. As\r\nthe necessary options and sales could not legally run to our company,\r\nthey were made to Henry M. Whitney, and he simultaneously transferred\r\nthem to us, and we elected him a director of our different corporations.\r\nRogers publicly resigned and turned over to us the control of the\r\nBrookline Company, and we elected our own management. To all intents and\r\npurposes we had won.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was the sensation of the day in financial circles, and I\r\nwas the recipient of many generous congratulations. I had neither time\r\nnor inclination to take care of bouquets at that moment, however. I was\r\ntoo keenly aware of the difficulty of raising six millions of dollars in\r\nthe limited period at our disposal. Times have changed since 1896. Then\r\nsix millions was quite a large sum, larger than sixty millions now. That\r\nwas before the halcyon period of \"Frenzied Finance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nBRIBING A LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat six months between May 1st and November 1st was the most crowded\r\nperiod in all my experience up to that time. Events of consequence\r\ntumbled over one another in startling succession. We actually lived on\r\nsensations. In exercising the historian's right to choose the order of\r\nsetting down incidents I am puzzled as to which to give precedence.\r\nShall I begin with the sensational bribery of the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature which occurred within this period, or with the episode that\r\nwas the exciting climax of that interval of trial? About this time, too,\r\noccurred the laying of the foundation of \"Coppers\" and Amalgamated, but\r\nthat certainly requires a chapter to itself. However, as all are starry\r\nexamples of what made \"Frenzied Finance\" possible, and as any one fits\r\ninto my story as well ahead as behind the other two, I'll take them in\r\nthe succession above set down.\r\n\r\nThe Whitney machine for the manufacture and moulding of legislation was\r\ncomplex but efficient. It achieved its wonders in broad daylight.\r\nConsidering all it did and how that all was accomplished, the\r\nastonishing fact is that no outcry to speak of was ever raised at its\r\nperformances. It was vastly bolder than Tammany and made fewer excuses\r\nfor its grabbings. It must be remembered, however, that its chief\r\nengineer was a leading citizen, and his assistants all gentlemen of\r\ngreat respectability and admirable antecedents, and, in Boston, social\r\nand civic distinctions are shields behind which much may be concealed.\r\n\r\nCorrupting a Legislature is not something a man may do with a fillip of\r\nhis finger and thumb. However bold the operations, the convenances must\r\nbe observed. When really large designs are entertained, the manipulator\r\nsets to before the preceding election and has his \"lawyers\" at work\r\nthroughout the country interviewing candidates and ascertaining their\r\nfeelings. Thus a certain percentage of votes are signed and sealed in\r\nadvance, ready for delivery at the proper time. But there is always a\r\ncrowd of new men who must be taken care of on the spot, and these must\r\nbe approached with tact. Some amateurs have fanatical notions of honor\r\nwhich interfere with both their own and the interests of\r\nfranchise-grabbers. To deal with all contingencies, to take care of\r\ncaptured votes and to shape legislative proceedings along safe lines,\r\nrequires the services of almost an army of men.\r\n\r\nAt the head of Whitney's forces was his lawyer, George H. Towle, big of\r\nbrain, ponderous of frame, and with the strength of an ox. A man of\r\nterrific temper, he knew not the meaning of the word fear. Nothing\r\naroused him to such frenzy as to have to do with a legislator who\r\nunnecessarily haggled over the price of his vote or influence. On\r\noccasions when a lieutenant reported that Senator This or Representative\r\nThat would not come into camp, Towle, with an oath, would say: \"Take me\r\nto him, and I'll have his vote in ten minutes or there'll be occasion\r\nfor a new election in his district to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nSecond in command was Mr. Patch, Towle's secretary and factotum, his\r\nexact opposite in every way. Where Towle was brutally straight to the\r\npoint, Mr. Patch was as smooth an intriguer as ever connected himself\r\nwith secrets by way of keyholes and transoms. It is a Beacon Hill\r\ntradition that for years Towle on final-payment day would have the\r\nmembers of the Massachusetts Legislature march through his private\r\noffices one at a time, and, handing each of them their loot, would\r\nproclaim: \"Well, you're settled with in full, aren't you? That\r\nrepresents your vote on ---- and on ----.\" Then he would loudly identify\r\nthe bill and the particulars of the service, while behind a partition\r\nwith a stenographer would be Mr. Patch, who after the notes had been\r\nwritten out would witness the accuracy of the stenographer's report.\r\nWhen the Legislature assembled again, old members, the same story goes,\r\nwould be requested to call on Towle to renew acquaintanceship. Then he\r\nwould allow them to look over his memoranda \"just to keep them from\r\nbeing too honest,\" as he gently phrased it.\r\n\r\nSubordinate to Towle and Patch was a long line of eminently respectable\r\nlawyers known over the Commonwealth as \"Whitney's attorneys.\" These men\r\nassisted at nominations, orated at elections, and took care of the finer\r\npreliminary details. The first line of attack was composed of practical\r\npoliticians of various grades--ex-senators or representatives, and local\r\nbosses, who were known as \"Whitney's right-hand men.\" Below these were\r\nthe ordinary lobbyists, the detectives, and runners, who kept \"tabs\" on\r\nevery move and deed, day and night, of the members of the Legislature.\r\nThis was the Whitney machine, and it worked together with that fine\r\nsolidity and evenness which can be attained only by constant practice\r\nand much success. In comparison with this competent organization, an\r\naverage \"Tammany Gang,\" a \"Chicago Combine,\" or a \"St. Louis Syndicate\"\r\nwould look like a hay-covered snow-plough in August.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom the public is given an opportunity of seeing a picture,\r\ndrawn to life, of the Legislature of one of the greatest States in the\r\nUnion in the act of being bribed to grant the votaries of \"Frenzied\r\nFinance,\" for nothing, those things which should and do belong to the\r\npeople, and for which the \"System's\" votaries would willingly pay\r\nmillions of dollars if they were compelled to. I shall dwell on the\r\nperformance that ensued at this juncture of my story long enough to\r\npresent an outline of such a proceeding.\r\n\r\nHead-quarters for Whitney's Massachusetts Pipe Line were opened at\r\nYoung's Hotel--Parlors 9, 10, and 11, Rooms 6, 7, 8, second story front.\r\nParlors 9 and 10 were the general reception-room, while 11 was reserved\r\nfor the commander himself and for important and \"touchy\" interviews. The\r\nrooms 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 were used for educational purposes. In the morning\r\nthe place was deserted, but at noon the parlors began to fill up with\r\nthe different officers of the \"Machine\" and their friends, trustworthy\r\nmembers of the Legislature. A little later an elaborate luncheon would\r\nbe served, the supernumeraries eating in one room, Towle and his chiefs\r\nand the legislators in the other. At table the gossip of the morning\r\nsession at the State House was exchanged and the work laid out for the\r\nafternoon legislative and committee sessions. Another interval of\r\nsilence and peace until at 5.30 the real business of the day began. Mr.\r\nPatch was generally on the ground first, carrying the books in which the\r\nbribery records were kept, for be it remembered that the efficiency of\r\nthe Whitney machine was largely due to the thoroughly systematic manner\r\nin which its operations were conducted. Nothing was left to chance or to\r\nany one's memory. In turn, the subordinates presented careful reports of\r\nthe day's transactions. At 6.30 Mr. Towle would go over these documents,\r\n\"sizing up\" the actual results for submission later to the chief\r\nhimself. Between 7.30 and 8.30 the \"Machine\" dined; the remains of the\r\nfeast having been removed, the doors were locked and the books brought\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIf an outsider could possibly have obtained the entry to the\r\nhead-quarters of the Whitney Massachusetts Pipe Line, say at nine\r\no'clock any evening during the session, he might easily have imagined\r\nhimself at the Madison Square Garden or at Tattersall's on the evening\r\nof the first day of an international horse-sale. This is what he would\r\nhave seen: In Parlor 10, seated at a long table a dozen of Mr. Towle's\r\nchiefs, all in their shirt-sleeves, smoking voluminously; before each a\r\nsheet of paper on which is printed a list of the members of the\r\nLegislature; against every name a blank space for memoranda; at the head\r\nof the table Towle himself, frowning severely over a similar sheet\r\nhaving broader memoranda-spaces. One after another the chiefs call off\r\nthe names of the legislators, reporting as they go along. The outsider\r\nwould have heard droned monotonously: \"..... from ..... not my man;\r\n..... from ..... my man and .....'s man; seen to-day, stood same as\r\nyesterday; ..... from ....., raised price $20, making it $150; agreed;\r\n$10 paid on account, total of $90 due; raised because ..... told him\r\nthat he had got $20 more from .....\"\r\n\r\nAs each man reports the other chiefs and Towle discuss the details, and\r\nwhen a decision on disputed points is arrived at, Towle makes a\r\nmemorandum on his blank, and the chief concerned records the order in\r\nthe little note-book which each carries. All reports at last in, Towle\r\nretires to Room 11 and speedily returns with the \"stuff,\" consisting of\r\ncash, stocks, puts, calls, or transportation tickets, which he deals out\r\nto the chiefs to make good their promises for the day. It would have\r\nbeen obvious to the outsider, as soon as he had learned what was being\r\ndealt in, that a large proportion of the members of the Great and\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts had bargained with the different members\r\nof \"the machine\" to sell their votes not only in committee but in full\r\nsession of the Legislature, and that the price was to be paid when the\r\nvotes were cast, though something was invariably exacted on account, to\r\ntie the bargain. Payment was made in cash, calls on Bay State Gas or\r\nDominion Coal, or transportation on any of the railroads in the United\r\nStates or Canada. The latter appears to be a class of remuneration Towle\r\nfavored, probably because it cost nothing.\r\n\r\nThe conference seldom closed for the day without Towle admonishing his\r\nsubordinates: \"The old man's getting dead sore at the way his leg is\r\nbeing pulled, and if you fellows don't get those countrymen to play a\r\nmore liberal game, they'll just drive the boss out of the business, and\r\nthen there'll be a slump in prices that'll make them prefer to stay home\r\nand farm.\"\r\n\r\nYou may ask here, Could such things happen without attracting public\r\nattention? Or are the citizens of Boston so habituated to the corruption\r\nof their Legislature that they could witness unmoved this wholesale\r\nbribing campaign conducted in full daylight from Young's Hotel? Thank\r\nHeaven, this is not so. There are in every American community honest,\r\nsturdy souls who can be depended on to come forward in emergencies and\r\ncry out aloud against a threatened political crime. Above the brute\r\nhubbub of a city's roar their voices are heard like the voice of\r\nconscience, and the hurrying throng pauses a second in its mad rush\r\nafter dollars to listen to their tale of the Commonwealth's wrong. But\r\nwhat's in the air is not on earth. The practical politicians, whose\r\naffair it is to heed and counteract these honorable protests, laugh\r\ncontemptuously at the vanity of any contest between theories and the\r\n\"stuff.\" They know the overpowering logic of gold.\r\n\r\nThere were public meetings in Boston; good-government clubs throughout\r\nthe State met and \"resoluted\"; citizens' organizations howled robbery\r\nand malfeasance. For a few weeks all Massachusetts seemed wrought up.\r\nFrom the space the papers gave the protestants one might have imagined\r\nthat there was a chance for virtue, but the results of the clamor were\r\nmore apparent than real. Day by day, night by night, the \"machine\"\r\nground away at Young's, and as its product fell into the hopper Whitney\r\nand Towle only smiled at the clamor and awaited the moment when, as\r\nTowle coarsely put it, \"the reformers would have yawped themselves to a\r\nstandstill.\"\r\n\r\nThat day came at last. One by one, all in a perfectly orderly and\r\nmethodical manner, the giving-bonds-to-compel-promises clauses,\r\nrestrictive amendments and other people's safeguards had been voted down\r\nand the \"Are you ready for the main question?\" having been put in both\r\nhouses, the Massachusetts Pipe Line Charter was duly passed and sent on\r\nto the governor. It required his signature to make the bill a\r\nhard-and-fast law, and that once appended, all Towle's \"promises to pay\"\r\nbecame due.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign neared a finish Whitney had, a number of times, informed\r\nhis chiefs, and they the members of the Legislature, that the governor\r\nhad given personal assurance that if the bill passed both houses, he\r\nwould sign it. On this score all interested had been relieved of doubt,\r\nand immediately upon the Senate's favorable action Bay State and\r\nDominion Coal shares advanced in price. During the period the governor\r\nhad the bill under consideration there was an active and rising market\r\nand a great volume of transactions on the Stock Exchange. Apparently the\r\nday of our peace and prosperity had dawned at last. But we were not yet\r\nout of a gnarled Fate's clutches.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a strenuous forenoon of trading, suddenly, without the\r\nslightest warning, both stocks began to sink in price like pigs of lead\r\nfrom a capsized boat. At once I was on the defensive. To prevent a wild\r\nmarket panic during the few minutes consumed in getting telephone\r\nconnection with the State House, I had to purchase thousands of shares.\r\nI knew that something disastrous had happened, but was not prepared for\r\nthe startling information that came over the wire: \"The governor has\r\nvetoed the Whitney bill with a savage message.\" My informant told me\r\nthat Towle and his men were making for head-quarters on a run. As I hung\r\nup the receiver, the bell rang again. In a second my telephone with\r\nWhitney's office was in the middle of a spasm.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got the news, Lawson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I got it? The tape is screaming it.[9] Bay State and your stock\r\nare racing for the bottom,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do? This is a thunderbolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\" I replied. \"It's for you to say what to do. That's your end, not\r\nmine, but from now until three o'clock one thing you must do, or\r\nthere'll be no further thinking on the subject--protect Dominion\r\nCoal--have your brokers on the floor every second and tell them to buy\r\nall that's offered. Beat a slow retreat if you must, but prevent a wild\r\nbreak. Things at the Exchange are bad now. I'll take care of Bay State.\r\nLook out for Dominion at once, and when you are through I must see\r\nyou--where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Young's in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be there.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later I was in Whitney's head-quarters. There pandemonium\r\nreigned; all the cocksureness and bluster of the \"machine\" had vanished,\r\nand it was a horde of clamorous and excited men I found struggling round\r\nTowle and Whitney, who vainly sought to stay the panic. It was not\r\ndisappointment at the governor's message that had so stirred these\r\nhardened practitioners of politics, but the terror of impending loss.\r\nThe majority of the Whitney band, lawyers, lieutenants, and\r\nwater-carriers had bought one stock or both on margin, and had assured\r\ntheir friends it was safe to plunge to the limit.\r\n\r\nOn earth there is no more pitiable sight than the panic of a herd of\r\nnovice stock-speculators suddenly awakened to a realization of their\r\nruin. The ticker clicks a sort of death-watch as the merciless tape,\r\nwithout hitch or let up, reels off destruction. To such desperate beings\r\nthe stock operator--the market-maker--is the straw to save them from\r\ndrowning, and to him they turn as the one possible source of aid and\r\nhope. I only knew these men at sight's end, but they knew me and were\r\nsure in their abject plight that I could help them--by what wizardry\r\nthey never stopped to think. They were terribly certain that unless the\r\nmarket turned, their brokers must have additional margin or their stock\r\nwould be thrown overboard, sinking prices still lower and bringing down\r\ntheir friends' stock, and so on, like a row of falling bricks.\r\n\r\nFrom their comfortable viewpoint of out-of-temptation virtue, my readers\r\nmay regard these lawyers, lieutenants, and water-carriers of Whitney as\r\nbad men, deserving of no sympathy, meeting here a righteous punishment;\r\nbut, my word for it--and I know the world and the human ants and spiders\r\nwho inhabit it--while they bore no marks of immorality, they were the\r\naverage men one meets in one's journey over the bridge between the two\r\nunknowns.\r\n\r\nMy talk with Whitney and Towle was brief and pointed. It was no time for\r\npow-wow. It was the moment for action. Men who do things in\r\nstock-markets never waste time over milk that is in the gutter. How to\r\nget new milk to replace that spilt is their care.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do, Mr. Whitney?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nGeorge Towle started to explain. I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"The market is bad,\" I said, talking quickly. \"If time is dribbled, it\r\nwill be worse, and--and Boston will be a warm place for you, Towle. It\r\nwould not surprise me if it got warm even for Mr. Whitney, when the\r\ndesperate men who are filling the brokerage shops and the corridors\r\noutside demand a reason why they were egged on to buy stocks on Mr.\r\nWhitney's word that the governor would sign. No excuses now; I want to\r\nknow from Mr. Whitney just what he proposes to do. You both told me the\r\nlegislative end was none of my business, and, thank Heaven, it was not.\r\nYou said it was your business. Now, how about it?\"\r\n\r\nHenry M. Whitney is a great general. He also can light his cigar, when\r\nthe battle's on, with the friction of a passing cannon-ball.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to pass it over the governor's veto,\" he instantly answered.\r\n\r\n\"Can you do it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can, for I must.\" He meant it. It needed but one look into his and\r\nTowle's eyes to see they both had read the message on the back of\r\nTo-morrow's visiting-card.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Let your people have the word, and it must have no\r\ndoubtful ring; tell your brokers to buy Dominion Coal, and don't let\r\nthem stand on the order of their buying. Dominion Coal must be put back,\r\nregardless of how much it costs or how little you want what you must\r\nbuy. I will turn Bay State before three if it is necessary to trade in\r\nthe whole capital stock to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAs I came out of Parlor 11 to rush back to my office I said to the\r\ndespairing men who crowded the corridor outside the head-quarters, and\r\nwho had in their desperation thrown all caution or thought of\r\nconcealment to the winds: \"Coal and Gas look to me like good buys.\" The\r\nsudden revulsion of feeling was pathetic. In a minute the news had\r\nspread by way of them to their brokers and their suffering friends:\r\n\"It's all right; Whitney and Lawson are buying stock.\" It got to the\r\nExchange almost as soon as I did.\r\n\r\nWe turned the market.\r\n\r\nThat night Whitney and Towle's plans were mapped out to the army and\r\ntheir orders despatched with a vicious snap that plainly said: \"Whoever\r\nattempts to put the Whitney machine in a hole will be shown no mercy.\"\r\nThe morning papers announced that Whitney had picked up the gantlet\r\nGovernor Wolcott had thrown at his feet, and--all roads led up Beacon\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nIt was a quick, sharp set-to. Every man was lined up with a jerk, and\r\nwhen the line was tallied up and tallied down and Towle had consented to\r\nthe last raise in price of votes and given away to the final squeeze,\r\nthe word went up and down the ranks that the Whitney bill would, on the\r\napproaching last day of the session, go flying through both Houses over\r\nthe governor's veto with a vote or two to spare. Again the prices of the\r\ntwo stocks shot upward.\r\n\r\nThen, sharp and quick as a bolt of lightning, Fate, who apparently had\r\nbeen camped on the trail of Bay State Gas and Addicks from the first,\r\nlet fly another of her quiver's contents. On the morning of the closing\r\nday of the session (the one selected for the Whitney coup), there\r\nslipped in and out amongst the Whitney legislative ranks a man with a\r\nstory. As each legislator listened, his brow knitted and he nodded\r\nassent. The story was a simple one: In one of Whitney's former\r\ncampaigns, desperate like this one, on payment-day Towle had gone back\r\non his promises and forced the acceptance of a fifty-cents-on-the-dollar\r\nsettlement; and, so the story now went, he, Towle, had put the saved\r\nfifty cents, a matter altogether of some $75,000, in his own pocket.\r\nProbably he was now going to repeat the operation on an even larger\r\nscale. In an hour there came to Young's Hotel a trusty messenger who\r\ndelivered to Towle himself the ultimatum of the Great and General Court\r\nof the dear old Commonwealth: \"Money in advance or no bill!\"\r\n\r\nConsternation reigned. The army was quickly recalled to head-quarters,\r\nand despatched back to the State House to put through every manoeuvre\r\nknown to the two veterans--but to no purpose. The Great and General\r\nCourt stood its ground, openly defied the army and hurled back into\r\nTowle's teeth all his frantic threats. It was the last day, and the\r\nGreat and General Court was intrenched inside the protecting walls of\r\nthe State House, and it knew that before it could be compelled to come\r\nforth to face Towle he must come to a decision. A terrible dilemma,\r\nsurely, for the amounts promised had run up to such an enormous\r\naggregate that it was impossible to pay all in so short a time, even if\r\nsuch had been Whitney and Towle's intention. Yet to pay one or a few of\r\nthe dangerous malcontents meant to pay every one; the gang had firmly\r\nbanded themselves together.\r\n\r\nThis was the real moment of panic. Even Whitney and Towle were at their\r\nwits' end. Finally, in desperation, and as a last resort, Whitney rushed\r\nto the governor, threw up his hands, and asked for mercy. \"What would\r\nthe governor sign?\"\r\n\r\nMassachusetts' able and fearless Governor Wolcott, who seemed to have\r\nbeen expecting some such outcome of the battle, gave his answer clear as\r\nan anvil-blow:\r\n\r\n\"You have told the people your company would give them cheap gas. Bind\r\nyourself to do it by amending the charter so that the highest price your\r\ngas can be sold at will be sixty cents. Then I will sign.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to do.[10] At the last minute the amendment was\r\ninserted. The governor's representative gave the word that it was\r\nsatisfactory, and it passed.\r\n\r\nI was in my office taking care of the market. Of the stampede I knew\r\nnothing. Suddenly came the word: \"The Whitney bill has passed on the\r\ngovernor's recommendation.\" Both stocks started to jump; then a halt,\r\nthen--I didn't try to stop the decline, for I saw something terrible had\r\nhappened. In a few minutes the news was on the Street: \"The charter was\r\nnot worth the parchment upon which it was engrossed.\"\r\n\r\nThe biter had been fatally bitten.\r\n\r\nThe market closed with the tape and ticker fiercely, exultingly shouting\r\n\"Ruin!\" with each tick and slip: and that night Whitney's head-quarters\r\nwas little better than a mob. Frantic men demanded money, money due to\r\nthem for votes, money they had promised for margins to the brokers\r\nbefore the Stock Exchange opened the next day, and swearing desperate\r\nconsequences to Whitney and Towle regardless of the effect upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning there came to my office two wild-eyed, desperate\r\ncreatures, Towle and Mr. Patch.\r\n\r\nI had spent the night going over my accounts and those of which I had\r\ncharge, and in addition to a quick, real loss of over a million dollars,\r\nI realized that the immediate future was so hung with dark clouds that I\r\ndared not anticipate what the coming day might mean to me and mine; but\r\nwhen I looked upon the big, powerful man, who had always seemed in any\r\nlight in which I had heretofore beheld him to fear neither man nor\r\nGod--when I looked and saw his plight I pitied him deeply, sincerely. He\r\ncarried a large travelling-bag, and Mr. Patch two others.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, for God's sake, don't do what they are all doing--don't upbraid\r\nme! I've got to get out into the world and be dead to all I\r\nknow--family, friends, every one. If I stay, it's State's prison or\r\nworse, and Whitney says I must go. I've got all the papers together and\r\nWhitney has given me what cash he had on hand, and this check of\r\n$10,000. Do me one last favor, get me gold for it. I know I have no\r\nright to ask any favors of you, but think if you were in my place. I\r\nhave a wife and children, and--\" and the great, strong man wept like a\r\nchild.[11]\r\n\r\nI called my secretary, and in a short time George Towle with the $10,000\r\nin gold and the bags of \"evidence\" faded out of my life and into the\r\ngray mist of eternity.\r\n\r\nA few days after, a vessel dropped anchor off the island of Jamaica;\r\nGeorge Towle's body was carried ashore and buried, and Mr. Patch was\r\nescorted back to the ship. A few days later, with weights of lead to\r\ncarry it to its last resting-place at the ocean's bottom, the latter's\r\ndead body was dropped over the vessel's side. And somewhere floating the\r\nhigh seas are a venturesome sailor-captain and a crew, who when in their\r\ncups tell, 'tis said, strange tales of bags of gold and mysterious\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nAs for the members of the Great and Good Court of the old Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts for the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and\r\nninety-six, they received, none of them could tell from where, their\r\npromised vote-money in the form of a yarn that the \"stuff\" belonging to\r\nthem had been delivered to George Towle, but that Towle had decamped\r\nwith it to foreign shores, where he was living in luxury with Mr. Patch.\r\n\r\n'Tis writ that some crimes are so black and foul that they will not\r\ndown, and when I read over what is written here, I wonder if there will\r\nnot some day be another chapter of \"Frenzied Finance\" written by another\r\npen than mine.\r\n\r\nI sent two police officials to the island of Jamaica, and had the\r\ncontents of the coffin marked \"George H. Towle\" photographed. I could\r\nnot photograph the contents of the ocean's depths.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] A stock operator's one reliable source of information is his ticker and\r\ntape. For the benefit of those of my readers who are unacquainted with the\r\nparaphernalia by which stock-markets and financial operations are\r\nconducted, I would say that the ticker is a small printing machine through\r\nwhich passes an endless paper tape. The machine is run by telegraph wires,\r\nand it prints upon the tape letters and figures which are abbreviations of\r\nthe names and prices of all the stocks and commodities dealt in on the\r\nstock-exchanges and boards of trade throughout the world. The instant\r\nanything of moment happens anywhere, it is reflected by a rise or fall in\r\nthe price of securities or commodities such as wheat, corn, pork, cotton,\r\netc., that are dealt in in the different stock-exchanges or boards of\r\ntrade. As soon as a share of stock or bushel of wheat is sold by one\r\noperator to another on the floors of the different exchanges, its price is\r\nwithin a second printed on the tapes in the different offices. Therefore\r\nwhat the ticker \"ticks\" out onto the tape is instantly read by operators\r\nthroughout the world, and as \"the tape never lies,\" operators turn to it\r\nfor their real information. When the ticker begins to increase its clatter\r\nand the tape to travel fast, an operator will tell you its activity means\r\nsomething unusual is happening. The ticker begins to talk at ten o'clock\r\neach week-day morning and finishes at 3 P.M., with the exception of\r\nSaturday, when the hour is 12 noon. These are the hours that the\r\nstock-exchanges are in session.\r\n\r\n[10] The charter as originally passed had gone through by a fair majority,\r\nbut to pass it over the governor's veto was another matter. That required a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of both houses, and in the brief time at the disposal\r\nof the conspirators the securing of the additional votes was wellnigh\r\nimpossible. From the necessities of the case such votes must cost much more\r\nthan those of the original supporters of the bill, for it may be taken for\r\ngranted that most of the members of the minority had already withstood such\r\ntemptations as the Whitney faction had cared to offer. It was therefore a\r\ncase of bringing into camp the most honorable and the most expensive\r\nmembers of the legislature, and without opportunity for strategy or\r\nmanipulation. The sole recourse was rank, flat bribery, and that in full\r\nview of a mutinous following ready at the suggestion of the slightest\r\nfavoritism to the new men to become actively hostile. The task was\r\naltogether too fraught with peril, to be undertaken. When they realized how\r\nthreatening the situation really was, Whitney and Towle decided to make\r\nterms with the governor. The charter once obtained, they calculated that\r\nthe obnoxious clause might be amended out of it at a subsequent session (as\r\na matter of fact this charter, with its 60-cent clause, was afterward made\r\nthe nucleus of the present Massachusetts Gas companies which has just been\r\nfloated on a basis of $53,000,000 capital). Besides, the state of feeling\r\nof the legislators and conditions in the stock-market had both to be taken\r\ninto consideration. It was not the fault of the legislators who had voted\r\nfor the charter that the governor had vetoed it, for they had been given to\r\nunderstand by Mr. Whitney that he would not oppose it. They had delivered\r\ntheir goods, and now, if the governor's sanction could be had under any\r\nsort of a compromise, they would certainly hold Towle and Whitney\r\nresponsible for failure to make whatever arrangements were necessary.\r\n\r\n[11] Towle told me, as he waited impatiently in my office for the gold,\r\nthat in addition to the great losses the drop in price of the two stocks\r\nhad inflicted on himself and his associates, there were losses on stocks\r\nheld by legislators, who had plunged on assurances that the charter would\r\ngo through, and that the amounts he would be called on to pay, if he\r\nremained, were far greater than could possibly be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPLUNDERED OF THE PLUNDER\r\n\r\n\r\nSo extraordinary a happening as the disappearance of George H. Towle and\r\nMr. Patch, you think, should have furnished a national sensation. And\r\nthis is the first you have ever heard of it. Bear in mind that here for\r\nthe first time the facts of this case are set forth in their proper\r\nrelation to one another, and without the fear or favor that has hitherto\r\nprevented them from being understood.\r\n\r\nIn Boston after the adjournment of the Legislature, however bitter the\r\nfeeling of the men who had sold themselves, and those others who had\r\nlost their all in the crash of stock values that had followed Whitney's\r\ndefeat, their own complicity enforced silence and prevented outcry. It\r\nwas given out that George H. Towle and Mr. Patch, tired by their labors,\r\nhad gone to the country for a brief sojourn. On their return there would\r\nbe a settlement. And with these assurances, both legislators and\r\nlieutenants had, perforce, to be satisfied. Gradually, betrayers and\r\nbetrayed drifted back to their own homes and their erstwhile avocations,\r\nand when the strange story of the disappearance and death of the chief\r\nactors in the Whitney drama came from over the seas, it fell on the\r\nheedless ears of men who had written off a loss and desired to forget\r\nthe experience. A conspiracy of silence is easily organized among\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\nI myself was the greatest sufferer by the disaster. Banking on Whitney's\r\nassurance of success I had loaded up heavily with Bay State on my own\r\naccount; and my customers pinning their faith to my predictions of a\r\nrise, had also bought heavily both of the gas stock and Dominion Coal.\r\nIn my attempt to support the market when the first decline occurred, I\r\nhad further increased my holdings, and, at the final break, thousands\r\nof shares purchased for my clients were left on my hands. So my loss was\r\nvery large, many times larger than Whitney's. Like the others, I said\r\nnothing, crediting the expense to education, while Whitney silently\r\ntucked his emasculated charter into a crypt already furnished with other\r\ncorporation derelicts, to await some fair opportunity of legislative or\r\nother resuscitation; for the instrument, shorn though it had been of its\r\nimmediate availability, was by no means without real value. Probably in\r\nview of prospective contingencies, perhaps with a sense of what his\r\nerror had cost me, he said to me: \"Lawson, the Pipe Line charter is\r\nworthless now, but if at any time in the future it becomes valuable, you\r\nor your company shall have half of it.\"\r\n\r\nIf Henry M. Whitney had kept that promise, what a world of disaster and\r\nbitterness might have been averted. Generated in corruption, perhaps it\r\nis not strange that this charter has since been so fertile a breeder of\r\ndissension and ruin among all who have attempted to handle it. It may be\r\naccepted as an axiom of finance that double-dealing is as dangerous to\r\nthe dealer as to his victim. The fierce conflicts that at intervals\r\nburst out in the financial world and like a cyclone spread dishonor and\r\ndestruction broadcast, invariably are caused by some one man's\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nTo return to my story. To all appearances, the gas war was over. We bore\r\nthe palm of victory, but looming up before us was the task of getting\r\ntogether the six millions which Rogers must have by November 1st. That\r\npaid, the companies became permanently ours. It was a period of\r\nunremitting effort, but the prospects of success were excellent. Addicks\r\nhad got ready a new lot of Bay State stock, and I had prepared the\r\npublic to take it. With the proceeds of this stock and the securities\r\nwhich Rogers would turn over to us, we should have money enough to meet\r\nour engagement, always provided no slip-up occurred. Since the May 1st\r\nsettlement our relations with Rogers had been satisfactory--I should\r\nsay, _my_ relations--for he persistently kept Addicks and his crowd at a\r\ndistance, refusing to have anything to do with them. But it's hard to\r\nkeep a big pot boiling in the open without some intruder smelling the\r\nsavor of your soup and sneaking up for a mouthful. Though secrecy had\r\nbeen solicitously preserved regarding the details of our bargain with\r\nthe \"Standard Oil\" magnates, certain of the camp-followers of \"Frenzied\r\nFinance\" had nosed out the facts, and at the very moment when our\r\nposition and prospects seemed most secure a plot was being laid, which,\r\nas after-events will show, came close to bringing about the destruction\r\nwe had thus far managed to escape.\r\n\r\nAs the time of settlement drew near, it became necessary for me to have\r\nfrequent conferences with Addicks and his directors, and we opened\r\nhead-quarters at the Hoffman House in New York. It was my habit to come\r\nover for a short time every week, when we got together, reported\r\nprogress, and discussed future moves. It was at one of these gatherings,\r\non Friday, October 16th, that we had intimation of our peril. I had come\r\ndown on the midnight train from Boston and was brimming over with\r\npleasant news and agreeable anticipations. The day and all other things\r\nseemed good to me. The air was crisp and the morning sun gleamed\r\nbrightly on the red and yellow autumn tints of the trees in Madison\r\nSquare. For a moment I stood on the corner beside the naval monument\r\nwatching the down-townward procession of cabs and coupés in which the\r\nspider aristocracy of finance makes its way to its webs in Wall Street\r\nand lower Broadway. In the parlor of Addicks' suite at the Hoffman the\r\ndirectors were gathered when I entered, and with them was Parker\r\nChandler, the Bay State's general counsel. We got down to business at\r\nonce. I told them how well our affairs were moving in Boston and\r\nlistened to their tidings of progress elsewhere. We were all in the\r\nmerry mood of success. The past was nothing but a bad dream; our\r\nthoughts were on the rich moments beyond November 1st when we should\r\nhandle and know the real currency of our victory.\r\n\r\nThe telephone bell rang. Some one wanted Addicks quick.\r\n\r\nAddicks stepped to the instrument. We all heard him say: \"Hello.\"\r\nThen--\"Is that you, Fred?\" (Fred Keller was his personal secretary.)\r\nThen--\"Yes, I hear you plainly. Repeat it.\" Then--a minute's wait while\r\nwe listened. Then--\"When will they get up there?\" Then--\"Send every one\r\nhome, lock up and go over to the house, and call me on my wire.\" All\r\nthis in his ordinary, well-attuned, even voice, without the emphasis of\r\na word to show that the subject was a hair more important than any of\r\nthe hundred and one ordinary messages which went to make up a large part\r\nof his daily life. The talk was so commonplace that we were none of us\r\ninterested enough to even stop our chatter.\r\n\r\nAddicks stepped from the telephone and in a \"bring-me-a-finger-bowl\"\r\ntone of voice said: \"Tom, come into the other room for a minute; I want\r\na word with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed ahead of me through a small parlor into his bedroom. I\r\nfollowed. He went straight to the bureau, took something from a drawer,\r\nslipped it into his pocket, turned and dropped upon a lounge. But a\r\nminute had elapsed since he had gone to the telephone. Could this gray\r\nghost be the same man who a short time ago had been smiling so\r\ncontentedly at Parker Chandler's last story? His face was the color of a\r\nmouldy lead pipe and seared with strange lines and seams. The eyes that\r\nmet mine were dim and glazed, lustreless and dead as the eyes of a fish\r\ndragged from watery depths.\r\n\r\nCourage is not character; it is temperamental. There is an impression\r\nthat the man truly brave is he who can face sudden, unexpected\r\nmisfortune or calamity without a tremor or a flicker to suggest his\r\nhurt. That is but a single phase and indicative of physical rather than\r\nmoral qualities; or, perhaps, merely the callousness born of long\r\nexposure to danger. One of the bravest men I've ever known stood\r\nwatching the ticker one day during a downward run. Suddenly I heard \"My\r\nGod, I'm ruined!\" and he fell in a faint on the floor. And a certain\r\nbank officer, whom I knew to be an arrant coward when arrested for\r\nstealing a million, smiled at the policeman who had tapped his shoulder\r\nand asked him for a light for his cigarette. Addicks had not turned a\r\nhair as he hung up the telephone receiver, and here he was cowering in a\r\nmortal funk, abjectly hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, the game's up,\" he said in a trembling voice. \"That was Fred.\r\nHe says Dwight Braman has had himself appointed receiver of Bay State;\r\nthat he raided the Wilmington office immediately after he was appointed,\r\nbroke open desks, and took all the papers he could find, and that in an\r\nhour or so he will be in Philadelphia and in possession of all my books\r\nand papers. He has a court order for the bank accounts and the right to\r\ntake charge of our funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a startler,\" I said; \"what are we going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The trap is perfect, and I'm in it. They've caught me with every bar\r\ndown. Before, when they attempted to get a receivership, things were\r\nready for them--books and papers packed for Europe and cash in charge of\r\nan unserved officer prepared at the first word to start for Canada. But\r\nnow, a few days before election, when if I don't throw a lot of money\r\ninto Delaware for my followers, they'll turn on me like wolves--they've\r\ncaught me napping. It's a plot, sure--a receiver in possession,\r\nparticularly Braman, and appointed in a way that shows deliberate\r\ncalculation, proves it was done by some one who knows our situation to a\r\n'T.' It means ruin for me and the company. You know I won't have a\r\nfriend left on earth, and enemies now will rise up like snakes before a\r\nprairie fire.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a stiff, tough turn, yet I was watching the man rather out\r\nof curiosity to note how he could take a reverse than out of sympathy. I\r\ndon't believe there was another man on earth who, similarly placed,\r\nwould not have aroused my pity; but Addicks--no man or woman has pity\r\nfor Addicks.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I repeated, \"what are we going to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply for a moment. I continued to look at him. The eyes\r\nhaunted me. I noted that the lines round the lids had deepened into\r\nfurrows. He half raised himself from the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"I've said they would never get me, and they won't.\" Instinctively his\r\nhand sought the pocket into which he had dropped what he had taken from\r\nthe dresser's drawer. Then I knew. The yellow streak showed plain at\r\nlast. I had guessed from the start it was there.\r\n\r\nThe stock manipulator in common with the successful general must have\r\nthe capacity to deal with the unexpected. The faculty to see a situation\r\nwhole must be his, to focus instantly the lay of the land, the enemy's\r\nplans and strength, his own resources, the strategic possibilities of\r\nhis position; and instantly, if necessity demands it, he must be ready\r\nwith a new plan of campaign fitted to the first emergency. The more\r\nrapidly his mind works the safer are the interests he is guarding. But\r\nif he has not this capacity, he can never be a market manipulator.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I could not but pause to admire the devilish ingenuity of\r\nthe trap that had been sprung on us. The state of affairs that Addicks\r\nrevealed was about the worst imaginable. I had been on this particular\r\nwar-path so long that my mind instantly grasped the possibilities of\r\ndestruction that lay in this new attack. I saw November 1st--no money to\r\npay Rogers; everything forfeited; Addicks in a nauseating scandal; and\r\nall those friends of mine who had put their funds into Bay State because\r\nof their confidence in my ability to win out slaughtered. No, it should\r\nnot be if I could prevent it. Other storms we had met and weathered, why\r\nnot this? Even if it were a tornado, we would \"ride her out.\" Perhaps we\r\nshould not be afloat when the rollers subsided, but at least we should\r\nbe at rest--on the bottom. I turned to Addicks, who, heaped up on his\r\nlounge, was staring into vacancy.\r\n\r\n\"Brace up, Addicks,\" I said. \"We are not knocked out yet. At least let\r\nus find out what has struck us.\"\r\n\r\nI was some moments in arousing him from his condition of despair, but\r\nfinally he pulled himself together, and piece by piece we went over\r\nthe situation. I had to agree with him that he was in an\r\nend-to-end-center-pull trap. The cunning machinery he had set up to\r\nmeet just such an emergency, now that it was in hostile hands, was\r\nrather a source of danger than of safety. There was but one way out of\r\nthe complication--we must undo this receivership and release our\r\nproperties and funds before November 1st. Addicks, when he got his\r\nthinking loom running, declared the receivership was all a \"Standard\r\nOil\" plot to ruin him. I felt sure it was an independent operation,\r\nbut there was no time for controversy.\r\n\r\nThe telephone bell rang again. It was Fred Keller, talking from Addicks'\r\nhouse. We soon had all the details of the raid. This is what had\r\nhappened. Dwight Braman, a former Boston broker, now a New York\r\ncapitalist and promoter, had suddenly appeared in Wilmington, Del.,\r\naccompanied by Roger Foster, a New York attorney representing Wm.\r\nBuchanan, one of the original holders of Bay State Gas income bonds. He\r\nheld $100,000. They had gone before Judge Wales, and pleading that the\r\ninterest on the bonds was in default and that Addicks was dissipating\r\nthe assets of the company, had succeeded in inducing the judge to\r\nappoint Braman receiver. The whole performance was put through with such\r\nmarvellous rapidity that not one of Addicks' innumerable henchmen had\r\nhad a hint of it, and so no warning could be given in any direction.\r\nBraman, an adept in corporation try-outs, lost not a moment, for the\r\ninstant his receivership appointment was signed he pounced down on the\r\nDelaware offices of the Bay State and seized everything they contained.\r\nHe was waiting there for the first train to Philadelphia for the purpose\r\nof capturing the head offices of our corporation, which were located\r\nthere, adjoining Addicks' private offices.\r\n\r\nIt was the moment for rapid action. We had an hour before Braman and\r\nFoster could reach Philadelphia, and in finance in that time continents'\r\nhave been submerged and oceans pumped dry. Addicks instructed Fred\r\nKeller to rush the books of the company into a trunk, together with all\r\nthe private papers in Addicks' safe, and to come at once to New York,\r\nwhere he would be beyond the jurisdiction of the Delaware court. We\r\nreturned to the large parlor and hastily explained to the waiting\r\ndirectors what had occurred. Addicks instructed the Bay State secretary,\r\nwho was present, to connect with the trunk upon its arrival and\r\ndisappear. In the meantime the company's counsel advised that Addicks\r\nand the other directors barricade themselves in their rooms at the\r\nHoffman to frustrate any attempt to get legal service on them, for we\r\nwell knew that Braman and Foster, as soon as they realized they were\r\nbalked in Philadelphia, would go to the New York courts for additional\r\npowers--which afterward they did.\r\n\r\nThis line of defence having been fully organized I hurried down town to\r\n26 Broadway. I felt certain that Mr. Rogers had nothing to do with the\r\nBraman-Foster affair, but to satisfy Addicks and make assurance doubly\r\nsure I determined to see him. After being with him for five minutes I\r\nknew I had not been deceived. Rogers agreed with me that the situation\r\nlooked as though it had been made for his interest, for it threatened to\r\nleave us absolutely at his mercy with nothing to prevent his checkmating\r\nAddicks at his own game. As I pointed out to him, however, there were\r\ndisadvantages in the position which he must take into consideration. His\r\nacceptance of the opportunity would work such losses to the public and\r\nto my friends that though the responsibility might be laid to Braman and\r\nFoster, I would fight so viciously that no one would be spared. Besides,\r\nbetween the Addicks scandal and that other which we agreed must\r\nunquestionably lurk in the hasty appointment of the receiver, the whole\r\naffair must eventually be ventilated in court. It is always hard for Mr.\r\nRogers to forego an advantage, but by this time he was tired of the\r\nwrangle and wanted peace, and, moreover, he did not relish the thought\r\nof court proceedings, so he admitted that my reasoning was good, and\r\npromised to do anything in his power to assist us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTWO GENTLEMEN OF FRENZIED FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemy did not leave us long in suspense. Next day Braman and Foster\r\narrived in New York, bursting with a noble wrath at the failure of their\r\ncoup in Philadelphia. An outrage had been worked upon them, upon the\r\npublic, upon the majesty of the law. To hear their ravings one might\r\nhave supposed them the evangelists of Justice righteously denouncing a\r\ndesecration of the sacred altar; or, that we had deprived them of an\r\ninalienable right they had possessed to our property. It would have been\r\nhumorous if the conditions had been less tragic.\r\n\r\nNo defender of property right is so vociferous as the financier who,\r\nhaving appropriated his neighbor's goods, argues that possession\r\nconstitutes legal ownership. On a country road I once almost rode over\r\ntwo hoboes, who were so busy wrangling with one another that they had\r\nnot heard my approach. I gathered that one of them, having filched a\r\ncollection of laundry from a farmer's backyard, had placed it in charge\r\nof his mate while he went off for a second helping, and had returned\r\njust in time to stop the latter from decamping with the swag. The talk\r\nthe original purloiner was giving his ungrateful assistant was one of\r\nthe best expositions of virtue and honesty I've ever listened to.\r\n\r\nWe met the following Monday and in reply to my request that we talk\r\nthings over, Foster delivered himself of an exalted exposition of the\r\nrights of deluded stockholders, the majesty of the law, and the stern\r\nduties of Mr. Braman, who, for the time being, had departed his private\r\nself and, until further notice, existed only as a rigid arm of the\r\ncourt. Just as I had arrived at the conclusion that I had got into the\r\nwrong shop, Braman took up the lecture by informing me of things I\r\nalready had made myself familiar with, to wit, how he had at different\r\ntimes occupied similar rôles in other corporations' affairs and how\r\nrelentlessly he had exposed mismanagement and peculation. I suggested to\r\nhim that in most such cases the receiverships seemed to have been\r\ndismissed in favor of the former managers. He waved his hands and\r\nreplied that in this particular case there was absolutely no chance of\r\ncontrol being returned to Addicks, who had outrageously abused his\r\ntrust; \"although, of course (this as a sort of second thought) you know,\r\nMr. Lawson, if Mr. Foster on behalf of his client should receive the\r\namount of his claim and the proper fee, from whatever source, I should\r\nbe powerless to prevent the dismissal of the receiver.\"\r\n\r\nBraman and Foster were a delightful combination. As the talented Chimmie\r\nFadden would say: \"Dey knew dere biz from de bar to de till an' from de\r\ntill by de way of de cash register to de wine-cellar, so's dey could do\r\nde circuit wid dere lamps blinked and dere hands tied.\" With their\r\ncorporation mix-up records I was familiar, and after a few minutes' talk\r\nrealized that it would be impossible to do anything with them until they\r\nhad kicked up against one or two of the bricks Addicks was now with\r\nrenewed energy preparing to cast into their pathway. I left with an\r\nagreement to see them the following day, and a parting reminder that all\r\nnatural history showed that unpicked ripe plums were in great danger of\r\nbeing blown from the tree with every passing breeze.\r\n\r\nI hurried back to Addicks. \"It's the old game,\" said I; \"they are on the\r\nbox and have the lines, and know just how badly we need our coach, and\r\nit's only a case of how much 'inducement' we can stand.\"\r\n\r\nI left him and went down to 26 Broadway. I had not wasted time, but they\r\nhad been there ahead of me.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"this time Addicks is up against a real\r\ncondition, and phenomenal work will have to be done or his race is run.\r\nBraman and Foster have been here and made a strong bid for a partnership\r\nwith me, but I did as agreed and sent them away with a cold 'I'm in no\r\nway interested.'\"\r\n\r\nFoster and Braman secured an order from the New York courts to take\r\npossession of all property, money, papers, and books claimed by the\r\ncompany, and formally laid siege to Addicks' quarters in the Hoffman.\r\nThere was considerable excitement for the guests and the newspapers.\r\nDoors were battered down, but the astute and slippery Addicks led them a\r\nmerry chase until they finally caught him hiding in a freight elevator\r\nwhich he was using for a private staircase, only to find he had no\r\nbooks, papers, or money.\r\n\r\nThe week that ensued was full of trouble and incident for all concerned.\r\nAddicks led an expedition to Wilmington in an effort to get the court to\r\ncall off the receivership, but had his labor and the expense of his\r\nlawyers for his pains. Braman and Foster dragged us through a weary\r\nround of special hearings and demands of various kinds in the different\r\ncourts, but by Tuesday night of the second week their ardor had cooled\r\nconsiderably and they were as puzzled how to let go of the bull they had\r\ncaptured as we were to find a way to make them do so.\r\n\r\nBright and early Wednesday morning Braman called on me, and when he\r\nthrew his coat and hat into a chair he must have dropped his\r\nreceivership cloak too, for after he had carefully closed the door and\r\nmade sure we were without witness he said:\r\n\r\n\"If there's any business to be done in this matter it must be done\r\nquick.\"\r\n\r\nI admitted no one could possibly appreciate this more than I--but what\r\ncould be done? After bluffing for an hour and exchanging honest views\r\nfor fifteen minutes we agreed that the situation stood thus:\r\n\r\nIf nothing were done before the coming Sunday, the 1st, the receivership\r\nwould be permanent; the stock, which had fallen to $3 per share, would\r\nremain at that figure or go lower; my friends, the public, and myself\r\nwould be tremendous losers; all the past of Bay State, the doings of\r\nAddicks and Rogers, and the appointment of the receiver would come in\r\nfor thorough investigation; an awful scandal would be aired in public;\r\nevery one would be covered more or less with mud; and no one could\r\npossibly be the gainer but \"Standard Oil,\" for Braman agreed with me\r\nthat the deal we had made with Rogers would probably stand in the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if an arrangement could be arrived at by which we\r\ncould have the receivership discharged, the company returned to its\r\nofficers, or our equities preserved, all would be gainers by the move,\r\nfor it would be proof positive that whatever the obstacles, we could\r\novercome them, and the stock would go flying upward again.\r\n\r\nAfter we had set out all the advantages, disadvantages, and\r\npossibilities of the situation, I bluntly plumped Braman with that\r\ninevitable question of all such \"sit-downs\": \"What's the price?\" And\r\nBraman as plumply and bluntly answered: \"Buchanan, Foster's client, must\r\nhave the face of his bonds and interest, $150,000, and we must have at\r\nleast $150,000 for our trouble and expense.\"\r\n\r\nMy long experience in corporation affairs, and my intimate knowledge of\r\nthe practices which the \"System\" with its votaries has made habitual was\r\nsuch that I was proof against shock from anything that could possibly\r\nturn up in even extraordinary financial deals, but I was just a bit\r\nstaggered by the business-like way Braman demanded for himself and\r\nFoster $150,000 and the coolness with which he further explained that\r\nthey must divide their share with certain influential persons without\r\nwhose hearty cooperation the tangling-up which had been so cleverly\r\naccomplished would have been impossible. He made no bones of showing me\r\nthat once \"we gave up\" it would only be a matter of the number of\r\nminutes required to get details fixed before everything would be as it\r\nwas before he had interfered. I dwelt upon the possibilities of the\r\njudge not following orders to the letter and the minute, but he only\r\nsmiled and answered: \"Leave all that to us; if we don't make good as\r\nagreed, we get no pay.\" He was fully alive to the dangers of the game,\r\nand he impressed upon me he would take nobody's word for anything. With\r\nhim and Foster nothing but money talked, and it must not be of the\r\nmarked-bill kind either, meaning he would not take anything which could\r\nbe tied up by injunctions and lawsuits after the receiver had been\r\ndismissed. However, he would play fair. He would not ask us to pay on\r\nanything but the actual delivery of the goods. He also frankly told me\r\nthat he had named the very low figure, $150,000, because he expected to\r\ninvest what he received in Bay State Gas stock at $3 and, upon its\r\njumping to $10 or $20, to make half a million.\r\n\r\nBut this is outrageous, you say. You call the performance I have\r\ndescribed by hard names! Surely our courts are not also the creatures of\r\n\"frenzied finance\"? you ask. I warn my readers that this narrative is no\r\nmore than a record of events occurring within my own knowledge, and that\r\ndark and vicious as the pictures seem they are photographs of actual\r\nhappenings. Nor should the public conclude that the dishonor and\r\ndishonesty revealed in connection with Bay State Gas are exceptional. On\r\nthe contrary, such doings are the rule in the affairs of great financial\r\ncorporations. Into the rigging and launching of almost every big\r\nfinancial operation in the United States during the last twenty years,\r\ndouble-dealing, sharp practice, and jobbery have entered; and, what is\r\nmore, the men interested have participated in and profited thereby. To\r\ncorrect a popular fallacy I want to say that I am not referring here\r\nsimply to moral derelictions but to actual legal crimes. If the details\r\nof the great reorganization and trustification deals put through since\r\n1885 could be laid bare, eight out of ten of our most successful\r\nstock-jobbing financiers would be in a fair way to get into State or\r\nfederal prisons. They do such things better in England. During the past\r\nten years three \"frenzied financiers\" have practised their legerdemain\r\nin London--Ernest Hooley, Barney Barnato, and Whitaker Wright. The first\r\nis bankrupt and discredited; Barney Barnato jumped into the ocean at the\r\nheight of his career, and Whitaker Wright, after numerous attempts to\r\nescape, was hauled up before an English judge and jury, promptly\r\nconvicted and sentenced, and committed suicide by poison before leaving\r\nthe court-room. I will agree at any time to set down from memory the\r\nnames of a score of eminent American financiers, at this writing in full\r\nenjoyment of the envy and respect of their countrymen and the luxury\r\npurchased by their many millions, whose crimes, moral and legal,\r\ncommitted in the accumulation of these millions, would, if fully\r\nexposed, make the performances of Wright and Barnato seem like petty\r\nlarceny in comparison.[12] But freedom and equality, as guaranteed us by\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, have recently been capitalized, and\r\n\"freedom\" now means immunity from legal interference for financiers,\r\nwhile the latest acceptance of \"equality\" is that all victims of special\r\nprivilege are treated alike by those who control and exercise such\r\nprivilege. If the judges and the public prosecutors of these United\r\nStates were equal to the sworn duties of their sacred offices, this\r\n\"freedom\" would have been confined long ago, and throughout this broad\r\nland there would be jails full of \"frenzied financiers\" who had imagined\r\nthemselves licensed to rob the public.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Bay State Gas: \"Braman,\" I said, \"we see the situation\r\nthrough the same glasses, but before deciding as to prices let us see\r\nwhere the coin required is to come from. Until the receivership is\r\ndismissed not a cent can come from the Bay State treasury, so that\r\neliminates Addicks. I, personally, am in such shape because of this same\r\nreceivership that I can do nothing. So, as usual, it comes down to the\r\nman with unlimited money--Rogers. The question is, how to get Rogers to\r\nadvance so large a sum in such a ticklish business? He does not want to\r\nget mixed up in a matter in which any one man's treachery might mean\r\nState's prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's word ought to be good,\" he commented.\r\n\r\n\"Only two men's words would be of any avail,\" I interrupted--\"yours and\r\nAddicks', and you have just made it clear that in this case neither\r\nwould be worth the breath expended in pledging it.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Since the above was published the American people have become aroused,\r\nand as this book is going to press, scores of the greatest financiers in\r\nAmerica are having under oath confessions squeezed from them in a\r\nlife-insurance investigation conducted by the State of New\r\nYork--confessions which reveal such a condition of perjury, bribery, and\r\nhabitual sequestration of funds, as to make my statement seem mild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nBUYING A BUNCH OF STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Braman and went down to Mr. Rogers. After a careful canvas of the\r\nsituation it was settled that the only way out was for Rogers to furnish\r\nthe money to release the receivership, in consideration of which\r\naccommodation Addicks should forfeit the old Boston companies to him\r\nthrough Bay State's failure to comply with the terms of the May contract\r\nwhich matured the following Monday. Rogers would administer these\r\ncompanies in trust, applying their earnings to the liquidation of the\r\nbonds, and after these latter had been paid off, would turn them back to\r\nthe Bay State Company for the benefit of its stock; or he would release\r\nthe companies to us whenever we could raise the money to redeem them.\r\nThus Rogers would make sure of the amount of his original investment,\r\nthe million dollars profit the May 1st deal permitted him, while I\r\nshould have secured for my friends and the public the amount of their\r\ninvestment in the property and a good profit for the stockholders to\r\nboot. To secure Addicks' consent to this arrangement would be the\r\ndifficulty; but there was one consideration that would probably induce\r\nhim to give way--his terrible plight in case the receivership became\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this point, the next problem was how to get the money.\r\nRogers refused absolutely to be a party to any payment that could be\r\ntraced back to him. He pointed out the sources of hazard; first, through\r\ntreachery on the part of Foster, Braman, or Addicks, he might be accused\r\nof bribing a court officer, the receiver; Addicks might blackmail him by\r\ncharging him with conspiracy, or a conspiracy charge might be brought by\r\nBay State stockholders, and he be held for tremendous damages. He\r\nrefused to put himself into any such trap. I put forward a dozen ways to\r\nmeet the emergency, but he would have none of them. Finally he suggested\r\na method which was certainly perfect of its kind. He began by letting me\r\ninto the secret that the chances of a McKinley victory in the election\r\nthe following week looked pretty bad, and that the latest canvass of the\r\nState showed that unless something radical were done, Bryan would surely\r\nwin. Hanna had called into consultation half a dozen of the biggest\r\nfinanciers in Wall Street, and it was decided to turn at least five of\r\nthe doubtful States. For this purpose a fund of $5,000,000 had been\r\nraised under Rogers' direction,[13] to be turned over to Mark Hanna and\r\nMcKinley's cousin, Osborne, through John Moore, the Wall Street broker,\r\nwho was acting as Rogers' representative in collecting the money. It\r\nwould be legitimate for the National Committee to pay out money to carry\r\nDelaware, and he, Rogers, would arrange it that the coin to satisfy\r\nBraman and Foster should come through this channel. Thus he would be\r\ncompletely protected.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers, looking at me with intense and deadly\r\nseriousness, his voice charged with conviction, \"if Bryan's elected,\r\nthere will be such a panic in this country as the world has never seen,\r\nand with his money ideas and the crazy-headed radicals he will call to\r\nWashington to administer the nation's affairs, business will surely be\r\ndestroyed and the working people will suffer untold misery. You know we\r\nall hate to do what Uncle Mark says is necessary, but it's a case of\r\nsome of us sacrificing something for the country's good. Bryan's\r\nelection would set our country back a century, and I believe it's the\r\nsacred duty of every honest American to do what he can to save his land\r\nfrom such a calamity.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe \"System's\" conscience has its own quaint logic--the logic of\r\nself-interest--and this is how it reasoned: \"The election of Bryan would\r\ndisturb our control of American institutions, therefore American\r\ninstitutions would be destroyed by Bryan's election. On us, the\r\n'System,' devolves the sacred if expensive duty of saving the nation,\r\nand, however abhorrent to our fine moral sense, patriotism compels us to\r\nspend millions in bribing and corrupting the electorate so that virtue,\r\n'Standard Oil,' and J. P. Morgan may continue the good work of caring\r\nfor the public's interests as their own.\"\r\n\r\nAs I listened to Rogers' exordium on the duties of a citizen in an\r\nemergency, I remembered the \"Standard Oil\" code--\"Everything for God\r\n(our God); God (our God) in everything.\" It was so essentially \"Standard\r\nOil,\" this willingness to commit even that greatest wrong, subverting\r\nthe will of the people in the exercise of their highest function--the\r\nelection of a President--but only that good (their good) might come of\r\nit. It was no more than selfish greed tricked out in the noble trappings\r\nof morality, an infamous crime disguised as patriotism. Doubtless, the\r\nexcellent, God-fearing, law-abiding citizens of the doubtful States who\r\nread this and learn how the \"System\" defeated their will at the polls\r\nwill cry, \"Monstrous! Can such things be in America?\" and then will\r\nresume their interrupted occupation of \"letting well enough alone.\"\r\nHowever, this is aside from my story.\r\n\r\nHaving clearly set forth the political situation through which we should\r\nbe saved, Mr. Rogers proceeded to map out my own programme. First, I\r\nmust perfect an alibi for him by going to Foster and Braman, and\r\nimpressing upon them the fact that he was absolutely out of the affair,\r\nand must under no circumstances be brought into it; next, I must\r\nconvince Addicks to the same effect, and in addition tell him that Mr.\r\nRogers had angrily refused to get into the mix-up; I should then hold\r\nmyself in readiness to meet John Moore and Hanna or Osborne as soon as\r\nan appointment could be arranged. That afternoon I got the word and went\r\nto 26 Broadway, and from there Mr. Rogers and I went over to John\r\nMoore's office, slipping in the private door from the rear street.\r\n\r\n\"John,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"I am going to turn this matter over to you and\r\nLawson, and I am to have nothing further to do with it. What you two\r\nagree to will be satisfactory to me, and remember, both of you, every\r\ndollar that is paid is paid by the National Committee, but after it's\r\nall settled, and if there is no slip-up, I will look to Lawson for\r\nwhatever is expended. Is it understood?\"\r\n\r\nWe agreed that it was, and Mr. Rogers left us.\r\n\r\nJohn Moore deserves more than a mere passing mention here, for he was at\r\nthis time a distinguished Wall Street character and one of the ablest\r\npractitioners of finance in the country. During the last fifteen years\r\nof his life, John Moore was party to more confidential financial jobs\r\nand deals than all other contemporaneous financiers, and he handled them\r\nwith great skill and high art. Big, jolly, generous, a royal eater and\r\ndrinker, an associate of the rich, the friend of the poor, a many-times\r\nmillionaire, who a few years before had been logging it on the rivers of\r\nMaine, his native State, John Moore well deserved his \"Street\" name,\r\n\"Prince John.\" His firm, Moore & Schley, transacted an immense brokerage\r\nbusiness, and numbered among its clients great capitalists and bankers\r\nall over the country. Especially were Moore & Schley famed for their\r\ndiscretion, and the highest proof of confidence reposed in the firm was\r\nthe fact that it did the bulk of the stock speculating for what is known\r\nas \"the Washington contingent.\" This is, perhaps, the most peculiar and\r\ndelicate business that comes to \"the Street.\" A big Wall Street house\r\nopens a Washington office and organizes an elaborate system of special\r\nwires, wires from which there can be no possibility of leakage. It is\r\nthen ready for the patronage of members of Congress, United States\r\nSenators and national officials, whose honorable positions make them the\r\ncustodians of national secrets of great commercial value. If, for\r\ninstance, a new law is to be passed which must favorably affect a given\r\nstock, legislators who are on \"the inside\" often buy thousands of shares\r\nin order to reap the profit of the rise in value incidental to its\r\npassage. Or perhaps there is in prospect a law which will interfere with\r\nthe special privilege of some other stock and reduce its price. Those in\r\npossession of advance information \"go short\" of that stock (sell for\r\nfuture delivery) to profit by the drop. There are many other\r\nopportunities the Washington \"insider\" of speculative turn may use to\r\nadvantage. For instance, if a high official of the Government were about\r\nto issue a proclamation against a foreign nation, and should desire\r\nsecretly to make a million or so out of the panic he knew must follow\r\nthe announcement, he would cast about him for a broker who would\r\npreserve this sacred confidence. It would invariably be through the\r\nMoore firm that his secretary or confidential man would do the short\r\nselling. There are also the operations of lobbyists who, to affect\r\nimportant legislation for this great interest or the other, buy or sell\r\nstock for the benefit of legislators whose votes they desire to\r\ninfluence. Extreme caution is demanded in the execution of such orders,\r\nor all hands might by some slip-up find themselves wearing striped\r\nsuits.[15]\r\n\r\nSuch a catastrophe seemed imminent some years ago when the Sugar Trust\r\nwas before the United States Senate for some legislation necessary to\r\nbolster up its monopoly. Its agents had either been less cautious than\r\nusual in disguising the raw bribery they were perpetrating, or this\r\nparticular Senate was too brazen to take the usual precautions to hide\r\nits greed from the world. In any case, so great an outcry was made in\r\nthe press of the country that some sacrifice to the people's wrath was\r\ncalled for--one of those familiar sacrifices which, at intervals of ten\r\nor fifteen years in this republic, our rulers make to the great god\r\nIntegrity. An investigation was organized, and a Senatorial inquisition\r\nhad before it eminent sugar capitalists and many other distinguished\r\ngentlemen who could by no possibility shed light on the transactions,\r\nand then, realizing that a show of earnestness, at least, was demanded,\r\nit was agreed that some member of Moore & Schley's firm must go on the\r\nwitness-stand, and, on refusing to tell which Senators had speculated in\r\nsugar, must be sent to jail. This grandstand play, it was calculated,\r\nand rightly, would so hold the attention of the American people that\r\nwhen the committee concluded its investigation with the usual loud\r\nacclaim of duty well done, its Draconian punishment of the unsubmissive\r\nbroker would act as another ten years' stay against outcry.\r\n\r\nWhen this stratagem was decided on, John Moore announced that he as head\r\nof the firm should be the sacrifice. But the representatives of the\r\n\"System\" and the Senate firmly refused to assign him that rôle, and\r\ninstead, to his grief and anger, nominated for jail the associate member\r\nwho had charge of Moore & Schley's Washington business, whom they\r\ndeclared the logical victim. During the thirty days that his friend and\r\npartner spent behind the bars John Moore's hair whitened more than in\r\nall the years before, and from that time until his death he refused\r\nfirmly to take part in his old line of work, or was ever again his old\r\njovial self.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Over a year after the publication of this statement startled the\r\ncountry, John A. McCall, President of the New York Life Insurance Company,\r\nand George W. Perkins, Vice-President of the same company and partner of J.\r\nPierpont Morgan, were compelled to confess that they had contributed from\r\ntheir policy-holders' deposits, large amounts of money to a fund to defeat\r\nBryan in 1896 and to the Republican campaign funds of the two following\r\npresidential elections, and that they gloried in it. At the same time Jacob\r\nSchiff, director of the Equitable Life and a partner in the great\r\ninternational banking-house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., admitted that funds\r\nbelonging to the policy-holders of the \"Big Three,\" the New York, the\r\nMutual, and the Equitable, were used in a joint fund to influence the\r\nLegislature of every State in the Union.\r\n\r\n[14] President McCall used almost the same language in September, 1905, in\r\njustifying his payment.\r\n\r\n[15] The President was notified some few months ago that the cotton report\r\nwas being juggled by employees of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture in the interest of certain Wall Street speculators who were\r\ngambling in cotton. Investigation proved that it was the practice to\r\nfalsify the report; and certain Government officials and brokers are now\r\nunder indictment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nATHLETICS OF FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEntirely apart from his relationship with Mr. Rogers it was a great help\r\nin this Bay State emergency to have the aid of a man of John Moore's\r\nwealth of vim and wide knowledge of men and affairs. Freely and frankly\r\nI explained our situation to him with its innumerable complications\r\nuntil he had mastered its intricacies. A tough job he pronounced our\r\nproposition, and he was the authority on the subject. After our talk was\r\nended he called in Osborne, who had evidently already been talked to. He\r\nsaid to Osborne:\r\n\r\n\"I've been over Addicks' affairs with Lawson, and there is no question\r\nin my mind and that of other friends of the party that he should have\r\nwhat is necessary to carry Delaware. You had better have the committee\r\nready to put in between $350,000 and $400,000 if we call for it. I will\r\nsee that it is kept down as low as possible.\"\r\n\r\nOsborne then spoke his piece and replied that the committee would do\r\nwhatever was decided best, and asked me to send Addicks around next day\r\nto explain just how he was pushing things in Delaware. All this was\r\nplay-acting for the benefit of Rogers' alibi.\r\n\r\nThe next thing on my programme was to persuade Addicks to relinquish his\r\nhold on the old Boston gas companies, and this was likely to prove my\r\nmost difficult task. I left John Moore, who agreed to hold himself in\r\nreadiness at any hour to consult on and approve such settlement as I\r\ncould arrange, and energetically started in on the Delaware financier.\r\nIt was a trying ordeal. As soon as Addicks saw I had something to work\r\non he began to demur and object. If he could not have things his way, he\r\nwould do nothing. He knew that I had joined a conspiracy to ruin him;\r\nthat I was in league with Rogers, who was in league with Braman and\r\nFoster, and that all were banded together to take all he had away from\r\nhim. In the course of that two hours' wrestle I was tempted several\r\ntimes to throw up the whole affair, and there were some bitter and\r\nsavage word-passages that left both of us heated. I could do nothing\r\nwith him; he must hear from Rogers personally. Finally I got the\r\n\"Standard Oil\" wire, and Rogers talked so plainly and coldly as\r\npartially to sober him, but ended by agreeing to have his counsel talk\r\nthings over with Addicks, which was a distinct concession. A little\r\nlater Mr. Rogers' representative was at the Hoffman and he and Addicks\r\nhad it hot and heavy. After about fifteen minutes of conference they had\r\nwellnigh come to blows. However, the hot exchanges had begun to tell.\r\nAddicks grew saner, but he insisted on seeing Foster and Braman. I\r\nwarned him that he was fast getting our affairs into such shape that no\r\none could patch them up, but to no avail. He must meet his enemies face\r\nto face if only to ram into their teeth that they were scoundrels.\r\nFinally, I got Braman on the telephone and explained that I was doing my\r\nbest to quiet a crazy man, who would consent to nothing until after he\r\nhad seen him and Foster and told them what thieves they were. I heard\r\nBraman chuckle. He said: \"Bring him along to Foster's house at 10.30,\"\r\nand added: \"It wouldn't be a bad idea to have an ambulance along, too.\"\r\nThis suggested further complications, for Braman has the reputation on\r\n\"the Street\" of being more eager to face a wild man on a rampage than a\r\nsick one in a plaster cast, while Foster, although a little bit of a\r\nfellow, was never known to side-step or duck trouble. I slipped word\r\ndown to Moore at the Waldorf to follow along to Foster's place in a cab.\r\n\r\nThere are several \"spite houses\" in New York. Foster's house was one of\r\nthem. It is a narrow strip of a brownstone dwelling at 79 West 54th\r\nStreet, built to express the enmity of one property owner for his\r\nneighbor who refused to pay an extortionate price for the land. It is\r\nabout the width of a front door, and inside there is just about room to\r\nmove around. It afforded a queer background for the scene enacted there\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nPromptly at 10.30 Addicks and I were at the door, and by 10.32 the\r\ntunnel-like walls of the \"spite house\" resounded with as illuminating a\r\nverbal interchange of billingsgate biographies as I have ever listened\r\nto. At 10.35 I covered Addicks in a hasty but quite successful retreat\r\nwhich he beat to our cab. Thence to the Hoffman House, where I summoned\r\nParker Chandler to aid in the calming of our raving associate. The next\r\ntwo hours were of the pulse-jumping, vein-tearing kind incidental to\r\n\"frenzied finance,\" but they were not without avail, for Addicks finally\r\nagreed that he might consent to \"something\" provided the Bay State\r\nequities in the Boston companies were so preserved that he could\r\neventually get them back into his hands by repayment to Rogers or by the\r\nredemption of bonds.\r\n\r\nHaving got thus far, I again went after Braman and Foster, who were at\r\nthe Hotel Cambridge. We repaired for further conference to the\r\nUniversity Club, which was then in the old A. T. Stewart marble palace\r\non the corner of Thirty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue. I shall never\r\nforget that session. It was past midnight, but the three of us battled\r\nwith our smoky problem, now good-naturedly, now bitterly. At times it\r\nlooked hopeless because of this obstinate demand or that steadfast\r\nrefusal. It must have been three o'clock in the morning when I left them\r\nand stepped into the Waldorf for a moment to relieve Moore's vigil. Then\r\nback again to the Hoffman, where Addicks, Chandler, and some Bay State\r\ndirectors were nodding. By this time I was in no mood to say more than\r\nthat I would be over in the morning, and that Addicks should go early to\r\nthe National Committee's head-quarters and explain the desperation of\r\nconditions in Delaware to Hanna, Osborne, and their associates. At last\r\nI was free to return to the Brunswick for a few hours' rest.\r\n\r\nIn the country, cock-crow is the signal to be up and doing. In the city,\r\nthe signal to be up and to do is a hoarse, metallic roar that would\r\ndrown a million country cock-crows if each particular cock were as big\r\nas the mythical rooster of antiquity and could crow in proportion to his\r\nsize. My readers who dwell on the hills and in dales and wheat-fields,\r\nand who are unfamiliar with the wild, weird early morning din of the\r\ncity, may not know that the metropolitan cock-crow is made up of the\r\njingle and jangle of a million tin milk cans jolted over a million\r\nblocks of stone to the tune of thousands of steel-shod feet, the shrill\r\ncries of an army of butcher and baker boys and the groans and the moans\r\nof countless troubled and tortured human souls. Cock-crow in the country\r\nmeans \"Awake to another day of life.\" Cock-crow in the city is a signal\r\nfor the slaves of Mammon to arise to another interval of flight and\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nThe great city cock was just getting ready to send forth his hoarse cry\r\nas I went to bed, and he was still on his roost a few hours later, when\r\nI awoke. I looked from my window of the Brunswick across the Square, now\r\nflooded with the pure sunlight of early morning, and all the kinks and\r\nquirks and hobgoblins which the rush and irritation of yesterday had\r\ngenerated seemed to have vanished, and I could not suppress a smile at\r\nthe thought of the night before, when this battle--this puny,\r\ninsignificant battle for a few dirty dollars--had almost raised feelings\r\nI now knew too well should only be aroused by real battles, battles in\r\nwhich noble principles were involved, and I felt better able to fight\r\nwhat I had thought, the night before, was going to be a hard battle.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" said I, as I looked away and beyond the park to the grand\r\nbattlefields of my better imagination, \"what will it matter a hundred\r\nyears hence what name appears against victor or vanquished in the\r\narchives of fame or the records of infamy when the student reads, 'A.D.\r\n1896, Bay State Gas-\"Standard Oil\" war,'\" for I saw that among the\r\ncountless real deeds there would be no room for any record to mark the\r\nexistence of any Gas or Dollar war.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts still in mind I sat down to breakfast with Parker\r\nChandler, and as I listened to his cheerful gossip of yesterday, I\r\ninwardly resolved that whatever the result of the day's effort, I would\r\ntake it with a smile.\r\n\r\nThursday was another period of strenuous struggle and unceasing effort.\r\nI began early, and every moment was taken up with arguments, wrangles,\r\npleadings! Chandler had agreed to see that Addicks kept his appointment\r\nwith the National Committee and that a quorum of Bay State directors\r\nshould be on hand in the Hoffman so that we could get quick action on\r\nany proposition that came up. This arranged I hurried over to see John\r\nMoore, then down for a last word with Mr. Rogers. Addicks came next for\r\na spell; from him to Braman and Foster; back to John Moore; more\r\ninterviews with lawyers and round the circle again. It seemed as though\r\nit were impossible to arrive at any agreement that some one of the\r\nprincipals interested would not kick over. At four o'clock Friday\r\nmorning John Moore and myself ceased our labors for the day, both of us\r\nwellnigh exhausted. With all our efforts many of the vital points to our\r\nagreement were still in the air. A few hours' sleep and we were back at\r\nour task, and by six o'clock on Friday night the last obstacle had been\r\novercome and the deal was completed.\r\n\r\nThere remained now the tremendous business of putting all the\r\narrangements concluded into execution. A multitude of legal documents\r\nhad to be drawn up and executed, first by Rogers and then by the Bay\r\nState board of directors and officers. It was a pile of work, but not a\r\nsecond was lost, and by 11.20 that night we were ready for the third\r\nact, which was to be performed simultaneously by different sets of\r\nactors in Boston and Wilmington. For this our officers were split. With\r\nthe directors of the Boston corporations, Chandler, and Mr. Rogers'\r\nattorney to supervise the legal end of next day's transaction, I left on\r\na special car attached to the midnight train for Boston; while Addicks\r\nand the Bay State directors set forth on another midnight train for\r\nWilmington, Del., to be followed in the early morning by my New York\r\npartner, John Moore's partner, Braman, Foster, and more counsel\r\nrepresenting Mr. Rogers. This contingent was to carry the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCLING OF THE VULTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't believe there ever was before or since a financial operation in\r\nwhich so many things, each of vital importance, had to be done at one\r\nand the same time.\r\n\r\nBefore I took the train for Boston, just after the last deed had been\r\nsigned, Braman, Foster, and I had come to a complete understanding in\r\nregard to the manner in which the court proceedings the following\r\nmorning should be conducted. It was understood that no one should take\r\nanother's word for anything, and consequently that no money should pass\r\nuntil specific performance of all the required conditions. Immediately\r\non the release of the receivership, Foster and Braman were to be paid\r\ntheir \"fee,\" and they asked that the $175,000 cash coming to them should\r\nbe arranged in separate piles of bills. The two packages containing\r\nFoster's and part of Buchanan's, and Braman's $50,000 were to be in the\r\njoint custody of John Moore's representative and my partner, who, with\r\nRogers' counsel and Addicks, had been assigned to represent Bay State in\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen after the transfer of these several amounts was\r\noutside my jurisdiction. Addicks did not confide to me his own scheme of\r\nrevenge, but of Braman and Foster's purposes I had a clear idea. As\r\nBraman had explained, the great winning of his adventure should be made\r\nin the stock plunge he and Foster contemplated in Bay State Gas stock,\r\nthen selling at 3-1/2 to 4; but lest there be some slip-up in court,\r\n\"buy\" orders to their brokers were contingent on the word \"go!\" from\r\nWilmington. To get this off at the right moment a clerk was taken along,\r\nwhose only part in the play was to telephone this word \"go!\" They\r\nexpected in this way to make at least half a million.[16]\r\n\r\nAddicks' intentions, as I afterward learned, were less exalted but much\r\nmore direct. He had conceived a plan whereby without danger to himself\r\nhe could punish Braman and Foster for the wrong they had done Bay State,\r\nand at the same time meet his election expenses at no cost to his own\r\npocket. In the course of his electioneering campaign in Delaware,\r\nconducted as all the world knows how, Addicks had gathered to his cause\r\nas tough and rascally a set of \"heelers\" as ever waylaid aged woman or\r\nlame man on the highway. A lieutenant who had been despatched to\r\nDelaware early Friday afternoon, when it had become evident that we\r\nshould get things settled up, gathered the sturdiest members of this\r\nprecious troop together and solemnly told them that a serious hitch had\r\noccurred in Addicks' game and that it looked as though, owing to the\r\nreceivership, there would be no \"stuff\" to put in circulation this year.\r\nThe men responsible for this outrage were to be in Wilmington on the\r\nfollowing day and from the appearance of things would get the money\r\nAddicks had destined for his followers. He understood they were to\r\nreceive it in cash, too--$175,000--cash that really belonged to Addicks,\r\nwho had intended it for his good friends in Delaware. The thugs,\r\nproperly indignant at the wrong that had been done \"the Boss,\" dispersed\r\nrapidly to discuss the information among themselves. That night a group\r\nof leaders got together and figured out a little plan of campaign to\r\nfrustrate the robbery of their beloved master. Court proceedings to\r\nrelease the receivership could not take long, and they calculated that\r\nthe train schedule would detain Braman and Foster at least two hours in\r\nWilmington after the adjournment. What more easy than the organizing of\r\na little scuffle on the station platform or on the street and in the\r\nrush--well, many things happen in a rush. This simple procedure\r\ncommended itself to all concerned, and that night there was much\r\nrejoicing among the Addicks camp-followers at the pleasant things that\r\nshould be pulled \"off\" at the flim-flamming bee next day.\r\n\r\nAll these things were in the air when court opened in Wilmington on\r\nSaturday morning. A special telephone line had been run and\r\narrangements made for a clear wire right into the directors' office in\r\nthe head-quarters of the Gas Light Company in Boston. At the telephone\r\nin Wilmington sat my partner ready to communicate to me the exact course\r\nof the proceedings, so that I might simultaneously make the agreed\r\ntransfers of our companies to Rogers. I knew my partner's voice; he knew\r\nmine. We, too, were taking no chances.\r\n\r\n     * NEW YORK, February 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Mr. Lawson_: In your article in _Everybody's Magazine_\r\n     for January, among other misstatements upon which I shall\r\n     not now comment--since you have committed yourself too far\r\n     to make it likely that you will withdraw them--you accuse me\r\n     of having speculated in Bay State Gas stock with Mr.\r\n     Buchanan's money; and of having subsequently been sued by\r\n     him. I hold Mr. Buchanan's receipt for the money collected\r\n     for him, which I paid him the night that I returned from\r\n     Delaware. He has never sued me. Please inform me whether you\r\n     are willing and agree to strike out these statements from\r\n     your article when published in book form, and also whether\r\n     you will agree to withdraw the same in your magazine. I\r\n     tried to call on you and discuss the case when in Boston,\r\n     January 21st; and I also tried to meet you on the day after\r\n     last Thanksgiving; but apparently you were unwilling to see\r\n     me. I remain,\r\n\r\n     Very truly yours,\r\n         ROGER FOSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON, ESQ.,\r\n     Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     FEBRUARY 23, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Mr. Foster_: I received your letter of the 21st\r\n     inst., and in reply will say, if I have done you any wrong\r\n     in my story, \"Frenzied Finance,\" or otherwise, it has been\r\n     unintentional, and I regret it, and I seek this, the first\r\n     opportunity, to give my regrets the same wide circulation as\r\n     my original statements.\r\n\r\n     As I wrote you previous to the publication of the magazine\r\n     containing the parts you refer to, I try to exercise the\r\n     greatest care in allowing nothing to appear in my story but\r\n     facts--facts I know to be facts, and in addition only such\r\n     facts as are absolutely necessary to my work, which is the\r\n     portrayal of those events of the past essential to a proper\r\n     understanding by the people of the evils that have been done\r\n     them, and how they have been done, that they may do what is\r\n     necessary to undo them and to prevent their repetition in\r\n     the future, and, in addition, such facts as it is fair for\r\n     me to use. I repeat what I said to you then: I have\r\n     absolutely no feeling in regard to you other than an intense\r\n     desire to do you exact justice.\r\n\r\n     I dealt with you in the entire Bay State receivership affair\r\n     in connection with Mr. Braman and I thought that I had every\r\n     reason to believe that his Bay State Gas purchases were for\r\n     your joint account; but now that you assure me they were\r\n     not, I hasten to have such assurances chase my original\r\n     story with the hope that they may speedily overtake it.\r\n\r\n     My information that you had been sued by Mr. Buchanan came\r\n     to me in a way that left no doubt in my mind of its\r\n     correctness--no doubt until I received your letter. Papers\r\n     were sent to me some time ago by reputable attorneys in a\r\n     suit of Buchanan against Braman and, I understood, yourself,\r\n     along the lines outlined in my story, with the request that\r\n     I allow my deposition to be taken, so that Buchanan could\r\n     get at the facts in his attempt to recover the moneys\r\n     claimed.\r\n\r\n     Your assurances to the contrary in regard to this matter I\r\n     also hasten to start on the road you point out, and I will\r\n     see that both statements are expunged from my book.\r\n\r\n     You are in error in thinking that I did not wish to see you\r\n     when you were in Boston. I did not know in either case of\r\n     your desires until it was too late to see you. I certainly\r\n     would have had a \"sit-down\" with you if it had been\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n     Again assuring you not only that it is a pleasure to set\r\n     forth the facts you have called to my attention, but that I\r\n     am your debtor inasmuch as you have given me an opportunity\r\n     to perform that duty which I owe to every individual my\r\n     story treats of--to state facts and only facts with which\r\n     they have been connected--believe me,\r\n\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n         THOMAS W. LAWSON.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] See foot-note on pages 189 and 190.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nCOURT CORRUPTION AND COIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing scene of this most significant drama was enacted on Saturday\r\nmorning in the Wilmington Circuit Court-room. There was nothing in the\r\ncold formality of the proceedings to indicate that here was the\r\n_dénouement_ of a serio-comedy in which greed and ambition had clashed\r\nin a battle for millions; nor in the amiable indifference of the men who\r\ngot within the enclosed space below the judge's desk to suggest the\r\nmurderous passions and fierce hatreds raging beneath the surface of the\r\nprevailing calm.\r\n\r\nThe _dramatis personæ_ were gathered in little groups representing the\r\nseparate interests--Addicks and some of his lieutenants; my partner at\r\nthe telephone; John Moore's partner and Rogers' counsel with their heads\r\ntogether; Braman and Foster nearer the judge, their eyes wandering\r\ntoward two dress-suit cases piled before John Moore's partner, which, it\r\nwas understood, contained the money. At a glance it was impossible to\r\ntell the one containing Buchanan's share from the other laden with the\r\nreceivership loot, but each was tagged, and it was evident that\r\npossibilities of a mix-up had been carefully guarded against. Behind\r\nBraman was his clerk, and in the rear of the court-room sat as many of\r\nAddicks' thugs as could squeeze into the narrow space reserved for\r\nspectators. They, too, eyed the dress-suit cases avidly, for the\r\ninformation had been passed around that these innocent receptacles\r\ncontained the \"stuff,\" of which the \"Boss\" was about to be robbed.\r\n\r\nCourt came to order. Foster rose, announced that the claims of his\r\nclient had been satisfied, and made a formal motion to dismiss the\r\nreceivership. The Court formally consented, and as the clerk was\r\nentering the dismissal in his minute-book my partner telephoned the\r\nfacts to me. I sent back the word that my directors were resigning--had\r\nresigned--that Rogers' directors were being elected--had been\r\nelected--that the Boston gas companies were now transferred to Rogers.\r\nMy partner whispered my words to John Moore's partner and Rogers'\r\ncounsel. At once the two dress-suit cases, each loaded with currency,\r\nwere slipped to Braman and Foster. At the same time the messenger who\r\nwas to telephone to their broker rose and quickly left the court-room. A\r\nbrief period was consumed in signing receipts, certificates, and other\r\nlegal papers, and then the performance was over. Addicks rose and went\r\nout among his henchmen in the rear, who eagerly surrounded him. In the\r\nbustle Braman and Foster, each with his own booty, fled.\r\n\r\nLet us see what was happening at the Boston end of the wire while all\r\nthis dumb show was being enacted in the Wilmington court-house. My\r\ndirectors and officials were lined up against the walls of the\r\ndirectors' room in the Boston Gas Light Company's office like so many\r\nmembers of young John D. Rockefeller's Sunday-school class, inasmuch as\r\nthey were prepared to listen, sing, or shout \"Amen!\" at any time they\r\nreceived the nod of the class-leader. In an adjoining room Rogers'\r\ncounsel had a similar line-up, with the difference that my men were\r\nabout to shed the crowns which the others were waiting to receive, and\r\nwhich would transform them from humble business men into royal gas\r\nkings. Through the open wire I was in such close touch with the scene in\r\nthe Wilmington court-room that I was almost sure I heard the subdued\r\nweeping of the blindfolded Lady of the Scales on the bills which\r\noccupied such a prominent part in the disreputable proceedings. Nothing\r\nnow could impede the course of events, so I concluded to take Time by\r\nthe headgear and secure what Bay State stock was in the market before\r\nBraman and Foster got in their work. Over another wire which was at my\r\nelbow I gave the word \"go!\" to my own brokers in Boston and New York,\r\nand when a few minutes later they told me they were securing thousands\r\nof shares, and that the stock was climbing toward 10, I could not\r\nrepress an inward chuckle at the thought that the money we had so\r\nreluctantly parted with would spread over only one-half or one-third the\r\nsurface it was originally intended to cover.\r\n\r\nIt was all over in a few minutes, and when my partner said, \"It's done,\"\r\nand \"By Jove, there go Dwight Braman and Roger Foster on the dead run\r\nwith a dress-suit case apiece!\" I held my sides as Parker Chandler in\r\nhis inimitable way bawled: \"Tom, let's leave our straw hats on the pegs,\r\nfor we'll probably be back next spring figuring out how to pump air\r\nenough through the gas-measuring meters to pay for that money we've just\r\nloaned Braman and Foster for a day or two.\"\r\n\r\nBraman and Foster, as I have observed before, knew their business. The\r\ndanger to which $175,000 in currency would be exposed, in a territory\r\ncontrolled by Addicks, had appealed to their cautious instincts, and\r\nonce outside the court-room they literally took to their heels and ran\r\nfor a corner of the railway yard, where awaiting them was a special car\r\nand engine. They jumped aboard, yelling to the engineer: \"Let her go.\"\r\nIn the meantime eager-eyed ruffians searched the streets and hung round\r\nthe hotels, looking for two men with dress-suit cases. A hundred of them\r\nwere on the station platform, awaiting the departure of the regular\r\ntrain. Ten minutes before leaving-time one of the henchmen appeared\r\namong the gang, and passed round the word that the gents and the \"stuff\"\r\nhad got off by a special, and it was no use waiting any longer. Later\r\nthat afternoon, Addicks, to use his own words, in one of his rendezvous,\r\n\"dealt out his own good money in place of that he had hoped would take\r\ncare of the people's rights.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a fierce session of the Stock Exchange that Saturday morning.\r\nShortly before closing time a new set of brokers were frantically\r\ngrabbing for Bay State stock round 10, and Monday morning, when all the\r\nworld knew that the receivership had been lifted and our company was\r\nitself again, the same crowd continued to buy fiercely. To these eager\r\npurchasers I resold all that I had previously gathered, and enough\r\nshort besides, to compensate me for some of the losses I had previously\r\nsuffered, for this latter I was enabled to repurchase at half price,\r\nwhen news came that another suit had begun against Bay State. This\r\nlatter drop in price so shattered the nerves of Braman and Foster that\r\nthey retired, having made up their minds that they did not know quite as\r\nmuch about one end of \"frenzied finance\" as they did about the other. As\r\na matter of fact, nothing came of the suit in question, for it was\r\nevident when the transfer of the Boston gas companies to Rogers' control\r\nbecame known, that Bay State Gas receiverships had played their last\r\nsuccessful engagement.\r\n\r\nMy readers will not object if I again call their attention to the\r\ninevitable workings of the law of compensation. The losses occasioned by\r\nthe market action of Bay State stock in these four days so mixed up\r\nBraman and Foster in their financial accounts that later they were sued\r\nby their client, Buchanan, who in court stated that he in turn was so\r\nconfused as to what was done in connection with this business that he\r\nreally knew less after it was over than before the suits were brought.\r\nBut one thing was indelibly impressed upon his mind--that his bonds had\r\ndisappeared in the whirl and he had not received anything for them. I\r\nthink this suit is still pending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nPEACE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain fell on the closing scene of the performance in the\r\nDelaware court there ensued a brief interval of quiet in the affairs of\r\nBay State Gas. Rejoicing in the temporary diversion of public attention,\r\nthe chief actors proceeded to assume their former rôles, and soon\r\naffairs began to move at their old gait. Rogers took possession of all\r\nthe Boston gas companies and patiently awaited the coming down the pike\r\nof some traveller with more money than brains. Having successfully\r\ncorrupted the State of Delaware, Addicks was being measured for the\r\nsenatorial toga, when accidentally the blind lady dropped her scales on\r\nhis unprotected head, which catastrophe laid him out long enough to\r\nenable another to sneak the prize he had so long striven for. We are not\r\nat present concerned with the affairs of Delaware, and it suffices to\r\nsay in passing, that after a heated contest one Richard Kenney was\r\nchosen to the senatorial seat Addicks had so long coveted, and that this\r\nman, a typical Delaware vote-rancher, after being sworn in as United\r\nStates Senator, was brought back to Wilmington and tried for robbing a\r\nDelaware bank, his accomplices being some other heelers of Addicks. The\r\ndisclosures made in the trial showed that the case in all\r\ncharacteristics conformed to the Addicks standard of indecency, for the\r\nbank officials, not satisfied with \"blowing in\" every dollar of deposits\r\nand capital the institution owned or controlled, had actually \"lifted\"\r\nin addition the building in which the bank was situated. One of the\r\ncourt functionaries who had heard the evidence tersely remarked: \"Talk\r\nabout stealing a red-hot stove: this is a case where they took the\r\nfunnel with it to keep the draught going until they set it up in a new\r\nlocation!\"\r\n\r\nBut Delaware, as my readers have doubtless gathered long ere this, is\r\nits own kind of a country, and rewards and punishments are so perversely\r\nadjusted that it seems a sort of Topsyturvydom. In this instance certain\r\nof Addicks' heelers went to State's prison and death; Kenney returned to\r\nthe Senate to help make laws for the great free people of America, while\r\nthe chief conspirator, with a threat to sue the blindfolded lady for\r\ndamage done, began to set out the pieces on the Bay State Gas chessboard\r\nwith a view to trying certain new moves that had occurred to his\r\nperpetual-motion mind.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Bay State Gas stock was fully understood by the public.\r\nWhile Rogers had possession of the Boston companies, he simply held them\r\nin trust, and must give them up whenever the parent corporation had coin\r\nenough to redeem them. The securities were still in the hands of the\r\npublic and my friends, and my own duty to get Bay State Gas on its feet\r\nwas plain. It was again a case of raising money, and to do this we had\r\nthe issue of securities which we were preparing to float just before\r\nFoster and Braman swooped down on us. Addicks agreed that if I would\r\nundertake the marketing of this stock, he would issue only enough of it\r\nto redeem the properties from Rogers. His directors met and formally\r\n\"resoluted\" on this point, and I felt satisfied before going ahead that\r\nthere was no danger of this money being put in jeopardy without actually\r\nstealing it. The company, for the nonce, had no other business but to\r\npay office rent and clerk hire, and in spite of Addicks' financial\r\nimmorality, all who knew him were aware he took no chances of ever\r\ngetting himself sent to jail. So I began to sell the stock in the open\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC WORLD OF FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThough this is the twentieth century and enlightenment is supposed to\r\nprevail throughout this broad land of ours, the majority of people still\r\nregard the world of finance as the world of magic. Within the fairy\r\nrealm of finance the laws of nature apparently are suspended, and,\r\novernight, wonders are worked. The ordinary mortal, wise in all other\r\nwalks of life, sees the man who yesterday stood beside him at the plough\r\nor at the bench emerging from the mysterious portals bearing the fruits\r\nof the endeavors of a hundred or a thousand lives, although a moment ago\r\nhe passed through them with nothing. Who can deny the magic that thus\r\ndemonstrates its power, or fail to accord veneration to the magicians\r\nthat work such marvels? No wonder the ordinary mortal feels that he has\r\nno license to enter the world of finance save on his knees, hat in hand,\r\nbearing tribute to the divinities enthroned within this enchanted\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to do away with this extraordinary deception and to\r\nshow it up as one of the artifices with which tricksters, since the\r\nbeginning of the world, have imposed upon the people. There should be\r\nnothing in finance that any man or woman of ordinary intelligence and\r\nexperience cannot understand, and I purpose to explain here the\r\nmachinery of the \"System\" so that every one will exactly understand it\r\nfrom headlight to rear-end lantern. Many intelligent people have no\r\nclear idea of what a certificate of stock or a bond really is, and the\r\nwords \"money,\" \"stock-exchange,\" and \"finance\" are mere terms which they\r\nglibly use without knowledge of their meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand the grocery or the dry-goods business.\r\nStandard articles of well-known form are sold by weight or measure over\r\nthe counters for fair prices. The patrons of such businesses insist on\r\nknowing what they are buying--what they are to get in exchange for the\r\nmoney which is the fruit of their labor, and then, after they have been\r\ntold, and they trade, they require that the goods be as described or\r\nthey will know why not. The average American would consider it a huge\r\njoke should his grocer undertake to induce him to buy one hundred times\r\nmore sugar than he could use, on the ground that he might find in the\r\nsugar bags when he reached home gold and diamonds. But would he not\r\nwrathfully seek the police if, after opening his sugar bag, for which he\r\nhad paid $1, he found it contained only 50 cents' worth of sugar? He\r\nwould tell you if you met him at this stage: \"You can bet that chap on\r\nthe corner cannot get away with any such trick as that--not in America.\r\nHe might in Zanzibar or in the kingdom of the Sultan of Sulu, but I will\r\nshow him he cannot rob Americans in these enlightened times.\" The grocer\r\nwould be hustled to jail without a \"by your leave,\" and thenceforward\r\nhis name would be a by-word among all honest tradesmen.\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes in every business but finance--finance, the most\r\nimportant of all, the business into which is merged all other\r\nbusinesses, the business of taking and preserving the results of all\r\nother businesses, of all other human endeavor. Over our land to-day are\r\nbig, able Americans, long-headed and experienced, adept at a jack-knife\r\nswap or a horse trade--industrious farmers, hard-handed miners, shrewd\r\nmanufacturers, each in his own line a good business man, yet these\r\nsturdy traders, whom the \"gold-brick\" artist or the \"green-goods\"\r\npractitioner would never dream of tackling, come weekly into Wall\r\nStreet, or into such branch shops as exist in every community on the\r\ncontinent, and are done out of their savings like the veriest\r\n\"come-ons.\" Humbly they take, in return for the gold earned with the\r\nsweat of their brows, a piece of paper of a given value which they\r\nreturn later and exchange for half the amount the paper cost them\r\noriginally. In the space between purchase and sale fifty per cent. of\r\ntheir investment has disappeared--has been filched away, but yet they\r\nhave no resentment. They evince none of the feelings of the man whose\r\npocket has been picked or whose till has been robbed. On the contrary,\r\ntheir sentiment is of admiration for the banker, the broker, the\r\nfinancier through whose agency their money has been lost.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the prosperous tanner who goes to his banker with\r\n$100,000, the fruit of ten years' success, and exchanges this sum for\r\n1,000 shares of Steel Preferred. Now, if he were to examine this\r\nsecurity with half the thought or investigation he gives to a $500\r\ncar-load of bark, he would learn that there was not 20 cents on the\r\ndollar of real value behind it. In six months the eminent tanner is\r\nagain at the banker's offering for sale his thousand shares of steel. In\r\nthe meantime it has declined in value and he has to part with it for\r\n$50,000. But he does not complain; indeed, he bows his way out of the\r\npalatial office of the great man and is full of sincere thanks when the\r\nbanker promises to let him know the next good thing on the market.\r\nSuppose our tanner had purchased ten cars of tan bark and found that\r\neach car-load was short ten per cent. Would he not at once go to his\r\nattorney and exclaim emphatically that he would spend thousands rather\r\nthan let the scoundrel who had tricked him get away with his swag?\r\n\r\nSuppose our grocer waxing rich invests his funds in the Sugar trust. He\r\nthinks he knows all there is to be known about sugar. The business of\r\nthe trust is to make the sweet commodity and sell it to the people. No\r\nmystery or magic, surely, about this simple pursuit. Yet when our grocer\r\ninvests his savings, the sugar stock is many dollars more valuable than\r\nwhen, scared into selling by fluctuations which he cannot see any reason\r\nfor, he tries to get back his investment. So many times have investors\r\nbeen milked of their savings by this one trust during the past twenty\r\nyears that in the coffers of its creators and jugglers are hundreds of\r\nmillions of money that once belonged to the people for which they have\r\nreceived absolutely nothing in return.\r\n\r\nBoth the tanner and the grocer must know, when they look up and down\r\nWall Street at the great office buildings which tower into the sky on\r\neither side of the street, that these are huge hives of expensive bees\r\nwho, from New Year's to New Year's, do not produce a dollar. They should\r\nrealize that the hundreds of millions spent each year for the expense of\r\nrunning the \"System's\" game, and the millions which the game-makers\r\nflaunt in their faces, must have been derived from such as they--the men\r\nwho produce.\r\n\r\nIt is the phenomenon of the age that millions of people throughout this\r\ngreat country of ours come of their own free will to the shearing pens\r\nof the \"System\" each year, voluntarily chloroform themselves, so that\r\nthe \"System\" may go through their pockets, and then depart peacefully\r\nhome to dig and delve for more money that they may have the debasing\r\noperation repeated on them twelve months later.\r\n\r\nYou may ask if I desire to convey the idea that the great financial\r\ninstitutions and trusts of this country, which have their head centre in\r\nWall Street, are all concerned in a conspiracy to rob the people of\r\ntheir savings. You think, doubtless, that so sweeping a statement goes\r\nbeyond the truth. I desire to go on record right here in declaring that\r\nall financial institutions which in any way are engaged in taking from\r\nthe people the money that is their surplus earnings or their capital,\r\nfor the ostensible purpose of safeguarding it, or putting it in use for\r\nthem, or exchanging it for stocks, bonds, policies, or other paper\r\nevidences of worth, are a part of the machinery for the plundering of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThis is a terrible charge, I am well aware, but it is based upon a\r\nthorough knowledge of the subject and made with a full appreciation of\r\nits gravity. I do not mean to say that all the men who handle and\r\ncontrol the different institutions I mentioned have guilty knowledge of\r\nthe bearing of their actions. Many of them are of the purest minds and\r\nmost honest intentions, and are quite incapable of participating\r\nvoluntarily in a conspiracy to wrong any one. They do not know, however,\r\nthat the relation between their own minor institution and the general\r\nfinancial structure constitutes the former an agency for the \"System,\"\r\nwhich controls and has organized the general financial structure into an\r\ninstrument for converting the money of the public to its own purposes.\r\nIn fact, the \"System\" has cunningly possessed itself of the financial\r\nmechanism of the country and is running it, not for the object for which\r\nthe machine was devised, but for the benefit and personal profit of its\r\nvotaries, and so the vast correlated organization of banks, trust\r\ncompanies, and insurance corporations which were brought into being for\r\nthe safe handling of the people's savings has become an agency for\r\ntransferring these savings to the control of unscrupulous manipulators,\r\nwho take liberal toll of every dollar that passes through their hands.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the American people is to unloosen the thraldom of the\r\n\"System\" on our financial mechanism; to pluck out of their high places\r\nthe dishonest usurpers who have degraded the purposes of our financial\r\ninstitutions, and to restore those institutions to their legitimate\r\nfunctions. When the people are fully awakened to the condition I\r\ndescribe, surely they will arise in their wrath and sweep the\r\nmoney-changers from the temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE \"SYSTEM\" AND THE LOUISIANA LOTTERY COMPARED\r\n\r\n\r\nYears ago one of the greatest evils in this country was the Louisiana\r\nLottery. Through that lottery millions and millions annually were taken\r\nfrom the people and transferred to a few unprincipled schemers, who soon\r\nfound themselves in possession of enormous fortunes. Wise men called for\r\nthe abatement of this awful drain on the savings of the nation, but the\r\nlaw-abiding, God-fearing people of the country met their plaints with\r\n\"Why should we be bothered about this matter? If fools and knaves elect\r\nto gamble in such palpably fraudulent ways, let them gamble, and their\r\nlosses are no affair of ours. It is none of our business.\" But presently\r\nthese honest people had it pounded into their well-meaning heads that\r\nthe principal instrument by which the swindle was conducted was their\r\nown mail service, one of the most important branches of their\r\nGovernment; that, in fact, in each and every city, town, village, and\r\ncross-road in all our virtuous land, Government officials were acting as\r\ndistributing agents for this huge corrupter and robber.\r\n\r\nThen the people rose in their irresistible might, and between the rising\r\nof one day's sun and its setting this powerful machine went as goes the\r\ngum-drop on the red-hot stove cover at a pop-corn soirée. It melted,\r\nleaving nothing but a faint odor and a thin stain, both of which\r\ndisappeared in the next morning's scrubbing, and the Louisiana Lottery\r\nwas as though it had never been. Yet during its reign its insolent\r\nvotaries could prove to the absolute satisfaction of all intelligent,\r\npatriotic men that it was useless for any man or set of men to attempt\r\nthe lottery's destruction, because they would be met with the\r\naccumulated resistance of the reckless spending of the vast amounts of\r\nfestered dollars which had been stolen from the people. The argument of\r\nthese comparatively petty thieves was: \"No men nor sets of men can hope\r\nto 'stack up' against us, for their money comes hard, cents and dollars\r\nat a time; they are obliged to earn it, while we get ours in chunks by\r\nsimply taking it. We can buy lawyers and can hire law-makers, and we can\r\nlease Government officials, and we can outbid any honest men, who are\r\nthe only ones who object to our game. In the market for legislative or\r\nbusiness talent you cannot get within touching distance of us.\" Yet the\r\npeople had but to sneeze and this foul parasite was detached from their\r\nfree and honest structure and was wafted away with the dead leaves and\r\nthe dust to bottomless nowhere.\r\n\r\nIn the height of its prosperity the Louisiana Lottery took from the\r\npeople only a paltry ten or twenty million dollars a year, while to-day\r\nthere are single groups of banks, trust companies, corporations, and\r\ntrusts which take from the people by might, by trick, and by theft\r\nhundreds of millions each year; and there are scores of such groups. The\r\nSugar trust has been the instrument of gathering, in one year, a hundred\r\nmillions of the people's savings, and the Steel trust alone has robbed\r\nthe people of over five hundred millions of dollars in a single twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nTo-day the \"System\" and its methods are as clearly and as sharply\r\ndefined in the tangibility of their relation to the people as was ever\r\nthe Louisiana Lottery. On certain days the Louisiana Lottery sold its\r\ntickets, which the people bought with their savings. On a certain day\r\nthe drawing took place, at which all those who had parted with their\r\ndollars expected to receive them back together with immense profits, and\r\nupon that day disappointment was spread broadcast among the many and\r\nunhealthy joy among the few. So with the \"System.\" On certain days the\r\npublic is sold their stock, bond, and insurance policy certificates.\r\nUpon other days they look for their savings and profits. On the\r\ncontrary, they learn that their savings have decreased in value or have\r\nbeen wiped out, and that there never was any chance of profit. My\r\ncritics will say that such a comparison cannot hold, for in the lottery\r\nnothing was dealt in but gambling tickets, whereas the stock or bond\r\ncertificate represents an ownership in the material things of the\r\ncountry. This is the fallacy the \"System\" spends millions every year to\r\nfoster and disseminate. Between the two the difference is in favor of\r\nthe Louisiana Lottery, for both are gambles and the lottery game was\r\nsquare. Those who ran it had for their trouble a fixed percentage of the\r\nprofits, an enormous percentage, it is true, but the general fund was\r\nnever encroached upon by the controllers. Who is to say what percentage\r\nthe votaries of the \"System\" take in their game? It depends on how much\r\ntheir victims have to lose. The public have been persuaded, too, that in\r\npurchasing stocks they do not gamble, but only invest, or, at the worst,\r\nspeculate, so they are deceived as well as plundered. A few millions\r\neach year satisfied the lottery owners; the votaries of the \"System,\"\r\namong whom the \"swag\" must be divided, demand millions upon millions\r\neach. The tickets of the lottery had a definite value at all times until\r\nthe drawing took place. The stocks and bonds of the \"System\" have no\r\nrigid or unalterable value when issued or at any other time, and do not\r\nrepresent a fixed ownership in all the savings of the people which have\r\nbeen paid for them.\r\n\r\nMorally, legally, or ethically, the Louisiana Lottery, with all its\r\nattendant curses, was a far better institution for the people to bump up\r\nagainst every month than is the \"System\" against which the whole people\r\nare now directly or indirectly dealing every working day of the year.\r\nStartling this statement may be, but not more startling than the facts.\r\nThe records of the lottery company will show how many dollars it took in\r\nfrom the public; how many were returned in prizes and expenses; and how\r\nmany went into the pockets of the owners. The records of the banks,\r\ncorporations, trusts, and stock-exchanges will exhibit how many dollars\r\nwere paid into the \"System\" by the people; how much they received back\r\nin return therefor; how much the expense of conducting the business was;\r\nand how much profit went to the votaries of the \"System.\" Compare the\r\ntwo and it will be found that there is annually taken by the \"System\"\r\nfrom the people a hundred, yes, a thousand times more than the Louisiana\r\nLottery ever obtained in the same period.\r\n\r\nThis being the fact, for how long will the people allow such a monstrous\r\nwrong to be done? How long will they suffer a few men to siphon\r\nautomatically the money of the many into their own pockets?\r\n\r\nIt is only a matter of simple mathematics to ascertain the day, and that\r\nonly a few years away, when ten men will be as absolutely and completely\r\nthe legal owners of the entire United States and all there is of value\r\nin it, as John D. Rockefeller is the absolute legal owner of the large\r\nsection of it of which he is to-day possessed.\r\n\r\n_When that day is here, the people will legally be the slaves of these\r\nten men._\r\n\r\nIf this is so--and it is as surely so as it is that the Constitution of\r\nthe United States of America guarantees to every man, woman, and child\r\nwho is a part of it perpetual freedom--it is so because the legal\r\ninterest alone to which the ten men will be entitled and which they must\r\nreceive (or our entire structure will fall) will of itself bring to\r\ntheir coffers all the wealth in existence within a given time. If this\r\nis so, then why have the American people allowed themselves to reach\r\nthis condition? Why are they to-day not only resting peacefully under\r\nthis worse than death-bringing yoke, but assisting in the further\r\nriveting of this badge of dishonor and degradation?\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: They have been lulled to sleep by the \"System\" and\r\nits cunning votaries until they have but a dull appreciation not only of\r\nexisting conditions but of their coming consequences. It is almost\r\nincredible that a people as intelligent as the American people, and as\r\nalert to that individual and national honor which they have bought with\r\nso much of their blood and their peace of body and mind, can be so\r\ndeceived and juggled with. When one looks about, however, and notes\r\nhappenings of which one personally knows, and the degradation and\r\ndishonor to which public opinion is seemingly indifferent, nothing is\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nOne sees a certain man openly displaying five hundred millions of\r\ndollars, a sum which represents the life earnings of 150,000 of our\r\npopulation, and knows that this man has secured this incredible amount\r\nduring forty years of his life. One sees the second highest and most\r\nhonorable office in the nation, a United States Senatorship, openly\r\nbought for a few stolen dollars by a man who up to the very day of its\r\npurchase was a watch repairer in a small country town, and who had never\r\ndone a single meritorious deed or been possessed of worldly goods to the\r\nextent of $5,000. One sees a wily adventuress secure from the banks,\r\nwhich exist only to safeguard the people's deposited savings, hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars on her bare story that she was the possessor of\r\nsome mysterious documents. One sees a $6-a-week office-boy of one of the\r\n\"System's\" votaries able to borrow for the \"System,\" on his bare note,\r\nfour millions of dollars from a New York institution which only exists\r\nto safeguard the people's savings--although the law says that such\r\ninstitutions shall not loan to any man on any kind of collateral, even\r\nGovernment bonds, one-tenth that sum. One sees two men, drunk with their\r\nsuccess, gouging and tearing at each other's hearts in Wall Street, and\r\nsees their gouging and tearing bring about a panic which takes from the\r\npeople in an hour over a billion dollars and drives scores to suicide,\r\nmurder, and defalcation--the two men continuing meanwhile as ornamental\r\npillars of society instead of wearing prison stripes. One sees a great\r\nrailroad corporation, in which are millions of the trust funds of\r\nwidows, orphans, and charitable institutions, caught \"short\" (having\r\nsold something it did not own) in the stock-gambling game and held up to\r\nthe tune of ten million dollars by a reckless stock gambler, who says\r\n\"If you don't settle to-night it will be twenty millions to-morrow\"; and\r\nthe toll is paid, while the great banker who conducts the release of the\r\nhold-up charges the further tribute of twelve million dollars for his\r\nservices. And then one sees this twenty-two millions of \"commission\"\r\ntacked on to the capital stock of the great railroad which is\r\nsubsequently capitalized into a \"bond\" and sold to great life-insurance\r\ncompanies as a first-class investment for their trust funds.\r\n\r\nWhen one sees these things and a hundred other as rankly fraudulent, one\r\nshould not wonder at anything American connected with dollars.\r\n\r\nSuch things occur because the \"System\" has so far been able to keep the\r\npublic in ignorance of its doings. On the surface there is nothing to\r\nsuggest that a set of vampires have captured the high places of finance\r\nand are sucking away the life-blood of the nation. Our banks and trust\r\ncompanies all present a fair exterior and apparently are the same safe\r\nand honorable institutions they were before the canker fastened on them.\r\nOnly its votaries know what the \"System\" is, and their way is the way of\r\nsilence and darkness. A tie, stronger and more effective than the oath\r\nof the Mafia, binds them to its service, and woe be to him who dares\r\ndivulge its methods. He who is bold enough to enter upon a recital of\r\nthese secrets must be strong indeed to withstand the bribes to silence\r\nwhich would be placed in his hands. The \"System\" can well afford to pay\r\nany price rather than be brought face to face with its past, with an\r\nenraged people for referee. And even if the being be found who will\r\nventure an exposé of the conspiracy, he will find it strangely difficult\r\nto get his story past the traps and pitfalls which will be placed\r\nbetween it and the people for whose enlightenment it is intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS OF FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance is easy enough to comprehend if it be explained, but so long as\r\nan explanation is deadly to the interests of the men who control it, one\r\ncan be sure none will be offered. There is no term more common to-day\r\nthan \"trusts,\" and we are surrounded by \"trusts,\" institutions whose\r\nworkings during the past twenty years have awakened intense public\r\ncuriosity to know what a \"trust\" is. Yet there is not extant a\r\ndefinition of a \"trust\" which conveys to the rank and file of the people\r\nany real idea of what a \"trust\" is. So vague is the general\r\nunderstanding of the \"trust's\" functions and purposes that the most\r\nintelligent and honest statesmen struggle and hopelessly flounder when\r\nthey attempt to define them, and we have at the present time the able\r\nchief of our nation talking of regulating them by law, when, as a matter\r\nof fact, a \"trust\" is, top, sides, bottom, outsides, and insides, an\r\nabsolutely illegal institution, created outside the law, existing\r\noutside the law, and having for its purpose the performance of those\r\nthings and only those things which the law says cannot be performed\r\nlegally. Imagine our law-makers gravely meeting to make laws for the\r\ncontrol and regulation of the pick-pocket or burglar or counterfeiting\r\nindustry, or endeavoring to prescribe legally the times, places, and\r\namounts of national bank defalcations, or the kind of ink, paper, and\r\npens which must be used by forgers in the pursuit of their\r\nprofession--imagine it!\r\n\r\nIn entering upon an explanation of the workings of the \"System,\" it is\r\nnecessary to set forth plainly the fundamentals of finance, the few\r\nrules and inventions by and through which humanity regulates its\r\naffairs. In the beginning, of course, might was right and men supplied\r\ntheir wants by force, trickery, or cunning. In time the disadvantages\r\nof this became obvious, for while the stronger could overcome the weaker\r\nand satisfy desire, a combination of the weaker units acting together\r\ncould always wrest the prize from the individual. To equalize things,\r\nthe people got together and made for themselves rules and regulations\r\ngoverning the conduct of their lives and their relations with one\r\nanother. This was invention No. 1: _Law_. Presently it developed that\r\nthe physical barter of the commodities of labor was not a satisfactory\r\nbasis of exchange; so to the statutes already in existence a new one was\r\nadded providing an interchangeable token of value. This was invention\r\nNo. 2: _Money_. The statute insisted that the money be of a fair and\r\njust standard, by which all the people should receive the equivalent of\r\ntheir labor, and no more. As conditions became more settled, there grew\r\nup a realization of the value of a man's life to those dependent on him,\r\nand of the fact that when he died his wife and his children were\r\ndeprived of the livelihood his labor won for them. A new regulation was\r\nadded to the code, providing that men contributing to a fund during\r\ntheir lifetime should be entitled at death to leave to their heirs a sum\r\nin proportion to the amount of their contribution to the fund, less the\r\nactual expense of caring therefor. This was _Life Insurance_--invention\r\nNo. 3. But there were other calamities less distant than death to be\r\nguarded against, and a common fund, also based on the contributions of\r\nindividuals, to aid and relieve in case of fire and kindred calamities,\r\nwas organized. Hence invention No. 4: _Fire Insurance_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the fabric of civilization grew, each addition to the structure\r\nbeing made to cover a want which experience developed. As time went on,\r\nsome of the people accumulated the fruits of labor, money, in greater\r\nquantity than was requisite for their own needs, but which less thrifty\r\nor less fortunate brethren could so profitably employ in their own\r\naffairs as to be able to pay for its use a fair proportion of what it\r\ncould be made to earn. Thereupon provision was made for a common place\r\nof safety for this surplus money, a place where experts in the handling\r\nand putting to use of money could employ their talents, first,\r\nsafeguarding it and, then, loaning it to others. And the law was made to\r\nsay that all money put into this common place should be so guarded as to\r\nbe ready for its owner when he demanded it; that its owner should\r\nreceive all it earned less the necessary expense of holding it, and that\r\nthe amount it earned should be only such as those who borrowed it could\r\nfairly make it earn. This was invention No. 5: _The Bank_.\r\n\r\nAs the years followed one another, \"the bank\" became one of the most\r\nimportant of the people's institutions and grew in number and variety.\r\nThere came to be many different forms of banks. For instance, _national\r\nbanks_, which, under the control and regulation of the Government,\r\nbecame depositories for the circulation of the Government's money and\r\nwere privileged to lend money to individuals or corporations with or\r\nwithout collateral. Funds confided by the people to these national banks\r\nhad always to be ready for their owners. A second form was the\r\n_savings-bank_, which grew out of the requirements of small depositors\r\nand was governed by the laws of its community. The savings-bank used and\r\nsafeguarded money confided to it in small sums, and these amounts could\r\nbe withdrawn only by their owners in person, after an agreed term of\r\nnotice. The savings-bank was allowed to lend only on real estate or\r\ncertain other securities, the character of which was rigidly regulated\r\nby the law. In consequence, it could use its funds for long-time loans\r\nand mortgages, so it earned larger rates of interest than the national\r\nbanks. The _trust company_ was a third variation, coming somewhere\r\nbetween the national and the savings-bank, and was regulated, as was the\r\nlatter, by the laws of the community in which it existed. The trust\r\ncompany, too, received deposits from the people, but was allowed a\r\nbroader latitude in employing them. It was also authorized to engage in\r\ncertain other business--for example, to act as manager for a deceased\r\nperson's estate and even to buy and sell securities. Because of the\r\nextra-hazardous business in which it engaged and from which the other\r\ntwo institutions were legally debarred, the trust company earned and\r\npaid larger rates of interest to its depositors, and the men who\r\nhandled its funds were allowed to take for their own remuneration\r\nprofits in excess of those derived by the custodians of national and\r\nsavings-banks.\r\n\r\nAnother deficiency in the business structure growing out of the\r\nincreasing prosperity of the people was next provided for. When an\r\nenterprise became so large as to necessitate several owners for its\r\nconduct, the prescribing and defining of the relation of these owners to\r\neach other and to the common property became a task of increasing\r\ndifficulty. So the idea arose of welding the enterprise itself into a\r\nseparate entity which could do all the things the individual might, and\r\nyet exist apart from the individual and independent of his personal\r\ndealings and comings and goings. His ownership should be an undivided\r\ninterest in the whole represented by certificates of stock or bonds,\r\nwhich could pass from him to another without interfering with the\r\nenterprise. This was invention No. 6: _The Corporation_. The law then\r\nprovided regulations for the creation and conduct of these corporations\r\nwhich compelled them to keep their affairs in such shape that all could\r\nascertain of what each consisted.\r\n\r\nWhen these six organizations had been founded, the machinery for the\r\nconduct of the business of a civilized people was almost complete. But\r\nstill one other want developed: with the multiplication of the\r\ncorporation tokens of property, it became necessary that there should be\r\nsome place where the worth of these might be ascertained either by\r\npurchase, sale, or loan under the regulation of experts. So there was\r\ncreated a common market-place, to which came all those who had\r\ncorporation tokens of property to sell and those who desired to purchase\r\nthem; and the prices these brought were announced to the world and\r\nbecame the measure of the value of the institution they represented.\r\nRules for the regulation of the business of the market-place were\r\ngradually formulated, and invention No. 7--the _Stock Exchange_--came\r\ninto existence.\r\n\r\nWith this addition, the people's organism for safeguarding and\r\neconomically handling the funds of their labor to the best advantage of\r\nall concerned and without interfering with the rights and privileges of\r\nindividuals was fully equipped. Each separate institution had grown out\r\nof an actual necessity and had its own legal organic function, fully\r\nunderstood and defined. And there was no branch of human industry which\r\ncould not be safeguarded, handled, and perpetuated through this\r\norganism, nor could evil come from the existence of any one of these\r\nseven components. The robber, the thief, and the pirate, as defences\r\nagainst whom they had been erected, could not seize any of them or the\r\npeople's savings which they were created to safeguard, because the\r\nconstitution of each provided adequate penalties for such a seizure. As\r\nlong as the members of the organism performed their ordained functions\r\nthe fabric of the people's fortunes was safe from plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC \"JIMMY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that the class which is now the \"System\"--of which\r\nthe mighty robber of barbaric days was the prototype--began to cast\r\nenvious eyes at the accumulated earnings of a prosperous people locked\r\nup and safeguarded against depredation, while the owners (the public)\r\nrested easy in the conviction that they had fully protected themselves\r\nagainst the spoilsman. The \"System\" reasoned: \"If only a way could be\r\ndevised to win control of the seven institutions so that all the\r\nbenefits the people intend for themselves may revert to me and yet I be\r\nexempt from the punishment provided for those who attempt unfairly and\r\ndishonestly to secure such benefits, I can get a much easier and surer\r\npossession of the results of the labor of the people than I was wont to\r\nwhen I took them by might.\"\r\n\r\nA need defined is half relieved. Outside the treasure-house was the\r\nrobber enviously surveying its strong walls and iron doors, its locks\r\nand bolts, specially designed to defy the felonious intentions of such\r\nas he. How safely to win his way in and possess himself of the piled-up\r\ngold was his problem. And as he waited and watched, the lawyer, at his\r\nsolicitation, invented for him a magic \"jimmy\"--an instrument with which\r\nhe could not only break through the outside door, but as easily force\r\nhis way past the complex locks of the chambers inside. What was still\r\nbetter, this magic \"jimmy\" was also a license to enter upon and take\r\npossession of others' properties and use them for his own benefit. It\r\nconferred on its owner a legal privilege to steal. The robber was\r\nsatisfied. The \"jimmy\" which the lawyer had brought him was the\r\n\"trust.\"\r\n\r\nAll this sounds very hyperbolical and far-fetched, perhaps, but it is\r\nexactly what a \"trust\" is. The \"trust\" may also be defined as a master\r\nkey to the people's financial structure, which enables its owner to\r\nenter any or all of the separate institutions I have mentioned, and\r\ncombine any or all of them, without affecting their respective\r\norganisms, into a new organization which possesses the potencies and the\r\nprivileges of each, but is unhampered by the legal restrictions of any\r\none of them. Like electricity, the exact nature of a \"trust\" does not\r\nadmit of rigid definition, but it is a force which can be exerted only\r\nin conjunction with financial organisms, which it joins and yet\r\nreleases, adds power to, and exempts from consequences. Let us suppose\r\nthat two men are made into a \"trust\"--this human combine becomes at once\r\nfree from the bondage of matter and the senses, sees out of the back of\r\nits head and passes in and out through solid walls. It has all the\r\ncombined strength and more that the two men had and all their human\r\nprivileges and possessions, but it evades nature's laws as to\r\nindividuals, and the laws of man both as to individuals and other\r\nmaterial things.\r\n\r\nTo put the description in still another way, a \"trust\" is an institution\r\nwhich endows itself with the right to use any or all of the seven\r\ninstitutions of the people as the people use them, but so made that its\r\nuser derives from the institutions the benefits the people intended for\r\nthemselves, and yet is immune from the legal consequences of\r\nappropriating such benefits. Two or more men make a \"trust\" by\r\ncombining--acquiring the control of--an insurance company, a trust\r\ncompany, and a savings-bank. The new organization _is_ all of these\r\ninstitutions, performs the functions of all of them, yet can legally do\r\nwith their incomes, capital, and surpluses things which, from the very\r\nnature of each, none of the institutions is allowed to do--the new\r\norganization is all of these institutions until the law attempts to\r\nbring it to book; then it evades being any one of them. The trust\r\ncompany is empowered to lend money on speculative ventures which the\r\ninsurance company and savings-bank may not do, so the \"trust\" lends the\r\ninsurance company's vast accumulations and the savings-bank's hoard\r\nthrough the trust company with great profit or tremendous loss and\r\nenjoys immunity from the consequences which should follow such\r\ndisobedience of the law. Moreover, when the trust company shows a profit\r\nthe \"trust\" appropriates it, and when a tremendous loss is sustained the\r\ninsurance company or the savings-bank must bear it.\r\n\r\nAn illustration: A, B, and C form a \"trust.\" A and B are president and\r\ncontroller of a savings-bank and an insurance company respectively. They\r\norganize a trust company with $1,000,000 capital, of which the insurance\r\ncompany furnishes the majority; they then elect C president and\r\ncontroller of the trust company, and make him their associate or a\r\ndummy. The trust company receives $5,000,000 of the people's money on\r\ndeposit. The insurance company deposits $5,000,000 of its surplus funds,\r\nand the savings-bank $5,000,000 more. The trust company now has\r\n$15,000,000 of the people's savings in its control with which by law it\r\nis allowed to do certain things; but what it does with the $5,000,000 of\r\nthe savings-bank and the $5,000,000 of the insurance company the law\r\nspecifically says neither one of the institutions can do itself. The\r\n\"trust\" then purchases for $5,000,000 the stock of an industrial\r\ncorporation. It borrows the $5,000,000 and an additional $5,000,000,\r\nwhich represents its own first profit, from the trust company through\r\nirresponsible dummies, depositing the industrial stock as collateral.\r\nThe \"trust\" next causes the trust company to issue bonds for\r\n$15,000,000. These bonds are based upon and secured by nothing of worth\r\nbut the stock. The trust company offers these bonds for sale. The\r\ninsurance company buys $7,500,000 of the bonds, and the trust company,\r\nthrough dummies, the other $7,500,000. By the operation so far the\r\n\"trust\" shows a profit of $10,000,000. After making this profit and the\r\ntrue worth of the bonds becoming known, these decline back to the\r\noriginal worth of the stock upon which they are based, $5,000,000, and\r\nthere is the tremendous loss of $10,000,000 made. The trust company\r\n\"busts,\" and there is a loss to its depositors of $10,000,000. This loss\r\nis divided as follows: $3,333,000 to the savings-bank, $3,333,000 to the\r\ninsurance company, and $3,333,000 directly to the people, less the\r\nsmall amount which will be recovered from the stockholders. (These\r\nlosses will be affected in an unimportant way by the $1,000,000 original\r\ncapital.)\r\n\r\nIn this case the \"trust\" has done nothing for which those responsible\r\nfor it can be held civilly or criminally liable. Neither has the\r\ninsurance company, the savings-bank, nor the trust company, and yet, if\r\nthere had been no \"Trust\" and any one of the three institutions had made\r\nthe loss directly through its own actions, the officers of that\r\ninstitution would have been civilly and perhaps criminally held\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe utility and convenience of the \"trust\" having been demonstrated, it\r\nbecame a popular instrument for financiers desiring to accomplish all\r\nmanner of illegal purposes. Especially was it an apt tool for the\r\n\"System,\" which in the meantime was perfecting its control of the\r\npeople's institutions. The owners of railroads running through the same\r\nterritory, finding cumbersome and hampering the restrictions with which\r\nthe community they served had safeguarded its interests, formed\r\n\"trusts.\" Straightway there were valuable results--the combination was\r\nemancipated from the regulations which had bound its individual members;\r\ncompetition was eliminated and rates were raised.\r\n\r\nAs time went on new \"trust\" possibilities were discovered and other\r\ninstitutions linked up--corporations of all kinds, insurance companies\r\nand national banks and savings-banks, were brought together for the\r\nbenefit of the \"System\" and the detriment of the public. The end of the\r\ntrustification of the institutions of the nation is not yet, but the\r\npeople are to be shown a way by which the plundering process can be\r\nreversed and through which they can make their freedom complete and\r\nabsolute by the complete and absolute enslavement of the \"System\"\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHOW THE \"SYSTEM\" DOES BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow the various steps in the crimes of Amalgamated, my readers\r\nshould know how the securities of a corporation are manufactured, how\r\n\"put upon the market,\" how admitted to the Stock Exchange, how prices\r\nare made in the Stock Exchange, how fictitious and fraudulent quotations\r\nare created and disseminated, until the very shrewdest members of the\r\nStock Exchange cannot distinguish those which are real from the\r\nfictitious in cases outside their own manufacturing. Then there is an\r\nelaborate and ingenious procedure by which public opinion is moulded,\r\nthat is, by which people are made to believe that the prices at which\r\nthey buy and sell the stocks and securities are bona fide; and this is a\r\nprocedure as compact and as well understood by the \"System's\" votaries\r\nas are the methods of the bank-breaker or burglar--who sends his \"pals\"\r\nahead to \"pipe\" the lay of the land--by felony's votaries. When I have\r\nshown these things, about which little is known to-day by the public, my\r\nreaders will have no difficulty in comprehending what I shall lay before\r\nthem of the actual robberies in the case of Amalgamated and other\r\nnotorious enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe underlying principle of the several organisms through which the\r\ncommerce of the country is conducted is the protection at once of the\r\ninterests of the individuals composing them and of the public with which\r\nthey do business. Provided this principle is adhered to, no harm can be\r\nwrought to either. Most of the contemporaneous swindles through which\r\nthe people have been plundered were perpetrated through the agency of\r\ncorporations, and this organism has become a sort of synonym for corrupt\r\npractice. Yet the original corporation invention as I have described it\r\nwas devised to meet a real want of the people, and it has merely been\r\ndiverted from its proper use by the lawless votaries of the \"System.\"\r\nConsider the institution as we now understand it. Certain individuals\r\ndecide to conduct their business in railroads, mines, manufactories,\r\npatents, etc., in the form of a corporation and apply to the\r\ncommunity--the State Government--asking authorization to do so. They are\r\ncompelled first to conform to the rules and regulations laid down by the\r\nState for the control of corporations, which say in one form or other:\r\n\r\n\"We create you for the purpose of doing those things that are best for\r\nthe many, not the few, and if we knew you would use our authority to\r\noppress the many in the interest of the few we would not create you.\"\r\nThe fundamental privilege of incorporation is the legal authorization to\r\nissue paper titles of ownership to the business just incorporated. These\r\nare in the form of stocks and bonds. Whoever owns these paper titles\r\nshall possess the property and the business as the individuals did\r\nbefore they incorporated, and the law presumes that they shall manage\r\nand control that business, receive the benefits which come from it, and\r\nsuffer any loss arising from its conduct, and that all these benefits\r\nand responsibilities shall be as laid down in the law. It follows that\r\nno harm other than that the law expressly prescribes penalties to\r\nprevent can come to any one from corporations thus created, always\r\nprovided the laws are what they appear and what the people intended them\r\nto be, and that they are enforced as the people intended they should be.\r\n\r\nIt is most important to all concerned in a corporation that the paper\r\nownership shall represent the real value of the property on which it is\r\nbased, and no more. When the people exchange their savings for these\r\nauthorized paper tokens, they should be able to rest confident in the\r\nState's guarantee that they are worth what they purport.\r\n\r\nThere have probably been jailed in the United States during the past\r\ntwenty years thousands and thousands of American citizens whose\r\naggregate stealings do not amount to one-tenth the total taken from the\r\npeople by either the Amalgamated, the United States Steel, the American\r\nTobacco Company, or a score of other fraudulently organized or\r\nfraudulently conducted corporations.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of organizing corporations and issuing their\r\nstocks and bonds. Sometimes a company is organized to acquire a\r\nproperty; individuals and institutions set down their names to take and\r\npay for the shares or bonds. With the money thus obtained the property\r\nis purchased. _Or_ the individuals who own the property which is to be\r\nthe basis of the corporation exchange it for all or part of the stocks\r\nand bonds. In the latter event those original owners usually sell to the\r\npublic the tokens thus acquired.\r\n\r\nHonest men in forming a corporation make publicly known the character\r\nand worth of the properties or enterprises they are organizing, what\r\nthey have cost, what their profits are, and what may reasonably be\r\nexpected by investors. The tricksters and the \"System,\" with whom\r\nincorporation is generally but the first step in a conspiracy for\r\nplunder, surround the proceeding with an air of mystery and refuse\r\ninformation usually with: \"We do our business quietly and in silence,\r\nand those who do not like our ways may keep out of this scheme.\" Their\r\nwhole procedure is of that high and mighty order which impresses the\r\nordinary mortal with a sense of confidence in the independence of its\r\nusers and a conviction that their scheme must be so good that they do\r\nnot care whether they sell or not. This is just the effect it is\r\nintended to produce.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to lead the people toward the shambles. This is done by\r\n\"moulding public opinion,\" and for this interesting function the\r\n\"System\" and Wall Street have an equipment of magical potency. Public\r\nopinion is made through the daily press, through financial publications\r\nof various kinds, and through \"news bureaus.\" Every great daily has a\r\nfinancial editor and a corps of experts in finance who spend their days\r\non \"the Street\" cultivating the friendship of the financiers. At night\r\nthey are round the clubs and hotels where the brokers and promoters\r\ncongregate, debating the events of the day and organizing those of the\r\nmorrow. There are also the strictly financial papers--daily, weekly,\r\nand monthly--whose corps of editors and news gatherers live on \"the\r\nStreet,\" and know and care for nothing but finance. And lastly, there\r\nare the news bureaus, with runners out everywhere to gather in items of\r\nnews affecting stocks, Wall Street or finance. These are printed on\r\nsmall square sheets of paper, and delivered by an army of boys at brief\r\nintervals while the Stock Exchange is open at the offices of the\r\nbankers, brokers, insurance companies, and hotels; or the same matter is\r\ndisseminated by means of an automatic printing machine called a\r\nnews-ticker. For this service the offices pay the bureaus from $1 to $2\r\na day. News bureaus form an important cog in the machinery for making\r\nstock-markets, as it is through the news they furnish to the Stock\r\nExchange and to the offices where investors and speculators gather\r\ntogether that the big operators affect the market. A decision to buy,\r\nsell, or \"stand pat\" is often based on the _on dits_ of these printed\r\nslips.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward \"moulding public opinion\" is taken when the\r\n\"System's\" votaries send for the dishonest chief of a news bureau, a man\r\nusually up in every trick of the trade. I will later describe one of\r\nthem, a scoundrel so able and experienced that, to use the vernacular of\r\nthe gutter of \"the Street,\" he can give cards and spades to the\r\nfrenziedest of frenzied financiers. To this man the \"System's\" votary\r\nwill say something like this: \"We are going to work off blank millions\r\nof blank stock; it costs us thus and so, and we want to sell for so and\r\nso many millions.\" Nothing is kept back from this head panderer and\r\nprocurer, for it would be useless to attempt to deceive him, and, to\r\nquote his always picturesque language: \"Never send a sucker to fish for\r\nsuckers or he'll lose your bait, so spread out your bricks and I'll get\r\nthe 'gang' to polish up their gildings.\" After the quality and amount\r\nthe \"System\" intends to work off in exchange for the people's savings\r\nare explained, that part of the plunder which is to come to the head\r\nnews-bureau man is settled upon. The amount varies with the size and\r\nquality of the robbery to be perpetrated. In some cases as high as a\r\nmillion dollars in cash or stock or their equivalent has been paid to a\r\n\"moulder of opinion\" for simply so shaping up a game that the people\r\nmight be deceived into thinking one dollar of worth was four, six, or\r\neight dollars.\r\n\r\nThe head of the news bureau, having taken the contract to lay out and\r\ncarry through the deceptive part of the scheme by which the people are\r\nto be buncoed, now begins operations. First, bargains are made with\r\nconscienceless financial editors of the daily and weekly newspapers,\r\nwhereby for so much stock or for \"puts\" or \"calls\" or both,[17] they\r\nagree to insert in their paper's financial column whatever yarns are fed\r\nthem by the bureau man, regardless of their truth or falsehood. To\r\njustify the attention paid the subject by each editor, a certain amount\r\nof money is spent in advertising, in the newspaper that employs him, the\r\nmerits of the enterprise. The financial journals are dealt with about on\r\nthe same basis. In return for straight advertising or for \"puts\" or\r\n\"calls\" they agree to insert the manufactured news. The news-bureau man\r\nthen puts his entire staff to work inventing fairy tales of one kind or\r\nanother to excite the interest and attention of the people, and these\r\ntales must be so concocted that the public is drawn into believing that\r\nthe statements disseminated represent actual conditions. I shall, later,\r\ngive real instances of the working of this nefarious game of \"moulding\r\npublic opinion,\" and present it in the lime-light necessary for its\r\nappreciation. To show the extent to which this \"moulding\" process is\r\ncarried, I know in one instance of a high-priced financial scribe being\r\nsent to live in St. Petersburg for no other purpose than to send certain\r\n\"news items\" to a confederate located in Germany, who would get these\r\nitems to a reputable English banking-house through whom they were given\r\nout in London as news: the whole object of this complicated system being\r\nthat the news items might be sent back to New York without Wall Street\r\nsuspecting they were bogus.\r\n\r\nI must not be understood as meaning to say that all financial editors,\r\nnews gatherers, or news bureaus are engaged in this, one of the lowest\r\nforms of swindling, for such is not the case. _On the contrary, there\r\nare many of them whom no amount of money or influence could make waver\r\nin their allegiance to the truth and to honest dealings._ With some of\r\nthe others I hope to deal specifically later, and I shall not hesitate\r\nto set forth in detail certain transactions in which they have been\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] A \"put\" is the right to sell to a certain firm or individual shares of\r\nstock at a stated price for a stated period, and a \"call\" the right to buy\r\nunder the same conditions. The holder of the \"put\" or \"call\" is under no\r\nliability, as he can use the \"put\" as margin to buy stocks, or the \"call\"\r\nas margin to sell stocks, or he can hold them for the profit there may be\r\nin selling or buying the stock after it has declined or risen below or\r\nabove the price named in the \"puts\" or \"calls\" he holds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHOW WALL STREET'S MANIPULATIONS AFFECT THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the connection between the \"System\" and the minor financial\r\ninstitutions throughout the country which are owned and controlled by\r\ngroups of sturdy men who know not Wall Street and its frenzied votaries,\r\nand who are ignorant of \"made dollars\"? Let us see. We will take five\r\nnational banks in different parts of the country, each having a capital\r\nof $200,000 and deposits of $2,000,000. One is in the farming district\r\nof Kansas; another is in Louisiana in a cotton district; a third is in\r\nthe orange groves of California; in the mining district of Montana is a\r\nfourth; the fifth in the logging and lumber country of Maine. These\r\n$10,000,000 of deposits represent savings earned by the type of men who\r\nhave made America what it is, and who laugh when they read in their\r\nlocal papers: \"Panic in Wall Street; stocks shrink a billion dollars in\r\na day.\" \"Fools and their money are easily parted,\" they say, \"but Wall\r\nStreet gets none of our honestly earned money.\" Now the officers of\r\nthese five banks are honest men and they know nothing of the \"System,\"\r\nyet the day of the panic they each telegraph to their Illinois\r\ncorrespondent, the big Chicago bank, \"Loan our balance, $200,000, at\r\nbest rate.\" That day the Chicago bank with similar telegrams from\r\nforty-five other correspondents in various parts of the country, wires\r\nits New York correspondent, the big Wall Street bank, \"Loan our balance,\r\n$2,000,000, at best rates.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the great New York bank sends its brokers out upon \"the\r\nStreet\" to loan on inflated securities of one kind or another which its\r\nofficers, the votaries of the \"System,\" have purchased in immense\r\nquantities at slaughter prices the millions belonging to the Chicago\r\nbank and to other correspondents of its own in Cincinnati and Omaha and\r\nSt. Louis and other big cities. The decline is stayed, and then the\r\nworld learns that the panic is over and that the stocks, of which the\r\npeople have been \"shaken out\" to the extent of a billion dollars, have\r\nrecovered in a day $500,000,000 of it, and that probably in a few days\r\nmore will recover the other $500,000,000. Who has _recovered_ this vast\r\nsum? The people who had been \"shaken out\"? No, indeed! The votaries of\r\nthe \"System\" have made it--they and the frenzied financiers whose haunt\r\nis Wall Street, and whose harvest is in such wreckage.\r\n\r\nThe part that the five little banks innocently played in this terrific\r\nrobbery was unimportant. What is important is that it was the funds of\r\ntheir depositors and others like them which the \"System\" used to turn\r\nthe Stock Market and make an immense profit out of the recovery of\r\nvalues. It is true the banks received but two and one-half or three per\r\ncent. for the use of their balances, and their officers would scorn the\r\nsuggestion that they had put any of their money in jeopardy in a Wall\r\nStreet gamble. But what I have outlined happened, and has happened many\r\na time before and since, and goes to prove my assertion that every\r\nfinancial institution which is taking the money of the people for the\r\nostensible purpose of safeguarding it or putting it to use for them, is\r\na part of the machinery for the plundering of the people.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, every dollar taken by the \"System\" through Wall\r\nStreet's manipulation of stocks directly affects every man, woman, and\r\nchild in the United States. Let us, for example, see how a stock slump\r\nin New York affects the owner of a small life-insurance policy in\r\nWyoming. The shares of the American and English ocean steamship\r\ncompanies were bought up by the \"System\" at double their worth and\r\nconverted into a \"trust.\" New stocks and bonds to a number of times\r\ntheir value were issued and sold to the public. The great insurance\r\ncompanies bought many millions worth of these securities, using for the\r\npurpose the money they had collected from the policy-holders, a dollar\r\nat a time. This \"investment,\" at the moment it was made, actually\r\nrepresented a loss to the purchasing insurance companies of millions of\r\nmoney, for millions more than the property was worth or could possibly\r\nbe made worth had gone to the people who formerly owned the steamship\r\nproperties, and many millions more to the \"System\" as its share of the\r\nswag. And it should be remembered that the men who organized the\r\nsteamship trust were the men who invested the insurance company's money\r\nin its securities.\r\n\r\nThe policy-holder in Wyoming knows about the steamship trust and about\r\nthe terrible loss sustained by those who invested in its securities. He\r\ndoes not realize, however, that his insurance company has been buying\r\nsuch poor stuff, for he is persuaded it is a great and noble\r\ninstitution, and far above Wall Street and its rash gamblers. Even when\r\nhe and his kind find their yearly dividends on their policies growing\r\nless and less and their premiums rising \"because of the tremendous\r\nincrease in the expense of doing business,\" they do not dream of\r\nconnecting these misfortunes with the \"System's\" trustifications of\r\ninflated securities; nor do they associate them with the glowing\r\naccounts of the half-million-dollar seaside palace built by the\r\ninsurance company's officer who entered the employ of the institution a\r\nfew years before, with his salary for his fortune, and who is now\r\npointed to as an example of thrift, being worth from ten to fifteen\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nECONOMICS OF COPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nA thorough familiarity with the facts and conditions set forth in the\r\npreceding chapters will help my readers to an understanding of the\r\nseries of complicated transactions through which the snaky course of\r\nAmalgamated must be pursued. Its flotation was the most tremendous and\r\npublic ever even attempted, much less successfully carried out, and in\r\nits market career the full resources of stock jugglery were exercised on\r\nits behalf. The crimes of Amalgamated are to the delinquencies of Bay\r\nState Gas as the screaming of eagles to the chirping of crickets. From\r\nits birth this great enterprise went hand-in-hand with fraud and\r\nfinancial dishonor, and the facts I shall proceed to reveal are so\r\nformidable in their indictment as to startle even those calloused to the\r\ntrickery of modern stock deals.\r\n\r\nAn armistice followed that last desperate battle of the gas fight in the\r\nDelaware court-house, and gave me time to turn my whole attention to the\r\nplans I had long been maturing in my mind in connection with quite\r\nanother project--\"Coppers.\"\r\n\r\nFor sixty years past Boston had been the home of the copper industry.\r\nFrom it great fortunes had been derived, and there was in course of\r\ndevelopment a copper aristocracy which threatened the supremacy of the\r\nEast India aristocracy that had so long lorded it in Boston society.\r\nIndeed, so far had the rival contingents progressed that there was a\r\nserious searching of the pretensions of any new-comer whose origin had\r\nto do with other enterprises. \"Coppers\" were respectable, were genteel,\r\nand, above all, were not \"trade,\" for the average old-time Bostonian\r\naffects the Anglo-Saxon contempt for the traffickings of retail\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those in the outer darkness, to whom the ways of\r\nBoston are strange, it may be explained that the East India trade goes\r\nelsewhere under other less euphonious names, and consisted in the\r\nswapping of New England rum, made from molasses, water, and other\r\nthings, for human cotton-pickers. It was a most profitable industry,\r\nwith a spice of adventure to it, and in which at the time it flourished\r\na gentleman might honorably engage. It may be said that with the\r\nparadoxical conscientiousness characteristic of the Puritan mind, the\r\nfirst outcry against the personal ownership of human chattels was voiced\r\nby New England, and her leading citizens generously devoted the incomes\r\nof the fortunes their forefathers had amassed in the slave traffic to\r\nreleasing their colored fellow-creatures from bondage. That, however, is\r\nstill another story.\r\n\r\nTo return to \"Coppers.\" In my young days in \"the Street\" in the early\r\n'70s, the first task I remember performing was making deliveries of\r\ncopper stocks traded in by \"the house\" which was entitled to my\r\ntwelve-year-old services in return for the three large dollars which I\r\nreceived each Saturday with far more honest pride than any three\r\nmillions I have since handled. As I grew up I watched Calumet and Hecla\r\nadvance from a dollar to 450 (it afterward sold at 900) because of its\r\nreal worth, and imbibed the conviction, which all true Bostonians\r\nentertain, that money acquired through copper is at least 33 per cent.\r\nbetter than money from any other source. I sympathized with the State\r\nStreet code which declares, or should: \"Gold can be found in a day by\r\nany one with eyes, silver in a week by any one with hands, and money in\r\na year by any one with sense enough to save it, but no man gets into\r\ncopper without capital, fortitude, patience, and brains.\" As a matter of\r\nfact, it requires, even to-day, with all of to-day's facilities and\r\nrush, $5,000,000 in money and five years of spending it after a copper\r\ndeposit has been found before it can be made to yield returns. Is it\r\nsurprising that a project requiring so much money for so long a time\r\nshould appeal to Boston's regard for endurance, expensiveness, and\r\nexclusiveness? Could there be found an enterprise better calculated to\r\ndiscourage the upstart?\r\n\r\nMy daily round of errands led me from broker to broker and from bank to\r\nbank, and always I heard talk of copper. It is not remarkable that my\r\nyouthful mind became impressed with the profound importance of the metal\r\nand all pertaining to it. I picked up a great deal of information on the\r\nsubject, which I fortified later with a careful study of copper the\r\nmetal, copper the mine, and copper the investment. As I mulled over the\r\nimmense returns obtained from their ventures by the men I knew had their\r\nmoney in copper, it struck me as extraordinary that this industry should\r\nbe so much more profitable than others. Here was a great staple, a\r\nnecessity of the people, which had been in use since men began to sit\r\nup, and would be needed until Father Time smashed his glass, that\r\nreturned 100 per cent. gross profit on the business done in it, while\r\nthe business done in any other staple did not return, gross, over ten to\r\neighteen per cent.; which gross profit gave to the capital invested in\r\ncopper a net profit of sixteen to twenty-five per cent., while that\r\ninvested in the other staples returned a net profit of only three and\r\nthree-fourths to four and one-fourth per cent.[18] The value of money\r\nhad decreased with the world's development; the cost of the great\r\ncommodities of life had all come down with the decline in interest--all\r\nbut copper, which kept its old places throughout all the changes that\r\nhad occurred in the relations of capital to labor and business. I\r\nrealized that copper, in that year, would afford a gross profit of 100\r\ncents on each $2 worth produced; that this great gross profit was\r\nlegitimate, was not brought about through unfair restrictions or forced\r\ncombination, or evasion of the country's laws, but was wholly natural,\r\nbeing founded on the fact that the supply was so limited that the demand\r\nprevented the price dropping below a certain figure, and that this under\r\nordinary circumstances represented at least 100 per cent. of gross\r\nprofit to the producer after he had paid for labor and material the\r\nhighest ruling prices.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of the main facts about copper can be found than\r\nthe condition of the industry to-day, in 1905. The metal is now fifteen\r\nand a half cents per pound, and the consumption so great that the price\r\nstill advances, yet if through an agreement among the producing mines\r\nthis sales-rate should be dropped twenty-five per cent., it would so\r\nincrease consumption as to force back the price to a point that would\r\nagain discourage consumption; and yet in the old mines the cost of\r\nproducing the metal sold at fifteen and a half is but six to seven and a\r\nhalf cents, in some even lower.\r\n\r\nCompare these conditions with those existing in the steel industry.\r\nTherein unlawful combinations and unnatural restrictions are essential\r\nif those engaged would show a gross profit of even fifteen per cent. on\r\ntheir gross output. If more than fair or going returns are earned, then\r\nnew capital flows into competition and the surplus again shrinks to an\r\nuninviting point. The same is true in wheat, corn, and cotton--big\r\nprices invite fresh investments and the planting of broader acreage.\r\nHence the sorry spectacle of the cotton planter who, in 1905, will\r\nreceive no more for his twenty per cent. increased crop, coming from\r\nover two millions increased acreage planted last year, than for his\r\nsmaller one of the year before.\r\n\r\nThat my readers may quickly, and once for all, grasp the point I wish to\r\nmake, I will illustrate:\r\n\r\nThe Steel trust in 1904 did a gross business of $432,000,000, upon which\r\nthey made a profit of $71,400,000, and yet this vast amount was only\r\nfive per cent. upon the trust's inflated capital of $1,400,000,000 odd;\r\nand as the \"System,\" in regulating the capitalization, arranged that the\r\npreferred stock (and bonds), which represented the \"System's\" profit,\r\nshould receive seven per cent., there was not a dollar in dividends for\r\nthe $520,000,000 of common stock which had been sold to the people for,\r\nin round figures, $300,000,000.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Calumet & Hecla Copper Company produced and sold\r\nover $10,000,000 worth of copper, upon which it earned, net, over\r\n$5,000,000, which enabled it to pay to the people who had invested in\r\nits 100,000 shares of stock (par value, $25), 160 per cent., or a total\r\nof $4,000,000, and, at the same time, carry an enormous amount to its\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial world copper occupies an impregnable position. To\r\ncompete, it is first necessary to find a copper deposit; then to lock up\r\na vast sum of money for a long term of years before returns begin to\r\naccrue. And new copper deposits are as rare and few and far between as\r\nLincolns and Roosevelts in politics or Grants and Lees in war. In the\r\nlast eight years, or since the metal has been prominently before the\r\nworld of capital, but two great producers of copper have been\r\ncreated--the Copper Range at Lake Superior, Michigan, and the Greene\r\nConsolidated in Mexico--and these two mines have only, at the end of six\r\nyears, after an immense expenditure of millions (Copper Range, with a\r\ncapital of $38,500,000, 385,000 shares, par $100, which sold in the open\r\nmarket a few years ago at $6, now selling at $75, and Greene\r\nConsolidated, with a capital of $8,650,000, 865,000 shares, par $10, now\r\nselling in the open market at $25), reached the point of profitable\r\nproduction. Their combined output, while reaching the (for young mines)\r\nunprecedented amount of one hundred and odd million pounds of metal per\r\nannum, constitutes but a fraction of that which Mother Earth has given\r\nup during the period of their development, namely, 2,500,000,000 pounds,\r\nall of which has been disposed of and cannot again be used to satisfy a\r\nravenous consumption.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, then, a curious anomaly that, while capital was chasing\r\ninvestments which promised but four per cent., it eschewed copper which\r\nyielded from sixteen to twenty-five per cent., and my investigations\r\ntold me that a producing copper-mine is the surest business venture a\r\nman engages in, for, by the time it begins to produce profitably, it\r\nmust be so far developed that its owners are certain of ore to work on\r\nfor decades ahead. A good copper-mine is really a safe-deposit vault of\r\nstored-up dividends, which cannot be stolen nor destroyed by fire,\r\nflood, or famine. Calumet & Hecla, for instance, though it cost its\r\nfirst owners but a dollar a share, has paid out $87,000,000, or $870 per\r\nshare, or 3,480 per cent. on its par value of $25, and while it has been\r\npaying dividends over thirty-five years, it paid last year $40 per\r\nshare, and has more in sight than it has yet paid. And Copper Range,\r\nthough but six years old, will be producing soon as much as Calumet &\r\nHecla, and has now in sight ore to keep it going fifty or sixty years.\r\n\r\nHaving pieced together all the facts and circumstances in this\r\nconnection, I was sure that I had grasped a principle of great\r\ncommercial value, and I set about finding a cause why the world of\r\ncapital should for so long have overlooked the tremendous potentialities\r\nof this industry. I found the cause in Boston herself, in the\r\ncharacteristics of the city, which was head-quarters for copper, and\r\nwhich had grown in financial power with the revenues her mines earned\r\nfor her investors. Boston controlled and managed the copper industry,\r\nand had since the days when copper-mining was a hazardous pursuit, in\r\nwhich only bold and speculative souls dared engage. In the early days\r\nthe canny Bostonian demanded for the honorable dollar his parent had\r\nearned--exchanging five-cent rum for human beings worth $1,000\r\napiece--at least twenty per cent. interest, and having acquired this\r\nhabit, it became a principle, and such principles as these are clung to\r\nin Boston with the zeal of a miser for his hoard or of a martyr to his\r\nfaith. Looking back over the years, I still recall with chagrin the\r\nquiescent hilarity of the scion of a Back Bay family whose good father\r\nhad been one of the most successful and most brutal of all the \"East\r\nIndia traders,\" when I suggested to him that he was fortunate in\r\nobtaining twenty per cent. on some copper ventures about which he was\r\ngrumbling. (My readers must not confuse a Boston grumble with the\r\nordinary ejaculations of discontent indulged in by the inhabitants of\r\nother portions of the world remote from the Hub of the Universe. A\r\nBoston grumble consists of an upward movement of the eyebrow, a slight\r\ntwitch of the mustache and a murmur cross-bred from \"Deuce take it!\" and\r\n\"Scoundrelly!\") \"Young man,\" he said, \"my father said that such a\r\nhazardous venture as copper should return at least thirty per cent. to\r\nbe safe, and I feel if I receive but twenty per cent. that something is\r\nradically and unpardonably wrong with the management of the mine.\" I did\r\nnot pursue the argument, for I knew he inherited with his fortune a line\r\nof Boston reasoning, and I remembered once having watched a country boy\r\nput his tongue on a frosty iron door-knob. I knew better than to invoke\r\nagain that wintry Boston smile, which in a Western or Southern community\r\nwould be used to _frappé_ mint-juleps or cold-storage hogs with.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of the attitude of the shrewd New York investor\r\nto \"Copper\" can possibly be given than to detail my first interview with\r\nH. H. Rogers and William Rockefeller on the subject. To-day Mr. Rogers\r\nis known throughout the world as the leading figure of the copper\r\nworld--the copper Czar, so to speak; yet it was only nine years ago when\r\nI said to him at the end of a gas-talk:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, would Mr. Rockefeller and yourself look into Copper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Copper?\" said he in an amused way, \"copper? What kind of copper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, copper such as we know in Boston--copper the metal, copper the\r\nindustry, copper stocks.\"\r\n\r\nHe burst into one of his jolly laughs. \"Look into it? Why, I don't know\r\na thing about copper other than that we had old copper kettles when I\r\nwas a boy which were used to fry doughnuts in, but I suppose my plumbers\r\nwould look at anything you wanted, for I remember I get big bills for\r\ncopper tanks at the house.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] For those unacquainted with such business terms as \"gross\" or \"net\"\r\nprofit: Gross profit on business done is that first profit which remains\r\nafter deducting the first cost of producing the goods--in this case copper,\r\nthe metal; and from this gross profit must be deducted other expenses, such\r\nas unusual development expenses, the expense of running the executive\r\ndepartments, interest, etc. This leaves the net profit which is available\r\nfor dividends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMY PLAN FOR \"COPPERS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan I had so carefully formulated in connection with \"Coppers\" was\r\nsimple in application yet vast in scope. It was to buy up all the good\r\nproducing mines at their market price, or double if necessary, to\r\norganize them into a new corporation and offer its stock to the public\r\nat a capitalization of double the original cost. By advertising the\r\nexceptional merits of the copper industry and the financial power of the\r\nmen who were backing it, the public would become educated to a knowledge\r\nof the values of \"Coppers.\" Under this education the world of capital\r\nwould invest in copper shares until the price had advanced, because of\r\nso much capital seeking this form of investment, to a point where the\r\nnet return was brought down to the going rate of, say, four per cent.\r\nThis would mean that the old going prices of good producing Boston\r\ncopper-mines would advance 100 to 200 per cent., which in turn meant\r\nthat those who risked their money in the first venture (which I figured\r\nwould require $100,000,000) would make $100,000,000 to $200,000,000,\r\nwhile at the same time the public would make $200,000,000 to\r\n$400,000,000. This seems like an \"Aladdin-lamp\" story when it is told,\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, prices afterward did advance in this ratio,\r\nand 100 and 200 per cent. beyond, and many of them, notwithstanding the\r\ntremendous drops that have taken place since, still show from 200 to 300\r\nper cent. advance over the prices then in vogue. _Never in all the\r\nhistory of business was there afforded capitalists so fair an\r\nopportunity to make honestly and legitimately so vast a sum of money and\r\nat the same time to do so much for the people. Nor was there a more\r\nhonorable undertaking nor one which a man could be more justly proud of\r\ncarrying to success._\r\n\r\nAs time went on, this big enterprise was more and more in my thoughts,\r\nand I tested it in every way I knew, going over in my mind and trying\r\nout each successive step and link until I was certain the whole\r\nstructure was unassailable. Then it became my purpose in life to launch\r\nthe venture. The difficulties of the task were never for a moment\r\noverlooked, for I well knew that much money would be required, but with\r\nstrong backing success was sure, and such a success was tremendously\r\nworth attaining. Next to putting in force my financial invention which\r\nwould remedy the evils of the \"System,\" this great copper project seemed\r\nthe thing--the dollar thing--best worth doing in all the world. It was\r\nto execute this project that I allied myself with the \"Standard Oil\"\r\nparty, for with their money and backing I knew I could carry through my\r\nplans on the lines I had so carefully mapped out.\r\n\r\nThe chief indictment my critics brought against me when my series of\r\narticles appeared in _Everybody's Magazine_ was that I had turned\r\n\"State's evidence.\" Having been \"in with\" \"Standard Oil\" in their\r\nrobberies of the public, it was not until we disagreed and \"split\" that\r\nI thought of taking the public into my confidence. The truth is, my\r\nrelation with \"Standard Oil\" was different from that any other man ever\r\nhad with that mysterious and reticent institution, and throughout the\r\ncopper crusade I insistently blurted out our plans and purposes through\r\nevery channel of publicity I could command. At no time was there the\r\nslightest secrecy. From the very first day of the campaign I told the\r\nstory as I tell it here, and I told it from the housetops by newspaper\r\ninterviews and advertisements, market letters and circulars frankly and\r\nfreely explaining what I was about. The absolute truth of the foregoing\r\nis easily proved through existing records, for the press of the country\r\ncontains an almost continuous story, beginning in 1896 and running up to\r\ndate, wherein I have openly and fairly told what I knew about \"Coppers\"\r\nand detailed the progress of our plans. Time and again, during this\r\nperiod, financial writers commented on my frankness, quoting brokers\r\nand bankers to the effect that \"Lawson will surely have his head dropped\r\ninto the 'Standard Oil' basket if he keeps telling people all he knows\r\nin this fashion.\" For the complete realization of my project the\r\npublic's interest was essential. The creation of the vast business\r\nstructure that I had designed required the participation of the great\r\nmass of the people, and I was determined that no subservience to the\r\nselfish ends of my associates should swerve me from my plan. I saw the\r\nenterprise whole; saw that there was great profit for all concerned, for\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" for myself, and for the public; but if the public were\r\nnot taken care of or were discouraged from participation, then my\r\ninstitution would surely be only another combination of capitalists and\r\nI should fail in my ambition.\r\n\r\nThis is why I so persistently kept in the open throughout my \"Copper\"\r\ncampaign. I fully realized how anomalous my position was and how far I\r\nhad departed from \"Standard Oil\" precedents; but my thought was to\r\nprotect the integrity of my enterprise, and the best way to do this was\r\nto have the people partners in its conception and development. To be\r\nperfectly frank, the prospect of millions of profit counted for less in\r\nmy calculations than the honor and prestige I foresaw in the success of\r\nmy copper structure. As proof of this, witness how I voluntarily gave\r\nback the millions I had secured, to make good. To create a great\r\ninstitution, to erect a new and absolutely staple investment, and in\r\ndoing so to make millions for one's partners, one's self, and the\r\npublic, would be to live not in vain. The knowledge of my attitude will\r\nperhaps help my readers to comprehend the enthusiasm with which I\r\nentered into my \"Copper\" crusade; help them to understand how strongly I\r\nresisted, and how deeply resented, the perversion of my fair structure\r\ninto a pitfall for those I had expected to benefit. My indignation\r\nagainst the \"System\" is that which any honest man would feel against\r\nruffians who had used his best ideas and his most generous feelings to\r\nlure innocent and unoffending people into some den of vice and infamy.\r\nIf I have not troubled to correct the misstatements of detractors who,\r\nin an attempt to discredit my facts, have tried to pillory me as a\r\ntraitor, it is because I knew that when my complete story reached the\r\npublic it would make plain how and what I had been doing. The succeeding\r\nchapters of this narrative will yield unimpeachable evidence that all my\r\ndealing in \"Coppers\" as an associate of \"Standard Oil\" were open and as\r\nmuch in the interests of the people as it was possible to have them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF \"COPPERS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActive upon the Boston market during my Bay State Gas operations were\r\ntwo copper-mining companies--the Butte & Boston and the Boston &\r\nMontana. Their properties were in Montana and both were large producers\r\nof the metal, that is, they were old and equipped mines. These two\r\norganizations form to-day the most valuable part of the Amalgamated\r\nCopper Company--in fact, more than three-quarters of all the real worth\r\nowned by that corporation.\r\n\r\nButte & Boston and Boston & Montana were essentially Boston\r\ninstitutions, and were both officered and directed by the same set of\r\nmen. It had come to my knowledge, in the course of my stock business,\r\nthat there had been bought for the Butte & Boston, with its money, some\r\nvery valuable mines; instead of transferring these to that corporation,\r\nhowever, its directors at the last minute had turned the titles over to\r\nthe Boston & Montana. It is only fair to these men to say that up to the\r\npresent this alleged fact has not been proven, although set forth in\r\ncases still pending in the courts. This curious proceeding was part of a\r\nplot the subsequent steps in which would be to run Butte & Boston\r\nthrough the bankruptcy mill, and, by placing it in the hands of a\r\nreceiver, to drop the stock to a nominal figure, at which it might all\r\nbe gathered in from the public. I verified my information sufficiently\r\nto decide to act, and swung the red danger-signal in a public statement\r\ntelling the stockholders and people in general of the coming move. At\r\nonce there arose a chorus of denials and recriminations from the\r\nmanagement, and the cry, \"He's short of the stock and is working a fake\r\nto scare us into throwing over our holdings that he may buy them,\" from\r\nthe Stock Exchange, stockholders, and the hireling moulders of opinions,\r\nthe \"News Bureaus.\"\r\n\r\nThe rôle of Cassandra is not more popular to-day than it was in ancient\r\nTroy. The swinger of the red danger-signal is seldom heeded, and is\r\ninvariably suspected of interested motives by the human moths circling\r\nround the flickering flames of frenzied finance. When I gave my warning,\r\nButte & Boston was selling between 25 and 30. In accordance with their\r\nplan the insiders began to sell, and soon the price began to slide\r\ndownward, for the great majority of the stock was held by the people.\r\nThere was a halt when the denials of the management were heard, but only\r\nfor a moment. The decline continued, growing swifter as it got lower\r\nuntil the stock struck $2 per share. At this stage, while the stock was\r\non the way to $2, just as I had predicted, the property was cleverly\r\nslid into a receiver's hands by the very men who had so indignantly\r\ndenied my statement that such would be their action. An assessment of\r\n$10 per share was next levied, and those who held on, hoping against\r\nhope, began to throw over their holdings for what they would\r\nbring--which was around a dollar.\r\n\r\nSo far the scheme had slipped smoothly along the single-rail track\r\nconstructed for it by those in the deal, and just as my information had\r\nled me to expect. At this juncture, however, the train struck an open\r\nswitch, and with a painful jolt for the conductor and the engineers it\r\nslid out on a siding--it was my siding. From the time the stock struck\r\n$2 a mysterious purchaser took in all that was offered, and when it\r\nstruck bottom he was still buying. Suddenly the schemers \"tumbled\" that\r\nthe plums they were shaking off the tree were dropping into some other\r\nbag than their own, and they started into competition for the coveted\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nNext day, and for several days afterward, there were strenuous doings in\r\nButte & Boston on the Boston Stock Exchange. The trading was heavy and\r\nthe price pushed up from the bottom to 6-1/2. Soon, however, it was\r\nslammed to 2-3/4, then back to 6 again, down to 3-1/4, back to 5-3/4,\r\nand so on, until the middle of the fourth day, when the rival News\r\nBureau to the \"System's\" favorite opinion-moulder sprang the following\r\nnotice set forth on a double-leaded sheet:\r\n\r\n     \"We have just solved the Butte & Boston conundrum. The\r\n     enormous blocks of stock purchased during the past few days\r\n     have come in for transfer, and the management now know who\r\n     owns the bag into which all the stock they have for months\r\n     been planning to acquire dropped. We have unmistakable\r\n     evidence that the bag belonged to Lawson, and that he now is\r\n     in control of the Butte & Boston Company. A hasty\r\n     investigation amongst the leading floor brokers which we\r\n     have just made brings out a consensus of opinion that there\r\n     will now be music in Coppers.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement was calculated to interest a good many persons, and I\r\nwas the target of a thousand inquiries. In answer to the innumerable\r\ncalls for a denial or confirmation of the statement, I issued the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     'Tis true. 'Tis my bag, and there are 46,000 shares in it.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following morning that I realized what a rarely\r\npresumptuous thing I had done. I had invaded a valuable preserve. I had\r\ncoarsely \"butted into\" a private copper domain without a by-your-leave\r\nto the natives who thought it belonged to them. I was an interloper, an\r\nintruder, an upstart. The prevailing opinion seemed to be that it now\r\ndevolved on me to present what I had purchased to those who had been a\r\nbit late in getting to the bargain-counter, or that I should, at least,\r\nturn it over to the conscience fund of the Stock Exchange. The copper\r\nmarket reflected the indignation of the baffled schemers. It entered for\r\nonce into an open competition with Donnybrook Fair, and to judge by the\r\naction and feeling developed in both individual and corporation classes,\r\nthe Hub had Donnybrook jigged to a wind-up. In my various contests with\r\nthe \"System\" I had accumulated a certain hardihood which now stood me in\r\ngood stead. I had learned before this that breaking into a secluded\r\ntreasure-trove is about as pleasant as taking the lining out of a steel\r\nfurnace with the metal sizzling and the blower on.\r\n\r\nI stood to my guns for the time being and then charged into the ranks\r\nof the enemy. I issued the following statement:\r\n\r\n     TO MY FELLOW-BROKERS AND THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\n     I have stumbled on the fact that the stock--capital 200,000\r\n     shares--of the Butte & Boston Copper Mining Company is a\r\n     nugget. I bought about 46,000 shares of it at an average of\r\n     something over 2-1/4, or, with the assessment paid, 12-1/4\r\n     per share. I am going to hold it until I get over 50 for it.\r\n     Barring accidents, I shall get it.\r\n\r\n     I advise--strongly and unqualifiedly advise--all my friends\r\n     and the public to load up with it at anything under that\r\n     price. My friends and the public know whether or not I mean\r\n     a thing when I say it. I pledge them that I not only mean\r\n     this but that I shall fight it out, and shall not sell until\r\n     there is an active and legitimate market for not only my\r\n     stock, but for what they buy, at over $50 per share. All\r\n     intending purchasers must bear in mind this is not a sure\r\n     thing, for the men who are opposing, and will oppose me, are\r\n     not conducting their operations from a graveyard, but are as\r\n     lively and aggressive as Bengal tigers at raw-meat time; but\r\n     they may rest easy in the knowledge that barring tripping\r\n     over stumps or into bogs, I'll give whoever buy a run for\r\n     their investments.\r\n\r\n     Buy and watch Butte all the time, and, above all, pay no\r\n     attention to what the fake \"News Bureau\" says.\r\n\r\nThis was the formal declaration of war. State and Wall streets, familiar\r\nwith my style of fighting, at once lined up and took sides. The papers\r\nentered the controversy. According to what one read, Butte & Boston was\r\neither the greatest mine in the world or a hole in the ground. Feeling\r\nintensified; Geneva and Queensberry conventions were forgotten; it\r\nbecame a go-as-you-please scramble; mud batteries filled the air with\r\nliquid dirt, and both sides used Gatling guns to fire off their libels.\r\nIt was altogether a lusty and vociferous contest, which meant\r\ndestruction and death for the lame, the halt, and the slow-footed who\r\ngot between the fighting lines. I was naturally the chief mark for the\r\nenemy, and was deluged with vilification. In the Bay State campaign I\r\nhad learned the personal cost of antagonizing the \"System\"; the copper\r\nmagnates showed me that they had terrors at command which might make\r\neven \"Standard Oil\" jealous. In those days I don't believe my bank\r\naccount varied thirty-five cents without the news being passed around\r\nbefore the ink on the bank-book was dry, and my family, down to my\r\nten-year-old, received daily or weekly through the mails pictorial\r\nrepresentations of their parent being hustled along to the realms where\r\nsulphur is the standard of all values. Here is a sample of my usual\r\nbreakfast-table reading:\r\n\r\n     C. W. Barron, the proprietor of the \"Boston News Bureau,\"\r\n     feels it his duty to inform his readers, the banks and\r\n     bankers and brokers and representative investors of New\r\n     England, that that faking ass of State Street, that knave of\r\n     knaves, Tom Lawson, is braying again, and such\r\n     braying!--\"Butte is to sell at 50, and going to be worth\r\n     50.\" It would be such a joke that this conservative paper\r\n     would be only too happy to circulate this scoundrel's\r\n     vaporings, if it were not for the sad part of such schemer's\r\n     work--if it were not that the poor and ignorant unfortunates\r\n     who are unacquainted with this knave, may buy Butte because\r\n     of his advertised lies at $14 or $15 a share and thereby be\r\n     robbed of what they can ill afford to lose. There is no more\r\n     chance of Butte & Boston stock selling at $50, or even $25,\r\n     than there is of Tom Lawson telling the truth; and this\r\n     paper does not hesitate to say that if Butte stock ever does\r\n     sell at 50, we will upon that day close up our office and\r\n     forever leave Boston and our lucrative business of guarding\r\n     investors against such knaves as this lying thief; for any\r\n     man who would do what he is doing to fleece investors is a\r\n     thief and should wear stripes, and it is surprising to us he\r\n     has so long escaped.\r\n\r\nIt was not so long after the above appeared that Butte & Boston stock\r\nwas selling at $130 per share, and that the same Mr. Barron was using\r\nhis own and his \"News Bureau's\" best efforts to induce the people whose\r\nButte showed them over $115 a share profit to exchange it for\r\nAmalgamated. At this latter time he was acting for \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that this same Butte & Boston stock, which I was such a\r\nknave to advise the people to buy at twelve and fifteen, sells to-day in\r\nthe form of a share of Amalgamated, for which it was exchanged at\r\nseventy-five to eighty-dollars, not cents.\r\n\r\nMy chief weapon in this Butte & Boston fight was publicity. Every\r\nmorning while the battle waxed hottest I had huge, striking\r\nadvertisements in the papers urging the public to buy and to hold on to\r\nwhat they had bought. My opponents responded in kind, and being\r\nintrenched in the management, told such alarming stories of the mine\r\nthat it was often as much as I could do to prevent my followers from\r\nbeing scared into throwing over their holdings. The tremendous expense\r\nof this mode of warfare, together with the immense sums my market\r\noperations required, kept me hustling, and there were times when things\r\nlooked distinctly blue. However, the value of victory is measured by the\r\nfierceness of the tussle, and far be it from me to complain of my\r\nopponents' energy. There was good fighting over Butte & Boston.\r\n\r\nThe more deeply I became interested in this struggle and the more\r\nfamiliar I grew with \"Coppers,\" the more advantageous and profitable\r\nseemed the prospects of such a consolidation of copper properties as I\r\nhad in mind. The large holdings of Butte & Boston I had accumulated in\r\nthe battle gave me a practical basis for my structure, for I could now\r\nafford to do all my own part of the work of organization for what I\r\nwould eventually make when the consolidation was brought about, and I\r\ncould get for my shares what I knew they were worth. It was at this\r\nstage I broached the subject of \"Coppers\" to Mr. Rogers, and discovered\r\nto my surprise that he knew nothing about it or its possibilities,\r\nnotwithstanding that \"Standard Oil\" has a department for the sole\r\npurpose of keeping the \"System\" posted about what the world is doing in\r\nvarious directions. Indeed, both he and Mr. Rockefeller laughed when I\r\ninformed them that we had been trading in copper stocks in Boston long\r\nbefore the Standard Oil Company received its birth certificate.\r\n\r\nBefore I could get down to business on the subject I had to take\r\nadvantage of five gas-talks, offering at each a few interesting and\r\nstriking facts about the metal. One day Mr. Rogers said to me, laughing\r\npleasantly: \"Lawson, we're beginning to look for all your talks to taper\r\noff with, 'I wish I could get you to listen to Coppers!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you then?\" I said. \"It's the biggest opportunity in the world\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" replied Mr. Rogers. \"If you will put\r\nthrough for us right away thus and so\" (naming quite a difficult little\r\nbit of work in connection with the Brooklyn Gas Company), \"and do it in\r\ngood shape, I'll ask John Moore to run up to Boston next week and\r\nlisten to your story. If he says it looks anything like good, I'll go\r\nover it with you to a finish.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brooklyn job was done on time, and I began on John Moore in my\r\noffice at my hotel in Boston just after breakfast one bleak, rainy\r\nmorning the week following. I talked for five straight-away hours, and\r\nhe listened. He was a good listener. On all stock things he was\r\nadmirably posted, and it was not necessary to waste words. I wasted\r\nnone. I knew my subject from the letter-head to \"Yours truly,\" and I was\r\nplaying for a stake that looked as big to me as the sun does to a\r\nsolitary-confinement life prisoner. At the end of the five uninterrupted\r\nhours I agreed with Moore that I had nothing more to produce, and I\r\nlooked for my verdict. Before starting I had felt sure of winning him;\r\nwhen I was half through I knew nothing could stand against my arguments,\r\nand when I had said the last word I felt satisfied that, being human and\r\nintelligent, he must be convinced. It took him only ten minutes to show\r\nme that I had been talking against ten-inch armor-plate, and that he\r\nmeant it absolutely when he said, \"Lawson, I want to see it your way,\r\nbut I can't.\"\r\n\r\nIt was John Moore's turn then, and he showed me the good thing in an\r\nindustrial scheme he was floating at that time, and as he wound up he\r\nsaid pleasantly:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, we must do something to show for our long talk, so I'll put you\r\ndown for $50,000 underwriting.\" And he did.\r\n\r\nIf John Moore had seen \"Coppers\" as I tried to show them to him that wet\r\nmorning he could not have made for himself less than three to five\r\nmillions, for in the operation which hung on his decision I had expected\r\nto buy stocks that soon after doubled and trebled in value. Calumet &\r\nHecla then sold at 256, and later as high as 900, while Boston &\r\nMontana, then 50, mounted to 520. On the other hand, the stock of which\r\nhe had sold me $50,000 worth returned at the end of the year but a mere\r\nfraction of that amount, and was one of the worst failures of the\r\nindustrial boom period. It cost John Moore not only an enormous amount\r\nof money, but also prestige, and its miscarriage was one of the few bad\r\ndisappointments of his brilliant career. Afterward, when \"Coppers\" were\r\nthe rage and all Wall Street was green with envy at our success and his\r\nenterprise was trying to hide itself behind the garbage barrels, John\r\nMoore said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, we all think we are the masters of our own fortunes, but we are\r\nnot. We are only working on a schedule laid out by some One who does not\r\ntake our desires into consideration.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is so. The ablest Wall Street man is only like the burglar who,\r\nafter working for weeks to loot a second story, is astounded to find,\r\nwhile lugging his swag by the police station, that the bag he thought\r\nfull of dead sealskins contains a live parrot with a lusty vocabulary,\r\n\"Police! Robbers!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nROGERS GRASPS \"COPPERS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day our gas business brought me to New York, and after Mr.\r\nRogers and myself had threshed out the matter I had come about, he said\r\nwith a smile:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've heard from John Moore. Are you satisfied now? Will you drop\r\nthat copper will-o'-the-wisp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from it,\" I replied. \"I'm surer than ever of my position. In going\r\nover the ground with Moore I got the whole business in perspective, and\r\nnow I know I'm right. All his argument amounted to anyway was that it\r\nwas impossible for so gigantic a thing to have lain out in the travelled\r\nhighways all these years.\"\r\n\r\nI ran on vigorously for a few moments, in a way I felt might pique his\r\ncuriosity, if it did not gain my point. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Lawson, what more can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" I answered: \"go over the matter fully with me yourself. I will\r\nsurely carry it through one way or another; if not with you, with\r\nothers, and I cannot drop it with you until I have your personal\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly came one of those flash decisions for which H. H. Rogers is\r\nnoted among his business associates, the oft-proved correctness of which\r\ngoes far toward making him the pre-eminent American financier of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"be in New York next Sunday, and I will listen until\r\nyou have run the subject out.\"\r\n\r\nThat decision changed the face of the copper world.\r\n\r\nSunday is Mr. Rogers' pick of days for a lengthy hearing, and returning\r\nfrom church, he came directly to the \"stowaway\" rooms at the Murray Hill\r\nHotel, at which we frequently met while the Wall Street world was\r\ntrying to trace and keep track of our movements. I had been there for\r\nsome time awaiting him and was keyed for the struggle.\r\n\r\nOf my ability to land John Moore I had felt confident, yet I had failed;\r\nbut this time in advance I knew success was mine. Experience has taught\r\nme that in all dollar matters the man to \"talk up to\" is the actual\r\nowner of the dollars you are after, who when he hears your story and\r\nweighs your goods can deal out the _yes_ or _no_ which means business. I\r\nhad discovered some years before that few bull's-eyes are scored\r\nshooting at a target by mail or messenger. One's finest word-pictures\r\nsound better than they read, and if you would have the next man see them\r\nin as vivid colors as they appear on your mind's canvas, you must paint\r\nthem before his eyes. The enthusiasm of the artist, his love of the\r\nsubject, the deep or high tones of his voice, the very movements of his\r\nhands, are all factors in aiding the other man's vision. When he sees\r\nwhat you do, you have won. Nowadays when I have things to sell, I engage\r\nthe eyes as well as the ears of my purchaser. When the other fellow\r\nwould make me his customer, he must first sell his goods to my\r\nsecretary, who may, if he can, sell them to me. Thus I am always able to\r\ndispose of the only merchandise I keep in stock, honest goods, and I\r\nseldom buy chromos for oils.\r\n\r\nAs I waited the coming of my most powerful customer, I could not keep my\r\nmind off the momentousness of the interview before me. I knew I was at a\r\nfork of the road, at one of those departure points from which coming\r\nevents must date, and I thought of a dream I had had years before in\r\nwhich I found myself drifting with the grim ferryman across the brimming\r\nflood, the far bank of which is eternity. In my hand was a long staff\r\nwith strange and irregular notches on it. And these represented the\r\nactions of my life. Some were shallow, others deep and wide, and as I\r\nran my fingers up and down, I seemed to remember what each nick\r\ncommemorated--the good things and the bad things, here a death, there a\r\ndisappointment, this a victory, that an error. I wondered, as the\r\ncircumstances of the dream came to my mind, what kind of marking this\r\nday's events would make on my life staff, and I felt a conviction that\r\nit would be both deep and wide.\r\n\r\nThen, as I heard Mr. Rogers' footstep outside my door, I forgot all\r\nabout dreams and notches and plunged into my argument.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I began, \"you and your associates have unlimited money.\r\nYou have not always had it. You have obtained it through business\r\nprojects and you are using it in business projects to get more. There\r\nare two ways of adding new dollars to those in your possession: by\r\ntaking them from others so they are losers and you the gainer, whereby\r\nyou win at the cost of their happiness; or by expanding the world's\r\nwealth so that others gain when you do. You, I know, prefer the latter,\r\nthat others should make money when you do, rather than that they should\r\nlose and suffer when you are benefited.\"\r\n\r\nI did not then know \"Standard Oil's\" and the \"System's\" religion as I do\r\nnow. I had yet to learn the cruelly cynical principles that guide this\r\nfinancial Juggernaut in its relation with men and things. I imputed to\r\nit the generosity and freedom which seemed to characterize Henry H.\r\nRogers' personality, ignorant that the man and the machine he served\r\nmight stand for different things. The \"System's\" Big Book says: \"A\r\ndollar honestly made makes another for some one else; but a dollar taken\r\nis two dollars, because it increases our power and diminishes the\r\npeople's. Between the 'System' and the people must be eternal war, and\r\nit is the price of the 'System's' existence that all opportunities of\r\nweakening the people are sternly utilized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I continued, \"I have discovered in 'Coppers' an\r\nopportunity whereby you and your associates can, by the investment of a\r\nhundred millions of dollars, obtain these results: _First_, your money\r\nwill be as safe as in anything you now have it invested in. _Second_, by\r\nindorsing this form of investment with the seal of your business\r\nsuccess, you will make it known to all who have money and there will at\r\nonce arise a tremendous demand for its securities. This demand will\r\ndrive prices up until dividend returns are in normal proportion to the\r\nlegitimate value of the security, namely, four to six per cent., which\r\nis, as I can prove to you, a little more than can be got from anything\r\nelse but 'Copper' with the same elements of safety. _Third_, when the\r\nadvance I foresee occurs, your one hundred millions have doubled, and\r\nall those who have joined us in the venture or have held on to their\r\nstock will gain in the same proportion. As I estimate that we will have\r\nbut a third interest in all the good American 'Coppers,' there should be\r\nsomething like $200,000,000 for the people, while we will have made\r\n$100,000,000. To bring this about I have planned a campaign which will\r\nmake what you have done known from one end of the world to the other,\r\nand will persuade the people at large to look at 'Standard Oil' in a\r\nmore favorable light than they do now. And, what is more, all this money\r\ncan be made and all these benefits rendered without taxing any one a\r\nsingle additional dollar, for there will not be a penny a ton added to\r\nthe price of copper the metal, nor a reduction of a mill a year taken\r\nfrom the wages of those who mine it or work it.\"\r\n\r\nHere I halted. I had made a beginning, and I was familiar with Mr.\r\nRogers' system of diagnosis and treatment. Propositions placed on his\r\noperating-table are invariably dissected in parts--this is the winner's\r\nmethod; so if, under the probe of his keen mind, one section or limb is\r\nfound stiff, dead, or unhitchable to that to which it belongs, he at\r\nonce stops operating and the corpse is removed.\r\n\r\n\"How is it the situation is as you outline it?\"\r\n\r\nI drew the picture of copper Boston as I have given it in the early part\r\nof this chapter. It astonished him.\r\n\r\n\"How do you prove that safety in this class of investment is more\r\nassured than in others?\"\r\n\r\nI reeled off the facts: A copper-mine, from the very nature of the\r\nbusiness, must be developed years and years ahead before it entered the\r\nranks as a regular producer. The price of the metal being practically\r\nfixed within certain limits, the mine's value, present and future, could\r\nalways be told to a certainty.\r\n\r\nHe saw it. He put me through a thorough examination about my second\r\nclaim that the price would advance 100 per cent. I again astonished him\r\nby showing him what a market there was and had been for many years for\r\ncopper stocks, and that it was simply a question of educating investors\r\nat large to their merits to advance them to the price my plans called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the question of the amount to be invested and the\r\naggregate amount of profit, he did not attempt to disguise his surprise\r\nwhen I showed him there were 150,000 shares of Boston & Montana which\r\nhad been selling at 20-odd and were now 50-odd, and could surely be\r\nbought between 50 and 100; and 200,000 shares of Butte & Boston, 100,000\r\noutside of what I and those who had bought with me owned that could be\r\nhad at an average of 20 or 25; that there were 100,000 shares of Calumet\r\n& Hecla, selling at 250, large quantities of which could be gathered in\r\nbetween that price and 400, and so on through the list. Mine after mine\r\nI enumerated to him, all as sure dividend earners in the future as they\r\nhad been in the past, to an aggregate, without touching any of the\r\nuncertain ones, which it would surely take one hundred millions to\r\npurchase, and as I called them off, he listened patiently while I gave\r\nhim a full history of each.\r\n\r\nThen I outlined my sensational but never before attempted plan of\r\ncampaign for educating the public, he vigorously questioning me as to\r\ndetails and particulars the while.\r\n\r\nIt does not take Henry H. Rogers months, weeks, nor even days to grasp\r\nany plan, however vast, nor many minutes to come to a decision after he\r\nhas grasped it. I believe he would, if the world were going to be\r\nauctioned off next week, be the first man on earth to decide upon a\r\nlimit price that he would take it at, and three minutes after it was\r\nknocked down to him he would be selling stock in it at 150 per cent.\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nJust before lunch-time I saw that the effect of my arguments on Mr.\r\nRogers was the exact opposite to that they had made on John Moore. When\r\nI had come to a finish, Mr. Rogers simply said: \"It's curious, Lawson,\r\nwhy I have not listened to you before. I'll talk with William\r\nRockefeller to-morrow. No--I'll make it this afternoon if I can get at\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his eyes snapped a bit when, as I was helping him on with his coat,\r\nhe said, \"We must not lose a minute in getting to work.\"\r\n\r\nAs he left the hotel and before I crossed the street to the Grand\r\nCentral to take my train back to Boston--I suppose I should not say it,\r\nbut I shook my own hand in self-congratulation. How many times since I\r\nhave thought that had old Dame Fate but hung out a danger-signal for\r\nthis faithful servitor of her behests, or had but given him a glimpse\r\nahead through the years 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1904, instead\r\nof using his hands in cordial self-clasping he would have employed his\r\nfeet in the more fitting task of kicking himself.\r\n\r\nIf Henry H. Rogers had been slow at getting started on \"Coppers,\" once\r\nin he made up for his early tardiness. After our Sunday interview things\r\nmoved swiftly forward. Before noon next day he called me up on the\r\ntelephone to say that both he and William Rockefeller were impatient to\r\nhave my facts and figures verified, and would I at once send my data to\r\nstart his experts on? I mailed him a bale of \"pointers,\" and from that\r\nhour until the flotation of Amalgamated Mr. Rogers' enthusiasm on\r\n\"Coppers\" constantly grew until there actually came a time when it went\r\nbeyond my own. It took him months to complete that rounding-up of the\r\nsituation which is the absolutely necessary preliminary to the making of\r\nfinal decisions on any far-reaching and important project to which the\r\nmagic name of \"Standard Oil\" is to be permanently attached.\r\n\r\nThis period of waiting I duly improved by continuing my fight on Butte &\r\nBoston, and by way of intensifying the campaign I included Boston &\r\nMontana in the tussle, and led a fierce attack into the stronghold of my\r\nopponents. While this war was at its bitter height I received word from\r\n26 Broadway that at last reports were all in, and that they were ready\r\nto talk business. Next day I was in New York.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"our experts have examined your plans step\r\nby step and have verified your conclusions. It is an exceptional\r\nsituation, and one we are equipped to handle.\"\r\n\r\nThen and there we had a \"to-a-finish-sit-down,\" and while I had in my\r\ntime gone pretty thoroughly into the general subject of \"Coppers,\" and\r\nthought myself well informed thereon, I was surprised at the\r\ncompleteness and detail of the reports that had been prepared for the\r\n\"System's\" master. In beautiful shape, concise, clear, comprehensive,\r\nthe entire copper industry of the world was spread out before me. Every\r\nmine had its place and its history--not merely the mines of America, but\r\nthose of Europe as well; and fully set forth were the extent and cost of\r\nthe product of each, the profit it made, the men who owned it,\r\nand--miraculous \"Standard Oil\"--the standing, financial and otherwise,\r\nof the men who might have to be dealt with in our prospective trades.\r\n\r\nRogers smiled watching my growing surprise as I ran over the\r\nextraordinary budget of facts he had collected. I said to him:\r\n\r\n\"This is wonderful. You have here all there's to be known about the\r\nsubject, and I marvel how you got hold of so much inside information.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Standard Oil' has its own way of doing things,\" he replied. \"You told\r\nus your copper plans would mean an investment of $100,000,000 of our\r\nmoney, and now's the time, not after we have parted with it, to find\r\njust what we are to get for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe world has never yet heard of \"Standard Oil\" locking its barn door\r\nafter some one has stolen its mule; for that matter, it is not of record\r\nthat any one ever locked the gate after his barn had been visited by\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" The reason is that, with the thoroughness characteristic\r\nof this great reaping-machine, it never fails to take the barn with the\r\nmule.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting it was agreed that Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller,\r\nand myself should become partners in my plan of \"Coppers,\" they to\r\nfurnish the capital and to have three-quarters of the profit, I to have\r\nthe remaining quarter. The campaign for the execution of the enterprise\r\nI agreed to work out and submit as soon as possible, and we parted.\r\n\r\nAs I bade them good-by Mr. Rogers said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Your baby is born, Lawson, and if you put the same kind of work on\r\nraising it you have in bringing it into the world, it will be a giant.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day it was understood that we were together, and that all my\r\ndealings in \"Coppers\" outside Butte & Boston were for the joint\r\naccount--that is, they were to have the right to come into all my\r\noperations. Those they did not care to join in I had the right to put\r\nthrough alone. On the other hand, I must not undertake anything on their\r\nbehalf without a specific understanding with them.\r\n\r\nThus began Amalgamated, that extraordinary dollar-thing which shot up in\r\na night and grew as grows the whirlwind, until even its creators\r\nwondered at its mightiness. It waxed greater and stronger while the\r\nworld watched and waited, until finally there came that tremendous and\r\nunprecedented culmination when lines of investors fought round the\r\nportals of the greatest money mart in America, the National City Bank,\r\nfor a chance to obtain the $100 shares of this $75,000,000 institution.\r\nAnd the world wondered indeed when it was announced that Amalgamated had\r\nbeen oversubscribed over $300,000,000.\r\n\r\nThus began Amalgamated. It might have brought to all the world good-will\r\nand happiness, and to the men who made it much glory and the great\r\nregard of their fellows. Instead, it has wrought havoc and desolation,\r\nand its Apache-like trail is strewn with the scalped and mutilated\r\ncorpses of its victims. The very name _Amalgamated_ conjures up visions\r\nof hatred and betrayal, of ambush, pitfalls, and assassination. It\r\nstands forth the Judas of corporations, a monument to greed and a\r\nwarning to rapacity. May the story that I am to tell so set forth its\r\ninfamies and horrors that never again shall such a monster be suffered\r\nto violate and defile our civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE COPPER CAMPAIGN OPENS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy plans for the great copper campaign were most carefully diagrammed,\r\nthen spread before Mr. Rogers and Mr. Rockefeller, who, before\r\napproving, tested every detail of them. The formal scope of our action\r\ndecided on, it was agreed that I should be free to work in my own way,\r\nand it was understood that I should, as far as possible, carry the\r\ncampaign on my own shoulders, using to the limit my personal capital and\r\ncredit. \"Coppers\" was to be a Lawson operation on the face of it, and I\r\nwas determined, for many reasons, to avail myself of \"Standard Oil's\"\r\naid only in taking care of completed transactions and not at all in the\r\npreliminary negotiations. This was not always possible, but my attitude\r\nin the matter and my desire to make a brilliant showing explain the\r\nstraits I was sometimes put to in conducting some of my deals. From the\r\nstart I had a big personal stake in the success of my campaign, for at\r\nthe time I first showed Mr. Rogers my hand I had 46,000 shares of Butte\r\n& Boston, and my following among the public owned as many more. They had\r\nagreed that the profits on this stock, when it was taken into the\r\nconsolidation, should be mine entirely in payment of my own work and\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nThere was another transaction I had in mind which also fairly belonged\r\nto me. As I have stated, I had undertaken to dispose of Bay State Gas\r\nstock, and by this time I had succeeded in placing a large number of the\r\nshares. The proceeds, $2,300,000, were in the treasury of the company.\r\nNow the charter of Addicks' company permitted it to buy, sell, and deal\r\nin anything and everything, and I saw here a good opportunity to enable\r\nBay State to earn the balance of the money necessary to relieve its\r\nindebtedness to Mr. Rogers--between four and six millions of dollars.\r\nSo I explained to Mr. Rogers that as soon as our copper deal had\r\nprogressed to a point where there was absolutely no risk, and a large\r\ngain was assured, I would make a bargain with Bay State whereby for a\r\npart of the profits I would pilot the investment of the company's cash\r\nin Butte & Boston. This proposition he considered fair, and he agreed\r\nthat neither he nor Mr. Rockefeller would consider themselves \"in\" on\r\nthat bargain, save as indirectly profiting by it through the successful\r\nwinding up of their Boston gas investments.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for any great move to be begun in the stock-market\r\nwithout some suggestion getting into the air which notifies \"the\r\nStreet\"[19] that \"something is up.\" Not long after my alliance with\r\nRogers had been formally arranged, the atmosphere of State Street grew\r\nthick with rumors about \"Coppers.\" Some of these announced that I had\r\nhitched up with \"Standard Oil\"; others denied it; between them all a\r\nmovement was created, and the leading stocks became very active and\r\nincreased rapidly in price.\r\n\r\nWe had agreed that the first companies to go into our consolidation\r\nshould be Butte & Boston, Boston & Montana, Calumet & Hecla, Osceola,\r\nQuincy, Tamarack, and any other of the long-established properties of\r\nwhich we could get hold. It would be difficult, we knew, to purchase the\r\ncontrol of the Calumet & Hecla, for its owners thought too highly of\r\ntheir investment to part with it, but it was safe to buy whatever was\r\noffered, and if we accumulated less than a majority of the shares we\r\ncould easily resell at a large profit. I began my operation with Boston\r\n& Montana stock, buying cautiously and obtaining it at fair prices, and\r\nthis transaction, though conducted quietly, added fresh fuel to the\r\nrumor blaze. Finally Boston became so excited over the situation that I\r\ncame out with a public statement in which I frankly showed what I was\r\ntrying to do. In all such affairs, however, the explanations of any man\r\nknown in his business as a stock speculator or manipulator are never\r\naccepted as true. It is assumed that such announcements are merely\r\nblinds to disguise his real purpose; that they are feints or\r\nmanoeuvres in his campaign. So when I declared that I was working out\r\nplans for the consolidation of all good Boston \"Coppers,\" and that\r\nassociated with me were the strongest capitalists in the world, a laugh\r\nwent up from a goodly portion of \"the Street.\" The hireling news bureaus\r\nshrieked at my presumption and the absurdity of my combination, and when\r\nafter a hot day's operations I was quoted in the financial press as\r\ntelling my followers that it was \"Standard Oil\" money which was to back\r\n\"Coppers,\" Barron, whose News Bureau moulded opinion for the opposing\r\ncopper magnates, came out with a statement:\r\n\r\n     \"Lawson is spreading in his peculiar underground ways that\r\n     the Standard Oil crowd is looking into Coppers. Just enough\r\n     countrymen swallowed his yarns to enable him to boost prices\r\n     over six points to-day, but by to-morrow, when the\r\n     Rockefellers or Rogers of Standard Oil put their foot down\r\n     on his transparent lies, those who were foolish enough to\r\n     listen to his ridiculous fakes will find they must sell at a\r\n     loss. We can say, on a high authority in Standard Oil, that\r\n     they have never bought nor contemplate buying a share of any\r\n     copper stock.\"\r\n\r\nMy enemies were numerous and powerful, and there were many other\r\nannouncements of the same character as Barron's tending to cast ridicule\r\non my movement and expose me as a falsifier. Indeed, notwithstanding the\r\nmerits of the plan and the benefit it must confer on all copper\r\nproperties, I was assailed as fiercely as though I had advocated anarchy\r\nor had prepared a scheme of wholesale plundering. In stock affairs\r\ninnovations are resented and resisted even more fiercely than in other\r\nwalks of life, and the Boston money crowd fought me tooth and nail. The\r\ntitles I acquired in those days were varied and startling. For one set I\r\nwas a \"charlatan,\" \"wizard,\" \"fakir,\" an \"unprincipled manipulator\"; in\r\nanother I was a \"copper king\" or a \"prince of plungers.\" Feeling ran\r\nhigh, and prices rose and fell in the most erratic and extravagant\r\nfashion. Certain stocks advanced or receded from five to ten points in\r\nas many hours or minutes. Fortunes were made and lost daily. Many\r\npeople, confused by the conflict of opinions and announcements, sold\r\ntheir holdings, only to repurchase at higher prices as prices continued\r\nto mount. So fiercely was I attacked that it almost seemed at times as\r\nif my enemies might prevail in spite of the great powers at my back.\r\nIndeed, there were tense moments when my fate as well as my plans\r\ntrembled in the balance. Several times I was sent for by Rogers and his\r\ncolleagues for a war council, and sometimes, as I detailed my lines of\r\ndefence and enumerated my resources, I suspected that even these\r\nstorm-seasoned warriors were tiring of the fray.\r\n\r\nThe fiercest fighting at that early period centred round Butte & Boston\r\nand Boston & Montana. Many a spirited engagement we fought on the floor\r\nof the Exchange. Perhaps the fiercest of these began when, after a\r\nstrenuous rush one morning, I rapidly carried the price of Butte up.\r\nThis exploit so enraged my adversaries that they got together and\r\norganized a powerful combination against me. This included several of\r\nthe leading banks and trust companies of Boston that held large amounts\r\nof stocks as collateral for my loans. At a given moment it was arranged\r\nthat all these loans, aggregating millions of dollars, should be called;\r\nand further to intensify the complication they expected to bring about,\r\na great friend in common attempted to scare Mr. Rockefeller and Mr.\r\nRogers by informing them that the titles to the copper properties were\r\ndefective, and that a man, then unknown, named Heinze, who had made\r\nhimself very strong with the Montana courts, was about to make a move to\r\nconfiscate them. There was a hurry call for me from New York, and this\r\ntime the explanations had to be very full, for \"Standard Oil\" had an\r\nimpression that while my general plan might be meritorious, it was\r\npossible that I had the details \"skewed.\" However, I satisfied them as\r\nto the facts and then hurried back to tackle my own problem, for these\r\nindividual engagements I handled myself, using my own personal resources\r\nto take care of them. The emergency that had developed thus suddenly was\r\nso serious as to be alarming, and it devolved on me to act, and at\r\nonce. Blows in finance are like those at sea--the most dangerous are the\r\nquick-come-quick-go kind. I recalled one I had run into a short time\r\nbefore on my sailing yacht. We were broad-reaching down the New England\r\ncoast, close in, with a 20-knot sou'wester blowing. Suddenly, without\r\napparent reason, my skipper put the wheel hard down and brought the\r\ncraft up standing. A second later a \"twister\" from the hills hit us, and\r\nadroitly he headed her into it.\r\n\r\n\"How in the world did you know that was coming?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I smelt her, sir,\" the old sea-dog replied, \"just smelt her.\"\r\n\r\nFor those unacquainted with the freaky ways of our New England coast\r\nwinds it may be explained that when a \"twister\" off the hills gets ready\r\nto do business in a 20-knot sou'wester it sends no messenger boys ahead\r\nto distribute its itinerary handbills. You hear one shriek and the blow\r\nis upon you; and woe betide the unthinking skipper who attempts holding\r\nhis craft to her course or paying her off till she catches it full. He\r\nis likely to have mourners at home if a married man, and \"cussing\"\r\nowners if the craft is not his own. As my old sea-dog afterward wisely\r\nobserved: \"When you smell a land 'twister,' act first and think\r\natterwards, or your widow 'ill get blear-eyed watching for you to make\r\nharbor.\"\r\n\r\nIn the stock-market it was decidedly a case of \"act first and think\r\natterwards.\" The \"twister\" was a fierce one, for not only were my stocks\r\nassailed, but the rumor machines were turning out all sorts of yarns\r\naffecting my credit, as the knowledge gradually filtered through the\r\nmarket that my loans had been called. My stocks broke badly, and when\r\nthe market closed it really seemed as though I might have to verify the\r\nreport that they would wind me up the next day.\r\n\r\nIt was at this particular stage that the Bay State was let into the\r\ndeal. I had a long consultation with Addicks that night and showed him\r\nmy hand. He agreed that with what I already had of the stock and\r\n\"Standard Oil's\" backing, the venture came as near being an absolutely\r\nsure thing as could ever be found in stocks. My proposition was that I\r\nshould secure for the Bay State Company 50,000 shares of Butte at an\r\naverage of 20 to 25, and that I should have half the profits of the\r\nventure provided they aggregated over two millions of dollars. Coming to\r\nAddicks in this emergency was cold-blooded business on my part, and, it\r\ngoes without saying, was frozen-blooded business on his, for he\r\nevidently saw then what I did not until later, that there was an\r\nexcellent opportunity to practise his pet game--make money and\r\ndouble-cross his partner while doing so. We clinched the deal that\r\nnight, and next day in the market I turned the tables, for I took every\r\nshare my opponents offered for sale, and the stock, instead of dropping\r\nout of sight, became firm, then began to mount, and never after fell\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Bay State's venture showed a profit afterward of four millions of\r\ndollars, but of my share of this large sum I was deprived, as I will\r\ndetail later.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture there occurred one of those strange and sad fatalities\r\nwhich with its attendant circumstances helps to explain why those of us\r\nwho play with stock-markets grow superstitious. I have spoken of my\r\nsecretary, Mr. Vinal, a man of admirable discretion and absolute\r\nloyalty, who was my right hand in executing the minutiæ of the various\r\noperations I then was engaged in. In such affairs the fidelity of one's\r\naides must be beyond all question, for if the merest detail of one's\r\nplans leaks out at the critical moment, one is undone beyond recovery.\r\nAfter my talk with Addicks I had laid out the campaign for the next\r\nday's engagement and called in Vinal to explain to him his own part. He\r\nwas to attend to taking up and transferring the loans that had been\r\ncalled, and I armed him with my power of attorney and blank checks,\r\ninstructing him to put these matters through without further\r\nconsultation with me, for my entire time must belong to my brokers\r\nduring the battle of prices which I knew must inevitably come with the\r\nstroke of the gong that opened the Exchange next morning at ten, and\r\nwhich would rage until its close at three. As I had anticipated, the\r\nassault was fierce. It was give and take, charge and retreat, all day. A\r\nfew minutes after twelve, Vinal pushed through a crowd of brokers to me\r\nand said: \"I'm about half through my shifting, but a telephone has just\r\ncome from Mrs. Lawson saying that something has happened at the school\r\nand will I at once get a carriage and bring your daughters home. It will\r\ntake half an hour. Shall I go?\" I replied: \"You had better, but get back\r\nas quickly as possible.\" A minute later a thought occurred to me, and I\r\nsent a boy to call Vinal back. He reported that my secretary had jumped\r\ninto \"Ben's\" cab (\"Ben\" was a cabman whose stand had been in front of my\r\noffice, 33 State Street, since my boyhood days). I returned to the fray.\r\nFifteen minutes later the appalling message that startled all Boston at\r\nthe time came over the ticker tape: \"Terrible Explosion! Boston Gas\r\nCompany's pipes in the Subway have blown scores to death.\" Then there\r\nfloated in to me a rumor, vague, indefinite, that Vinal was a victim. I\r\njumped into a cab and in a few moments was at the undertaker's to whose\r\nplace the corpses were being removed. The undertaker stepped up to me\r\nand said: \"Poor Vinal! Don't look at him, for it is frightful. He was on\r\nthe very apex of the explosion, and he and 'Ben' were both instantly\r\nkilled and are frightfully burned. The only thing recognizable is this\r\nenvelope, which I found among the rags that were left of his coat.\" He\r\nhanded me over the large envelope in which I had seen Vinal that very\r\nmorning depositing the various documents, checks, and securities which\r\nhe required for his day's operations. It was burned around the edges,\r\nbut the contents were uninjured, and among the papers was a carefully\r\nprepared memorandum showing to a dot where my secretary had left off in\r\nhis exchanges. He had evidently just finished making notes, for so\r\ncarefully arranged were the contents of the envelope that all that was\r\nnecessary to complete the business was to turn it over to Vinal's\r\nassistant. No further explanation was required. That envelope\r\nrepresented two millions of money and securities.\r\n\r\nPoor Vinal! Another victim of that soulless corporation hag, Boston Gas,\r\nto prolong whose life he had spent some of the best years of his own.\r\nVinal was very dear to me. He had filled my canteen, held my ammunition,\r\nand carried my knapsack through many a hard-fought battle, willingly\r\nallowing others to do the cheering in victory, but reserving to himself\r\nthe right to suggest and console when the clouds lowered and we were\r\nleft alone on the field of defeat or the dusty road of retreat. Poor\r\nVinal! He was worth a hundred copper deals or corporation hags.\r\n\r\nBetween death and life, success and failure, what a hair's-breadth after\r\nall. If Vinal had stubbed his toe, or had been able to take the first\r\ncab he found; if he had heard my call which would have brought him back;\r\nif he had tarried a moment longer in the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation where he had stopped to deliver a message, he would have\r\nescaped. The thought did not occur to me at the moment, for Vinal's\r\ndeath was too keen a personal sorrow to allow me to estimate my own\r\nnarrow escape, but if that envelope, so miraculously preserved, had been\r\nburned as were the other papers in my secretary's pocket, there might\r\nhave been no Amalgamated. \"Coppers\" must have dropped back to the lowly\r\nplace from which Rogers had lifted them, for I should have been\r\nfinancially ruined.\r\n\r\nTo show the marvelous workings of Him who tempers the wind to the shorn\r\nlamb: At the same moment that I was called away from my guns, the\r\ncommanding general of the opposing forces received the same call. The\r\naged mother of the President of the Boston & Montana and Butte & Boston,\r\nwhile riding in her carriage, had been a victim of the same explosion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] \"The Street\" is a general term used to designate the stock operators,\r\nthe fraternity in New York being known as Wall Street, in Boston as State\r\nStreet, and in Philadelphia as Broad Street; these streets are the centre\r\nof the financial districts of their respective cities, the Stock Exchanges\r\nbeing situated on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE BUNCOING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF UTAH\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was veritably a period of financial delirium in Boston. No one\r\ntalked or thought of aught but \"Coppers,\" at least no one with a spare\r\ndollar or good credit. The air was full of mysterious yarns and the\r\nStock Exchange was hung with Aladdin lamps. From every nook and corner\r\nof State Street, from the chinks between its sedate old cobblestones,\r\ncame forth copper-mines--mines undreamt of before and unheard of since.\r\nInnumerable devices were rigged to take advantage of the prevailing\r\nintoxication. The prices of the strong properties leaped up with\r\nbreath-taking rapidity. The copper epidemic spread over New England and\r\nbegan to extend in constantly widening circles through the rest of the\r\ncountry, while from England, France, and Germany came daily news of\r\nsymptoms which proved that the infection had crossed the ocean. I, with\r\nmy hands full, kept two secretaries busy shooing away industrious\r\npromoters who came at me in armies with old and new copper properties,\r\nwhich I might have on my own or any old terms.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement I had my first real demonstration of the\r\n\"System's\" method of making dollars from nothing. Well as I thought I\r\nknew the stock game, I'll admit that I looked on open-mouthed, like the\r\nveriest novice, at the magic wrought by the simple use of the name\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" Even now I can hear myself as I gasped: \"Heaven help the\r\npeople if this sort of thing can be done in America, for Heaven alone\r\nhas power to help them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boston and New York brokerage house of Clark, Ward & Co. had\r\npromoted the Utah Consolidated Mining Company of Utah. It was less than\r\ntwo years old, and its 300,000 shares had been kicked from gutter to\r\ncurb and curb to gutter at from $2 to $4 per share. Samuel Untermyer,\r\nthe astute corporation lawyer who, on his own account and as the\r\nrepresentative of a large European clientele, had long been interested\r\nin \"Coppers,\" had taken hold of Utah, and believing it a good thing had\r\nbought large quantities of its stock for himself and his European\r\nconnections. Under the stimulus of my campaign the price of this stock\r\nhad leaped to 17 or 18, and rumor had it that Utah was a prospective\r\nfactor in my consolidation. One day Mr. Rogers asked me if I were in any\r\nway responsible for these rumors, and I replied that I knew nothing more\r\nabout them than that they were in circulation.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" replied Rogers. \"Do this, then--send word that we propose to\r\nissue a denial that we are to have anything to do with Utah\r\nConsolidated, and bring me their answer.\"\r\n\r\nI carried the message in person. The Utah people were absolutely\r\npanic-stricken. Such an announcement meant destruction to the pretty\r\nprice-fabric they were rearing, and they begged to be allowed to make a\r\nproposition to Rogers before he should declare himself. This was their\r\nproposal: That Mr. Rogers should admit their property to the\r\nconsolidation provided he found it good enough; that every facility\r\nshould be accorded his experts to examine the mine; and that if the\r\nreport was favorable, and they were convinced that it would be, and he\r\ndecided to take hold, he should be given an option on a block of stock\r\nway below the market.\r\n\r\nThis offer I took back to Mr. Rogers, who smiled one of his thin, easy\r\nsmiles, and questioned me closely about the genuineness of the market\r\nfor this stock. Could 50,000 shares be sold readily? I assured him that\r\nwhen it once became known that we were even looking at Utah it would be\r\neasy to sell 100,000 shares and at constantly advancing prices.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"if you're sure of this we'll go ahead.\r\nTell them we'll take a sixty-day option on 50,000 shares, no liability\r\nto us, at--well, we'll be liberal, say at 15, and when you mention the\r\nprice impress upon them that I know it cost them but $2 to $4.\"\r\n\r\nI returned at once and began negotiations, but, as is usually the case,\r\nthe fact that \"Standard Oil\" was nibbling leaked before I had clinched\r\nthe option, and before we had even begun to examine the property, prices\r\nhad advanced until there was a profit of $500,000 for us in the\r\ntransaction. To look over the Utah property Mr. Rogers sent his\r\nson-in-law, Broughton, and in a short time I got word to feed out the\r\n50,000 shares on the market at the best prices obtainable, and to borrow\r\nit for delivery in such ways that the Clark-Ward-Untermyer contingent\r\nshould suspect nothing about it. No information was given me as to the\r\nexpert's report, and I was absolutely ignorant whether it was good, bad,\r\nor indifferent, though from the fact that we were to sell the stock I\r\ninferred that it was unfavorable. The public took the 50,000 shares at\r\nbetween 32 and 36, much as an elephant takes in water after a thirsty\r\ntramp across sandy deserts--the shares were just sucked in without a\r\ngulp or a gasp. I did not know until long afterward that the purchasers\r\nwere the English holders who had contributed the greater part of the\r\n50,000 shares to meet our option--in other words, were buying back from\r\nus their own stock at more than twice the price we were to pay them for\r\nit, and that their eagerness was due to confidential information that\r\nthe expert's examination had disclosed such richness that the price\r\nwould surely jump to over $100 when \"Standard Oil\" assumed the\r\nmanagement. Just where they acquired this information or how it was put\r\nin their path was a matter I never found out. As I have previously\r\ndemonstrated, \"Standard Oil\" has its own system of wires and underground\r\npassages and rumor bureaus. It works in mysterious ways its wonders to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nThis section of the deal was soon wound up, and the transaction showed\r\nus a profit of $1,000,000. That is, we had sold 50,000 shares which we\r\ndid not possess, but which were ours on demand, for $1,000,000 more than\r\nwe should have to pay their owners for them. When I reported my success\r\nto Mr. Rogers he expressed complete satisfaction, and ordered me to\r\ninform the Utah people that another 50,000 shares must be added to the\r\noption, as he could not think of tacking the great name of \"Standard\r\nOil\" to an enterprise in which he had less than a third interest;\r\nindeed, he was not sure that he would consider less than a one-half\r\nownership. This second request was a bitter pill to the\r\nClark-Ward-Untermyer crowd, who hated to surrender for such a low figure\r\nthis tremendous parcel of a stock that was now selling fast at 40 per\r\nshare. There was no gainsaying the soundness of Rogers' reasoning,\r\nhowever: \"Who made it worth 40? Who but 'Standard Oil'? And what will\r\nhappen if 'Standard Oil' declares that it will not take Utah into the\r\nconsolidation?\" The bare suggestion threw the Utah contingent into one\r\nof those hundred-in-the-shade, twenty-below-zero sweats, which resemble\r\nthe moisture upon steam-pipes that pass through cold-storage boxes. They\r\nsuccumbed. At the moment the option was signed over to us it represented\r\na profit of $1,000,000 more, and when we sold it, it netted us\r\n$1,250,000, for the market was still climbing. This latter phenomenon\r\nwas not surprising, for it should be borne in mind that when our demand\r\nfor the second 50,000 shares was made, the heavy Utah stockholders were\r\ncalled together and it was explained to them by their own managers--not\r\nby \"Standard Oil\" or by Mr. Rogers mind, for \"Standard Oil\" never makes\r\nfalse statements--that the expert's examination had developed such\r\nwealth that \"Standard Oil,\" the mighty of mighties, had insisted on\r\nhaving at least 100,000 shares; but that, of course, \"Standard Oil\"\r\ncould not be asked to pay over twenty for stock which had cost its\r\noriginal owners but $2 to $4. What was there to do? The stockholders\r\njust gave up, and then once more climbed over one another in the market\r\nto get back their precious shares as best they could.\r\n\r\nJust to keep the conditions of the transaction at this stage before my\r\nreader's mind, I'll repeat that the Clark-Ward-Untermyer people had now\r\ngiven us the right to buy of them 100,000 shares of their stock (_at a\r\nprice $2,250,000 less than we had already sold it for_), with the\r\nunderstanding--not in words or in writing, of course, because \"Standard\r\nOil\" never makes a promise in writing, but implied as sacredly as though\r\nit had been set down and attested under oath--that we would take and\r\npay for their stock and engage with them in their enterprise, giving\r\nthem the benefit of our experience, our capital, and our prestige. I say\r\nthey had every reason to assume that we were acting in absolute good\r\nfaith, and no ground to suppose that there was any ulterior motive\r\nbehind our negotiations. It must be remembered that this occurred some\r\nyears ago, before the \"System's\" perfidy was a calculated contingency.\r\n\r\nThe knife was now in, but the \"System\" had still to corkscrew it in the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP IN FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter \"pulling off\" such a big \"trick,\" as the professional crooks put\r\nit, and getting away with such a fat bundle of \"swag,\" you, my good\r\nreader, might naturally suppose that this shining light of the \"System,\"\r\ncontented with his profits, would pass on to new victims; or, if you\r\nhave a mistaken impression of Mr. Rogers' sense of humor, for really he\r\nhas a keen sense of the ridiculous--after five o'clock on week-days and\r\nall day Sunday--you might think he would take the opportunity to order\r\nme to tack up his card on the Utah office door, inscribed, \"We will\r\nreturn when you recoup,\" and transfer his milking machine to other\r\nudders. No, that is where you, old-fashioned reader that you are, have\r\n\"sized up\" Mr. Rogers inaccurately. He had not finished.\r\n\r\nUtah was not yet exhausted as a wealth-producer for the \"System.\" After a\r\nbrief lull, representatives of Clark, Ward & Co. came to me requesting that\r\nthey be allowed to see \"Standard Oil's\" report on their mine. It was most\r\nimportant for their financial arrangements that they be told what was in\r\nstore for them. That was what they thought. I told Mr. Rogers. He\r\ninstructed me to report to the Utah people that Mr. Rogers had looked wise\r\nand said nothing. The double-perfected \"look-wise-and-say-nothing\" is one\r\nof \"Standard Oil's\" pet business devices. Whoever tries to penetrate its\r\nsecrets is always welcome to his inferences, but no one in \"Standard Oil\"\r\nis ever on record in case the inquisitive one guesses wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" Rogers said, \"just tell those people that our way of doing\r\nbusiness is to send out reports when we decide it is time for them to be\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Utah kept booming. A week before the expiration of our\r\noption, the price being then forty-five, I heard from Mr. Rogers again.\r\nHe gave me the most mysterious order of all: \"Sell 50,000 more.\" Up to\r\nthat time I should have declared to any one that I was up in all the\r\nquirks and kinks of the stock game, but this move puzzled me. However, I\r\nsold, and at the very top. We had now \"out\" 150,000 shares of Utah, had\r\nsold that number \"short,\" in fact. Clark, Ward & Co. were bound to\r\ndeliver us 100,000 shares when we called for them. These 100,000 shares\r\nhad been contributed by the large stockholders to Clark, Ward & Co. at\r\nthe price we had agreed to pay. Assuming that \"Standard Oil\" control of\r\nUtah would immensely enhance its value, the stockholders naturally\r\ndesired to replace the holdings of stock they had contributed, and\r\ninstructed Clark, Ward & Co. and other brokers to buy them back in the\r\nmarket. So Clark, Ward & Co. were carrying all one end and much of the\r\nother end of the deal, paying for the actual stock which our option\r\ncalled for as it came in, and carrying their customers for the new stock\r\npurchased for them at vastly higher prices. _But_, as we had not taken\r\nup our option and paid Clark, Ward & Co. for our stock, the money\r\nnecessary to finance the whole transaction had to be borrowed from the\r\nbanks. It is evident that, at this phase of the game, Clark, Ward & Co.\r\nmust have been, as the phrase goes, \"extended.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the operation had been in process, during the life of the option\r\nin fact, money at the \"banks\" became as \"easy\" as an old haircloth\r\nrocker for whoever desired to borrow on Utah Copper collateral. The fact\r\nwas much commented on at the time by the \"Street,\" and Clark, Ward & Co.\r\noften gratefully remarked to their customers: \"After all, 'Standard Oil'\r\nis good to its associates.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before the option matured, Mr. Rogers briefly said to me:\r\n\"Lawson, I've been thinking that Utah matter over and have made up my\r\nmind that it is not safe to go ahead unless we have the actual control\r\nof the company, 151,000 shares. Tell them so, and that we must have\r\n51,000 shares in addition to our 100,000.\"\r\n\r\nAt last his game was plain to me. I gasped as I took in all the features\r\nof the new plan. \"They'll never stand for it,\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"They won't, eh?\" he said. \"You look it over more carefully and I think\r\nyou will agree they _must_ stand it even if I make it another 100,000.\r\nThis is the situation: They are sure we are going to take and pay for\r\n100,000 shares, and in anticipation have borrowed millions on call at\r\nthe banks. For fear they may not see all the nice points of their\r\nposition you can show them that if they refuse, the banks as well as\r\nevery one else will know that we not only are not going into Utah as\r\ninvestors, but would not--in fact, could not--become connected with the\r\nmanagement, because our thorough examination of the property shows that\r\nthe mines are not as valuable as they affirmed. Now, when they grasp the\r\nfact that they have all the Utah stock they had, to start with, and\r\n150,000 more which they have bought since, they must realize that in a\r\nslump the price of their shares will go lower than the $2 or $4 it\r\nstarted from. Have no fear. Clark, Ward, and Untermyer will do just what\r\nwe ask, and, in fact, if it were not for the stir a lot of failures\r\nwould make and the bad effect these would have on our general plans, I'd\r\nrefuse to take up that option anyway, for there would be more money in\r\nbuying back in a smash what we have sold than in taking it from them at\r\nour own price,\" he went on.\r\n\r\nThe implication in my suggestion that he was going too far in the Utah\r\ndeal stung him. He said:\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Lawson, Americans who have accumulated great fortunes get\r\nno credit; on the contrary, they are unfairly treated. Instead of being\r\nhonored for our splendid efforts as evinced by our wealth, the people\r\nhowl as though they had not equal chances with us. Take this very case:\r\nwe did not ask these people to give us options; we did not ask them to\r\nallow us to become associated with them. We have done nothing but take\r\nwhat they have thrown upon us, and yet if we refuse to exercise the\r\noption we did not ask for, and there comes a smash, we should never hear\r\nthe last of how 'Standard Oil' robbed them. The more I see of the fool\r\nway Americans look at such things the less sympathy I have for their\r\nlosses and what they entail. There was a period when I allowed myself to\r\nwaste time on such ideas as you seem to entertain, but, thank goodness,\r\nI have outlived it.\"\r\n\r\nThe job cut for me was one I hated to perform. I could refuse, but what\r\nthen? Some one else would carry out Rogers' mandate, and where should I\r\nand my great copper structure be? If I balked here, they would go no\r\nfarther with me--and remember, we were just at the beginning of our\r\nassociation. Had I foreseen the misery and ruin with which the future\r\nwas fraught, I should have stopped then and there; but the future was\r\nhidden, and I was expectantly revelling in a glorious and delightful\r\nperiod in which I and all who were following me into \"Coppers\" should be\r\ngloriously successful and rich. So I looked at the situation in a\r\npractical business way, and I said to myself that even if we did insist\r\non having the 100,000 shares extra Rogers had mentioned instead of the\r\n50,000 he had decided to demand, the Clark-Ward-Untermyer combination\r\nwould still have remaining more of value than their whole property could\r\npossibly have been worth without our association. Therefore I tumbled\r\ninto their midst and dropped Mr. Rogers' bomb--and bomb it was.\r\n\r\nAt once they realized that they were looking into the cold steel muzzles\r\nof 45-calibre revolvers, for there was no concealing the\r\nmoney-or-your-life inference of the message. I had honestly tried to\r\nsoften the blow as well as I could, but all they could see was 50,000\r\nshares more at something like a million dollars less than its market\r\nvalue--or in twenty-four hours a panic and no market for their stock at\r\nany price. What could they do? With perspiration streaming in big beads\r\ndown their foreheads, they declared that even if their people were\r\nwilling to submit to the knife, it was impossible in the brief time\r\navailable to get to them. At least would I not beg Mr. Rogers and Mr.\r\nRockefeller to take up the 100,000 shares pending their negotiations for\r\nthe balance? Would I not, because they had made all their financial\r\narrangements for big payments of loans next day which they could not\r\nrenew at such short notice--I must!--I must!\r\n\r\nAs I listened to the pleadings of these men there flashed into my mind a\r\nconviction of the malignant humor of my situation. Here was I, father of\r\na plan in the successful execution of which I had figured myself out as\r\na benefactor to all concerned, turning the torture screws of \"Standard\r\nOil's\" new dollar rack--fashioned from my structure--and I was powerless\r\nto stop or rescue the screaming victim. \"But why,\" ask my readers, \"did\r\nyou not denounce the men and renounce the work, instead of profiting by\r\nit, as you undoubtedly did?\" You have never--you who ask that\r\nquestion--sat in at the great game of millions; you know nothing of the\r\nexcitement of the dollar chase, of the terrible joy of hearing, \"A\r\nmillion while you wait.\" I am not, in telling this story, setting myself\r\nup as an angel, nor posing as better than others. My experience of\r\nbusiness has demonstrated to me long before this that rapacity rules in\r\nthe modern dollar game, and that in wholesale dollar making many of the\r\nlaws of men and more of the laws of God are inevitably violated. But he\r\nwho cannot or will not play according to the rules of those who are\r\nmaking the game is disqualified. He should go elsewhere. Hitherto in my\r\nlife I had followed the code of a smaller game, in which we seldom\r\npressed an advantage to the limit or cut our pound of flesh from out a\r\nvital part. Now I had voluntarily associated myself with other men in a\r\nventure I believed was big, fair, and square, and I was learning that\r\nthe rule of their game was thumbs down--give nothing--take everything. I\r\nmight have retired, but I was already deep in, with resources pledged to\r\nthe limit; and what would my reluctance to press our advantage with\r\nClark, Ward & Co. be considered but fool sentimentality? If I insisted\r\non my view, what would happen? The people who had followed me so\r\nfar--and their number was thousands and their quality, measured by any\r\nheart and soul standard, more human than any of those whom Rogers was\r\nthumb-screwing--as well as I myself, would be surely ruined. If I went\r\non, at least I could care for those I had brought along with me. I\r\nlooked at the complication fairly and squarely, weighed my duty with\r\nsuch powers of judgment as I possessed, and decided, wisely or\r\nunwisely, that it was best to go on. Wisely or unwisely I made up my\r\nmind to accept the responsibility of acting as fireman to the\r\nengine--and to bide my time. That time, thank God, is here now.\r\n\r\nI reported to Mr. Rogers. His fox-trap jaws, with their bone-and\r\nheart-and soul-crushing teeth, came together with a snap, and when they\r\nrelaxed his lips parted into one of his marrow-chilling smiles.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said he. \"Those able gentlemen are loaded, Lawson,\r\nloaded, and without a by-your-leave have made up their minds that Mr.\r\nRockefeller and myself are only in business to draw their load to some\r\nconvenient safe-deposit vault, from which they can from time to time\r\ntake it out to pay for palaces, yachts, fast horses, and society crowns.\r\nLawson, don't tell me of their plight. Don't waste my time with their\r\npleadings.\" The tiger was awake, his cage rattled; it was raw-meat time.\r\nI watched. Presently he snapped: \"What do you suppose they would answer\r\nwere they in our position? This: 'Give us the additional 50,000 shares\r\nwe have demanded quick, or take the consequences.' They are able\r\nbusiness men, so what they would do is just good enough for us to do.\r\nTake back this answer: 'You have the only proposition we will make;\r\ndecide at once!'\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him. I said not a word--I could not. Perhaps my thoughts\r\nwere miles and ages away to scenes where Cæsars, Napoleons, and\r\nBismarcks stood gazing over fields strewn with corpses oozing blood. I\r\nremembered \"to the victor belong the spoils\"; but there also wandered\r\ninto my mind the memory of a good mother's knee on a Sunday afternoon,\r\nand of a voice which repeated, \"For what is a man profited if he shall\r\ngain the whole world and lose his own soul?\"\r\n\r\nAs I left him Mr. Rogers said:\r\n\r\n\"You had better sell 10,000 shares more of Utah. Sell them quick and\r\nsharp, and perhaps they will read our answer on the tape before you get\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nI sold the 10,000 shares. The price dropped two to three points, and,\r\nsure enough, by the time I got to Clark, Ward & Co.'s office I found\r\nthem poring dazedly over the ticker tape. They knew my answer before I\r\nstated it, and were trembling with nervous apprehension. I wondered if\r\nthey, too, saw the tiger, his bloody chops and claws and his piece of\r\nraw meat. I said what Mr. Rogers had told me to say in so many words,\r\nand then I talked frankly to them about their situation, and advised\r\nthat they meet \"Standard Oil's\" demands. I called their attention to the\r\ntape: \"They told me to throw over only 10,000 shares,\" I concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens!\" said Armstrong, the negotiating partner of Clark, Ward\r\n& Co., \"they are likely to follow it up with 90,000 more. They have it;\r\nat least they can demand it of us, and if they do we are ruined. What\r\ncan we do, Lawson? What _can_ we do?\"\r\n\r\nI pointed out that their only possible course was to lay the situation\r\nbefore the large shareholders involved, stating the absolute necessity\r\nof coming to \"Standard Oil's\" time, and to make their medicine a little\r\nmore palatable I added: \"Once you come to time I can induce my people, I\r\nbelieve, to make a public announcement that they will take the open\r\nmanagement and control of the Utah Company, and you know that will\r\nsurely make the stock jump--enough, perhaps, to offset what you people\r\nlose on the extra 50,000 shares you yield up.\"\r\n\r\nI advised them to the best of my ability as to their only way out. If I\r\nhad revealed to them that we had sold every share of the stock they were\r\nto turn over to us, it would have served no good purpose, for it would\r\nhave made business impossible between us, and a crash would have\r\noccurred which would have ruined Utah, inflicted destruction on their\r\nprice structure, and only enriched \"Standard Oil.\" When I concluded,\r\nthey started in to do as I had suggested, and the way they burnt up time\r\nand annihilated space was marvellous to behold. Though the thing was\r\nalmost a miracle, they met the condition within the time limit, and we\r\nhad turned over to us 150,000 shares of stock.\r\n\r\nThe moment Mr. Rogers saw the deal was a \"go\" all his hardness melted as\r\nthe snow upon the mountainsides under the April sun. Nothing could be\r\nsofter, kinder, and fairer. The blood had disappeared; the tiger was a\r\ngreat, purring house-cat, intent only on catching naughty rats and mice\r\nfor the good of the household. Why, he would do anything to help out\r\nthese good gentlemen; certainly, the world should know of his great\r\ninterest in the Utah properties, and as the millions of golden dollars\r\nclinked into his golden bucket the next day, the world did learn of the\r\ngreat value of Utah, for his private counsel was made president, and\r\ncertain other gentlemen who bear the uncounterfeitable \"Standard Oil\"\r\ntag were appointed as directors. There was a general jubilation--I had\r\nalmost said, a killing of the fatted calf; but that part of the ceremony\r\nhad been most ably attended to by Mr. Rogers in the preliminary stages\r\nof the entertainment.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--When this startling and cold-blooded-trick part of my\r\n     story was published in _Everybody's Magazine_, it astounded\r\n     the world, and my enemies took advantage of the fierce anger\r\n     which was aroused to call attention to my part, which they\r\n     attempted to show was as bad as that of Rogers. Right here I\r\n     wish to go on record: If I had been a human angel instead of\r\n     a stock-broker, actuated solely by a desire to do just\r\n     right, to do that which would work least harm to the\r\n     greatest number of innocents, and least good to the largest\r\n     number of tricksters, I should have done as I did.\r\n\r\n     AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLAWYER UNTERMYER DISCOVERS THE \"NIGGER\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this Utah episode because it shows phases of the\r\n\"System's\" methods never heretofore made public, just as episodes which\r\nare to follow in the narrative will develop other startling and\r\ningenious deviltries. But, before going on, the sequel to the Utah\r\naffair deserves a place in the story. A sequel there was, and my readers\r\nwill agree, I think, that it has a mordant humor quite its own. To-day,\r\nafter the years that have gone by, I cannot think of this tremendous\r\nbunco game, in spite of its cruel and tragic phases, without a laugh at\r\nthe manner in which the smart gentlemen who composed the Utah\r\nConsolidated crowd were \"outwitted.\" Bear in mind that Clark, Ward & Co.\r\nwere among the \"flyest\" operators in Wall Street's juggle factories.\r\nThey asked no odds of any one in shuffling and dealing their cards, and\r\nwith them was the eminent Samuel Untermyer, surely the head of his class\r\nof corporation counsellors, and himself a master in the fine arts of\r\ncopper financiering. On the conclusion of the deal, these gentlemen and\r\ntheir partners in Utah assumed all the airs and graces they conceived\r\nproper for associates of \"Standard Oil,\" and at once enlarged their\r\nhatbands and let out their waistcoats. Some of them, I believe, went so\r\nfar as to be measured for copper crowns. The stories they set afloat\r\nabout the richness of Utah, as proved by \"Standard Oil's\" determination\r\nto have its 150,000 shares, would have made the constructor of Aladdin's\r\npalace look to his laurels as a treasure-house creator, and the\r\nstockholders of the corporation felt so good over their prospects that\r\nin London and New York two large banquets were simultaneously given at\r\nwhich the prospective millionaires tossed cable congratulations at one\r\nanother across the Atlantic and toasted in vintage champagnes the\r\nbrilliant promoters who had worked such wonders. At these entertainments\r\nthere was no question but that Utah was destined to be the foundation\r\ncompany in the coming great copper consolidation.\r\n\r\nWith this roseate view Mr. Rogers did not entirely coincide. His\r\ndiagnosis of the situation had all that whichever-way-the-cat-jumps\r\nfrankness I had learned to look upon as characteristic of the man. He\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, this is the situation: We are in absolute control of the Utah\r\nproperty. If it were good we could do great things with it, but it's\r\nbad, very bad; there is nothing out there but a bunch of ore which is\r\nrich enough, but which cannot possibly last longer than six years, and\r\nthen--then there is nothing but a hole in the ground. Of course there is\r\na possibility of our finding other bunches, but with all the machinery\r\nin our hands it looks to me as though we could play a very safe game. If\r\nwe find things that will make the stock valuable, we can keep the good\r\nnews buried until we shake the price down and get whatever we want. If\r\nit is all bad, we can sell the stock and buy it in at big profits. I\r\nthink, on the whole, it is safe to call this deal completed and mark it\r\na success.\"\r\n\r\nWith this understanding we left it, and for some little time I paid no\r\nattention whatever to Utah. One day I was surprised to notice on the\r\ntape that the price of the stock was declining. I was puzzling over what\r\ncould have happened, when I received a sudden call from the Machiavelli\r\nof the New York Bar, Samuel Untermyer. The set glare of his eyes, the\r\nfervor of his hand-shake, told me that I had a volcano to deal with.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said he, \"something came up the other day that led me to\r\ninvestigate, and do you know, I have got to a point already where I can\r\nput my fingers on people, outside of any one connected with 'Standard\r\nOil,' who own over 200,000 shares of Utah. If this is so, how can Rogers\r\nand his crowd own the 150,000 shares they took away from us at millions\r\nbelow the market? It seems impossible, but it looks as though we had\r\nbeen buncoed--buncoed as no one outside a crazy-house was ever buncoed\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nThat steely imperturbability which is alternately the pride and pleasure\r\nof Mr. Untermyer's friends, the glittering surface of which it is said\r\nno cloud has ever shadowed or no gale disturbed, was fast losing its\r\ndistinction under the influence of the excitement that welled up in the\r\nheaving bosom of the eminent cross-examiner; and excitement and he were\r\nso remote, so studiously antagonistic, that I looked on and listened in\r\nwonder for the outcome. An interesting situation was evidently fast\r\ndeveloping, and to grasp its possibilities one should know the attitude\r\nof Mr. Rogers toward Mr. Untermyer. For this astute lawyer the \"Standard\r\nOil\" magnate has something akin to terrified admiration. Mr. Rogers has\r\nsaid many times to me and to others among his associates that there is\r\nbut one lawyer in the United States whose cross-examination on the\r\nwitness-stand could afford him anything but amusement and recreation;\r\nand this extraordinary exception is Samuel Untermyer. The bare thought\r\nof being subjected under oath to the remorseless questioning of this\r\nastute dissector and analyst of motives and actions brings him to the\r\nverge of rippling chills. And here was this legal Nemesis on the\r\nwar-path and headed directly for 26 Broadway.\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean, Lawson?\" His voice was in a court-and-jury key.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity was too good to miss. I could not help it. I said,\r\n\"Untermyer, you have another guess coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you refuse to tell me anything about it?\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you about it?\" said I. \"What could I possibly tell you about your\r\nown scheme? You flatter me; you are getting excited. Let me ask you a\r\nquestion, What do you say it means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say it means,\" he fairly yelled, \"that we have been\r\nbuncoed--swindled!\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is a fact,\" I said, \"you are the best man on earth to tackle\r\nsuch a proposition. Introducing swindlers to justice is your specialty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said he, \"let's talk it out. I don't see wherein you are in\r\nany way to blame, but I tell you if I find true what I now suspect,\r\nthere will be music in the copper world that will set copper investors\r\nby the ears.\"\r\n\r\nI saw there was no use trying to dodge the issue, and we entered into\r\nexecutive session. He had gathered most of the facts, he told me, and to\r\nascertain the balance, proposed at once to call a meeting of Utah\r\nConsolidated stockholders. Also he had men out examining the transfer\r\nagencies to find who got the shares of Utah delivered to Rogers.\r\n\r\nI said to him, \"What do you think has happened, Untermyer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you people have sold the bulk of that stock,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we have,\" I said; \"there is no crime in that, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No crime,\" said he, \"but it is a piece of dirty double-dealing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, suppose I admit it,\" said I, \"what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did you do it? Did you sell that stock after we delivered it to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a share,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Do you give me your word for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word, we didn't sell a share of that stock after you\r\ndelivered it to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you sell it?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Every share before we secured it of you.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the distinguished impassivity faded finally away and Samuel\r\nUntermyer was actually and absolutely flabbergasted. The sight of him\r\ndumfounded, confused, was too much for me. I laughed. It is seldom one\r\ngets the laugh on Mr. Untermyer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me you were short the whole bunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Short every share of it, and 10,000 besides,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And where do you stand now?\" he pursued.\r\n\r\n\"Still short of it, and before you can get fairly to work kicking up a\r\nrumpus I should not be surprised if we were short the whole capital\r\nstock. Rogers, as you know, does play a great game, that is, when he has\r\nall the cards, owns the table, the room it's in, and has control of the\r\ndoorkeeper.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of tense silence. Untermyer was making a noble\r\neffort to swallow his fury. I began to figure the degree of my\r\nresponsibility if he should burst a blood-vessel or have an apoplectic\r\nstroke. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, if I don't blow this thing to pieces and shake 26 Broadway to\r\nits foundations, I'm not Sam Untermyer.\"\r\n\r\nThe time had come to reason with the heated legal gentleman, and in\r\nplain language I proceeded to show him where he stood, the position of\r\nthe property, the public's relation to it, and his own duty to the\r\nclients whose money he had invested in it. Under the logic of my\r\nargument he cooled. He saw the net, and that he and his friends were\r\nabsolutely enmeshed. He even admitted that he and his friends had\r\nunknowingly aided in what had occurred and were mostly to blame for\r\ntheir present position; but while he acknowledged all this, he\r\nreiterated over and over again that in all his experience--and in Samuel\r\nUntermyer's professional position he has either prosecuted, defended, or\r\nhad an inquisitorial finger in every sword-swallowing, dissolving-view,\r\nfrenzied finance game that has been born or naturalized in Wall Street\r\nwithin the decade--he had never met the equal in high-handed bunco of\r\nthis deal in Utah.\r\n\r\nFinally he said: \"There's one thing I can do, if I cannot get even with\r\nRogers; and that is, I can 'fire' the present management of this\r\ncompany, and I'm going to do it now, this very minute, and incidentally\r\nI'm going to state what I think of them and the whole dirty business.\"\r\n\r\nI called up \"Standard Oil\" on the telephone and told what had happened.\r\nMr. Rogers said: \"Cool him down at any cost, but particularly try to\r\nshow him I had little to do with the deal; that it was largely the\r\noutgrowth of what the Clark-Ward people thrust upon us, and that I left\r\nthe details to you and the lawyers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I had visions of what would be the cost of making \"Coppers\" a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour Untermyer was back visibly relieved and glowing after his\r\nencounter. He had the resignations in his pocket, and he began joyously\r\nto detail the specific opprobriums he had cast upon the management. \"I\r\nshall put in an entirely new management,\" he proclaimed triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"You have positively made up your mind to that?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"You bet I have,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for a few minutes, then,\" I said; \"I want to give my brokers\r\norders to rip out 50,000 or 60,000 shares of Utah. Rogers and\r\nRockefeller would take me to task if I wasted a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there, Lawson,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not a minute,\" said I; \"you know the game well enough, Untermyer, to\r\nrealize that there are a few millions hanging very low on the boughs at\r\njust this second. I want to get my hat under them before you and your\r\nfriends have an opportunity to roll in your own hogsheads.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no time for diplomacy, and I set forth in plain, dog-eat-dog\r\nterms to Mr. Untermyer exactly where he was \"at,\" and that no one but\r\nhimself and his associates would be the sufferers by a public explosion.\r\nReluctantly he agreed with me that under no conditions must the\r\n\"Standard Oil\" management be changed, but he was bound to have one\r\nvictim to show.\r\n\r\n\"You have the resignations of the present board--why not put in new men,\r\nthe strongest 'Standard Oil' men you know?\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it,\" he said, \"but I'll throw out the present president, blame\r\nhim for all that's happened, but--whom shall I put in to replace him?\r\nHow about Rogers himself?\"\r\n\r\nKnowing Mr. Rogers' cross-purposes I was sure he would never become\r\nofficially responsible for the company; so I told Untermyer this was\r\nimpossible, but I continued: \"The next best man and the closest I know\r\nto Rogers is Broughton, his son-in-law. There's your president.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Broughton was elected president of the Utah company. The stock\r\nhas since dropped from 52 to 22, gone from 22 to 37-1/2, dropped to\r\n18-1/2, with frequent repetitions, and is now 43: and all the drops have\r\nbeen preceded by tremendous short selling, followed by stories of the\r\nabsolute worthlessness of the property; and all the rises, by\r\ntremendous buying and stories of the mine's fabulous richness. Some one\r\nhas made millions.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Oil\" is ever ready to forgive and forget those it has injured,\r\nbut it has power and place for those who have made it tremble. Its\r\nassociates to-day are often yesterday's enemies. As one looks back upon the\r\nUtah episode from over the divide, it helps accentuate its humor to\r\ncontrast the present attitudes of the parties engaged with those they then\r\nheld to one another. We now see the virtuously indignant Samuel Untermyer\r\nshoulder to shoulder with his wicked betrayer, Henry H. Rogers, whose\r\ncounsel he is against the original ally of the same Henry H. Rogers, Thomas\r\nW. Lawson, historian of \"Frenzied Finance.\" And the talented expert, most\r\ntrusted of \"Standard Oil\" mining emissaries--Broughton, whose unfavorable\r\nreport on Utah Consolidated was the instrument of the plundering of the\r\nClark-Ward-Untermyer contingent--elected president by Samuel Untermyer, has\r\nremained ever since at the head of the property he had pronounced\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDEGREES IN CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery profession has its social grades. Even crime is not without an\r\naristocracy. There are as many classes of crooks as there are things to\r\nsteal, and the more dangerous the theft, the more distinguished is the\r\ncriminal in the eyes of his professional brethren. In the thieving\r\nfraternity the burglar and the highwayman figure as important persons,\r\nfor do they not take their lives in their hands every time they \"pull\r\noff\" a trick? He who signs another man's name to a check requires fine\r\ndexterity to be successful and endangers his liberty for a long term, so\r\nthe forger is of high consequence. Pickpockets and sneak-thieves stake\r\nfreedom on the agility of their fingers and legs, and are the small fry\r\nof the fraternity, yet figure as legitimate practitioners. But the\r\nconfidence man, he who goes forth among rural communities disguised as a\r\nclergyman or doctor, and wheedles money out of some unsuspecting\r\nfellow-creature by means of the trust he has inspired, ranks low in the\r\nestimation of his plucky brethren of the jimmy and the black-jack. Force\r\nthey respect; stealth they despise. The burglar is frankly a burglar;\r\nthe confidence man conceals his plundering purpose under the aspect of\r\nrespectability. He is doubly a knave in that he pretends to be honest.\r\n\r\nThe Utah trick performed by the \"System,\" as described in my last\r\nchapter, was essentially a confidence operation. The men who executed it\r\nhad the reputation and appearance of honesty, and their victims were\r\nhypnotized into security by accepting standing in the community, great\r\nbusiness prestige, and enormous wealth as guarantees of individual\r\nprobity. The only capital employed in capturing three millions of \"made\r\ndollars\" and the control of a great corporation was respectability. I\r\ncontend, then, that the magnitude and success of the deal do not make it\r\nless despicable.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers will doubtless ask me why I so insistently repeat the\r\ndetails of the \"System's\" criminality, which for all purposes of\r\nargument have already been sufficiently established. My answer is that\r\nrepetition alone will impress people with the real character of the\r\nclass of individuals with whom I deal. The mass of Americans look upon\r\nthese men as great leaders, and regard their millions as monuments to\r\ntheir commercial genius. I am showing that this commercial genius is no\r\nbetter than a high talent, for financial jugglery, and that its\r\nsuccesses are achieved by a calculated disregard of the laws of the\r\ngame. The \"System's\" fortunes have been won by means of marked cards and\r\ncogged dice, crooked wheels and bribed umpires--in other words, by the\r\ncorruption of legislatures, the undermining of competitors, the evasion\r\nof railway rates, the wrongful manipulation of stocks, the perversion of\r\njustice, by intrigue, graft, and four play. Once the people realize\r\nthis, the \"System\" is doomed; and it is my purpose to demonstrate so\r\nclearly and forcibly the crimes of the past that the nation may be\r\naroused not only to prevent their repetition, but to crush their\r\nrascally perpetrators as they would so many reptiles. I shall so\r\nfamiliarize the people with the rights to which they are properly\r\nentitled and with the outrages committed in violation of them under the\r\nguise of legitimate commerce, that they will know them as they do the\r\ncommon facts of their daily lives. Let any \"System\" attempt to interfere\r\nbetween a man and his Bible, his meat and bread, and his proper\r\nallowance of sleep, and there would occur an explosion fierce enough to\r\nwipe the conspirators and their plots off the face of the earth; yet it\r\nis absolutely the fact that in the past our people have suffered\r\nunwittingly much fiercer wrongs than these would be, and far more vital\r\ninvasions of their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMR. ROGERS UNMASKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in Montana a great copper property known as the\r\nDaly-Haggin-Tevis group, the centre of which was the huge Anaconda mine\r\nwith its 1,200,000 shares. This is the mine that Marcus Daly induced the\r\nlate George Hearst to buy and develop for the marvellously successful\r\nsyndicate of California mining operators, composed of J. B. Haggin,\r\nnoted now the world over for his horses; Lloyd Tevis, an extraordinarily\r\nshrewd San Francisco financier; and Senator George Hearst, himself\r\nperhaps the greatest mining expert America has ever known. After Senator\r\nHearst's death his estate sold its holdings to European investors, who\r\nwith the other three owned the company at the time of which I am\r\nwriting. I had never in my copper-consolidation plans contemplated\r\nincluding this property, for the reason that the public I was operating\r\namong was not familiar with it. I did not care to put in jeopardy the\r\nsuccess of our venture by admitting any but mines of such well-known and\r\nunquestionable value that there could arise no possible doubt as to the\r\nsecurity of the investment. I was well along in my task of gathering in,\r\nthrough public-market manipulation and private negotiation, the shares\r\nof the several good Boston companies whose merits I myself knew about\r\nand had so carefully gone over with Mr. Rogers and Mr. Rockefeller, when\r\none day Mr. Rogers called me up on the telephone and requested that I\r\ncome to New York to see him. \"I have,\" he said, \"a very important matter\r\nto go over with you.\" I took the train and early next morning was at 26\r\nBroadway. As soon as we started in I was struck by a certain strangeness\r\nin his manner--an unusual impressiveness that indicated to me at once\r\nthat something was in the wind.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be the case. I was soon in possession of the information\r\nthat he and Mr. Rockefeller had been putting in a lot of work on the\r\ncopper business; that they had evolved some further schemes, and that\r\nnow the plans were so far along that I could not upset them, therefore\r\nthey proposed to let me in--all this in the pleasantest manner.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my quick inquiry as to what plans I had ever upset he waved\r\na chilling hand toward me. \"Don't start in looking for trouble,\" he\r\nsaid. \"There are certain things which cannot be done by a man who works\r\nas you do. From the very beginning you have insisted upon taking the\r\npublic into your confidence, with the result that they get large profits\r\nwhich otherwise would come to us. If you did your business as we do\r\nours--acted first and talked after, or, better still, did not talk at\r\nall--there would be no difference of opinion between us. Still, we\r\nrecognize that each man must do business in his own way, and we have let\r\nyou go ahead where it was possible.\" After a short pause he continued:\r\n\r\n\"While you were getting the Boston companies in shape I unearthed\r\nanother situation which almost seemed as though it were made to order\r\nfor us. What do you know of the Anaconda Company?\"\r\n\r\nThe way he asked this question in one of his cross-bred,\r\ncat-purring-and-fox-bark tones which I had seen him work on others, and\r\nwhich I had observed always denoted a perfect knowledge of your answer\r\nto his question before you had it, did not help my guessing any.\r\n\r\nI told him I knew nothing more than that there was such a company with\r\nstock dealt in on the English and our markets.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than that?\" And he looked at me quizzically. \"Have you\r\nbeen watching the stock's actions in the market?\"\r\n\r\nIn a second it flashed over me that Anaconda had been quite active of\r\nlate, that is, had been largely traded in without attracting much\r\nattention, although the price had been steadily advancing.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you boasted you could read the tape, Lawson?\" he went on,\r\n\"and that nothing could be happening in a field you were interested in\r\nwithout your smelling it out? When I tell you Mr. Rockefeller and myself\r\nhave bought control of the biggest copper property in the world,\r\nmeasured either by the number of shares and their selling price or by\r\nproduction, without your even suspecting it, much less the public's\r\njumping in and running up the price on us, you can see there is\r\nsomething in our quiet way of doing things compared with your public\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Rogers; I have never contended that there were as many\r\ndollars in my way of doing things as in yours--as many dollars for\r\n_us_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said he, \"the public are about ready to invest in the first\r\nsection of our new consolidated company, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sitting up nights to see that they get a place in line the minute we\r\nscatter our first handbills,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are we ready to put our things together? Have we got the\r\nnecessary companies to meet the ideas you have been educating the public\r\ninto?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have things in such shape that we can whip a $75,000,000 or a\r\n$100,000,000 company up for public subscription in a very few days, if\r\nyou give the word.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers leaned toward me and said in his most decisive and imperious\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n\"Very well; I have plans all shaped up which will allow us to offer the\r\nfirst section, but not made up as we first arranged. Mr. Rockefeller and\r\nmyself have decided to put entirely new companies in the first section,\r\nand to reserve the Butte and the Montana and other companies you have\r\nbeen working on for the second section.\"\r\n\r\nThe blow had fallen. My head swam. Visions of Clark, Ward, Untermyer,\r\nUtah, and others I had seen on the rack writhed fearfully across the\r\nstage of memory. Here I was loaded with Butte, Montana, and other stocks\r\nwhich I had felt as certain were to go into the first section as one can\r\nfeel in regard to a thing which seems in one's own control. On my public\r\nand private assurances as the accredited agent of Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller and \"Standard Oil,\" my friends and following had large\r\namounts of money in the same securities. The market was booming on what\r\nI had proclaimed was to happen, and here an absolutely new condition was\r\nbeing imposed, a condition which gave all my assertions the lie, which\r\ndiscredited me, and would, I felt sure, precipitate a terrible disaster.\r\nInevitably the copper public would be dazed, would be shaken; a reaction\r\nwould follow which would bring on a panic and a destruction of values\r\nimpossible to measure. In it all, I should be left alone to bear the\r\nbrunt of the storm of ruin, wrath, and denunciation as the result of\r\nwhat must seem base trickery to those who had accepted my\r\nrepresentations. I tried to pull myself together, for I felt Mr. Rogers'\r\nkeen eyes burning into the back of my head, appraising the effect of his\r\nwords and measuring the degree of my numb terror. He saw, in spite of\r\nall my efforts to appear calm, that I knew I had been given a knock-out\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nAs in a dream I inquired what companies it had been decided should go\r\ninto the first section.\r\n\r\n\"Anaconda, Washoe, Colorado, and all the big timber lands, coal-mines,\r\nbanks, stores, and other Montana properties that go to make up the\r\nDaly-Haggin-Tevis properties,\" he replied crisply.\r\n\r\nI found my numb inertia melting in a fierce anger. I jumped up. I raised\r\nmy voice:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, do you mean to tell me that Mr. Rockefeller and yourself\r\nhave deliberately decided to take advantage of the situation I have\r\nmade--the situation I have not only made but put myself into--to try to\r\nsell to the investors of this country other property than that I have\r\npromised them they were to have? You cannot mean that--you surely\r\ncannot, for you and all your 'Standard Oil,' even though you were many\r\ntimes bigger than you are, would never have dared to tell it to me face\r\nto face.\"\r\n\r\nI was boiling over--becoming literally frenzied at the picture unrolling\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nNow it was Mr. Rogers' turn to be aroused. His voice quivered with\r\nintensity and his fist came down on his desk with a force that shook the\r\ninkstand. It flashed into my brain that this anger was assumed to cow\r\nme, and I tried to look through his eyes on to his mind tablets back of\r\nthem, and read what was there recorded. The gaze that met mine was\r\npolished steel ice coated, off which my glances slipped and slid. I\r\ndropped into my chair.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of all that's sensible, Lawson, hear me out and quit acting\r\nlike a child.\" He stopped a second and then went on impressively. \"In\r\nlooking over the copper field I discovered a number of things you failed\r\nto see. First, that Haggin and Tevis, who own Anaconda with Marcus Daly,\r\nhave grown so wealthy that they have left the management of their\r\nMontana copper and silver properties entirely to Daly, and he has been\r\ncoddling the mines along, saying nothing about their real worth and\r\nquietly passing by the richest parts, awaiting the day when he could buy\r\nhis partners out. Shortly after you let it be known that we were to go\r\ninto 'Coppers,' Daly came to me to talk things over, and it took me only\r\na short time to get under his waistcoat and find just what he had out\r\nthere, and it took me still less time to decide that he offered\r\nsomething a little better than anything we had yet turned up. These\r\nproperties, which we can secure for $24,000,000, which will carry with\r\nthem the majority of the 1,200,000 shares of Anaconda, alone are worth\r\n$75,000,000, and with the addition of the Colorado, Washoe, and Parrott,\r\nwhich he recommends that we buy and which he is in a way to secure for\r\nus at a bargain, will cost not over $15,000,000. So it came right down\r\nto this: We could trade with Daly immediately, while if we waited until\r\nthe first section was out to the public the inevitable appreciation of\r\nAnaconda stock in the market would alone make it impossible; for even if\r\nDaly was willing to go in with us, Haggin and Tevis would not let him at\r\nanything like the prices he now names. It seemed best to take action at\r\nonce, so we closed with him; and we have also just closed with the\r\nWashoe and Colorado, and we want you to secure the Parrott. Under these\r\ncircumstances, could we do otherwise than we have done?\"\r\n\r\nHis argument seemed conclusive. It looked so fair and unanswerable that\r\nI could not disguise from him that my fears had fled. I was immensely\r\nrelieved. My fight oozed; I became as pliable as any of the brittle\r\nclay which he daily kneaded for each shaping with his applications of\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\"What are your plans, Mr. Rogers?\" I asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\"This is what we thought would be the thing to do if you agreed, Lawson,\r\nfor, of course, you are, after all, the one who must decide. First, you\r\nshall go over everything we have done, and if you feel sure we have\r\nproperty worth at least, at the hardest kind of hard-pan prices,\r\n$75,000,000, we want to whoop up the country to the very top notch of\r\nexpectation, and while doing so begin to hint that there are to be three\r\nor four sections, and that the first one will embrace Anaconda,\r\nColorado, Washoe, Parrott, and lots of other unnamed things. Then our\r\nidea was to offer the $75,000,000 by public subscription, and by using\r\nevery dollar we receive for it to support it in the market, to make it\r\nsell afterward under all conditions at a big premium over cost, so that\r\nevery one would make big profits, and so, consequently, by the time the\r\nsecond section came along, the demand for subscriptions would be\r\nunprecedented. We could continue this until all the good 'Coppers' were\r\nin our company, and then our consolidation would be a prodigious\r\nsuccess, just as you outlined at the start. There cannot possibly be any\r\nloss to any one; in fact, success is so assured that William\r\nRockefeller, Daly, Stillman, and all the others who will be associated\r\nwith us, do not propose to sell a share of their stock, but, on the\r\ncontrary, will go along with us to the finish. So good does it look to\r\nus that I feel it will really beat out Standard Oil itself as a\r\nmoney-maker, and you must remember that whatever else they may say about\r\nStandard Oil, no one who has ever owned a share has lost money; on the\r\ncontrary, every one has made large profits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\"EXTRACT EVERY DOLLAR\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Standard Oil's\" arguments always are absolutely flawless, and this was\r\none of their best. I was fast becoming imbued with the wisdom of the\r\nplan which Mr. Rogers was revealing so adroitly, and began secretly to\r\nwonder if after all I was not a novice in such business.\r\n\r\nUnerringly Mr. Rogers followed my thoughts. He piled Pelions of better\r\nthings on Ossas of good ones. Surely it was after watching some parallel\r\nhoodwinking put through by a remote ancestor of \"Standard Oil\" that Puck\r\nenunciated his famous dictum, \"What fools these mortals be.\" I fell in\r\nlike the veriest tyro--hypnotized and happy.\r\n\r\n\"How much of this first section do you figure, Mr. Rogers, that we are\r\nto give to the public?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"We, Mr. Rockefeller and myself, have carefully considered this phase of\r\nit, and as we all want to retain as much as possible of the stock, we\r\nwould not sell over $5,000,000 to the public.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you do this?\" I asked. \"If the public know 'Standard Oil' is\r\nretaining nearly all the stock they will sour on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave that to us,\" he said, knowingly. \"We can iron this out so easily\r\nyou need not give it another thought, for no one can have any possible\r\nrights in the matter until he has been allotted stock, and as all those\r\nwho come in are to have big profits from the start, they will raise no\r\nobjection to anything we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, if you think it's wise. You know,\" I responded; \"but who\r\nwill be in this besides ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one of us--Stillman, Daly, Olcott, Flower, Morgan, all who can be\r\nof use to us will have to be let in on some of the ground floors. The\r\nfoundation profits, as we agreed under the old plan, will be twenty-five\r\nper cent. to you, seventy-five per cent. to us. After that we will\r\njointly take care of those we let in. Is that all right?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Henry H. Rogers sets out to batter down an antagonist he is as\r\nfierce as an eagle foraging for her young; victorious, he is as amiable\r\nand generous as a salesman who has unloaded on a customer a big cargo of\r\ndamaged goods. Anything the victim wants he can have by simply naming\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFascinated by his mastery of the subject and the obvious completeness of\r\nhis plans, I could only continue to assent. He went on:\r\n\r\n\"There's another section of the subject we must get at now, Lawson, and\r\ndecide on once and for all. You seem to have made no provisions for the\r\nmost important end of the whole business, the selling end. What is your\r\nidea as to how we shall control the selling end?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had given that little thought, Mr. Rogers,\" I replied. \"I believe\r\nthat easily takes care of itself. The demand is always greater than the\r\nsupply. We shall have the metal to sell, the world will be more anxious\r\nto buy than we to sell: what more can be necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said the master brain of the greatest and most successful\r\ncommercial enterprise in the world, \"you know the stock-market, but you\r\ndon't know the first principle of working to advantage a great business\r\nin which you absolutely control the production. The novice assumes that\r\nconsumption when it is greater than production makes the price, but this\r\nis one of the many time-worn sophistries of business. Do you suppose\r\nStandard Oil has built itself up to where it is and made the money it\r\nhas simply because there were always more lamps than we had oil? If you\r\ndo, you are in dense ignorance of the foundation requisite for great\r\nsuccess. As the world goes to-day, the prices of necessities and\r\nluxuries are fixed and should be fixed by the man who controls both the\r\nselling and the producing end, for there is a greater profit to be had\r\nby supply to regulated demand and demand to regulated supply than from a\r\ncharge made and regulated by supply and demand. Standard Oil gets\r\nto-day and has always since its birth got its enormous profit from its\r\n'regulation' department. Production yields it a proper profit and by\r\nsupplying legitimate demands it earns other fair profits, but its big\r\ngains come from so adjusting one to the other that there can be no such\r\nthing as competition. Do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree that is not my end, Mr. Rogers, though in a general way I know\r\nabout railroad rebates, steamship comebacks, and such things; but I\r\ndon't see how they are required in our copper business, where the demand\r\nis of such proportions that the producer sets the price and makes a\r\nprofit away above what may be gained in other business enterprises.\r\nSurely no one would ask larger gains than are naturally made out of\r\ncopper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" responded Mr. Rogers with oracular emphasis, \"that is where\r\nyour business education is flawed. No man has done his business properly\r\nwho has missed a single dollar he could have secured in the doing of it.\r\nI do not think a fair judge would find me guilty of avarice, either in\r\nbusiness or in the manner of my living, and yet I am made fairly\r\nmiserable if I discover that, in any business I do, I have not extracted\r\nevery dollar possible. It is one of the first principles Mr. Rockefeller\r\ntaught me; it is one he has inculcated in every 'Standard Oil' man,\r\nuntil to-day it is a religion with us all.\"\r\n\r\nThere you have it--the fundamental precept of the gospel of greed. \"What\r\nmust ye do to be rich? Extract every dollar.\" How the formula explains\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" and how completely it reveals the Rockefeller attitude\r\nof mind! Greed crystallized into a practice, dignified into a principle,\r\nconsecrated into a religion and become a fanaticism. But, mind you, not\r\nthe dross, but the rule; not profit, but precedent. Money no object, but\r\nour laws must be kept. Shylock's god is \"Standard Oil's.\" The ravenous\r\nlust for gold that possesses these men is not an appetite, but a fever.\r\nIn them it is the craving of the tiger for blood. Gorged and glutted\r\nwith riches, their millions piled into the hundreds, masters of the\r\nrevenues of empires, still they are as the daughters of the\r\nhorse-leech.\r\n\r\nOnce in Ogreland there was a giant, larger and fiercer than any of his\r\nfellows, and it was the habit of this monster to compel the inhabitants\r\nof the territory which he ruled to render him every evening a tribute of\r\nhuman hearts. At sundown he would come out of his castle and seat\r\nhimself in a great chair in front of the huge iron gate, and his vassals\r\nwould lay at his feet the dripping sacks of hearts for which they had\r\nscoured the land. \"How many have you brought me to-day, my merry men?\"\r\nhe would say as he weighed the sacks in his mighty fingers. \"Are they\r\nlarge and juicy?\" How they came or whence, he cared not at all; the\r\nscreams of the unfortunates whose hearts were torn from their breasts he\r\nneither heard nor thought of; hearts he must have, and if people were\r\nkilled, so much the worse for them. But the ogre _ate_ all the human\r\nhearts his vassals gathered for him; he lived on them and grew greater\r\nand lustier, for they were the food his great frame required for its\r\nsustenance, and he never had all he really wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Oil\" in our life to-day plays the rôle of this mythological\r\ngiant, forcing its tribute of dollars from the people, indifferent to\r\nthe blood and tears in which they are soaked, oblivious of the cries of\r\nthe victims from whom they have been dragged; but, unlike the giant,\r\n_\"Standard Oil\" does not need this tribute to sustain its life, nor to\r\nmake richer its blood_.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr. Rogers, who triumphantly proceeded with his plot:\r\n\r\n\"Let me show you, Lawson, how you have overlooked the best part of the\r\ncopper business. We have found that for years Lewisohn Brothers have had\r\na double-clamped and riveted contract with at least half the best\r\nproducing mines in the country to sell their output, and they have grown\r\nvery wealthy. As near as we can make it, they have made at least fifty\r\nmillions in one way or another in the last ten or twelve years. First,\r\nthey have had a big profit as their commission for selling; next, big\r\ninterest out of the advances they make to companies while their output\r\nis being sold; now, they actually control the copper market of the\r\nworld. Think of it, Lawson, for a few seconds, and the possibilities\r\nwill loom up to you. You can buy or sell any number of millions of\r\npounds in futures or actual deliveries. Suppose a man controlling the\r\nselling of three or four hundred million pounds a year should knock the\r\nprice to, say, ten cents, sell to himself the year's output of all the\r\nmines he controls and then lift the price to, say, twenty cents. He\r\nwould have a sure profit, with absolutely no risk, of thirty to forty\r\nmillions of dollars. If he should sell the next year's output short at\r\ntwenty and drop the price back to ten, he would have another thirty or\r\nforty millions. Wouldn't he? Then if, before he broke the price, he sold\r\ncopper mining stocks short, and if, before advancing the price, he\r\ncovered and loaded up with them, he could easily make an additional\r\nthirty or forty millions. Think it over, and you will agree with me that\r\nthe possibilities are far beyond those of oil, and perhaps at the same\r\ntime you can account for the violent fluctuations in copper stocks and\r\nthe price of the metal during recent years. A man in such position could\r\nabsolutely _dictate_ to all new mines whose selling agency he could\r\nsecure under long-term contracts. When their stocks were up, he could\r\npinch them to the edge of bankruptcy by refusing to sell their metal or\r\nadvance them the cash they needed for operation. Now, don't you agree\r\nwith me that you overlooked one of the most important branches of the\r\ncopper business when you made no provision for taking in the selling\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\nAgain it crept into my mind that in comparison with the diabolic\r\nastuteness of this man, such knowledge and experience of business as I\r\nhad gathered were as those of the primary student to the post-graduate\r\nscholar's. Again, there was no quarreling with his logic or his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\"It is common knowledge in Boston,\" I replied, \"that copper commissions\r\non the surface and below constitute as soft graft as any one would ask\r\nfor, but no one suspected the possibilities you outline. Do you actually\r\nmean to say that that is the way the business has been conducted in the\r\npast?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers lowered his voice confidentially:\r\n\r\n\"I can only tell you, Lawson, that we have dug up some queer doings\r\nduring our investigation, and I think I can put my finger on a great\r\nmany millions of dollars now in the hands of certain mine officers\r\nwhich could be recovered by the different companies they have been\r\nacting as trustees of. It would be quite an eye-opener to some of your\r\npious Bostonians to know that the controlling officials of several mines\r\nare silent partners in some of the big selling agencies.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pregnant interval of silence. Perhaps the expression of my\r\nface suggested the thronging thoughts which seethed through my head as I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"But surely, Mr. Rogers, that's off our beat. We shall make money enough\r\nalong our lines without getting into that kind of a game.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers swung his chair half round and looked straight at me. For a\r\nlong second he stared--sitting half upright, his long, fine hands\r\nclasping the arms of the chair with a clutch like steel. He said not a\r\nword. Then he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Lawson, we have no need for such methods in our affairs. But\r\nit is a duty we owe investors and ourselves not to conduct this business\r\nin a way that will encourage others to continue doing it along the old\r\nlines.\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned at me as much as to say (only he never uses such\r\nexpressions), \"Oh, but you do make me tired,\" as he always did when I,\r\nwith a serious face, would ask him, as I often did: \"How is it, Mr.\r\nRogers, that young John D. can make such a success of his\r\nSunday-School-Class Trust, and at the same time of his father's oil and\r\ninvestment business?\" In business hours Mr. Rogers taboos frivolity.\r\n\r\nThe neophyte in crime, being initiated into the mysteries of the\r\nprofession by some able Fagin, gets his instruction by degrees. Great\r\ncare is taken that he shall not realize too soon the depravity he is to\r\npractise, lest, appalled by the hideousness of it, he might jump the\r\ntrack, and along with each advance in knowledge goes a picture\r\nrepresenting the ease of the life and the lordly rewards and pleasant\r\nadventures of the \"industry.\" From the remote perspective of to-day very\r\nsimilar seems to have been the process in this most momentous\r\nconversation between Mr. Rogers and myself. The apprentice at the knees\r\nof the master was being gently and gradually admitted into the secrets\r\nof the calling--financial highwaymanry. At the moment, however, it\r\nnever entered my thoughts to imagine myself other than a favorite\r\nlieutenant gathering the garnered wisdom of a great general of commerce.\r\n\r\nSo when Mr. Rogers shifted bobbins in his shuttle and agreeably and\r\nnaturally wove fancy patterns into the woof of our conversation, I\r\nsuspected no sinister motive. Indeed, in reply to his kindly queries, I\r\nwas delighted to tell him how well I was getting along with Butte,\r\nMontana, and the other stocks that I had been dealing in, and how deeply\r\ninterested all the country was in our plans. We must have been fully\r\nhalf an hour discussing the degree to which the craze for \"Coppers\" had\r\nspread over all America and had affected even Europe, and it was\r\npleasant to realize his interest in my own personal well-being. Then,\r\nsuddenly, as the thread on a bobbin runs out, he paused and shifted to\r\nthe old subject--just as if a new phase of it had occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\"To come back, Lawson, to Lewisohn Brothers. We must buy that concern,\r\nand at once. Had you best do it or we?\"\r\n\r\nOur pleasant talk had restored my mind to its normal alertness, and I\r\ngrasped at once the significance of the switch.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I could begin to do as well as you on a trade of that\r\nkind, Mr. Rogers,\" I answered, off the reel, \"for I don't suppose they\r\nwill be anxious to sell, will they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anxious?\" he replied, as quick as a chipmunk; \"about as anxious as\r\nApollo to have one of his front teeth pulled! But they will sell, and at\r\nmy price, too. I think I know just where they stand, and when they know\r\nI know it, I don't believe they will be long in seeing it my way, for I\r\nshall show them what coming in with us means, and just what refusing my\r\noffer means, too!\"\r\n\r\nClick! His jaws came together.\r\n\r\n\"These are my plans,\" he continued. \"They have all the money they want,\r\nand such a large European and American following that nothing could be\r\naccomplished by a financial squeeze, even if we resorted to that form of\r\npressure; and they are very bright men. Leonard Lewisohn, head of the\r\nfirm, is second to no man in America as a business man, which means he\r\nwill not hanker for a fight with us; and when I show him we will buy, if\r\nnecessary, the control of all the companies they represent, he will see\r\nthe absolute futility of opposing us. I have it right from the inside of\r\nhis own concern that Lewisohn Brothers have on hand a little over five\r\nmillions cash and its equivalent, and that they consider the good-will\r\nand business of the firm worth ten to twelve millions more, which is\r\nfair enough, for their direct earnings must be a million and a quarter\r\nto a million and a half a year. Now here is what I propose offering\r\nthem, and no more: We will incorporate the firm into a new selling\r\ncompany, which will have irrevocable contracts not only with our\r\nconsolidated companies but with everything that we can influence, and\r\nthe capital will be just the cash on hand, say five millions, we to take\r\nfifty-one per cent. of the stock and give them forty-nine. I will\r\nundertake to show them that their forty-nine will be more valuable under\r\nthose conditions than the whole is now.\"\r\n\r\nThis is where I sat up amazed. \"But, Mr.--,\" I gasped.\r\n\r\nI remember reading somewhere that New York's infamous Boss Tweed, at the\r\nzenith of his extraordinary corrupt career, actually began negotiations\r\nwith a syndicate composed of his friends to sell them the New York City\r\nHall on a long-time note. When some curious heelers asked where the city\r\nfathers should conduct the affairs of the metropolis, he beamed on them\r\nin a paternal way as he explained: \"Oh, a detail of the sale will be a\r\nhundred years' lease back to the city at a rental which will give us\r\nenough each five years to pay the purchase price.\"\r\n\r\nAbsurd, you say. Not so far-fetched as you may think, if you will\r\nremember the conditions under which the National City--the \"Standard\r\nOil\" Bank--acquired New York's old Custom House on Wall Street. They\r\nbought it from the United States Government, credited the purchase price\r\nto Uncle Sam on their books, then rented it for a good round price to\r\nthe Government, whose new Custom House was not ready for occupancy, and\r\nbecause it remained in Uncle Sam's possession, evaded municipal taxation\r\non the investment. They got the property absolutely without paying a\r\ncent, and have ever since collected a splendid interest on the million\r\nthey did not invest.\r\n\r\nBut this deal which Mr. Rogers outlined to me seemed to go both of these\r\ntransactions a point or two better, inasmuch as neither of the parties\r\nwere corrupt city or government officials, but merely private citizens\r\nin a country where all are free and equal, and where the Constitution\r\nguarantees that no man's property shall be taken from him without due\r\nprocess of law.\r\n\r\nBefore I could get my breath, Mr. Rogers, as if he divined my thought,\r\nquietly said:\r\n\r\n\"One of the inducements I offer will be to allow them to reinvest the\r\nmoney we pay them in the new consolidated company's stock, at a good big\r\nadvance over what it will cost us.\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much. I roared and roared, and even he had to laugh as he\r\nquietly remarked: \"I said you would find we had done better for you than\r\nyou could do for yourself, Lawson, for you must remember you are in on\r\nthis at actual cost.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped laughing. \"How is that? I thought you intended the new copper\r\ncompany to have the fifty-one per cent. of the selling company?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with something akin to disgust. Then his voice changed,\r\nand he let me have it straight from the shoulder:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, do you really intend that this whole copper business shall be a\r\ncharitable affair? If you do, just count us out right here. We are\r\nwilling to accede to a lot of your ideas, but there is a line we must\r\nrefuse to cross even to please you. This fifty-one per cent. of the\r\nselling company is to be owned by all of our friends, and it is one of\r\nthe things we must use as a sop to Daly, Stillman, Morgan, and the rest,\r\nto make them enthusiastic on our main scheme, and it will not come under\r\nour general arrangements of seventy-five and twenty-five per cent. It is\r\none of the things I want you to leave entirely to Mr. Rockefeller and\r\nmyself, and you can depend upon it we will do the right thing. All the\r\nstock is to be pooled in our hands for a long term of years, so you can\r\nsay to the public that its operations will be in favor of the\r\nconsolidated company.\"\r\n\r\nThere you will note was the second explosive point in our conversation.\r\nI was too much concerned at the moment to take in all his words implied\r\nor to appreciate the fine dexterity with which a difficult situation was\r\nbeing handled. These decisive sentences were cracked off quick, sharp,\r\nemphatic, like the snapping of a bunch of firecrackers. I began a \"But,\r\nMr. Rogers,\" when he interrupted, and his words came stern, aggressive:\r\n\r\n\"Is it satisfactory to you or not? I am half beginning to think you are\r\ncrowding this good thing we have in copper a bit too much. I simply ask\r\nnow, Is this satisfactory to you? Do you leave it to us, or not? But\r\nwhether you do or not, this particular part does not go to the public in\r\nany way.\"\r\n\r\nHe really showed a heap of irritation, and even now I think a little of\r\nit was genuine anger. It came over me that perhaps I _was_ overcrowding\r\nit and treating the whole copper enterprise too much as if it were my\r\npersonal property; for here was something I had had nothing to do with,\r\nthe setting out, pruning, and gathering the fruit from, this particular\r\nplum-tree, and so I answered without any hesitation:\r\n\r\n\"It is you, I think, Mr. Rogers, who are a little unreasonable in not\r\ngiving me a chance to tell you how I look at it. Yes, it is perfectly\r\nsatisfactory. I will leave it entirely to you and Mr. Rockefeller.\r\nWhatever you do will be all right.\"\r\n\r\nAt once Mr. Rogers' expression changed. He looked relieved, making no\r\nattempt to disguise the fact that he had discharged a troublesome duty.\r\n\"That is the way to look at it, Lawson,\" he said. \"You'll not suffer, I\r\npromise you.\"\r\n\r\nMeditating over the conversation afterward, I realized how delicate his\r\ntask really had been, and how well he had performed it. It had been to\r\nsettle this matter and to rearrange our copper plans that he had\r\nsummoned me to New York, and if I had proved refractory I can see he\r\nwould have been badly snagged in his negotiations with the Lewisohns. If\r\nthere had been a trace of dissension in our camp, that firm would never\r\nhave surrendered their great business on such terms as Rogers proposed\r\nto exact.\r\n\r\nThis is as good a place as elsewhere to tell exactly how fair and just\r\nMr. Rogers proved himself in the cutting of this particular melon, and\r\nto explain why he had been at such pains to have me leave it entirely to\r\nhis and Mr. Rockefeller's generosity. The fifty-one per cent. of the\r\nsales company amounted in hundred-dollar shares to 26,000 ($2,600,000).\r\nIf I had insisted upon the arrangement then in force my share would have\r\nbeen 6,500 shares ($650,000), which to-day are worth a fabulous figure.\r\nFor some time after this I heard nothing about the matter and was in\r\ncomplete ignorance of what my portion was until one day Mr. Rogers said\r\nin an offhand way: \"By the way, Lawson, you can send me a check for your\r\nallotment of the selling company's stock, 250 shares.\" Before I got a\r\nchance to interpose a word he said: \"We had to divide that up among a\r\ngreat many, or there would have been a good deal of hard feeling, but,\r\nafter all, it's only a side-show and does not amount to anything when\r\nyou consider our real plans.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, carefully chosen for that very reason, our affairs were\r\nswimming along so magnificently and my own profits were so great, that I\r\nhad not the heart to make any serious objection. I let the matter go\r\nwith an inward resolution that at the first convenient moment I would\r\nslip out of the selling company. Sure enough, shortly afterward Mr.\r\nRogers said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, I do wish we could get in that selling company's stock from the\r\ndifferent holders.\" He did not actually say he was buying it in for the\r\nAmalgamated Copper Company, but he desired that I infer it. I snapped\r\nhim up:\r\n\r\n\"All right. You can have mine, Mr. Rogers,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"At what price?\" And I think he thought that he would be compelled to do\r\nsome trading.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, about cost and interest,\" said I; and the thing was done. I\r\nafterward learned that he had treated every one in much the same way,\r\nand that he and Mr. William Rockefeller practically had it all. They\r\nhave it to-day, just as they and John D. Rockefeller, and possibly one\r\nor two others in \"Standard Oil,\" have appropriated all the inner\r\ncompanies of \"Standard Oil\" where the real melons are cut--the secret\r\nrebates and all the other under-the-rose profits--while they are so\r\nindustrious in their unloading of the stock of the main company,\r\nStandard Oil, that the last annual report showed that the list of\r\noutside stockholders numbers 4,100, this too at a time when 26 Broadway\r\nsits up nights to disseminate the impression that the Rockefellers and\r\nRogers own it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BITERS BIT\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see and judge actions aright one must have them in perspective. As\r\nthe Celt remarked, \"You can get the best view of your life after you're\r\ndead.\" Looking back on the performances of this period, I myself am\r\namazed at their monstrous audacity. Remote from common experience, their\r\nextravagance suggests unreality. Here were the master of the greatest\r\nbusiness the world has ever known, and I, a mere captain of his forces,\r\nwithout even a by-your-leave, calmly carving up a big commercial\r\nenterprise, the property of other men who had spent the days of their\r\nlives in creating it; and these men whose institution was thus being\r\nravished were not children, idiots, or aged dolts, but able merchants\r\nrenowned the world over for their shrewdness and success. The one phase\r\nof the contemplated operation which occurred to neither of us as worth\r\ndiscussing was the possibility of not securing the property. This\r\ntransaction demonstrates the despotism of the \"System,\" the extent of\r\nits rapacity, and its arrogant disregard of all laws and rights, human\r\nor divine, in the enforcement of its exactions. And it was but one of a\r\nhundred similar transactions.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Rogers and myself parted, I had definite instructions: First,\r\nto begin to teach the public to look for new things in the first\r\nsection; second, to overcome the objections of the holders of Butte &\r\nBoston and Boston & Montana, and other Boston stocks to being in the\r\nsecond section of the consolidation; third, to purchase the majority of\r\nthe Parrott Company's stock; fourth, to see that the public kept away\r\nfrom Anaconda in the market for the time being.\r\n\r\nWhile the minor details of these plans were being mapped out, I had let\r\nmy mind run over the market situation of Anaconda stock, and had arrived\r\nat certain conclusions which I determined to test forthwith. So I said:\r\n\r\n\"Some one, Mr. Rogers, must have bought lots of Anaconda while you have\r\nbeen working this plan out--I mean lots outside of that which is going\r\ninto the new company--and I should like to know if I'm in on any part of\r\nwhat may have been gathered in?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes focused me with a cold stare which told me even before he spoke\r\nthat I had better have kept my suspicions to myself.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of no one putting you in on any Anaconda,\" he said\r\nsarcastically. \"You have not given any one any orders, have you, nor\r\nsent any one your check to pay for any, have you?\"\r\n\r\nI was nettled at his tone. \"That is all I wanted to know,\" I answered.\r\n\"Of course, Anaconda will have a still bigger rise, and if we have all\r\nwe care to buy for the new company, no one will object to my telling the\r\npublic what a good thing it is and putting them aboard now.\"\r\n\r\nI was on perilous ground. He gave me an ugly glare which I knew meant\r\nreal danger as he slowly said: \"I think, Lawson, you have done all that\r\nis necessary for you to do for the public in letting them in on the\r\nthings you already have, and for some time any one who interferes with\r\nthe market on Anaconda stock, which I consider fairly belongs to Mr.\r\nRockefeller and myself, will not find his investment a profitable one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well and good, Mr. Rogers,\" I answered. \"If you consider the market\r\nyours, I will not interfere, but I wanted to know just how it stood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know now, and I shall expect you not only to keep out of it, but to\r\nsee that it is handled in such a manner that all others stay out--all\r\nothers except sellers,\" which meant that not only was no one to get any\r\nof the benefits on this stock, but that innocent holders were to be\r\nenticed into selling, that \"Standard Oil\" might buy before the real rise\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nAs I write these sentences I marvel at my patience, and my blood\r\ntingles with the thought of how, if the opportunity were again mine, I\r\nshould reply to such an imperious mandate. If men said and did at the\r\ncrucial moment all the wise, strong things that occur to them afterward,\r\nthis would be a different world. The brave and scornful words I should\r\nhave uttered I choked back, and, as countless others had done before me,\r\nI bowed my head and--submitted. Conscience and honesty slunk sadly into\r\nthe background as I flaunted off on the arms of policy and discretion,\r\npirouetting to the jingling music of golden shekels.\r\n\r\nGreat fortunes are seldom achieved without sacrifice of morals--or at\r\nleast of pride--and ambition makes meaner cowards of us than conscience.\r\nThen and there I might have made a martyr of myself by threatening an\r\nexposure of the whole bad scheme and defying \"Standard Oil\" to do its\r\nworst; but martyrs seldom give themselves to the flames, and looking\r\nback dispassionately from the vantage-ground of the present, I doubt\r\nseriously if by denouncing the conspiracy I should have done more than\r\ndiscredit myself.\r\n\r\nThe interview ended, I returned to Boston and at once began the\r\nexecution of the new plans, the remoulding of the public and the\r\npurchase of the Parrott mine.\r\n\r\nParrott was an active mine earning a large revenue and with something\r\nover 200,000 shares of capital stock. For the purpose of Mr. Rogers'\r\nplan its inclusion was essential, for it was well known and helped cover\r\nup the inflation in his consolidation.\r\n\r\nPossession of 100,000 shares would give control, and the public would\r\nimagine when the announcement of its purchase was made that this meant\r\nownership of most of the entire capital stock. Indeed, it afterward\r\ndeveloped that this was one of the conditions Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller relied on to deceive investors, for it was a natural\r\nassumption that nearly all of Anaconda and Parrott were included in the\r\nconsolidation, and in estimating the value of the properties the public\r\nwould multiply the market prices of their shares by the total capital\r\nstock and assume the result represented the assets of the amalgamation.\r\nFor instance, the valuation of 1,200,000 shares of Anaconda at $70, and\r\n200,000 shares of Parrott at $68--the prices at the time Amalgamated was\r\nfloated--would represent respectively $84,000,000 and $13,600,000;\r\nwhereas the company owned only 602,000 shares of Anaconda and a few\r\nshares over 100,000 of Parrott, selling for in all about $48,600,000.\r\n\r\nThe control of Parrott was in the hands of certain wealthy Connecticut\r\nbrass manufacturers, and, just previous to my receiving orders from Mr.\r\nRogers to acquire the property, they were so anxious to sell this mine\r\nthat they had given my brokers, Brown, Riley & Co., of Boston, an option\r\non a majority of their shares at $10 per share, agreeing to pay a large\r\ncommission should a good customer be secured. Before I could clinch at\r\nthis figure they took advantage of the excitement in \"Coppers\" to bid up\r\nthe stock, so that when I began operations Parrott was in the market at\r\n$15, and I offered $20 for the majority of the shares. An intimation of\r\nour purpose must have leaked, for other shrewd owners, also Connecticut\r\nmen, bid the price up still higher until I was forced to raise my limit\r\nto $30 per share--quite an advance on $10. On that figure we all agreed\r\nand the papers were prepared, but at the last moment a young man \"butted\r\nin\"--I think he was the son-in-law of one of the owners, who turned up\r\nwith an option, and declared he could get $40 per share for the\r\nproperty. We were trapped, for the alternative presented was to forego\r\nthe purchase or pay the price demanded. There was a conference, at which\r\nI denounced the \"hold-up\" in strenuous terms; but the son-in-law proved\r\nequal to the emergency and stood by his guns, though some of the old\r\ngentlemen declared his exaction was unwarrantable. In the discussion\r\nthere developed a queer fact--the son-in-law told us that the property\r\nwas a good deal richer than any one thought: he had discovered that a\r\ncertain section of rich ore in which there were several millions of\r\ndollars had been walled up by some designing person for his own purpose\r\nand the mine was easily worth $40 per share. I had heard stories of this\r\nkind before and frankly professed incredulity. The son-in-law agreed to\r\nreveal the ore to any one we might send to the mine, and so one of our\r\nmost trusted engineers was despatched with him to Butte on the\r\nagreement that if he were convinced that the walled-up values were all\r\nthat had been indicated, we should pay $40. If not, $30 would be the\r\nprice. The twain started at once; our expert was convinced, and we paid\r\nfour millions instead of one, two, or three. Strange to say, the\r\nsubsequent operations of the mine have never revealed the walled-up\r\nvalues; instead, there has been developed a queer lot of litigation, the\r\ntendency of which suggests strange uses of that extra million. Anyway,\r\nthe trade was made, and the gentleman of the Nutmeg State went home\r\nchuckling at the thought that though there was a \"Standard Oil,\" there\r\nwere others.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Oil\" never forgets. Sometimes it may get left at the post, but\r\nalways it catches up in the running--so as to be in the lead at the\r\ntape. When I reported the conclusion of this Parrott deal to Mr. Rogers,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, all's fair in a trade\"; but I shall never forget the expression\r\nhis face wore as he went on. \"Just give me the name, Lawson, again, of\r\nthat particular individual in this particular trade, that I may remember\r\nhim hereafter.\" He spoke in a low, intense tone, and each word was\r\nseparated from the preceding one by a dwelling stop. I gave him the name\r\nand the identification marks to go with it, and felt satisfied that even\r\nif the Nutmeg financier lived to be a thousand and Henry H. Rogers kept\r\nhim company, there would surely come an evening-up which would be the\r\nworse for the erstwhile victor. Sure enough it came soon afterward, for\r\nthe able Connecticut man, embarrassed at possessing so much uninvested\r\nmoney, came to us to ask advice about reinvesting it. The \"Standard Oil\"\r\nmagnate was most sympathetic and generous, and pointed out the obvious\r\nadvantages offered by the great new company Amalgamated, which would be\r\nout in a few days at $100 per share, and doubtless would sell soon\r\nafterward for $150 per share. The Nutmegite nibbled and then swallowed\r\nbait and hook whole, for when the subscription was announced his agents'\r\nnames were found opposite a large block. Later on he applied to us for\r\nconsolation and advice, for the stock he had bought at $100 and $124 was\r\nthen selling at $33. We figured out for him that after all he had little\r\nto complain of; \"for you see,\" we explained, \"fair exchange is no\r\nrobbery, and you have had just a fair exchange. You sold us your\r\nproperty inflated four times, and we sold it back to you under another\r\nname at about the same percentage.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the fireworks began, Anaconda sold in the market at $25 per\r\nshare, and Parrott, as I have shown, at $10, and in addition to the\r\nenormous profits which Mr. Rogers and Mr. Rockefeller made in the\r\nAmalgamated Company proper, they cleared some $15,000,000 to $20,000,000\r\non their outside purchases of Anaconda, and some $25,000,000 to\r\n$30,000,000 more later by selling it short (as I shall show hereafter),\r\nat the tremendously high prices which were obtained by leading the\r\npublic as well as myself to believe that they intended to purchase the\r\nentire stocks of both companies for the Amalgamated--that is, it was\r\ngiven out that the sections which were to come after were to have these\r\nminority holdings included in them. They sold Anaconda short in enormous\r\nquantities between $50 and $70, and Parrott between $50 and $68;\r\nafterward they bought them at $14 and $16 respectively, and no one knows\r\nhow many millions these gentlemen are taking in now, for both stocks are\r\nagain on the return trip, selling at the present writing at $32 and $30\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE DESPOILING OF LEONARD LEWISOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later there came another summons from New York. Realizing\r\nthat matters of importance were in the balance, I hurried over. Nothing\r\ncould surpass the cordiality of Mr. Rogers' greeting as I entered his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"we own Lewisohn Brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly lost no time,\" I replied. \"Is it actually fixed up\r\nalready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, settling back in his chair. \"It was about as I outlined\r\nto you the other day. We had a very pleasant sit-down--Leonard Lewisohn\r\nand I--and I frankly told him what I wanted, explained our plans, and\r\ngave him twenty-four hours to think things over. Next day he was in and\r\nwe went at it again. He began by talking $15,000,000, and it did come\r\nhard to bring it down to a little less than the actual cash and copper\r\non hand; but when he saw I intended to have things my way or not at all,\r\nhe meekly surrendered, and the United Metals Selling Company ($5,000,000\r\ncapital stock) is now a reality. And, Lawson, if I ever had to do with a\r\nbetter scheme I certainly cannot recall it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not Lewisohn put up any sort of a fight?\" I persisted, surprised\r\nthat so able and forceful a man should succumb so easily. \"Didn't you\r\nhave any words about the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any but pleasant ones,\" replied Mr. Rogers, \"although Lewisohn did,\r\nin an almost pathetic way, gasp when I emphasized that my only terms\r\nwere $5,000,000, fifty-one per cent. to us and forty-nine per cent. to\r\nhis people. He told me how he and his brothers had struggled up to\r\nsuccess. They began in a small way as feather merchants, you may\r\nremember, and from one thing to another they progressed until the firm\r\nis known to-day as one of the greatest copper houses and the greatest\r\ncoffee house in the world. He explained how he had brought up his three\r\nsons and his daughter's husband in the firm until they had become great\r\nmerchants, too; and his ambition was that their sons and grandchildren\r\nshould succeed to the institution, enlarging and strengthening it until\r\nthe house of Lewisohn was as famous as the house of Rothschild--with\r\nwhich, by the way, he is closely connected. I tell you, Lawson, I felt a\r\nbit mean when, after he had told me how he had always kept his name's\r\ncredit as good as any other man's bond, he asked me almost with tears in\r\nhis eyes to let the name of the new company be Lewisohn Brothers.\r\nIndeed, he made a strong argument on the great value of the name to the\r\ncopper business; but it did not take me long to show him the evils that\r\ngrow out of letting men's personalities get into the public's mind. I\r\nbattered down his objections by showing him the wisdom of Mr.\r\nRockefeller's attitude in this connection. Always, from the first, he\r\nhas taken the stand: 'The business first, the man second': with the\r\nresult that there has never been jealousy or dissension in Standard\r\nOil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Rogers went on; \"I wished I might have done this for him, for\r\nhe is a splendid fellow; but it would not do, for after the newness wore\r\noff he, or more probably his sons, would surely imagine that they, and\r\nnot we, were the real heads of the business.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have explained, Henry H. Rogers, when not working the handle or\r\nhopper end of the \"System's\" grinder, is a warm-hearted and generous\r\nman. And now, resting from his labors, he was the genial and kindly\r\ngentleman whom his social acquaintances admire so sincerely. I believe\r\nhe felt almost as badly as I did over the sad picture he had drawn of\r\nthe proud old merchant yielding up his children's birthright. I felt\r\ngrieved to the depths of my soul at Leonard Lewisohn's predicament, for\r\nI knew, as did all men connected with Wall Street or Copper, what a\r\nstalwart he was. He had the heart of an ox and the pluck of a lion, and\r\nhis white-man squareness and sense of justice belonged to other periods\r\nthan that of frenzied finance. No man or woman in distress ever left his\r\nhouse or office without relief, and he gave as generously of his time\r\nand advice as of his money. Amid the jagged rocks and treacherous cross\r\ncurrents of Wall Street Leonard Lewisohn stood as a beacon lighting the\r\nway to better things, and men pointed at him and said, \"There is still\r\nhope.\" Amalgamated may not have broken this man's heart as it did\r\nothers, but I can imagine the bitterness and distress it caused him,\r\nwhose proud boast it was that he had never gone back on his word. One of\r\nthe promoters of the company, his name stood, in the minds of many\r\ninvestors, especially European, for a guarantee of fair play and square\r\ndealing. Yet the course of Amalgamated was one continuous going back on\r\nwords. He had never allowed an associate of his to lose through his\r\nventures, but in Amalgamated there was nothing but loss, and loss by\r\ntrick and fraud. After the flotation, with its harvest of disgrace and\r\nscandal, Leonard Lewisohn became a changed man. His old-time happy smile\r\nwas seldom seen, and it is said that before he died he summoned his sons\r\nto him and instructed them to destroy the notes and obligations of all\r\nhis poor debtors and to return to them their collateral, of which there\r\nwas a safe full. This man employed no press agent, and so his golden\r\ndeeds were never reported in the papers, nor did he found a college to\r\nperpetuate his name; but he left a million of his estate to found a\r\ngreat home for the Jewish poor, for he loved and was proud of his race.\r\n\r\nI have given you a portrait of this man; let me, by way of contrast,\r\npresent another picture, which will help toward an appreciation of how\r\nthe votaries of the \"System\" respond to generosity and chivalrous\r\nself-abnegation. Before Leonard Lewisohn died he organized a tremendous\r\ndeal in coffee, and Rogers, Rockefeller, and all the other \"Standard\r\nOil\" men were in. A fund of $5,000,000 was subscribed, to which all\r\ncontributed in due proportion, and an immense amount of coffee was\r\nbought against a prospective scarcity. The condition Mr. Lewisohn\r\nanticipated did not immediately develop, and instead of rising, coffee\r\ndropped down and down until the $5,000,000 and more were all used up.\r\nAnother man would have called on his associates for additional margin,\r\nor, at least, closed up the deal. Not so Leonard Lewisohn. Though some\r\nof the other members of the combination were many times richer than he,\r\nhe shouldered the burden alone, saying: \"It's my scheme, and I'll carry\r\nit if it breaks me, or until my judgment is proven sound.\" Still coffee\r\ndeclined until he had sunk $12,000,000, but never a whimper and not a\r\nword of complaint to his partners. Things were near the worst when he\r\ndied, but he had instructed his heirs not to wind the deal up until\r\nevery cent of his associates' liability was wiped out.\r\n\r\nThere came a time not long ago when Leonard Lewisohn's foresight was\r\nvindicated, and an advance in the price of the commodity relieved the\r\n\"Standard Oil\" coterie of their responsibility. The sons of the old man\r\nthen desired to dispose of the great holdings of coffee, and so close\r\nthe deal and secure the locked-up millions for the estate. They went to\r\nthe various members of the syndicate and asked them to sign a release\r\nsimply agreeing to relieve the estate of liability for presumptive\r\nprofits growing out of further advances in coffee after they had sold\r\nout. It was a very ordinary legal precaution, and no great favor to the\r\nLewisohns under the circumstances. The members of the syndicate signed\r\nthe release in due course, until the document finally came to Henry H.\r\nRogers, and this is the contrasting picture:\r\n\r\n\"Coffee is going up, I think,\" said the \"Standard Oil\" magnate, \"and now\r\nthat the Lewisohns have extricated themselves from a bad hole, they may\r\nas well carry the stuff until I get some profit out of it. Neither Mr.\r\nRockefeller nor I will sign that document.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTENING OF AMALGAMATED\r\n\r\n\r\nMy readers may recall the wave of indignation which swept over this\r\ncountry when the news came of the kidnapping of Miss Stone, the American\r\nmissionary, by the bandits of Bulgaria, and how hot we all felt at the\r\ncapture of Ion Perdicaris by Raissuli, the Morocco rebel. Only in remote\r\nand barbarous countries, we reflected, could such outrages occur, and we\r\ndwelt with high inward satisfaction on our own splendid American\r\ninstitutions and law-abiding civilization. If only these miscreants were\r\non American soil so American justice could lay hands on them--what stern\r\npunishment would be meted out to them! Yet, under the panoply of these\r\nnoble institutions and just laws of ours, one citizen of our\r\ncommonwealth was enabled to seize from another millions of money and the\r\nownership of a great enterprise--literally wrench it from the hands of\r\nmen who had spent their lives in developing it--and the execution of the\r\ndeed involved neither financial nor physical risk and carried with it no\r\nlegal nor social consequences. Look on the picture, all ye free\r\nAmericans rejoicing in vaunted liberty and the right to the pursuit of\r\nhappiness--this able and successful merchant, head of a great business\r\nwhich it has been his life-work to rear, surrendering the splendid\r\nstructure at the mere nod of one man, whose \"I want it\" is more potent,\r\nmore irresistible, than family pride or Government decree. If Leonard\r\nLewisohn, a millionaire many times over, rich in connections with the\r\nstrongest financial houses of Europe, meekly submitted to the behest of\r\n\"Standard Oil,\" what resistance could the average man oppose to such a\r\npower? The logic of the situation is inevitable. Can you free Americans\r\nabsorb the details of this most extraordinary performance and not see\r\nthe coming storm as clearly as the mariner does when all along the\r\nhorizon creep the hosts of Boreas and the barometer drops like lead in a\r\nshot tower?\r\n\r\nAt last, in April, 1899, the first section of the much-heralded company\r\nwas ready to step before the footlights to the plaudits of an awaiting\r\nfinancial world, and it was really a great moment when Mr. Rogers sent\r\nme word: \"Come over, and be prepared to stay until the consolidation is\r\nformed and launched.\" I was at 26 Broadway next day, and we entered at\r\nonce on our council of war. It was a momentous sitting and secret, for,\r\nuntil the entire programme was mapped out and decided upon, no one was a\r\nparty to it or had knowledge of it but Mr. Rogers, his counsel, William\r\nRockefeller, and myself. After we had finished the final details, Mr.\r\nRogers said:\r\n\r\n\"This is a job on which we must not lose time, for if we give any one,\r\neven those who are to be directors, too long to think things over, there\r\nwill be counterplots, and a cog may slip or jump and we shall all be\r\ncrushed. We must all bear in mind that this thing has rolled up and up\r\nuntil it is unprecedented in business affairs, and if we slip up in any\r\nof the important details, we shall have a panic on our hands such as\r\nWall Street has never witnessed.\"\r\n\r\nOn all sides for weeks there had been accumulating evidence, which we\r\ncould see pointed to a monumental success or an avalanche failure. The\r\ncopper market was literally boiling, and investors from one end of\r\nAmerica to the other and throughout Europe were on the _qui vive_ for\r\nthe anticipated announcement. At intervals in history great \"booms\" are\r\nstarted, which bloom into iridescent bubbles, and for a moment dazzle\r\nthe world with fairy dreams of sudden millions. Greatest of all these\r\nwas the South Sea Bubble. Since then we have had the tulip craze in\r\nHolland, the Hooley excitement, and the Barney Barnato South African\r\nmining furor in England, the Secretan copper corner, and the tremendous\r\nbonanza delirium in California; but none of these, save the first, is\r\ncomparable with the magnitude of the copper maelstrom of 1899. The tulip\r\ncraze could have been thrust in and withdrawn again without diverting\r\none of its currents; the Barney Barnato affair was little more than an\r\neddy on the surface of English finance in contrast. We were dealing in\r\nhundreds and five hundreds of millions; shares rose and fell twenty to\r\nfifty points in a day; some had mounted to the giddy height of $900\r\neach; thousands of the public had invested their savings in one copper\r\nproperty or another, and all awaited with bated breath and marvelling\r\nanticipations the launching of this copper monster with its freight of\r\nhopes and visions.\r\n\r\nThe programme as specifically arranged had several important clauses.\r\nThe first involved the notification of James Stillman, President of the\r\nNational City, the \"Standard Oil\" Bank, who was to be let into only as\r\nmuch of the secret as was necessary to enable him to handle his\r\nimportant end intelligently. To Leonard Lewisohn it was decided to\r\nintrust the French, English, and German end of the subscription, and he\r\nwas at once to receive orders to lay his pipes. I may say here that this\r\ntask was admirably executed through his son-in-law, Philip Henry, of the\r\nEnglish branch of Lewisohn Brothers. The other directors of the company\r\nwere then and there selected, but it was agreed that they should not be\r\ntold of the distinction thrust upon them until the very eve of the\r\ncompany's formation.\r\n\r\nThis decision surprised me at the moment it was concluded, for with my\r\nBoston ideas I had regarded the gentlemen we had chosen to preside over\r\nthe destinies of our great company--all men of the highest prestige and\r\nstanding in American finance--as so powerful and so independent in their\r\nown fields as to be beyond either the coercion or the cajolery of\r\n\"Standard Oil.\" It was because of this reputation for integrity and the\r\nconfidence their names would inspire in the public mind that we had\r\nselected them; yet here was Mr. Rogers irreverently using them as the\r\nveriest pawns in his game, and taking absolutely for granted their\r\nimmediate consent to the loan of their reputations and honor for any\r\nscheme he might put up. The possibility of one of these eminent\r\nfinanciers objecting to be used in any way \"Standard Oil\" might desire\r\nwas a contingency evidently so remote as to be unworthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe legal aspects of the problem were considered, but as we felt sure of\r\nour ground it was agreed to avoid all delays in this direction. As a\r\nmatter of form and habit, however, Mr. Rogers said that at the last\r\nmoment, when the papers were ready to issue, he would have the wise\r\nlawyers in charge of the legal department of 26 Broadway run over them,\r\nbut whether they approved or not, he would allow no technicalities to\r\nhold up the flotation. This was certainly a departure from the\r\nwell-ordered rule of \"Standard Oil,\" but the urgency of the situation\r\nseemed to require it.\r\n\r\nAfter our council adjourned, not a moment was lost. The organization was\r\nquickly shaped up and got ready, and the time was ripe to broach to Mr.\r\nStillman the part that he and the funds deposited in the National City\r\nBank were to play in the forthcoming engagement. This was a crucial\r\npoint, and I saw that Mr. Rogers approached the task with no gusto.\r\nBefore he went off that night he spoke about the interview which was to\r\noccur after dinner, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind giving Fewer or Olcott or even Morgan but a minute's\r\nnotice, for every one of them will do about what I ask him to, but I\r\nshall feel better when I get through with Stillman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Stillman would never dare to refuse what you and Mr. William\r\nRockefeller asked, any more than he would the request of John D., would\r\nhe?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" Mr. Rogers replied. \"Stillman has been\r\ngrowing fast of late, and it is not nearly so easy to get him to consent\r\nto run deals blindly as it was formerly. Of course, if he were in on the\r\nbottom floor with us, it would be different. All I fear is, he may ask\r\nquestions, and if he does, it will not do for me to refuse an answer.\r\nAnd too many answers may be dangerous to our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not take him in with us--you, Mr. Rockefeller, and myself?\" I\r\nsuggested. \"The profits will stand it, and as far as my share goes I am\r\nwilling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by a jugful, Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers emphatically. \"Stillman will\r\nonly get what fairly belongs to him. He has had none of the risk or\r\nwork, and we do not need him in any way except through the bank, and the\r\nbank is 'Standard Oil's,' not his. He is lucky to get what I am going to\r\ngive him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in passing the authoritative manner in which\r\n26 Broadway speaks of the so-called institutions of the people that it\r\ncontrols--the banks, trust companies, and insurance companies, having\r\ndeposits of hundreds of millions of the public's money. Familiarly they\r\nare alluded to as \"_our_ bank\" or \"_our_ insurance company,\" as the case\r\nmay be. We are all apt to feel we own the things we use, and that Mr.\r\nRogers should speak of the millions of the National City Bank as \"our\r\nfunds\" is not surprising when he possesses the power and the privileges\r\nof doing with them as he pleases. I was too fascinated at that time by\r\nthe ready magic of \"Standard Oil\" to observe all the anomalous\r\nconditions my relation with it revealed. Such things all seemed a\r\nnatural attribute of the despotic and all-powerful institution that I\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nI was vastly relieved when Mr. Rogers reported, the following morning,\r\nthat at the dinner with Stillman everything had slipped through very\r\nsmoothly. Not only would the National City Bank take charge of the\r\nsubscription, but through the institution Mr. Stillman would furnish the\r\nmillions necessary to form the company. This meant supplying the\r\nparaphernalia in loans, checks, and cash necessary to pay in the\r\nseventy-five millions capital, thirty-nine millions of which must at\r\nonce be \"book-keepingly\" available to pay for the property bought from\r\nDaly, Haggin, and Tevis, and purchased by the company.\r\n\r\n\"It couldn't have gone through easier, Lawson,\" Mr. Rogers said quietly,\r\n\"for the fact is, Stillman seems to have got the copper fever as badly\r\nas any one else and is as anxious to take a hand as we are to have him.\r\nIt will be plain sailing now unless we strike some snag with Sterling or\r\nElliott\"--referring to the principal \"Standard Oil\" lawyers.\r\n\r\nBy this time such substantial progress had been made with the plans that\r\nthey were formulated on paper and the time had come when it seemed\r\nadvisable to try them on the \"Standard Oil\" law-department. We arranged\r\nthat night that next morning Mr. Rogers should himself go over the\r\nmatter with Mr. Sterling. I was waiting in his office when he returned\r\nfrom this consultation, and the expression of his face as he entered\r\nindicated plainly that a real snag had been struck. His jaw and the\r\ndroop of the upper corners of his eyelids gave a curiously sinister\r\naspect to his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"Sterling says if we carry out that plan there may be\r\nh--l to pay some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherein does he say it is wrong?\" I asked, not over-surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere. He says if there is any slip-up in the future Mr.\r\nRockefeller and myself may have to pay back a lot of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Just what we started to do.\" No lawyer's warnings could hold him back\r\nfrom the bursting barrels now in sight. He went on:\r\n\r\n\"I told Sterling to forget I had asked him to pass on the matter, and\r\nthat I would have my own counsel take the responsibility. So we go right\r\nahead, and nothing is to be said to any one, not even to William\r\nRockefeller. I have always argued that it is fool business to go to a\r\nlawyer with a scheme that depends entirely on how it is carried through\r\nas to whether it is perilous or not. I could have told Sterling there is\r\napt to be more danger in a deal in which one makes thirty-five to forty\r\nmillion dollars without turning a hair, than in furnishing staid advice\r\nfrom an office-chair for a fixed sum per diem.\"\r\n\r\nThe concentrated incisiveness of these sentences! Opposition, the mere\r\nsuggestion of danger, had stimulated his determination to proceed rather\r\nthan enjoined caution. Himself convinced of the expediency of our deal,\r\nno power on earth could make him deviate or face about. Truly a man of\r\nblood and iron, as Bismarck or Moltke was, his erected will is a sword\r\nand a vise. To gain a predetermined goal Henry H. Rogers will go through\r\nhell, fire, and water, swing about and make the return trip, and then\r\nrepeat, until death interferes or his object is attained. Such men as\r\nhe in other days subjugated kingdoms or made deserts where they\r\noperated; in religion they became St. Pauls or Savonarolas.\r\n\r\nIt may occur to my readers that in depicting Henry H. Rogers I use more\r\nwhitewash than tar, and that if he is half as determined and relentless\r\nas my characterization of him, he will surely exact a terrible reprisal\r\nfor what I have written here. In describing the man I adhere to the\r\nfacts, and before I began this crusade I weighed well the consequences.\r\nFrom the implacable wrath of Henry H. Rogers and his associates, from a\r\nthirst for vengeance which grows more bitter as it is deferred, nothing\r\ncan save me, nothing but--myself.\r\n\r\nAnd now events flew. Mr. Rogers took the forenoon to notify Governor\r\nFlower, President Frederic P. Olcott, of the Central Trust Company;\r\nMarcus Daly, and J. P. Morgan, that they, in connection with William\r\nRockefeller, himself, his counsel, and James Stillman, were to\r\nconstitute the directors of the new company.\r\n\r\n\"There, Lawson,\" he said, when he returned to 26 Broadway, \"that job is\r\ndone, and I am glad it's off my hands. It was all pleasant enough but\r\nthe Morgan part. I wish it were possible for us to get along without\r\nhaving his assistance, but it isn't. Leaving him out would create\r\ncomment, from which it would be only a short step to Wall Street's\r\nnosing around and manufacturing something uncomfortable, even if they\r\ndidn't discover it. I don't like Morgan a bit, and he likes us less. It\r\nwon't be long before one or the other of us will be able to do business\r\nwithout knowing what the other's about, much less consulting him--not\r\nvery long.\"\r\n\r\nAs the \"not very long\" shot out from between his lips much as the\r\ntail-end of an up-chimney wind switches itself around the angle of the\r\nfireplace, I felt there was little doubt in his mind who would be left\r\nto do business after the final drag-out and clean-up. At the same time\r\nit did not dissipate a sort of come-and-go confidence I had that the old\r\nterrapin around whom so many of Wall Street's eddies have swirled would\r\ncause the 26-Broadway crowd many a broken knife-blade before crawling or\r\nbeing pushed into his shell. Turtles are not much good as sprinters,\r\nbut they're blue-ribbon winners when it comes to the staying class.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't meet with any set-back with Morgan, did you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Mr. Rogers replied; \"he simply said it would be best,\r\neverything considered, for us to put in his right-hand man, Robert\r\nBacon, instead of himself, and I agreed with him; in fact, I think it\r\nmuch better, as Bacon is a rattling good fellow who takes no interest in\r\nthe other fellow's business, even when he does happen to be a director\r\nin the other fellow's company, and he will recognize that this copper\r\naffair is mine, not Morgan's.\" He stopped abruptly. \"Now, Lawson, let us\r\nsettle upon what in this case is an important point, the name of the\r\ncompany.\" He had asked me the day before to think of a suitable title\r\nfor our organization, and I had put in some time with a pad and pencil\r\nexperimenting. I had several names ready for him, but after I had run\r\nover them and given my reasons, he said:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more important than to have just the right name for a\r\ncompany which is going to make history, is there?\"\r\n\r\nI agreed; in fact, even more than he I was impressed with the\r\ndesirability of a suitable name for a corporation whose stock was bound\r\nto become a great market star, and I was not satisfied with any I had\r\ndug up. Give a stock or a book a good name, and it is sure to be\r\nnumbered among the best sellers.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers continued:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, we want something as good as 'Standard Oil,' if it is possible\r\nto find it. Now\"--and he drew over one of his little writing-pads and\r\ntaking a slim gold pencil from his pocket slowly wrote something and\r\nhanded it to me--\"how do you like this?\"\r\n\r\nI read \"'Amalgamated Copper Company.' Perfect!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would say so\"; and he reached over and wrote underneath\r\nthe name, \"A second Standard Oil.\" It was an impressive moment for both\r\nof us. I folded the slip, and putting it in my pocket said: \"You will\r\nsee this again, Mr. Rogers, when its stock sells for as much as\r\nStandard Oil.\"\r\n\r\nSurely an adder crawled from that tiny golden cylinder and upon the\r\nsmooth white paper distilled its subtle venom. I, poor fool, exulting in\r\nthe splendid throes of accomplishment, never dreamed that the real\r\nchristening of my bantling was the toast the Master of Hell drank as the\r\nname \"Amalgamated\" was slowly traced upon the pad before my eyes; never\r\ndreamed that this cherished offspring on whose rearing I had lavished\r\nall I possessed of dollars, of ideals, of generous hopes and high\r\nexpectations--whose growth I had literally watered with my sweat--was an\r\nimp of darkness. My fool's paradise I had planted with all manner of\r\nfair flowers and lordly trees, and in my folly believed that those who\r\nhad been my friends were forever after assured of pleasant places,\r\nlovely perfumes, and grateful shade; but like the Grecian in the ancient\r\nfable, I found I had sown dragon's teeth, and the crop I reaped was of\r\nhatred and envy, passion and revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nFIXING THE RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day before Amalgamated's incorporation, Mr. Rogers and I\r\nconferred long and earnestly upon the plan of campaign for the company's\r\norganization. It was very necessary to avoid all errors, and to have\r\neverything cut and dried in advance. We were obliged to railroad things\r\nthrough, once started, a hitch or a side-track might be fatal, and I\r\ndesired to have Mr. Rogers pass upon the programme I had drawn up.\r\nTherein was set down the work of each captain, lieutenant, and\r\nwater-carrier who was to take part, and we discussed every detail to a\r\nfinish. When he had approved everything up to the point where formation\r\nended and the flotation began, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Now comes the most important part of all--the offer to the public; for\r\na slip-up, the misuse of a single phrase, or even of a word, at this\r\npoint might destroy our whole structure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true, Lawson,\" he answered, \"but I have no fear of you there. Let\r\nme have your idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" I replied, \"there should be an advertisement of the National\r\nCity Bank, and one of the Amalgamated Company, and in this advertisement\r\nthe story of the good things we have collected must be told in strong\r\nterms.\"\r\n\r\nI am now about to explain exactly of what the First Crime of Amalgamated\r\nconsisted, and it behooves my readers to weigh carefully the details,\r\nfor I make the claim here that without further proof they will be able\r\nto realize not only my own position and purpose at this, the crucial,\r\nstage of the Amalgamated enterprise, but to grasp the cold-blooded\r\nvillany of the men I am exposing.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was in a most uncomfortable and uncertain position. Each\r\nday that I did business with Mr. Rogers and his associates increased my\r\nknowledge of their heartless brutality in dollar-making. I knew I was on\r\ndangerous ground; but to retreat meant not only my own destruction but\r\nterrible losses to my friends who had followed me and to the public\r\nwhich had come in on my advice. So I had made up my mind to go on but to\r\nkeep my eyelids pinned back, my tongue anchored, and what gray matter I\r\npossessed oscillating. Remember, I was in no way sure that Mr. Rogers\r\nintended to misuse the public, but I suspected that his coat-sleeves\r\ncontained more things than his shirt-cuffs, and that he was playing a\r\ngame other than the one he let me see. Up to now Mr. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller had kept me between the people and their legal\r\nresponsibility by having all public statements made over my signature. I\r\nhad half-way concluded that this was done to avoid future accounting,\r\nbut there might be other reasons. I determined when it came to the\r\nflotation, which would be the first time they took openly the public's\r\nmoney, to connect them publicly with my statements. It is next to\r\nimpossible for any man to sit in front of Henry H. Rogers and give one\r\nreason for his actions and have another about his person; but this was a\r\ndesperate situation and I resolved at any cost to carry my point. How\r\ndifficult a task I had undertaken I did not realize until I was well\r\ninto it. When I had stated the form I thought Amalgamated's first\r\nannouncement should have, Mr. Rogers paused. He repeated:\r\n\r\n\"The City Bank--that's a question. Now, how do you propose to go about\r\nthat advertisement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply this way,\" I replied. \"I will draw up a memorandum of the main\r\nstrong points about the Amalgamated Company, and you will ask Mr.\r\nStillman to have some of his people write them into a good, clear\r\nstatement. This we will publish as an advertisement over the bank's\r\nsignature, and have the Amalgamated Company indorse it, showing that it\r\nis joined with the bank in responsibility for the truth of the\r\nannouncement.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers said nothing, but continued to gaze inquiringly at me. I went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\"Or, the Amalgamated Company can be the principal and the bank the\r\nindorser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what is the bank to say in this statement?\" he asked very\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\"The big things about our enterprise that I have been telling the\r\npublic. We will put them forward in an old-fashioned, unequivocal\r\nway--that should accomplish what we want,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nHe was looking at me in a curiously searching manner as I spoke. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Let us have the strongest one or two as an illustration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for instance, what I have advertised so often, that this stock is\r\nso good the 'Standard Oil' people who formerly owned the property behind\r\nit would prefer to own all the stock and hold it as a permanent\r\ninvestment, but that the enterprise is so large their interests will be\r\nbetter served by letting the public in than going it alone. You and I\r\nknow that's true. Also that the company is earning sixteen per cent. and\r\nwill always pay eight per cent. or over. Something to that effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose, Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers, straightening up and speaking\r\nvery impatiently, \"that the public will swallow any statement of that\r\nkind? Just think it over--William Rockefeller, James Stillman, and\r\nmyself, to say nothing of others, openly spending our money for\r\nadvertisements to induce Tom, Dick, and Harry to buy stock at par which\r\nwe know is earning sixteen per cent. and will always pay eight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I responded. \"I have practically stated the same thing scores\r\nof times as your agent, until, so far as the public is concerned, my\r\ntelling it is the same as though 'Standard Oil' had said it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well and good,\" Mr. Rogers went on dryly. \"But, Lawson, you know\r\nthere's a heap of real difference between your telling it and our\r\nputting it over our signature.\"\r\n\r\nI well knew the difference, but I had my point to make; so I said:\r\n\r\n\"All right. Let the City Bank and Mr. Stillman put it their own way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, that's foolish,\" Mr. Rogers returned. \"They must not be allowed\r\nto have anything to do with it save to O. K. what we are to advertise\r\nover their signature. Stillman would never agree to our using the City\r\nBank to hawk any stock but a gilt-edged one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't this a gilt-edged one?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers glared at me.\r\n\r\n\"Why waste time and words over a matter that you know as well as I must\r\nbe handled very, very gingerly? It is not because it is not gilt-edged,\r\nbut because of the peculiar situation of it. The public thinks this\r\nstock which is to be offered to it belongs to the Amalgamated Company,\r\nand that the City Bank is selling it for the Amalgamated treasury just\r\nas in any of the ordinary first-class issues they offer for\r\nsubscription; whereas we know that the stock belongs to us and the bank\r\nis selling it for our profit. If the public suspected that this stock\r\nwas ours, and that we were not going to subscribe on the same basis as\r\nthemselves, it would demand to know what we paid for it, and if we\r\ndidn't tell, it would be figured out as a clear case of false\r\nrepresentation. Where would that leave us? Mr. Rockefeller, myself, the\r\nbank, and Stillman would be held for every cent of the capital forever.\r\nWe cannot put our heads into any such halter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see why not,\" I expostulated. \"You and I know there is no more\r\nchance of loss than if we were dealing in the City Bank's own stock,\r\nbecause of the way we are handling the deal, selling only $5,000,000 to\r\nthe public, and standing behind every dollar of that, all possible risk\r\nis eliminated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call all that true,\" angrily replied Mr. Rogers, \"and you don't alter\r\nthe fact that such a scheme as you map out _is impossible_. You must get\r\nto work and figure out some plan which is practical.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that we should find this a difficult matter to get right,\" I\r\nsaid. \"Now, what is your idea of how it should be gone about?\"\r\n\r\nThis time the burden of explanation was fairly upon Mr. Rogers, and I\r\nwaited his answer expectantly. He replied, in much milder tones:\r\n\r\n\"There is no real difference between us, Lawson, except that you don't\r\nseem to realize the actual position we are in. We are going to do what\r\nis fair and right in this enterprise--indeed, there is no necessity for\r\nanything else--but we must not put the bank or ourselves in such a place\r\nthat either or both of us can be held legally responsible for anything\r\nthat happens in connection with this company. You must keep in mind\r\nSterling's words, that the thing is risky enough anyway, and that even\r\nunder the best circumstances and conditions we may find ourselves in a\r\nhole. Exactly how to do it I have not figured out, but the City Bank\r\nmust appear as offering the subscriptions, and the Amalgamated Company\r\nas owning the stock, and simultaneously some one else must tell all\r\nabout the advantages. Unless this latter is very fully done, the public\r\nwill not only refuse to subscribe, but will get suspicious, and there\r\nmight be a big scandal. It seems to me as though this part of the job is\r\nyours to do, and to do just right.\"\r\n\r\nSo far in our argument we were even. We eyed each other as fighters do\r\nin a ring--looking for an opening. Both sparred for an idea. Mr. Rogers'\r\nreluctance to shoulder any legal responsibility deepened my suspicions,\r\nand inwardly I sweated blood at the thought of the deviltry that might\r\nbe piled up around the affair. However, there was nothing for it but to\r\nsquare away and keep sparring, for if I lost my temper and exploded, it\r\nmeant that I should be ground up or disappear in the hopper, and then,\r\ngood-by to independence. It was the first time I had ever sat in a\r\nfinish game with the master of \"Standard Oil,\" and I trembled at the\r\npossible outcome. Yet this duel--for it was as clearly a fight for life\r\non my side as though we both were armed with deadly weapons--was but one\r\nof a thousand similar encounters the Rogerses and Rockefellers had had\r\nwith other adversaries as fearless and as honest as I, and out of these\r\nheart-breaking and soul-crushing sit-downs they had always emerged\r\nsurvivors, while behind the \"Standard Oil\" juggernaut, defeated and\r\nsubmissive, trudged the men who had dared oppose them. Should the fate\r\nof these others be also mine? Across my mind flitted \"not while my brain\r\nretains its fly-wheels and my hands their power\"; and I found myself\r\nwondering if there were not some stage at which a man cornered by\r\narbitrary conditions and legal observances was justified in bursting all\r\nsuch trammels and meeting artifice with physical violence. Murder is a\r\ncrime against society and against nature, and we must all observe the\r\ncanons of God and the regulations of the law; but at least a dozen times\r\nin my wrestles with the exasperating, grinding, hell-generating machine,\r\nit was only my inborn reverence for God's law and man's that prevented\r\nme from--well, shall I say, strangling the fox?\r\n\r\nAll this, however, was between me and my mind. I showed not a vestige of\r\nit on the surface, but went on with much earnestness:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, I think I understand the situation perfectly, but let us\r\nsee if I do. We have reached a point where we are out in the open, and\r\nthe whole world is in position to pass judgment on us and our venture.\r\nThere must be between us unanimity of purpose, for the time is past when\r\nI can say one thing, you another, and Stillman and his bank confuse all\r\nconcerned by agreeing with one story and denying the second. It is\r\nessential that we all pull together, yet conditions are such--and no\r\none's to blame for them, for they have so developed--that we cannot have\r\na general pow-wow to organize a programme. We, you and I, must formulate\r\na plan which can be sent out to the public with the approval of all\r\nconcerned, all the parties to it being sure they understand absolutely\r\nits meaning, while in reality it means something different to each of\r\nthem. Isn't that about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have covered the situation fully, Lawson,\" approved Mr. Rogers.\r\n\"You must understand that this tie-up is due to our having departed from\r\nour usual way of doing business. 'Standard Oil' never goes to the public\r\ndirect for money, but works up its projects through some of our\"--he\r\nalmost said \"dummies,\" but caught himself--\"our lieutenants. You have\r\nworked up this affair in our name instead of your own, as would have\r\nbeen the safer way.\"\r\n\r\nI thought to myself, \"You cannot, whatever you do, evade responsibility\r\nfor the millions you are to take this time\"; but I went on smoothly:\r\n\r\n\"This, then, is how I see our procedure: We will write out an\r\nadvertisement for the City Bank. You will have Mr. Stillman pass it for\r\nthe bank, by authorizing me to publish it. You will then authorize me to\r\npublish a second advertisement on behalf of the Amalgamated Company. If\r\nthere is any slip-up, I, as the agent of both, will have to become\r\nresponsible instead of you. Is that right?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. I went on:\r\n\r\n\"Besides these, there must be a third advertisement, in which some one\r\nwill tell the strong facts about Amalgamated, and it will be so worded\r\nas to bring the public with its money into the City Bank just the same\r\nas though it were signed by the bank, Stillman, the Amalgamated Company,\r\nand you and Mr. Rockefeller. What's the use of beating round the bush\r\nany longer? The one to sign that story and stand behind it is myself,\r\nbecause, owing to conditions, no one else will.\"\r\n\r\nI had said it. Mr. Rogers' eyes snapped just once. Only on two other\r\noccasions in all my long and intimate acquaintance with this wonderful\r\nman have I seen him lose his self-control. To anger he will give way\r\nfrankly if the occasion justifies it or he desires to intimidate or\r\nimpress an individual; but his face, mobile though it is, presents a\r\ncalm and impassive mask. I caught the snap, and I think he caught me\r\ncatching it. It meant much to me--more even than if he had said in so\r\nmany words \"I've got him.\" In such encounters one cannot see into one's\r\nadversary's mind nor know what he is trying to do, and any indication is\r\nlike the sight of a buoy in a fog to a mariner. I gathered that the snap\r\nindicated relief at my compliance, and that he had been afraid I might\r\nbalk. That showed me that consent on my part was important--which meant\r\nthat he saw no possible way of carrying the enterprise to the end we had\r\nmapped out unless I stepped into the gap. Then I knew that he would have\r\nto agree to my terms, provided they were not too harsh and that I did\r\nnot too vehemently insist upon them. It is a cardinal principle of\r\n\"Standard Oil\" never to do anything they decide they won't do, and that\r\nwhich they decide they won't do is what any man on earth says they must\r\ndo. You may lead \"Standard Oil,\" but you cannot drive it. If at that\r\ncritical moment I had foreseen all that subsequently occurred, or\r\nrealized that this copper affair, which was to me a matter of life and\r\ndeath, was to Henry H. Rogers only another device to extort dollars from\r\nthe public, I should then and there have thrown down the gauntlet and\r\ndemanded that \"Standard Oil\" step out into the open and assume all legal\r\nresponsibility, or have exposed the whole scheme. But my suspicions were\r\nsuspicions only, and I could not be sure that Mr. Rogers was doing other\r\nthan discretion warranted, when he desired to have things done in such a\r\nway as to allow me to continue to conjure with the magic name \"Standard\r\nOil.\" In other words, wasn't he doing exactly what I myself was engaged\r\nupon? I was planning to have him consent to things he was otherwise\r\nunwilling to allow, and he, in his turn, was scheming to have the bank\r\nand his \"Standard Oil\" associates pass over things they would be sure to\r\nquestion if presented less adroitly, or if they came from some other\r\nquarter. Yet all I was trying to accomplish was honest and best for all.\r\nWhy might not his intentions be as fair as mine? However, the eye-snap\r\ndetermined me to steer nearer the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Well and good, Mr. Rogers,\" I went on. \"I will tell the story I know is\r\ntrue and that you know is true, and that you have repeatedly given me\r\nyour word you would stand by me in telling, but I will only do so in a\r\nway I deem safe and fair to myself. Is that agreed?\"\r\n\r\nHe winced a bit. \"What do you mean by that?\" he said. \"What do you mean\r\nby a 'way safe and fair' to yourself? You are not suspicious of any of\r\nus, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suspicious is not the word, Mr. Rogers. I brought you and Mr.\r\nRockefeller this copper enterprise. We have gone ahead with it upon\r\nclearly laid down lines. I have done to the letter all I agreed, and, so\r\nfar, the enterprise has more than fulfilled my promises. I realize that\r\nour success has largely come from our going to the public and openly\r\ntelling it what we were doing and what we intended to do. Until now, I\r\nam the one who has made all the promises, and, legally, up to this\r\npoint, I am the only one who can be called to account, but it is the\r\nfact that for any statement I have made, you and Mr. Rockefeller have\r\nbeen as much responsible as myself, and you as much or more than I have\r\nhad the benefit which has come from what I have promised. Now we are\r\nready for business with the public, and there must be a clear and\r\ndistinct understanding with it or it will not part with its money. This\r\nunderstanding can have but one bearing--_that what the public read, we\r\nmust all be responsible for legally and morally, not some of us, but all\r\nof us, you, Mr. Rockefeller, the City Bank, James Stillman, and myself_.\r\nFor bear in mind it was you and Mr. Rockefeller who changed my plans by\r\nsubstituting companies and properties of which I knew nothing but what\r\nyou told me. All the things we ought to tell, you say cannot be put into\r\nwords, because if they are powers beyond us will refuse to allow the\r\nenterprise to go through as it must go through. Then the condition must\r\nbe implied, must be between the lines. You say this is my task, and that\r\nI alone can perform it properly. All right--but I will perform it in a\r\nway that will hold every one concerned to his legal as well as to his\r\nmoral responsibility just as it will me who sign it. To save our\r\nenterprise I will concede just this much: The advertisements will be so\r\nworded as not apparently legally to involve Stillman, William\r\nRockefeller, or the Bank but in reality they will be bound to as strict\r\nresponsibility as though their signatures were in the place of mine. In\r\ndoing this I compromise with my conscience, Mr. Rogers, because it is\r\nnow of paramount importance that our consolidation go through--as\r\nimportant to the thousands of others who have followed us as to\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean this, Lawson, that you will insist upon having this done in a\r\nway that will make every one legally responsible?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean just that, Mr. Rogers. In what other way can it be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"As all such affairs are arranged--by allowing the public to think for\r\nthemselves--but steering our end clear of all possible legal\r\nentanglements,\" he replied in a voice half choked with suppressed rage.\r\nNow we were both thoroughly aroused, he fairly seething with fury at my\r\nrebellion, and I boiling over at his willingness to sacrifice me to his\r\nown safety. By this time he was on his feet facing me, and it was\r\nevident the tussle would be serious. Still I slowly and coldly asked:\r\n\r\n\"How can that be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"By _your_ taking the responsibility,\" he as slowly and freezingly\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"You mean that _I_ shall go ahead and make glowing and generous\r\npromises, on the strength of which the public will put up its money, and\r\nthat if these promises for any reason are not carried out, I alone shall\r\nbe the one to face the music? Is that what you mean, Mr. Rogers?\"\r\n\r\nI held myself together, with closed hands and clinched teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Just that,\" he returned. \"You are making millions out of this\r\nenterprise, and I consider this is one of the places where you earn\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if every one of the millions you mention were multiplied a thousand\r\ntimes, Mr. Rogers, do I say one word to the public to induce it to part\r\nwith its money--not a word that will not hold you and Mr. Rockefeller,\r\nStillman, and the City Bank to a full responsibility--not if, on the\r\nother hand, I become a pauper.\"\r\n\r\nIt was out. I know that the deadly earnestness I felt was in my voice,\r\nfor though I spoke in a low tone I thought my head would burst until the\r\nlast word was spoken. We looked at each other--glared is not the word to\r\ndefine that white-hot yet frozen, \"another-step-and-I-shoot\" look which\r\nof all expressions of which the human face is capable is most intense\r\nand dangerous. I did not flinch. I did not know what he would do, but I\r\nsaw my words impressing on his mind the absolute conviction that for\r\nonce he was face to face with a resolution no power of his could alter.\r\nSlowly his anger, his will, seemed to subside, but as they did I was\r\naware intuitively that he had changed tactics and was coming at me from\r\nanother direction. In an instant his whole being seemed to relax and he\r\ndropped into a chair with a sigh of relief as he said:\r\n\r\n\"All right, Lawson. You've thought it out, I see. You are making a bad\r\nmistake, but as your mind is made up, I can do the only thing left to\r\ndo--call the whole business off for the time being.\"\r\n\r\nI had not served as Mr. Rogers' pike-carrier in vain. Superb actor\r\nthough he is, I saw his bluff, and quick as a hair-trigger called it.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your decision, Mr. Rogers?\" I asked, almost before the last\r\nword was out of his mouth. I did not attempt to shade the\r\n\"If-it-is-I'm-off\" tone of my voice.\r\n\r\nHe replied slowly and naturally, as though he were taking his decision\r\nright off the scales:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will call it off for good. I've hung so long by the heels on\r\nthis whole matter that anything is better than a further wait. I'm for\r\nBoston on the next train, and by to-morrow I'll have figured out where\r\nwe stand.\"\r\n\r\nI started for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute.\" His voice was as indifferent as though no tremendous\r\nissue were at stake, for Henry H. Rogers is of the iron-willed breed\r\nwhom peril never betrays into trepidation. He would throw dice for his\r\nlife as casually as one of your Wall Street tipsters would for a cigar,\r\nand here reputation and millions were in the balance. I knew as well as\r\nthough I had seen the message telegraphed across his mind that he had\r\nsaid to himself, \"It didn't work, I must round to,\" but I knew my man\r\nwell enough to realize that a false move now would tip victory back into\r\ndefeat. I halted. As naturally as though there had been no calculation\r\nin the tone of resigned despair which tinged my voice, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers, don't let us prolong this talk. You well know what this\r\ndecision of yours means to me, so let me go where I can think it to a\r\nfinish.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant Henry H. Rogers was again his virile and commanding self.\r\nHe jumped to his feet. His words came round and tense, passionately\r\nconvincing and persuasive.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, are you crazy? Would you go back to Boston and smash this\r\nbusiness that we have spent years on? Would you sacrifice the millions\r\nthat are in your grasp? Would you? Would you, I say? You know I would\r\nnot threaten you, but I ask, would you do this, and at a time when you\r\nare all tied and tangled up with us in such a way that you would be\r\nbankrupt, literally be a pauper, and all because I insist upon things\r\nthat conditions over which I have no control compel me to demand?\"\r\n\r\nWhether he intended to halt or not I never knew, for I let him have my\r\npent-up feelings in eleven words that gave me as much relief as any\r\nthousand I could have selected had I a day to do it in:\r\n\r\n\"As true as there is a God above us, I would!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY FASTENED\r\n\r\n\r\nLife's alternatives are seldom labelled. Right is not always white, nor\r\nwrong, black. The parting of the ways is oftentimes to the eye no more\r\nthan the forking of main-travelled roads, and good intentions are no\r\nsure guide to the straight path. This, however, was one of those rare\r\ncrossings at which Fate's red light swung full in view, and in its\r\nwarning glow I seemed to read the sign:\r\n\r\n\"Settle Right or Forever Regret.\"\r\n\r\nWell it was for me and for those thousands who were victimized and\r\nrobbed later that I heeded the monition, for if in the interests of\r\npeace I had allowed myself to be overwhelmed by the imperious will of\r\nHenry H. Rogers, I should to-day be as helpless as those others who,\r\ncoming forward to accuse, are met with \"Standard Oil's\" crushing\r\nrejoinder, \"It's a lie--you can't prove it.\" I have wondered since if\r\nthe master of \"Standard Oil\" also saw the red signal or interpreted its\r\nprophetic message. His eyes still met mine in the same deadly, intense\r\nstare, but the anger had passed out. Then in an instant the battle was\r\nmine. Henry H. Rogers came out of the clouds and with a gesture of his\r\nhand waved away all that had passed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"D--n it, Lawson, you are a most impractical man to do business with,\r\nbut I suppose you must have your way. Now just tell me--and put it in\r\nfew and plain words--what is it you intend to do to get this affair\r\nthrough, for we must carry it to a finish at once, although it does seem\r\nhard that I must do things I don't want to and which may put me in a bad\r\nhole; but let us hope the future will only show that all these\r\nprecautions were a waste of energies. Bear in mind, though, that\r\nwhatever is done, must be so arranged that no one but me will know the\r\nreal condition, for though I have given way, William Rockefeller and\r\nStillman, to say nothing of the others, would throw up the whole affair\r\nrather than incur the danger of future litigation and trouble.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mr. Rogers had, I believe, made up his mind to play so\r\nfair with the public that there should never arise dissatisfaction with\r\nthe course of Amalgamated, that is, he had determined to be content with\r\na half brick of gold without retribution or restitution in place of the\r\nwhole fraught with penalties of exposure and reprobation. At that period\r\nhis cupidity had not flared into the towers of fire it afterward became,\r\nin the smoke and flame of which all undefined dangers were obscured.\r\n\r\n\"As you will, Mr. Rogers,\" I assented; \"that part is not my hunt. I\r\nshould prefer that our associates knew things as _we_ do, but as it\r\nseems that is impossible, I must be satisfied with knowing that you\r\nthoroughly understand the conditions I am going ahead on. Here they are:\r\nFirst, all public notices must bear the names not only of the\r\nAmalgamated Company and the City Bank, but of the individuals,\r\nRockefeller, Rogers, and Stillman. As the real story is to be told by me\r\nalone, these names will prevent any suspicion the public, particularly\r\nWall Street, would have that there was any lukewarmness or dodging. This\r\nmeans that you and Mr. Rockefeller must be known as officers of the\r\ncompany as well as directors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Lawson, right there, that is impossible--absolutely out of the\r\nquestion. William Rockefeller will under no circumstances take on\r\nadditional duties of this kind, and whatever the consequences, I cannot\r\npersuade him to.\"\r\n\r\nI saw he meant this, and that we must get around it.\r\n\r\n\"Let us begin at the beginning, then--the president. You should be\r\npresident--over the flotation, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible, too, for you know it is settled that Marcus Daly is\r\npresident. I promised the position to him as a part of the trade. It\r\nwould be ridiculous for me, who it is known am not a copper expert, to\r\nbe president of a new copper company in which Marcus Daly is a large\r\nowner and is supposed to have a prominent hand. Besides, in certain\r\nparts of the country his name will stand much better than mine, and it\r\nmeans much to all miners the world over.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right for president,\" I answered. \"That settles, then, where you\r\nwould naturally come in--vice-president; and as vice-president it will\r\nbe proper to print your name in the advertisement below that of the\r\npresident.\"\r\n\r\nHe demurred at first, but finally acquiesced, for he had now made up his\r\nmind to play out the string. For treasurer and secretary he suggested a\r\nbrother of Governor Flower's, but I knew that this was now the only\r\nplace left where the magic name of Rockefeller could be used and I drew\r\nhis attention to the fact.\r\n\r\n\"How can we do it, Lawson, when I have told you it is impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"William Rockefeller has a son, William G. Rockefeller. He's our man for\r\ntreasurer and secretary. Not one in ten thousand but will think William\r\nG. is the senior Rockefeller, so the name is as good for the country as\r\nhis father's, and in State and Wall streets it is better, for among\r\nfinanciers it is known that William Rockefeller would hesitate longer\r\nabout putting his son out in the open in an enterprise he did not\r\napprove than about getting in himself. So William G. Rockefeller it must\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers did not take kindly to the idea, and I could see it would be\r\nquite a task for him to arrange the matter. However, it was necessary,\r\nand he undertook the contract. I went on:\r\n\r\n\"That covers the company. Second, we will print three advertisements--a\r\nplain notice of the City Bank, which must be signed not only with the\r\nusual 'National City Bank,' but 'James Stillman, President.' This will\r\nimmediately follow the company's advertisement, which I shall so word\r\nthat the enormous properties composing the consolidation will be set\r\nforth, yet without details of the extent of our holdings in any of them.\r\nIn its own advertisement offering the stock the City Bank will refer to\r\nthe advertisement of the Amalgamated as though all particulars had there\r\nbeen given, and I will see that it reads openly and frankly and yet\r\ncontains nothing that need scare Stillman. Then there will be a third\r\nadvertisement, signed by myself, in which, in the plainest and strongest\r\nterms at my command, I shall tell just what the company is and what it\r\nproposes to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far all right,\" assented Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\n\"There is one more thing,\" I went on. \"It cannot openly be put forward\r\nthat I am the authorized agent of the Amalgamated Company and the City\r\nBank--well, I must have the equivalent of this. It must be shown by\r\ninference. If I insert these three advertisements in the papers and pay\r\nfor them, and the company pays me for them, it will be proof positive\r\nfor all time that I acted as the authorized agent of not only the\r\ncompany and the City Bank, but of Marcus Daly, yourself, William\r\nRockefeller's son, and James Stillman, and therefore that whatever my\r\nadvertisement says is binding upon them. Remember, though, it will be\r\nyour affair whether you tell them of it or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You persist, Lawson, that this is necessary?\" Mr. Rogers interrogated.\r\n\"You seem to lose sight of the position I shall be in should anything\r\nhappen later to reveal to these men with whom I am so closely associated\r\nin business that they were binding themselves without their knowledge,\r\nand that I was fully aware of the fact.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAWSON'S ADVERTISEMENT WHICH APPEARED IN CONJUNCTION WITH\r\nAMALGAMATED'S.\r\n\r\n     =COPPERS.=\r\n\r\n     =Amalgamated Subscription.=\r\n\r\n     Owing to the very large number of inquiries (over 3,000 the\r\n     first day), received and anticipated, as to the best means\r\n     of securing an allotment of the first issue of the\r\n     consolidated stock, it is necessary to reply collectively by\r\n     this advertisement. I advise the purchase of Amalgamated by\r\n     subscription, because it is, in my opinion, the best\r\n     opportunity ever offered the public for safe and profitable\r\n     investment. It is probably the first time in the history of\r\n     public subscriptions that a stock is worth and can be sold\r\n     for 50 to 75 per cent. more than the subscription price, and\r\n     yet will be allotted to each and every subscriber in\r\n     proportion to his application. This means that every one who\r\n     makes a bona-fide subscription, large or small, will receive\r\n     shares at one hundred dollars each that can be sold at once\r\n     at a large profit.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion the entire $75,000,000 is worth and can be\r\n     sold to-day for from 30 to 60 per cent. more than the\r\n     subscription price.\r\n\r\n     First--Because the assets now owned by the Amalgamated\r\n     Company are worth from $100,000,000 to $125,000,000.\r\n\r\n     Second--Because the Amalgamated Company is now earning at\r\n     the rate of 12 to 16 per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\n     Third--Because it will, from the start and always after, pay\r\n     8 per cent. dividends annually.\r\n\r\n     Fourth--Because the interests actively engaged in its\r\n     management will make and keep it one of the most\r\n     conservative and sought-for investments.\r\n\r\n     Fifth--Because there will be rights attaching to it almost\r\n     at its beginning that will give to it large profits\r\n     independent of those accruing from its dividends.\r\n\r\n     The fact that the above values are now known to some, and\r\n     will be in the next few days recognized by all, will cause\r\n     the stock to be largely oversubscribed, but this should\r\n     deter no one from subscribing, for the reason that,\r\n     notwithstanding this certainty, those who are engaged in\r\n     perfecting this great enterprise have decided that instead\r\n     of a favored few being allotted the entire amount, all shall\r\n     be treated alike. Captious critics of \"Coppers\" will\r\n     probably again cry their sarcastic \"philanthropy,\" but to\r\n     the legion of broad-minded investors who have followed and\r\n     profited by this great industrial revolution, the policy of\r\n     this liberal treatment will be obvious--the consolidated\r\n     company is to be many times larger than its present capital\r\n     indicates; it, in my opinion, will from time to time offer\r\n     to the investing public large amounts of increased stock for\r\n     the purpose of obtaining hundreds of millions of cash with\r\n     which to pay for all the producing copper mines, as it is\r\n     now obvious to students of affairs financial that this\r\n     company must in time become the owner of all good mines,\r\n     because all such mines can be run to better advantage to the\r\n     consumer of copper, the investor in copper stocks and the\r\n     present owners, by the Amalgamated Company than by others.\r\n     This being so it requires no supernaturally bright mind to\r\n     see the wisdom of a policy that insures a constantly\r\n     increasing premium for every new issue of stock.\r\n\r\n     I advise all intending subscribers to send their\r\n     subscriptions personally or through their banking or\r\n     brokerage house direct to the National City Bank of New\r\n     York. While my firm will, for the convenience of its\r\n     clients, forward subscriptions, I would have it understood\r\n     that such subscribers will receive the same treatment if\r\n     they send their applications direct.\r\n\r\n     My firm will also furnish subscription blanks to those who,\r\n     through lack of time or otherwise, cannot secure them\r\n     elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     All subscribers should bear in mind, if on receiving their\r\n     allotment they are disappointed with the amount, that their\r\n     subscription is only reduced in the same ratio as all\r\n     others, and that they have the pledge from a Board of\r\n     Directors whose personnel means good faith.\r\n\r\n     In again advising the purchase of \"Amalgamated\" I call\r\n     attention to the names of the men who are to conduct it to a\r\n     future, and to the fact that from its inception it will\r\n     surely give a return of over 8 per cent. per annum on its\r\n     par.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON.]\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely necessary, Mr. Rogers,\" I returned without an instant's\r\nhesitation. \"Now let us run over the situation finally, for I want to\r\nrelieve your mind of the idea that I am doing anything selfish in\r\ninsisting on these conditions. When the public subscription is offered,\r\nthere must be a story of facts to go with it. Some one must make it. The\r\nmen who should, will not, although they are prepared to reap all the\r\nbenefits of what the man who will, says. It seems I am that man, and\r\nwhat I say must be what I understand is the exact truth about the\r\nenterprise. Well and good. It is essential for the one who assumes this\r\nresponsibility to do it in such a way that he can for all time show that\r\nthe men who benefited and upon whose say-so he acted were in every way\r\nresponsible for what he did. All this is undeniable. There are only two\r\npossible considerations that enter into the problem: first, that the\r\nfacts I am to state are not true; second, that it devolves on me to\r\naccept a risk those associated with me will not take. If the first can\r\nbe maintained, farewell to our enterprise, and get ready for the worst\r\nfinancial scandal Wall Street ever faced. If it's the last--Mr. Rogers,\r\nthe 'Standard Oil' people are all very strong, but I don't believe any\r\nof them would have the nerve to ask me to accept a risk they dared not\r\nthemselves undertake.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no escaping my conclusion, and unwelcome as the fact was, he\r\nsaw no further talk would avail, so he snapped:\r\n\r\n\"Draw up the advertisements you think proper. Have them ready in an\r\nhour, and I will in the meantime see William Rockefeller and Stillman\r\nand do what is necessary.\"\r\n\r\nI noted the set of Henry H. Rogers' jaw and the down slant of his eyelid\r\nas he uttered these words, and I had no doubt of the compliance of James\r\nStillman and William Rockefeller with whatever demands he chose to\r\npropose that day. \"Cyclones and thunderbolts! Heaven help these or any\r\nothers who venture to resist him in this mood,\" I inwardly commented,\r\n\"especially if they are of those with whom he has travelled the\r\n'Standard Oil' blood-trail.\" My imagination showed me a picture of 26\r\nBroadway and the National City Bank swaying and shaking like full-blown\r\nhollyhocks in a gale.\r\n\r\nI had my advertisements ready and was waiting when he returned.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" said he peremptorily, \"if your work will pass me you may go\r\nahead with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you have obtained all the consents necessary?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL ADVERTISEMENT OF AMALGAMATED COPPER COMPANY.\r\n\r\n     =Amalgamated Copper Co.=\r\n\r\n     =Capital................$75,000,000=\r\n\r\n     This company is organized under the laws of the State of New\r\n     Jersey for the purpose of purchasing and operating\r\n     copper-producing properties.

The\r\nadvertisements you can convince me are right you may have inserted in\r\nthe papers, and no one will say a word publicly or otherwise. Neither\r\nWilliam Rockefeller, his son, Stillman, the Bank nor any officer or\r\ndirector of the Amalgamated Company will talk until after the\r\nsubscriptions have been closed and the allotments made; not one word\r\nbut what you say or print will be uttered. Can you ask anything more\r\nthan that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing more.\"\r\n\r\nI then laid out the rough copies of what afterward appeared in the\r\npapers throughout the country (reproduced on pages 336 and 338).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CRIME OF AMALGAMATED\r\n\r\n\r\nThat those of my readers who are not versed in stock affairs may\r\nappreciate the unusual character of these announcements, it is proper\r\nfor me to explain their divergence from the form of the average\r\nfinancial advertisement. It is the invariable custom in all stock\r\nsubscriptions for the corporation which is being offered for sale, or\r\nthe bank or bankers assuming responsibility for the proposition, to set\r\nforth at length the facts essential to a proper understanding of the\r\nenterprise: if a new corporation, its reason for existence and the\r\nsecurity offered; if old, its history and the immediate purposes for\r\nwhich additional funds are asked. It is the same in finance as in\r\nordinary business. If you are offering for sale goods which cannot speak\r\nfor themselves, it is necessary that some one talk for them so those who\r\npurchase may know what they are receiving for their money. Under normal\r\ncircumstances the initial advertisement of the Amalgamated Company would\r\nhave stated the amount of its capital, its organization, and that the\r\nproceeds of the $75,000,000 of stock offered for sale were to go into\r\nits treasury to purchase designated properties. It will be seen from the\r\nAmalgamated's advertisement reproduced herewith, that all the\r\ninformation vouchsafed intending investors is mention of its $75,000,000\r\ncapital, that it has no bonds or mortgage debt, and that it has already\r\npurchased large interests in the Anaconda and other copper properties.\r\nNot a word about indebtedness, equally vital, nor in definition of the\r\nextent of the interests owned. It is quite the briefest, most meagre\r\nnotice of subscription ever placed before the public. Indeed, it is\r\ninformative and specific only in regard to the officers, who are given\r\nextraordinary prominence. Such announcements are usually signed by the\r\npresident and the secretary and treasurer, or else the names of all the\r\nofficers and directors are stated, so it is obvious here that the\r\nprominent insertion of the vice-president's name is for a purpose. And\r\nall Wall Street as well as the general public gathered that \"Standard\r\nOil\" was so sure of this enterprise that its principal men were anxious\r\nto be known as being behind it.\r\n\r\nThe offer of the National City Bank begins with a reference to \"the\r\nforegoing statement,\" as though that really showed the purpose of the\r\nsale of stock--leaving the inference that the beneficiary was the\r\nAmalgamated Company. Other details--the designation of conditions of\r\nsubscription, terms, etc., follow the ordinary form. In the matter of\r\noversubscription the offer diverges vitally. Usually it is prescribed\r\nthat \"in case of oversubscription stock will be allotted pro rata and\r\nthe right is reserved to reject any subscription in whole _or in part_.\"\r\nIn preparing the advertisement I purposely left out the \"or in part,\"\r\nthereby making it impossible to reject any part of any subscription--in\r\nother words, rejection had to be without compromise, so that every\r\nsubscriber whose subscription was not wholly rejected would stand on\r\nequal terms with every other subscriber, as he would receive his exact\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nThe terms of these advertisements prescribed the conditions under which\r\nsubscriptions for the stock of the Amalgamated Copper Company must be\r\nmade to the National City Bank, and bound the bank to accept\r\nsubscriptions presented in compliance therewith. In fact they\r\nconstituted a legal contract binding the National City Bank, an\r\ninstitution doing business under the national banking laws of the United\r\nStates, to allot to every subscriber whose subscription was not rejected\r\nin full, his proportionate part of the entire 750,000 shares of the\r\ncapital stock of the corporation, his proportionate part being the ratio\r\nhis subscription bore to the entire subscription received at the\r\nNational City Bank before twelve noon of Thursday, May 4, 1899. On\r\nreceipt of official notification from the National City Bank that he had\r\nbeen allotted twenty per cent. of his subscription, or one share in\r\nevery five subscribed for, the subscriber had a right to think he knew\r\nthat the total subscription to the stock had been five times\r\n$75,000,000--$375,000,000--or five times 750,000 shares--3,750,000\r\nshares; and that before noon, May 4th, the National City Bank had in\r\nhand certified checks to the amount of $18,750,000. The public,\r\nincluding the shrewdest Wall Streeters, has, since the subscription\r\nclosed, believed that the subscription totalled the figures given above.\r\nIndeed no one has ever suspected anything to the contrary, because it\r\nwas clear that if the allotment was conducted under conditions other\r\nthan those contracted for in the advertisement, the National City Bank\r\nhad laid itself open to a charge of fraud and was liable to each\r\nsubscriber for the proportion of shares of which he had been deprived.\r\n\r\n_The actual amount of the subscriptions received on or before noon, May\r\n4, 1899, at the National City Bank was but $132,067,500, and the amount\r\nof the five per cent. certified checks received in the institution up to\r\nnoon was only $6,603,375, or $5 per share on a total of 1,320,675\r\nshares._\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this is that every legitimate subscriber--and I except\r\nthe millions of subscriptions which the bank decided were illegitimate\r\nand rejected, as they had a perfect right to do under their contract\r\nwith the public--was defrauded of two shares of each three to which he\r\nwas entitled. Before me as I write is the original allotment of the\r\nNational City Bank to the subscribers, which I propose to print in my\r\nsecond volume as part of this indictment, showing that the figures are\r\nexactly as I have stated.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of my narrative I have claimed that the frauds\r\ncommitted in connection with Amalgamated could be completely\r\ndemonstrated from records outside any evidence of mine. The list of\r\nsubscribers and the most cursory examination by the Government national\r\nbank authorities at Washington will furnish all the proof necessary to\r\nsubstantiate the accuracy of my statement here. At this juncture I shall\r\nnot attempt to sum up the bearing or the consequences of this illegal\r\nand dishonest act, but it was one of the main cogs in bringing about the\r\ndisaster that ensued. The conditions which led to its perpetration are\r\nnarrated later. In passing I may say that while the formation of the\r\nAmalgamated Company by the clerks and office boys (as I have already\r\ndescribed it) and the means by which Mr. Rogers and Mr. Rockefeller let\r\nin their friends to their appointed \"floors\" were deceptive and\r\noutrageous in their double-dealing, and should be prohibited by law, I\r\nknew them to be so commonly practised throughout our American financial\r\ncentres that it never entered my mind to suggest that they were\r\ncriminal. The infraction I have just explained, however, is a tangible\r\nfraud and a very different proposition.\r\n\r\nThe two announcements alone would have had but little efficacy in\r\npersuading the public to part with its money for Amalgamated stock, but\r\nin conjunction with the third advertisement--mine--they proved\r\nirresistible. There was nothing equivocal in my announcement. I not only\r\nadvised the purchase of the stock by subscription on the ground that it\r\nwas the best opportunity for safe and profitable investment ever offered\r\nthe people, but asserted that the shares could afterward be sold for\r\nfifty to seventy-five per cent. advance on the subscription price, so\r\nthat every one who obtained a share of Amalgamated for $100 was buying\r\nsomething which would subsequently be worth $150 to $200. Further I\r\npromised that all the subscribers should be treated alike and gave it as\r\nmy opinion that the whole 750,000 shares could at the time the public\r\nwas reading my statement be sold for thirty to sixty per cent. more than\r\nthe subscription price, and declared unqualifiedly that the assets owned\r\nby the Amalgamated Company were worth from one hundred to one hundred\r\nand twenty-five millions; that the company was then earning from twelve\r\nto sixteen per cent. per annum, and that from the start and ever\r\nafterward it would pay eight per cent. dividends annually.\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, I had no personal knowledge of the\r\nconditions in the several properties comprising the first section of\r\nAmalgamated, but the facts and figures which were put forward in this\r\nadvertisement were supplied me by Henry H. Rogers and through him by\r\nMarcus Daly, who vouched for them, and furthermore the three\r\nadvertisements were carefully read and scanned by Mr. Rogers himself.\r\nIf I had not believed them to be true I should not have put them\r\nforward nor allowed them to be published, but I accepted them as the\r\npublic and the financiers did when they read them over the signature of\r\nthe known agent and mouthpiece for Amalgamated and \"Standard Oil,\"\r\nmyself. I showed that I believed them by putting my signature to them. I\r\nwas and am personally responsible for the truth of these statements, but\r\nmore so are H. H. Rogers, William G. Rockefeller, the National City\r\nBank, and the Amalgamated Company. Even if it had not been a matter of\r\npublic knowledge that I was the agent of the City Bank and the\r\nAmalgamated Company and the \"Standard Oil\" party; if it had not been a\r\nfact, as it was, that I inserted these three advertisements by agreement\r\nwith those who were responsible for them and who were doing business\r\ndirectly with the public; if it had not been a fact that these people\r\nthrough me paid for these advertisements, thereby directly showing I was\r\ntheir authorized agent; if I had not taken the precaution to see that\r\nsuch payment was made by a check signed by William G. Rockefeller,\r\ntreasurer of the Amalgamated Company, and yet made to the order of the\r\nnewspaper people and handed by me to them, thereby clinching my agency,\r\nnevertheless the advertisement itself would have made it clear that I\r\nwas the full and authorized agent, or it would have been stopped there\r\nand then and the bank and the company would have refused to proceed\r\nfurther, for I say:\r\n\r\n     \"I advise all intending subscribers to send their\r\n     subscriptions personally or through their banking or\r\n     brokerage house direct to the National City Bank of New\r\n     York. While my firm will, for the convenience of its\r\n     clients, forward subscriptions, I would have it understood\r\n     that such subscribers will receive the same treatment if\r\n     they send their applications direct.\r\n\r\n     \"My firm will also furnish subscription blanks to those who,\r\n     through lack of time or otherwise, cannot secure them\r\n     elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nI think I have made clear so far the conditions under which these vital\r\nstatements were put forward and have lodged the legal responsibility for\r\nthem where it belongs. The National City Bank is plainly liable for\r\nviolation of the published stipulations under which subscriptions were\r\nallotted, and it is common knowledge that the stock was allotted one\r\nshare in five subscribed for, while the original list of subscriptions\r\nshows that the total allotment was less than twenty-seven millions and\r\nthe full subscription less than double the amount to be allotted.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that the dividends were cut to two per cent., and\r\nare at the present time, the best ever known in the copper business,\r\nonly four per cent., and that they have been cut under eight per cent.,\r\nso they either could not have been twelve to sixteen per cent. at the\r\ntime it was stated they were, or there has been great fraud committed\r\nsince. As we are dealing with the greatest national bank in the country,\r\nit will be simple for the Government and banking officials at Washington\r\ninstantly to disprove my statements if they are false; otherwise they\r\nmust take action, civil and criminal, against the National City Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE SUBSCRIPTION OPENS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rogers on returning from his conference with James Stillman and\r\nWilliam Rockefeller had given the word that the course was clear, I was\r\nconscious of the necessity of clinching the decision so that there could\r\nbe no further backing and filling. I told Mr. Rogers so and suggested\r\nthat we insert at once the advertisement of the City Bank and the\r\nAmalgamated Company in the New York papers, and that the following day I\r\nhave arrangements concluded with my advertising agents for their\r\npublication throughout the country. The announcements appeared in New\r\nYork and the following day they were spread before the public in the\r\ngreat papers of this country and England. Thus was Amalgamated launched.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of these long anticipated announcements the pent-up\r\ncopper excitement burst forth, and an avalanche of queries began to pour\r\nin upon us all. The interest was tremendous, and I felt certain we were\r\nto reap a greater success than I had dared dream of. The days preceding\r\nthe opening of the subscription were taken up in answering a thousand\r\nquestions regarding conditions, in supervising the advertising, and\r\nsteering \"Coppers\" in the market. On the eve of the opening day Mr.\r\nRogers said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, at last we are to know how well your work has been done. The\r\ntime of talk ends to-night and after that we'll have facts to go upon.\r\nWhat do you place the subscription at?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll stake my prospective profits that when the books close there will\r\nbe from forty to fifty millions subscribed and that when your 'Standard\r\nOil' experts have analyzed the subscriptions they will tell you that\r\nthree-quarters of all have come from the country--from my campaign--and\r\nnot over a quarter from the 'Standard Oil's' following and Wall Street,\"\r\nI answered. \"Then you and Mr. Rockefeller will admit I was right when I\r\ntold you that the public will respond to open and fair treatment when it\r\nis deaf and blind to stock trickery and manipulation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do hope you are right,\" returned Mr. Rogers, in a quiet, earnest,\r\nI-pray-it-may-really-be-so tone, \"but if it is from six to ten millions\r\nwe will all take off our hats to you.\"\r\n\r\nThis defined the expectation of the man who above all others knew most\r\nof what had been done to mature and perfect the venture. I realized that\r\nnone of the parties to the enterprise anticipated an extraordinary\r\nsuccess, and though I felt more confident than the others, I was far\r\nfrom cognizant of the actual feeling abroad among the people. Monday\r\nmorning I got an inkling of what was coming. My office in Boston was the\r\ncentre of a dense mass of people from morning until night, and round the\r\nNational City Bank in New York crowds were gathered watching the throng\r\nfight its way through the doors. Inside, a long line of men and women\r\nheaded for the subscription desk stood laden with checks and currency,\r\npatiently awaiting their turn, and every mail brought sacks of orders.\r\nThe big banking and brokerage offices in the financial districts of\r\nBoston, Philadelphia, and New York were packed with customers asking to\r\nbe shown the way to secure as much as possible of this easy money, while\r\nthe wires buzzed with messages and bids from the far West and from\r\nEurope. The excitement knew no bounds. In my rooms at the Waldorf I sat\r\nbeside the telephone getting rapid reports from my lieutenants. From 26\r\nBroadway I learned of the progress of events at the bank, and was\r\nimpressed with the fact that the prevailing excitement and the strain\r\nwere beginning to affect even the nickel-steel equilibrium of Mr. Rogers\r\nhimself. Indeed, he made no attempt to disguise his uneasiness, and told\r\nme that William Rockefeller was in much the same condition. It was the\r\nfirst venture of size these two strong wheelmen of \"Standard Oil\" had\r\nundertaken without the co-operation of John D. Rockefeller, and it\r\nappeared that he was considerably worked up over the public hubbub, and\r\nso opposed to the whole Amalgamated affair that nothing short of a great\r\nsuccess could justify his subordinates' temerity. However one looked at\r\nthe situation, it was evident that Henry H. Rogers and William\r\nRockefeller were playing for the stake of their lives, though how great\r\nthe stake was no one at that time guessed. Since then they have steadily\r\nforged ahead, both in riches and in influence, until to-day they have\r\nactually supplanted John D. Rockefeller in the kingship of finance. At\r\nthat day, though his had always been the master-mind of \"Standard Oil,\"\r\nI don't believe Mr. Rogers was worth, all told, over twelve to fifteen\r\nmillions, while to-day he is probably a hundred and fifty times a\r\nmillionnaire.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that there was good cause for trepidation over\r\nthis venture, for though the stock markets buzzed with \"Coppers\" it was\r\nall guesswork as to how far the public would go with us. The question\r\nwas, What would they do now that our stock was within their reach? It\r\nwas a tremendous proposition we had put forth, for remember this was\r\nbefore the period of the great trustifications, and ten to twenty\r\nmillions figured as the limit of large flotations. Even these were of\r\nwell-known properties and invariably were offered below par. To come\r\ninto the open, offering at $100 a share a brand-new stock capitalized at\r\n$75,000,000, was breaking the record, and we might well wonder what was\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nSo far as man could do I had safeguarded the public and my own\r\nreputation, and believed that the assurances I had secured eliminated\r\nall opportunities of fleecing investors. Mr. Rogers and Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhad each pledged me his solemn word, under no circumstances to sell to\r\nsubscribers over five million dollars of the stock, and to place at my\r\ndisposal the five millions cash received, to use in the open market for\r\nthe purpose of protecting the stock so that it should never decline\r\nbelow par. That this promise should be kept was of the utmost\r\nconsequence. While \"Standard Oil\" held the large majority of the\r\nAmalgamated stock and the public but a small minority, there was no\r\ndanger of the latter being slaughtered, whereas if the public was loaded\r\nup with stock at $100 per share, it would be profitable for Rogers,\r\nRockefeller, and Stillman to practise the method I was fast beginning to\r\nsee was their favorite device for accumulating wealth--selling stock and\r\nthen dropping its price and taking it away from its holders at\r\ntwenty-five to fifty per cent. below what they had purchased it at. If\r\nmy plan of guarding against this possibility were adhered to, I knew\r\nthat there would be such a demand for the shares in the open market\r\nafter the allotment that when the second section of seventy-five or one\r\nhundred millions came to be offered, it would be even more eagerly\r\nsought than the first. So with the third and other sections\r\ncontemplated, until in time the whole stock would be distributed among\r\nthe investors of the world, and assuming that part of our enormous\r\nprofits would always be used to keep up its market price, there could be\r\nno possible decline. Thus Amalgamated, like \"Standard Oil\" or a\r\nGovernment bond, must always be worth more than par, first because there\r\nwould be value to justify it, and second because its holders would have\r\nabsolute confidence that the security could always be sold for as much\r\nor more than they had paid for it.\r\n\r\nSo far, I had carefully refrained from discussing with Mr. Rogers how we\r\nshould go about securing our part of the subscription. I had not\r\nforgotten it. Indeed, I had it well in mind and was ready to enter upon\r\nthe matter when it came up. An iron-bound contract held the Amalgamated\r\nCompany and the National City Bank over the signatures of a Rogers, a\r\nRockefeller, and a Stillman to allow the public to subscribe for\r\n$75,000,000 of stock, and the terms were that every subscription must be\r\nin the bank at noon, May 4th, and that each subscription must be\r\naccompanied by a certified check of $5 for every share applied for. _As\r\nwe had agreed that the public should be sold but five millions of the\r\nstock, that meant that we proposed to retain seventy millions of it\r\nourselves, but to obtain this allotment legally, we must comply with the\r\nconditions of the advertisement exactly as outsiders had. So it was\r\nnecessary that we have a bid in before noon on Thursday for our seventy\r\nmillions, accompanied by a check for_ $3,500,000, _which would secure us\r\nour quota provided the public subscription was no more than five\r\nmillions._ If the public subscription ran over five millions, then the\r\nbank must throw out all additional subscriptions over that amount, for\r\nthe advertised contract specifically declared that all accepted\r\nsubscriptions would be allowed pro rata. By my suppression of the usual\r\ncondition that the Bank reserve the right to reject any part of any\r\nsubscription, it was absolutely precluded from the common method of\r\ndealing with such an emergency and so could not reject _parts_ of\r\nsubscriptions. There was a way out--without practising fraud. If at noon\r\non Thursday the public had subscribed ten or fifteen millions then the\r\ninsiders must put in bids of $140,000,000 to $210,000,000, in which\r\nevent the entire subscription would be divided by allotting each\r\nsubscriber one share for every two or three subscribed.\r\n\r\nI presumed then that some such method would be followed. It surprised me\r\nat the time that Mr. Rogers should have given so little attention to so\r\nvital a part of our programme, for he is in the habit of thoughtfully\r\nthumbing over just such details to avoid slip-ups, but the idea that our\r\nsubscription would run into unwieldy amounts never occurred to him, and\r\nhe let things go, trusting to luck and \"Standard Oil's\" motto \"To Hell\r\nwith the people anyway,\" to adjust the matter at the last moment. To-day\r\nHenry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller, and James Stillman would each give\r\nfive millions from his private fortune if this seemingly unimportant\r\ndetail had then been provided for. Its neglect is the bloody\r\nfinger-print on the knife-handle of the murderer, it is the burglar's\r\nfootprint in the snow. In this case it furnishes the evidence of the\r\ncrime of Amalgamated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nDOLLAR HYDROPHOBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first fears of failure were soon succeeded by apprehensions of a\r\ndifferent nature. By Tuesday noon it was evident that the flotation\r\nwould far exceed the low expectations of Rogers and Rockefeller, and I\r\nknew that if the people's interest continued to develop at the rate the\r\nsubscriptions indicated, the totals would be far ahead of my own most\r\nsanguine anticipations. Every hour the excitement intensified. The\r\ncrowds on the street and in the brokers' offices; the rush of investors\r\nto the City Bank--all demonstrated a feverish condition of the public\r\nmind, a state of unrest that fills the conservative banker with dread\r\nlest something happen to precipitate a disorder and a panic. The acute\r\nsensitiveness of a body of investors to extraneous influence, however\r\nslight, is familiar to any one who has had to do with market\r\nmanipulation. In a theatre or church one strenuous spirit can quell a\r\ntumult with some ringing assurance, but long before the leader of a\r\nfinancial movement has got word to his following, wide-spread over the\r\ncountry, it has taken alarm, the rout has begun, and the field is strewn\r\nwith corpses. A great financial excitement, like a rocket, should soar\r\ntriumphantly into the air, leaving behind it a comet-like trail of\r\nglory, climaxing in a shower of gold; diverted from its course, it runs\r\na mad, brief, tragic career along the earth, spreading ruin and disaster\r\nin its path.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when all great enterprises must emerge from the\r\nnursery and be exposed to the sunlight and the breezes of every day. We\r\nwere crossing the ominous tract which divides the trenches of\r\npreparation from the sheltering fortress of attainment, and the hosts\r\nof failure were rallied to dispute our passage.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture any accident to our venture might affect the whole\r\nAmerican business fabric, and no one realized the danger of the\r\nsituation better than Mr. Rogers and myself. During the anxious days\r\nthat were passing we canvassed the dire possibilities that the situation\r\ncontained, just as children tell each other ghost stories when left\r\nalone in the darkness of the night. The great catastrophes of finance,\r\nwe remembered, had all been born of the unexpected--of unforeseen\r\ncontingencies--far beyond the range of human foresight. Who knew but\r\nthat the hours were pregnant with some terrible potentiality--the\r\nassassination of a king or president, a Chicago or Boston fire, an\r\nepidemic of cholera, a belligerent message from the President, such as\r\nCleveland's Venezuela ultimatum, a great bank defalcation, the suicide\r\nof an important operator, the death of an eminent capitalist--a breath\r\nof one of these world cyclones would crumble our structure into the dust\r\nand take along with it the neighboring edifices on both sides of the\r\nstreet. There were also the hidden possibilities of betrayal, of\r\ntreachery, for we knew that scores of Wall Street's most ingenious minds\r\nwere bent on unravelling and exposing the secret threads of our\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning soon after ten o'clock Mr. Rogers, on his way\r\ndowntown, came to the Waldorf. He was plainly excited.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"this is something unheard of, unprecedented. The\r\nbank is being buried under subscriptions. Stillman says he is adding\r\nscores of clerks, but that he cannot possibly keep pace with the\r\nsubscriptions. Mr. Rockefeller is very nervous, and I must confess to\r\nfeeling a bit of 'rattle' myself. It now looks as though the total would\r\nrun into fabulous figures. The Lewisohns are being swamped with orders\r\nfrom Europe. They alone will probably put in more than ten millions.\r\nWall Street has lost its head entirely, and our people at 26 Broadway\r\nare coming in asking advice and doubling and trebling their\r\nsubscriptions. If we don't keep our heads something bad may happen, for\r\nit looks now as though the cash the subscription is tying up would make\r\na money-pinch. This affair must not be allowed to run away with us. What\r\ndo your reports from Boston and the country show?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same as yours. The people have simply gone wild. Calls come in\r\nceaselessly to me from Wall Street men. The hotel is so full of brokers\r\nfrom out of town that they are placing cots in the big rooms. I went\r\ndown into the office just now to talk to them and was nearly mobbed.\r\nAlready they are talking of a premium of $40 to $60 per share, but if we\r\nkeep to the line we have laid down, I don't think we need fear bad\r\nconsequences.\"\r\n\r\nWe discussed other aspects of the affair, the intense interest developed\r\nin Europe, and the effect of the excitement on the price of the metal.\r\nAs he started to go down to his office, Mr. Rogers said, as though by\r\nway of an after-thought:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, if the people are so hungry, why should we not take some\r\nadvantage of it?\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion, with all it implied, stunned me for a second.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Rogers? Take advantage--how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be well to let the subscribers have more than the amount\r\nwe agreed? Why not take more of this money than five millions?\"\r\n\r\nThis was out of a clear sky, for there had not been the slightest\r\nsuggestion of a change of programme and I had rested in the certainty\r\nthat our plan insured the safety of all who had gone in on my say-so. I\r\nchoked down my excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Mr. Rogers, are you mad?\" I exclaimed. \"Don't let us depart a\r\nhair from what we all in our cool moments decided was best. We are in\r\nthe field now. It would be sure ruin to try any new schemes at this\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are rattled yourself, Lawson. There's no need for excitement. I\r\nmerely offered the suggestion. Everything is going well,\" he reassured\r\nme, but the picture his words conjured before my mind disturbed me all\r\nday. That he would dare do what he had suggested I did not credit, for\r\nthe assurances I had were too solemn to allow me to believe such\r\ntreachery could be meditated. Nevertheless I brooded over the matter,\r\nand late in the afternoon ran down to 26 Broadway, ostensibly to hear\r\nthe latest news from the bank, but really to try if I could not look\r\ninto Mr. Rogers' head and see if the imps I had sighted early in the day\r\nwere still there.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers was over with Stillman at the bank. In half an hour he came\r\nin, and the excitement he labored under was plainly evident in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"no one has ever seen anything like this before.\r\nStillman is bewildered. He says it looks as though by to-morrow there\r\nwill be a mob around the bank doors, and if between now and then\r\nanything unusual should happen, there'll be the devil to pay sure. I\r\ntell you I'm so tired out that I'm going home now to rest up.\"\r\n\r\nTogether we went uptown on the Elevated, and when I left him at\r\nThirty-third Street to cross over to my hotel, somehow the dark\r\nforebodings of the morning had been lulled by his frank geniality and\r\ncarried away by his enthusiastic rejoicings in the success of our\r\nenterprise. The picture of that soft spring evening hangs in my memory's\r\ngallery--the declining sun seen through a long perspective of gilded\r\nbrick and brownstone façades, the heavy rumble of trains, the clamor of\r\nnewsboys crying last editions, the packed cable-cars slowly threading\r\ntheir way amid the hurrying crowds of clerks and shop girls streaming\r\nhomeward, the cabs swinging in and out of the throng, through whose\r\nwindows I caught glimpses of jewels on bare shoulders, light silks, and\r\nsweeping plumes--the butterflies of fashion or folly hurrying out on\r\ntheir evening trysts. Broadway, with its hundreds of sights and sounds,\r\nwas before me in the hour of its transformation, the street lamps\r\nbreaking into incandescence, and the huge electric signs beginning to\r\nglare above the theatre entrances. By the time I reached the Waldorf,\r\nthat high abode of Yankee royalty, the kinks and curlicues were so far\r\nironed from my nerves and brain that I had little doubt of my ability to\r\ntake a fall out of Fate in whatever sort of collar-and-elbow tussle she\r\nmight designate. In this mood I swung into the huge hotel through the\r\ncarriage entrance on Thirty-fourth Street, eager to forget myself amid\r\nthe rapt concourse of dollar worshippers, preening themselves against\r\nthe plush, onyx, and gildings of the Astor caravansary. I seemed to see\r\nin the mirrors, on the walls, on the buttons of the lackeys' livery, in\r\nthe patterns of the rugs, inscribed on the tessellated floors and\r\npainted on the lofty ceilings, dazzling and glittering, the universal\r\ncrest of the twisted S with its two upright bars.\r\n\r\n_Dollars, dollars, dollars._\r\n\r\nThrough the office I pushed, my path disputed by the hosts of Croesus\r\nin ambush for market information. Colonels and generals of the\r\nalmighty-dollar army were on either flank of me, and the air was thick\r\nwith the echo and the rumor of millions. At last I found myself in the\r\nhigh and splendid room, with its tall windows elaborately curtained with\r\nvelvet, its floor space studded with small tables, where after four\r\no'clock any afternoon, the year round, you will find the active Wall\r\nStreet contingent busily discussing the day's doings and plotting good\r\nor evil for the morrow. There they all were, that eventful evening, in\r\nparties of seven or eight clustered at the little tables, and as I\r\nentered a vigorous hail caught my ear and again I found myself\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down a minute, Lawson,\" said ex-Congressman Jefferson M.\r\nLevy--\"Jeff Levy\" in Wall Street--\"and tell us about Amalgamated. I\r\nsuppose there's not a chance to get what one wants unless one subscribes\r\nfor five or ten times more than one needs, but if you say that's\r\nstraight, I'll put in another subscription for ----.\"\r\n\r\nIn the group were sitting \"Harry\" Weil, who time and again has tied tin\r\ncans to Wall Street's tail; big, bluff, honest \"Billy\" Oliver, whose\r\n\"I'll take ten thousand more\" is as familiar to Stock Exchange members\r\nas the sound of the gong; and little \"Jakey\" Field, most audacious and\r\nresourceful of floor operators, graduated but a few years ago from the\r\nranks of Wall Street's errand boys--\"Jakey\" Field, who is able\r\nsingle-handed to turn a \"bear\" market in a rout by \"bidding 'em up all\r\nround the room five thousand at a crack\"--which means he dares buy one\r\nhundred thousand shares off the reel in a demoralized market when every\r\none is selling, thus standing to make or lose a million or two on his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThey listened, breathless, while I poured out the story of the terrific\r\nrush of Amalgamated subscribers. Another group hailed me and I recounted\r\nthe same story. So it went all over the busy assemblage--\"_dollars,\r\ndollars, dollars_,\" how to get them, how to get them quick. The money\r\ntalk ebbed and flowed; the chink of dollars echoed in the rattle of\r\nchina, in the tinkling of glasses, in the laughs and salutations, in the\r\nshuffle of feet. It was the one word, the single theme, the alpha and\r\nomega of all these men of talent and virility who accorded me\r\nrecognition as one of themselves and assumed that I, too, was crucified\r\nto the two bars on the snaky S; the whole thing was so interesting that\r\nI lost sight of the terrible seriousness of it, and I chuckled as one\r\ndoes when one sits on the cool grass under the apple-trees in summer and\r\nwatches myriads of ants hustling and jostling and bumping over each\r\nother to get away with what to humans is but a tiny grain of dirt.\r\n\r\nAs I arose to go at last, the head waiter came forward and led me into a\r\ncorner, where his assistant and the chef awaited me. All with tremendous\r\nearnestness asked, \"Is it safe, Mr. Lawson, for us to put our savings in\r\nAmalgamated?\" They took my breath away by telling me they proposed to\r\nsubscribe for one thousand, five hundred, and two hundred shares each,\r\n$100,000, $50,000, and $20,000 worth, if I but said the word.\r\n\r\n\"_Dollars, dollars, dollars_\" beat a tattoo on my ear-drums as the rain\r\nused to on the roof at the old farmhouse.\r\n\r\nA moment later Manager Thomas of the great hotel slipped up to me. \"I'm\r\nin for a thousand or two, if you say the word,\" he whispered. At dinner\r\nmy old waiter, who I would have sworn did not know a stock certificate\r\nfrom a dog license, bent over respectfully to tell me that twenty of the\r\nboys had chipped in and desired me to take their thousand dollars and\r\nput it up for two hundred shares--$20,000 worth more. Room Clerk Palmer\r\ncalled over to me as I went by his desk a moment later to say he was\r\ngoing in for three hundred shares if it broke him. And so it\r\nwent--bell-boys, chambermaids, valets, elevator men, all begging an\r\ninterview, and all with the same request--\"Would I not put their savings\r\ninto this magic money-maker?\"\r\n\r\nAll were friends or protégés of mine, these managers, clerks, stewards,\r\nand waiters. Their money was more sacred to me than my own. I had been\r\ninstrumental in bringing many of them up to the palace of American\r\ndollar royalty from the old Brunswick, and I would rather have lost a\r\nfinger any day than have jeopardized their savings. For all of them I\r\nhad but one answer: \"Go your limit.\"\r\n\r\nI looked over the memoranda and telegrams piled high on the table in my\r\nroom, all recording the whirlwind sweep of this tremendous copper\r\nmovement that I had set a-booming.\r\n\r\n\"_Dollars, dollars, dollars._\"\r\n\r\nRequests from friends for some of the easy money I was dispensing to the\r\npublic, appeals from old associates for special allotments of the\r\nsubscription, urgent petitions from capitalists and bankers with whom I\r\nhad business relations that their bids for shares should have\r\npreference, perfumed notes on tinted paper in feminine handwriting\r\nbegging aid, advice, my influence, on a hundred specious pleas. It\r\nseemed to me that all the world was in a conspiracy of dollars and I the\r\none object of its plotting. For a moment there overcame me a sickening\r\ndisgust at this universal greed, at this all-absorbing passion for gold\r\nwhich my momentary pre-eminence revealed to my view. Then sanity\r\nasserted itself, and I remembered that if there was a conspiracy I was\r\nits ringleader, that I myself for months past had thought intensely of\r\nnothing but dollars. Why, then, should I resent the eager desires of\r\nothers to attach to their own bank accounts some of the money which I\r\nwas proclaiming from the housetops any one who desired might have for\r\nthe asking? Many of these men, moreover, who sought my assurance of the\r\nsafety of their little ventures, had earned the private word by\r\nthoughtful service and friendly attentions. Dollars were food and drink\r\nand fine raiment; were music, pictures, and theatres; were horses and\r\ndogs; were green fields, blossoming trees, and the open air of heaven;\r\nwere liberty, release from sordid cares, from servitude--and why should\r\nI, who had helped myself in bountiful measure to the good things in\r\nlife's cornucopia, feel superior when confronted by the lusts I myself\r\nhad been instrumental in arousing? I laughed at my egregious virtue and\r\ndropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nDEVILTRY AFOOT\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, May 4, 1899, dawned as fair a spring morning as ever set off\r\nsacrificial rite or triumphal jubilee--a day of buoyant, delicious airs\r\nwhich set the blood throbbing in the veins and ambition thrilling in the\r\nheart--a day for action, achievement, for wild gallops along country\r\nlanes, for swift motion on land or water. I looked out of my lofty\r\nparlor window far up Fifth Avenue's long vista of mansions and palaces\r\nto where the sunlight glittered on the tender verdancy of Central Park.\r\nA trickle of cabs and carriages headed southward already had begun the\r\ndescent to Wall Street. Almost the first call over the telephone came\r\nfrom Mr. Rogers, asking for the morning's news. I told him there was not\r\na cloud on our sky, not a single breeze but blew from the right quarter\r\nto fill our sails. \"And what were my movements?\" To stick to my rooms\r\nright handy for anything. Was there a sinister thought, I wonder, behind\r\nthe \"Good, I agree with you,\" that came back from him in his heartiest\r\ntones? \"I will look after things down-town and we can keep each other\r\nposted at near intervals.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as busy a forenoon as man ever lived through. My Boston wire kept\r\nup a constant ringing; Chicago, Philadelphia, and other long distance\r\npoints showered in messages. A direct wire to Wall Street informed me of\r\nthe progress of events in the financial maelstrom. All went merrily and\r\nwell. It was nearing noon when a lull came; I was sitting back in my\r\nchair enjoying the sudden cessation of clatter and buzzing, thinking\r\nthat after all my forebodings our ship was headed right for harbor and\r\nin a few moments would be across the bar and into smooth water, when a\r\nsharp ring at the telephone summoned me back to attention. 'Twas from 26\r\nBroadway, from whom it doesn't matter for the purpose of this story.\r\nSuffice it to say that it was from one who, because of past acts of\r\nmine, would make any sacrifice to warn me of danger. Only a few words,\r\nfor he who sends secret messages from the mysterious depths of 26\r\nBroadway, even to dwellers on its threshold, is wise in remembering that\r\nbrevity is the essence of safety--but were few words ever charged with\r\nsuch damnable import? This is what I heard:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stillman has just left Mr. Rogers and there is deviltry afoot. You\r\ncannot get to him any too quick.\" \"One word of its nature?\" I whispered\r\nback. \"They are going to grab more than five millions of the\r\nsubscription money.\"\r\n\r\nI hung up the receiver. The face of my world had changed. To choke back\r\nthe passion of fury that rose in my throat I went over to the open\r\nwindow and looked out at the brilliant world below, at the procession of\r\npleasure carriages rolling up and down the Avenue, the sunlight flashing\r\nfrom gold-mounted harness and shining on the sleek, polished flanks of\r\nsplendid horses. A gay rumble of traffic, the murmur of voices, the\r\nclangor of street-car bells were borne in to me on the mellow air. But\r\nfor me the light had fled and the May world was black and freezing cold.\r\n\r\nThe grim agony of that moment's silence I shall never forget. I jumped\r\nfor the door; a second's delay to tell my secretary to catch me with any\r\nimportant messages at Mr. Rogers' office, and I was flying down Fifth\r\nAvenue through Washington Square, and down the back streets my cabby\r\nknew so well how to make time on. When the recording angel calls off\r\npage after page of my life-book and comes to the black one covering that\r\nride, I fear 'twill be no easy task excusing the murderous passion that\r\nfilled my heart and the poison-steeped curses my lips involuntarily\r\nformed. After an eternity I was at 26 Broadway. I flew to the elevator,\r\nwas on the eleventh floor in an instant, bolted by Fred, the colored\r\nusher who guards Mr. Rogers' sanctum, and strode, without knock or\r\nannouncement, into the large private office beyond. Mr. Rogers was alone\r\nwith his secretary, who at my first words shot out of the room. He was\r\nbending over a stack of papers, and as I landed at his desk he looked up\r\nquickly, and in a surprised way asked:\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean, Lawson?\"\r\n\r\nNo one ever enters Mr. Rogers' room without his permission.\r\n\r\n\"It means that I have just learned that you and Stillman have decided to\r\nbreak your solemn promise to me.\" I tried to control myself, but the\r\nseethe of rage almost choked me. \"It means that you have decided to take\r\nmore of that subscription money than the five millions we agreed upon,\r\nand that means hell.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers stood up, his jaws set as in their last hold, and,\r\nrecognizing the crisis, he met me, not with the fierce anger I half\r\nexpected and hoped he would show, but with quiet earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Stop just there, Lawson--remember you are in my office. Who gave you\r\nthis tale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. Is it true? Are you going to break your promise to me? Do\r\nyou intend to allot the public more than five millions?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated only a second. Just a second, but it seemed an age; then\r\nslowly and calmly: \"Yes, it has been decided that considering the\r\ntremendous number and amounts of the subscription it will be best to\r\ngive them more.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much more?\" I shouted, for I was beside myself.\r\n\r\n\"Ten millions in all,\" he slowly answered.\r\n\r\n\"Who has decided?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one, Mr. Rockefeller, Stillman, all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of us? Have _I_ been consulted? Have _I_ decided? Have _I_\r\nconsented to the breaking of your word, Mr. Rockefeller's word? What\r\nhave Stillman and the rest to say about this? What have they to do with\r\nthe promises I have made the people? I have been trapped just as all the\r\nothers you and I have dealt with have been trapped. I see it all now.\r\nTrapped, trapped until now it is too late for me even to save my\r\nreputation. To think I should have been fool enough to allow myself to\r\nbe made a stool-pigeon for 'Standard Oil,' and all because I took your\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\nMy rage was exhausted, and then, heartbroken, I turned and plead, plead\r\nfor fair treatment, for an honest deal for my friends and\r\nassociates--plead for my good name in his keeping--plead as I never\r\nbefore plead to any man. I had lost control of myself--begged as no man\r\nshould beg another even for life, though the things I sought were more\r\nthan life. He calmly awaited the end of my feverish, broken petition;\r\nthen he went to work as the expert diamond cutter goes at a crystal. He\r\nfocussed my position, twisted and turned my arguments, chipped and split\r\nmy reasoning, smoothed off the corners, and then polished up the subject\r\nso that it might retain its old-time lustre for the bedazzlement of the\r\ncustomer whose favorable decision he meant to have.\r\n\r\nAs ever, Mr. Rogers' arguments were plausible and intelligent. The\r\nsubscriptions were coming in at such a rate it would be dangerous to\r\nallot as little as five millions; there might be talk, and an\r\ninvestigation which would so affect the market later that we could have\r\nno second section. Then where should we be with our millions of Butte,\r\nMontana, and other Boston stocks? And where would our friends be--and\r\nthe public? On and on he spun, lulling my fagged brain with his specious\r\narguments until the change of plan seemed robbed of its poison and I\r\nswallowed it.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he concluded, \"every dollar of the additional five millions\r\nwill be kept intact and, with the first five millions, will be at all\r\ntimes behind the price, and as you are going to have the handling of it\r\nhow can there be any wrong or any more danger because of it than if it\r\nwere only five millions?\"\r\n\r\nI gave in, agreed to go back to the Waldorf and take hold of the lever\r\nagain. I left him, driving uptown by way of Broad and Wall streets so I\r\nmight see the crowds outside the Stock Exchange and in front of James\r\nStillman's money trap. By the time I reached the hotel I had recovered\r\nsome of my optimism, and went to work to catch up with the mail and\r\nmessages accumulated in my absence. At three o'clock I called up Mr.\r\nRogers. He was very jubilant. At the stroke of twelve, he told me, it\r\nrequired four big policemen to close the bank doors in the faces of\r\nhundreds of belated subscribers; that it had been decided that those\r\ninside the building were legally entitled to pass in their subscriptions\r\nand at that moment they were still doing so. Sacks of mail still awaited\r\nopening; it would be well toward midnight before the last of the\r\nsubscriptions were tabulated. Stillman was making a tremendous effort to\r\nget at an approximate statement in time for me to deal it out to the\r\nnewspapers before they went to press at midnight.\r\n\r\n\"How does it look to Stillman now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He cannot tell much about it yet,\" Mr. Rogers replied, \"although he can\r\nsee far enough ahead to be sure even your estimate was too low. It will\r\nbe at least fifty millions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And about our big subscription--have you and Mr. Rockefeller put it in\r\nyet?\" I asked, and how I strained for his answer! I well knew they had\r\nnot done so, knew they would think it safe to wait until the final tally\r\nto see just how much they must put in to get their $65,000,000, which\r\nwould thus leave the public $10,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he returned. \"It's all right, but we can do nothing till\r\nStillman gives us the total. He says there are millions and millions of\r\nsuch a nature that he can easily throw them out. At four o'clock we will\r\nhave a meeting and figure out the best way to fix this matter up.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw no danger spot. I felt anyway his error was beyond correction\r\nnow. I told him I would be at his office by five, so that we could\r\narrange how much the press should have of our affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK FLAG HOISTED\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a little after five when I reached 26 Broadway--my second visit\r\nthat day. Mr. Rogers was still at the bank. Half an hour later he\r\nentered and threw himself wearily into a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, this is a fitting climax for all the stories you have been\r\ntelling Mr. Rockefeller and myself and the public for the past year\r\nabout 'Coppers.' I have talked with the Lewisohns, Governor Flower,\r\nMorgan, and many others, and I have just come from an hour with Stillman\r\nand we are all agreed this Amalgamated subscription is the greatest\r\naccomplishment in finance. It is truly marvellous. The bank is literally\r\nburied in money, and as near as we can make it out, the stock to be\r\ndelivered when allotted is actually selling at forty to fifty dollars\r\nover the subscription price. The job is done, and you and I have good\r\nreason to congratulate each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure, Mr. Rogers, that we should, right now. There's lots\r\nof work ahead, and we may strike big snags yet,\" I began. He interrupted\r\nimpatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you're wrong, Lawson! We have the money safely housed at the\r\nbank. Nothing can now turn it into failure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a new note in his voice as he spoke. Tired though he was, I\r\ndetected a sharpness that seemed to indicate at once a relief and an\r\nindifference which said plainer than words: \"I am now beyond all your\r\npower to hurt or harm me.\" I went on:\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to bring up any new things to-day, for you must be tired\r\nout, Mr. Rogers, but surely you are taking into consideration that\r\nunless everything is steered carefully to-morrow and for some time to\r\ncome, we may have a crash in the market which will throw back on our\r\nhands the ten millions of stock, and it might take us years to bring out\r\nthe other section. Don't lose sight of the fact that the people are all\r\nexpecting to see fifty or one hundred points profit to-morrow on\r\nwhatever stock they secure.\"\r\n\r\nAs I talked I saw that he was getting impatient, irritated, angry, that\r\nhe wanted to hear of no more unfavorable things.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, Lawson, it is about time for you to let up on your croaking\r\nabout what may happen. You have done a big thing and you have been paid\r\nhandsomely; you have made millions, and we have just now decided that\r\nyou are entitled to a good rest. Governor Flower has agreed to take\r\ncharge of the market end and he is amply able to keep us out of all\r\ntrouble in that direction.\"\r\n\r\nA cold chill struck into my heart and crept over my whole being. I\r\nlooked straight at him and he gave me back the look with a defiance\r\nwhich plainly said that we might as well have it out now as any other\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rockefeller and myself have tried to play fair with you, Lawson,\r\nand we think we have been generous, but at times you have been almost\r\nintolerable. The only way you know how to do things is to do them your\r\nown way, and we cannot do business except in our way. This morning you\r\nkicked up a disturbance because we decided to adjust ourselves to\r\nconditions as they arose. I did tell you five millions would be all we\r\nwould sell, but when we agreed to that we had no idea the subscription\r\nwould be so large. Since then we have got far enough to see that the\r\nsubscription will run even beyond fifty millions, and you may as well\r\nhear now that in consequence it has been decided by every one interested\r\nwith the exception of yourself to raise it still another five millions,\r\nthat is, fifteen millions instead of ten, and I don't want to go through\r\nany more scenes about broken promises and what the people will think,\r\neither. The people have gone into this thing with their eyes wide open;\r\nwe are giving them good value; you are in no way their guardian, and you\r\nare not going to run this affair any more than others who are\r\ninterested. You may as well make up your mind to it right now.\"\r\n\r\nHe let himself go as he talked, breathing fire and defiance, but I cared\r\nnothing for all the terrors of his anger. A blind fury seized me--I\r\ndon't believe there was ever such a scene before at 26 Broadway, and I\r\nthink it has had but one parallel since, when Mr. Rogers and myself\r\nagain had it out over another matter. This time there were no pleas or\r\npetitions. I denounced, demanded, threatened. He had straight and strong\r\nmy version of the vampire history of \"Standard Oil,\" and also in rough,\r\ncrude terms my opinion of his trickery and double-dealing. My voice was\r\nraised. I had lost all thought of what his people in the outer office\r\nwould think. As I went on he wilted and tried to stop me, for I had\r\nshown him, until he knew it was so, that nothing but my death before I\r\nleft the building would prevent me from taking the whole miserable\r\naffair, first to the newspapers, and then to the courts. I proved to him\r\nthat I would have injunctions against Stillman, the National City Bank,\r\nand every one in interest, before the allotment could be made. Gradually\r\nhis rage subsided and he broke down--not as other men break down, but as\r\nmuch as it is possible for his stern nature to give way. We remained\r\nthere until seven o'clock. The building was as still as a set\r\nmouse-trap, and he strove with me. Such action, he demonstrated, would\r\nprecipitate a panic. His argument was perfect in its logic.\r\n\r\n\"Not one man in a million, Lawson, will agree with you that you are\r\njustified in bringing about all this disaster simply because you think\r\nthat we are taking too much of the cash that has been voluntarily paid\r\nin by people well able to attend to their own affairs. You must remember\r\nonce this scandal and trouble are public they never can be smothered.\r\nThere can be no more consolidation, no more copper boom in your lifetime\r\nand mine, and when the collapse comes every one will look for the\r\nvictim, and that victim will be you. Even your best friend will say if\r\nyou were going to turn informer you should have been smart enough to\r\nhave discovered your mare's nest before you let it grow so big. Look at\r\nit, Lawson, look at it, and in the name of everything that is reasonable\r\nget back your senses.\"\r\n\r\nMy readers must remember that the Henry H. Rogers I am portraying here\r\nis no ordinary man, but the strongest, most acute, and most persuasive\r\nhuman being that in the thirty-five active years of my life I have\r\nencountered. And on me all the magic of his wonderful individuality, all\r\nthe resources of his fertile mind, all the histrionic power of his\r\ndramatic personality were concentrated. His logic was resistless. As he\r\nspun the web of his argument my position seemed hopeless; even more\r\nforcible than his reasoning was the graphic recital of how both\r\nincreases had been made. His eyes watered as he spoke. They were not his\r\nproposals, but Stillman's and the others' who had been let in on the\r\nseveral floors, but to whom he had never explained my rights nor my\r\nposition in the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, Lawson,\" he said--\"and I'll not mince matters further:\r\nFrom the beginning I have done business with you on a basis entirely\r\ndifferent from that on which it is our rule to deal with agents or\r\nassociates. At the start I expected that you would, as all others have\r\ndone, fall into our ways. Instead, you have grown more stubborn, and the\r\nresult is, I have been forced into all kinds of holes, some of which I\r\nhave not even let William Rockefeller know about. Here at last I am in\r\nbetween the grinders. I cannot go to such men as Stillman and Morgan and\r\nadmit that you are the one who has been doing this copper business that\r\nI have had them think I was doing myself. You would not ask me to put\r\nmyself in such a humiliating position. Think what John D. Rockefeller\r\nwould say of such a confession. It's impossible. And when these\r\nassociates of mine get down to this matter and all agree upon the way it\r\nshould be closed up, what can I do but go with them? If they knew the\r\nfacts it would be easy to run you in between us, and then you would\r\neither have to convince them or give way yourself, but this is not\r\npossible here.\"\r\n\r\nThe straight and narrow way is easy to follow, but once lost is hard to\r\nfind. The defaulting bank president who overnight \"borrows\" a few\r\nthousands from his institution, fully intends to return the \"loan\" next\r\nday, but repairing an error is even more difficult than resisting a\r\ntemptation, and when a man is in crime's net, his struggles to escape\r\nseem only to tighten around him its meshes. When the incidents of his\r\ndownfall are before the jury or the coroner, there will always appear a\r\ndozen places where the unfortunate might have cut his way out of the\r\nstrangling coils, but he who surveys such situations from the outside\r\nhas a clearer vision than the blinded and desperate wretch in the trap.\r\nHe who enlists with the brigands of \"frenzied finance\" and takes the\r\noath of addition, division, and silence cannot discharge himself because\r\nhis comrades are needlessly harsh to their victims. Eventually he may\r\ndecide on desertion as preferable to throat-cutting, but to suggest\r\nresignation is to invite destruction, for it is a tradition of the\r\nfraternity that the best cure for repentance is a knife-thrust.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers and myself wrestled with the situation until both were fairly\r\nexhausted. Finally we went uptown together; he home, to return later to\r\nthe bank, I to the Waldorf to meet the newspaper men who were there\r\nawaiting the news of the subscription. I left him at Thirty-third\r\nStreet, the question between us still unsolved. In the years that have\r\npassed since that ill-starred night, over and over again I have sifted\r\nand pounded the talk that then passed between us, and never have I been\r\nable to decide how much of what Mr. Rogers said to me was true and how\r\nmuch cunning argument to make me accede to his wishes. I hope none of my\r\nreaders will ever find themselves so caught between the high cliffs and\r\nthe deep water as I was that night. I recalled the old story of the\r\nsea-captain whose ship was captured by pirates and who was offered the\r\nalternative of hoisting the black flag and joining the band with his\r\ncrew, or walking the plank. If he became a pirate, at least he saved the\r\nlives of his men, for their fate hung on his decision. If he\r\nrefused--well, he retained his own virtue and kept intact that of his\r\ncrew. The captain in my story had preferred propriety to piracy, and\r\nfifteen men lost their lives to no purpose, whereas the part of wisdom\r\nwould have been to submit, with reservations, on the chance of throwing\r\nthe pirates to the sharks at the first opportunity. If I should throw\r\nthe bomb that I had threatened Rogers with, I felt sure it would put an\r\nend to all his evil machinations, but I could not limit the area of\r\ndestruction to the guilty. I let my mind dwell on Mr. Rogers' words:\r\n\"Lawson, no harm can come to your people, for the fifteen millions will\r\nbe used in the market to protect the stock, just as I promised you.\" If\r\nthis promise were kept, what was there to fear? But would it be kept? In\r\nthe face of the evidence of broken pledges already crowded on me, and\r\nthe bitter knowledge I had acquired of the wolfish greed of this man and\r\nhis associates, it would be paltering with facts to say that even then I\r\nfelt certain the money would be so used. Yet \"Standard Oil\" avoids such\r\ndirect illegality as might bring it within the law's clutches, and I\r\nknew that already a fraud had been committed. I might hold that over\r\nthem and compel them to go straight. Then I recalled the passion that\r\npossessed them to grab at real money when it came within their clutches,\r\nand the \"Governor Flower to handle the market in such a way that no harm\r\ncan come to us.\"\r\n\r\nI carried my heart-tearing perplexities to dinner, cogitated over the\r\narguments pro and con, and finally made up my mind that the percentage\r\nof wisdom was in favor of sticking by the ship. On board I was in better\r\nshape to protect my friends and followers than if I jumped into the\r\nocean. Time has shown since that it would have been far better for all\r\nconcerned for me to have touched off the powder magazine that night, had\r\none grand and glorious explosion, and gone down with the wreckage, than\r\nto have sailed through the hell of after years. I am not the first man\r\nwho has balked at amputation and got blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BOGUS SUBSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, on his way downtown, Mr. Rogers came to my rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready for the finals, Lawson?\" he said cordially. He, too, had\r\ndined, and doubtless philosophized; his whole air showed me he had\r\nsatisfied himself that I would submit to the logic of conditions. No man\r\nknows the human animal from his heart's seed to its bloom better than\r\nHenry H. Rogers--and I was human.\r\n\r\nI told him I would hold the reporters until I got the word from him, and\r\nthat it must not be later than midnight. No questions were asked nor\r\nassurances given. He left in a moment for the National City Bank, and\r\nthere in its solemn chambers he and James Stillman perpetrated the act\r\nwhich is the crime of Amalgamated, in itself a stark and palpable fraud,\r\nbut aggravated by the standing of the men concerned in it, and the\r\npledges that were slaughtered, into as arrant and damnable piece of\r\nfinancial villany as was ever committed.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o'clock my telephone rang. I heard Mr. Rogers' voice.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, Stillman's tally is so far completed that we know about where\r\nwe are. Give out to the press that the subscription runs between four\r\nhundred and four hundred and twenty-five millions, call it four hundred\r\nand twelve millions, after throwing out one hundred and seventy millions\r\nfrom speculators, and sixty-two millions as defective, and after\r\nshutting out fifty millions more which were received too late. Each\r\nsubscriber will be allotted fifteen to twenty per cent. of his\r\nsubscription--call it eighteen per cent.\"\r\n\r\nThe figures were paralyzing. I made no attempt to analyze them. They\r\ncame so late that as soon as the newspaper-men with me got them they\r\nflew to their offices and thus I escaped a strenuous ordeal of\r\ninterviewing. Our arrangements for distributing the facts throughout the\r\ncountry were made through the _Boston Financial News_, to which we had\r\ngiven the exclusive right to send out the details, and its special wires\r\nwere soon clicking the news to all the world. The next morning the press\r\ncontained the particulars. I reproduce from the papers of May 5th the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     =$412,000,000 FOR AMALGAMATED COPPERS=\r\n\r\n     =$75,000,000 Subscribed More Than Five Times Over=\r\n\r\n     =FINANCIAL WORLD COPPER MAD=\r\n\r\n     Subscriptions of $412,000,000--the largest in any financial\r\n     deal in the world's history--are reported by the _Boston\r\n     Financial News_ to have been received toward the Amalgamated\r\n     Company. \"The world has gone copper mad\" in truth.\r\n\r\n     Subscribers can be allotted only eighteen one-hundredths, or\r\n     less than one share in five of the amount applied for.\r\n\r\n     One week ago, says the report, it was announced that the\r\n     Standard Oil magnates, Rogers, Rockefeller, and their\r\n     associates, had begun their conquering march upon\r\n     copperdom--that the much heralded copper consolidation was a\r\n     thing of fact--that the Amalgamated Company had been\r\n     incorporated, and that its first capital, $75,000,000, would\r\n     be offered to the public by subscription through the\r\n     National City Bank of New York at $100 per share--$100 per\r\n     share, without a discount, a commission, or profit to any\r\n     one.\r\n\r\n     Never before since the first dollar of civilization was\r\n     invented to take the place of the stone tokens of barbarism\r\n     had such a thing been heard of--$75,000,000 of stock to be\r\n     sold to investors at $100 per share, and in one week after\r\n     the birth of the corporation upon which it was based.\r\n\r\n     The financial world held its breath, and from that time up\r\n     to the closing of the books of subscription, at twelve\r\n     o'clock noon yesterday, the financial world, English,\r\n     German, and French, have awaited with bated breath the\r\n     outcome of this great feat of modern financiering.\r\n\r\n     During the entire week from all parts of the world have\r\n     poured into the National City Bank applications, accompanied\r\n     by checks for the first payment--one continuous stream of\r\n     entreaties--for some of the shares of this great enterprise.\r\n     Nothing in history tells of such a movement.\r\n\r\n     Early in the week it became evident to the managers of the\r\n     great industrial revolution that something must be done to\r\n     stop the movement or it would run to such an extent as to\r\n     cause serious trouble in the money markets of the world.\r\n     Since Monday most strenuous efforts have been made to\r\n     discourage the taking of large subscriptions. To that end\r\n     the powerful financiers interested have begged all who\r\n     contemplated subscribing for over $1,000,000 to keep their\r\n     applications down to that figure, and their efforts met with\r\n     complete success.\r\n\r\n     Again, all those who were connected with the enterprise and\r\n     who had intended subscribing on the same basis as outsiders\r\n     for very large amounts, agreed that if the subscription ran\r\n     over $150,000,000 they would refrain from subscribing that\r\n     those who had subscribed would not become dissatisfied with\r\n     the smallness of their allotment. Still the rush continued.\r\n     From all financial centres of the world came the unbroken\r\n     chain of applications, until those most interested in the\r\n     success of the undertaking were appalled at the magnitude of\r\n     the interest aroused.\r\n\r\n     For the past forty-eight hours the National City Bank has\r\n     had employed, night and day, a corps of forty-odd extra\r\n     clerks calculating and arranging the applications and\r\n     checks. At exactly twelve o'clock noon four uniformed\r\n     watchmen closed the doors of the subscription department of\r\n     the City Bank in the face of over three hundred intending\r\n     subscribers, who were frantic at their vain efforts to get\r\n     in their subscriptions before the appointed hour arrived.\r\n\r\n     Up to eleven o'clock to-night the entire bank force, regular\r\n     and extra, have been at work, and at this hour the figures\r\n     were announced which make the subscription of the\r\n     Amalgamated Copper the greatest event in finance since the\r\n     world began.\r\n\r\n     After throwing out bids that were, on examination, proved to\r\n     be the efforts of speculators to take advantage of the great\r\n     interest to make money with no risk, and after throwing out\r\n     bids unaccompanied by checks, or checks that were not\r\n     satisfactory, the first class amounting to over\r\n     $170,000,000, and the last to over $62,000,000, the total\r\n     cash subscription was found to have reached the gigantic sum\r\n     of $412,000,000, which gave to each and every subscriber\r\n     eighteen per cent. of his subscription.\r\n\r\n     It is not known how much was represented in the 300\r\n     subscribers who were too late, but it is estimated at\r\n     $50,000,000--five of the 300 had single subscriptions of\r\n     $1,000,000 each. It is estimated that the sum total of the\r\n     subscriptions that were thrown out or that arrived by\r\n     messenger or mail--for the mail is still pouring into the\r\n     bank--was between $300,000,000 and $400,000,000, which,\r\n     added to what insiders had intended to secure for\r\n     themselves, would have carried the total to over\r\n     $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n     It is estimated also that there are a great many who,\r\n     anticipating the enormous over-subscriptions, have refrained\r\n     from subscribing and will purchase in the open market.\r\n\r\n     Immediately after the subscription closed, 140, or forty per\r\n     cent. premium, was bid for the stock secured by the lucky\r\n     bidders.\r\n\r\n     It is said the company will issue the next $100,000,000 at\r\n     once, as those insiders who refrained from subscribing were\r\n     practically promised that they would at once be given an\r\n     equal opportunity to subscribe if they would hold back on\r\n     this issue. It is apparent that the next subscription will\r\n     be even greater and cause more excitement than the first\r\n     one, particularly as it is agreed by all that the price of\r\n     the stock will quickly mount to $200 per share, as it is to\r\n     be put upon the English, German, French, New York, and\r\n     Boston Stock Exchanges, and will undoubtedly become one of\r\n     the greatest investments sought for by the wealthy classes.\r\n\r\n     England sent in subscriptions for $50,000,000; Germany and\r\n     France, $20,000,000 each; Boston and New England showed\r\n     their steadfast faith in copper by subscribing for over\r\n     $200,000,000.\r\n\r\n     There is great excitement at the clubs and meeting-places of\r\n     investors and brokers to-night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is what Mr. Rogers and Mr. Stillman did. After discarding all\r\nunsatisfactory and imperfect subscriptions, there remained subscriptions\r\nof between $125,000,000 and $150,000,000 which had complied with all\r\nlegal conditions, and accompanying these were checks aggregating between\r\n$6,250,000 and $7,500,000. This was real money, in the bank and within\r\nreach, and the two great financiers, hungering for every dollar of it,\r\ndetermined to possess themselves of this great sum and use it as surety\r\nto compel the payment of the balance. First, they agreed that not a\r\ndollar of the five per cent. subscription should be returned; next, to\r\nso use this amount that no one to whom stock was allotted would back\r\nout, but, on the contrary, promptly take his whole allotment and pay up\r\nthe balance. To effect this they decided to allot each subscriber just\r\nthe number of shares of Amalgamated necessary to render the amount of\r\nmoney accompanying his subscription equal to about a twenty-five or\r\nthirty per cent. payment on his whole allotment. This would constitute\r\nsuch a large margin as to assure the payment of the other seventy or\r\nseventy-five per cent. due. For instance, a man who applied for a\r\nhundred shares accompanied his subscription with a check for $500. He\r\nwas allotted twenty shares, value $2,000, on which his $500 check\r\nrepresented a payment of twenty-five per cent. If the conditions of the\r\nNational City Bank's advertisement had been complied with, he was\r\nabsolutely entitled to three shares of every five subscribed for, or\r\nsixty in all. To bring about the proportion which Mr. Rogers wanted, a\r\nbogus subscription of five or six times the unallotted balance was put\r\nin by him, and this is where the fraud was committed. The National City\r\nBank was in duty bound to protect the public from any such bogus\r\nsubscription, and to see that fair treatment was accorded to all\r\nsubscribers. Yet, unfaithful to the trust, it permitted this bogus\r\nsubscription to be put in, many hours after the bids had been opened. It\r\nutterly failed to comply with the conditions of its advertisement, and\r\nwas thus a direct party to the fraud perpetrated by its president and\r\nMr. Rogers. The exact amount of the bogus subscription could not be\r\ndecided until the exact figures of the subscriptions had been compiled,\r\nso the figures I gave out that night were only estimates. Within the\r\nnext few days it was ascertained that the genuine subscriptions totalled\r\n$132,067,500, upon which an allotment of one share in five, or\r\n$26,413,500 of stock altogether, was made to the public.\r\n\r\nIn this way the conspirators secured from the public $26,413,500 of the\r\noriginal cost, $39,000,000, and yet retained over $48,500,000 of the\r\nauthorized stock of $75,000,000. In other words the public paid\r\ntwo-thirds of the purchase price, and the conspirators retained nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the property.\r\n\r\nThe fraud thus perpetrated amounts to this: Every subscriber legally\r\nentitled to three shares of Amalgamated stock was deprived of two of\r\nthem by the National City Bank, and the proof is to be found in the\r\nbooks of said National City Bank. My readers may say here that this\r\nconstitutes a fortunate condition rather than a crime to be punished,\r\nfor the less Amalgamated a man had, the better he was off, as the stock\r\nafterward declined. This conclusion is a false one, however.\r\n\r\nHere, in simple terms, is an illustration of what was done in\r\nAmalgamated and of what the wrong was.\r\n\r\nB had a valuable race-horse and decided to dispose of him in five\r\nshares. He offered these five shares for public subscription and\r\nadvertised that if over five were subscribed for he would split up the\r\nshares and allot them pro rata. There were on the final day seven\r\nsubscriptions. Instead of turning over the horse to the seven\r\nsubscribers to own and race in their own way, B notified them that\r\ntwenty-one subscriptions had been received, and that for their seven he\r\nhad allotted them a one-third ownership, while the other subscribers\r\nwould retain two-thirds. In the two-thirds resided the right to manage\r\nand race the horse, and the seven had no say whatever in this direction.\r\nThe seven honest subscribers, not suspecting that B had simply sold them\r\none-third of his horse for nearly his whole cost, and that he still\r\nretained a two-thirds ownership in him, supposed that fourteen others\r\nhad subscribed on the same terms as themselves. If the horse were really\r\nable to race and thereby earn large sums of money, it was by this fraud\r\nin B's power to make him appear so worthless that the seven bona-fide\r\nsubscribers would be inclined to turn over their ownerships to B at his\r\nown figure. Contrariwise, B could so dose the horse as to make him\r\nappear more valuable than he really was, and use the advantage to\r\ndispose of his fourteen shares for fictitiously high prices.\r\n\r\nThe world assumes an attitude of horror and amazement at the mention of\r\ncrime, and thousands of words are written to describe what led up to and\r\naway from any given overt deed; but the deed itself, however grave,\r\nshameful, or portentous, seems strangely barren and bloodless set down\r\nin naked words. Yet the mountain peak that tops the great ranges is but\r\na shoulder over its neighbor, though it may be the apex of a continent.\r\nA misconstrued word has caused the spilling of the blood of millions;\r\nthe needle-point of a stiletto has severed kingdoms. Between temptation\r\nand consequence there is but little space, yet it is deep and wide\r\nenough for all the poison in the tongues of all the world's serpents.\r\nTo-day, a simple peasant, humble, gentle, is an insignificant atom in\r\nthe great Russian Empire, and Nicholas is the supreme ruler of rulers.\r\nTo-morrow, by a simple swing of an arm a bomb is thrown, and the peasant\r\nis the one human being in all the world; the face of Russia is changed,\r\nand Nicholas--is not.\r\n\r\nThe first crime of Amalgamated is a matter of mathematics. It involved\r\nplain fraud and misrepresentation, the insertion of a bogus subscription\r\nand the disruption of solemn pledges, but the commission of it was\r\nnothing more than a matter of arrangement between two men, one the\r\nmaster of the greatest of all business organizations, and the other the\r\nhead of the strongest bank in the United States. The consequences were\r\nworld-wide. That night no bomb was thrown, but a seed was sown for the\r\ncruelest harvest of crime, dishonor, unhappiness, and desolation ever\r\nreaped within the confines of our republic.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The above statement has now been in the hands of the\r\n     public, has been printed and commented on in thousands of\r\n     the leading journals of the world for twelve months, and no\r\n     Government official has taken cognizance of it. The charges\r\n     I make constitute one of the gravest business crimes ever\r\n     committed by any national bank. If they are true, the\r\n     Government at Washington has no more important duty than to\r\n     punish the criminals. If they are false, I should be sent to\r\n     prison. What a commentary on our boasted freedom and\r\n     equality! The National City Bank does business at the old\r\n     stand. Rogers, Rockefeller and Stillman walk the streets; so\r\n     do I, and since I published the above statement and\r\n     submitted the above proof, at least half a dozen poor\r\n     national bank clerks and officials who have stolen a few\r\n     hundreds or thousands have been sent to prison, or have\r\n     committed suicide to avoid being sent there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERMATH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just past the midnight of May 4th. The last newspaper-man had\r\ntaken his departure, my friends had all retired, and I was alone for the\r\nfirst moment since the news had come from the City Bank. I had not then\r\nstopped to analyze its character, for there had been only time to\r\nannounce it. Now, however, I sat down at my desk and with a pencil and a\r\npiece of paper began to cipher out what the \"412 millions\" meant. As I\r\nfigured, cold sweat began to gather on my forehead, and the further I\r\nfigured the colder the sweat, until at last in an agony of perplexity I\r\nagain called up Mr. Rogers. My agitation must have betrayed itself in my\r\nvoice, though I tried to assume a tone of calm inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers,\" I said, \"I've been vainly trying to figure out the meaning\r\nof the subscription figures you gave me and I cannot make head or tail\r\nof them. You said '400 to 425 millions'; of course that means you have\r\nput in our dummy subscription, but what was the real subscription? It is\r\nabsolutely essential that I know to-night, for in the morning I shall be\r\nbesieged for information, and ignorance on my part may get all hands\r\ninto trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he replied, \"you must not talk such things over the wire--you\r\ndon't know who is listening. You must not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" I replied determinedly. \"I positively must have the\r\nreal figures, for even you and Mr. Stillman may have made a slip-up and\r\nI want to work the thing out so that I may have it clear in my head for\r\nthe morning. It is essential.\"\r\n\r\nHe realized that it was useless to try to escape my insistence, and he\r\nsnapped out:\r\n\r\n\"All I can say now is, it is between 125 and 150 millions real, solid\r\nsubscriptions, backed with actual money. We haven't got it figured out\r\nwithin some millions, and won't before to-morrow, when we will put in\r\nour subscription for the right amount, but we know it is surely between\r\nthese two figures, and that each subscriber will have about one share in\r\nfive, so we shall have a good, strong twenty-five per cent. margin. That\r\nis all I will or can say to-night.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the sharp click as he hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\nI went back to my pencil and pad and began again the interminable\r\nfiguring. My head throbbed and my senses reeled. In those still, dark\r\nhours of the early morning I covered sheet after sheet with figures, all\r\nof which had for a basis 125 to 150 millions, 400 to 425 millions, one\r\nin five, and twenty-five per cent. margin, and these figures I turned\r\nand twisted in a vain, vain effort to bring out something with fifteen\r\nmillions for an answer.\r\n\r\n\"No, it will not come,\" I said to myself at last in hopeless despair.\r\n\r\nNumb and dull, I leaned back in my chair with half-closed eyes, while\r\nnight, that master phantom maker, played upon my harried nerves and\r\ndistraught mind. Stealthily out of his murky caldron the ghosts and\r\ngoblins crept. I saw the spectres of all my dearest dreams trail\r\nslouching by, jostled and driven by sneering bullies. I saw a great\r\ncompany of scowling men, wailing women, and little children, with drawn,\r\npinched faces, and they seemed to point at me as they plodded past,\r\nmuttering, \"But for you.\" Then, to the clanking of chains, hoarse\r\ncurses, and the sharp whip-snap, lines upon lines of men in striped\r\nsuits, with cropped heads, and faces branded by despair, filed up.\r\nFaintly a mutter of sobs and groans echoed, \"But for you.\" The clanking\r\nceased; there came the slow shuffling of many feet, and a procession of\r\nmen, bearing stretchers on which lay shrouded figures, advanced into\r\nview. Like a solemn knell upon my ear smote the reproach, \"Suicides\r\nbecause of you.\" And now out of the caldron sprang a mob of goblin\r\ndollar-signs compounded of blood-red snakes and copper bars, that\r\ndanced a mad saraband around my chair to a weird chorus of, \"But for\r\nyou.\" Transfixed and aghast I stared at the train of awful forms. So\r\nreal were they, they seemed almost to touch me as they swept onward. At\r\nlast, with a convulsive effort, I threw off the spell, banished the\r\nphantasms of my frightened brain, and shook myself together with a: \"You\r\nhave work ahead and dreaming will not do it for you.\"\r\n\r\nBack into my mind trooped the unanswerable, cold realities. There could\r\nbe no doubt that the announcements in the morning papers would surprise\r\nthose who had been led to expect an allotment of one share in twenty or\r\nthirty and had subscribed accordingly, and likewise those who had\r\nexpected to get all, or at least one out of two. There might be murmurs\r\nof foul play and a general suspicion that trickery had been practised.\r\nLooking at the situation, I saw that upon me the chief blame must fall,\r\nand that it behooved me to think soundly and quickly over what had best\r\nbe done to protect from the impending massacre those whom I had lured\r\ninto the ambush. The smoke-wreaths had all gone out of my brain now, and\r\nas the known factors began to group themselves symmetrically before my\r\nmind I forced myself to face certain all-too-evident facts: Rogers and\r\nStillman had plainly hoisted the black flag; they had broken all their\r\npromises to me and assuredly had no intention of carrying out to the\r\npublic the pledges I had made on their behalf; they would handle this\r\naffair as they had others I knew about--only to extract the greatest\r\nnumber of dollars from it--and in the course of their operations I and\r\nmy friends would probably be sent through the crusher with the rest. All\r\nthis being true, I could do little by denunciation or exposure, for\r\nthese men, caring nothing for the sufferings of others, would not fear\r\nthe consequences of their own acts; my only hope was to meet them on\r\ntheir own ground and outplay them at their own game. Then and there I\r\ndetermined on my course--to compel them to undo the wrongs they had\r\ncommitted and, if so great an achievement were possible, put the people\r\nin position to do to them what they had done to the people. An almost\r\nhopeless resolution at that juncture, it would seem, but, as results\r\nhave shown, by no means out of the power of man's accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThis is what I reasoned out before I retired to bed: If the actual\r\nsubscription were 125 to 150 millions, then six to eight millions of\r\nreal cash had been paid into the National City Bank. On an allotment of\r\none share in five, these six to eight millions represented a margin of\r\nabout twenty-five per cent.--big enough to cover any ordinary drop in\r\nthe price of the stock, and big enough also to lead those to whom shares\r\nhad been assigned to make good the balance. But to meet this allotment,\r\na very large bogus subscription had been necessary, and therein I saw\r\nthe weakness of Rogers and Rockefeller and the weapon that Providence\r\nhad intrusted to my hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers' uncertainty as to the totals of the subscription made it\r\nevident that the bogus subscription was not in the bank even yet, and as\r\nit must be for a definite amount and backed up by a five-per-cent.\r\ncheck, it could not be put in until James Stillman's clerks had computed\r\nto the last cent the public's applications, and that enormous piece of\r\nwork would not be completed on the next day nor even the day following.\r\nThis bogus subscription was already outlawed--its insertion even at the\r\npresent moment would have been criminal; how much worse the criminality\r\nif days were allowed to elapse between the legally fixed last moment for\r\nbids and the actual time at which this outlawed subscription was\r\nadmitted. And as the transaction involved the making of a large check\r\nand other formalities, it was obvious it was not one that could be\r\neasily concealed. It must be a part of the bank's records. If I but\r\nplayed aright the cards Dame Fate had put into my hands, I might yet\r\nredeem myself and save the public I had led into the trap. But as clear\r\nas the new moon against a November sky stood forth the warning that if I\r\nattempted to cut into a \"Standard Oil\" game, I must play cards their\r\nway--dispassionately, scientifically, with no sentiment nor\r\nconsideration for adversary or partner. With this conviction I went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nIt was quite early on the following morning that I met Mr. Rogers, and\r\nwithout giving him time to begin the conversation, for I was determined\r\nhe should have no provocation for the break with me that I guessed he\r\nhad on his programme, I started in:\r\n\r\n\"I have been figuring this thing out, Mr. Rogers, and I think I see\r\nthings as they are, and although I might not have handled it as you and\r\nStillman did, it is done, and the only thing to do now is to make some\r\narrangements to keep the subscribers feeling good until the stock gets\r\nto a round premium. Of course it would not do to have any slump below\r\npar until after the receipts are issued and the whole amount of the\r\nsubscriptions paid up.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers looked me over, very suspiciously at first, then brightened\r\nup, and it did not require an extra eye to see he was agreeably\r\nsurprised at my cheerful attitude. Doubtless he explained to himself the\r\nchange on the ground that \"He at last sees the dollars he is to have.\"\r\n\r\n\"What suggestion have you, Lawson, as to what should be done this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that all hands look happy, talk big, and do all possible to keep a\r\ngood premium on the stock to be delivered when issued. By the way, have\r\nyou and Stillman changed the scheme about putting all the cash received\r\nbehind the stock?\"\r\n\r\nThis I asked in as mild a tone as possible, and tried to convey by my\r\nvoice the suggestion, \"Because you may have had good reason to, and if\r\nyou have I will not kick over the traces.\" It took every ounce of\r\nwill-power in my armament to keep from grating my teeth as I so spoke.\r\n\r\nAgain his eyes bored piercingly into mine, and I felt as though all the\r\nman's mental faculties were ranged to assail me, but I guess I ran the\r\ngauntlet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"we have changed it some. The fact is, Lawson, I\r\nhave agreed to leave that part wholly to Flower and Stillman, while I\r\nrun out of town for a few days.\" I had steeled myself to play the game\r\nand said not a word, but silence was a mighty effort. \"And,\" he went on,\r\n\"if I were you, Lawson, I should just dig out too for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a heartless rascal!\" was on my lips, but I gripped myself hard\r\nand pushed the insult clear way back, and made never a protest by word\r\nor look.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that won't be best,\" I said in an every-day, pondering\r\ntone. \"There are lots of sharp chaps on 'the Street' who will insist on\r\nasking questions, questions Flower cannot possibly answer, and in a jiff\r\nthey might start in to offer the subscriptions down, and before one\r\ncould whistle a bar from 'Wait Till the Clouds Roll By' the air might be\r\nfull of falling stars.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to strike home.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have you to propose?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Some one should be ready in the market to take any amount of stock--\" I\r\nargued.\r\n\r\nHe interrupted in his old aggressive way before the sentence was half\r\nout of my mouth:\r\n\r\n\"Cut that line out, Lawson; I told you Flower has that end of the affair\r\nentirely in his hands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at this point my resolution to keep quiet and play the game did\r\nalmost go by the board. For a second I literally boiled. Then there\r\nflashed before my mind's mirror the dreadful procession of the night\r\nbefore, and I once more held tight and, oh, so deferentially and\r\npolitely, like a chastened school-boy, went on:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that will be all right. I was not going to suggest that you let me\r\ninterfere with Flower's plans, for I can gather, Mr. Rogers, that you\r\nand the others have decided on doing things your own way, and you can\r\nrest easy I shall not interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's something like, Lawson,\" he said, with a heartiness I could see\r\nwas from the lower hold. \"That's the way to look at a big thing of this\r\nkind, and if we all just pull together for a while we shall have your\r\nold plans going like oil again.\"\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Rogers was plainly pleased at my complaisance and the prospect\r\nof using me to gather in another harvest of dollars later. Playing my\r\ngame, I pursued:\r\n\r\n\"Is it fair, Mr. Rogers, to ask what arrangements Stillman has made for\r\nloaning money to those who may want to borrow on their subscriptions?\r\nYou know we gave out before the subscription was opened that the City\r\nBank would loan on the stock?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one of the things I was going to tell you, Lawson. Flower is\r\ngoing to let it be known that any one and every one who cares to, can\r\nborrow the remaining seventy-five per cent. at the City at going rates,\r\nso there will be no excuse for any one selling.\"\r\n\r\nThere it was as plain as a haystack: it was the old trap, the old\r\nambush; within were the victims lured there by the cupidity which I had\r\nplayed upon; the bars were up now and \"Standard Oil\" was ready to begin\r\nits familiar trick of going through their clothes.\r\n\r\nAlready \"Standard Oil\" had laid its hands on the amount each subscriber\r\nhad paid in, which represented twenty-five per cent. of the total value\r\nof the shares allotted. The National City Bank would generously loan the\r\nbalance. A little later an accomplice would cause a flurry in the\r\nmarket. The loans would be called and, automatically, the stock,\r\ntogether with the money that had been paid for it, would fall into the\r\ngreedy maws of Rockefeller and Rogers. No fluttering fly was ever so\r\nsurely enmeshed and at the mercy of weaving spider as the unfortunates\r\nwhom I had so decoyed to the \"Standard Oil\" web. With the most valiant\r\nassumption of indifference, I continued:\r\n\r\n\"That being the case, it cannot possibly interfere with Flower's set-out\r\nfor me to spread the news, too, that any one who wants to borrow the\r\nbalance of his subscription can get it from Stillman's Bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do better than that, Lawson,\" said Mr. Rogers with an air of\r\nreal cordiality. \"You can let it be known to the brokers and the Wall\r\nStreet men that any good house can borrow all it wants on Amalgamated to\r\nthe extent of ninety cents on the dollar. Of course, this won't be for\r\nirresponsible outsiders, for the stock might break below ninety, but\r\ngive the word that any responsible broker can always borrow as high as\r\nninety dollars a share for those who want the stock on margin.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will help things,\" I answered. \"Now, Mr. Rogers, let me tell you\r\nwhat I have decided to do on my own hook. Don't misunderstand me; it\r\nhas nothing to do with you or the rest, and, of course, none of you will\r\nobject to my doing all I care to on my own account. As you said\r\nyesterday, one portion of our job is finished, and we have thirty-six\r\nmillions' profit. This means either cash or its equivalent, stock, which\r\nat par or over is as good as cash, at least as good as ninety, which I\r\ncan have my brokers borrow at the City. I calculate that my share is\r\nnine millions less whatever you have given away in the handling of the\r\nenterprise.\"\r\n\r\nI paused as I saw a black cloud gathering on his face at my mention of\r\nnine millions of dollars, but before he could object I went on:\r\n\r\n\"I understand, of course, that the expense and the shares you have had\r\nto give to others represent a huge total. At the same time there have\r\nbeen huge profits on the side. There is no necessity to enter upon what\r\nis coming to me just now, but what I intended to say was this: I have\r\nmillions with you and Mr. Rockefeller--millions more than I owe you on\r\naccount of Butte and other Boston stocks of the second section. Now, I\r\npropose to take a million or two of that and start in on my account to\r\nsupport the market right from this morning; independent of Flower or\r\nyour other operations, I will see if I cannot get up a good feeling.\"\r\n\r\nAt once the frown relaxed and his set features broke into a smile of\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\"That's something like it, Lawson,\" he said. \"When you get down to real\r\nbusiness we never have differences. It is only when you start up that\r\nconfounded croaking about what we must do for the people, that I get\r\nangry.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Rogers,\" I answered. \"Let those things drop and, as you\r\nsay, we'll keep down to business. How much can I depend upon drawing\r\nfrom my account this morning, provided I want it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How will two millions do?\" he answered cheerily.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"All right; I will notify Stillman that you or your brokers may want to\r\nborrow up to that, and if you need the Amalgamated stock, you can have\r\nit at any time. I will leave word to that effect with Curtis.\"\r\n\r\nCurtis was William Rockefeller's secretary and right-hand man, who then\r\nhandled the details of all their financial matters.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving I indicated to Mr. Rogers the details of my proposed\r\nactions, and explained that I had sent for my principal Boston brokers\r\nwho would be with me on Wall Street to help steer the craft. Evidently\r\nmy plans met his personal approval. Indeed, from the change that had\r\ncome over his manner I realized that he felt he had been spared a\r\ndisagreeable task and that my shift had been a pleasant surprise to him.\r\nIt was plain that he and Stillman had decided that I must be thrown to\r\nthe sharks if I kept on my old tack, and were therefore gratified to\r\nfind that I was not only ready to assist in steering the ship their way,\r\nbut also willing to feed the engines coal at my own expense to keep up\r\nher speed. In spite of Mr. Rogers' confidence in Governor Flower's\r\nability to take care of the market, it was a great relief to his mind to\r\nknow that I should be there, for he realized that no one, however able\r\nand popular--and Governor Flower was both to an unusual degree--could\r\npossibly take up such an intricate bunch of lines as those with which we\r\nhad been driving, without a lot of feeling-out practice.\r\n\r\nThere was another aspect of the situation that had been suggested to me\r\nby a certain passing twitch of his lip that I had noted when I had said\r\nI proposed putting some of my own millions behind the market. It was as\r\nthough the tongue had involuntarily started to lap the chops for blood,\r\nand I scribbled a memo on my mind's black-board, \"Think over whether he\r\ndoes not intend to set traps for your share of the spoils.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING AFTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of intense relief that I left Mr. Rogers and\r\nreturned to the Waldorf. At last I knew where I \"was at\": I was to play\r\na lone hand; my enemies were in front; there were no partners from whose\r\ntreacherous knife-blades I should have to protect my back. The path was\r\nclear, and as I examined my position, I felt my old self again. Promptly\r\nI called up my Boston brokers, who were at the Holland House, to say I\r\nwould drop in for them on my way downtown, and with a clear plan of\r\ncampaign in my mind, I determined to face the breakfasting crowd in the\r\nbig café downstairs.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately I found myself in the centre of a knot of men who\r\nbegan eagerly to press me for further particulars of the Amalgamated\r\nsubscriptions. We all know the story of the comedian informed in the\r\nmidst of a performance of his beloved wife's death, who yet must laugh\r\nand antic to the end of the play. I appreciated the heavy-hearted\r\nactor's plight as I surveyed the little throng so vitally interested in\r\ntheir dollar affairs. I longed to mount a chair and tell them how they\r\nhad been duped, but my rôle called for different lines. It was my part\r\nto feign satisfaction and my duty to keep every cent invested in our\r\nenterprise from shrinking a mill. I pumped as much enthusiasm into my\r\nspeech as possible.\r\n\r\n\"You see what the papers say,\" I said. \"That gives you all the\r\ninformation I have, for although you may not think it, I have been\r\nspending the night just as the rest of you have--in lands where all\r\nflotations sell away over par. I'm going down to Wall Street just now.\r\nAfter a while I'll have more to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThe flutter of an eyelash, a hair-breadth of hesitation, a mumbled word\r\nand there may be born in the mind of the investor that instinctive\r\ndistrust which is the beginning of panic. In a stock market as in a\r\npowder magazine there are always dread possibilities of explosion, and\r\nhe who would survive must have incombustible nerves and an ice-packed\r\nbrain; asbestos assurances and an unblushing swagger have averted many\r\nmoney conflagrations and set prices hill-climbing.\r\n\r\nMy little congregation had all the fluttering fugitiveness of the\r\ninvestor-out-for-quick profits, and after a few generalities, I got down\r\nto the one question they all longed to ask but none dared to\r\nvoice--\"What can I sell my subscription for if I want to part with it?\"\r\nRaising my voice a trifle and looking straight at them:\r\n\r\n\"Don't get excited about what you read in print these next few days,\" I\r\nsaid, as though some one had asked me the question, \"for there will be\r\nhogsheads of rumors unhooped, and remember that rumor prices are never\r\nreal money. The papers this morning say that any one can sell at 40 to\r\n60 per cent. profit, but that hardly seems reasonable to me; in fact, if\r\nI were any of you who have been allotted stock and could get such profit\r\nas that overnight, I'd take it. All I'll do just now is this: I will\r\ngive 110 for any amount any of you want to sell, provided you sell right\r\nnow--and 10 per cent. profit is not so bad when you come to think it's\r\n40 per cent. on what actual money you have put up.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vernacular of stocks this process I used is called \"moulding\r\npublic opinion\" and \"making a market,\" and it had the expected effect on\r\nthat bright May morning which followed the closing day of the\r\nAmalgamated flotation. I was not offered a share; in fact, there was a\r\nloud guffaw, and it was a hundred to one wager that as I passed on to\r\nanother group each listener tumbled over his neighbor to get in first.\r\n\"110! That's a good joke! I wonder if he takes us for children!\r\nEvidently he is out early this morning to catch any stray worms napping!\r\n110 for something worth 160!\"\r\n\r\nInside of ten minutes it was all over the Waldorf and on the wires,\r\n\"Look out for Lawson! He's trying to get Amalgamated at 110.\" And by the\r\ntime I got to the Holland, a block down the Avenue, the brokers and\r\ninvestors gathered there were ready to give me the laugh with \"You're\r\nout early, we see, to pick up a bundle of easy money.\"\r\n\r\nMy first task had been accomplished to my own satisfaction. Inside of an\r\nhour it would be flashed over the world that there was a firm reliable\r\nmarket at 110 bid and almost any price asked for Amalgamated, and while\r\n110 was not anything like the wild 140 to 160 that rumor gossiped of, it\r\nrepresented such a good profit that it was sure to set the market off\r\nwith an all-round chipperness.\r\n\r\nMy readers must bear in mind that as yet there was no real Amalgamated\r\nstock which could be sold, and no place to sell it if there had been,\r\nfor until each subscriber received official notice no one really knew\r\nfor certain that he had been allotted any stock, and until the\r\nAmalgamated shares were listed on the Stock Exchange, there could be no\r\nreliable market, although they could be traded in on the curb.\r\n\r\nAt the Holland House, I quickly outlined to my chief brokers my plans\r\nfor the day. Then together we started for Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThe hours that followed were busy ones, and confusing as well. Wall\r\nStreet was a-buzz with curiosity and from all sides poured questions.\r\n\"The Street,\" it was evident, had awakened to the fact that the\r\nsituation in Amalgamated disclosed a different line-up of conditions\r\nfrom that which it had anticipated. As to whether the change was good or\r\nbad no one dared hazard a guess. For the first time in my experience,\r\nWall Street was completely at sea. The shrewdest plungers and\r\nmanipulators, men to whom the tape yields up its secrets as the penitent\r\nto the priest; to whom the ticker babbles the inner mysteries of\r\ndirectors' meetings and deep-down deals--these men whose eyes, ears, and\r\nnoses decades of stock-play had trained to supernatural acuteness were\r\nas impotent to track the truth as the veriest tyro. All admitted that\r\nthe conditions were unusual, that the subscriptions had far exceeded\r\nexpectation, that time would be required to get them straightened out.\r\nBecause of this it was natural that the market should be slow and in the\r\nabsence of definite facts it might easily look one price and be another.\r\nIf the subscription really were 412 millions and if each subscriber\r\nwould have a fifth of his allotment, then there was the usual chance for\r\ntrick playing and \"Standard Oil\" might be scheming to gather in this\r\nvaluable stock at 110 when its proper price mayhap was 140 to 160 or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn Wall Street the best brains of all the Western world centre. Fortunes\r\nare there waiting for brains to carve and take; stacked up there are\r\nmillions which he who has brains can pocket without a \"by-your-leave.\"\r\nWall Street is the millionnaire's checker-board, but brains direct the\r\nmoves and make the plays. And with all its mordant wisdom, cynical\r\ncunning, cold suspicion, Wall Street was baffled.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to continue my campaign of smiles and\r\ncheerfulness, repeat my 110 bid in every quarter possible, and so keep\r\nup the delusion. Late that afternoon I saw Mr. Rogers, who eagerly\r\ninterrogated me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Lawson, what do you make out?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the most mixed-up mess 'the Street' has ever wrestled with,\" I\r\nreplied, \"but one thing is clear: no one will dare to sell much until he\r\nreceives notice of just what he has been allotted, and then most will be\r\ntimid about selling until they have received the receipts. I don't see\r\nhow, if nothing definite leaks out, there can be much danger until after\r\nthey get their hands on the receipts, and by that time, of course, you\r\nwill have a fine market organized to take care of any offerings.\"\r\n\r\nHe flinched. I saw again that I had touched his sore spot, for at every\r\nfaintest suggestion that our profits should be used to protect the\r\nmarket, he became as shy as a pick-pocket at a police parade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nI WALK THE PLANK\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a bunch of school-boys who, having sneaked under a\r\ncorner of the circus tent, are prowling furtively round the show in holy\r\nterror lest some one who has seen their entry may be awaiting a chance\r\nto nab them? One minute they are tasting the raptures of being under the\r\ncanvas; the next, longing to be safely outside. That is about how Wall\r\nStreet felt on the memorable Friday after the Amalgamated flotation. The\r\nsame feeling prevailed generally on Saturday, though I was obliged to\r\nbuy a few blocks of the stock at 110 from Wall Street men whose sharp\r\nnoses had sniffed a carrion scent in the air. Sunday was uncomfortable,\r\nfor I realized that I might have to face bad conditions on the morrow.\r\nOn Monday an ominous feeling began to rise and pervade \"the Street\" like\r\na miasma mist in a tropical swamp. The bacillus of distrust had started\r\nits infection. I had to buy quite a lot of subscriptions and was now\r\nvarying the price from 110, for it seemed possible any moment that\r\nsomething would break loose.\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions when on Tuesday a telephone call came from Mr.\r\nRogers asking me to drop round to 26 Broadway, as he had an important\r\nmatter to talk over with me. I reported at the appointed time. Mr.\r\nRogers was evidently full of business.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"we have figured everything up and balanced accounts,\r\nand each member of the different syndicates is to be given his share,\r\ncash and stock, at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I answered. \"That suits me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" he continued pleasantly. \"Mr. Rockefeller has had Curtis\r\nfigure up your account, and while in the rush he may not have got\r\neverything in, he's fairly accurate. From what you said about getting\r\nyour affairs into shape to help the market, it occurred to me you might\r\nlike to have your balance of this section in hand ready for use. I have\r\nthe statement here, and if you find it all right I'll go upstairs and\r\nget all it calls for fixed up at once.\"\r\n\r\nWe were in the little glass pen where most of our conferences took\r\nplace. I, with my elbows on the small mahogany table, sat looking across\r\nat him leaning back in his chair. Without knowing what was to happen,\r\nbut from a certain suppressed eagerness I had detected under his frigid\r\ncomposure, I had a strong conviction that he was nerving himself for a\r\ncoup of some kind. I realized that he and Mr. Rockefeller had talked me\r\nover pretty thoroughly and had decided that they had best run this\r\ngauntlet as soon as possible. Since Mr. Rogers had broached the\r\nsubstitution of Anaconda for the properties originally intended for the\r\nfirst section of Amalgamated, I had felt that this balancing of accounts\r\nwould be a crucial affair, and after the recent turn of the screw, I\r\nhardly knew what to expect, but was ready for the worst. Now a swift\r\nthrill of apprehension suggested I'd better look for real deviltry.\r\nThere was perhaps a minute's delay while he fumbled in his pocket and\r\ndrew out letters and papers. My blood steeplechased in my veins as I\r\nwaited for him to deal me the hand that might decide my fate. In such\r\ntense moments thoughts flash in and out of the mind like lightning, and\r\nas I watched him rise, the fateful paper in his hand, it came over me\r\nwith a sharp exultation that however the trumps fell it was a great\r\ngame--great even for this king of gamesters who was about to play his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHenry H. Rogers looked piercingly into my eyes and said: \"There's the\r\naccount, Lawson.\" He laid on the table in front of me an oblong piece of\r\npaper. On it were some lines of words followed by other lines of\r\nfigures. That was all. I spread it out carefully between my two hands\r\nand bent over it. Then I looked up. Before I allowed the significance of\r\nthe figures to penetrate my mind, I wished to know exactly what they\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n\"If I understand aright, Mr. Rogers,\" I asked, \"this statement does not\r\ntake in our Boston deals nor my loans on the Butte and other affairs,\r\nbut is a settlement of this first section only--a final clearing-up\r\nshowing just what my twenty-five per cent. of the Amalgamated and the\r\nthings connected with it amount to? Am I right?\"\r\n\r\nMy voice was even and calmly business-like, and he answered in exactly\r\nthe same tone.\r\n\r\n\"It shows where you stand on this particular affair, and gives your\r\nbalance of stock and cash, which we are ready to pay over in whole or in\r\npart, in case you may want to leave some of it against the loans on the\r\nother section.\"\r\n\r\nI turned to the paper; I leaned over it, letting my two hands with the\r\nelbows resting on the table support my head. Mr. Rogers could see only\r\nthe back and top of my head, no part of my face. At the first glance I\r\ncaught the balance--it was a little less than two millions and a half.\r\nAt once the other lines upon the sheet became a crimson blur. Into my\r\nmind rushed an avalanche of figures and facts which seemed to prove\r\nirresistibly that I should have read nine millions in place of the\r\nnumbers that were burning themselves into my brain. But what if it were\r\nrightly but two and a half millions, and the great sum on which all my\r\nmarket movements had been predicated was a hideous miscalculation on my\r\npart? Then inevitably was I hopelessly bankrupt, or saved from that only\r\nto find my neck irrevocably caught in the \"Standard Oil\" noose. I strove\r\nfiercely to steady my nerves, to arrest the stampeding terrors that had\r\nbroken loose in my brain. There came to me a feverish memory of the\r\nhideous procession of Thursday's midnight vigil. I desperately\r\nasseverated to myself, \"I must be cool, I must, I must.\" But all my\r\nresolutions went as goes the powder when touched by the match. In an\r\ninstant more nothing in the world mattered; I sprang to my feet, kicked\r\nover the chair, and with an exclamation which was half yell, half\r\nimprecation, I stuck the paper under Mr. Rogers' eyes. On the balance\r\nline I beat a tattoo with my trembling forefinger. Heaven knows what I\r\nsaid, for all barriers were down and a flood-tide of rage, overwhelming,\r\nterrific, swept my being. There was no chance for Mr. Rogers to answer\r\nor to interrupt me. Suddenly I became conscious that I was asking, \"Am I\r\nto understand that this is final? Is this what I get for all I have\r\nstood for?\" My voice as I heard it was strange--a hoarse hiss--and the\r\nwords fell on my ear like a death sentence. \"No, by God, no!\" I sprang\r\nbetween him and the door.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, in the name of Heaven, stop for a second; there is some\r\nmistake; I see there is some mistake, some terrible blunder that they\r\nhave made upstairs. Don't say another word. Give me that paper and I'll\r\ntake it to Mr. Rockefeller. He will see what is wrong; he and I'll go\r\nover it together and you shall have what's right. I will be back in a\r\nfew minutes and I swear to you you shall have your full share. Yes, I\r\nswear to you you shall have what you say is right, even if it takes\r\nevery dollar of the profits, every dollar.\"\r\n\r\nI handed him the paper without a word and he was out of the room. I\r\nheard gates bang and knew he had, as he promised, \"gone upstairs.\" I\r\nlocked the door and waited. I shall never forget the racking torture of\r\nthat period of inaction. To make real all the terrors I was suffering it\r\nwould be necessary for me to enter into elaborate details of the\r\nwide-spread financial commitment into which I had been led by my\r\nrelationship with the Consolidation. I was staggering under immense\r\nlines of Boston \"Coppers,\" which were to be included in the second\r\nsection of Amalgamated, but had been purchased to make part of the first\r\nsection. Some of these Mr. Rockefeller was carrying for me; the rest\r\nwere portioned among two dozen banks, trust companies, and brokers. With\r\na portion of the profits I had legitimately calculated upon, I had\r\nproposed to lighten my burden and to devote the balance to carrying\r\nthrough the contract I had taken on my shoulders of protecting\r\nAmalgamated stock in the market. To do so on this showing would be out\r\nof the question; more than ever should I be at \"Standard Oil's\" mercy.\r\nThe dangers that threatened me assumed cyclopean proportions as I\r\nmarshalled them. Suddenly another possibility flashed across my brain,\r\n\"What if they should tell you that having refused what was fair, you\r\nshould have nothing--that you could go to the devil and fight? Then\r\nwhere would you be?\" That meant ruin, crushing, irrevocable, complete; a\r\nseries of disasters, so portentously realistic, began a cinematographic\r\nprocession across my disordered brain, that I found myself shivering in\r\nanticipation, when suddenly the door-knob clicked and I jumped to my\r\nfeet to admit Mr. Rogers. In his hand was the paper. I had eyes for it\r\nalone. I took it from his outstretched fingers and devoured its\r\ncontents. It was the same sheet, the same word \"balance,\" but underneath\r\nthe old figures was a line below which appeared a new set of ciphers,\r\nshowing just a fraction under five millions of dollars. In the brief\r\ninterval of minutes my balance had doubled. Before I could utter a word,\r\nwith his hand on my arm to arrest my attention, Mr. Rogers was\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, one word before you open your mouth. Remember I said you should\r\nbe satisfied. Mr. Rockefeller agrees with me. He is convinced these\r\nfigures now are right, but wants me to tell you if you believe they are\r\nnot, to make your own and you'll have what they call for.\"\r\n\r\nAs I said before, Henry H. Rogers knows the human animal, and in the\r\nintimate intercourse of preceding years he had had ample opportunity to\r\nlearn those very human characteristics which go to the blending of my\r\nindividuality. It is a weakness of which I am intensely conscious, yet\r\ncannot altogether regret, to be easily moved by any show of generosity\r\nand fairness, however specious. When I saw the new figures and realized\r\nthat all the hell I had conjured up was no more than a nightmare, a very\r\nrapture of gratitude and relief seized me. It was not that I lost sight\r\nof the fact that this new balance was far below what I knew was my\r\nright, for according to the lowest computation my proper share was nine\r\nmillions; nor that I failed to realize that I was in the power of this\r\nman whose greed, callousness, and brutal obstinacy in the face of\r\nopposition no one knew better than I. Still, though his unusual\r\ndeference convinced me that by continued, fiery insistence I could force\r\nfrom him the remaining four millions (for the one thing Standard Oil\r\nnever lets get into court is a dispute over a division of profits on a\r\njoint stock deal), the first shock had been so awful, and the reaction\r\nwas so sudden, that my whole being revolted at the idea of further\r\nwrangle. Indeed, I was in the same condition as the man whose runaway\r\nhorse suddenly stops just as the children in the roadway seemed doomed\r\nto be crushed and beaten to death beneath its iron heels. He condones\r\nthe running away in gratitude for the timely halt. A glad voice within\r\nme seemed to be saying, \"It's all right, all right--that's money enough\r\nto fight him out with--that's ammunition for victory--victory for\r\nyourself, for the friends who have banked on your ability to protect\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nI said to Mr. Rogers: \"Tell Mr. Rockefeller I thank him for his\r\nfairness. I thank you both. I'm satisfied and this is settled.\" I put my\r\nfinger on the account which lay on the table.\r\n\r\nYes, I positively thanked these men who had tried to rob me of\r\nseventy-five per cent. of all the millions that I had earned by all the\r\nlaws _of the game_, and that I so urgently needed to protect those whom\r\nI had lured to probable destruction; needed as a mother in the desert\r\nneeds milk to keep life in her babe. I thanked these men in heartfelt\r\nterms because they had returned me an additional third of my own money.\r\nIdiot, you say. I went further; I shook Mr. Rogers by the hand, and as\r\nthe tears gathered in his eyes I said, and it was from the heart, too:\r\n\r\n\"Don't think, Mr. Rogers, that I shall ever lay up this day against you\r\nand Mr. Rockefeller, or that I shall resent not getting all I believed I\r\nshould have had. I want you both to understand that I do know I am\r\nentitled to more, but it ends here. I will cherish no ill-feeling, for\r\nthis balance is amply sufficient to enable me to do what I intended to\r\ndo, and--there is more on earth than millions.\"\r\n\r\nWe were both emotionally excited; I from relief at escaping the clutches\r\nof that dread hell of which for certain moments I had felt the flaming\r\ngrasp; he because of a sudden degrading realization that he had\r\nattempted to practise on a faithful comrade in arms a cowardly and\r\ncontemptible piece of treachery. My impulsive gratitude for the measure\r\nof justice granted me made his avaricious greed seem even to him\r\ndespicable, and for an instant Henry H. Rogers was honestly ashamed.\r\n\r\nSome years have elapsed since this episode, but a thousand times I\r\nsuppose the scene has arisen to rack Henry H. Rogers with bitter\r\nmemories of his baseness. The severest punishments are not those that we\r\nmortals inflict on our fellows whom for violations of our little earthly\r\nlaws we clap in striped suits and shackle with steel bracelets. What are\r\nstriped suits which imprint no mark on the body of the wearer, or\r\nhandcuffs that any blacksmith can strike off at a blow, in comparison\r\nwith the ever-recurring torture of the white-hot iron with which God\r\nsears the hearts and brains of those sinners whose wrong-doing is beyond\r\nhuman retribution? What memories of prison and disgrace are comparable\r\nwith the exquisite suffering of the undetected criminal who in the dark\r\nwatches of the night pores over the bitter scroll of his delinquencies?\r\nWhen Henry H. Rogers reads the record set down here of this faithless\r\nand degrading action, he will suffer infinitely more than ever I did for\r\nthe loss of the gold he and his associates so meanly filched. Nor will\r\nthe knowledge of the seven and a half score of millions marshalled ready\r\nat his nod, abate one jot or tittle of the measure of his humiliation\r\nand shame.\r\n\r\nPeace having been established, Mr. Rogers sent \"upstairs\" for the checks\r\nand stocks to complete the settlement, and while we waited we talked,\r\nand, as was inevitable after so strenuous a session, we found ourselves\r\nback on the sincere and frankly friendly footing of our earlier\r\nintercourse. A knock-down and attempted drag-out which at the end is\r\ndeclared a draw invariably promotes cordiality between the principals,\r\nand ours was no exception to the rule. Evidently Mr. Rogers had been\r\ndoing considerable thinking since our last conversation and had\r\naccumulated troublesome ideas which had to be worked off. My mood at the\r\nmoment seemed made to order for the purpose, and he ran over our\r\naffairs, one after another, until he thought it safe to explode his\r\nbomb. He rang for a clerk, and instructed that Mr. Stillman be called up\r\nand asked to send over \"that paper if it was ready.\" Soon afterward the\r\nmessenger returned with a big, square package. Mr. Rogers opened it.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson,\" he said, \"here's the whole story. Stillman has been steadily\r\nat work and has just finished two copies of the entire subscription. I\r\nthink you ought to look it over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look it over,\" I repeated. \"Why, it is of the utmost importance to the\r\nwhole enterprise that I study every name. I alone can tell just what\r\nthat list means. After I've been over it I'll know pretty thoroughly who\r\nwill hold, who will want to sell, who must sell, and who will need\r\nencouragement.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I thought,\" he answered, with an air of high approval.\r\nThen, dropping to his most friendly and confidential key, the tone of\r\nvoice that never fails to persuade an associate that he is in on the\r\nbottom floor and that all others are outsiders, he went on: \"And more\r\nthan that, Lawson, why cannot you get in touch with all those\r\nsubscribers who are disappointed at the amounts they received and sell\r\nthem what they want?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers leaned back to appraise the effect of this startling\r\nproposition on me. At any other moment I should inevitably have broken\r\nloose again, but the fascination of his personality was upon me and I\r\nlet him spin his webs. Any man, and there are scores adrift, who falls\r\nunder the spell of Henry H. Rogers, invariably, as did the suitors of\r\nCirce, pays the penalty of his indiscretion. Some he uses and\r\ncontemptuously casts aside useless; others he works, plays, and\r\npensions; still others serve as jackals or servitors and proudly flaunt\r\nhis livery; a few, the strong, independent souls, tempted with great\r\nrewards and beguiled by the man's baleful, intellectual charm into his\r\nclutches, preserve a semblance of freedom; but let the boldest of these\r\nturn restive--he is maimed or garroted with sickening promptitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nPERFECTING THE DOUBLE CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get back to my story. I realized that though one disaster had been\r\naverted, I was far from any haven of rest. Remembering my cue, however,\r\nI asked innocently:\r\n\r\n\"Have you all decided to sell more of the stock, Mr. Rogers?\"\r\n\r\n\"All? Why no,\" he said. \"Just let me show you where we stand now. All\r\nthe unsold stock, roughly forty-eight millions, has been divided up and\r\neach man has to carry his own. That's easy, because Stillman will carry\r\nthem all at the bank, for they are all good, Lewisohn, Morgan, Olcott,\r\nFlower, Daly, and the others. The only loose stock will be Mr.\r\nRockefeller's, yours, and mine, and that we must turn into money before\r\nwe can bring out the second section. You have been losing sight of the\r\nfact, Lawson, that we have millions upon millions tied up here, and Mr.\r\nRockefeller has decided he will not go ahead until we have turned this\r\nventure into money.\"\r\n\r\nMarvellous, marvellous man! He unrolled the new scheme as openly and as\r\nfreely as though he were a world's philanthropist explaining a new\r\nbenefaction and I an enthusiastic minister employed to carry the glad\r\ntidings to the people. The plot was obvious. In spite of Flower and\r\nStillman and all the talk of our taking a rest he was back on his black\r\ncourser again, in a new saddle, with a freshly lighted lantern, and the\r\nold blackjack newly leaded. And I was the only one who could stalk the\r\ngame. I listened.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me show you, Lawson, what a pretty campaign I have laid out,\"\r\nhe went on. \"I've pledged all the others to hold their stock and I've\r\ngot it rigged in such a way they can't let go a share without my knowing\r\nof it. Then I've got them all enthusiastic and have formed a pool at\r\nFlower's office which, if necessary, can buy 500,000 shares, and what\r\nwith the money they have made and the promise that they will be let in\r\non the second section if they're good, we ought to have things pretty\r\nmuch our own way.\"\r\n\r\nThe scheme seemed to be perfect for robbing every one in sight, and here\r\nwas I being taken right in--I who had but one thought: to get those I\r\nhad mired on to firm soil and myself outside the breastworks of this\r\npirate stronghold.\r\n\r\n\"It looks perfect, Mr. Rogers,\" I said. \"Now where do I come in on all\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders impatiently. \"You see as well as I can tell\r\nyou,\" he replied evasively.\r\n\r\n\"I take it that you want me to unload our stock on to the pool and the\r\nother members of the syndicate?\" I asked with a brutal frankness that I\r\nrealized, after I heard the words, was almost indecent.\r\n\r\n\"What is the use of putting it that way, Lawson?\" he replied angrily.\r\n\"You know I mean nothing of the sort. You know I want you to keep every\r\none you can from selling, and simply supply the legitimate demand that\r\ncan be worked up among the subscribers all over the country. If worked\r\nas you can work it, this ought to clean up our stock without any one's\r\nbeing hurt.\"\r\n\r\nI understood perfectly. If Mr. Rogers and I had been on terms of\r\nflippancy instead of dignity, at this stage we should have given each\r\nother the wink. Just what he wanted done I knew. He knew I knew what he\r\nwanted, and I knew he knew I knew, and yet we were pretending not only\r\nthat we knew nothing but that there was really nothing to know.\r\n\r\nFortunately, at this stage of the duel Mr. Rogers' secretary arrived\r\nwith my checks and stock, and while we were verifying these, I had time\r\nto study my mental chess-board for the next move. The papers were all\r\npassed at last and then I entered into some explanation of my own\r\nintentions. I told Mr. Rogers that for the time being I would hold all\r\nmy stock, but that I intended to borrow a stack of money on it from\r\nStillman through my brokers, for I fully intended to support the\r\nmarket, as my belief in the stock was absolute.\r\n\r\nI could have sworn Mr. Rogers inwardly chuckled at my fatuity, but I\r\nwent right on:\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Rockefeller has decided that your share and his of the allotment\r\nmust, in whole or in part, be turned into money before the second\r\nsection is tackled, there's nothing for it but to go ahead, and I will\r\nput in great work for you (I didn't add, \"my work, if I can make it,\r\nwill keep you in as long as the public have a share\"), because,\" said I,\r\n\"my one ambition now is to complete the second section and get things in\r\nsuch shape that those people I have had locked-in so long can get out,\r\nif they care to.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an intricate problem that was thus settled, for Mr. Rogers well\r\nknew that it would be useless to attempt to sell big quantities of\r\nAmalgamated without my detecting it, and he dared not ask me to have a\r\nhand in his plot without including my own stock. When he saw I intended\r\nto stand by my baby, and yet was so anxious to get to the second section\r\nthat I would accede to Mr. Rockefeller's wishes, he perceived that the\r\nsituation was ideal for his purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Let me glance over that subscription list,\" I said; and I opened up the\r\nbook, for book it really was.\r\n\r\nMy readers may surmise how intense was my interest in scanning the\r\nresults of my work. This great stack of bank sheets before me was the\r\nofficial list of the subscription, stitched together in seventeen\r\nsections of twenty pages each; twenty-eight names, with city, State,\r\nstreet number addresses, and amounts subscribed to a page, all in ink in\r\nlonghand.\r\n\r\n\"Better take them with you to the hotel and go carefully over the names\r\nand amounts,\" put in Mr. Rogers. \"It certainly is a long job, but one\r\nthat you must tackle some time, and the sooner the better.\"\r\n\r\nHere was the missing link in my chain of evidence, delivered directly\r\ninto my hands without a word of persuasion or cajolery. Providence\r\nplayed that hand for me surely. I concealed my jubilance by rattling\r\nalong vociferously:\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to work over this a heap, sending out circulars and what\r\nnot. It would have been better to have had it in typewriting, but I\r\nsuppose Stillman didn't dare intrust it to the machine people. However,\r\nI can divide up the seventeen sections among different people and none\r\nwill know the whole story. I will keep it in Boston with the other\r\npapers, and--gracious! what's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked, smiling at my excitement.\r\n\r\nIn front of me was the section beginning with the \"Mc's,\" and the\r\nlargest subscription on the page was 6,000 shares--1,200 allotment. I\r\nfollowed the line back to the name. It was that of Hugh McLaughlin, then\r\nthe big \"boss\" of Brooklyn, who, like all the other big bosses of New\r\nYork State, was a trusted lieutenant of \"Standard Oil.\" I put my finger\r\non the amount and said:\r\n\r\n\"You have taken care of your friend across the river, I see. No wonder\r\nall the politicians were so anxious to get in, for they know you would\r\nnot put this old gentleman into anything that is not pretty sure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers nodded wisely:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I told the old stalwart he had better have about half a million,\r\nbut he went $100,000 better, I see. I sent the word around to the\r\nothers, too, but have not had a chance to go over the list carefully.\r\nHave they all gone in under their own names?\"\r\n\r\nI ran over page after page, looking for names as he called them off, but\r\nmost of them had disguised their ventures through dummies. We had no\r\ntrouble in putting our fingers on their allotments, however; Mr. Rogers\r\ncommenting in his sage and caustic way on men and politics. It was\r\ngrowing late, and at a natural stopping-place in our talk I sent for\r\npaper and string, with my own hands tied up the book, and--with all the\r\nairs of extreme leisureliness--literally bolted.\r\n\r\nNo school-boy with a three-pound trout caught in a deep hole under a big\r\nwillow bearing the sign, \"Any one fishing here will be prosecuted,\" no\r\nburglar with an unexpected fat swag, was ever in such a fever to lug his\r\nbooty to a concealed place as I to get that infinitely precious bundle\r\nto the Waldorf. At last I landed it in my room and began to scan the\r\ninteresting pages. My first thought was to look for our own big dummy\r\nsubscription. As I supposed, it was not there. _Roughly I added the\r\ntotals of the different sheets and compared them, with the 412 millions\r\nwe had given the public, which was now indelibly, the world over, a\r\nmatter of record._ Again I stopped to congratulate myself on my good\r\nfortune in securing this first-hand evidence of the fraud that had been\r\npractised on the people.\r\n\r\nI leaned over the thick pages with their various inscriptions. The names\r\nand addresses carried me into every corner of the United States and into\r\nthe great cities of Europe as well. Set down there were towns and\r\nvillages I had never heard of, and my mind made pictures for me of\r\nfathers, mothers, and children, beguiled by my pledges and promises,\r\nembracing the opportunity to add to their scanty hordes. But it was not\r\na moment to indulge in scares, so I slipped over the people's mites and\r\nfixed my mind on the millions.\r\n\r\nThe Lewisohns were down for eleven millions, and Mr. Rogers' old\r\ncronies, John Moore's firm, were represented by a subscription of\r\nbetween six and seven millions. As I ran over the names I found million\r\nafter million down to Mr. Rogers' friends, which told me that he had\r\nspared no one. All the lieutenants and the queer people who do the\r\nconfidential business of the \"System,\" and invariably turn up at\r\nmelon-cutting time, were down for round amounts. Conspicuous among the\r\nrest was the name of that rising votary of the \"System\" who won\r\nnotoriety, while Comptroller of the Currency under President Cleveland,\r\nas manipulator of the slick bond deal which has gone into American\r\nhistory as among the queerest performances of its period. Loaded up with\r\nGovernment banking secrets, this young man subsequently became a prize\r\nfor whom the various organizations of the \"System\" competed valorously.\r\nThere he was, in three places--James H. Eckels, President of the\r\nCommercial Bank of Chicago, 6,000, 2,000, and 2,000 shares--or a million\r\ndollars altogether.\r\n\r\nAnother name caught my eye: \"Bay State Gas Co., J. Edward Addicks,\r\n20,000 shares\"--two millions of dollars. I leaned back and laughed as I\r\nthought of this wary old fox, with the bruises and scars of the\r\n\"System's\" hopper thick all over his body, dutifully bringing his\r\ncontribution to his old enemy, Rogers. And Rogers, disdainful and\r\ncontemptuous of the man, found his $400,000 good. This, I said to\r\nmyself, is a case of spider eat spider with a vengeance; and I wondered\r\nif experience is really as good a teacher as the text-book says.\r\n\r\nHour after hour I pondered over that list, \"sizing up\" each subscriber\r\nand questioning what his financial condition might be. At last I dropped\r\nit, swearing to myself to use every effort to protect these thousands of\r\npeople who had ventured so much money on the strength of my pledges.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the allotments were officially announced; in a few days\r\nmore the receipts were issued and Amalgamated was fairly out in the\r\nworld on its own feet. It was not listed on any of the exchanges yet,\r\nbut it was very much in the mouths of people, and in the papers. And\r\nevery day grew the ominous feeling that something was wrong. It was a\r\ncontradictory situation and no one could put a finger on the trouble.\r\nRumors one heard, but no definite derogatory statements. The truth was\r\nthat those who knew what was wrong had good reasons for saying nothing,\r\nwhile all who had to do with stock affairs and surmised the evil, were\r\nthemselves loaded up with the stock and hoping against hope that our\r\npromises of great profits would yet be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt was my part to keep up these anticipations and by hook or crook\r\nprevent Rogers and Rockefeller from unloading. I bought and bought to\r\nsteady the market when no one else apparently would buy; and when I\r\nfound others whom I could induce to venture, I had them relieve those\r\nwho were faltering and who must sell. When Mr. Rogers took me to task, I\r\ninvented all manner of excuses to account for my tardiness in creating a\r\nmarket on which he could unload his holdings. He listened impatiently\r\nand incredulously, and I felt that sooner or later he would take the bit\r\nin his teeth.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my efforts the price of Amalgamated dropped and dropped and\r\nit was all I could do to prevent a quick crash. My profits--the immense\r\nsum of money I had obtained at the settlement--had been used up,\r\ntogether with the great sums I had borrowed on my own allotment of\r\nshares. At intervals I stopped long enough to make brief excursions into\r\nsugar or other stocks, out of which I captured additional hundreds of\r\nthousands, but every cent of such gains went toward staying the\r\navalanche. These indeed were days of desperation and black despair, all\r\nthe more trying because I had to look happy and talk hopefully; all the\r\nmore difficult because my enemies came out of their holes and did their\r\nshare to balk my efforts; all the more painful because the public were\r\nbeginning to doubt whether the second section was coming--and whether it\r\nhad best come--and our Boston \"Coppers\" had begun to drop in value.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I had troubled myself but little about the Flower\r\npool, which had been set going soon after the conversation in which Mr.\r\nRogers had told me that he and Mr. Rockefeller intended to unload their\r\nstock. I concluded that the pool would surely get a share of what they\r\nhad to sell, and showed no inclination to join in with it. But at last\r\nMr. Rogers said to me:\r\n\r\n\"As every one is going into the pool, Lawson, it will seem strange if\r\nyou are missing, so you had better send Flower your check and I will see\r\nyou get it back later.\"\r\n\r\n\"For how much?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand will be about right,\" he answered, and I sent it,\r\nand that was all I had heard of the subject until one day after the\r\nstock had been weaker than usual I received by mail a brusk notice from\r\nFlower & Co. to mail them another hundred thousand dollars. Immediately\r\nI called up the banking-house, and learned to my horror and astonishment\r\nthat the pool had accumulated over 225,000 shares. I went at once to Mr.\r\nRogers with Flower's call and said:\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing whatever of this affair, Mr. Rogers, and as I have not\r\nbeen unloading any of my stock and have all I can do to keep up my end\r\nanyway, you will look after it, of course.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the notice and said: \"I will attend to it.\" Remembering his\r\nintentions to unload, after what I had heard of the pool's accumulations\r\nI was not surprised at Mr. Rogers' willingness to take care of this\r\nmatter of mine. It is of interest now, in looking back over our affairs,\r\nto recall that though there were several periods later when the sledding\r\nwas hard, and I needed all the money I could lay hands on, he never\r\noffered to return me that hundred thousand, not even after the pool had\r\nliquidated, as will be shown later. In spite of this fact, in his\r\nreadiness to hurl any charge or insult at me, he had his hireling, Denis\r\nDonohoe, recently make the accusation that I alone of all its members\r\nrefused to keep up my payments to the Flower pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nA RETROSPECT AND A MORAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crime of Amalgamated and its immediate consequences are before my\r\nreaders. I have fulfilled the promise made in my foreword to expose to\r\nthe people of America the manner in which they have been plundered and\r\nthe methods by which the \"System\" habitually cheats them out of their\r\nsavings. Robbery conducted on so gigantic a scale as I have pictured\r\nmust necessarily simulate the natural processes of finance, and to\r\nunderstand the deep devices of the schemers requires a knowledge of\r\nbanking and commercial practices which the average man has no chance to\r\nattain. If I had begun my story by stating exactly what constituted the\r\ncrime of Amalgamated, my readers would not have grasped its heinousness.\r\nIn the chapters that I have devoted to leading up to it they have been\r\neducated in the piratical practices of finance and financiers, and have\r\nacquired familiarity with the jugglery of corporations and the\r\nmultiplication and division of stock certificates through which most of\r\nthe great American fortunes have been created.\r\n\r\nDepending still on the ignorance of its blinded dupes, the \"System\"\r\nagain raises its brazen face from among the poison rushes of Wall Street\r\nand hisses, \"Listen to what he calls a great crime--a simple business\r\ntransaction. It is no crime, but a common practice of modern finance and\r\nby no means unusual or extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nNo crime to take by a trick from thousands of the people thirty-six\r\nmillions of the results of our great country's prosperity? Think of what\r\nthis vast sum represents--the revenues of a year's work of 36,000 men\r\nearning each $1,000. Think of it, ye millions who dig and delve and bear\r\nheavy burdens that your mothers, wives, and children may in exchange\r\nhave a bite to eat and a couch to sleep upon!\r\n\r\nThe crime of Amalgamated, as I have explained it, constitutes a specific\r\nbreach of the banking laws of the State and nation. But the legal\r\naspects of the offence are trivial in comparison with the great moral\r\ncrime which was consummated by Henry H. Rogers and James Stillman, in\r\nthe National City Bank on that night in May, 1899. Through false\r\nrepresentations and specious pledges and the credit of the names of\r\n\"Standard Oil\" and the National City Bank, thousands of people were\r\nbeguiled into investing their savings in this Amalgamated Copper\r\nCompany. Because of the promise of great gains other thousands mortgaged\r\ntheir homes, appropriated their wives' savings, even their employers'\r\nfunds, and embarked in this fair-seeming enterprise. The greatest bank\r\nin America aided and abetted the conspiracy by the loan of its funds to\r\nlure the victims deeper into the toils. All in, the trap is sprung; the\r\nthousands are despoiled of their savings by familiar devices of finance,\r\nand throughout the land is spread a wave of misery, madness, and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nThe crime of Amalgamated, a critical correspondent writes me, is purely\r\na Wall Street offence, important to bankers and capitalists but of no\r\nconsequence to the working men, the farmers, or the toiling millions who\r\nhave no savings to invest in stocks. \"Of what concern is it to us,\" says\r\nthis writer, \"how one section of the rich robs another of its\r\nhoardings?\"\r\n\r\nPoor fool! A few men cannot deprive even a few thousands of so great a\r\nsum as $36,000,000 without working untold injury upon the entire body of\r\nthe people. Such a stupendous sum looted from the coffers of the many\r\nand piled in the vaults of three or four men unbalances the whole\r\neconomic structure of the nation. The consequences of that act do not\r\nend in the series of defalcations and bankruptcies, imprisonments and\r\nsuicides, in the ruined homes and wrecked careers that follow in its\r\nimmediate wake. In the grip of these plunderers intrenched in the\r\nstronghold of finance each of these filched millions becomes a new\r\nweapon of oppression. Because of the crime of Amalgamated every pound\r\nof food that goes to sustain life in the American people, every shingle\r\non every roof that shelters the American people, every mile of\r\ntransportation for man or freight in America; in fact, every necessity\r\nand every luxury of the American people has had added to its cost some\r\nfractional increase, representing in the aggregate tens and tens of\r\nmillions annually, which, flowing into the coffers of the \"System,\"\r\nstrengthen and extend its stupendous grip on the property of the nation.\r\n\r\nOur country for a generation has been prosperous beyond the dreams of\r\nman, yet what have the masses of our people to show for it? A better, a\r\nhigher, and a MORE EXPENSIVE standard of living--that is all. That this\r\nprosperity which is our national boast will last forever is incredible.\r\nSooner or later will come one of the times when Nature frowns and sends\r\nher floods, her droughts, and her epidemics of disease. Is the American\r\npeople prepared by its long-sustained prosperity to bridge over that\r\nperiod of want and suffering?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the mass of our population has not sufficient surplus\r\nlaid by to last over thirty days of such a calamitous interval. All the\r\nunearned increment of national prosperity the \"System\" has captured and\r\ncapitalized. Not only have the people been deprived of the profits of\r\ntheir labor, but this capitalized prosperity is the stern instrument by\r\nwhich new burdens are laid on their shoulders and new tithes are exacted\r\nfrom their wages. But for the plundering \"System\" the great mass of our\r\npeople would be able to sit in their tents in the shade of their\r\nhusbanded harvests and laugh to scorn the frowns of fortune. Now, I say,\r\nGod help the nation when Nature, tired from her great work, rests, and\r\nthe people, too, are compelled to rest--for then will come an awful\r\nawakening. When the millions face famine and realize for the first time\r\nthat their gigantic storehouses, filled to bursting with the surplus of\r\nthe past, are the property of the few who cannot even count the\r\ncontents, much less use them--when they realize that these hoarded\r\ntreasures are as far beyond their starved reach as are the violets and\r\ndaisies beyond the picking of the galley-slave, then they will\r\nappreciate how much deeper and more damnable are the crimes of the\r\n\"System,\" such crimes as Amalgamated and its like, than even such\r\nnational tragedies as the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield, and\r\nMcKinley, at each of which all the people held aloft their hands in\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the millions of intelligent, able-bodied Americans, who\r\ncould crush the tribe of Rockefeller as elephants crush snakes, rise\r\nwith each sun and dig and delve and suffer that a Rogers may wallow in\r\nwealth and an Armour gain a greater income than the Rothschilds? Why are\r\nthey so easily hoodwinked into imagining that the elaborate reports\r\ndetailing the immense and growing wealth of the country represent their\r\nown well-being and affluence? Because the wise men of the \"System\" know\r\nhuman nature, know that most men and women accept unquestioningly the\r\nconditions they find surrounding them. Each day it is pounded into the\r\nheads of the people through a hundred agencies that it is the greatest\r\nand most flourishing of peoples and that the laws and customs which\r\nregulate its lives and rights are the best in all the world. How shall\r\nthe people know that these glowing rumors, these propitious tidings, are\r\nbut the siren songs of the \"System\" under the spell of which it is\r\ndespoiled of its savings?\r\n\r\nAsk yourselves, my friends, how much you know about those familiar\r\nthings which are part of your lives as are the sunshine, the grass, and\r\nthe flowers--your Bible, your money, your playing-cards. Each is an\r\ninstitution so consecrated by custom that you accept it exactly for what\r\nit meant to your father just as he took it from his own father a\r\ngeneration before. That the Holy Book is God's message to His children,\r\nthe human race, we know because we have the words of our ancestors\r\ntherefor; the stamped silver and gold we take for granted as we do shoes\r\nand clothes, because money is an essential factor in the social fabric\r\nand the form in which it comes to us seems as inevitable as the moon or\r\nour ten fingers; humanity has gone on for hundreds of years considering\r\nthe knave of greater value than the ten-spot and the ace of higher worth\r\nthan all the rest of the pack, because it is content to believe that the\r\nrules that have been handed down apportioning these values are the best\r\nthat could be devised. With a hundred other elements and details of our\r\ndaily life, it is the same--we accept unreasoningly what we are told or\r\nwhat is given us, with no look forward or back, and, engaged with the\r\nthousand new toys and problems which Fate, the conjurer, shakes out of\r\nhis hat, we become bound by habit and blinded by precedent.\r\n\r\nThe love men have for the formulas and conventions of their daily lives\r\nis the \"System's\" opportunity for plunder, and it is this fundamental\r\nprinciple of humanity that makes my work so difficult. It would be as\r\neasy to convince the masses that their playing-cards are all wrong and\r\nthat the ace is really of lower value than the two-spot as it is to\r\nawaken them to the terrors of the conditions that are confronting them;\r\nto compel them to realize that a despotism of dollars is being organized\r\namong them; that the cherished institutions of generations are the\r\ninstruments by which a few daring schemers are concentrating into their\r\nown hands the money of the nation, and that this concentration can have\r\nno other result than the abject slavery of the American people.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWSON AND HIS CRITICS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE INSURANCE CONTROVERSY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the July, 1904, number of _Everybody's Magazine_ I announced that I\r\nproposed to give to the world a story concerned with events which had\r\ntaken place in real life--a true story.\r\n\r\nI outlined it, giving the names of the persons and events it would deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThese things happened:\r\n\r\nThe edition of the magazine was sold out in three days; my chapter was\r\nprinted in part or in full in nearly all the papers and periodicals of\r\nthe United States and Canada; many of the representative journals, even\r\nin England, published long editorials on the subject, and with but few\r\nexceptions, editorials and news comments were favorable.\r\n\r\nI was urged to continue. My second chapter appeared.\r\n\r\nThe magazine, with an additional 100,000 copies, was sold out in two\r\ndays. The press took hold of the matter with even greater interest than\r\nit had accorded my first chapter.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter met with a still more cordial reception. The edition\r\nof the magazine, although increased another 100,000, sold out as before,\r\nand my mail expanded to a degree that surprised me. In addition to\r\nthousands of press notices and criticisms, I received ever so many\r\nletters from all classes of Americans and Canadians--teachers of the\r\nWord of God, and members of the flocks who are taught, earnest statesmen\r\nand insincere politicians, millionnaires and paupers, anarchists,\r\nsocialists, municipal-ownershipists, and the hundred and one travelers\r\non the beaten highways and lowways of life, who, spurred by ambition or\r\nunrest, pantingly seek a chance to blaze a way for the trudging millions\r\nof the future to that goal of all ambitious and restless dreamers--a\r\npeople's Utopia. Nearly all appealed to me to give them the word as to\r\nthe ultimate intention of \"Frenzied Finance\"--\"Is it only to point to\r\nthe sores, or will it prick them with its long sharp point and will its\r\ndouble edge cut the flesh in which they are rooted?\" Others required\r\nfurther information or explanation about the subjects I had treated;\r\nanother section questioned my statements and found fault with my\r\ndisclosures. The volume of these communications and criticisms finally\r\nbecame so large and they were so urgent in tone that I made up my mind\r\nit was necessary to devise some fair and intelligent way to remove the\r\nwriters' difficulties and resolve their doubts. The modern surgeon finds\r\nthe preparation of a patient who is to go under the knife as important\r\nas the operation itself. My readers, unacquainted with the intricate\r\ndetails of finance and confused by the angry outcries and denials of\r\nthose I had attacked, required education _en route_ to be able to absorb\r\nand digest the hard facts and strong statements I was dealing out to\r\nthem in monthly instalments. My publishers agreed with me as to the\r\nnecessity of dealing in some radical way with the emergency, and devoted\r\nto my service additional pages in the back of _Everybody's Magazine_.\r\nHere I decided to begin a department to be called \"Lawson and His\r\nCritics\" in which I would solve the knotty problems my correspondents\r\npresented to me, set right their misunderstandings, and reply fully to\r\nthose critics who had aspersed my motives or were attempting to\r\ndiscredit my message.\r\n\r\nI began the department in October, 1904, and though I have been most\r\nseriously pressed for time, and in many instances have dealt imperfectly\r\nwith the problems treated, I must say that the task I set myself has\r\nproved interesting and agreeable, and the letters the department evoked\r\nhave been a tremendous source of inspiration and encouragement to me\r\nalong the hail-stony road I had set myself to travel.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the department during the months of 1904 was devoted to the\r\nsubject of insurance. In an early chapter of my story I said that the\r\nthree great insurance corporations, the New York Life, the Equitable,\r\nand the Mutual Life of New York, were an integral part of the \"System,\"\r\nand especially instanced the New York Life as one of the most pliable\r\ntools of the \"Made Dollar\" makers. This statement, so mild and so vague\r\nin view of subsequent developments, was the first move in the historic\r\ncontroversy that has resulted in the extraordinary exposures that are\r\nbeing made as this book goes to press. When that first pebble was\r\nthrown, the surface of the insurance pond was as placid as a mountain\r\nlake, unruffled by a ripple, and in it were reflected the benignant\r\nfaces of the noble philanthropists who consented to spend their days\r\nconserving the interests of the widows and the orphans of America. The\r\npeople had grown so accustomed to regarding the McCalls, the Perkinses,\r\nthe Hydes, the McCurdys, and the Alexanders, whose eminent physiognomies\r\nlooked out at them from their insurance policies, as lofty and generous\r\nsouls far removed from thoughts of pelf or self-aggrandizement, that my\r\nassertion caused consternation such as would occur in a Chinese temple\r\nif some rough intruder struck the idol, before whom a congregation was\r\nworshipping, with a stone. At once an avalanche of letters--protests,\r\ndemands for further facts, anxious appeals from policy-holders--poured\r\nin upon me, and frankly I took up the subject, giving my readers exactly\r\nwhat they desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE TRACTION\r\n\r\nIn order that the controversy may be unfolded in the manner in which it\r\nwas first given to the public, I give here the first letter of the\r\nseries, and then follow directly along with those passages from\r\nsucceeding numbers that are devoted to the subject:\r\n\r\n     BUFFALO, N. Y., August 25, 1904.\r\n\r\n     MR. THOMAS W. LAWSON,\r\n     Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I have been astounded beyond measure at the\r\n     revelations you make in your second article regarding the\r\n     New York Life Insurance Company, because I have two policies\r\n     in that concern which I am keeping up for the protection of\r\n     my family. My confidence in the company has been shaken by\r\n     your revelations, and I wonder if much more can be said.\r\n     Perhaps it is best for clean life insurance to tell all\r\n     now--the rest will be the better for it. Do you really\r\n     believe the officers of the company personally profited from\r\n     using the \"cash on hand\" of the company? Go on in your\r\n     exposure; you are doing a meritorious work, and we poor\r\n     devils, plodders, will never cease to thank you for your\r\n     work. Should like to have you intimate if anything more\r\n     about New York Life is coming.\r\n\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n         ---- ----\r\n\r\nTo this I replied: I desire to emphasize that the New York Life\r\nInsurance Company, which I cited, is no different from the Equitable and\r\nthe Mutual Life, or many of the other large companies. They are links in\r\nthe chain of the \"System\"--necessary links in the device by which\r\ndollars are \"made,\" by which the savings of the people are sucked from\r\nthe people to the \"System,\" the \"Private Things.\"\r\n\r\nI will, later in my story, dwell upon this tremendous phase of this\r\nstupendous question, and will only say at the present time, as an answer\r\nto such questions as \"Buffalo's\": The insurance companies use the\r\nbillions the people have placed with them to buy or create banks and\r\ntrust companies, the stocks of which are a large part of their assets.\r\nThey then use these banks and trust companies, which exist because of\r\nthe people's savings, in stock gambling enterprises, speculations as\r\nunsafe and as frenzied as those of the wildest plunger of Wall Street. I\r\nwill give one illustration:\r\n\r\nThe New York Life Insurance Company's directors and managers created the\r\nNew York Security and Trust Company. $1,000,000 capital; $500,000\r\nsurplus--in all, $1,500,000. $150 per share, of which the insurance\r\ncompany held about two-thirds. The Trust Company soon secured deposits\r\nto the extent of about $50,000,000, and these it loaned out by\r\n\"financing\" new and old enterprises. Among them was the New Hampshire\r\nTraction. The Trust Company flourished. Its stock advanced in price to\r\nover $1,300 per share, or over $13,000,000, and its different\r\nspeculative ventures prospered exceedingly. New Hampshire Traction kept\r\npace with the rest and simultaneously with them bounded upward in value\r\nuntil the amount of this stock owned by the Trust Company represented a\r\nvalue of between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000. There came a time when the\r\ndirectors of the New York Life Insurance Company decided to dispose of\r\ntheir stock in the Trust Company, and did so to a syndicate composed of\r\ntheir own members, headed by John D. Rockefeller, at $800 per share.\r\nAfterward the stock disposed of at $800 per share advanced to over\r\n$1,300, or, with the third which had not been owned by the insurance\r\ncompany but by the \"insiders\" and their friends, to a total of over\r\n$13,000,000. Then came the slump, and the price of the New Hampshire\r\nTraction fell to twenty-five cents on the dollar, and the Trust\r\nCompany's stock to less than $600.\r\n\r\nIf in all the histories of the wildcats of the wild catteries of Wall\r\nStreet a wilder case of \"frenzied finance\" can be discovered, I don't\r\nknow it, and yet this is only one of many I could quote, selected at\r\nrandom. Boiled down, it means that what was bought at $150 went to\r\n$1,400 and back to $590, and that it changed hands at $800 before it got\r\nto $1,400, and that the plunger in this transaction, which made this\r\nplunging possible, was one of the most conservative life insurance\r\ncompanies in America.\r\n\r\nI will answer \"Buffalo's\" question by asking another:\r\n\r\nSuppose all the insurance companies have been doing business on the same\r\nscale, and have tied up billions of the people's money in such schemes\r\nas New Hampshire Traction, and the people, learning these facts, should\r\ndemand their savings to the extent of the $9,000,000,000 which they have\r\ndeposited in banks and trust companies, what would happen? What would\r\nhappen to the undigested securities, the insurance companies, the\r\npeople's savings, and the policies such as \"Buffalo\" says he has\r\npurchased for the benefit of his family?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis statement precipitated a perfect flood of letters and queries,\r\ngrowing more urgent as the month wore on. It was impossible to answer\r\nall of them. I contented myself with replying to the letter of a\r\nprominent Philadelphia church-man, a policy-holder in the New York\r\nLife, who wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n     PHILADELPHIA, September 23, 1904.\r\n\r\n     MR. THOMAS W. LAWSON, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_: I have just finished reading the current\r\n     article on \"Frenzied Finance,\" and like \"Buffalo\" I am\r\n     astounded at your statements regarding the \"New York Life.\"\r\n     I, too, have a policy in that company and have been led to\r\n     believe that I was not only insured in the best and most\r\n     conservative company, but that I had a first-class and\r\n     perfectly _safe_ investment as well. This particular company\r\n     claims that not a dollar of its assets is invested in stocks\r\n     of any kind, and yet, to quote from your article:\r\n\r\n     \"The insurance companies use the billions the people have\r\n     placed with them to buy or create banks and trust companies,\r\n     the stocks of which are a large part of their assets.\"\r\n\r\n     Either you are manifestly unfair or else the company is\r\n     guilty of deliberate falsehood for the purpose of deceiving\r\n     the public.\r\n\r\n     As a policy-holder and prospective sharer in the surplus of\r\n     the \"New York Life,\" I am much interested in knowing whether\r\n     its statements in regard to its investments are to be relied\r\n     upon.\r\n\r\n     Will you take just a moment to answer the following\r\n     question? Is the \"New York Life\" telling a falsehood when it\r\n     states that not a dollar of its assets is invested in stocks\r\n     of any kind?\r\n\r\n     Very respectfully yours,\r\n         ---- ----\r\n\r\nI replied: The transaction in regard to the New York Security Company\r\nand the New Hampshire Traction stocks was exactly as I set it forth. I\r\ncan imagine no one but an absolute idiot who would dare to set it forth\r\nunless he knew he was dealing with facts.\r\n\r\nYour high position in the church should, in my opinion, peculiarly fit\r\nyou to answer fairly your question, \"Is the New York Life telling a\r\nfalsehood when it states that not a dollar of its assets is in stocks of\r\nany kind?\" when I unqualifiedly state the fact that the New York Life\r\nowned the millions of the New York Security Company's stock; that it\r\npaid $150 a share for them and sold them to a syndicate of its own\r\ndirectors at $800 per share, and that the stock afterward sold at over\r\n$1,300 per share, and still afterward dropped to less than $600 per\r\nshare. I did not wish to be unfair to the New York Life, or I should\r\nhave stated, what I shall endeavor to show before my story is ended,\r\nthat at the time the New York Life parted with these shares to their own\r\ndirectors at $800 per share they were actually worth and could have been\r\nsold for hundreds of dollars per share more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HONESTY OF THE ONE MAN\r\n\r\nAt this the big insurance companies uncovered their guns, and soon the\r\nair, the newspapers, and my mail were full of underwriting explosions.\r\nIt was necessary then to line up my forces and to go at the attack\r\nseriously. So, having carefully thought out a campaign which my\r\nknowledge of the men whom I was antagonizing taught me would bring\r\nresults, I began, in December, as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen I began to write \"Frenzied Finance\" I specifically stated that I\r\nshould not concern myself with men, but with principles. I held that to\r\nput an end to the plundering of the people required more than the\r\ndenunciation of individual criminals; that the real peril lay in the\r\nfinancial device through which the plundering was done and the \"machine\"\r\ndeveloped for their operation. The \"machine\" is the tremendous\r\ncorrelation of financial institutions and forces that I call the\r\n\"System,\" and the most potent factor in the \"System\" is the life\r\ninsurance combine--the three great insurance companies, the New York\r\nLife, Mutual Life, and Equitable, with their billion of assets and the\r\nbrimming stream of gold flowing daily into their coffers. That I should\r\nhave to discuss the relation between the \"System\" and these great\r\ninstitutions was inevitable; but, knowing how vitally interested the\r\npublic is in the preservation of the gigantic structures its savings\r\nhave erected, I had thought to treat this phase of my subject later on,\r\nwhen my readers should be absolutely convinced by what had preceded it\r\nof the honesty and fairness of my purpose. Moreover, it did not seem\r\npossible to touch on life insurance conditions without involving the men\r\nwho direct the three great companies, and whom policy-holders and the\r\npeople at large have been taught to regard as men of wellnigh miraculous\r\nsagacity, integrity, and beneficence. With these men I have had none but\r\nthe pleasantest relations, and determined as I am on the performance of\r\nmy task, I go about it with the reluctance a surgeon feels when, in\r\norder to save a friend's life, he must amputate his limb.\r\n\r\nA contingency has now arisen which compels me to depart from my rule and\r\nto discuss much more frankly than I had purposed at this juncture, the\r\nNew York Life Insurance Company, the system which controls it, and its\r\npresident, John A. McCall, the \"System's\" representative.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the inquiries of an anxious policy-holder, who had taken\r\nalarm at my statement that the funds of these great corporations were\r\nunder the control of the \"System,\" I stated in the October issue of\r\n_Everybody's Magazine_ that the New York Life was, as well as its\r\nso-called competitors, the Equitable and the Mutual, as much a\r\nparticipant in the frenzied speculation of the period as were the\r\nplunging Wall Street stock gamblers; but in giving an illustration of\r\nits methods (the New York Security and Trust Company and the New\r\nHampshire Traction Company) I selected a case which would not\r\nunnecessarily alarm nervous people, for the transaction showed an\r\nenormous profit as the result of a wild stock plunge, instead of an\r\nenormous loss--some of the New York Life's other deals were much less\r\nfortunate. When I stated that the New York Life disposed of its interest\r\nin the Security Trust Company to its directors for four millions of\r\ndollars, which represented a gain of over $3,000,000 on its original\r\ninvestment, I was careful not to state that the shares for which they\r\npaid $800 each were worth at the time $1,300 each, or $7,000,000 for\r\nwhat was sold for $4,000,000--particularly careful to state that they\r\nwere afterward worth this additional amount.\r\n\r\nPolicy-holders in the three great life-insurance companies may argue:\r\n\"The man who is known to us policy-holders as the real head of the New\r\nYork Life is John A. McCall, its president. All that you may say about\r\nthe 'System's' votaries being in control may be so, but we depend on the\r\nintegrity and the character of this one man to protect our interests. He\r\nis our representative, not the 'System's,' and our savings are surely\r\nsafe in his strong hands.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the point. In the great insurance corporations that are\r\n\"one-man run,\" the hundreds of thousands of policy-holders have but one\r\nprotection. This, notwithstanding the protection of the State laws, the\r\nguardianship of the Insurance Department of the various States, and the\r\nprovisions of the company's charter and by-laws.\r\n\r\nHowever impregnable may seem the safeguards which the law has built\r\nround the administration of our great insurance companies, the fact\r\nabsolutely is that the honesty of \"the one man\" is the one potent\r\nprotection policy-holders may depend on. The others may be juggled with\r\nas are the rules of the Stock Exchange, which say in thunder tones, \"All\r\nwithin our sacred walls is honest and honorable,\" when in reality if the\r\nmicrobes of dishonor and dishonesty generated within Stock-Exchange\r\nwalls each busy week of every year should be collected and disseminated\r\nthroughout the land, they would give typhoid of the soul to our eighty\r\nmillions of Americans. So it becomes the duty of every policy-holder to\r\nfind out by such tests as he can apply, \"Is 'the one man' who runs our\r\ncompany an honest man or is he a dishonest man?\" If \"the one man\" stands\r\ntheir tests, if he emerges from their ordeal clean, strong, honest, as\r\nthey believed, then they may rest awhile in patience. But if he is\r\nrevealed as dishonest, then it behooves the policy-holders of that\r\ncompany to take measures for the protection of their interests. The\r\nwelfare and happiness, perhaps the very lives of their mothers, their\r\nwives, and their children depend on their action.\r\n\r\nI was recently waited upon by an important man.\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, what are you doing in life insurance?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Giving facts about the life-insurance branch of a 'System' which is\r\nfoully plundering the people,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"What are you trying to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Educate the millions of life-insurance policy-holders to their present\r\nperil; after they are educated, arouse them to quick, radical action.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to cause a life-insurance blaze that will make the\r\nlife-insurance policy-holders' world so light that every scoundrel with\r\na mask, dark-lantern, and suspicious-looking bag will stand out so\r\nclearly that he cannot escape the consequences of his past deeds, nor\r\ncommit new ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you figured the consequences to yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Having no interest in what the consequences may be to myself in\r\nperforming what I have decided is a sacred duty, I have not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me show them to you. First let me ask, do you intend to confine\r\nyour criticisms to the New York Life Insurance Company?\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to bring out the facts, particularly as to the New York Life,\r\nthe Mutual Life, and the Equitable Life; and, so far as in my power\r\nlies, as to every other life-insurance company in America that is\r\nconnected with the 'System.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you actuated by any selfish motives--gain, revenge, or friendly\r\ninterest in certain life-insurance companies or banks or trust\r\ncompanies?\"\r\n\r\n\"My only interest is to perform a duty in righting a startling wrong,\r\nand I would not undertake the terrible task if I could possibly avoid\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sent to ask you these questions, to find out whether, if you are\r\nonly seeking to serve the policy-holders, and the insurance companies\r\ncan absolutely prove to you that your making public your facts will\r\ncause terrible destruction to policy-holders' interests, you will\r\nconsent to forego the life-insurance branch of your story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the facts. I have calmly, and I believe intelligently, reviewed\r\nthe effects of their being given to the world, and have concluded that\r\nthe damage to policy-holders and the people would, in any circumstances\r\nor conditions, be greater because of my not doing what I have decided to\r\ndo than by my doing it. Therefore I will not in any circumstances\r\nconsent to stop until I have laid before the world those things I\r\nconsider it should know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well and good. Let me show you what you are up against. The Equitable,\r\nthe New York Life, and Mutual Life Insurance Companies, and their\r\naffiliated institutions and individuals, are to-day by all odds the\r\ngreatest power in the world, greater by all odds than any power that\r\ncan possibly be gathered together from those outside themselves, a power\r\nso great that the effort of no man nor party of men outside themselves\r\ncan possibly prevail against their wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop where you are for a minute,\" I answered, \"and let me run over to\r\nyou what I know I am up against, and then you can judge whether I\r\nappreciate the difficulties of my task:\r\n\r\n\"First, the three companies I have named have absolute possession of\r\nproperty and money in the form of assets of over $1,000,000,000--more\r\nthan half the combined assets of all the insurance companies of\r\nAmerica--and indirectly, through their affiliated institutions, of an\r\nadditional sum, the aggregate of which is much greater than the assets\r\nof all the national banks of America and the great financial\r\ninstitutions of Europe, such as the Banks of England, France, and\r\nGermany. The three have a ready cash surplus of almost $200,000,000,\r\nwhich is greater than the combined capital of the four greatest\r\ninstitutions of Europe--the Banks of England, Russia, France, and\r\nGermany. The income of these three companies is, each year, $100,000,000\r\ngreater than the combined capitals of the Banks of England, Russia,\r\nFrance, and Germany--or about $250,000,000, $200,000,000 of which is\r\ntaken each year from their policy-holders in the form of premiums. Yet\r\nfrom out of this income there is returned to their policy-holders each\r\nyear in dividends less than $15,000,000, and in total payments of all\r\nkinds not over $100,000,000. And yet these three companies pay out each\r\nyear in what they call expenses to keep the concerns running\r\n$50,000,000, paying to the officers of the companies $3,000,000 in\r\nsalaries, almost $1,000,000 to their lawyers, and a number of millions\r\nin various forms of advertising.\r\n\r\n\"Second, the three companies are absolutely steered and controlled from\r\na common centre, and the men who do the steering and controlling are the\r\n'System's' foremost votaries, Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller,\r\nJames Stillman, and J. Pierpont Morgan through George W. Perkins, a\r\npartner in J. Pierpont Morgan & Co. Mr. Rogers, vice-president of the\r\nStandard Oil Company, is a trustee of the Mutual Life and a director in\r\none of the largest trust companies owned by the three great insurance\r\ncompanies, the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. William Rockefeller,\r\nvice-president of the Standard Oil Company, is a trustee of the Mutual\r\nLife and director in the National City--the 'Standard Oil'--Bank. James\r\nStillman is a trustee of the New York Life, and president of the\r\nNational City--the 'Standard Oil'--Bank of New York. George W. Perkins,\r\npartner of J. Pierpont Morgan & Co., is vice-president and trustee of\r\nthe New York Life and a director in the National City--the 'Standard\r\nOil'--Bank; while John A. McCall, the president of the New York Life, is\r\na director in the National City--the 'Standard Oil'--Bank.\r\n\r\n\"These great institutions own a majority of the capital stock or have\r\nabsolute control of a number of the leading banks and trust companies of\r\nNew York and elsewhere; and such ownership shows conclusively the\r\nlinking together of the three great insurance companies. For instance,\r\nthe Equitable owns more than a majority of the stock of the Mercantile\r\nTrust Company of New York, of a book value of about $4,500,000 and a\r\nmarket value of almost $13,000,000; and of the Equitable Trust of New\r\nYork, of a book value of $5,500,000 and a market value of $9,000,000;\r\nand of the Bank of Commerce of New York, of a book value of about\r\n$8,000,000 and a market value of over $9,000,000; and in the directory\r\nof the Mercantile Trust of New York and Equitable Trust is E. H.\r\nHarriman, one of the leading 'Standard Oil' men and one of the active\r\nvotaries of the 'System,' while in the directory of the Bank of Commerce\r\nare the president of the Mutual Life and seven other trustees of the\r\nMutual Life and three of the trustees of the New York Life.\r\n\r\n\"The Mutual Life owns stock of the Bank of Commerce, of a book value of\r\n$4,500,000 and a market value of $7,500,000; of the United States\r\nMortgage & Trust Company, of a book value of $2,000,000 and a market\r\nvalue of $4,500,000; and of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, of a\r\nbook value of $1,250,000 and a market value of $5,500,000. The directors\r\nof the United States Mortgage & Trust Company consist of eight trustees\r\nof the Mutual Life, including its president, and two trustees of the\r\nEquitable Life, while in the Guaranty Trust directory is the president\r\nof the Mutual Life, Henry H. Rogers, and E. H. Harriman, 'Standard Oil'\r\nvotary and director in the Equitable.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to these financial institutions, the Mutual Life has about\r\n$20,000,000 of its funds invested in the stock of twenty-five other\r\ntrust companies and national banks, while the Equitable has about\r\n$10,000,000 invested in some fifteen other trust and banking\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\"Third, the absolute control of the three great companies, and through\r\nthem of their subsidiary financial institutions, while supposed to be in\r\nthe hands of the policy-holders, is entirely beyond their regulation, as\r\nall policy-holders of the three companies give over complete control of\r\ntheir companies to the 'System' through the following machinery: The\r\ncontrol of the New York Life rests absolutely in President McCall, that\r\nof the Mutual Life with President McCurdy. Originally these men were\r\nelected to office by policy-holders' proxies, voted by the great general\r\nagents; but so immeasurable has been the growth of these corporations\r\nthat only rebellion among policy-holders on an international scale could\r\noust from power the McCalls and the McCurdys. The control of the\r\nEquitable Life rests in the $100,000 of capital stock which is almost\r\nentirely owned by the men who elect themselves to manage the company.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore you will see that I fully comprehend that this power, which\r\nyou claim to be, and which undoubtedly is, the greatest on earth, is\r\nabsolutely, for all practical purposes, in the hands of three men, and\r\nthat any one who attempts to do anything contrary to what this power\r\nallows will find himself opposed by practically unlimited money, which\r\ncan be used first to corrupt all sources of help, including State\r\ninsurance-law enforcers, and then to keep such corruptions from the\r\npolicy-holders by subsidizing the press. In other words, you see that I\r\nfully comprehend that I, or any man or any body of men, would be\r\nabsolutely helpless in an attempt to correct present evils unless we\r\ncould do two things: First, show to the policy-holders of the great\r\ninsurance companies that they are absolutely in the hands and at the\r\nmercy of 'one man,' and next, that this 'one man' is unscrupulous.\"\r\n\r\nIn other and different ways I had it forcibly impressed upon me that I\r\nmust go no further in connecting the life-insurance companies with\r\n\"frenzied financiering\"; that while the \"Standard Oil\"-Amalgamated-City\r\nBank crowd might bide their time for reprisal and vengeance, the great\r\ninsurance companies must at any cost instantly squelch those rash souls\r\nwho dared to cross their paths. To all such warnings I replied that a\r\nlife-insurance company, especially great institutions with hundreds of\r\nthousands of policy-holders, must be as far above suspicion as Cæsar's\r\nwife; that the security of the immense funds in their possession must be\r\nas unassailable as the United States Constitution; but that immunity\r\nfrom criticism could be secured only by honesty of purpose, honesty of\r\nmethod, and honesty of results; and that I would follow \"frenzied\r\nfinance\" wherever it might lead, even if the exposure brought every\r\nlife-insurance concern in the country down to the ring-bolt of making\r\npublic confession of complicity. But with all my knowledge of the\r\n\"System's\" weakness, I never dreamed of the condition of fatuity into\r\nwhich the past few years of unbridled \"frenzied finance\" have plunged\r\nits votaries. If the correspondence that follows here correctly\r\nrepresents the purposes and the methods of great American life-insurance\r\ncompanies, I ask my readers what quick, sharp, effective means should be\r\ntaken to call a halt and rescue the billions of the people's savings\r\nbefore it is too late. And I ask all policy-holders in the great\r\ninsurance companies to weigh carefully what follows, that from it they\r\nmay decide the question.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became fixed in the minds of the different interested\r\nparties who had communicated with me that my purpose was unalterable,\r\nqueer things happened:\r\n\r\nFirst, there appeared in the press of the country, under large, black\r\nheadlines, the startling confession of the editor of a New York\r\nfinancial paper, who, conscience-stricken, admitted that he had been\r\nengaged in the systematic blackmail of insurance companies and officials\r\nand Wall Street institutions such as banks and trust companies. It was\r\na curious document, and even the casual reader must have wondered at the\r\nmysterious lack of detail. The paper, I found out later, was one of the\r\ninnumerable swarm of journalistic insects generated, like mosquitoes, in\r\nthe financial swamps of Wall Street, destined to live a day and die as\r\nthey deliver their sting, and the attention given it was curiously out\r\nof proportion to its importance. Among other queer things, the editor\r\nannounced that after printing his confession he would disappear; no\r\nnames were mentioned nor a fact printed which identified any one or\r\nanything. All this could not happen without a motive, and I said to\r\nmyself, \"The 'System' is planting a mine for some one.\" Not another word\r\nappeared. I awaited developments. On October 8th I received the\r\nfollowing letters, which tell their own story:\r\n\r\n     FREMONT, OHIO, October 6, 1904.\r\n\r\n     MR. THOMAS W. LAWSON, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_: I have followed with intensest interest your\r\n     discussion of \"Frenzied Finance.\" The _exposé_ of the\r\n     \"System,\" and its Machiavellian performances, was highly\r\n     interesting to me. I was associated with Attorney-General\r\n     Monnett in his effort to get testimony and the inside facts\r\n     concerning the trust and its operations in his prosecution\r\n     against that corporation for violating the Ohio anti-trust\r\n     law. At that time the books of the company were burned in\r\n     Cleveland, and, as stated in your article, the company now\r\n     relies upon the superior memory of Standard Oil.\r\n\r\n     I was well aware of the connection of certain life-insurance\r\n     companies with Morgan and the Rockefellers, but until your\r\n     public charge, was not familiar with the details. As I had\r\n     considerable money invested myself in New York Life\r\n     Insurance I wrote John A. McCall a bitter letter. In this\r\n     age of commercialism sentimental benevolence gets little\r\n     place. The common sentiments of humanity and appreciation of\r\n     responsibility admonish one in moderate circumstances or\r\n     even in affluence to invite the co-operation of others in\r\n     providing for those dependent upon the individual hazard of\r\n     life and fortune. Life insurance has come to be a sacred\r\n     thing. It is the substantial token and expression of\r\n     responsibility which a reasonable man dying leaves to those\r\n     dependent upon him. I so wrote Mr. McCall, and told him that\r\n     if the head of a great institution like the New York Life\r\n     Insurance Company would be guilty of such perfidy as charged\r\n     by you, the organization which would retain him in a\r\n     position of responsibility was undeserving of confidence or\r\n     patronage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF JOHN A. MCCALL'S REPLY TO H. C. DERAN, THE\r\nPOLICYHOLDER WHO HAD ASKED FOR A DENIAL OF MR. LAWSON'S CHARGES.]\r\n\r\n     I enclose for your inspection Mr. McCall's reply. This is\r\n     doubtless a sample of the sort of campaign waged throughout\r\n     the country by the \"System.\"\r\n\r\n     I enclose stamped envelope for the return of the McCall\r\n     letter, as I purpose continuing the correspondence until I\r\n     force him to an issue.\r\n\r\n     You will observe the very palpable evasion of the issue. I\r\n     asked him if the details of the transaction described in\r\n     _Everybody's_, in which the New York Life Insurance figured\r\n     conspicuously, were true. He answered by saying that he made\r\n     money out of the trust company venture and retired. The fact\r\n     that New York Life money is so deposited as to suit the\r\n     convenience of the \"System\" in its heads--I win, tails--you\r\n     lose, operation, is a matter which has escaped the attention\r\n     of the astute financier. I have written him further, calling\r\n     his attention to the fact that his letter conveys no\r\n     information not heretofore made public in circular but that\r\n     my inquiry was directed to the particular transaction\r\n     alluded to in _Everybody's_, and requesting a flat\r\n     affirmation or denial.\r\n\r\n     Trusting that these facts may be of assistance to you, I am,\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n         (Signed) H. C. DERAN.\r\n\r\nI shall spare my readers the enclosures. They were newspaper slips,\r\nprinted on fairly thick paper, reproduced from unknown publications, and\r\nobviously put forth to discredit me by implication. One, headed \"A\r\nFrenzied Financial Blackmailer,\" from the _Vigilant_, New York City,\r\nSeptember 30, 1904, presented the confession, previously referred to,\r\nmade by the editor of the _United States Investors' Guardian_, and an\r\neditorial denouncing the blackmail of financial corporations. Another\r\nslip was \"Stamp out the Fake Financial Newspaper Publisher\" from the\r\n_Fourth Estate_, New York City, October 1, 1904, in which the wickedness\r\nof the aforesaid editor came in for further moral castigation.\r\n\r\nAt once, as I read these letters and ran over the printed slips pinned\r\nto Mr. McCall's, I realized the purpose of the blackmail editor's\r\nconfession and just how so much space came to be given it in the daily\r\npapers. Insurance corporations are large advertisers[20] and enjoy great\r\npopularity in the business offices of great newspapers. It is not said\r\nin these clippings that either Mr. Lawson or _Everybody's Magazine_\r\nbelongs to that lowest order of criminal, the self-confessed\r\nblack-mailer, but the suggestion is obvious. Every policy-holder\r\nthroughout the world who received these enclosures attached to letters\r\nfrom the greatest insurance president in America would instantly supply\r\nthe connection--\"'Frenzied finance black-mailer'--that's intended for\r\nLawson, surely; 'Frenzied financial journal'--_Everybody's Magazine_,\r\nbeyond question.\"\r\n\r\nWill my readers weigh carefully this awful charge:\r\n\r\n\"Thomas W. Lawson, in addition to being a frenzied financial\r\nblack-mailer, is attacking the New York Life Insurance Company because\r\nhe tried to secure insurance from that company, and that company would\r\nnot give it to him. His attack is made in the interest of some competing\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, I ask that it be kept in mind that all this is not said by an\r\ninsignificant and irresponsible trickster, but is deliberately put forth\r\nby the greatest insurance president in America, over his signature, to\r\nhis policy-holder No. 826,152 and 957,006.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, in its issue of October 20th, a well-known organ of the\r\ninsurance companies, _The Spectator_, published in New York, had a long\r\narticle dealing with malicious attacks on our great insurance\r\ncorporations, specifically mentioning my accusation against the New York\r\nLife. \"Mr. Lawson was actuated by the meanest motives,\" says _The\r\nSpectator_.\r\n\r\nExtract from _The Spectator_, October 20, 1904:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson, in the hypocritical rôle of a\r\n     would-be-reformed-speculator, is a figure calculated to stir\r\n     the risibilities of all who have watched his antics and read\r\n     his articles, _especially when each one of the companies he\r\n     mentions has repeatedly rejected him for insurance_.\r\n\r\nLetters to policy-holders from the New York Life Insurance officers\r\npoured in on me from different parts of the country, all containing the\r\nsame defence and the same accusations as the one above, and signed by\r\nvice-presidents of the company as well as President McCall, showing\r\nconclusively that this great corporation as a corporation had\r\ndeliberately adopted this method of meeting my serious yet\r\nconservatively put business accusations.\r\n\r\nPresident McCall's defence of the New York Life Insurance Company and\r\nhis reply to my accusations are now completely before my readers. Let us\r\nsee if there is not a chance here to determine the grave question, \"Is\r\n'_the one man_' who runs each of our great insurance companies honest?\"\r\n\r\nThe facts are: During the past twenty years I have been importuned,\r\nbegged, and hounded by the several great insurance companies of the\r\nUnited States to take out policies with them almost upon any terms I\r\nmight name. Of this statement I could present more photographic proof\r\nthan would fit in any one issue of this magazine, but most of it would\r\nhave no bearing on the point at issue.\r\n\r\nIn the present year (1904)--to go no further back--John A. McCall has\r\nrepeatedly urged me to come into the New York Life Insurance Company.\r\nAbsolute evidence of the truth of this assertion is presented below. Mr.\r\nMcCall's letter reproduced here would be accepted as complete proof in\r\nany court of justice. In the correspondence that follows this first\r\nletter it will be seen that Mr. McCall left no stone unturned in his\r\neffort to get me into the New York Life Insurance Company. A duplicate\r\nof the communication sent to my residence went on the same date to my\r\noffice. To quote his own words, \"I hope you may\" and \"I may have the\r\npleasure of welcoming you either to new or increased membership in this\r\ngreat mutual insurance investment.\" Then, his anxiety being so great,\r\nafter waiting four days for a reply he sent his special agent to argue\r\nwith me, and, on the following day, his Boston manager to urge me\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF LETTER FROM JOHN A. MCCALL SOLICITING\r\nINSURANCE, SENT TO MR. LAWSON'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF HEADING AND SIGNATURE OF JOHN A. MCCALL'S\r\nLETTER OF JANUARY 22D, SENT IN DUPLICATE TO MR. LAWSON'S OFFICE; OF\r\nSPECIAL AGENT GILLESPIE'S LETTER OF JANUARY 27TH; OF MANAGER HAYES'S\r\nLETTER OF JANUARY 28TH. THESE THREE LETTERS SOLICITING INSURANCE,\r\nFOLLOWED EACH OTHER WITHIN A PERIOD OF SIX DAYS.]\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that I called the history I am writing \"Frenzied\r\nFinance\"? The man who wrote the letter practically saying that I was a\r\nblack-mailer and that my reason for attacking the New York Life was my\r\nanger because he would not take me into his company, and the man who\r\nwrote the ones begging me to come in, are one and the same; and he\r\nabsolutely controls directly $400,000,000 of the people's savings in\r\nthe New York Life, and indirectly unnumbered millions in affiliated\r\ninstitutions!\r\n\r\nI think the case is complete. The policy-holders of the New York Life\r\nhave an opportunity to decide whether the \"one man\" who runs the great\r\ninstitution in which their savings are invested is honest. In making up\r\ntheir minds, I implore them not at the present time, or at least until\r\nthe question has been more fully ventilated, to allow their policies to\r\nlapse. Under any and all circumstances they should keep up the payment\r\nof their premiums, for the one thing especially desired and schemed for\r\nby some of the \"frenzied finance\" insurance companies is a wholesale\r\nlapse of policies.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago the financial world learned with great interest of a\r\nnew and very useful invention in finance. A group of individuals who had\r\nbeen buying large quantities of a certain stock at a low price, found\r\nthey could not, on account of the fact of its overcapitalization having\r\nbecome known to the public, resell it; and they were, to use the\r\nstock-gambling term, \"hung up\" with it because it was too water-logged\r\nto float. It became necessary to disguise its identity. Here's how they\r\ndid it: They formed a \"syndicate,\" to which they \"turned over\" their\r\nstock at a good profit; the \"syndicate\" in its turn put it \"in trust\" by\r\nsimply depositing the stock certificate with a trust company, which in\r\nits turn issued against the stocks thus held a new security, which it\r\ncalled a \"bond.\" For these a ready market was found, for the word \"bond\"\r\nis still a term to conjure with in the world of finance.\r\n\r\nThis seemed such a serviceable arrangement that the originators soon had\r\nmany imitators. Many \"syndicates\" were formed, and many so-called\r\n\"bonds\" were put on the market. In most cases the stocks were purchased\r\nat a low price, turned into \"trusts\" at double their cost, and then paid\r\nfor by means of these certificates, dubbed \"bonds.\" As one stock after\r\nanother was converted into syndicate certificates--\"bonds\"--the\r\nfamiliarity of the procedure robbed it of its novelty and these \"bonds\"\r\nwere quoted and dealt in much as other and more tangible securities\r\nbearing the same name. Perhaps this is why the startling announcement of\r\nthe New York Life Insurance Company made about this time, that it\r\nproposed to sell all its stocks and thereafter hold nothing but bonds,\r\ncreated so much less of a sensation than was anticipated. The term\r\n\"bond\" had become vulgarized.\r\n\r\nThis excellent example would undoubtedly have had many followers but for\r\nthe humor of the Tobacco Trust. This robust institution, with an immense\r\namount of watered stock, audaciously poured it all but a small amount\r\ninto bonds, $157,000,000 of them, and with a fine trumpet-blast\r\nproclaimed these \"bonds\" safe investments for widows, orphans, and\r\ninsurance companies. Even Wall Street, with its frenzied votaries and\r\nits frenzied environment, was staggered. The culmination of these\r\nconversion performances was the brilliant plan evolved by George W.\r\nPerkins, the junior partner in the firm of J. Pierpont Morgan & Co.,\r\nvice-president of the New York Life Insurance Company and expert\r\ninvestor of its vast surplus, to have the United States Steel Trust\r\npurchase some $200,000,000 worth of its own water-logged stock and\r\nconvert the same into more \"absolutely safe bonds\"; for its most\r\nvaluable services in the turning-over process the Morgan firm was to\r\nhave a commission of some forty millions of dollars. At this juncture\r\n\"frenzied finance\" became gagged with its own froth, and I have not\r\nspace here to go further into the subject.\r\n\r\nThe New York Life Insurance Company declares to its agents,\r\npolicy-holders, and prospective policy-holders that it no longer holds\r\nstock securities. In its last report to the Insurance Commissioners\r\nthere are set forth stock securities of the kind I have described above,\r\nto the amount of fifty millions of dollars. I will give one\r\nillustration:\r\n\r\n\"Northern Pacific--Great Northern--C., B. & Q. collateral 4s, book\r\nvalue--$12,057,132.59, market value--$11,375,000.\"--(From the official\r\nreport to Insurance Commissioners.)\r\n\r\nNow, these bonds are nothing more nor less than Chicago, Burlington and\r\nQuincy stock of a par value of $100 per share, which shares were\r\npurchased by individuals, and had \"bonds\" issued against them at $200\r\nper share. (Northern Pacific and Great Northern stock in about the same\r\nproportion.) In the sense in which the public look upon the old bonds of\r\nrailroads this \"bond\" is no more a bond than it is a Government bond. It\r\nis nothing more nor less than a stock security, _and yet President\r\nMcCall says in his letter printed above and sent by him to\r\npolicy-holder DeRan that the New York Life does not and cannot invest\r\nits surplus in stock securities_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE STORY OF HOW I WAS \"BLACK-LISTED\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of President McCall's letter and the charges which\r\naccompanied it attracted so much attention that the \"Big Three\" were\r\nflooded with letters from policy-holders demanding information. In the\r\nJanuary, 1904, issue of _Everybody's Magazine_, I continued the\r\ncontroversy. After reviewing the conditions of the previous month's\r\nargument, I went on:\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the exposure of the most powerful body of men in the\r\nworld, I knew quite well what I was \"up against,\" and deliberately\r\ndecided that in the conduct of my fight I would use such strategy as I\r\nbelieved proper to outwit so strong and so unscrupulous an adversary.\r\nOne can hang a dog as well with a cord as with a hawser, and in proving\r\nmy assertions I am quite willing that the insurance companies should\r\nbelieve each play is my best card. I decline, however, to show my hand.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the charge that I was attacking the New York Life because I\r\nhad been refused insurance by that company, as positively stated in Mr.\r\nMcCall's letter, I reproduced a letter written and signed by President\r\nJohn A. McCall, dated 1904, soliciting me to take out insurance in his\r\ncompany. I printed parts of three other letters, one directed to my\r\noffice, also signed by Mr. McCall, another from the special agent, and a\r\nthird from the Boston agent of the New York Life, supplementing Mr.\r\nMcCall's letter and requesting the privilege of an interview.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence was put forth with a thorough understanding of its\r\nnature. The publishers of _Everybody's Magazine_ and my own lawyers, to\r\nwhom I submitted it, both pointed out that the insurance companies would\r\nundoubtedly take the ground that the McCall letter was no more than a\r\ncircular that had been sent out to a number of capitalists and had gone\r\nto me by mistake. I replied that such a rejoinder would practically\r\namount to an admission that the statement and signature of the highest\r\nofficials of the New York Life were valueless and without significance,\r\nwhich would place President McCall in an untenable position. If his\r\nsignature were valueless and without significance when appended to a\r\nletter addressed to me, why not in other instances if the interests of\r\nhis corporation seemed to require such a disclaimer? Considering my\r\nargument, would not such a confession have a pregnant bearing on the\r\nproposition--is the \"one man\" honest, especially as I was equipped with\r\nadditional documents to offset further attempts on the part of the\r\ninsurance companies to show me up as a disappointed seeker after their\r\npolicies?\r\n\r\nHere, specifically, are the details of my encounter with the\r\nlife-insurance institutions, and I pledge my word to my readers that\r\nthey constitute all the facts in this connection. They are well known to\r\nthe prominent men associated with the great companies whose duty it is\r\nto keep track of just such transactions. Whoever knows by experience of\r\nthe incessant pursuit of business by the important insurance\r\ncorporations need not be told that a man in my position has had his\r\nshare of importuning by agents great and small. I have never sought life\r\ninsurance, for it has not appealed to me as an investment, but on three\r\nseparate occasions I have yielded to the persuasions of a friend\r\nconnected with one of the big institutions and have considered the\r\nsubject. The first time was in 1887, following a breakdown from\r\noverwork. This illness my friend used as an argument to induce me to\r\ntake out insurance, and I went so far as to agree to submit to a private\r\nmedical examination by the leading physicians of his company for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining if my breakdown, which for a brief time had left\r\na trace of paralysis in my left side, would bar me. This examination was\r\nat my own expense, and it was expressly understood that, being private,\r\nit should not constitute a record. The physician pronounced me a perfect\r\nrisk, but advised against going further inasmuch as a rigid rule of the\r\ncompany precluded them from granting insurance to any one who had\r\nsuffered from this form of illness until seven years after the attack.\r\nI was not disappointed except on account of my friend.\r\n\r\nFive years later his solicitation was renewed and I was assured that the\r\nofficials of his company were so eager to have me that they would waive\r\nthe seven-year rule, which still had two years to run. This time I went\r\nup before another medical examiner, and after the usual tests, was asked\r\nthe stereotyped question if I had ever previously been rejected for life\r\ninsurance. My friend replied for me--no. I, however, in spite of his\r\nprotests stated fully the conditions of my previous examination, which\r\nthe doctor assured me did not constitute an official rejection, and the\r\napplication was filled out. In the conversation that ensued, the doctor\r\nsaid that it was safer to await the expiration of the seven years, and I\r\nbeing still indifferent, except to my friend's interest, accepted the\r\napologies of the several people concerned for the trouble I had taken\r\nand let it go at that.\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1896, after the attack of appendicitis which I\r\ndescribed in the December, 1904, instalment of \"Frenzied Finance,\" again\r\nmy good friend the agent came to me and used the incident of my narrow\r\nescape from death to impress upon me once more the desirability of\r\nhaving a large policy of life insurance. Those who have read the\r\n\"System's\" disclaimer, will remember that I had been blacklisted since\r\n1892. There were the usual consultations with high officials of the\r\ncorporation, and when all preliminary bargains had been arranged, I\r\nunderwent a thorough examination in New York. This time, the seven-year\r\nterm having expired, I was pronounced a perfect risk. But my latest\r\nillness had brought me up against another waiting rule, and once more\r\nthe subject was abandoned after the usual expressions of regret and\r\ngood-will. Since 1896 my connection with life-insurance companies has\r\nbeen about the same as that of a molasses barrel with the industrious\r\nflies in summer.\r\n\r\nThe interviews of 1892 and 1896 are both matters of record. My position\r\nin each instance was well understood, and several insurance officials\r\nwho know the facts as well as I do have, since the publication of the\r\ncompany's statement, come to me and offered to back up my assertions\r\nwith their own. American manhood is certainly not extinct when men are\r\nwilling to sacrifice their careers to set a wrong right.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the great companies have met my rejoinder to\r\nPresident McCall will afford my readers an excellent illustration of how\r\nthe \"System\" goes after a man who has excited its antagonism.\r\n\r\nA few days after the publication of the December issue of _Everybody's\r\nMagazine_, containing my fac-simile of President McCall's letter to\r\npolicy-holder DeRan and his two letters to me, the Life Insurance\r\nUnderwriters met and \"resoluted\" that I had applied for insurance in the\r\nNew York Life Insurance Company in 1892, and being asked if I had ever\r\nbeen refused insurance, had replied in the negative. Investigation\r\nshowed that I had been refused four years before by two other companies,\r\nwhereupon my application was rejected and I was practically\r\nblack-listed, and so could not secure life insurance in any American\r\ncompany. By way of corroborating this plausible story two letters,\r\npurporting to have been written by agents of the two companies to their\r\nhead officers without my knowledge, were incorporated in the resolution.\r\nThe letters stated that the writers could secure me for a large amount\r\nof insurance if the companies would accept the risk. The virtuous\r\ncorporations were alleged to have replied that Mr. Lawson had been\r\nrefused life insurance before, and for good reasons was not desired as a\r\nrisk. This resolution was then published throughout the press of America\r\nin the news columns, and to all but those initiated in the desperate\r\npractices of the \"System\" and its votaries, it was conclusive evidence\r\nthat an unprincipled man had been convicted, red-handed, of fraud.\r\n\r\nYou who read this statement of mine doubtless found the resolutions in\r\nyour own paper, and thought it ordinary news-matter printed because of\r\nits public interest. This notice was an advertisement disguised as news,\r\nand inserted through the \"System's\" professional character assassinator,\r\nwhose head-quarters are in Boston, a person who will occupy a prominent\r\npart in the chapters of my story wherein I treat of the crimes of\r\nAmalgamated. The publication cost the insurance companies $2.50 per\r\nline of the policy-holders' money, while advertisements that I insert in\r\nthe course of my private business cost me but 75 cents per line.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE \"SYSTEM\" MAKES ITS PROFITS\r\n\r\nIt appeared that I had sinned still further, for had I not questioned\r\nthe virtue and integrity of the New York Life's securities? To\r\npolicy-holder DeRan, Mr. McCall had stated, over his own signature, that\r\nthe New York Life did not and could not own stock securities. (See the\r\nDeRan letter on page 428.) I proved from the regular insurance reports\r\nthat millions of the New York Life's bonds were no more than disguised\r\nstock securities, created by the new device of depositing stocks with a\r\ntrust company at an inflated price and issuing against them a receipt\r\nwhich is arbitrarily called a \"bond.\" I mentioned, as an illustration,\r\nthe Northern Pacific-Great Northern-C., B. & Q. Collateral 4s, created\r\nout of the stock of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy and other\r\nrailroads. I could have selected a much worse type of security, just as,\r\ninstead of the typewritten letter of Mr. McCall, I might have published\r\nothers of a more personal nature.\r\n\r\nAgainst me out sallied 2d Vice-President Perkins, brother of George W.\r\nPerkins, 1st Vice-President of the New York Life (J. Pierpont Morgan's\r\npartner), and at a banquet in Philadelphia boldly answered my aspersions\r\nby declaring that the bonds I named \"are printed in the list of holdings\r\nwhich the company publishes in detail, and has published for the last\r\nfive years, in order that its policy-holders may be informed of its\r\naffairs in the minutest detail.\" The convincing logic of this rejoinder\r\nthe dullest will appreciate, but for a moment I must stop to remind Mr.\r\nPerkins that the publicity on which he plumes himself is really not an\r\nexpression of the New York Life's individual frankness, but merely an\r\nobservance compelled by the law.\r\n\r\nAll this recapitulation has been for a purpose. My readers will bear in\r\nmind before taking hold of my next exhibit that the great insurance\r\ncompanies have published me as a falsifier, who since 1892 has been\r\nrefused insurance and black-listed for good reasons, and have claimed\r\nthat Mr. McCall's letters were circulars sent me by mistake. We are\r\nstill considering the problem--_are the men who run our great insurance\r\ncompanies honest?_ Well, look at the reproduction on page 442 of a\r\ndocument that is now in my possession and has always been since the date\r\nwhen it was delivered to me by one of the three great representatives of\r\nthe \"System,\" the Equitable Life Insurance Company.\r\n\r\nThis document speaks for itself. My readers are aware of the\r\nnegotiations and investigations which precede the making of an insurance\r\ncontract. To them and to the \"System's\" votaries I recommend the exhibit\r\nand the underwriters' resolutions as a simple lesson in frenzied\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nMy charge that the directors of the great life-insurance corporations of\r\nAmerica use the funds of the companies they control in stock speculation\r\nfor their personal benefit is but one contention in my argument against\r\nthe character of their management. Here I formally add another charge:\r\nIt is that in the placing of loans, in the purchase of properties and\r\nsecurities, and in the underwriting of enterprises, there are enormous\r\nprofits made, directly and indirectly, which are pocketed by individuals\r\nand are never shown on the books of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe basis of life insurance is security. A policy-holder pays his\r\npremium to enable the corporation accepting it to make good its contract\r\nwith him when death or time matures it. The vast sums in the possession\r\nof the three great companies are accumulated to safeguard their\r\npolicy-holders, and should be invested only in securities of tried and\r\nsolid worth, which will bring in no more nor less than the going rate of\r\ninterest. There must be no experiments and, above all, no speculation.\r\nBut what do we find? The positions of managers and manipulators of these\r\nhuge hoards of the people's money have become the greatest financial\r\nprizes of the day. New and ingenious methods of graft have been devised\r\nin connection with them. The vast revenues of the insurance companies\r\nhave become the \"System's\" most potent instrument in working its will in\r\nthe stock world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTheir investments, largely in the securities of properties or\r\ncorporations in which the \"System's\" votaries have large interests, are\r\nfertile sources of profit to the \"insiders.\" The groups of banks and\r\ntrust companies affiliated with them are the medium through which access\r\nto the coveted insurance funds is obtained, for these institutions are\r\nallowed by law to use money for speculative purposes, which the\r\ninsurance concerns are prohibited from doing.\r\n\r\nThe immense opportunities for profit afforded by the control of these\r\ngreat money hoards are taken advantage of in various ways. Let me\r\nillustrate one or two of them. Rogers, Rockefeller, Stillman, and Morgan\r\nbuy the capital stock of three railways at a fair valuation, say,\r\n$20,000,000 apiece, $60,000,000 for the three. Owning all, or nearly\r\nall, the stock, they can put its price on the stock-exchanges to any\r\nfigure they desire, say, $60,000,000 for each railway, or $180,000,000\r\nin all. They proceed to deposit the stocks of the three roads in a trust\r\ncompany, issuing against them $180,000,000 of what they call \"bonds.\" An\r\n\"underwriting\" syndicate is then organized. This is composed of certain\r\nindividuals and corporations who agree that when these bonds are offered\r\nto the public at $180,000,000, the portion the public does not buy, they\r\n(the \"underwriters\") will purchase on the basis of $120,000,000; in\r\nother words, they guarantee the sale of the bonds at $180,000,000. In\r\nreturn they \"make\" on all the bonds sold the difference between the\r\nprice to them, $120,000,000, and the price the public pays,\r\n$180,000,000. Let us assume that the public takes up the issue greedily\r\nand the full price, $180,000,000, has been secured. The original owners,\r\nRogers, Rockefeller, etc., have made $60,000,000, the difference between\r\nthe first cost and $120,000,000, the cost to the \"underwriters,\" while\r\nthe \"underwriters\" have made $60,000,000, the difference between\r\n$120,000,000 and the $180,000,000, the cost to the people. In looking\r\nover the list of subscribers to these bonds, you will note that the\r\nlargest purchases have been made for the great insurance corporations\r\nand the banks and trust companies owned or controlled by them and \"The\r\nSystem.\" If, in the instance I am using for illustration, a president\r\nor vice-president of one of the great insurance companies is known to be\r\nwilling to subscribe for, say, $10,000,000 for his insurance company;\r\n$5,000,000 for his principal trust company, which is owned by the\r\ninsurance company; $1,000,000 apiece for five other banks and trust\r\ncompanies, also owned or controlled by the insurance company; and can\r\ninfluence five other affiliated institutions to subscribe for $1,000,000\r\napiece, he controls, as will readily be seen, a purchasing power of\r\n$25,000,000, and is sought for as an underwriter, if he is not already\r\nan owner. For this $25,000,000 which his institutions buy he \"draws\r\ndown,\" as his personal profit, 33-1/3 per cent. \"underwriters'\"\r\ncommission, or over eight millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nIn taking this amount, he is not _robbing_ his insurance company, in the\r\ncommon acceptance of the term in this era of \"frenzied finance,\" though\r\nhe has absolutely appropriated to himself a profit which belongs to it\r\nand not to him.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that such transactions as this I have outlined\r\nare conducted in the simple ABC fashion I have set down here for purpose\r\nof illustration. No \"one man\" appears through any deal. The purchases\r\nand sales are usually made through dummies, and the final recipient of\r\nthe \"made millions\" carefully conceals all the phases of his\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\nLet us take another type of transaction. An insurance company owns two\r\nadjoining pieces of unimproved city real estate, for which it paid\r\n$250,000 apiece, but which are now worth $500,000 each. The directors of\r\nthe corporation formally decide to dispose of these holdings, and sell\r\nthe first piece to a trust company, which is owned or controlled by the\r\ninsurance company. One of the \"System's\" dummies or an officer or\r\ndirector of the corporation agrees to take the other at the same price.\r\nThis is a perfectly legitimate transaction, and the insurance company\r\nshows a half-million profit on its investment. The next step is this. On\r\nits piece the trust company erects a two-million-dollar building,\r\nprocuring the money from the insurance company at a low rate of\r\ninterest. Thereupon the value of the adjoining piece bought by the\r\n\"System's\" votary jumps fifty per cent., so he has made $250,000\r\nwithout risking a dollar. At the same time there have been several other\r\nprofitable transactions between institutions and individuals. The agent\r\nwho disposed of the two pieces of real estate and who is \"in\" the\r\ntransaction receives a generous commission for making the sales; the\r\ntrust company's representative has his own \"draw-down,\" and there are\r\nfurther commissions to the agents who borrow and loan the money and\r\ncontrol the erection of the building.\r\n\r\nMy readers may well ask, Are these merely illustrations, or do such\r\nthings really take place? I unqualifiedly reply that deals similar to\r\nthese have occurred repeatedly and that the principle and procedure set\r\nforth are the rule and not exceptional. Here is a minor episode of which\r\nI have personal knowledge. A well-known man made direct application to\r\nthe Mutual Life Insurance Company for a loan of $400,000 on a valuable\r\ncity business block which he owned. He was told that the corporation had\r\nno funds available for that purpose. The refusal was authoritative and\r\ndefinite. A few days later a lawyer and real-estate agent came to his\r\noffice and said to him: \"I'm informed that you want $400,000 on your\r\nproperty. I can let you have it, or $500,000 if you need that much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said the would-be borrower, \"I will take it. Whose money is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mutual's.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" said the would-be borrower, \"how can that be? I was\r\nthere at the office a few days ago and was assured I could not have the\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" was the answer. \"Of course you could not get the\r\nmoney. The right party did not see the right party. D'ye understand?\"\r\n\r\nHe understood.\r\n\r\nA recent issue of the _Insurance Register_, of Philadelphia, in\r\ncriticizing my comments on President McCall and life insurance, makes\r\nthe following significant admissions in regard to the conduct of these\r\ngreat corporations:\r\n\r\n     While riding on the train on my way to my office this\r\n     morning a lawyer told me the following story: A client of\r\n     his, a real-estate agent, represented a corporation owning\r\n     and wishing to sell a valuable Chestnut Street property.\r\n     The price asked was $750,000. A representative of a New York\r\n     corporation called upon him and agreed to take the property,\r\n     but stipulated that the price named in the deed and\r\n     receipted for should be $850,000, the difference covering\r\n     his commission of $100,000. The Philadelphian, finding it\r\n     impossible to induce his clients to make this concession,\r\n     and the New York agent insisting upon it as indispensable to\r\n     the purchase, made a trip to New York to see the principal,\r\n     acquaint it with the facts, and find out whether or not some\r\n     arrangement could be made by which the buyer could take care\r\n     of its agent's commission. He was received by the manager of\r\n     the New York corporation, but when he stated that he\r\n     represented the owner of the Philadelphia property he was\r\n     instantly bowed out of the office, with the assurance: \"We\r\n     never interfere with business in the hands of our agent.\"\r\n     The outcome was that the sale was not consummated, because\r\n     the officers of the Philadelphia corporation would not\r\n     receipt for $850,000 when they were to receive only\r\n     $750,000, for the reason that they could not square the\r\n     transaction with their stockholders, and the buyer's agent\r\n     would not consummate the deal without such a receipt,\r\n     because he could not square with his client and its\r\n     stockholders the payment of $850,000 with the consideration\r\n     of $750,000 mentioned in the deed. This story was told to\r\n     illustrate the proposition that every action has its\r\n     prompting motive, and my fellow-passenger imparted to me his\r\n     conclusion that the motive of the manager of the New York\r\n     corporation for refusing to listen to his client was that\r\n     \"the scoundrel was in cohoots with the agents to share in\r\n     the commission and cheat his own company.\" The public will\r\n     in time come to look for motives, and we, fellow-editors,\r\n     and the managers of mutual life-insurance companies, will be\r\n     judged by what seems the most apparent motive for our\r\n     actions....\r\n\r\n     Any alliance between life insurance and this modern\r\n     speculative frenzy cannot be too deeply deprecated, nor too\r\n     strongly reprobated. Every true friend of honest life\r\n     insurance among insurance journals will demand that this\r\n     great business, of all businesses, must be kept free from\r\n     the contagion of corruption that has shamed finance, is\r\n     covering commerce with a blighting mildew, and threatens our\r\n     whole land with disaster as well as dishonor.\r\n\r\nAll this is preliminary to treating the case of the Prudential Insurance\r\nCompany. I want to say here that I do not know the corporation, any of\r\nits officers, nor any one interested in the control or management of it,\r\nand personally have never had the slightest connection with its\r\nofficers. I desire to prove through an outsider, some one of\r\nunquestioned authority, that the great insurance companies are part of\r\nthe \"System\" and are engaged in manipulating the stock-market with the\r\nfunds their policy-holders put in their hands as a sacred trust. In so\r\nfar as the Prudential is concerned, rank and unsound as are the\r\ntransactions I am about to speak of, my investigations have proved to me\r\nthat this insurance corporation is only as a baby-carriage to a runaway\r\nautomobile compared with the three great representatives of the\r\n\"System,\" the New York Life, the Mutual, and the Equitable. Certain\r\ncritics have accused me of being unduly emphatic in my strictures on the\r\ndoings of the corporations of which I am treating. I will confess to a\r\nsecret amusement at being able, in this instance, to quote the language\r\nof one of the most conservative insurance officials in America,\r\nFrederick L. Cutting, for many years Insurance Commissioner for the\r\nState of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe Prudential Life Insurance Company has $2,000,000 capital stock. The\r\nstock is owned and the company absolutely controlled by a few men. This\r\ncapital of $2,000,000 represents only $91,000 paid in in cash; the\r\nbalance has been derived from stock dividends; that is, profits that\r\nhave been made out of policy-holders. In addition to this enormous\r\namount, there has been paid ten per cent. in cash dividends annually, so\r\nthat for every thousand dollars paid in the stockholders hold $22,000 of\r\nstock, upon which they receive annually $2,200, or, as Commissioner\r\nCutting puts it, \"each year for ten years the stockholders have received\r\nin cash dividends more than twice the original investment.\" I commend to\r\nthe policy-holders of the Prudential and other insurance corporations,\r\nand to other honest men, these tremendous figures: every $1,000 invested\r\nturned into $22,000, not in a gold or diamond mine, but in a\r\nlife-insurance company where every dollar comes from the policy-holder\r\nwho is supposed to pay in only enough to insure a promised payment plus\r\nprovision for honest expense.\r\n\r\nThe Prudential Company owned the stock of the Fidelity Trust Company,\r\nthe capital of which was $1,500,000, and the directors came before\r\nCommissioner Cutting and informed him that they proposed to double up\r\nthe stock of the Fidelity Trust Company to $3,000,000; that the new\r\n$1,500,000 at a par value of $100 was to be sold for $750 per share;\r\nthat the new stock was to be bought by the Prudential Company and the\r\nEquitable Company; and that with the proceeds of the sale, the Trust\r\nCompany was to buy a control of the Prudential Company from its\r\ndirectors. The motive of this transaction was as follows: The set of men\r\nwho absolutely controlled the Prudential, with its sixty millions of\r\nassets belonging to its policy-holders, proposed to control it for all\r\ntime, but without tying up $7,000,000 of their own money in the\r\nbusiness. In other words, they desired to eat their pudding and yet have\r\nit for continuous re-eating, and had found a way to accomplish this\r\nheretofore impossible feat.\r\n\r\nBy this plan the men who controlled the Prudential Company, and thereby\r\nthe Trust Company, at the time the plan went into force, would forever\r\ncontinue to manage and control both institutions, although not one of\r\nthem held a policy or any investment in the insurance company beyond the\r\none share of stock required by law to qualify as director.\r\n\r\nIf this scheme had been consummated it would have borne to \"frenzied\r\nfinance\" the same relationship that perpetual motion does to mechanics.\r\nBy it a few men could gamble forever with the entire assets of the\r\npolicy-holders of this corporation for their own personal benefit. If my\r\nreaders will imagine the same scheme applied to several other great\r\ninsurance companies and the men controlling them, the \"System's\"\r\nvotaries, they will recognize the \"System's\" ideal world, with all the\r\npeople in a condition of ideal servitude. However, this ingenious plan\r\nwas forestalled because there happened to be in control of the\r\nlife-insurance affairs of Massachusetts one of those old-fashioned\r\nrelics of American honesty--a man who thought more of the interests of\r\nthe people intrusted to his care than of the prospect of innumerable\r\n\"made dollars\" which might have been his had he proved more amenable. It\r\nis regrettable that he was not able to deprive the conspirators of their\r\npower to juggle with the property of the corporation, for only two weeks\r\nlater they developed and executed an alternative device which\r\npractically accomplished the result which the Massachusetts authorities\r\nhad declared illegal and the courts of New Jersey had enjoined.\r\n\r\nThere is food for thought here for the policy-holders of American\r\ninsurance corporations who have intrusted to the \"System\" and its\r\nupholders the billions of their savings, to which they are adding every\r\nyear hundreds of millions. To them I recommend a reading of the\r\nForty-eighth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner,\r\ndated January 1, 1903, and the decision of the New Jersey judge who\r\npassed on the case. These men are surely not to be accused of exploiting\r\nmy story. Under the head of \"Control of Life Insurance Companies\" in the\r\nMassachusetts Report will be found the following:\r\n\r\n     The Insurance Commissioner had the honor of addressing the\r\n     insurance committee of the General Court relative to the\r\n     control of life-insurance companies by other corporations or\r\n     by syndicates. For some years it has seemed to impartial\r\n     observers who are conversant with life-insurance matters,\r\n     and have also seen the eager quest by promoters for funds to\r\n     finance all kinds of enterprises, and the determined\r\n     struggle to grasp every opportunity for speculation, that\r\n     there would be no cause for wonder if covetous glances\r\n     should be turned toward the massive accumulations of\r\n     life-insurance companies. It is well, therefore, to pause\r\n     and ask what would be the chances for obtaining control of\r\n     them, and what might be the result of such control, and in\r\n     general whether the funds of such companies are imperilled\r\n     by modern methods.\r\n\r\n     Insurance corporations on a capital stock basis, on the\r\n     other hand, give their policy-holders no voice in their\r\n     management. To obtain control of such a company it is\r\n     necessary only to control by purchase or otherwise a\r\n     majority of its capital stock. If a \"king of finance\" should\r\n     start out with the determination to secure a majority of the\r\n     stock of such corporations, the chances are that in some\r\n     cases at least he would be successful. He might, it is true,\r\n     be obliged to pay more than the \"book value\" of the shares;\r\n     but perhaps _control_ of a company's assets would well be\r\n     worth twice or thrice or even more than what could be\r\n     figured out as the value of the stock on the books of the\r\n     company. On no other theory can the figure offered for\r\n     life-insurance company stock in some cases be accounted for,\r\n     since these offers are not warranted by the surplus nor by\r\n     the dividends paid, nor by both combined.\r\n\r\n     Is there aught to prevent a bold manipulator from entering\r\n     this inviting field and purchasing a controlling interest in\r\n     the stock of enough such life-insurance companies to make\r\n     their combined assets aggregate one hundred million dollars\r\n     of the more than six hundred millions of assets of stock\r\n     life-insurance companies doing business in Massachusetts?\r\n     This accomplished, he transfers his rights to a \"trust,\" or\r\n     an association, or trust company, which is not only a bank\r\n     of deposit, but is also engaged in brokerage schemes, in\r\n     financing large enterprises and promoting all kinds of\r\n     corporate consolidations, and underwriting their stock for a\r\n     consideration. The central controlling trust company, or\r\n     whatever it may be, becomes a medium through which the\r\n     investments of the controlled insurance companies are made;\r\n     all sales of their securities pay tribute to its treasury;\r\n     all funds awaiting investment are deposited in its keeping;\r\n     the most valuable of their securities are turned into cash,\r\n     and then used by the controlling power for such purpose as\r\n     it sees fit. All these things are conceivable, and their\r\n     accomplishment would be a no greater task, seemingly, than\r\n     some of the gigantic \"operations in finance\" of the last few\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     Judged by what has happened in other fields, this trust\r\n     would not only control these vast assets, if the plan should\r\n     be executed, but would control them without individual\r\n     liability on the part of its managers.\r\n\r\n     THE PRUDENTIAL MERGER CASE\r\n\r\n     Is there really any danger, it may be asked, that any trust\r\n     or syndicate will attempt to control the stock and assets of\r\n     life insurance in this way, or is this simply the\r\n     presentation of possibilities? As an answer to that question\r\n     here follows a plain, unvarnished story of what has been\r\n     attempted and what has taken place within the past year\r\n     between one of the life-insurance companies doing business\r\n     in Massachusetts and a trust company with which it has close\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     In October, 1902, the Insurance Commissioner received from\r\n     the president of the Prudential Insurance Company of America\r\n     a letter, transmitting a copy of a circular letter addressed\r\n     \"To the field and home office staff\" of the company. That\r\n     circular letter disclosed a plan of mutual control between\r\n     the insurance company and the Fidelity Trust Company, a\r\n     corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey. It\r\n     stated that:\r\n\r\n     \"The capital of the Fidelity Trust Company is about to be\r\n     increased from $1,500,000 to $3,000,000, the new stock being\r\n     sold at $750 per share. This will result in giving the\r\n     Fidelity Trust Company a capital of $3,000,000, a surplus of\r\n     $13,000,000, and a considerable amount of undivided profits,\r\n     making this company, from the standpoint of capital and\r\n     surplus, as large if not larger than any similar institution\r\n     in the country. Sufficient of this stock will be taken by\r\n     the Prudential Insurance Company to give it, together with\r\n     its present very large holdings of Fidelity stock, absolute\r\n     control of that company. A very large portion of the balance\r\n     of said stock is to be taken by the Equitable Life Assurance\r\n     Society of New York, which will give to that company a very\r\n     substantial interest in the Fidelity Company, and therefore\r\n     justify it in materially increasing its business with the\r\n     Fidelity. The bulk of the new money thus to be received by\r\n     the Fidelity Trust Company is to be used by it in the\r\n     acquisition of a controlling interest in the entire capital\r\n     stock of the Prudential Insurance Company.... A contract has\r\n     been entered into between the Fidelity Trust Company and a\r\n     large majority of stockholders in interest of the\r\n     Prudential, in which the latter have contracted to sell\r\n     their holdings of Prudential stock, or as much as may be\r\n     necessary, to the Fidelity Trust Company on or before May\r\n     1st next, at $600 for every $100 of par value.... While by\r\n     this arrangement the Prudential Company will control the\r\n     Fidelity, and, on the other hand, the Fidelity will own a\r\n     majority of the capital stock of the Prudential, the annual\r\n     meetings of the two companies will be so arranged and other\r\n     arrangements be so made that the Prudential will forever be\r\n     the dominant factor, as of course it should be. The officers\r\n     of the Prudential are united in their belief that this move\r\n     is of the greatest possible interest to its stockholders, as\r\n     well as to all of its policy-holders and its great army of\r\n     employees. The consummation of this arrangement insures the\r\n     continuance of the present management of the Prudential,\r\n     both in its home office and in the field. The advantages of\r\n     the plans of the trust company are too obvious to need\r\n     comment. It is expected to consummate this entire\r\n     transaction between the two companies on or about February\r\n     1, 1903.\"\r\n\r\nThe Insurance Commissioner of Massachusetts, on receipt of this\r\ncircular, wrote United States Senator John H. Dryden, president of the\r\nPrudential Insurance Company of America, declining to approve of the\r\nproposed exchange of stock on the ground that the merger was\r\nantagonistic to the interests of policy-holders, inasmuch as it forever\r\ndeprived them of the power to dislodge the management from the control\r\nof the institution. The minority stockholders petitioned the New Jersey\r\ncourts for an injunction to restrain the Prudential and the Trust\r\nCompany's directors from carrying out the proceeding for mutual control,\r\nand Vice-Chancellor Stevenson enjoined the corporation from executing\r\nits project. However, the reciprocal control was effected by the sale of\r\nenough Prudential stock to the Fidelity, whose capital was increased for\r\nthe purpose of purchasing it, so that the Fidelity lacks but eight\r\nshares to control absolutely the Prudential. As the situation stands\r\nnow, the Prudential directors control the Fidelity, and the Fidelity\r\nholdings, with eight shares more, control the Prudential. Practically\r\nthe ring is about as hard to break into as the plan enjoined. Those who\r\ncontrol the Fidelity can always \"dominate\" the insurance company.\r\nMinority stockholders and policy-holders alike are practically in the\r\nhands of the trust company for all time, and the insurance company's\r\nassets can be managed as the majority of the trust company's directors\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nThe director goes on to explain the relations between a life-insurance\r\ncompany and a trust company, which, in the light of recent exposures,\r\nseems prophetic.\r\n\r\n     \"The money value of intimate relations between a majority of\r\n     the directors of a life-insurance company and a trust\r\n     company may be easily comprehended. These relations are at\r\n     the beginning based on the needs of the insurance company,\r\n     which needs it is hard to define and limit, and accordingly\r\n     hard to say just where the provision for them becomes more\r\n     of an advantage to the trust company than to the insurance\r\n     company. Standards will differ, and change, too. But here,\r\n     let us say, is a great insurance company with over\r\n     $50,000,000 of assets which it has collected from its\r\n     policy-holders, and which are needed for carrying out their\r\n     contracts, and which safety requires shall be held in sound\r\n     investments. Such an insurance company has to have a large\r\n     and active bank account. It must deposit checks and all\r\n     forms of paper promises or orders for collection, and for\r\n     the payment of expenses and claims must have a large sum of\r\n     ready money. This is the absolute need; but the directors\r\n     are not bound by any legal requirements to limit their\r\n     deposits to just what will reasonably suffice as a margin to\r\n     pay current claims and expenses, nor are they required to\r\n     patronize any particular banks. They conclude, let us say,\r\n     that 'it will be safer' to take some banking institution for\r\n     such depository which they 'know about,' and of which,\r\n     perchance, some of them are directors, or in which, at all\r\n     events, they are stockholders. If no such trust company is\r\n     at hand, it is very easy to start one, and easy for the\r\n     directors of the insurance company to be in 'on the ground\r\n     floor.' The insurance company then begins to bestow its\r\n     patronage. The trust company, which is thus supplied with\r\n     funds, begins to feel the effects of this attention; by the\r\n     use of its big deposits large dividends are earned. A 'boom'\r\n     begins, and the director who 'had the sagacity' to invest in\r\n     the stock of the trust company when it was around about par,\r\n     sees his holdings advance by rapid strides until he is\r\n     offered perhaps ten times as much for his stock as its par\r\n     value. He has seen this stock advance in value in proportion\r\n     to the amount of funds of the insurance company which the\r\n     trust company had at its command. It has been worth much to\r\n     him 'to be on the inside,' and will be worth much in the\r\n     future for him to be on the inside if any new trust company\r\n     is to be a depository; the bigger the deposit, the more it\r\n     will be worth to him.\"\r\n\r\nAll thinking people, after reading these extracts from Insurance\r\nCommissioner Cutting's report, will ask: \"Why have we never heard of\r\nthis before?\" I can only answer that he found it impossible to get any\r\npart of the warning contained in it before the people. It should be\r\nremembered that the insurance companies annually spend millions of\r\ndollars with the daily, weekly, and monthly press--and it is unnecessary\r\nfor me to say more. My own advertisement calling attention to the\r\nlife-insurance chapters in the last issue of _Everybody's Magazine_ was\r\nrefused by some of the leading dailies of New York, Boston, Cleveland,\r\nand Pittsburg. When I called on the managing editor of one of\r\nPittsburg's leading dailies for an explanation of the publication's\r\ndeclination, he said: \"Don't mention me or you'll get me into trouble.\r\nOur copy for the advertisement was a day late and the insurance combine\r\nhad time to get in its work. The local managers sent a representative to\r\nall the papers warning them not to run your stuff, under penalty of\r\nlosing the big full-page annual from each of the three big companies, as\r\nwell as the numerous fliers through the year.\" One hears of the\r\nsagacious ostrich which, when pursued by an enemy, hides its head in the\r\nsand. The ostrich is wise in comparison with the \"System's\" votaries in\r\nthe year 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VULTURES FEEDING\r\n\r\nOwing to the claims of other subjects on my space, I left the subject of\r\nlife insurance for a few months. In the meantime President Alexander\r\nbegan his grapple with President Jimmy Hyde for the control of the\r\nmillions of the Equitable Life--the historic entanglement which has had\r\nsuch dire consequences for all concerned. In the April, 1905, issue of\r\nThe Critics I wrote as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen first I touched on the subject of life insurance and called\r\nattention to the manner in which the three great companies were juggling\r\nwith the immense funds entrusted to them by their policy-holders, the\r\n\"System\" raised a great outcry, declaring that I was unsettling the\r\nconfidence of the people in a sacred institution. At this moment we have\r\nthe chief officials of one of these huge organizations engaged in a\r\ndesperate and disgraceful struggle among themselves for its control.\r\nAll thought of the widow and the orphan, against whom they declared my\r\nhand had been raised, has been forgotten in the mad fight for supremacy\r\nover the accumulated millions in stocks, bonds, and in trust companies,\r\nfrom the secret manipulation of which the great private fortunes of\r\nsuccessful underwriters are derived.\r\n\r\nBefore definitely grappling with the evils of the insurance trust, I\r\nhesitated a long time. I realized my words would cause terror or\r\ndistrust among policy-holders and perhaps induce some misguided ones to\r\nabandon their insurance. After long consideration, however, I became\r\nconvinced that what I had to say would in the long run benefit all\r\npolicy-holders, insure the greater safety of their funds, reduce their\r\nannual premium-payments, and perhaps bring about the restitution of the\r\nvast amounts which in the past had been diverted from them to private\r\nindividuals. The response to my criticism was a flood of abuse. Instead\r\nof meeting my charges, the big companies denounced me for a liar and a\r\nmisrepresenter, and the insurance journals and subsidized press declared\r\nthat the things I had charged were impossible. Now, the president of the\r\nEquitable Life Insurance Company is openly accusing a leading member of\r\nhis board of trustees, who is one of the foremost votaries of the\r\n\"System,\" of loading the company with twenty-two millions of securities,\r\nwhich, as a member of the finance committee of the corporation, he had\r\npurchased for himself in his capacity as head of a great banking-house.\r\nOn the other hand, the president and his associates, who have hitherto\r\nswayed the destinies of the institution, are accused by the other party\r\nof conspiring to mutualize the institution, not for the benefit of the\r\npolicy-holders, but to conceal the traces of past misdeeds. Before this\r\nchapter is in the hands of my readers the officers and directors of this\r\ngreat insurance company may be before the courts and a condition of\r\naffairs spread out for the public's gaze such as will make my charges\r\nseem, in comparison with the actual truth, as chestnut-burrs to\r\nporcupines' quills.\r\n\r\nOne result achieved so far is an awakening of the people's attention to\r\nthe evils of present conditions; but let them beware of the remedies\r\nsuggested. The \"System\" is quick to adjust itself to storms it cannot\r\ncontrol, and there are many signs abroad that it is trimming its sails\r\nto fly before the present blow, ready when it shall abate to switch back\r\nto its old course, and, under fresh canvas, make up for lost time.\r\nAlready we have Senator Dryden, representing New Jersey and the\r\nPrudential Life Insurance Company in the United States Senate,\r\nintroducing a bill for Federal supervision of life insurance, and the\r\n\"System's\" hirelings throughout the land are clamorously agitating the\r\npassage of some such measure. It behooves the public to scrutinize\r\ncarefully the form of reform which these patriots approve. It may be\r\ntaken for granted that they will initiate nothing that will interfere\r\nwith their grip on the millions of the policy-holders or will divert fat\r\npickings and commissions from their own pockets. Once I asked a leading\r\nvotary of the \"System\":\r\n\r\n\"What would you do if by any chance the Government decided to get into\r\nthe railway business, and took a railway or so to see how government\r\ncontrol would work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" was the reply, \"we'd manage that all right! As soon as we saw it\r\ncoming, the stocks and bonds of the roads wanted would go up, so that by\r\nthe time Uncle Sam got ready to buy, it would be the fattest sale we\r\ncould possibly make. After that it would not be difficult to disgust the\r\nGovernment with its bargain, and before long the people would be glad to\r\nsell the property back to us, and we'd find a way to get it at slaughter\r\nprices.\"\r\n\r\nThe reformation of the big insurance companies is sadly needed, but\r\nreformation of a more drastic kind than they'll be willing to administer\r\nto themselves. To begin with, there should be a relentless probing of\r\ntheir stock transactions of the last fifteen years, followed by the\r\npassage of some simple laws regulating their investments. The\r\nrelationship between these institutions and the \"System\" would then at\r\nonce of necessity terminate, and we could say good-by to the _régime_\r\nunder which the expenses of the Big Three have enormously increased and\r\ntheir dividends to policy-holders have steadily declined while during\r\nthe same period the private fortunes of their officers and controllers\r\nhave flourished amazingly.\r\n\r\nI have been repeatedly asked to define the conditions that make it\r\npossible for these immense private fortunes to be gathered, within the\r\nlaw. An examination of the figures that follow will reveal the\r\nfar-reaching possibilities that reside in the direction of the billion\r\nof assets of the great insurance companies.\r\n\r\nThe last issued New York report (1903) shows that the three leading\r\ncompanies had in uninvested funds, all told, $70,212,453. Of this sum\r\ntotal there was \"deposited in trust companies and banks drawing\r\ninterest\"--at the _close_ of the year:\r\n\r\n  Equitable                  $25,617,668\r\n  Mutual                      22,439,396\r\n  New York                    17,731,710\r\n                             -----------\r\n                             $65,788,774\r\n\r\nthe balance, $4,423,679, being on deposit without interest.\r\n\r\nThe above aggregate represents 71.7 per cent. of the uninvested\r\ninterest-bearing funds of twenty-eight companies--leaving but 28.3 per\r\ncent. for the remaining twenty-five (in which, by the way, is included\r\n$6,801,789 of the Prudential, as large in proportion as the funds of the\r\nBig Three, with which it is associated).\r\n\r\nThis sum, at the two-per-cent. interest allowed by the trust companies,\r\nreturned to the insurance companies $1,315,775, while it earned for the\r\ntrust companies in the different speculations in which they were\r\nengaged, from five to twenty per cent., or an annual profit of\r\n$1,973,663 to $11,184,079, over and above the interest paid the\r\ninsurance companies for its use.\r\n\r\nBut who owns the trust companies? you ask. Some are owned jointly by the\r\nthree great insurance corporations and their directors, others by the\r\ndirectors alone. The men who control the Big Three organize these\r\nflexible depositary institutions, allotting half or more of their stocks\r\nto themselves, the balance to the insurance companies, or keeping all\r\nthe stock themselves, for the purpose of manipulating the stupendous\r\nsums in the treasuries of the insurance companies. The trust company is\r\nthe irrigating canal of Wall Street, the insurance company the\r\nreservoir. For the development of the various schemes of consolidation,\r\ntrustification, and amalgamation in which Wall Street profits are made,\r\nmoney is required in large quantities. When the soil is ready for the\r\nseed, when negotiations have been sufficiently matured, the trust\r\ncompany's sluice is tapped and the gold flows out. And gold which makes\r\na $225 crop sprout, where previously only a $100 crop grew, is a\r\nvaluable commodity, for the use of which large compensation is given the\r\nengineers. Thus the men who hold the treasury-keys of the Big Three, and\r\nwho decide how the accumulated premiums of the policy-holders shall be\r\nused and where deposited, are actually the owners of these trust\r\ncompanies and of other corporations and trusts which borrow the money\r\nthe trust companies have on deposit from the insurance companies.\r\n\r\nThe hackneyed defence of the insurance companies to this accusation is\r\nthat great corporations, such as they are, must keep on hand, ready for\r\nemergencies, enormous amounts of cash. This is a futile argument, for in\r\nthe nature of things the daily receipts of each of the Big Three are\r\nlarger than the expenditures. We are also told \"We keep large amounts,\r\nready to take advantage of a sudden smash in the market.\" This sounds\r\nwell, but cloaks one of the most vicious practices of these great\r\ninstitutions, and another of the insider's opportunities for private\r\ngraft. It means that the officers of the great insurance corporations\r\nare ever ready for a stock gamble with the sacred funds of their\r\npolicy-holders; that is, they admit their willingness to use the\r\npeople's savings to make sure-thing gambling-profits from those\r\nunfortunates who must throw over their stocks and bonds because of the\r\n\"System's\" manipulations.\r\n\r\nImagine, my honest, old-fashioned reader, the millions of insurance\r\nfunds used in this way! Let me give you a picture of how it is done. I\r\nhave seen it worked a score of times. The stock-market is crashing,\r\ndropping tens of millions a minute, and business men are saying: \"Oh, if\r\nwe only had cash to buy, but we can not get it! The banks will not loan\r\nat any price. Rates have gone up to 100 to 150 per cent. and no cash is\r\nin sight.\" No one has money but the big insurance companies and the\r\n\"System's\" votaries.\r\n\r\nSuddenly mysterious buying appears--hundreds of thousands of shares of\r\nstock, and bonds in million blocks. The crash has been stayed; the panic\r\nis over; stocks are bounding upward again; millions are being made by\r\nthe mysterious buyers with each tick of the clock, and presently it is\r\ncommon knowledge that all the insurance insiders have cleaned up\r\nmillions, and--of course, the company has made something, but the\r\nbiggest profits have been won by the men who, having previously\r\npersonally loaded up, were able to throw the unlimited buying power of\r\nthe policy-holders' millions into the gap. Talk of loaded dice, or any\r\nof the sure-thing gambling devices! They are lily-white business schemes\r\ncompared with this method of plundering the people.\r\n\r\nAgain we are authoritatively informed that the great companies have so\r\nmuch cash on hand that it is impossible to find investments for it save\r\nat a low rate of interest. The fallacy here is obvious. If these\r\ninstitutions have grown so unwieldy that they cannot conduct their\r\nbusiness as ably as the smaller companies, the latter are the ones to\r\ninsure with, because, right along, they are deriving larger returns from\r\ntheir invested funds than the big companies. There are scores of ways,\r\nhowever, by which the sixty-five millions could be made to earn even\r\nlarger dividends than do the funds in stocks and bonds. Let the Big\r\nThree offer the use of their big cash balances by public\r\ncompetition--under the most conservative conditions that can be\r\nprescribed. Instantly the net returns will double.\r\n\r\nAll insurance policy-holders are familiar with the specious circulars\r\nand letters presenting statements of business done and investments made,\r\nwhich are sent out from the head offices of the great companies at odd\r\nintervals on the plea: \"We want our policy-holders to know everything we\r\nare doing at all times.\" The public is assured at other intervals that\r\nthere can be no secret or inside deals in the affairs of insurance\r\ncompanies because of the close examinations they are subjected to by the\r\nInsurance Departments of the various States. The insurance officials\r\nsay: \"All our facts and figures are vouched for by so many different\r\nsets of auditors and State Departments that they must be exact truths.\"\r\nTo what extent is the public actually safeguarded by these\r\ninvestigations?\r\n\r\nSome months ago I called attention to the fact that the directors of the\r\nNew York Life Insurance Company had sold to themselves the stock of the\r\nNew York Security & Trust Company at from three to four millions less\r\nthan the property would have commanded from outsiders. Here is another\r\ntransaction which requires explanation:\r\n\r\nIn 1901, ostensibly in order to maintain its position in the German\r\nstates--I will explain later on what I mean by \"ostensibly\"--the\r\ninsurance company disposed of its remaining holdings of stocks, the same\r\nhaving a book value of $2,965,000 and a market value of $5,471,000, as\r\nper report of 1900. These stocks, with possibly sales of some other\r\nsecurities, realized an actual profit of $5,839,087 instead of\r\n$3,075,392 as per the company's _sworn_ report to the several State\r\nInsurance Departments.\r\n\r\nRather a queer proceeding, you say. Why should it do such a thing? Had\r\nsome one stolen the extra profit? Or what? This is what was done: The\r\ncompany had simply availed itself of the opportunity to conceal an\r\nactual cash profit of $2,763,715 in order that it might sequestrate\r\nassets to that amount unnoticed by its policy-holders or the\r\ndepartments. The sum so sequestrated was made up of balances due from\r\nagents--presumed, as in all such cases, to be amply secured by pledge of\r\nrenewal contracts--to the amount of $1,919,734, and $843,891 charged off\r\ndepreciation of real estate. (See Massachusetts Report, 1902, pages\r\n158-159.)\r\n\r\nThis illegal suppression of most important transactions, directly\r\naffecting, as will be seen later, the interests of policy-holders, would\r\nhave remained a sealed book but for the careful audit of the\r\nMassachusetts Department, which revealed the fact, unnoticed by that of\r\nany other State (note in this one instance the boasted careful\r\nsupervision and boasted double and triple auditing of all accounts\r\nbefore publication!), that the item \"Agents' Balances,\" amounting in\r\nthe preceding year to $1,527,123, had disappeared altogether from\r\nassets. This led to a prompt request from the Massachusetts Department\r\nfor explanation.\r\n\r\nThe honorable business men of the New York Life, who pay out so many\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars each year advertising the fact that\r\nthey are sitting up o' nights to find new ways to acquaint the\r\npolicy-holders with the innermost secrets of the company, finding there\r\nwas no avenue of escape from their dilemma, quickly realized that the\r\nMassachusetts Department meant to have the facts, and publish them, too.\r\nTheir own \"faked\" report was already before the public in the published\r\nreports of two departments, those of Connecticut and New York.\r\n\r\nThere was but one course open to avert the terrific scandal that was\r\ninevitable upon publication of the Massachusetts Report, and that was to\r\nhead off and forestall adverse comment and criticism, as far as\r\npossible, by making a clean breast of it. No time was lost in preparing\r\na letter of explanation to the Department. This answered the purpose of\r\nthe Department, which did not care to press the matter, having\r\naccomplished its main object.\r\n\r\nNow for the moral, or the iniquity, rather, of the preceding, the wrong\r\nto policy-holders, which has been so completely ignored and passed over\r\nby the insurance press and all hands: Either the company had, as at\r\nleast supposedly it has in all such cases, ample security for its\r\nadvances to agents in the pledges of their renewal contracts, or it had\r\nnot. On the former hypothesis, that $1,900,000-odd was a sound and valid\r\nasset, earning a good rate of interest. On the latter, the company\r\nsimply squandered this amount of trust funds belonging to its trusting\r\npolicy-holders in its mad rush for business at whatever cost; or--In\r\neither case the money has gone from sight so far as any sign or\r\nindication appears to the contrary since.\r\n\r\nAnd before leaving this point, it may be well to ask, \"Has the New York\r\nLife Insurance Company altogether discontinued these advances to\r\nagents?\" If not, how and where are they accounted for? An answer may be\r\nfound, possibly, in the comparatively meagre underwriting profits of the\r\ncompany, growing relatively smaller and beautifully less with each\r\nsucceeding year. I say it may possibly be found here, because this is\r\nthe only place the item could be buried; but I am reasonably sure that\r\nit is not buried here, and that these advances to agents are being\r\ncontinued on a scale as large as, or larger than ever, for the agents\r\ncould not have been shut off and the business increased at one and the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nAgain, during the last two months of 1904, or at a time when my story,\r\n\"Frenzied Finance,\" began to get in its work all over the world, I\r\nreceived from many quarters information that the Big Three had\r\ninstructed their leading agents to get in a great lot of new risks \"at\r\nany cost,\" so that the total business for the year would show such\r\nincrease as to discredit my claim that the policy-holders were getting\r\n\"scared.\" I watched the game with much interest, knowing that bunco\r\nwould out in time, by whomever worked. During these months I read from\r\nweek to week of this great policy, or that record-breaking risk just\r\nlanded by this or that agent. One in particular made me chuckle at its\r\ntransparency. A certain friend of the New York Life, a Wall Street man,\r\n\"has just taken out a $2,000,000 policy.\" About the same time I began to\r\nreceive information of the remarkable offers that were being made to\r\nprospective customers, offers which probably meant an indirect rebate of\r\nperhaps the full first year's premium; and I got to thinking and\r\nreaching back into my memory-box, and I raked out a number of instances\r\nof the same kind of offers which had been made to me in the past, and I\r\nruminated to myself how all this was possible; for even if the Big Three\r\nwere bold enough to get around the law against such practices, it\r\npuzzled me how they could pay to their agent the big cash commissions\r\nthat new business called for. Presently as I waited I read, as did the\r\nrest of the world, the big January full-page advertisements of the New\r\nYork Life to its policy-holders, calling their attention to the increase\r\nof $15,000,000 new business over the year before. Then I took another\r\nthink and did a little work, with the following result:\r\n\r\n\r\nA JOLT FOR THE NEW YORK LIFE\r\n\r\nThe \"Brown Book of Life Insurance Economics\" shows that the sum laid by\r\nannually for future tontine or other dividends ranged in the ten years\r\nending with 1903 from $2,936,026 to a minimum of $956,597, these amounts\r\nbeing savings after payment of dividends. In 1904, however, for the\r\nfirst time in the tontine history of the company--also the first year of\r\nmaturity of non-forfeitable tontine contracts with their largely reduced\r\ndividends--the dividends paid and credited, $6,018,202, actually\r\nexceeded the year's earnings, as shown by the company's sworn statement,\r\nby $76,595.\r\n\r\nI want to call policy-holders' attention right here to what this means\r\nto those who are now being beguiled into taking policies on the strength\r\nof \"adjusted\" estimates placed by the company in its agents' hands,\r\nshowing dividend results ranging from fifteen to fifty per cent. higher\r\nthan those of 1904, with, however, the saving (?) clause that, depending\r\nupon future unforeseeable conditions, the same \"may be higher or may be\r\nlower.\" It may be added that, but for a profit realized from sale of\r\nsecurities, the company's gross surplus would have shown shrinkage.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize what such a showing means, let us make a comparison,\r\nusing the figures of a well-known Western company (partly tontine, but\r\noperated on diametrically opposite lines from the New York Life), for\r\nthe three years 1901-03, this company being barely four-tenths the size\r\nof the New York Life as regards outstanding business:\r\n\r\n  COMPARISON OF TOTALS, THREE YEARS, 1901-03\r\n\r\n                           Dividend                   Laid by for future\r\n                           earnings.     Dividends.       dividends.\r\n\r\n  New York Life           $16,826,289   $13,189,278      $3,636,091\r\n  Western Company          17,788,820    12,284,255       5,504,565\r\n                          -----------   -----------      ----------\r\n                            -$962,531     +$905,023     -$1,867,574\r\n\r\nAfter mulling these over, I dug further in regard to the \"prosperity\" as\r\nshown by the business of 1904. The company boasts of its enormous volume\r\nof new business, $345,722,000, which is $15,000,000 in excess of the\r\n1903 business. Here is the story: While this new business was being\r\nsecured, the\r\n\r\n  Total terminations were                         $162,326,114\r\n  Less those inevitable terminations by death\r\n    or maturity of endowments                       26,767,873\r\n                                                  ------------\r\n  Waste by lapse, surrender, etc.                 $135,558,241\r\n  And when we add the lapsed policies which\r\n    continued in force, under the \"extended-insurance\"\r\n    provision                                       89,938,500\r\n                                                  ------------\r\n  We have the total waste of                      $225,496,741\r\n\r\nand this, reduced to its actual significance, means that of the total\r\nactual terminations, 83.6 per cent. was _actual waste_ and only 16.4 per\r\ncent. legitimate terminations, while the great bulk of the last item of\r\n$89,938,500, upon which premium payments have ceased, must run off the\r\nbooks in the near future; and this is what goes on from year to year,\r\nmore than keeping pace with the boasted increase in volume of new\r\nbusiness. The public never sees this side of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to this point in my deductions, I was brought face to face\r\nwith the tremendous expense of acquiring new business. Then I saw the\r\nlight--why it was necessary to wipe off the books nearly two millions of\r\nwhat were considered good assets, that is, pledges from agents of their\r\nrenewal commissions against which advances had been made, and where the\r\nnew business came from, and how it was possible to make rebates when the\r\nlaw says they shall not be made. An agent induces a friend to have a\r\npolicy written, for which the agent practically pays the premium out of\r\nhis commission, and thereupon has advanced to him large sums against the\r\nfuture premiums which are to be paid by the policy-holder, who has no\r\nintention of paying them, and allows his policy to lapse. Heavens! What\r\na vista of plundering opportunities the bare thought opens up! Somebody\r\nhas to pay.\r\n\r\nTHE MILLION-DOLLAR POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the May number I inserted the following letter:\r\n\r\n     FORT WORTH, TEXAS, February 16, 1905.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON, ESQ., Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I have read and will continue to read your\r\n     articles on \"Frenzied Finance,\" published in _Everybody's\r\n     Magazine_, with a great deal of interest. I have noted\r\n     especially your statements in reference to the big\r\n     life-insurance companies, as I am a policy-holder in both\r\n     the New York Life and the Equitable.\r\n\r\n     Under the heading of \"Lawson and His Critics,\" in\r\n     _Everybody's_ for January, you give your side as to the\r\n     assertion on the part of the insurance companies that you\r\n     have been refused life insurance, among other things\r\n     publishing a fac-simile of a contract of life insurance\r\n     between yourself and the Equitable Life Assurance Society\r\n     for $1,000,000. On my first reading of your article, I was\r\n     certainly impressed with the fact that you had $1,000,000 of\r\n     insurance with this company. On a second reading, I note\r\n     that you do not say in so many words that this is a policy\r\n     in force, but you say: \"Well, look at this reproduction of\r\n     the document that is now in my possession and always has\r\n     been since the date when it was delivered to me by one of\r\n     the great representatives of the 'System,' The Equitable\r\n     Life Assurance Society.\" This statement taken in connection\r\n     with others, conveys the idea that you are insured in the\r\n     company named.\r\n\r\n     In conversation with a gentleman a few days since, who\r\n     claims to know whereof he speaks, having gotten his\r\n     information direct from New York, he stated that you had no\r\n     policy in the Equitable Life Assurance Society for\r\n     $1,000,000, or any other amount, and that the reproduction\r\n     referred to above, was of a _sample copy_ of a policy, and\r\n     not a real contract.\r\n\r\n     As your editor states that you will answer any pertinent\r\n     question, I will ask the following, trusting that you may\r\n     consider it pertinent: Have you a valid subsisting policy in\r\n     the Equitable Life Assurance Society for $1,000,000, the\r\n     fac-simile of which appears in _Everybody's Magazine_ for\r\n     January, 1905?\r\n\r\n     Trusting you will favor me with a reply, I am,\r\n\r\n     Very truly, ----\r\n\r\nI answered:\r\n\r\nSince the chapter which contained the fac-simile of the million-dollar\r\npolicy was published I have received many letters similar to the above,\r\nbut have not answered any because I wished to see how far the insurance\r\npeople would go in this matter. Finding I did not reply to the\r\ndifferent attempts they made in their subsidized journals to draw me\r\nout, they grew bolder, until the use of this million-dollar policy has\r\nbecome the chief defence of the Big Three companies. I want my readers\r\nto think this point over and weigh its significance carefully. In a\r\nprevious chapter I called attention to the fact that there is nothing to\r\nprotect the policy-holder from being robbed of the amounts he has\r\ninvested to insure his family from poverty after his death but the\r\nhonesty of the men who really control the big insurance companies as\r\nabsolutely as any of their policy-holders do their personal affairs. If\r\nthese men are honest, policy-holders in their companies may rest easy\r\nfor the time being; but if they are dishonest, the policy-holders should\r\ncall them to account, for these men have it absolutely in their power to\r\nmake way with the funds of the companies they manage until there will\r\nnot be a dollar left for policy-holders.\r\n\r\nTherefore the one thing for policy-holders to settle, the one vital\r\nthing is, Are these men honest, or are they tricksters and liars?\r\n\r\nTo settle this point they must be weighed in the same way that all other\r\nmen and women in this world are weighed--by the simple, ordinary\r\nstandards: Do they lie? Do they trick? Do they cheat?\r\n\r\nWhen I made my charges in my first chapters against the votaries of the\r\n\"System\" who controlled the insurance companies, they met my specific\r\ncharges as dishonest men would meet them, not as honest men would. They\r\nimpugned my motives, and specifically charged that my reason for\r\nattacking them was that I had been blacklisted by all insurance\r\ncompanies and could not get insurance from any of them.\r\n\r\nWhile it was immaterial so far as my specific charges went whether this\r\nwas so or not, it had a most decided bearing upon the question whether\r\nthe officers and controllers of the Big Three insurance companies were\r\nhonest or dishonest men. Therefore I picked up their accusation and\r\nbegan a line of argument to prove they were tricksters and absolutely\r\ndevoid of honor.\r\n\r\nI showed, by reproducing the personal letters of President McCall, of\r\nthe New York Life, to my office and to my house, reënforced by his\r\nspecial agent's letter, and these reënforced by his Boston agent's\r\nletter, that I had been continuously and urgently importuned to take\r\ninsurance during the time he said I was blacklisted. The insurance\r\npeople met this by the excuse that these were not personal letters, but\r\nmere advertisements.\r\n\r\nI then reproduced the million-dollar policy, hoping to drag from the Big\r\nThree a specific charge that this, too, was an advertisement.\r\n\r\nOf course, I did not pretend that the policy in question was in force,\r\nthat is, that I was insured in the Equitable Life Assurance Society for\r\none million dollars. This would have been too childish; first, because\r\nevery insurance policy, particularly the very large ones, is as much a\r\nmatter of record, to be got at by any one in the insurance business, as\r\nare real-estate records; and, next, because that which I printed had the\r\nsignature punched out, which made it obvious that it was not in force.\r\nMy object was to lead the Equitable into the positive statement that it\r\nwas an ordinary advertisement, when I would have reproduced the\r\nproposition that accompanied it and which the Equitable made in probably\r\nthe most elaborate set of documents ever assembled by an insurance\r\ncompany for the purpose of inducing one of the \"best risks\" in America\r\nto take out a \"great big policy.\" These constitute the complete argument\r\nwhich was made by the Equitable Life Assurance Society to persuade me to\r\ntake a million dollars' worth of insurance. They are engrossed upon\r\nparchment and bound in a specially gotten-up morocco cover, and, I was\r\ntold, cost the insurance company between four and five hundred dollars.\r\nThey were presented to me as the result of my demanding that all the\r\ninducements they offered to come into their company should be put down\r\non paper, so that there could be no mistaking them. The documents as\r\nengrossed and the terms of the contract were carefully copyrighted by\r\nthe Equitable, and are now on my table before me as I write.\r\n\r\nThe question which the publication of the million-dollar policy was to\r\nsettle was whether or not I had been importuned to take out great sums\r\nof insurance in the leading insurance company of America, and it proved\r\nexactly what I had contended--that I had been so importuned.\r\n\r\nUp to and including my April, 1905, instalment I have made specific\r\ncharges against the great insurance companies, the Mutual, the New York\r\nLife, and the Equitable:\r\n\r\n1st. That the control of the officers of these great corporations over\r\nthe billion dollars of their policy-holders' funds is as absolute and\r\nunrestricted for all practical purposes, as is their control of their\r\nown personal affairs, and is largely exercised for their personal\r\nenrichment.\r\n\r\n2d. That the policy-holders have absolutely no voice in the management\r\nof these companies or the control of their funds, because of the\r\nmanipulation of proxies in the New York Life and the Mutual and the\r\ncontrol of the stock of the Equitable.\r\n\r\n3d. That those who do control the big companies are votaries of the\r\n\"System,\" and as such are subject to the \"System's\" orders as absolutely\r\nas is James Stillman, president of the \"Standard Oil\" National City\r\nBank.\r\n\r\n4th. That the insiders of these insurance companies, not one but several\r\nof them, have accumulated fortunes in the past few years, of from one to\r\ntwenty millions, while at the same time premium-rates have advanced and\r\ndividends decreased.\r\n\r\n5th. That under the present methods of conducting these great companies\r\nit is as inevitable as it was in the case of 520-per-cent. Miller or\r\nMrs. Howe's Woman's Bank, that as soon as they can get no more\r\ninsurance, the funds behind the old insurance will be dissipated and a\r\ncrash take place such as the world has never known before.\r\n\r\n6th. That the companies are \"milked\" in every direction, through the\r\npurchase and sale of real estate, through the loaning of their millions,\r\nand through the manipulation and investment of their funds.\r\n\r\n7th. That they acquire new business at an expense and by methods which\r\nalone will in time wreck the companies.\r\n\r\n8th. That in a single instance the New York Life sold securities for\r\n$5,839,087, but its statement under oath to the State Insurance\r\nDepartments showed receipts of only $3,075,392.\r\n\r\n9th. That the New York Life sold the stock of the New York Security &\r\nTrust Company, which it held, to its insiders for over $4,000,000 less\r\nthen they could have secured for it from others.\r\n\r\nI have specifically charged other things, and will, as my story\r\nproceeds, make many more specific charges of as serious a nature; but\r\nthe above suffice for my present argument, which is, that up to and\r\nincluding the April number I have made these accusations and that the\r\nonly way they have been met is by underhand mud-slinging and by alleging\r\nthat the incentive for my attack was that I could not secure insurance\r\nfrom any of the American companies; and I have met this with absolute\r\nproof, which must stand until it is disproved, that I have been during\r\nthe past ten years importuned and urged by the large insurance companies\r\nof America to take out insurance.\r\n\r\nTherefore I will leave the question of this million-dollar policy and\r\nother forms of importuning until the insurance companies offer something\r\nin rebuttal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAY OUT\r\n\r\nThe overhauling of the Equitable Life exposed conditions far worse than\r\nI had indicated to the public, and it seemed probable that the usual\r\nwhitewashing process would be utilized to conceal the guilt of the\r\nrapacious criminals who had been untrue to the most sacred trust that\r\ncan be imposed on man. Since that time, however, the Governor of the\r\nState of New York has appointed a committee to investigate the affairs\r\nof the Big Three corporations, and the resulting disclosures are the\r\nsensation of the hour as this book goes to press. In order to protect\r\nthe interests of policy-holders, in case the authorities declined to\r\nact, I issued the following address in the July, 1905, number of\r\n_Everybody's_:\r\n\r\nTO THE POLICY-HOLDERS OF THE NEW YORK LIFE, MUTUAL, AND EQUITABLE\r\nINSURANCE COMPANIES\r\n\r\nThe time has come for you to act. When, less than a year ago, I began my\r\nstory, \"Frenzied Finance,\" I exposed the function of the three great\r\nlife-insurance companies in the structure of the \"System.\" I explained\r\nthat they were controlled in the interests of great financiers and that\r\ntheir funds were juggled with to compass the huge plundering operations\r\nof Wall Street. At that time the New York Life, the Equitable, and the\r\nMutual Life loomed before the American people as the greatest, most\r\nrespected, and most venerable institutions in our broad land. To-day\r\nthey stand for all that is tricky, fraudulent, and oppressive.\r\n\r\nA great change to have been accomplished in less than twelve months!\r\n\r\nMy readers are by this time familiar with the condition of affairs in\r\nthe Equitable. The greed, juggling, and grafting practised by its\r\nofficers and controllers have been fully exposed through the press. I\r\nhope none of those who have followed the terrific arraignment of\r\nrottenness and rascality made through the Frick report are so foolish as\r\nto imagine that the evils described are confined to the Equitable. In my\r\nown opinion the Equitable is much less reprehensible than the New York\r\nLife, and when that institution and the Mutual are thoroughly shaken up,\r\nas they will be in the future, indubitable evidence of the same fashion\r\nof extravagance, trickery, and fraud will be found in plenty. Conditions\r\nin the three institutions are the same; though of late the New York Life\r\nhas altered the character of most of its securities. Each has piled up\r\nan immense surplus which has been used through allied trust companies\r\nfor stock juggling; each has paid extravagant commissions to agents; the\r\nfunds of each have been managed to afford to high officials plentiful\r\nopportunities of graft; each has its real estate, fire insurance, low\r\nrent and loan favor graft; in each will be found the same type of\r\nsyndicates as President Alexander and Vice-President Hyde used for their\r\npersonal enrichment in the Equitable. To-day President John A. McCall of\r\nthe New York Life is credited with possessing a fortune of between ten\r\nand fifteen millions--a few brief years ago he was State Superintendent\r\nof Insurance in Albany. The chief associate in the management of the\r\nsame corporation, George W. Perkins, J. Pierpont Morgan's partner, is\r\nanother very rich man, whose wealth has been accumulated in a few short\r\nyears. Do you imagine for a moment that such transactions as I set forth\r\nlast year in connection with the New York Security and Trust Company, in\r\nwhich the interest of the New York Life was sold to a syndicate of its\r\nown directors for a sum far below the market value of the shares, were\r\nput through without the connivance of President McCall and\r\nVice-President Perkins? Even if the New York Life, as its president\r\nexplains, did make a large profit on the sale of the trust company's\r\nstock, he cannot deny that the syndicate paid far less than the then\r\nmarket value of the shares for the insurance company's holdings.\r\n\r\nThere is something particularly vile about the crimes of these high\r\nofficials and distinguished gentlemen who have been waxing fat and\r\nluxurious on life-insurance graft. In a recent number of this magazine I\r\ndrew a parallel between the confidence operator and the burglar to show\r\nthat the latter despises the former for a sneak thief who takes no\r\nchances in his thieving operations. Infinitely more depraved than the\r\nsneak thief is the high-placed functionary, presiding over a great\r\ninstitution built up out of the savings of millions of people, paid an\r\nimmense salary for his important services, trusted with vast funds\r\nbecause of his reputation for integrity and business sagacity--who yet\r\nuses his splendid place to line his own pocket. Of all fiduciary\r\ninstitutions, life insurance should be the most sacred. Its chief\r\nfunction is to care for the widow, the orphan, and the helpless. The\r\nmillions of revenue paid annually into the life-insurance companies of\r\nthis country represent the blood and tears and sweat of millions of\r\nAmericans who thus provide for the care of their dear ones for the time\r\nwhen death shall have put an end to their own income-earning abilities.\r\nThe administrator of a trust so solemn and exalted should devote himself\r\nto its safeguarding as a priest dedicates himself to the service of his\r\nMaker. The responsibility conferred on him is the highest and holiest\r\nman can repose in his fellow-man. Remembering all this, consider again\r\nthe revelations of greed and plunder in the Equitable; consider that\r\nmillions upon millions of dollars have been filched and wasted; analyze\r\nthe Frick report and the letter of President Alexander to the directors\r\nof the society, calling for Vice-President Hyde's removal from office.\r\nThink, ye farmers and laborers, of personal traveling expenses of\r\n$75,000 in a brief period, of salaries of $100,000 annually paid for a\r\nfew hours of work per day; think of vast sums of your money used to\r\nprovide expensive safe-deposit institutions with low-priced quarters so\r\nthat the personal income of men already multimillionaires may wax still\r\ngreater. Think of the great institution to whose hundreds of millions'\r\nincome you contribute your hard-earned dollars, being farmed, milked,\r\nand squeezed by a pack of dissolute and greedy schemers and robbers more\r\nconscienceless and oppressive than any band of thugs in the country.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to discuss in _Everybody's Magazine_ the subject of the\r\nthree great life-insurance companies, I stated that there is actually\r\nnothing between the two million-odd policy-holders and the possibility\r\nof their being robbed of the billions of dollars of their accumulated\r\nsavings but the devotion and the honesty of the men who are in control\r\nof these institutions.\r\n\r\nYou know what happened when I said this to you the first time--less than\r\na year ago. The officers, trustees, and hirelings of these great\r\ncompanies laughed to scorn my statements and called me a liar and a\r\nscoundrel. They drew the attention of the whole world to the standing\r\nand wealth and honesty of the men who managed these great corporations,\r\nand proved by the most positive asseverations that nothing could be more\r\npreposterous than that any one of them could do wrong. But the great\r\nGod, who seldom allows His children to remain long deceived to their\r\nundoing, heard these loud-mouthed protestations, and to-day the world is\r\nlistening to exposures of low, mean thefts and contemptible crimes far\r\nworse than any to which I had pointed.\r\n\r\nAnd from whom comes the proof of the treacheries and rascalities\r\nperpetrated within the Equitable? From the men who control and manage\r\nthis great institution and its hundreds of millions of accumulations.\r\nWhen my accusations first appeared, these men saw the handwriting on the\r\nwall and some of them, bolder than others, determined to seize these\r\nvast hoards of the public's money and at the same time get possession of\r\nall evidence of past crimes so that they might be immune forever after\r\nfrom punishment and the necessity of making restitution. In the act of\r\ngrabbing, however, the robbers fell out with one another, and, presto!\r\nthey are in the public square where all men, women, and children, cats,\r\ndogs, and asses may see and hear as they gouge, bite, and accuse each\r\nother of the vilest crimes.\r\n\r\nThese are the men in whose custody even now are the accumulations on\r\nwhich you, Mr. Policy-holder, are depending to take care of your wife\r\nand little ones, should you die. On the honor and responsibility of men\r\nwho in the past five years have \"saved\" out of salaries of $20,000 to\r\n$100,000, private fortunes of millions, you must absolutely rely for the\r\nsafety of the billions of dollars of your savings. The future of the\r\nhelpless beings whom your hard daily labors provide with a livelihood is\r\nin the hands of men who admit having expended $100,000 of your money to\r\nprovide a lordly and regal entertainment for a set of extravagantly paid\r\nagents and solicitors who, spurred on by prodigal inducements, have\r\npiled up huge amounts of new business on the company's books. I have\r\nexplained to you before what such business is worth, that the agent gets\r\nso large a commission that he is practically in a position to accept\r\nrisks at far below their cost to the company, and that such business as\r\nthis is seldom renewed. The same men have been paying personal\r\nsecretaries, gardeners, and flunkies out of your earnings; they have\r\nbeen feasting and traveling in private cars with large parties of the\r\nNew York flubstocracy at your expense; every possible extravagance they\r\nhave been guilty of by means of the revenues some of you have worked\r\nfourteen to eighteen hours a day to gather in. Shame, I say, on such\r\ncontemptible thievery.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist the temptation to pull back the slide from one episode\r\nof the past. When my strictures on the three great life-insurance\r\ncompanies first appeared, one of the vice-presidents of the Equitable,\r\nGage E. Tarbell, in writing to an inquiring policy-holder, said: \"Pay no\r\nattention to Lawson; he is only a reckless stock gambler, and every\r\nsensible person knows that any man, no matter what his position might\r\nbe, who would do anything to cause loss to the class of people we\r\ninsure, must be a rascal.\" And this is the same man Tarbell, it is now\r\nadmitted by all the Equitable officers and investigating committees,\r\nwho, as soon as he saw the crisis coming in the affairs of the\r\nEquitable, had his pal, President Alexander, pay to him $135,000, which\r\nhe claimed was due him for commission renewals, even though he was then\r\nin receipt of a salary of $60,000 per annum for his services. It is\r\nthrough the operations of this same Tarbell that the vast system of\r\nrebates, one of the chief evils of the present system of life insurance,\r\ncame into being, and through his prodigality that the immense sum of\r\n$2,000,000 stands on the books of the company, representing advance\r\ncommissions to the pampered agents.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for all you policy-holders to act, and there is but\r\none way to act.\r\n\r\nA thousand and one schemes are afloat to confuse and trick you at this\r\nperiod. The cry is--anything to hush things, to confine the fire to the\r\nEquitable, at any cost, even though it totally consumes the $400,000,000\r\nof the people's savings in that institution. I told you at the beginning\r\nthat the New York Life was worse, if anything, than the Equitable, and\r\nthe Mutual Life just as bad. Therefore I unqualifiedly advise\r\npolicy-holders to:\r\n\r\n1. Pay up this year's premium--it will be the last to these plunderers.\r\n\r\n2. Have nothing to do with any committee or scheme.\r\n\r\n3. Write me, at once, your name, address, and the amount and character\r\nof your policy. I want nothing more from you, and under no consideration\r\nwill I divulge your name without your further consent in writing.\r\n\r\nI already have the names of thousands of policy-holders, but to make my\r\nplan instantly effective I must have scores of thousands.\r\n\r\nMy plan has for its aim and end, this and only this:\r\n\r\nThe absolute preservation of the face value of your policy.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of future premium payments to forty cents on the dollar on\r\nwhat you now pay.\r\n\r\nThe restitution of millions upon millions looted from the three great\r\ncompanies, or as much as can be collected after a careful examination of\r\nthe books--and the punishment of the thieves.\r\n\r\nBear in mind _that I will not have any money connection with you in the\r\nworking out of my plan. I pay my own expenses. I will not ask any reward\r\nor profit, money, office, or otherwise, nor will I under any\r\ncircumstances accept any._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Policy-holders reply coupon.]\r\n\r\nIn response to this appeal I received over sixteen thousand proxies,\r\nrepresenting over fifty-four millions of insurance. The investigations\r\nmade by the legislative committee of the State of New York are\r\nunearthing in a most thorough manner the iniquities of the directors and\r\nmanagers of the Big Three, and before proceeding further I shall await\r\nthe results of its work. If there is any way short of criminal\r\nproceedings to compel the restitution of the millions diverted or stolen\r\nfrom policy-holders, I shall begin suits which I am satisfied can be\r\nfought to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALL TO ARMS\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary disclosures made before the investigating committee of\r\nthe New York Legislature, which is now conducting inquiries into the\r\nmethods of the great insurance companies, led me finally to issue the\r\nfollowing open letter to John A. McCall, in which I review the\r\ncontroversy between us and contrast his disclosures of corruption and\r\nmismanagement with his brazen professions of virtue and probity made\r\nlast year. In order to wrest the two great mutual companies from the\r\ncontrol of men who are obviously unworthy to direct them and with whom\r\nthe policy-holders' funds are plainly unsafe, I asked for proxies which\r\nwould make it possible for me to bring about a change in the control of\r\nthese two great corporations.\r\n\r\nThis letter and call appeared in the November, 1905, issue of\r\n_Everybody's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OPEN LETTER TO JOHN A. McCALL, PRESIDENT NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE\r\nCOMPANY\r\n\r\n_Sir_: It is time your attention was called to the moral sense of the\r\nAmerican people. It is time some one dragged you out of the Wall Street\r\nconservatory and set you in the plain white light of daily life. It is\r\ntime you were shown yourself as you are to-day seen by the millions of\r\nyour countrymen who, a month ago, believed you to be a great and\r\nhonorable man.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the terrible exposures of the past few weeks, in spite of\r\nthe pitiless revealment of yourself and your directors as tricksters,\r\nin spite of the unveiling of the jugglery, grafting, and corruption of\r\nyour administration of the most sacred trust that can be confided to\r\nman, you remain unconvinced of your fall and unpenetrated by your shame.\r\nFortified by the sympathy of your fellow-sinners, you imagine your\r\naudacious bluster and your sly evasions before the Investigating\r\nCommittee of the State of New York represented shrewd generalship and\r\nable strategy, forgetting that the enemy against whom your manoeuvres\r\nwere directed was the American people and that, in this inquisition,\r\nyour character and reputation were as absolutely before the bar as\r\nthough you had been indicted for sequestration of the funds of some dead\r\nfriend's wife.\r\n\r\nThroughout this broad country of ours are good Americans who have slaved\r\nand toiled to gather up the hundreds of dollars which you have exacted\r\nfrom them yearly as the price of the future livelihood of their wives\r\nand children, or as the provision for their own old age. You have made\r\nyourself the custodian of these funds under sacred pledge of square\r\ndealing and safe and honest administration. You have made yourself the\r\nnational executor, the great depositary of the moneys of the widow and\r\nthe orphan. You have cried your virtue and honorableness from the\r\nhousetops, and, under the stress of your pleadings, hundreds of millions\r\nof dollars have been confided to you annually--half the savings of the\r\nnation have been turned into your coffers, all because you insisted that\r\nyou were honest beyond all other men, and that the dear ones left behind\r\nmight rely on your generosity and integrity for their support.\r\n\r\nAnd it is with the moneys that might at any time have been claimed by\r\nthese widows and orphans that you have been rigging syndicates,\r\ndebauching legislatures, juggling judges, manipulating stock-markets,\r\nand doing other things which will be proven later. Instead of employing\r\nthe vast power and the immense wealth intrusted to you to conserve the\r\ninterests of your policy-holders, you have made yourself a part of the\r\ncruel robbing machine which the \"System\" has created to deprive the\r\nAmerican people of their savings. Under the pretence of seeking\r\nprofitable investment, your corporation has been perverted into a vast\r\nstock-gambling agency. You have filled the high places in your\r\ncorporation with your own children and relatives and their relatives,\r\nand conferred on them great salaries out of which they have grown rich.\r\nYou have paid out to friends and associates, on various pleas, millions\r\nthat rightly belonged to your policy-holders. You have done all these\r\nthings habitually, yet to-day you describe the investigation being\r\nconducted into your operations as an impertinence, and secretly you\r\nregard this inquisition and all that pertains to it as a waste of time\r\nand energy. You are unrepentant, unashamed, and defiant.\r\n\r\nI shall take this opportunity, sir, of reviewing our own relations\r\nduring the past year and contrasting your position to-day with that you\r\nboasted twelve months ago.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, in _Everybody's Magazine_, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The officers, trustees, and officials of the 'Big Three' life-insurance\r\ncompanies have been and are systematically robbing their policy-holders.\r\nThey are grafters--mean, contemptible grafters.\"\r\n\r\nI gave specific instances of their thieveries.\r\n\r\nYou replied, not by haling me to court, but by:\r\n\r\nCirculating throughout the world documents by the millions, disparaging\r\nmy reputation by advertisements and \"news\" and \"editorial\" statements\r\nfrom your subsidized insurance press, denying my charges and attacking\r\nmy character, all at the expense of your policy-holders.\r\n\r\nYou libelled me in thousands of private letters to policy-holders, many\r\nof which came back to me.\r\n\r\nYou employed James M. Beck, ex-Assistant Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates, then and now chief attorney for Henry H. Rogers, the Standard\r\nOil Company, the \"System,\" and the Mutual Life Insurance Company, to\r\nridicule my utterances and asperse my honor in addresses in the cities\r\nof Philadelphia and Boston.\r\n\r\nYou employed James H. Eckels, ex-Comptroller of the Currency of the\r\nUnited States, now president of the Commercial Bank and representative\r\nof the \"System\" in the West, to attack my arguments and distort my\r\nmotives in Chicago.\r\n\r\nYou ordered Vice-President Perkins, of the New York Life Insurance\r\nCompany, to perform similar service in Philadelphia; and\r\n\r\nThe burden of all these documents, advertisements, and disguised\r\nadvertisements and addresses was: \"Lawson is an unmitigated liar and\r\nscoundrel, whose sole reason for attacking the insurance companies is\r\nthat we refused him insurance.\"\r\n\r\nI replied by printing your personal letter to me, wherein you importuned\r\nme to accept insurance in your company.\r\n\r\nAgain you gave me the lie, and pronounced your letter spurious.\r\n\r\nI replied to you and your followers by instancing cases of perjury,\r\nbribery, and false statements.\r\n\r\nI stated that your claim that your company did not own, nor loan upon,\r\nstocks was false, and that it was made for the purpose of misleading and\r\nimposing upon your policy-holders, banks, trust companies, Government\r\nofficials, and investors.\r\n\r\nYou answered this by writing a letter to one of the great churchmen of\r\nAmerica, and in it you said: \"I pledge you my word of honor this company\r\nhas never, since 1899, had a dollar's interest, directly or indirectly,\r\nin any stock. Lawson knows this, and deliberately, for his own base\r\npurposes, makes charges to the contrary which he knows to be false.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day you and your fellow-plunderers stand convicted in the eyes of the\r\nwhole world not only of juggling the moneys of the widow and the orphan\r\nin the stock-market, but of manipulating these trust funds for the\r\nbenefit of your own pockets. To-day the world is aghast at your perfidy\r\nand amazed at your temerity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the turpitude already exposed to the people, you still\r\nimagine you can so conduct yourself as to prevent the investigators from\r\nfastening on you and your associates the more desperate crimes that have\r\nbeen committed in the past--the 150 to 200 millions stolen and diverted\r\nor used in corruption. You know as I do that only the very edges of this\r\nnational cesspool have yet been uncovered. You know that not only have\r\nthe ballot-box and the Legislature at Albany been tampered with, but\r\nthe law-making and administering machinery of other States corrupted,\r\nthe Federal Government surrounded, and certain of the judiciary of\r\nAmerica \"educated.\"\r\n\r\nYou believe you can keep the evidence of these crimes from the American\r\npeople by the same kind of bluff and effrontery with which you met my\r\nfirst charges. But you have mistaken the tempers of your countrymen.\r\n\r\nI have been authorized in writing by over 16,000 policy-holders,\r\ncarrying over fifty-four millions of insurance, to act for them.\r\n\r\nI had intended to await the finish of the New York investigation before\r\nproceeding, but as I have had placed in my hands during the past few\r\ndays evidences of the determination of yourself and your accomplices and\r\nfellow-conspirators to face it out regardless of consequences, and as I\r\nbelieve men capable of committing the acts that have been proved during\r\nthe past few days are fully capable of taking the transportable part of\r\nthe billion and a quarter funds to foreign countries, and of using them\r\nto keep themselves from their justly deserved punishments, I have\r\ndecided to act now.\r\n\r\nIn sending you this open letter, I am actuated only by a desire to bring\r\nyou and your associates to such a sense of the seriousness of your\r\nposition that you will see it is useless longer to attempt to defy the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nYours, for the Exposure of Corporation Sneak Thieves,\r\n    THOMAS W. LAWSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIFE-INSURANCE POLICY-HOLDERS\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my story, in 1904, I made certain accusations\r\nagainst the management of the three big life-insurance companies.\r\n\r\nI knew, when I began my story, that the big life-insurance companies\r\nwere in the hands of grafters and thieves, just as are the great banks,\r\ntrust companies, railroad companies, and big corporations and trusts.\r\n\r\n_This I knew_ and, in plain language, said it.\r\n\r\nThe big insurance companies, through their officers and trustees,\r\nreplied by declaring: \"He's an unmitigated liar.\"\r\n\r\nI kept at my knitting, for I knew the crimes of these insurance grafters\r\nwere such that, sooner or later, the world would have an opportunity to\r\njudge fairly who were the unmitigated liars and thieves.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is at hand.\r\n\r\nTo-day the press of the world is devoting its space, news and editorial,\r\nto a recital of the contemptible and heinous crimes of the New York Life\r\nand the Mutual Life Insurance companies--not as I relate them, but as\r\ntheir own officers and trustees publicly confess them.\r\n\r\nIn the July instalment of my story I called upon policy-holders to sign\r\na coupon blank inserted in _Everybody's Magazine_, and send same to me\r\nthat I might speak for them in a plan to further their interests.\r\n\r\nIn response to my call I have received up to October 4, 1905, 16,307\r\nanswers, representing $55,165,916.\r\n\r\nI think my readers, when they analyze the following list and take into\r\nconsideration the character of the senders, many of whom are men of the\r\nhighest standing--bishops, ministers, governors, mayors, judges,\r\nsenators, members of Congress, railroad, bank, and trust company\r\npresidents--will agree with me that it is the most remarkable collection\r\never made by one interest since life insurance began.\r\n\r\n                           INSURANCE COUPONS\r\n\r\n

as I received a number of signatures sufficiently large to\r\nwarrant it, I quietly began operations.\r\n\r\nThe first direct result is the investigation now being held. This\r\ninvestigation has proceeded far enough to put before the public absolute\r\nproof of all the crimes I have charged, and three to thirty times as\r\nmany more.\r\n\r\nIt is now evident to all that:\r\n\r\n1st. The policy-holders in the great companies have yearly paid into\r\ntheir company scores of millions more than necessary.\r\n\r\n2d. The policy-holders have been robbed of scores of millions.\r\n\r\n3d. The vast funds now on hand have been habitually used by the grafters\r\nnow in control of them in the rankest kind of stock-gambling.\r\n\r\n4th. These funds have been used to corrupt the ballot-box and the\r\nlaw-makers of the country.\r\n\r\nI repeat, absolute proof of all this has been made public.\r\n\r\nIt should now be evident to all that:\r\n\r\n1st. The funds now on hand are in actual jeopardy, because they are in\r\nthe absolute control of unprincipled scoundrels.\r\n\r\n2d. Unless something is done, and done at once, by the policy-holders,\r\neach and every one of the largest companies may become insolvent; that\r\nis, they may not be able to meet the engagements of their policies,\r\nbecause of waste of funds, tremendous falling off of new business,\r\ntremendous cost of new business, and the nature of the new\r\nbusiness--so-called \"graveyard business\"; for I am credibly informed\r\nthat they are now seeking to insure those who formerly have been refused\r\ninsurance because of physical infirmities.\r\n\r\nIt should also be plainly evident that, if the policy-holders move, and\r\nmove quickly, they can be absolutely assured that:\r\n\r\n1st. The funds as they are to-day will remain intact.\r\n\r\n2d. They will be added to by the restitution of from $75,000,000 to\r\n$150,000,000.\r\n\r\n3d. A score of the thieves who have plundered policy-holders in the past\r\nwill be sent to prison.\r\n\r\n4th. The future payments of policy-holders will be largely cut down.\r\n\r\n5th. The present swollen surpluses will be returned in large part to\r\npolicy-holders.\r\n\r\n6th. In the future policy-holders will actually run the company.\r\n\r\n7th. All policy-holders can be assured that in the future they will\r\nreceive the actual worth of their policy at surrender.\r\n\r\nAll this being so, it is most eminently desirable for policy-holders to\r\nact, and at once.\r\n\r\nThe time will never again be so opportune, for if nothing definite is\r\ndone now, policy-holders will be discouraged for all time.\r\n\r\nI have given the subject the closest and most earnest study, assisted by\r\nthe best insurance experts and lawyers procurable, and guided by the\r\nsuggestions of over 100,000 policy-holders, for in addition to the\r\n16,000 mentioned, I have received over 90,000 letters. I have come to\r\nthe conclusion that the one thing for policy-holders to do now is:\r\n\r\nTo authorize some one in whom they have confidence to select a committee\r\nto take their proxies and at once seize possession of the two great\r\nmutual companies, the New York Life and the Mutual.\r\n\r\nI omit the Equitable at this stage, because litigation may be necessary\r\nbefore the Equitable, being a stock company, can come into the\r\npolicy-holders' hands. But in the other two, no obstacles can be placed\r\nin the way of the policy-holders' taking control.\r\n\r\nTo empower this committee to bring action at once to compel full\r\nrestitution and enforce full punishment, and then to change the present\r\nmethod of conducting the insurance business.\r\n\r\nThe vital question is: Whom can the policy-holders trust to do this?\r\n\r\nThe \"Big Three\" are at present spending vast sums of the policy-holders'\r\nmoney to prevent some such action as this, in the following ways:\r\n\r\nFirst, by moulding public opinion through paid news and editorial items;\r\nnext, by the collection of proxies; and third, by the inauguration of\r\ndifferent moves and dummy suits and investigations.\r\n\r\nThere are already three of these affairs under way. Almost any way the\r\npolicy-holders turn for relief they are confronted with traps which, if\r\nthey fall into them, will make relief and rescue impossible.\r\n\r\nAny man or body of men who go to the great expense necessary to collect\r\nproxies must have some hidden scheme for reimbursing themselves, or they\r\nmust be working in the interests of the thieves now in control.\r\n\r\nI therefore make bold to say: I am the natural one to make this move.\r\n\r\nJust a minute before you pass judgment. Let us see if I am:\r\n\r\n1st. I have already spent in my work over a million dollars of my own\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n2d. I am willing to spend, if necessary, two millions more.\r\n\r\n3d. I will absolutely prove I want nothing in return.\r\n\r\n4th. I will absolutely prove on the face of my plans that I cannot in\r\nany way benefit beyond the satisfaction I shall derive from putting\r\nanother spike in the \"System's\" coffin.\r\n\r\nI ask of the policy-holders simply this:\r\n\r\nFill out the following form of proxy; sign and seal it, and send it to\r\nme. Quick action is most desirable in view of contingencies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] In the course of the legislative investigation of the great insurance\r\ncompanies in New York, it developed that the Mutual Life Insurance Company\r\nconducts a publicity bureau, organized to discredit any one who dares\r\ncriticise its methods. This bureau is conducted by one Charles J. Smith, on\r\na salary of $8,000 per annum, and he works through Allan Forman, editor of\r\nthe _Journalist_. Forman maintains a \"telegraphic news bureau\" and secures\r\npublication in various newspapers or periodicals of matter sent him for\r\ndissemination by the Mutual Life, and he is paid $1.00 per line of the\r\npolicy-holders' money on all matter for which he obtains publicity. The\r\nwhitewash paragraphs recently published throughout the country in regard to\r\nPresident McCurdy and the Mutual Life were all paid for on this basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE ENEMIES I HAVE MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man discovers that a public building full of men, women, and\r\nchildren is infested with rats and that these vicious rodents have\r\nundermined its foundations and honeycombed its structure, it becomes his\r\nduty, first, to warn the occupants of the presence of the rats, next, to\r\nshow them the damage that has been wrought and how the rats can be\r\ntrapped and killed--and then he may take a hand in the rat-hunt himself.\r\n\r\nThat is about what I have been doing, and if proof were needed that the\r\n\"System\" suffered under my exposure of its villainies, I should have it\r\nin plenty in the showers of mud bullets it has fired at me. From scores\r\nof quarters these volleys came. A regular army of the \"System's\"\r\nvotaries must have been out working like Trojans to stop my work, to\r\ndiscredit me, to bespatter me with its dirt.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the \"System\" writhed under my attacks showed how\r\nseriously it was hurt. What surprises me was that so little intelligence\r\nwas exhibited in defaming me. Such wanton, foolish attacks those that\r\nwere made on me personally! As though it mattered who or what I am in\r\ncomparison with the accusations I have made. Americans are not fools. To\r\nsay that Lawson is this or that does not minimize or detract from his\r\ncharge of robbery and conspiracy.\r\n\r\nEvery morning after I began to write \"Frenzied Finance\" I found a new\r\nbudget of personalities in my mail, in the newspapers, in pamphlets.\r\nLearned lawyers traveled about the country slinging mud at me at\r\nbanquets and society gatherings; scores of hireling weekly and monthly\r\npapers devoted pages to vilifying me; the insurance press was laden\r\nwith assaults, and for fear the public should miss the brickbats, the\r\ninsurance companies carefully mailed them to their policy-holders. All\r\nthese tirades were in one key--that of crude abuse. The statements about\r\nmyself and my career were nothing but lies. They were not even cleverly\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nUpon entering on this crusade against \"Frenzied Finance\" I expected\r\nattack. Reforms are not matured to accompaniments of incense and\r\nrose-water, and I had made up my mind to disregard the mud and its\r\nslingers. Afterward, if there were any \"System\" left, I rather looked\r\nforward to smothering it beneath the foulness of its own generating.\r\nThere came a time during the year, however, when I deemed it proper to\r\ndepart from this resolution and nail some of the lies my enemies were\r\ncirculating about me. I debated the subject thoroughly, for the rancor\r\nof these assaults was evident and I could not help feeling that the\r\ngeneral run of my readers would be impatient of the space given these\r\ngutter rakers. The determination to go at them was clinched by a letter\r\nwhich came to me, with a number of others from clergymen of various\r\ndenominations, from a learned Catholic priest, who put the case for a\r\nreply most earnestly. He said:\r\n\r\n     You owe it, my son, to yourself to clear away, for once and\r\n     all, the charges your enemies have made against you. I have\r\n     faith you mean all that you say, but there are many, many\r\n     sons and daughters who are troubled in heart and harassed in\r\n     mind with doubt whether your motives be pure, and if your\r\n     deeds in the past have been along the ways of the good. It\r\n     is my advice, if you will accept it, that you put aside your\r\n     pride and your dignity and frankly and openly tell us\r\n     whether these charges that we read are true or false.\r\n\r\n\r\nBECK VS. LAWSON\r\n\r\nI shall deal with the subject as fairly as possible, reminding my\r\nreaders, however, that I am at a disadvantage in having to use pen and\r\nink instead of the implement appropriate for the purpose, a hose\r\nconnected with a disinfectant barrel. To begin with, I reproduce the\r\nfollowing from the Toledo _Blade_, December 26, 1904. (I have similar\r\nparagraphs clipped from one hundred other papers.)\r\n\r\n     JAMES M. BECK FLAYS LAWSON\r\n\r\n     Calls Boston Author-Broker a Frenzied Fakir.\r\n\r\n     DEFINES MONEYPHOBIA\r\n\r\n     Declares He is Victim of New Disease--Compares His Actions to \"Crazed\r\n     Malay Running Amuck.\"\r\n\r\n     PHILADELPHIA, December 26th.--Ex-Assistant Attorney-General\r\n     James M. Beck talked on \"Moneyphobia\" at the thirty-ninth\r\n     annual commencement exercises of the Peirce Business\r\n     College. He paid his respects to Thomas W. Lawson in such\r\n     terms as \"frenzied fakir\" and \"crazed Malay running amuck.\"\r\n     ... \"There are abundant indications that this epidemic is\r\n     now rife in the community. The extraordinary vote polled by\r\n     a Socialistic candidate for President, in a time of general\r\n     prosperity, seems to evidence this, as does the avidity with\r\n     which many intelligent people read in a cheap 'penny\r\n     dreadful' magazine the incoherent, self-contradictory, and\r\n     self-incriminating articles of a notorious frenzied fakir,\r\n     who, like a crazed Malay, is wildly running amuck, and,\r\n     without rhyme or reason, slashing at the reputations of\r\n     judges, senators, and financiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from a Chicago insurance paper, and comes to me with\r\nthe marginal inscription, \"Puncture this bladder when convenient.\" I may\r\nsay that I receive hundreds of clippings every day from various parts of\r\nthe country, sent me by correspondents who are determined I shall be\r\napprised of what my antagonists are trying to do against me.\r\n\r\n     BANKER ECKELS AND BROKER LAWSON\r\n\r\n     The splendid tribute to our country's greatness, resources,\r\n     and possibilities given by President James H. Eckels, of the\r\n     Commercial National Bank, of Chicago, and ex-Comptroller of\r\n     Currency of the United States, before the Chicago Life\r\n     Underwriters' Association, was listened to with earnest\r\n     attention.\r\n\r\n     The brilliant young financier ... believes in life insurance\r\n     for the people. It creates the valuable habit of saving. He\r\n     deprecates the malicious attacks on companies by men of\r\n     mysterious motives, and feels it will be a sorry day if they\r\n     ever become objects of prey for political thieves.\r\n\r\n     The banker paid his respects to Thomas W. Lawson, of Boston,\r\n     whom he characterized as a notoriety seeker and branded as a\r\n     \"discredited, disreputable, despised stock-jobber who\r\n     glories in his infamy.\" Mr. Eckels lashed Lawson with\r\n     caustic language, and stated the American people of judgment\r\n     are not misled by his diatribes.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Eckels believes that life-insurance presidents reach\r\n     their high stations by their own ability and grasping of\r\n     opportunities. Because a man is elevated to a position of\r\n     eminence and responsibility does not mean he is dishonest.\r\n     He arrives there because he cannot be held down and remains\r\n     as long as he proves his worth. The banker declared that\r\n     life companies, with their vast funds, were being safely\r\n     guided by men of superior mental mould.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Eckels referred to President McCall, of the New York\r\n     Life, as being a clerk in a State bureau office when he\r\n     first made his acquaintance. He said President McCall had\r\n     advanced, like other company executives, owing to his own\r\n     ability and genius for management.\r\n\r\nIn an early article in this series I stated that one of the favorite\r\noperations of the \"System\" is to pick off those officials who have\r\nexhibited unusual talent or energy in protecting the interests of the\r\nNational Government. In this way they secure the services of men who\r\nknow the secret workings of the people's institutions and how best to\r\nguard the corporations against the consequences of their misdeeds.\r\nDuring the Cleveland administration there developed a \"financial\r\nphenomenon,\" James H. Eckels, Comptroller of the Currency. It did not\r\ntake long for the astute Rogers-Morgan-McCall clique to see that this\r\nyoung man's knowledge of finance in connection with his governmental\r\nposition might prove a dangerous obstacle to their machine if he were\r\nnot captured. It was not long before he was captured.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Eckels during the Cleveland bond performance. I need not enter\r\ninto the details of that extraordinary affair here, for it is one of the\r\nsore spots in recent American history. Briefly, the Administration at\r\nWashington attempted to issue $100,000,000 government bonds and deliver\r\nthem in a snap sale to the \"System.\" The New York _World_ began a\r\ncrusade against the transaction, and was so successful that the\r\nAdministration was compelled to offer the issue to the public through\r\ncompetitive bids. The result--the bonds fetched many more millions for\r\nthe Government than if the deal had been allowed to slip along the ways\r\nthe \"System\" had greased for it. I remember well the scene at the\r\nopening of the bids. It was in the United States Treasury at\r\nWashington. With many others who desired an allotment of the bonds, I\r\nwas present. We were crowded into a small room, and following the\r\ndirection of young Mr. Eckels, who handled the transaction, we gave him\r\nour bids, which, according to the advertised programme, were in sealed\r\nenvelopes. After all the bids were submitted--mine was for a number of\r\nmillions--the envelopes were taken by Mr. Eckels into a rear room. Then\r\na few of the leading financiers present, among them John A. McCall, of\r\nthe New York Life, J. Pierpont Morgan, and one or two others of the\r\n\"System's\" foremost representatives, got their heads together and began\r\nan earnest conference. Certain of them went out of the room and after\r\nawhile returned for a further conference. There were several such\r\nconfabulations and comings and goings, until finally, after a monotonous\r\ndelay, the bids were opened and the bonds awarded. Morgan, McCall, _et\r\nal._, had secured the bulk of the issue at a price many points above\r\nwhat any one had been led to believe the bonds would sell for, and many\r\npoints higher than the \"System\" and the Government had proclaimed to the\r\npeople they could possibly sell for, yet at a price which showed\r\nmillions of profit a few hours after the bids were opened. I do not\r\ncharge that the public's envelopes were opened and \"peeked\" into before\r\nthe \"System's\" bids were sealed. Such a charge is not necessary. It has\r\nbeen made many times by the press. Mr. Eckels, to the minds of such of\r\nus as could see through cracks in a floor wide enough to drive a\r\nfour-in-hand coach into without unhooking the leaders, had lived up to\r\nhis rôle as a financial phenomenon, and when some time afterward it was\r\nbruited abroad that this able young man was to have the presidency of\r\nthe City Bank, or any other large bank belonging to the \"System\" that he\r\nmight select, there was no surprise, although much comment, in Wall\r\nStreet. Mr. Eckels finally accepted the presidency of the Commercial\r\nBank of Chicago, where he now is one of the important cogs in the\r\n\"System's\" machine.\r\n\r\nThe case of James M. Beck has points of similarity. Mr. Beck, a young\r\nPhiladelphia lawyer, obtained a valuable knowledge of the secrets of the\r\nDepartment of Justice in Washington as Assistant United States\r\nAttorney-General, and in the prosecution of the Northern Securities suit\r\ngot an insight into the \"System's\" methods. It will be remembered that\r\nat the trial of the suit he made a great appearance and became famous as\r\nthe young champion of the people who had succeeded in \"busting\" this\r\nnotorious trust. The victory was hardly announced before it became known\r\nthat the brilliant Assistant Attorney-General had renounced the cause of\r\nthe public and had been engaged at a large salary as chief counsel for\r\nHenry H. Rogers, of Standard Oil.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck has proved a most available and flexible servant in the cause\r\nof his master. He has done Mr. Rogers's bidding in a manner befitting\r\nthe best traditions of \"Standard Oil.\" Almost his first work was the\r\ntrial of the famous Boston Gas suit, in which for weeks he \"steered\"\r\nHenry H. Rogers while on the witness-stand in the Massachusetts Supreme\r\nCourt. The very night before this case was to be called for trial, the\r\neminent young \"trust buster\" and people's champion called on my attorney\r\nand made him a proposition. It was that I should meet Mr. Beck and agree\r\nupon the details of certain testimony that Mr. Rogers and Kidder,\r\nPeabody & Co. (the \"System's\" Boston representatives), and myself would\r\nbe called upon to give upon the witness-stand next day. My attorney\r\nbrought the proposition to me.\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens!\" I said, \"is it possible that this man has the audacity\r\nto come to Boston and ask me to commit perjury?\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not put it in just those words,\" my attorney answered.\r\n\r\n\"No, but he says he wishes to _match up_ testimony with me so that we\r\nmay all testify alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it,\" my attorney answered.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"I have got to state the facts, and the facts are\r\ndiametrically opposed to the testimony Mr. Rogers and the others are to\r\ngive. This looks to me like subornation of perjury.\"\r\n\r\nMy lawyer would not have it that way, and I instructed him to secure\r\nfrom Mr. Beck a writing as to just what he wished me to do, and that\r\nwriting I have at the present time. In it he states that if I do not\r\nsee him and agree upon the testimony to be submitted in the Supreme\r\nCourt of Massachusetts the following day, there may be developments\r\nwhich will be decidedly uncomfortable for Mr. Rogers and perhaps for the\r\nrest of us.\r\n\r\nI did not meet Mr. Beck, and Henry H. Rogers and Kidder, Peabody & Co.\r\ntold one story and I another. Bald perjury was committed by some one.\r\nHowever, I will give all the facts, including the \"match up\" letter,\r\nwhen I come to them in my story.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck and Mr. Eckels are the two men designated by the \"System\" to\r\nattend public gatherings and vilify Thomas W. Lawson. They are at it,\r\nindustriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DONOHOE EPISODE\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first chapter of \"Frenzied Finance\" appeared, Henry H.\r\nRogers turned loose on me one Denis Donohoe, a character thug whom he\r\nhad imported from California for just such emergencies. Donohoe's first\r\nservice for Mr. Rogers was a vicious onslaught on Heinze, of Montana, in\r\nthe New York _Commercial_. This was an attack of such unusual vulgarity\r\nand malignity that it won Donohoe his spurs, for soon afterward, when by\r\na characteristic trick Mr. Rogers obtained possession of the New York\r\n_Commercial_, he made Donohoe its editor. I may mention that Heinze sued\r\nthe _Commercial_ for $300,000 damages, and apropos of the suit an\r\ninteresting complication occurred which seriously interfered with Mr.\r\nRogers's plans. The night before the old owners, from whom Mr. Rogers\r\nhad grabbed the _Commercial_, were to be thrown into the street, they\r\nthreatened, by way of reprisal for the mean trick that had been served\r\non them, to confess judgment to Heinze. One was president and the other\r\nsecretary of the company, and this action would have settled the\r\nproposition. Rogers, treated to a dose of his own medicine, had to make\r\na compromise, and the men are still on the paper. The details of this\r\ngood story are to be found in the Detroit _Journal_. It was fitting that\r\nwhen I began my exposures of the \"System\" this thug should be ordered\r\nto do his worst by me, and he began the series of virulent assaults that\r\nthe _Commercial_ published and advertised all over the country. The\r\nfirst of these was devoted to proving me crazy, and it was carefully\r\ncirculated by my friends the insurance companies by way of offsetting\r\nthe effects of my revelations of their jugglery of the people's funds.\r\nLater I showed up the fellow so vigorously that John D. Rockefeller\r\nordered Mr. Rogers to muzzle him in his own paper, whereupon\r\narrangements were made with a New York weekly to act as the\r\nsewer-conduit for the lies and abuse this thug was warranted to turn\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI should not dream of dealing with this man or his fatuous attacks in a\r\nrespectable publication save that he has been appointed the \"System's\"\r\nchief defender. It really seems as though the game were too small to\r\ntake time for its killing, but as these weak and febrile maunderings\r\nreally represent the \"System's\" reply to my charges, it may be worth\r\nwhile to show, once and for all, what idiotic lies they put forth and\r\nwhat a silly and ineffective falsifier it is that they have made their\r\nchampion. I shall take the second article of the series and contrast\r\nDonohoe's statements with the actual facts.\r\n\r\n     Incidents in Mr. Lawson's versatile career which even those\r\n     who are not censorious might well deem shameful.\r\n\r\nIf in my career I have done anything of which I or any honorable man\r\nshould be ashamed, then I am willing to stand convicted of all that this\r\ncharacter thug charges against me--of being a stock-jobber, fakir, liar.\r\n\r\n     He claims, if the writer understands him aright, that he is\r\n     _animated solely_ by a keen regard for the public weal in\r\n     performing what he describes as a public duty.\r\n\r\nI stated positively in the Foreword of my story, and have reiterated\r\nmany times since, that in making these revelations I am actuated first\r\nand mainly by a desire to benefit the people of this country, not only\r\nby informing them how they are being plundered, but how they can in the\r\nfuture guard themselves, and that if it were necessary to accomplish my\r\npurpose I would spend every dollar I possess; but mixed with this desire\r\nis a hatred of the \"System\" as deadly as a man can have for anything\r\nhuman. I have also reiterated that at such stage of this revelation as\r\nis possible I shall secure from the \"System\" every dollar I can wring\r\nfrom it to be used in my fight against it, provided always I can get its\r\ndollars in legal, fair, and above-board fighting ways--I mean, in the\r\nopen market.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson appears before the bar of public opinion as a\r\n     volunteer witness for the commonwealth--\"state's\r\n     evidence\"--as the lawyers phrase it--and hence his\r\n     reputation, his motives, his character, his every act,\r\n     become at once fit subjects for the closest scrutiny and\r\n     examination.\r\n\r\nWhoever says that in telling my story I am revealing anything which it\r\nis not fair or just to tell, or that I have not a perfect right to\r\nstate, says that which is false. I am confining myself to explaining how\r\nthe \"System\" gets its money. I do not touch upon how it spends it. If in\r\nan honorable way I could write the things that have come to me\r\nconfidentially, the \"System\" might well tremble. I confess that at times\r\nI have been tempted to depart from my code--when, for instance, soon\r\nafter the first Donohoe chapter, a man came to me and showed that he had\r\nbeen offered $5,000 to vouch for the statement--which Denis Donohoe, H.\r\nH. Rogers's right-hand man, had printed, and the insurance companies had\r\nspread broadcast--that the first ten years of Thomas W. Lawson's\r\nbusiness life were spent as an employee of Richard Canfield, the\r\nProvidence and New York gambler, and afterward as his partner. \"Give us\r\nan affidavit to that effect and we will pay you $5,000.\" To this man I\r\nsaid: \"I have never in my life been connected with any gambling-place in\r\nany way, nor had to do with gambling in any form, and only once in my\r\nlife have I set eyes on Richard Canfield. He was in the Waldorf Café one\r\nday when I was passing through. However, if I did know him I should not\r\nbe ashamed to admit it, for I consider Canfield, from what I have read\r\nof him, an angel of purity compared with any one of a score of the\r\n'System's' votaries I could name.\" The man left me, but soon after\r\nreturned. He said: \"It makes no difference whether what you say is true\r\nor not, I can now secure $10,000 for the affidavit.\" When this kind of\r\nfighting is brought to my attention, I am strongly tempted to let down\r\nthe bars.\r\n\r\n     He relates, with all the graphic art of a novelist, a\r\n     wellnigh incredible story. Chicanery, fraud, blackmail,\r\n     bribery of a legislature and of a judge, systematic pillage\r\n     of investors and of the American public.\r\n\r\nThe details I have narrated are facts, and I will prove them to be facts\r\nso all may know them.\r\n\r\n     In delving into Lawson's career--a most unwelcome task--the\r\n     writer has detected a continuity of purpose, a fixity of\r\n     design, a uniformity of method pervading his every public\r\n     act. What he is doing now, _i.e._, exposing somebody or\r\n     something, he has repeatedly done on a lesser scale in the\r\n     past; not from worthy motives, but for the sole purpose of\r\n     illegitimate pecuniary gain.\r\n\r\nYes, throughout my entire life I have pursued with a continuity of\r\npurpose that class I am pursuing to-day--the class that has taken from\r\nthe people their earnings by fraud or trick. If other proof were needed\r\nthat the men I am after have lost the discretion which made them great\r\nin the world, these foolish yarns supply it. It is well known that no\r\nman ever gets near to \"Standard Oil\" in business or socially until their\r\ndetectives have dissected his career from the cradle up. I spent years\r\nin close business relations with these men, so close that, as I will\r\nshow later, I acted as the agent not only of Rogers and Rockefeller, but\r\nof the Amalgamated Company and the City Bank.\r\n\r\n     He is at present engaged in attacking the \"System,\" as he\r\n     calls it, and the banks and the insurance companies and Wall\r\n     Street and American finance, by circulars, by\r\n     advertisements, and through the stock-market, as in the past\r\n     he has repeatedly attacked other corporations and\r\n     individuals until he obtained what he was seeking, and in\r\n     every recorded instance that thing was unearned dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the past I have repeatedly attacked individuals and corporations\r\nuntil I obtained what I sought in every case--justice for the defrauded\r\nand punishment for those who had cheated them, and in no case dollars or\r\ntheir equivalent.\r\n\r\n     In the gilded biographies of himself which, from time to\r\n     time, Mr. Lawson has caused to be written and published in\r\n     newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nMy history is well enough known. I have always lived in the open. It has\r\nnot been necessary to press-agent myself. A good deal has been printed\r\nabout me in the newspapers during the last twenty-five years, but if I\r\nhave ever sought to exploit myself before the public by means of\r\nautobiographies or journalistic puffs, and it is so proved by any\r\nreputable newspaper, may I be shown up to public scorn.\r\n\r\n     It was Mr. Stevens who defrayed the expense of a six months'\r\n     course at a Boston business college for his protégé.\r\n\r\nI have never had such a course of six months, nor of any length, nor\r\nhave I ever been inside a business college.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Stevens, who was a kindly, philanthropic man, known and\r\n     beloved by all his fellow-citizens, died years ago,\r\n     therefore he cannot dispute what Lawson tells.\r\n\r\nThe late Horace H. Stevens died not years ago, but on March 8, 1904.\r\n\r\n     Old residents of New York will recall that long before the\r\n     days of Canfield's gilded palace, and long before the era of\r\n     the present district attorney, Mr. Jerome, there was a\r\n     gambling-house known to the commercial traveller and\r\n     man-about-town as \"818 Broadway,\" and that one of the\r\n     backers of the game was William F. Waldron, or \"Billy\r\n     Waldron,\" as he was usually called. Waldron retired nearly\r\n     thirty years ago from the syndicate that controlled this\r\n     house and moved to Providence, where he interested himself\r\n     in gambling and what, for lack of a better term, may be\r\n     called the cognate industries. One of these latter was a\r\n     bucket-shop of the ordinary country town type.\r\n\r\n     This bucket-shop was confined to the tender mercies of one\r\n     \"Jo\" Lumpkin as manager. Lumpkin failed to make the business\r\n     profitable, and Waldron, after attaching $500.00 that\r\n     Lumpkin had on deposit in a bank in New York, turned him\r\n     out. In his place he installed the present loquacious\r\n     reformer of American finance, Thomas W. Lawson, or \"Billy\"\r\n     Lawson as he was then known to the gamblers, race-track\r\n     touts, and confidence men who made Providence their\r\n     head-quarters.\r\n\r\nMy readers will agree with me that such weak and feeble rot is beneath\r\nany man's attention, for even if what is here charged were true, namely,\r\nthat a young man of twenty-one had been so employed, it would have no\r\nbearing on his work twenty-six years afterward; but as I have decided to\r\ntake cognizance of this stuff, here are the facts:\r\n\r\nWhat to-day is known as the bucket-shop evil--that is, the speculation\r\nin stocks over the counter at offices conducted by brokers outside the\r\npale of the law or the Stock Exchange--did not exist at the period\r\nmentioned. This method of conducting speculation, however, had just been\r\ninvented, and many of the legitimate brokers, Stock-Exchange members,\r\nutilized the new form in their ventures. Indeed, the number of brokers\r\nand brokerage shops outside the Stock Exchange was as large, if not\r\nlarger, than that of the regular houses. At the time Donohoe treats of I\r\nwas doing considerable business for a young man, as will be evidenced by\r\nmy business card of that period:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                    THOMAS W.

At one time I had a Providence office in the building marked in\r\nthe cut in the Donohoe story, and the sign over the door was \"Thomas W.\r\nLawson & Co.\"\r\n\r\n     It was in Providence, during the heyday of the\r\n     Waldron-Lawson enterprise, that Lawson ... first met \"Jack\"\r\n     Roach, whose apparent employment now is selling diamonds on\r\n     commission to the so-called \"sporting element\" of New York,\r\n     but who is acknowledged to be Lawson's personal\r\n     representative in this city. It was there, too, that he made\r\n     the acquaintance of Herbert Gray, who subsequently conducted\r\n     a gambling-house in Boston, and who recently served as one\r\n     of Lawson's captains and managed his trotting stable. Ben\r\n     Palmer, a well-known character in State Street, who is one\r\n     of the main cog-wheels of Lawson's machine, first made\r\n     Lawson's acquaintance during this period of his career.\r\n\r\nI do know the Waldron Brothers, of Providence, who are among the oldest\r\nresidents of Rhode Island, and who, with the present United States\r\nSenator Nelson A. Aldrich, composed the great wholesale grocery house of\r\nWaldron, Wightman & Co. They did not graduate from a gambling-house on\r\nBroadway. I knew the brother referred to familiarly throughout Rhode\r\nIsland as \"Honest Bill,\" and a royal old fellow he was. I did business\r\nwith him in those days, and to any connection I ever had with him I look\r\nback with pleasure. He was then conducting a farm in the suburbs of\r\nProvidence, and in a straightforward, old-fashioned way supplying that\r\ncity with produce and poultry, and had, to the best of my knowledge, the\r\nrespect and confidence of all who knew him. I never knew of his having\r\nbeen a gambler, and had no means of knowing, as such matters were then\r\nan unknown world to me.\r\n\r\nI never, up to reading it in Donohoe's story the other day, heard of 818\r\nBroadway, curious as it may seem for a man of my experience. My\r\nknowledge of gambling has always been confined to that kind which comes\r\nunder the head of stock gambling. I had not met my present friend, John\r\nJ. Roche, of New York, at the time mentioned. I never heard of Herbert\r\nGray, of Boston, until I employed him to manage my stable in 1899. I\r\nhave known J. Benjamin Palmer all my life. We were boys together on\r\nState Street. Afterward he was the Stock-Exchange member of one of the\r\noldest banking-houses in Boston. He is still a broker on State Street.\r\n\r\n     Nothing of certainty can be learned of his career during\r\n     this period. That he sold \"base-ball\" cards (a unique kind\r\n     of playing-cards) at the Providence railroad station is\r\n     stated on credible authority; that he \"worked the trains\"\r\n     between New York and Providence; that he sold books; that he\r\n     was a hanger-on at race-tracks, has been alleged. Any or all\r\n     of these rumors may be true--or false--for whatever may be\r\n     said of Lawson, his career has undoubtedly been one of\r\n     marvellous activity in many diversified lines.\r\n\r\nI have never sold baseball playing-cards at the Providence station, nor\r\nanywhere, at this time nor any time, but I did invent the Lawson\r\nBaseball Playing-Cards, and was president of the Lawson Playing-Card\r\nCompany. I never sold books at this time nor any time, and never \"worked\r\ntrains\" at this time nor any time, although I fail to see any disgrace\r\nin such honest employment; nor had anything to do with trains in any way\r\nwhatever at this time nor any time except to ride in them. I have never\r\nbeen a hanger-on at race-tracks, and have never had anything to do with\r\na race-track of any kind other than visiting one for the first time in\r\n1899 to see my own horse, Boralma, race, and four or five times since to\r\nsee my own horses run. I desire to dwell on this especial accusation\r\nbecause these character thugs have caused it to be published throughout\r\nthe country that I am and have always been a _habitué_ of race-tracks\r\nand a plunging bettor upon races. I regret that it is my misfortune\r\nnever to have seen a horse-race until 1899, but if it can be shown that\r\nI was ever upon a race-track before that time, I will agree to stop\r\nwriting this story of \"Frenzied Finance.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1882, a concern known as the Briggs Printing Machine\r\n     Company was incorporated in Rhode Island ... to manufacture\r\n     a machine that was advertised to \"print, cut, pack, and\r\n     fasten with twine 100,000 tags per hour.\" Thomas W. Lawson\r\n     secured the job of selling agent of this company, and he\r\n     proved so successful and the advertising matter which he\r\n     wrote brought such handsome returns, that we find him in\r\n     1884 promoted to the position of manager and enjoying a\r\n     salary of $150 per month. Later he became the secretary of\r\n     the company, and very shortly thereafter, in 1887, the\r\n     enterprise collapsed, was sold out by the sheriff, and\r\n     realized little or nothing for the numerous creditors....\r\n\r\nIt is true that I was the vice-president of the Briggs Printing Machine\r\nCompany, which was organized and owned by others before I had aught to\r\ndo with it. I was induced to invest considerable money in it and to take\r\ncharge of its affairs. The Briggs Company was a close corporation. Its\r\nstock was never sold to the public, and after I left it it met with\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n     In December, 1888, the Lamson Consolidated Store-Service\r\n     Company was incorporated at Boston. Its purpose was to\r\n     exploit an invention of W. S. Lamson ... the overhead\r\n     trolley system used in department-stores for carrying cash\r\n     and parcels.... The capital stock at the beginning was\r\n     $250,000--par value of shares, $50. The company was doing\r\n     business and declaring two and a half per cent. dividends\r\n     quarterly, when Mr. Lawson stepped in and began to\r\n     manipulate the stock. The price of shares rose steadily to\r\n     122. Under the influence of speculative excitement the\r\n     directors increased the capital stock to $1,000,000, then to\r\n     $4,000,000. Mr. Lawson boomed the stock on the basis of a\r\n     report, totally destitute of truth, that an English\r\n     syndicate was about to purchase a controlling interest in\r\n     the company. Having unloaded all the shares at his disposal\r\n     on the uproad to 122, Mr. Lawson suddenly one morning awoke\r\n     to a realization of the fact that Lamson Store-Service\r\n     shares possessed absolutely no value, and he at once took\r\n     the public, as is his custom, into his confidence. In\r\n     circulars, by advertisements, and by cunningly contrived\r\n     \"news\" items he insistently dinned into the public ear that\r\n     Lamson shares were valueless. The result was as well might\r\n     be imagined. The stock declined to 30, whereupon Lawson\r\n     bought it back and then and there made his first grand\r\n     _coup_. It is said that first and last he realized $250,000\r\n     from the Lamson shareholders.\r\n\r\nI did \"Lawsonize\" the Lamson Store-Service Company, just as I am at the\r\npresent time \"Lawsonizing\" the \"Standard-Oil\"-Amalgamated-City-Bank\r\ncrowd. The Lamson Store-Service Company, with $4,000,000 capital, was\r\nblunderbussing all who dared oppose it--all who refused to be bulldozed\r\ninto consolidating with it. It was the most vicious exponent of the\r\n\"Trust\" methods I had ever met up to that time. Its arrogance, audacity,\r\nand crimes were the themes of the newspapers and courts of the day. A\r\nmost casual investigation of the newspaper files, particularly in Osgood\r\n_vs._ Lamson, and The New York Store-Service Company _vs._ Lamson, will\r\nshow a state of corporation assassination equal to that of the \"Standard\r\nOil,\" only on a smaller scale, of course. Perjury, bribery, and even\r\nmurder will be found openly charged and in some cases proved. At the\r\nheight of the sensational career of the Lamson Company it ran into one\r\nof my corporations, The Lawson Manufacturing Company, and started in to\r\n\"do me up\" or compel a consolidation, and--well, I gave it battle. The\r\nfollowing circular to the stockholders will show how the battle\r\nstarted:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I deem it my duty to say to you, as a\r\n     shareholder of the Lamson Store-Service Company, that your\r\n     Mr. Lamson and his agents have opened up on my company, and\r\n     with their usual criminal methods are endeavoring to ruin\r\n     us. This circular is to inform you that I have this day\r\n     given notice to each of your officers and directors that, in\r\n     three days from to-day, if they have not stopped their dirty\r\n     work and taken their hands off my company, they will take\r\n     the consequences. I do not pretend to be able to meet them\r\n     on the fighting grounds of the courts, for I know too well\r\n     their power of corruption and jury-buying, but I assure you\r\n     I have other ways by which I can stop them, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIf Donohoe had desired to deal with facts, he could not have missed the\r\ndetails of this story, of which the papers at the time were full. It was\r\na fight which would have warmed the heart-cockles of an embalmed warrior\r\nof the catacombs. Lamson stock was selling at 62, the highest price it\r\never attained, not 122, as this numskull states. When I began operations\r\nI slaughtered it and the reputation of Lamson and his associates; and in\r\nthe midst of the fight, when the shares were down to 18, or perhaps 14,\r\na great public meeting of stockholders--there were a whole lot of\r\nthem--was called in the city of Lowell, and, amid fiery speeches, Lamson\r\nwas told to choose between refuting my charges of fraud and being\r\ndeposed from the presidency of the institution. Lamson attempted\r\nexplanations, but the hard-headed stockholders did what the Amalgamated\r\nstockholders will some time do, passed resolutions that Lamson must\r\npunish me for libel or that they would punish him. The gathering then\r\nadjourned to a future date, at which Lamson was to report what action he\r\nhad taken to punish me for my crimes. The next step was interesting, and\r\nbears on an accusation I have seen mentioned frequently of late. I had,\r\nwhen I began my fight, laid before Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York\r\n_World_, the dastardly crimes of which the company had been guilty, and\r\nwas even then engaged in committing, and he had said: \"Damnable! I will\r\naid you in exposing them.\" And he did. Day after day there were\r\nbroadsides in the _World_ relentlessly denouncing the rascalities of the\r\nLamson outfit. These finally stirred them to action. One day I received\r\nword that some trickery was being put up in the district attorney's\r\noffice in New York. A few days later there appeared at my office in\r\nBoston a police officer from New York and three of our head Boston\r\npolice officers. They said to me: \"We regret, Mr. Lawson, but we must\r\ntake your secretary, Mr. William L. Vinal, back to New York, as he has\r\nbeen indicted for spreading false reports.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has any one else been indicted?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" they replied, \"you and some of the _World_ people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Vinal has done nothing but obey my orders,\" I said. \"Why don't you\r\ntake me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no orders to,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nI saw the game and sent word to the Governor of Massachusetts, who\r\npromptly told the combination: \"Go slow, gentlemen. Remember you are not\r\nin New York now, but in Massachusetts.\" He ordered a public trial.\r\nWithin two hours from the time they laid hands on my secretary I brought\r\nsuit in his name for false arrest against the officers who were trying\r\nto arrest him, and grabbed the New York official before he could skip\r\nout of town. Then I went to see the Lamson crowd and we had it out. They\r\nbegged that I allow Vinal to go to New York, just to vindicate them, in\r\nwhich circumstances he would be allowed to return on the next train, and\r\nthe case would never be heard of again. If I would consent, they would\r\nagree to a reorganization of the company and the dropping out of Lamson.\r\nI showed them that they had gone too far, that I had damaging\r\ninformation as to how they had secured the indictment, and that now they\r\nmust take the consequences.\r\n\r\nI took the \"midnight\" for New York, and in the morning was at\r\nDistrict-Attorney Fellows's office. I dared him to arrest me or the\r\nofficers of the _World_. He replied: \"I don't want you, Lawson. I cannot\r\nand won't help you advertise your fight.\" It proving impossible to get\r\nup any excitement in New York, I returned to Boston, and the extradition\r\nproceedings furnished a most sensational trial. The cause was bitterly\r\nfought. The lawyers even came to blows in the governor's chamber.\r\nFinally, when Governor Brackett had all the facts before him, he said:\r\n\"You cannot work your dirty tricks on me,\" and he entered a vigorous\r\nrefusal of the application for Mr. Vinal's extradition. This case\r\nestablished precedents for all such proceedings since.\r\n\r\nThe fight won, pressure was brought to bear on me to let up on the\r\nLamson outfit and call off further proceedings. For some time I\r\npersistently refused to do so, as I was determined to contest the\r\nconstitutionality of the law. Finally, however, on condition that Lamson\r\nshould be thrown out, the management of the company reorganized, its\r\ncriminal methods abandoned, and all records and trace of the indictment\r\nagainst myself and the others removed from the district attorney's\r\nbooks, I consented.\r\n\r\nThis is the history of how I \"Lawsonized\" the Lamson Store-Service\r\nCompany, and if there is anything I have ever done that was good to do\r\nand well worth doing, this was it. I am just as proud of my work here as\r\nof what I did in the General Electric fight upon which I have already\r\ntouched. In the Lamson reorganization I was offered all sorts of good\r\nthings, but I refused, as I always have in such affairs, to benefit in\r\nany way but the open and fair one where I go into the open market and\r\nstake my money against that of my opponents on my ability to prove I am\r\nright. The facts here are of legal record. Following is the\r\nDonohoe-Rogers version. The mendacity is obvious:\r\n\r\n     Among the unfortunate Lamson-Service stockholders were\r\n     numbered several aggressive people of the old-fashioned\r\n     kind, who resented Mr. Lawson's peculiar way of doing\r\n     things. These submitted, in 1892, to the grand jury of the\r\n     city of New York a sheaf of Lawsonian literature, comprising\r\n     his scandalous attacks on the company's securities. The\r\n     grand jury indicted Thomas W. Lawson, and Colonel John R.\r\n     Fellows, the district attorney, and his assistants, Francis\r\n     L. Wellman and Mr. Lindsay, went to Boston to try to have\r\n     Lawson extradited. The Governor of Massachusetts came to\r\n     Lawson's rescue in the nick of time and declined to honor\r\n     the request of the Governor of New York for his extradition;\r\n     but for years thereafter the future author of \"Frenzied\r\n     Finance\" made his trips to this money-centre incognito.\r\n\r\n     THE GRAND RIVERS ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\n     In 1890 the entire country rang with the fame of Grand\r\n     Rivers, and it was Thomas W. Lawson, of Boston, who pulled\r\n     the bell-rope.... The scheme, as may be deduced herefrom,\r\n     was a most comprehensive one. The development of the\r\n     \"marvellous deposit of coal and iron,\" which had been\r\n     discovered upon the property by Mr. Lawson, one day while\r\n     seated in his revolving chair in his State Street office,\r\n     furnished the basis for the incorporation of the Furnaces\r\n     Company. After $2,000,000 had been \"expended,\" the clamor of\r\n     the stockholders caused the company actually to build\r\n     several furnaces. They were erected and stood idle, with\r\n     nothing to feed them. The whole scheme collapsed in 1892.\r\n     The stockholders lost every dollar of their investment....\r\n\r\n     In this, his fourth financial venture, Mr. Lawson did but\r\n     repeat his former experiences--except, in this case, the\r\n     loss sustained by those who reposed confidence in his\r\n     promises was heavier than in any of his prior undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky experience is one of the pleasantest memories of my life.\r\nMeasured by dollars and cents it was expensive but was well worth it, as\r\nthe young man remarked who broke his arm by being thrown from his horse\r\ninto the lap of his future wife. It makes a long story, and I shall only\r\ntouch on the leading facts concerning it by way of showing the desperate\r\nstraits my enemies are put to in their efforts to discredit my career.\r\n\r\nMy present brokers, Messrs. Brown, Riley & Co., one of the oldest and\r\nlargest Boston and New York Stock Exchange houses, had floated the Grand\r\nRivers enterprise for some of their wealthy clients. It was an iron,\r\ncoal, and furnace proposition, and before I ever heard of it, it had\r\nbeen bought and paid for, and enormous furnaces were under way. It was a\r\nclose corporation. After a very large amount of money--in the\r\nmillions--had gone into the property, I was induced to take the\r\nexecutive management, and also I put in a very large amount of my own\r\nmoney. My work was to be that of business director, for I did not know\r\nan iron or a coal mine from an alabaster ledge in the lunar spheres, and\r\nnot half as much about an iron smelter as I did about converting\r\nwhiskers into mermaid's tresses. However, one of the greatest iron men\r\nin New England, Aretas Blood, president of the Manchester Locomotive\r\nWorks, and of the Nashua Steel and Iron Company, was at the head of the\r\nenterprise, which apparently safeguarded it. Well, it turned out that\r\nthere was no iron in the mines--at least not enough to pay for\r\nextraction, and the investment simply disappeared. I lost a very large\r\namount--at least, a very large amount for me--but I had to show for it\r\nthe love and friendship and respect of the inhabitants of one of the\r\nfairest places on the earth--a place where brave men and lovely women\r\nlive in peace and comfort in the knowledge of their own fearless, simple\r\nhonesty, and their hatred of shams and trickery--in absolute ignorance\r\nof frenzied financiers and the \"System's\" votaries.\r\n\r\nThe history of Grand Rivers is an open book. There is no secret about my\r\nconnection with the enterprise. It was a straight and proper venture.\r\nThe men who are my brokers of to-day fathered it, and they are men of\r\nhonor, probity, and responsibility, who since my first year in business\r\nin 1870 have been my close business associates and personal friends. Why\r\ndo not Donohoe and his breed of gutter-rooters, when seeking information\r\nabout me, ask such men as these for facts about my life?--they know what\r\nevery hour of it has been. Strange as it may seem to such vampires, the\r\nmen I began to do business with when I was a boy I am doing business\r\nwith to-day, and they are my associates and friends.\r\n\r\nI postponed until the last moment writing this article in order that I\r\nmight be able to diagnose the \"System's\" attack on me. The first of the\r\nwidely advertised series was such a foolish and asinine thing as to be\r\nunworthy of notice, and I desired to see how much further the second\r\nwould go. In the former it was charged that I was writing my articles\r\nsolely for the purpose of securing stock-market profits and compelling\r\nthe \"System\" to settle; in other words, that I was attempting to\r\nblackmail them; that I had no honorable motives in writing my story, and\r\nhad no remedy of any kind in mind; that in the recent panic I had made a\r\nmillion and a quarter of dollars; that I had secured President\r\nRoosevelt's message eight days before it was published; that I had\r\nadvertised on November 29th, unqualifiedly advising all to purchase\r\nAmalgamated, and that on December 6th I had advertised advising all to\r\nsell. It is true that I did advise the public to sell, but that in my\r\nadvertisement of November 29th I advised the people to buy Amalgamated\r\nI positively deny. I carefully avoided doing so. The other statements\r\nare equally false, and were made with a full knowledge of their falsity.\r\n\r\nThe incidents in my career about which I have here set forth the facts\r\nare not secret. All the things I have stated are fully susceptible of\r\nproof. For another instant let me take the assertion that my motive in\r\nthis crusade is personal gain through stock-jobbery, and that I have no\r\naim or end in view other than that. Well, I can to-day show the Remedy\r\nto which I have alluded so often, and which when I worked it out in 1893\r\nI had printed with full detail. It is in my vault now under lock and\r\nkey. In the year 1894, in London, I laid a copy of this document before\r\nJoseph Pulitzer of the New York _World_. Remember, this was a year\r\nbefore I met H. H. Rogers or any of the \"Standard Oil\" party.\r\n\r\nSince Donohoe began his latest series of attacks I have had scores of\r\nletters commenting on them. A significant verdict on what the man is\r\naccomplishing is the following:\r\n\r\n     BUFFALO, N. Y., January 23, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I herewith enclose you copy of a letter just\r\n     sent to Mr. Donohoe, also to the editor of ----\r\n\r\n     Yours respectfully,\r\n         ----\r\n\r\n(COPY)\r\n\r\n     January 23, 1905.\r\n\r\n     MR. DENIS DONOHOE,\r\n\r\n     Financial Editor, New York _Commercial_, New York City.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: With considerable pleasure, satisfaction, and\r\n     conviction, I have carefully read all the articles on\r\n     \"Frenzied Finance,\" by Mr. Lawson, and from my limited\r\n     knowledge of affairs, gained by fifteen years of active\r\n     life, am of the opinion that he has been telling facts,\r\n     although at times they are clothed in the language of a\r\n     writer of fiction.\r\n\r\n     I have been waiting and confidently expecting, during the\r\n     past six months, that some able, honest, unbiassed, and\r\n     free-handed man would take up the discussion against Mr.\r\n     Lawson, and in this way aid the people in viewing the entire\r\n     subject with all possible side-lights, so that when public\r\n     opinion shall be finally formed, as surely it will be in the\r\n     future, it may be as nearly right as possible and only the\r\n     guilty suffer. It was, therefore, with a high degree of\r\n     exultation that I purchased ---- of January 19th, upon the\r\n     first page of which in bold type appears: \"Lawson\r\n     Answered--the Truth About Frenzied Finance.\" At the sight of\r\n     these words I said in almost audible tones: \"Now we shall\r\n     hear the other side, or at least learn what Mr. Lawson has\r\n     omitted, if anything.\"\r\n\r\n     I have just finished reading your article in said issue of\r\n     ----, and as you now pose as a public writer and benefactor,\r\n     you of course will welcome frank, honest criticism. After\r\n     reading and rereading your said article, I am, against my\r\n     desire, forced to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n     1. You are either one of the \"System\" or are hired by it.\r\n\r\n     2. This article of yours was prepared for the purposes of\r\n     making two points: (a) Working on the sentiment and passions\r\n     of the weak, and the women; and (b) diverting public\r\n     attention and opinion from the real facts at issue, by\r\n     attacking Mr. Lawson's personal character, which is not up\r\n     for discussion.\r\n\r\n     3. Your article is full of high-sounding declarations, and\r\n     void of either logic or common sense.\r\n\r\n     4. In your endeavor to express the wishes of the prejudiced\r\n     and biassed, you are undoubtedly dishonest with yourself\r\n     without deceiving the public.\r\n\r\n     5. Your article lacks the ring that carries conviction,\r\n     either as to your sincerity or the truthfulness of the\r\n     statements you make.\r\n\r\n     6. The article indicates that you are vainly trying to ape\r\n     Mr. Lawson's style.\r\n\r\n     Yours respectfully,\r\n         E. G. MANSFIELD,\r\n             Attorney-at-law.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Donohoe outburst there came innumerable letters, of which\r\nthis is a good sample:\r\n\r\n     TACOMA, WASH., February 14, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: It would be greatly appreciated by at least one\r\n     of your readers if you would furnish the great and only\r\n     Donohoe the details of some really scandalous epoch of your\r\n     past. It has been stated many times that one man cannot make\r\n     a million dollars and do it honestly, so we must assume you\r\n     have done some \"things\" in your past. We have a very high\r\n     regard out West for the works of Mr. Dooley and Mark Twain,\r\n     and also are regular subscribers of _Puck_ and _Judge_, and\r\n     we don't want to see these noted writers and periodicals\r\n     unseated, even for the time being, by Mr. Donohoe.\r\n\r\n     Therefore we ask you to give him some tip from which he can\r\n     work out something serious, so he can make a statement that\r\n     is not \"reported,\" or the deduction of which does not\r\n     require Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n     His work of \"dissecting\" so far reminds us of the work of a\r\n     six months' student of a medical college on a Tom cat (no\r\n     pun meant).\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n         L. H. M.\r\n\r\nI answered as follows:\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_: Your request is similar to that of a hundred other\r\ncorrespondents. I regret I can do nothing to help out. Donohoe's trouble\r\nis, he is short of facts, so \"short\" that he seems to me completely\r\n\"cornered.\" I am \"long of\" them, as you and all my other readers will\r\nadmit before I am through my story, but my facts are not the kind\r\nDonohoe can use, or I would willingly let him have a few to assist him\r\nout of his present predicament.\r\n\r\nDonohoe's employers, Rogers and the \"Standard Oil,\" knew before they put\r\nhim on to his present \"job\" that my life was a peculiarly and unusually\r\nopen one--one that had absolutely no dark or covered corner in it; they\r\nknew it not only because all men in my walks of life know it, but\r\nbecause they had investigated it with their unerring search-light. Most\r\nmen who have ever been on the inside of \"Standard Oil\" know that no man\r\nwith a bad record could do business, much less have an intimate\r\nrelation, with Rogers and Rockefeller for nine seconds; and my\r\nconnection extended over nine years.\r\n\r\nThe tone of my correspondence during the year was not by any means\r\naltogether friendly. The writer of the following letter presented his\r\nconclusions straight from the shoulder and I was equally direct in my\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n     Personal.\r\n\r\n     GAINESVILLE, FLA., February 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n     MR. THOMAS W. LAWSON, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: Pardon my \"buttin' in\"--seems I must say\r\n     something.\r\n\r\n     If what Donohoe says about your Trinity Copper Company is\r\n     true, it would seem you ought to stop throwing mud at the\r\n     Standard Oil crowd, for you are no better than are they, and\r\n     they are known thieves and robbers. While you may be telling\r\n     the truth about the other fellow, yet the fact of your\r\n     telling it does not set well on the stomach of those who\r\n     read both sides of the story. Seems to me it's \"dog eat dog\"\r\n     until every one is disgusted.\r\n\r\n     Why don't you come down to business and give the readers of\r\n     _Everybody's_ something wholesome to digest and plenty of\r\n     it? The way it comes now, we are over our hunger before the\r\n     next issue shows up, and, in the meantime, your friend has\r\n     converted many to the thought that you are worse than the\r\n     Standard Oil crowd.\r\n\r\n     Won't you please answer, in the next issue of _Everybody's_,\r\n     if you made your money--your fortune, HONESTLY, or did you\r\n     \"do others\" for fear they would \"do you\"? I am inclined to\r\n     think you are as big a \"grafter\" as ever came down the pike,\r\n     even though you may be telling on the other fellow--turning\r\n     State's evidence.\r\n\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n         ----\r\n\r\nYou ask why I do not get down to business. You won't mind my telling you\r\nthe principal reason is that it is _I_ who am writing \"Frenzied\r\nFinance,\" not you nor any of your kind, and that I propose to decide\r\nwhen it is time to get down to business. If in the meantime there is any\r\none else who can do the job I have cut out better than I, why, none will\r\nbe better pleased than myself. Indeed, I will gladly contribute as a\r\nreward to my successor double the many thousands of dollars I am paying\r\neach month to get this work of mine properly before the people.\r\n\r\nWhat Donohoe says of my Trinity Copper is not only absolutely false, but\r\nhas over and over again been demonstrated to be so. The actual facts\r\nregarding that property have been printed time and again in reputable\r\nBoston newspapers, and casual inquiry will obtain you the full details.\r\nIn addition, practically everything which Donohoe, the hired mouthpiece\r\nof \"Standard Oil\" and the \"System,\" has said is absolutely untrue and\r\nmade from whole cloth. When I say this I cover all criticism which has\r\nbeen made upon me or my work by \"Standard Oil\" or the \"System,\" for this\r\ncharacter thug has utilized every dirty slander which my enemies ever\r\ninvented and put into circulation.\r\n\r\nDid I make my fortune honestly, you ask? and I answer: In thirty-six\r\nyears of active business life, very active, embracing transactions\r\nthrough which I have passed from poverty to wealth and back again from\r\nriches to poverty, and in which I might easily have retained the riches\r\nby sacrificing a principle, I have never once in all these years and in\r\nall these transactions done a wrong to man, woman, or child, nor taken\r\nfrom man, woman, or child a dollar unfairly, much less dishonestly.\r\nRather a remarkable record, you will say, for one who has made millions\r\nin the stock business. But I should not be broadly honest if I did not\r\nadd the modification that these millions of dollars were made in the\r\nopen stock-market, by methods which in the open stock-market are called\r\nfair and honest; that is, I have played the game according to the rules,\r\nand the \"other fellow\" has had equal chance with me and might have done\r\nanything I ever did. If, however, business were conducted as it should\r\nbe and as it will be after my \"Remedy\" has reformed present conditions,\r\nsuch methods will net those using them only thousands where I have\r\ngained millions.\r\n\r\nYou add that you are inclined to think I am a \"grafter.\" In reply I can\r\nonly say you would not dare--and I don't know your size, color, or\r\nlength of trigger-finger--to say it in my presence, though of course, it\r\nis absolutely immaterial what you or your kind think of me or my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAWSON PANIC\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen months in which \"Frenzied Finance\" has been before\r\nthe public, history has been made at a stiff pace. Next to the insurance\r\nrevelations which are still in process of deliverance, the most striking\r\ndemonstration of the period has been the flurry in stocks which was\r\nspoken of as the Lawson panic. In the February, 1905, issue of\r\n_Everybody's Magazine_ I dealt with the performance and its attendant\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nWithout undue vaunting, I may say that my explanation of the mysteries\r\nof modern finance has not been without immediate profit to the public.\r\nThe people, accustomed to invest their money in the legitimate\r\nsecurities of the country, had time and again lost hundreds of millions\r\nwithout dreaming that they had been as ruthlessly robbed as though held\r\nup at a pistol-point by a highwayman. They imagined that the great\r\ncapitalists whose names were emblazoned in the press throughout the\r\nland, and who managed the banks and trust companies and insurance\r\ncorporations to which their savings were intrusted, were noble and\r\npublic-spirited gentlemen of the highest moral principles and of\r\nabsolute integrity. They know to-day that many of them are reckless and\r\ngreedy stock gamblers, incessantly dickering with the machinery of\r\nfinance for their own private enrichment.\r\n\r\nI have stripped the veil from these hypocrites and exposed to all the\r\nworld their soulless rapacity. I have let the light of heaven into the\r\ndim recesses of Wall Street in which these buccaneers of commerce\r\nconcocted their plots. I have done more than this: I have nipped in the\r\nbud the newest conspiracy for the entanglement of the public--the great\r\n\"bull\" market which was organized late in 1904 by the chief votaries of\r\nthe \"System,\" to harvest a new crop of profits on the securities they\r\nhad laid in during their last raid. In other words, I have treated Wall\r\nStreet to a dose of its own medicine.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of December the newspapers devoted considerable space\r\nto the doings of the stock-market in connection with the episode to\r\nwhich I refer. I use the word \"episode\" purposely, for I warn my readers\r\nthat it was but one of a series of disturbances which must occur before\r\nthe grasp of the pirates on the great financial interests of this\r\ncountry can be shaken off. David slew Goliath with one pebble from his\r\nsling, but the giant \"System,\" intrenched in the stoutest citadel ever\r\nconstructed, and armored in gold and riven steel, will yield to no mere\r\ncall for surrender. My own part I have cheerfully taken with no\r\ndelusions as to the difficulties of the contest. He who interferes\r\nbetween the lamb and the wolf is likely to provoke the wrath of the\r\nwolf, and I have done worse, for have I not come between the lions of\r\nfinance and their willing prey?\r\n\r\nIt is worth while here to rehearse the steps of this first disturbance,\r\nbecause it constitutes part of a movement destined to wield a tremendous\r\ninfluence in this country's history. While my revelations of the methods\r\nof the \"System\" were circulating throughout these United States, the\r\n\"System\" was engaged at its old trick of inflating the prices of its\r\nfavorite stocks and bonds and spreading its nets for another gigantic\r\nplundering of the people. In the stock-market and in the highways and\r\nby-ways and resting-places of finance nothing was heard for months but\r\nfairy tales of great earnings of railroads and industrials, fairy tales\r\nof new ore in old mines, fairy tales of great financial forces\r\nconverging toward colossal combinations.\r\n\r\nThese are the lures of the \"System's\" hirelings, the decoy calls of the\r\nmarket tout and the financial tipster whose part it is to mould opinion\r\nand urge the people to the shambles. Before my eyes, with a blind and\r\naudacious defiance of my warnings, the old, old game was rigged in full\r\nview of the audience and the old players began their venerable antics.\r\nIn the meantime the \"System\" attended to its own rôle in the\r\nconspiracy--supplying out of its banks and trust companies the public's\r\nmoney for the gamblers to make the game with. Then began the artful\r\nprocess of working up the market; stocks gradually climbed higher and\r\nhigher. Amalgamated ascended from the forties into the fifties and the\r\nsixties and even into the eighties; steel assumed the appearance of life\r\nand grew from ten slowly upward into the twenties and thirties. Every\r\nday in the Stock Exchange hundreds of thousands of shares changed hands\r\nback and forth among the professionals who lustily played their parts in\r\nthis financial melodrama. The good old myths of great fortunes made by\r\nlucky investors began to reappear in the papers. Sales increased; values\r\njumped rather than climbed. The trap was set; the market made. The wily\r\nmanipulators rubbed their hands gleefully. The public began to bite, to\r\nbuy. It was then only a matter of sizing up the wool crop before\r\nbeginning the shearing.\r\n\r\nBefore I detail the steps I took to spring its own trap on the \"System,\"\r\nI should explain that this market was purely an artificial one. The\r\nimmense advance of prices was not brought about by any honest methods or\r\nlegitimate causes. The \"System's\" votaries had enormous quantities of\r\nstocks--millions upon millions of shares, bought when the people during\r\nthe past two years were compelled to throw them overboard at slaughter\r\nprices. By employing one of the oldest swindling devices known to\r\nfinance,[21] they could bid prices to any figure they desired. Honest\r\nfinancial writers called attention each week to the tactics of the\r\nmanipulators and declared the high quotations unjustifiable and\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nAt the stage of the game that I felt sure immediately preceded the\r\nunloading signal, I determined to test whether the people had really\r\ndigested as well as absorbed the cold facts I had been ladling out to\r\nthem in my story of \"Frenzied Finance\"--whether they had grown wise\r\nenough to heed a warning. So on Monday, December 5th, I carefully\r\nprepared the following advertisement, which was published Tuesday\r\nmorning in the great papers of the great cities of this country and\r\nlater in Europe.\r\n\r\n     AMALGAMATED STOCKHOLDERS--WARNING\r\n\r\n     From the creation of Amalgamated I have continuously\r\n     believed in its worth and constantly advocated the purchase\r\n     of its stock.\r\n\r\n     Henry H. Rogers personally negotiated with Marcus Daly for\r\n     the properties which went to make up the Amalgamated\r\n     Company.\r\n\r\n     Henry H. Rogers alone knew absolutely their values.\r\n\r\n     Henry H. Rogers's associates took his word for them.\r\n\r\n     While they cost Messrs. Rogers, Rockefeller, and associates\r\n     only $39,000,000, we all believed they were worth more than\r\n     the $75,000,000 at which they were sold to the public.\r\n\r\n     Shortly after the public flotation at $100 per share, the\r\n     stock dropped to 75. I did all in my power to prevent the\r\n     decline, losing millions in the effort, but I retained my\r\n     faith in the real worth of the property.\r\n\r\n     Some of the insiders made millions; the public was fleeced\r\n     of millions.\r\n\r\n     I still refused to be discouraged. I urged Messrs. Rogers\r\n     and Rockefeller to make good their promises made through me\r\n     to the public. Finally they consented. The stock advanced\r\n     until it sold at 130.\r\n\r\n     At the highest price I was still buying and advising its\r\n     purchase. Then there came the awful slump which slid the\r\n     stock down to 33. I lost enormously; insiders made vast\r\n     profits. The public was again fleeced.\r\n\r\n     At 33 I began a new campaign to induce my followers and the\r\n     public to buy. As a result there were purchased by hundreds\r\n     of people all over the country directly and indirectly\r\n     through me, rising 260,000 shares, at an average of 40 to\r\n     42, and probably hundreds of thousands more which I could\r\n     not trace.\r\n\r\n     This campaign I have prosecuted incessantly up to the\r\n     present time, until now I estimate the public holds\r\n     1,000,000 shares, 700,000 of which show at to-day's price,\r\n     82, a profit of $28,000,000.\r\n\r\n     When my story, \"Frenzied Finance,\" began, I advertised that\r\n     it could do no damage to Amalgamated stock, but would help\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Hoping to divert the dangerous disclosures I threatened, the\r\n     leading attorney of Messrs. Rogers and Rockefeller asked for\r\n     a conference. At it he demanded of me what I expected to\r\n     accomplish. I replied: \"One thing, at least--to put the\r\n     price of Amalgamated back to 100, that those unfortunates\r\n     who still retain their stock may recover their money.\"\r\n\r\n     Then the secret was revealed to me that Amalgamated was not\r\n     worth anything like the price at which it had been sold to\r\n     the public. I said: \"How can this be?\"\r\n\r\n     He answered: \"Mr. Rogers knows for a certainty that Marcus\r\n     Daly deceived him about the worth of the properties.\"\r\n\r\n     I had great faith in this attorney. He was sincere in what\r\n     he said; his knowledge and relations were such he could not\r\n     have been deceived, and his special information about this\r\n     property was such that he could speak in the first person. I\r\n     believed him. Soon afterward another official of Amalgamated\r\n     confirmed his statements.\r\n\r\n     When I received this information my dilemma was a terrible\r\n     one. If I gave it to my following they would at once throw\r\n     over their stock, probably at a great loss. I waited. Sooner\r\n     or later I knew these men would get behind the market, push\r\n     up the prices of the stocks they had gathered in at bottom\r\n     figures, and, when the moment was ripe, again unload on the\r\n     public.\r\n\r\n     The market \"came in.\" I did all in my power to assist in\r\n     raising the price of Amalgamated.\r\n\r\n     To-day's situation is the same as that of 1901.\r\n\r\n     \"Frenzied finance\" stock gamblers have accumulated immense\r\n     lines of Amalgamated. The same sensational rumors of a great\r\n     rise to come flood Wall and State streets as in 1901. They\r\n     have asked me to join in creating a wild market upon which\r\n     all the Amalgamated taken in at lower prices may be turned\r\n     out upon the public.\r\n\r\n     It would be millions in my pocket to assist, but----\r\n\r\n     I see the handwriting on the wall which the \"frenzied\r\n     financiers\" of Wall Street do not yet see. It reads:\r\n\r\n     \"The people will not stand plundering any longer.\"\r\n\r\n     And I have decided.\r\n\r\n     I advise every stockholder of Amalgamated stock to sell his\r\n     holdings at once before another crash comes. Another slump\r\n     may carry it to 33 again, or lower.\r\n\r\n     It may go higher, but this is no affair of mine. From the\r\n     moment of the publication of this notice all those who have\r\n     looked to me for advice must relieve me of further\r\n     responsibility.\r\n\r\n     As the people who look to me for advice are scattered all\r\n     over this country, I know of no other way than this to\r\n     simultaneously notify them of what I have learned.\r\n\r\n     If the powerful people who manage and control Amalgamated,\r\n     and who, after selling it to the public at $100 a share,\r\n     allowed it to sink to $75, and after it had advanced to 130,\r\n     smashed it to 33, regardless of their sacred promise to me\r\n     and the public through me, now reveal to me that it is not\r\n     worth over 45, it is inevitable that if they are honest in\r\n     what they say, the stock must go there of its own weight. If\r\n     they are not honest, they will put it there anyway, and\r\n     lower still.\r\n\r\n     I would have waited until the reckless speculators who are\r\n     now manipulating the market had put the stock higher, but I\r\n     did not dare. During the past two days I have detected\r\n     unmistakable signs that the vultures are gathering for the\r\n     feast.\r\n\r\n     In the past I have told what I thought I knew about\r\n     Amalgamated; from to-day I shall tell what the men who\r\n     control and manage Amalgamated say they have found out about\r\n     it. No stockholder should, after this fair notice, object or\r\n     accuse me of trying to injure the property, even though I be\r\n     compelled to begin court proceedings based on this\r\n     information so lately revealed to me.\r\n\r\n     This advertisement and my mailed notices will appear in New\r\n     York and Boston, Tuesday, December 6th; in the Eastern and\r\n     middle portions of the United States Wednesday, and the\r\n     balance of the country, Canada and Europe Thursday, and I\r\n     shall wait until Friday, that all may have ample time to\r\n     dispose of their stock, if they care to, before making my\r\n     next move.\r\n\r\n     Every holder of Amalgamated must keep before his eyes this\r\n     one tremendous fact: His property is now absolutely at the\r\n     mercy of men who have the market in the hollow of their\r\n     hands, and who in the past have raised this stock to the\r\n     highest and then dropped it to the lowest without heed or\r\n     concern but for their own pockets.\r\n\r\n     COPPER RANGE\r\n\r\n     Since Copper Range Consolidated sold at 12 I have advised\r\n     its purchase. To-day it sells at 70. All who have followed\r\n     my advice have made immense profits.\r\n\r\n     Copper Range has 385,000 shares; Amalgamated 1,550,000.\r\n\r\n     Copper Range is a new property at Lake Superior, consisting\r\n     of three immense mines and a railroad, with the latest and\r\n     most complete plant in the world, including its own\r\n     smelters. It is the largest and richest copper mine\r\n     discovered and developed in the past twenty years. It is\r\n     producing now 40,000,000 pounds of copper annually, and will\r\n     in the near future become the largest producer in the world.\r\n\r\n     Amalgamated pays 2 per cent. in dividends. Copper Range will\r\n     pay 6 per cent. in the coming year, and continue to\r\n     increase, to what limit no man can tell. If the present\r\n     market for copper, the metal, holds at 15 cents, and the\r\n     best judges think it will probably go higher, Amalgamated\r\n     should increase its dividends to 4 or 6, but with 15-cent\r\n     metal Copper Range will earn and pay 8, 10, and 12 per\r\n     cent., and upward.\r\n\r\n     The curse of Amalgamated has been \"Standard Oil\" management.\r\n     Copper Range has been, and is, directed and controlled by\r\n     representative Boston copper men, who seek their profits in\r\n     the mine and not in the stock-market.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON.\r\n     BOSTON, December 6, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe result of this announcement proved that my message had not fallen on\r\nstony places, but had been accepted by the public in the spirit of its\r\ngiving. All Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday the people sold their\r\nstocks to the \"System's\" votaries at the falsely inflated prices these\r\ngentry had forced for their own plundering purposes. Instead of\r\ngathering in the savings of the toilers, the \"System\" had to part with\r\nsome of its wad. For once the people got the money and the \"System\" had\r\nthe stocks. Under the stress of tremendous selling the price of\r\n\"Amalgamated\" was shattered. Other frenzied finance stocks declined in\r\nsympathy. The power of publicity had been triumphantly vindicated and\r\nthe cries of frenzied financiers, their mouths full of their own\r\nfish-hooks, resounded through the land.\r\n\r\nThat this condition would be allowed to prevail long, I knew was\r\nimprobable. The \"System's\" leading votaries got together and organized\r\nto stop the frightful decline in prices. The old cuttle-fish methods\r\nwere at once resorted to--a campaign of falsehood, deception, and\r\ntrickery began. Lest the people should realize that it was their power\r\nwhich had wrought such havoc, the touts and tipsters shouted in chorus\r\nthat the slaughter of prices was the work of the \"System\" itself, and\r\nthat I was secretly in league with the \"System\" against the public;\r\nthat, the public having been robbed of its stocks, prices would advance\r\nwith an extra bound. Scores of millions were drawn from the banks and\r\ntrust companies to stay the slump. Under the influence of all this\r\nindustry and clamor the market began to boil again; prices recovered,\r\nand the people, confused and bewildered, were once more about to be\r\nentrapped. A sharp advance was followed by a cry from the votaries that\r\nI was a trickster and that what had been in reality the most notable\r\ndemonstration of \"the people's strength\" ever given was only another\r\nevidence of the \"System's\" infallibility. If this deceit had prevailed,\r\nthe task I have undertaken of enlightening the public would have had a\r\nsetback. Relying on my previous work, I put forth the following\r\nannouncement Monday morning, December 12th, and confidently awaited\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n     INVESTORS AND SPECULATORS--WARNING!\r\n\r\n     For six months through my story, \"Frenzied Finance,\" in\r\n     _Everybody's Magazine_, I have been educating the people to\r\n     the terrible condition existing to-day in America--the\r\n     people are plundered of their savings by a few men through\r\n     the working of the \"System.\"\r\n\r\n     After a close study for six months I concluded that the\r\n     people were awakening to the truth.\r\n\r\n     I decided to make a test.\r\n\r\n     I advertised certain truths. That was all.\r\n\r\n     For three days Wall Street and the \"System\" were\r\n     panic-stricken--paper values melted to the extent of\r\n     hundreds of millions.\r\n\r\n     The laws of the land are strict about panic-breeding by\r\n     public statements.\r\n\r\n     If any of the terrible statements I have made had been\r\n     false, I should to-day be in prison or my body suspended\r\n     from a lamp-post. I could not possibly have escaped.\r\n\r\n     What I have stated is truth. No one dares gainsay it.\r\n\r\n     Wall Street and the \"System\" for the first time were\r\n     compelled to come to the rescue and put in jeopardy their\r\n     own money by buying stocks from the people at inflated\r\n     prices.\r\n\r\n     For the first time a break came while the manufacturers of\r\n     stock still held them.\r\n\r\n     The people sold them.\r\n\r\n     To-day every scheme known to frenzied financiering is being\r\n     worked to make the world believe last week's panic was the\r\n     result of stock speculators, bears, \"Standard Oil,\" and the\r\n     \"System.\"\r\n\r\n     Throughout this country and Europe is being spread the story\r\n     that I was in league with \"Standard Oil\" and the \"System,\"\r\n     that they had sold out their stocks and got me to raid the\r\n     market to shake out the public.\r\n\r\n     That another great rise is coming.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     This is clever, smart, the only thing possible under the\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     But it is a lie.\r\n\r\n     I ask the people to watch the desperate efforts that are\r\n     being made to get this lie to pass for a truth.\r\n\r\n     The \"System\" must unload on the public, but above all else\r\n     the \"System\" must convince the people that the awful\r\n     destruction of last week could not have been brought about\r\n     merely by the people's own doings.\r\n\r\n     If the people are not so convinced they will know their\r\n     power, and that they have in their own hands, to use at any\r\n     time, a weapon which can stand the \"System\" on its head.\r\n\r\n     There is no reason why the people cannot reverse the old\r\n     process and always sell at the top to the frenzied\r\n     financiers and buy from them at the bottom.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     This is my warning:\r\n\r\n     I ask the people and Wall Street and the \"System\" to give it\r\n     weight or their loss will be on their own heads.\r\n\r\n     I am going to strike again, suddenly, sharply,\r\n     sensationally, and in a way that will produce effects upon\r\n     prices and upon markets, so much more destructive, that the\r\n     effects and the destruction of last week will appear by\r\n     comparison as milk to vitriol.\r\n\r\n     Every owner of an active stock in which the \"System\" has any\r\n     interest owes it to himself to weigh my warning.\r\n\r\n     The result must be terrible for Wall Street and the\r\n     \"System,\" and nothing can avert it.\r\n\r\n     It matters not how much preparation is made, as it will come\r\n     in a way not possible to guard against.\r\n\r\n     I want all to know now, so they will not blame me when the\r\n     slaughter is on.\r\n\r\n     My first and only warning will come in the form of a public\r\n     notice that certain named stocks should be sold the day my\r\n     advertisement appears.\r\n\r\n     Three days afterward I will publish why, but with the why it\r\n     will be too late for holders of stock to save themselves.\r\n\r\n     I now say to all, if you decide after reading this that I am\r\n     only talking, well and good, but when it is too late,\r\n     remember what I did say.\r\n\r\n     While waiting for me to speak, again think it over.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     When \"Frenzied Finance\" first appeared, only six months ago,\r\n     the wise heads of the \"System\" said:\r\n\r\n     \"The public will tire of it in sixty days.\"\r\n\r\n     At the end of six months the people, the press, and the\r\n     pulpit are lashing themselves into a fury over its\r\n     revelations, and it is impossible to print magazines enough\r\n     to meet the demand.\r\n\r\n     When I first touched on the life-insurance companies they\r\n     laughed.\r\n\r\n     To-day policy-holders are panic-stricken, and the big\r\n     companies are falling behind millions a week.\r\n\r\n     When I said my story would affect Wall Street, Wall Street\r\n     laughed; last week it yelled, cursed, and begged.\r\n\r\n     And I am only in the mild, preliminary stages yet.\r\n\r\n     While waiting for the next move, make no mistake.\r\n\r\n     When real work begins Wall Street and the \"System\" will look\r\n     like a last year's straw hat in the swirls of Niagara.\r\n\r\n     AMALGAMATED\r\n\r\n     Last Tuesday morning I publicly said:\r\n\r\n     \"The men who control Amalgamated told me it is not worth\r\n     half the price it was floated at. If they told the truth it\r\n     will go back to 33. If they have lied they will smash it\r\n     back to 33 as they did before. Sell it.\"\r\n\r\n     All that day (Tuesday) holders could have sold at an average\r\n     of 79.\r\n\r\n     Holders of over 200,000 shares did.\r\n\r\n     The following day all holders could have sold at an average\r\n     of 74--300,000 did.\r\n\r\n     The third day all holders could have sold at an average of\r\n     66--200,000 did.\r\n\r\n     Then the Wall Street powers got desperate and stopped the\r\n     decline.\r\n\r\n     During these days I did not sell a share nor do anything in\r\n     the market to assist the decline, but did buy enormous\r\n     amounts to prevent it from breaking below 60.\r\n\r\n     Every scheme known to frenzied financiers is being worked to\r\n     make it appear now that this stock is going to sell much\r\n     higher.\r\n\r\n     It is advertised broadcast that I was working with the bear\r\n     raiders and \"Standard Oil.\"\r\n\r\n     This is a lie.\r\n\r\n     My brokers were requested by another client to publish a\r\n     statement that a prominent copper company president stated\r\n     there was $33 in the Amalgamated treasury.\r\n\r\n     Instantly the rumors were sent broadcast that I had settled\r\n     with \"Standard Oil\" and was bulling the stock.\r\n\r\n     This, too.\r\n\r\n     I know the man who made the statement and the high officer\r\n     of the Amalgamated who got him to make it.\r\n\r\n     And it shows the desperate position of the Amalgamated\r\n     \"Insiders.\"\r\n\r\n     They are loaded with the stock.\r\n\r\n     I dare any officer of the Amalgamated Company to publish the\r\n     above statement over his signature.\r\n\r\n     If he does court proceedings will be begun at once.\r\n\r\n     I also dare Mr. Rogers or Mr. Rockefeller to deny the\r\n     statement made by me that they have said the stock is not\r\n     worth 50, and that Marcus Daly deceived them. I dare them.\r\n\r\n     I repeat what I have said to holders of Amalgamated:\r\n\r\n     Sell your stock now, before it is too late.\r\n\r\n     Bear in mind when Amalgamated sells at 33 that I have warned\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     And in the meantime watch for sharp breaks in Amalgamated. I\r\n     will give no further warning on this stock, and under no\r\n     circumstances will change my now advertised position on it.\r\n\r\n     Thomas W. Lawson.</sc>\r\n     BOSTON, December 12, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe second test brought a stronger demonstration than the first. This\r\ntime the \"System's\" votaries were drawn up in solid phalanx; behind them\r\nuncounted millions and unmeasured power braced to meet attack. All day\r\nMonday the people hurled their securities at the gamesters, and with\r\nevery onslaught prices crumbled until, when the Stock Exchange closed,\r\nthe \"System's\" losses were represented by hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars. The people had learned a lesson, and a hundred years more of\r\nthe \"System's\" trickery and falsehood will not efface its impression.\r\n\r\n\r\nVILIFICATION NO REPLY TO FACTS\r\n\r\nThe attacks I made on the \"System\" were frank and direct statements of\r\nfacts. The destruction they wrought upon the cherished plans of the\r\ngamesters was due to their truth. If the things I stated about\r\nAmalgamated were not true, how easy to prove them false, and how\r\ncompletely then should I have been discredited. But what has the\r\n\"System\" in its blind rage done? Well may the American people who read\r\nwhat is printed below say to themselves, \"'Whom the gods would slay,\r\nthey first make mad.' What is Thomas W. Lawson in this transaction that\r\nhis personality need enter into a controversy wherein the issue is of\r\nfacts alone?\" Suppose I were all that my enemies say of me, the question\r\nis not of my guilt, but of the truth of my charges. I was not surprised\r\nto read on the morning of Tuesday, the 13th of December, the diatribe\r\nprinted below. It was published in the leading papers of the country in\r\nthe form of an advertisement, in great type covering half a page.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON--READ THIS PICTURE\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK, December 12, 1904.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     For six months I have read with close attention your story\r\n     of \"Frenzied Finance,\" in _Everybody's Magazine_, and have\r\n     paid close attention to the manner in which, by pandering to\r\n     the worst prejudices of the American people, you have\r\n     endeavored by misstatement of facts to distort the\r\n     conditions actually existing through what you call the\r\n     workings of the \"System.\"\r\n\r\n     What is the conclusion to be deducted from your own\r\n     statements? What is the \"System\" to which you have so often\r\n     referred?\r\n\r\n     From the standpoint of honest, unprejudiced men no other\r\n     conclusion can be derived but from your own statements you\r\n     have endeavored personally and through subornation of others\r\n     to debauch legislation, to distort facts, to create in the\r\n     minds of investors a lack of confidence in men whom the\r\n     public for many years have looked up to as the leaders in\r\n     the industrial world.\r\n\r\n     By every foul vilification and every statement which\r\n     distorted imagination is capable of producing, you have\r\n     endeavored to show that the so-called leaders of finance of\r\n     the United States are in league to rob and defraud the\r\n     investing public.\r\n\r\n     Taking all your statements and analyzing them, what do they\r\n     amount to? That certain men, amongst whom you yourself was\r\n     one of the leaders, have bought out certain corporations\r\n     which were capitalized at a price which you state was far\r\n     above their cost.\r\n\r\n     Not one single new fact has been brought to the attention of\r\n     the public. If men, by their brains, their capital, and\r\n     their energy, acquire properties that have not been\r\n     appreciated by the public, put them forth under whatsoever\r\n     name, so that the statements made in connection with those\r\n     properties are true, and capable of verification, what is it\r\n     but a business proposition that cannot be criticised?\r\n\r\n     What is the \"System\" which you denounce as the very\r\n     personification of evil? Is it not the \"System\" of which you\r\n     have been the leading advocate, votary, and exponent for\r\n     many years? Is not the \"System,\" when analyzed and reduced\r\n     to its root, a stock-brokerage of which you are and have\r\n     been for many years one of the shining lights; not the\r\n     system of honest, legitimate brokerage, but the system of\r\n     endeavoring by false statements and by exciting the fears of\r\n     the multitude to depress and destroy values in order that\r\n     its votaries may reap their ill-gotten gains?\r\n\r\n     Is there one thing in connection with all that you have\r\n     written in your articles on \"Frenzied Finance\" in which you\r\n     have not been from start to finish one of the prime movers?\r\n     Who is the man that, from the inception of the enterprise\r\n     which you most severely criticise, has been most prominently\r\n     before the public? Who is the man that, from your own words,\r\n     originated the idea and carried it to its completion? Is it\r\n     not Thomas W. Lawson? Who is the man that, in the various\r\n     schemes which you hold up to the condemnation of the public,\r\n     has taken from start to finish the leading part? Is it not\r\n     Thomas W. Lawson?\r\n\r\n     Is there one honest man in the United States who to-night\r\n     believes that, in spending the thousands and thousands of\r\n     dollars that you have spent in advocating your views and in\r\n     posing as the friend of the people, that you have not acted\r\n     for your own selfish ends? Do you believe that there is one\r\n     man in all this wide world to-day who honestly believes one\r\n     single statement that you have made, or who believes that\r\n     you have ever turned your hand to, or aided in the slightest\r\n     degree in, any honest enterprise? You criticise the copper\r\n     corporations who have placed their stock before the public\r\n     as a legitimate investment. Can you point to one single\r\n     instance in which a misrepresentation of fact or figure has\r\n     ever been made in anything connected with the Amalgamated\r\n     Company?\r\n\r\n     Who are you, who should say in relation to a copper mine\r\n     whether it is good or bad? Did you ever see a copper mine?\r\n     Did you ever put a pick into ore? Did you ever reduce one\r\n     ton of metal so that it would yield up its wealth for the\r\n     benefit of mankind. Have you ever done anything excepting to\r\n     act as a parasite upon honest labor and, by chicanery and by\r\n     misrepresentation, endeavor to rob the people of their hard\r\n     earnings? I speak to you plainly, knowing you yourself for\r\n     what you are. Can you show one man that can point to any\r\n     honest industry in which you ever took part; to one single\r\n     act of yourself that ever contributed to the welfare or the\r\n     advancement of the working people? Can you point to one\r\n     single act in your career that was ever based on any other\r\n     motive than absolute egotism and selfishness; to one single\r\n     utterance, act, word, or deed of yourself that was not based\r\n     on selfishness and a desire to rob or misrepresent or, in\r\n     some other manner, attach the earnings of the people to your\r\n     coffers without effort on your part?\r\n\r\n     I address this communication to you knowing you for what you\r\n     are; as a man who, throughout his many years of active life\r\n     on the Stock Exchange, came to be generally considered as\r\n     the synonym of chicanery and of misrepresentation. To-day,\r\n     through your perversion of truth and partial misstatement of\r\n     fact, which, through many years in pursuance of your\r\n     calling, you have become an adept in, you can destroy the\r\n     confidence of the people who make the money and the wealth\r\n     of the country. Do you for one moment suppose that there is\r\n     one honest person in this country to-day who believes that\r\n     you are actuated by a sincere desire to aid them?\r\n\r\n     Do you not know that your only motive is, by destroying\r\n     confidence, to endeavor to make a large profit for yourself,\r\n     by the methods which you have pursued of advertising to the\r\n     public? The men who do things, the men who created wealth,\r\n     the men who are known throughout the world for integrity and\r\n     for their business qualifications, will unanimously say that\r\n     your motive is selfish from start to finish.\r\n\r\n     Do you remember the dealings that you had with me, how they\r\n     were based on falsehood and misrepresentation from start to\r\n     finish? How, by the use of names that are well known in the\r\n     financial and business world, you endeavored to rob and\r\n     convert to your own use what you thought was one of the\r\n     greatest properties in the world? What has been the result\r\n     of your advertisements of the last few days? Has it not been\r\n     to destroy confidence, to create a panic among people who\r\n     had invested their earnings in what they have considered as\r\n     legitimate propositions? Have you ever paused and thought\r\n     for one moment about what the results of your selfish and\r\n     distorted statements might be?\r\n\r\n     In your articles you have spoken of the loss that has been\r\n     entailed upon widows and orphans, of disgrace and suicide\r\n     and other ills that have come through what you are pleased\r\n     to call the workings of the \"System,\" the \"System\" of which\r\n     you have been and are to-day the exponent, the system of\r\n     misrepresentation and of spreading false statements; in\r\n     other words, of stealing Heaven's livery to serve the devil\r\n     in. Millions of dollars of legitimate investments have been\r\n     lost to the people who have made them. Why? Because you, in\r\n     your selfish egotism, have looked to nothing but your\r\n     personal gain, thinking nothing, caring less for the woe\r\n     that you might work to thousands, pandering to the worst\r\n     prejudices, and by means of such words as \"Standard Oil,\"\r\n     \"Amalgamated,\" \"Frenzied Finance,\" etc., and making\r\n     statements which investors have not the means or the time to\r\n     dispute, you have endeavored to destroy values that have\r\n     been created by the works of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n     To-morrow, in Boston, I shall call upon you. I for many\r\n     years have stood as a worker, as a man who has built up and\r\n     who has created, and I know that the savings of a lifetime\r\n     of many honest investors have been swept away by the\r\n     falsehoods that you have spread abroad through the public\r\n     press.\r\n\r\n     To-morrow, at your office, I shall denounce you for what you\r\n     are. The Master long ago said: \"By your works ye shall be\r\n     judged.\"\r\n\r\n     Personally I shall call upon you for your answer to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     W. C. GREENE.\r\n\r\nThis is the rejoinder of the \"System.\" No denial of my facts. No defence\r\nagainst my charges, but a volley of mud and a threat of assassination. I\r\nhad dared tell the people how they had been robbed.\r\n\r\nAll remember the panic of 1901, the famous Northern Pacific corner, in\r\nwhich values shrank hundreds of millions in a few hours and tens of\r\nthousands of the people lost their entire savings. Who precipitated that\r\nterrific slaughter? Certain great railroad magnates and bankers were at\r\neach other's throats; two greedy corporations had quarrelled ferociously\r\nover the control of a railway line. No man in all our broad land dared\r\nto hint at the assassination of a Morgan or a Perkins or a Harriman or\r\nany of the \"Standard Oil\" votaries who were parties to the bitter\r\ncontest that left Wall Street strewn with the mangled and bleeding\r\ncarcasses of the ruined and bankrupt. That time, however, the \"System\"\r\nhad both money and stocks--the people had lost both.\r\n\r\nI am not going to enter into a defence of myself against Colonel\r\nGreene's charges. In the newspapers of the country that matter was fully\r\nventilated at the time. I simply republish his vituperation to show how\r\nthe \"System\" sets about silencing those who dare protest against its\r\nvillainous methods. In the first six months of the publication of my\r\nstory the sole defence the \"System\" entered against my specific and\r\nterrible charges of plunder and debauching of the people was to attack\r\nme personally. It inaugurated a war of mud-slinging and vilification\r\ndirected by the New York _Commercial_, Henry H. Rogers's own paper,\r\nwhich printed the ridiculous statement that I was crazy. This editorial\r\nmade splendid ammunition for the big insurance corporations, which\r\ncaused it to be distributed among their policy-holders, and for the\r\nyelping pack of insurance papers which may be depended on to bark, and\r\nbite the legs of any one who dares attack their master, the \"System's,\"\r\nmost profitable institutions. I find I have not space here to reproduce\r\nthese several mud broadsides, which really are more valuable as evidence\r\nof the doddering imbecility and fatuous weakness of the so-called great\r\nmen of finance than interesting or informative. Since my personality is\r\nthe issue, I propose to give my readers some testimony of a different\r\ncharacter, gathered by experts[22] in the heat of battle.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON AT CLOSE RANGE\r\n\r\n     AN INTIMATE TALK WITH THE FINANCIER AND FIGHTER\r\n\r\n     BY ARTHUR McEWEN\r\n\r\n     From the _New York American_, November 27, 1904.\r\n\r\n     Thomas W. Lawson of Boston, who is making it so interesting\r\n     for Standard Oil financiers and other able gentlemen that\r\n     add your money to their corpulent millions while you wait,\r\n     is himself an interesting man and a very puzzling one to a\r\n     great many people.\r\n\r\n     One day last week I spent several hours with him at his\r\n     rooms in Young's Hotel, and it surely was a stimulating and\r\n     enjoyable time. Everybody now knows how exceedingly well Mr.\r\n     Lawson can write, and he talks as he writes--boldly,\r\n     vividly, audaciously. He thinks out loud, pouring forth a\r\n     flood of speech, breaking off in the middle of sentences,\r\n     going into long parentheses, touching on a dozen incidental\r\n     things by way of illustration as he goes, but always coming\r\n     back to the main point. He may confuse you, but he does not\r\n     confuse himself. And notwithstanding the rapidity of his\r\n     utterance and his copiousness he is not carried away into\r\n     saying what he would rather not have said.\r\n\r\n     He is handsome--tall, broad-shouldered, strong, well-knit,\r\n     and graceful--still almost youthful physically, despite his\r\n     forty-five years and the beginning of grayness in the dark,\r\n     wavy hair which covers his large, finely arched, and\r\n     well-proportioned head. His forehead is high and broad, his\r\n     gray eyes deep set under brows that come together and give\r\n     intentness and fierceness to his gaze when he is aroused.\r\n\r\n     And when Lawson is aroused you see a fighter with all his\r\n     wits about him and of utter fearlessness. He would have made\r\n     a first-class soldier, with his quickness and dash and the\r\n     pluck that was born in him, and has not to be summoned by\r\n     thinking and resolving.\r\n\r\n     THE BOSTON VIEW OF LAWSON\r\n\r\n     The Boston view of Lawson is illuminating. They are afraid\r\n     of him on State Street. He thinks so rapidly and does things\r\n     with such instant decision that he bewilders the\r\n     conventional plodders. They admit that he is brilliant, that\r\n     he has a genius for gathering in the dollars, but he shocks\r\n     the financial Mrs. Grundy. They tell you that he is\r\n     \"irregular,\" \"sensational,\" \"bizarre,\" and the rest of\r\n     it--all of which means simply that he is a man of original\r\n     mind, who follows his own methods, succeeds with them, and\r\n     doesn't care a snap of his fingers about being out of the\r\n     fashion.\r\n\r\n     He has a hundred ideas and impulses where the \"safe and\r\n     steady-going\" business man has one--and as the safe and\r\n     steady-going State-Streeter doesn't understand the\r\n     ninety-nine Lawson ideas and impulses which do not come to\r\n     him, he charges them up to \"eccentricity\" and\r\n     \"charlatanism.\"\r\n\r\n     Boston says Lawson is vain. He certainly does hold a good\r\n     opinion of himself, and he has a right to. A boy who goes\r\n     into a bank at twelve as he did and before he is seventeen\r\n     cleans up $60,000 is hardly to be rebuked for considering\r\n     that he is better fitted for the financial game than most.\r\n     He knows life, he knows men. He has made and lost fortunes\r\n     and is not afraid of being \"broke.\"\r\n\r\n     That experience has been his repeatedly, but always he rose\r\n     again. His brains, energy, and daring would cause him to\r\n     rise anywhere. Had he been given birth in a South American\r\n     republic, the dictatorship would have been his inevitably.\r\n\r\n     Lawson was born a money-maker, but he is a great deal more\r\n     than that. He is a many-sided man, interested ardently in\r\n     lots of things to which the ordinary money-maker is\r\n     oblivious. He is very, very human. He has a soul.\r\n\r\n     Although he is raining blows on important men, who are not\r\n     accustomed to being treated with disrespect--although he is\r\n     charging them with crimes, and hopes, I should say, to drive\r\n     them out of the country or into the penitentiary, he speaks\r\n     of some of them with the greatest kindness, thoroughly\r\n     understanding their good personal qualities.\r\n\r\n     THE WONDERFUL ROGERS\r\n\r\n     He denounces H. H. Rogers, for example, as a robber, a\r\n     criminal, and he said to me:\r\n\r\n     \"Rogers is a marvellously able man and one of the best\r\n     fellows living. If you knew him only on the social side, and\r\n     knew him for years, you couldn't help loving him. He is\r\n     considerate, kindly, generous, helpful, and everything a man\r\n     should be to his friends. But when it comes to business--his\r\n     kind of business--when he turns away from his better self\r\n     and goes aboard his pirate brig and hoists the _Jolly\r\n     Rover_, God help you! And, then, as a buccaneer you have to\r\n     admire him, for he is a master among pirates, and you have\r\n     to salute him, even when he has the point of his cutlass at\r\n     the small of your back and you're walking the plank at his\r\n     order. Rogers is wonderful. He is one of the most prolific\r\n     human creatures I have ever met; prolific in thought, in\r\n     devices--and I've been at the game a long time now and ought\r\n     to know.\r\n\r\n     \"Don't think me egotistical, but I can't help looking under\r\n     the surface and going to the bottom of things. So I learn\r\n     more about men in Wall Street and what they are at than\r\n     most. This is my thirty-fourth year of sixteen and seventeen\r\n     hours a day and three hundred and sixty-five days in the\r\n     year, and I have seen them all come and go. I _am_ with the\r\n     third generation of my time now. In such matters I feel\r\n     somehow that I'm about three hundred years old.\r\n\r\n     \"Men like Rogers are all very good fellows. They are genial\r\n     and tolerant in their judgment of others. Yes, they are\r\n     mighty good fellows, until you turn them around and look at\r\n     their other side. Rogers is lovable enough until he touches\r\n     the other button. Then he goes with perfect ruthlessness for\r\n     what he wants. And yet, though you are his victim, you can't\r\n     bring yourself to hate him. After he has thrown you down and\r\n     taken all you have and you turn yourself over and find the\r\n     dark lantern has disappeared, and you hear him going up the\r\n     lane, you pick yourself out of the gutter and admire the\r\n     skill with which he did the job. If you could stand it, you\r\n     would almost whistle to have him come back and do it over.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is easy to see,\" I said, \"by what you write of Mr.\r\n     Rogers in your magazine story, that you were fond of him and\r\n     gave him the highest rank for ability, but just the same you\r\n     said you had to go on the stand in the gas suit and swear\r\n     exactly opposite to his testimony. Do you charge him flatly\r\n     with perjury?\"\r\n\r\n     \"I have put it fifty times in black and white,\" answered Mr.\r\n     Lawson, \"that he committed perjury. There isn't any question\r\n     about it. I produced my secretary's minutes, delivered over\r\n     the telephone, received by his secretary and afterward\r\n     confirmed. He confirmed the message to me, called me up and\r\n     talked it over and did business on that agreement. Two men,\r\n     Rogers and myself, followed each other on the stand and made\r\n     diametrically opposite statements; and neither one of them\r\n     reserved himself in stating that it was knowledge at first\r\n     hand. Therefore there was perjury.\"\r\n\r\n     LEGISLATIVE CORRUPTION\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Lawson, the whole country is familiar enough with\r\n     legislative corruption, so there's nothing new in your\r\n     charge that the Legislature of Massachusetts was bought up.\r\n     But what will attract national notice is the definiteness of\r\n     your accusation. You charge H.M. Whitney, brother of the\r\n     late W. C. Whitney, and one of the foremost business men of\r\n     your State, with having done the corrupting in order to get\r\n     through a complete charter for a gas company. Now, when you\r\n     pillory a person of Whitney's standing and prominence, as\r\n     you have done, he has got to do one of two things--either\r\n     force you to come to the front and compel you to prove the\r\n     truth of what you say or stand before the public morally\r\n     convicted.\"\r\n\r\n     \"That's right,\" agreed Lawson heartily.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you stand ready to prove your charge if he challenges\r\n     you to do it?\"\r\n\r\n     \"What else can I do? Of course I can prove it. I'm sorry for\r\n     Whitney. He is a good fellow on his personal side, like\r\n     Rogers, but truth is truth.\"\r\n\r\n     \"However used we may have become to buying Legislatures,\r\n     however commonplace it may be, still, when a financially\r\n     responsible man like yourself gives concrete instance, and\r\n     is prepared with proofs, the fact is horribly startling to\r\n     everybody that cares for his country. What is to be the end\r\n     of this sort of thing--the purchase of the people's\r\n     representatives by the criminal rich?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well, you can ask me a question even broader than that.\r\n     What is going to be the end, not only of such things as I\r\n     have stated in regard to the corruption of the Legislature\r\n     of Massachusetts--and we all admit that the same thing is\r\n     being done in other States--what is going to be the outcome\r\n     of this rottenness in connection with the practices in Wall\r\n     Street that I am telling about in my magazine narrative in\r\n     'Frenzied Finance'? To answer would be to disclose my\r\n     remedy--the climax to my whole story. At present I can only\r\n     say that I make no charges loosely, on insufficient\r\n     evidence. I state only what I know. I have seen the\r\n     iniquities worked out. I know that these crimes are being\r\n     committed every day; that these great financial schemes are\r\n     carried through, not only by the commission of moral crimes,\r\n     but legal crimes--crimes for which those participating in\r\n     them can be held responsible if they are gone after in the\r\n     right way, and I am going to show the right way.\r\n\r\n     THE REMEDY\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that I have a remedy. That, of course, is a\r\n     tremendous thing to say. I have spent my life on it. I have\r\n     been waiting for the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I may not ask you what your remedy is?\"\r\n\r\n     \"No, I shall propose that myself when I have laid all my\r\n     facts about these crimes before the people. I am going to\r\n     tell them about some startling crimes. All that I have told\r\n     so far, including the systematic corruption of the\r\n     Massachusetts Legislature, relates to the past. That is, the\r\n     deeds are dead, so to speak. But the crimes of Amalgamated,\r\n     though in one sense they are now past, are yet connected\r\n     with the present, because Amalgamated is alive. The man who\r\n     was robbed in 1899, in 1900, and 1901 has his claim\r\n     unsettled. That man is alive and Amalgamated is a big,\r\n     living corporation. When I get to that I shall be talking in\r\n     the present and something is going to be done.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the remedy for the whole thing. You will appreciate\r\n     the largeness of that statement, but I have thought and\r\n     advised and worked it out. My remedy is based on common\r\n     sense.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Does it aim at any real change in our political system? Is\r\n     it socialistic?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, no; it doesn't mean a turning over in politics. You and\r\n     I know that the dollar is what is running things in this\r\n     country to-day, and if you come along with an ideal\r\n     proposition--a proposition that carries with it a change in\r\n     our laws or a proposition to have some new laws passed--you\r\n     might as well say good-by to it, because the fellow whose\r\n     hundred millions you want to take away is going to say: 'How\r\n     many dollars does it need to turn that upside down?' and he\r\n     is going to supply the dollars.\"\r\n\r\n     LAWSON'S VERSATILITY\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson gave me nearly three hours of his time, and\r\n     during those three hours he was interrupted every five\r\n     minutes or so by telephone calls. He conducted his business\r\n     right along, ordering the selling and buying of stocks,\r\n     making or declining appointments, talking with his\r\n     publishers, his lawyers, his family, his friends. It would\r\n     have goaded almost any man into excitement and irritability,\r\n     but it was all in a day's work with Lawson. Yet he is not\r\n     phlegmatic; indeed, he is extraordinarily animated. But it\r\n     is animation with composure. In a business way there is not\r\n     a busier man in the country, but he finds leisure for other\r\n     interests--books, pictures, bronzes, horses. He has a\r\n     beautiful country home, where he goes daily by special\r\n     train, and then puts up the bars against business, bores,\r\n     and all intruders.\r\n\r\n     In his talk with me he ran a remarkable gamut. He spoke of\r\n     business like the shrewdest and readiest of practical men.\r\n     Then in the midst of some story of stock-market guile, such\r\n     as he is exposing in _Everybody's Magazine_, his face,\r\n     voice, and hands conveyed amusement, anger, disgust. With\r\n     his good looks and gift of expression he would have made his\r\n     way to the top of the stage. I do not know if he has done\r\n     any public speaking. But when he got into the full tide of\r\n     denunciation of the crimes of Amalgamated I regretted that\r\n     he was not addressing a great audience, for it was real\r\n     oratory--strong talk, ardent, electric, manly. His eyes\r\n     flashed, his teeth came together with a snap and he shook\r\n     both fists under my nose. He has enthusiasm, capacity for\r\n     righteous wrath, and the spirit of battle. But he doesn't\r\n     lose poise for a moment.\r\n\r\n     HIS CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF\r\n\r\n     Cheerfulness, gay confidence in his own powers, is his\r\n     predominant trait.\r\n\r\n     \"You are firing hot shot into these people,\" I said. \"They\r\n     have endless money, and you are in the stock-market, taking\r\n     chances every day. Aren't you afraid they will dig pits for\r\n     you?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well, what can they do to any of us in this world except to\r\n     send us to the poor-house or the grave? I don't fear them. I\r\n     know them and all about them. You must remember this is not\r\n     a new occupation with me. For twenty-five years or more I\r\n     have been in the habit of picking up a brick without looking\r\n     to see how many corners it had or whether it was round or\r\n     square and hitting the first head I thought I had a good\r\n     reason to hit. I have been doing these things regardless of\r\n     how they liked it. It's upward of a quarter of a century\r\n     since I had my first wrestle with a corporation in the\r\n     newspapers. I have tried not to be a common scold and\r\n     avoided being vicious when I could. I have only attacked\r\n     when I thought some fellow had done me a deliberate wrong.\r\n     And when I have felt that way I have started after him. Then\r\n     it has been vicious, hard fighting, you know; vicious, but\r\n     not malicious.\r\n\r\n     \"With the 'Standard Oil' crowd I have this big advantage--I\r\n     am only one man, a small target, and it needs a mighty good\r\n     aim to hit me, whereas they present a large surface and I\r\n     have only to heave a brick in any direction to break a\r\n     window. The contest is unequal. Everything favors me. My\r\n     ammunition is the truth.\"\r\n\r\n     There is cheerful courage for you--more particularly in the\r\n     case of a man who proclaims from the housetop that there is\r\n     no limit to the villainy of his adversaries.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Lawson,\" I said, \"there are few who would care to be in\r\n     your shoes--a rich man waging a war of this sort. The\r\n     chances are altogether in favor of their smashing you\r\n     financially.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Let them, if they can. There are worse things in this life\r\n     than being smashed financially.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson's smile was sunny and confident. He is fearless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     LAWSON, THE MAN\r\n\r\n     BY JAMES CREELMAN\r\n\r\n     From the New York _World_, December 12, 1904.\r\n\r\n     BOSTON, December 10th.\r\n\r\n     All through the critical business hours of Friday, when\r\n     Thomas W. Lawson, master spirit in the present extraordinary\r\n     war against Standard Oil finance in Wall Street, was\r\n     reported to be locked up with H. H. Rogers, generalissimo of\r\n     Standard Oil, perfecting the details of a settlement for\r\n     $6,000,000--all through that anxious time, when the\r\n     stock-tickers and newspapers of the country were trying to\r\n     guess the meaning of Mr. Lawson's sudden silence and\r\n     inaccessibility, he was standing in his quiet room in\r\n     Young's Hotel, explaining the situation to the public\r\n     through the _World_.\r\n\r\n     Although I sat in the room with him almost from the time\r\n     that the stock-market opened until long after it closed, not\r\n     once did Mr. Lawson show the slightest sign of excitement\r\n     over market affairs. Strong as an ox, clear-eyed, tranquil,\r\n     smiling, the man who had moved the financial market downward\r\n     against the will of the greatest combination of capital the\r\n     world has ever seen, bore himself like one absolutely\r\n     confident of success. The bunch of blue corn-flowers in his\r\n     button-hole was not fresher than he, although on the\r\n     previous day he had fought through one of the greatest\r\n     battles in the history of speculation, had made an\r\n     hour-and-a-half speech at a night banquet, had gone to bed\r\n     after midnight, and risen before five in the morning.\r\n\r\n     In that one day he had forced nearly 3,000,000 shares of\r\n     stock into the market in New York.\r\n\r\n     \"My one instrument is publicity,\" he said. \"It is the most\r\n     powerful weapon in the world. With it I have been able to\r\n     strike with some of the power which eighty millions of\r\n     Americans possess when they are wide-awake and in earnest.\r\n\r\n     \"This week's work is only the beginning of a demonstration\r\n     that the secrecy of the frenzied finance system--under the\r\n     cover of which the savings of the people gathered into\r\n     banks, trust institutions, and insurance companies, have\r\n     been used by the Standard Oil crowd to rob the people\r\n     through the stock-market--cannot succeed against publicity.\r\n     The people only need light to save themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"At the beginning of the week I advised the people of the\r\n     United States to sell Amalgamated Copper and the other pool\r\n     stocks. It was the first step in the final realization of\r\n     plans I had been maturing for ten years. Since then, against\r\n     the whole force of the billions and billions commanded by\r\n     the Standard Oil system, Amalgamated has dropped from 82\r\n     into the 60's. I give the people my word, which I have never\r\n     yet broken, that not once in that time have I sold a share\r\n     of Amalgamated stock. Not only that, but I have actually\r\n     bought large blocks of Amalgamated in order to steady the\r\n     market and prevent too great and too sudden a panic, so that\r\n     my friends everywhere might be able to get out without\r\n     complete ruin. But for that I believe we would have had a\r\n     panic greater than the Northern Pacific crash.\r\n\r\n     \"I simply went out into the public square and told the\r\n     people the truth. I was in a position to tell the truth. I\r\n     knew the methods by which they had been robbed. I knew that\r\n     ruin was staring them in the face unless they acted quickly.\r\n\r\n     SPENT $92,000 ADVERTISING\r\n\r\n     \"I advertised the fact over my signature in the newspapers\r\n     of New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles. I cabled the\r\n     advertisement to London. All this cost, with incidental\r\n     expenses, something like $92,000.\r\n\r\n     \"The frightened leaders and agents of the 'System' spread\r\n     reports that I was in league with the leading plungers and\r\n     manipulators of Wall Street, that I was making a mere stock\r\n     raid, that I was trying to 'shake down' Mr. Rogers. The\r\n     truth is that I have no partners. Not a soul knew my plans\r\n     until my first advertisement appeared. I have no price, for\r\n     there can be no peace now until the whole rotten scheme of\r\n     frenzied finance is smashed and things are brought back to\r\n     their natural honest level. I am in deadly earnest. No man\r\n     knows better than I do how great a service I am rendering to\r\n     the American people.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson stood squarely upon his heels, the incarnation of\r\n     strength and courage. The square head, high and wide at the\r\n     top, the long line of the jaw and broad, fighting chin, big,\r\n     blue-gray eyes, the big, flat teeth, the strong nose, large\r\n     firm mouth, sinewy neck, hairy hands, broad, deep chest,\r\n     powerfully curved thighs, and the steady voice--these were\r\n     eloquent of strength, determination, and concentration.\r\n\r\n     There was a black pearl in his cravat and an almost\r\n     priceless canary-colored diamond sparkling on his little\r\n     finger. He wore gray, striped trousers and a black coat and\r\n     vest, across which was a beaded gold watch-chain. Everywhere\r\n     in his room were flowers, roses, lilies, and bunches of the\r\n     famous Lawson Pink, the flower for which he once paid\r\n     $30,000.\r\n\r\n     The man whom I had expected to find haggard, pale,\r\n     wild-eyed, and excited, in the centre of a nervous\r\n     hurricane, was rosy-cheeked, cheerful, and apparently as\r\n     free from care as though he had never heard of Wall Street.\r\n     He spoke rapidly but in an even voice, occasionally pacing\r\n     the floor and sometimes gesturing or setting his hands\r\n     firmly on his hips. He answered questions promptly and with\r\n     an almost boyish appearance of frankness. It would be hard\r\n     to imagine a more masculine, compact, and concentrated\r\n     personality.\r\n\r\n     This is the man who left school in Cambridge at the age of\r\n     twelve, walked into Boston with his books under his arm, and\r\n     secured a three-dollar-a-week position as an office-boy\r\n     almost on the very spot where, after thirty-six years, he\r\n     has worked himself up into a position from which he feels\r\n     able to captain the fight against Standard Oil and its\r\n     allies. He owns a palace in Boston filled with works of art;\r\n     he has a six-hundred acre farm on Cape Cod, with seven miles\r\n     of fences, three hundred horses, each one of whom he can\r\n     call by name; a hundred and fifty dogs, and a building for\r\n     training his animals larger than Madison Square Garden. Some\r\n     of his horses are worth many thousands of dollars apiece.\r\n     Even the experts of the German Government who examined\r\n     Dreamwold the other day were amazed at its costliness and\r\n     perfection. Within forty-eight hours Mr. Lawson wrote and\r\n     published a large illustrated book analyzing his farm and\r\n     gave it to his German visitors as a souvenir, after\r\n     organizing for them a horse show that overwhelmed them with\r\n     surprise.\r\n\r\n     He built the yacht _Independence_ at a cost of $200,000, and\r\n     when it was shut out from the America's Cup race smilingly\r\n     threw it on the scrap heap. He established a great racing\r\n     stable, and when tired of playing with it, broke it up. He\r\n     went to Kentucky, and the day before a great trotting race\r\n     bought Boralma for $17,000. His pride was aroused by the\r\n     fact that the betting was against his trotter. He gave\r\n     $104,000 to a friend to sustain Boralma's reputation in the\r\n     betting and won $92,000. And yet he claims that he has never\r\n     been seriously interested in betting, and that his winnings\r\n     on Boralma were simply an accident.\r\n\r\n     THAT $30,000 PINK\r\n\r\n     But it was the purchase of a pink carnation, wonderful in\r\n     color and vigor, which had been named by a Boston\r\n     experimental florist after Mrs. Lawson, that made Mr.\r\n     Lawson's name known all over the world. Thirty thousand\r\n     dollars for a pink! The news was spread broadcast, and\r\n     printed in the newspapers of all countries as an\r\n     illustration of the vulgar extravagance and folly of an\r\n     American millionaire.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson explained that incident while I was with him, and\r\n     his explanation threw a new light upon his character. He\r\n     bought the flower originally as a matter of sentiment, but\r\n     the sum he offered was comparatively small. Mr.\r\n     Higginbotham, of Chicago, bid $25,000 for the Lawson Pink.\r\n     When he heard this news, Mr. Lawson sat down with a florist\r\n     friend and figured out the possibility of the new flower as\r\n     a business investment. He closed the matter in a few minutes\r\n     by paying $30,000. Some time later on the florist bought\r\n     back the right to the Lawson pink for $30,000, and gave Mr.\r\n     Lawson, in addition, $15,000 profit, according to agreement.\r\n\r\n     A curious evidence of this man's astonishing coolness is the\r\n     fact that, at the very time when the market was closing on\r\n     Friday, when it was whispered all over the country that he\r\n     was arranging terms of peace for the Standard Oil with Mr.\r\n     Rogers, Mr. Lawson was actually explaining the peculiar and\r\n     beautiful qualities of his favorite flower.\r\n\r\n     A REASON FOR HIS LAST ATTACK\r\n\r\n     \"But if Amalgamated Copper shares were worth $100 when you\r\n     were market manager for Mr. Rogers and his friends, how is\r\n     it that they are not worth that price now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson leaned against the edge of an open door and\r\n     thrust his hands deeply into his pockets.\r\n\r\n     \"I have tried to make that plain to the public,\" he said\r\n     quietly.\r\n\r\n     \"The other day Mr. Rogers's lawyer was trying to get me to\r\n     stop. I told him that I intended to force the Standard Oil\r\n     crowd to put the price of Amalgamated Copper back to $100,\r\n     at which I advised my friends to buy it. He said that the\r\n     stock was not worth $100. I asked him how he knew. He\r\n     answered that Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stillman, Mr. Rockefeller, and\r\n     the other fellows in control had discovered that they had\r\n     been deceived when the property was bought. They did not\r\n     consider it worth more than $45 a share.\r\n\r\n     \"That settled it in my mind. I appealed to the public to\r\n     test the situation. I advised them to sell Amalgamated at\r\n     once and keep on selling. If it was worth $100, the men in\r\n     the 'System,' having billions of dollars behind them, would\r\n     buy it. If it was worth only $45 a share, then the price\r\n     must fall to that point in the end. It was simply a question\r\n     whether the public could unload on the Standard Oil crowd\r\n     before the 'System' could unload on the public.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Then you caught the leaders of Standard Oil at the\r\n     psychological moment.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lawson's smile was beyond words to describe.\r\n\r\n     \"That partly explains the crash,\" he said. \"They were ready\r\n     to unload on the public, but the public moved too quickly.\r\n     Publicity destroyed the one great weapon of the Standard Oil\r\n     men, which is secrecy. I had been tricked and deceived, and\r\n     those who were responsible had used my name to deceive and\r\n     trick the public. I got out into the open and laid the plot\r\n     bare. I had been working up to that point for many years,\r\n     always waiting, waiting, waiting for the day when I could\r\n     begin a work of reformation in behalf of 80,000,000 of\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n     \"I know my game. I have stood here in Boston for thirty-six\r\n     years studying man and his ways. I have no false conceptions\r\n     of my own strength. I know, and I have known all along, that\r\n     to win against a system backed by billions of dollars\r\n     working in the dark and controlling largely the law-making\r\n     powers of the nation, I must have the people with me. My\r\n     articles in _Everybody's Magazine_ were simply in\r\n     preparation of the public mind for the practical\r\n     demonstration which I have made this week, that the\r\n     whispering manipulators of Wall Street will not buy at $68 a\r\n     share stock which they were selling to the public at $100 a\r\n     share.\r\n\r\n     \"The Standard Oil interests came into my world simply\r\n     because they entered Boston to control gas affairs. They\r\n     wanted to run their automobile down a particular road, but\r\n     they found a fellow standing in the middle of the road. They\r\n     did not dare to run over that fellow, as little as he was,\r\n     because he warned them that he had in his pocket a stick of\r\n     dynamite that would blow the machine up if it passed over\r\n     him. Mr. Rogers is a really big and brainy man. He saw and\r\n     understood the situation. He offered to take me inside of\r\n     his secret lines.\r\n\r\n     HIS INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n     \"It is said by my enemies, and they are many--and some of\r\n     them are crackajacks, I admit--that I am a squealer, that I\r\n     have peached on my pals. That is absolutely untrue. From my\r\n     boyhood up I have always insisted on being free and\r\n     independent. I have punched a head when I thought it needed\r\n     punching, without asking whose it was or what the\r\n     consequences would be. But I have never consciously told a\r\n     lie or violated a confidence. The newspaper files will show\r\n     that when I made my deal with the Standard Oil people, I\r\n     publicly announced that I had entered into a secret\r\n     agreement with them. That brought a hurried call from Mr.\r\n     Rogers, who wanted to know what I meant. I told him, as I\r\n     had told him before, that I had to work in my own way, that\r\n     my methods were open and above board, and that I could not\r\n     work successfully unless I was free to do things as I\r\n     thought they should be done.\r\n\r\n     \"That was my arrangement with Standard Oil. They had a great\r\n     chest, and the whole method of the 'System' was to prevent\r\n     any one from getting a peep at that chest save as one of\r\n     them and on their own terms. I refused to be bound by their\r\n     code. I told Mr. Rogers again and again that everything I\r\n     learned as the market manager of the Standard Oil interests\r\n     I felt free to use publicly at any time. Mr. Rogers again\r\n     and again assured me that this was fully understood.\r\n\r\n     THE REMEDY\r\n\r\n     \"All through that time I had, deep down in my heart, the\r\n     plan which I am carrying out now. Each day brought me nearer\r\n     to the day when I would expose the whole system of fraud to\r\n     the public. Having that idea always present with me, I was\r\n     careful to avoid deals or partnerships which involved any\r\n     loss of independence to act when the day for action came. I\r\n     have been worth as much as $28,000,000, and I have lost as\r\n     much as $14,000,000. But never have I altered my purpose to\r\n     awaken the public to a realization of the great crimes\r\n     committed against them in the name of finance.\r\n\r\n     \"If the people will stand by me, and I have always been open\r\n     and honest with them, America will witness a great\r\n     transformation. With an honest and courageous President in\r\n     the White House we shall see whether the 'System' will be\r\n     able to use the fiduciary institutions of the country for\r\n     piratical purposes. The fall in the price of Amalgamated and\r\n     other pool stocks is only a bubble on the surface. The final\r\n     revelation, and the final solution, are yet to come into\r\n     sight.\"\r\n\r\n     Just then the telephone bell rang and Mr. Lawson put the\r\n     receiver to his ear and laughed as he listened. \"No,\" he\r\n     answered softly, through the instrument, \"I am not locked up\r\n     with Mr. Rogers, but with a man who has more power.\"\r\n\r\n     Then he turned to me, rocking back strongly on his heels and\r\n     clasping his hands behind his square head.\r\n\r\n     \"I meant that,\" he said; \"there is more power in the pen of\r\n     one honest writer in the service of an honest, fearless\r\n     newspaper than in all the wealth and cunning of the\r\n     'System.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUNROE & MUNROE EPISODE\r\n\r\nThere came a time in the first twelve months of my \"Frenzied Finance\"\r\ncrusade when people rather took the attitude that I was exaggerating\r\nconditions and that neither Wall Street nor the \"System\" was so bad as I\r\nhad depicted them. About this time, following the so-called Lawson\r\npanic, occurred the Munroe & Munroe _esclandre_, the details of which\r\nplainly showed eminent financiers in the vulgar business of\r\nstock-washing. I frankly treated the subject in _Everybody's_, and as it\r\nis part of the history of the movement, I reproduce the passage:\r\n\r\nThe average man is prone to lose sight of perfidy in magnitude and to\r\nsay, when he hears all the facts: \"At least these rascals hunt big\r\ngame.\" I wish to say here that such distinction is undeserved. The\r\n\"System\" is omnivorous. Its insatiable maw yawns as greedily for the\r\nten-cent pieces of the people as for the thousands of the larger\r\ninvestor. It is as avid and relentless in devising ant-traps as\r\nelephant-snares. There fell into my hands recently certain valuable\r\ndocuments in the meanest of contemporary swindles, which reveal the\r\nconnection of the National City Bank, certain of its officers and other\r\nimportant financial interests, with a plot to fleece the fag ends of the\r\npublic. The details of the Munroe & Munroe-Montreal & Boston conspiracy\r\nhave been widely published, and the world is well acquainted now with\r\nthe two Munroes, graduates of a \"gents' furnishing-goods\" shop in\r\nMontreal, introduced into high finance in New York, organizing with the\r\nassistance of the great Rockefeller-Stillman-Rogers bank a copper\r\ncorporation with shares at a par value of five dollars. There never was\r\nsuch barefaced exploitation as was used on behalf of this proposition.\r\nIt was advertised as a bonanza; investors were guaranteed against loss\r\nby an assurance that their stock would double and treble in price, and\r\nthat the company would stand ready at all times to buy back shares at\r\ncost. The intention was plainly to entice into the Montreal & Boston\r\npeople of very limited means, who could ill afford to lose their\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\nThe sudden panic, brought about by the warning to the people of the\r\ntraps that were being set for them, caught napping many of the\r\n\"System's\" votaries, large and small, and before they could get their\r\ndifferent devices even-keeled from the shock caused by that single blast\r\nof truth, the public got a peep 'tween decks into the machinery. Among\r\nthose whose port-holes were blown wide open was the Munroe & Munroe-City\r\nBank-Montreal & Boston outfit, whose scheme went down like a card-house\r\nin the blow. A receiver was at once appointed to take care of the\r\ndébris. This mishap revealed an amazing condition of affairs. With only\r\n$2,000 capital, Munroe & Munroe had arranged with the great National\r\nCity Bank to honor their checks for immense sums every day, the proceeds\r\nbeing used to carry on a series of fictitious transactions in Montreal &\r\nBoston stock for the purpose of beguiling the public into purchasing it.\r\nThe affair was a ten-days' wonder, and was finally squelched by the\r\ngreat bank's throwing over its vice-president, Archibald G. Loomis, who\r\nhad bravely shouldered the responsibility for the transaction. At\r\nwriting, two professional gamblers, who seem to have been the principal\r\nvictims of the underwriting end of the swindle, are being settled with,\r\nand the whole affair will soon be buried from public gaze.\r\n\r\nThe episode was, on the whole, so foul in its revelation of greed that\r\neven Wall Street was horrified--not at the arrant double-dealing\r\nexposed, but that the \"System\" should descend to such vulgar\r\nmalpractice. The documents now in my possession, which I shall publish\r\nlater in my story, include the original underwriters' agreement, which,\r\nat great cost of time and money, has so far been kept from the public,\r\nand they show some of the greatest bankers in the land deliberately\r\nplanning, by the use of fraudulent papers and bogus agreements, to\r\nbeguile investors to adventure their money in a scheme the sole purpose\r\nof which was the enrichment of its organizers. The whole performance\r\nreveals a depravity so profound and a greed so heartless that the people\r\nmay well tremble for the safety of their savings intrusted to the\r\ncustody of men of this type. It also proves my contention that the\r\n\"System,\" while depending on burglary for its largest returns, does not\r\ndespise the small profits of the pick-pocket.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Groups of Stock-Exchange members each day appear to buy from other\r\ngroups great quantities of shares of different stocks at advancing prices.\r\nIn reality all the brokers--the ones appearing to buy and those who sell to\r\nthem--are in league with each other, and none of the transactions is\r\nactual. The performance bears the same relation to legitimate\r\nStock-Exchange trading that the purchase and sale of a gold brick among\r\nconfederates at a circus do to the genuine work of the gamblers and\r\npick-pockets who are really attending to business around them. On certain\r\ndays in the months I refer to, when the official records of the Stock\r\nExchange told that one and a half million shares had been bought and sold,\r\nand prices had advanced until the aggregate increase in the worth of the\r\nstocks dealt in amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars, not more than\r\na few thousand shares of real stock changed hands. The rest was barefaced\r\nfraud for the purpose of deceiving the millions of investors and\r\nspeculators throughout the country who are dependent upon the daily press\r\nand \"market letters\" for information in regard to investments for their\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n[22] Arthur McEwen and James Creelman are among the strongest and ablest of\r\nAmerican newspaper writers. Their names are not as familiar to the readers\r\nof magazines as some others, but they are, perhaps, the most highly paid\r\nmen in journalism to-day, and they have a well-earned reputation for\r\nindependence and personal integrity. Mr. McEwen, who is now one of the\r\neditors of the New York _American_, is known throughout the country as a\r\nfearless exponent of corporate villainies. Mr. Creelman is a distinguished\r\nmember of the New York _World's_ editorial staff, and has interviewed more\r\nof the world's great men than any other journalist living. From their\r\nstanding in their profession, their well-known hatred of hypocrisies and\r\nshams, their wide experience in estimating men of all degrees--the verdict\r\nof Mr. Creelman and Mr. McEwen, as set forth in their papers, should be\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEXPLANATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revelations I delivered to the public in my story of \"Frenzied\r\nFinance,\" together with the accompanying expositions of insurance and\r\nother rottenness in the \"Critics\" department, were not accepted without\r\nprotest from my correspondents. Though the majority of the letters that\r\ncame to me in shoals from all parts of the country have been generous in\r\ntheir appreciation of my work, many have seriously taken my methods to\r\ntask and dubiously questioned my motives. The most salient and\r\nsatisfactory expression of these doubters was a letter that came to me\r\nfrom a New York banker, to which I replied at length, for it afforded me\r\nthe opportunity to get before my readers in general many matters about\r\nwhich explanations seemed due them. The letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: I have read all that you have written in\r\n     _Everybody's Magazine_, and have been unusually interested.\r\n     If you will consult the Amalgamated subscription list you\r\n     will see my house is down for quite a large amount. For this\r\n     reason and others, and as an old member of our Stock\r\n     Exchange, I naturally follow such writings as yours. At the\r\n     beginning I agreed with most bankers in believing that you\r\n     were actuated by a desire to get even with Mr. Rogers, Mr.\r\n     Rockefeller, or Mr. Addicks; but as your tale progressed I\r\n     thought I perceived a sincere desire to carry out some\r\n     genuine work of reform in the system of conducting the stock\r\n     business; then when you began your advertising work last\r\n     December, I shifted again and felt that your efforts were\r\n     probably for personal gain.\r\n\r\n     Since then I have noted your every move with an acute\r\n     interest, for I became convinced that you were going to work\r\n     considerable mischief before you got through. Of late you\r\n     have been so bold--and I believe I voice the opinions of the\r\n     large majority of men connected with financial affairs when\r\n     I say _dangerous_--that I cannot resist writing you as I do\r\n     herewith.\r\n\r\n     You advertise through the daily press and in your \"Critics\"\r\n     pages that you are doing all in your power to create unrest\r\n     and fear among the people for the purpose of frightening\r\n     them into selling their stocks and bonds, and you go further\r\n     and openly make the most astounding of statements, the most\r\n     dangerous and vicious--that you will endeavor to have all\r\n     the people owning deposits in banks, trusts, and insurance\r\n     companies withdraw them in concert.\r\n\r\n     I will be frank and state that if I did not know your\r\n     business career, and had not read your writings, I should\r\n     dismiss this latter statement of yours by calling on the\r\n     proper authorities to take cognizance of you as a most\r\n     dangerous lunatic, but as your business career and your\r\n     writings show you to be an able financier, a successful\r\n     business man, an advanced thinker and brilliant writer, I\r\n     feel that mental derangement cannot be the cause of this\r\n     remarkable proceeding.\r\n\r\n     Therefore I challenge you, as one who professes to be an\r\n     honest man, to answer at once the inclosed list of questions\r\n     fully and unqualifiedly in your magazine before you make any\r\n     more extraordinary and, I believe, perilous public requests;\r\n     and I warn you that if you do not do so, I shall consider it\r\n     my duty to make public through the press of this country,\r\n     and in other places where you have been advertising your\r\n     vicious theories, that you have not dared to make answer. In\r\n     other words, I shall, after the next issue of _Everybody's\r\n     Magazine_, if it does not contain your answers, publish\r\n     broadcast a copy of this letter, and in all fairness and\r\n     sincerity, I warn you I shall not be deterred from doing\r\n     this by any excuse you may make that my letter was received\r\n     too late for the July number of the magazine, or that more\r\n     important matters take up your space. I have, by diligent\r\n     research, ascertained that you will have at least\r\n     forty-eight hours from the time this letter is placed in\r\n     your hands before the section containing your \"Lawson and\r\n     His Critics\" pages is sent to press; or, to be plainer, I\r\n     can have advertisements inserted in the same section as that\r\n     containing your \"Critics\" pages if I hand in my copy\r\n     forty-eight hours after you will have received my letter.\r\n\r\n     Therefore you have sufficient time to formulate your answer,\r\n     and you know as well as I that, in the present excited\r\n     condition of the public mind, which has been created largely\r\n     by your public statements, there can be nothing more\r\n     deserving of space in _Everybody's Magazine_ than the\r\n     answers to my questions. You must realize, sir, that in all\r\n     sections of the country small holders of stocks are not only\r\n     selling their holdings, but that small depositors in banks\r\n     and trust companies are already beginning to withdraw their\r\n     deposits, that already many small banks have failed because\r\n     of this feeling of apprehension. So far as Wall Street is\r\n     concerned, legitimate business is practically dead, and you\r\n     have, for the time being at least, killed it. I will not add\r\n     what ill your attacks have worked in the large insurance\r\n     companies, for it is, I am sorry to say, patent to all that\r\n     there is but little life-insurance business being done at\r\n     present by the very large companies, and at best it will\r\n     require years to live down the unsettlement you have\r\n     wrought in the people's confidence in this worthy and\r\n     time-proven institution.\r\n\r\n     These are the questions I want answers to, and answers in\r\n     keeping with those broad professions of honesty and keen\r\n     regard for the best interests of the people which you have\r\n     been making.\r\n\r\n     Earnestly and respectfully yours,\r\n         ----\r\n\r\n     1. Do you know economics and finance, money, banking,\r\n     credits, corporations, and business in their broad relations\r\n     to the people, the American Government, and natural law, and\r\n     the relation each holds to the other, or is your knowledge\r\n     confined to the skimming and smattering such as any alert\r\n     and bright stock speculator would naturally pick up in years\r\n     of experience as a broker and manipulator?\r\n\r\n     2. Do you not know that in all times there have been, and\r\n     must naturally be, very rich men, and that necessarily there\r\n     can be but very few of these, and that where they are there\r\n     must be very many times as many poorer ones, very poor ones?\r\n\r\n     3. Do you not know that there must be billions of dollars'\r\n     worth of stocks and bonds in America, and that they must not\r\n     only increase but increase very rapidly, and that their\r\n     existence instead of being evidence of great evil is proof\r\n     positive of the great prosperity of the whole country and\r\n     the whole people, and that it is the sacred duty of all the\r\n     people down to the very poorest, who own none of these, to\r\n     guard, protect, and maintain their price, and not the duty\r\n     of any honest man to destroy or shrink the value of this\r\n     evidence of real wealth?\r\n\r\n     4. Do you not know that a large portion of all these stocks\r\n     and bonds is owned by the masses of the people; that if they\r\n     should be frightened into selling them there would be no\r\n     place to put the vast sums they would receive for them, as\r\n     the banks could not profitably use this cash if it were\r\n     added to what is deposited now, and that the only sufferers\r\n     by this frightened and forced selling would be the people\r\n     whom you profess to be working for?\r\n\r\n     5. Do you not know that if the people should start on a\r\n     given day to withdraw their money from the banks and trust\r\n     companies throughout this country, there would be the worst\r\n     calamity in this country that the world has ever witnessed;\r\n     that all lines of business would be disorganized; that the\r\n     country would be set back a very long time, and that the\r\n     principal sufferers would be the working people and the\r\n     farmers, and, in fact, all those classes you profess to be\r\n     working for; and do you not know that in the middle of this\r\n     calamity you would probably be lynched and perhaps torn limb\r\n     from limb by the crazed and deluded people, who would then\r\n     see the danger of your teachings?\r\n\r\n     6. Do you not know that the result of the people's selling\r\n     their stocks and bonds in concert would be a great drop in\r\n     their price, and that the people's raiding the banks and\r\n     trust companies of their deposits would also bring about a\r\n     tremendous drop in the price of stocks and bonds; that the\r\n     only ones who can possibly benefit are the bears who sell\r\n     short; that these bears have no legitimate standing in the\r\n     business world, and should have none, and that in the\r\n     broadest sense of the term they are not honest men?\r\n\r\n     7. Do you not know that the greatest institution in this\r\n     country to-day is life insurance, and that if you disturb\r\n     the confidence of the people in life insurance their\r\n     families will be deprived of the greatest source of income\r\n     at a time when most in need of it?\r\n\r\n     8. Do you not know that there can be no new remedy for the\r\n     present condition of affairs, even if it is really as bad as\r\n     you picture it, and that the only remedy or cure possible is\r\n     a more honest enforcement of our present laws, a more honest\r\n     conduct of our present enormous business, and a more\r\n     intelligent recognition by the working people and farmers of\r\n     the inevitable natural laws? Also that there can be nothing\r\n     more pernicious than this constant teaching them that their\r\n     interests are opposed to the interests of the very rich\r\n     class?\r\n\r\n     9. Did you not write your story to advertise yourself for\r\n     the purpose of making money out of the following your\r\n     disclosures would bring you and for the purpose of making\r\n     money for _Everybody's Magazine_?\r\n\r\n     10. Do you not own the largest part of _Everybody's\r\n     Magazine_, and has not your part of the profits received\r\n     from that source since you began your story been very large?\r\n\r\n     11. Do you not sell stocks short before each of your\r\n     advertisements, and are not the press stories and the one\r\n     now current in Wall Street that you made over a million\r\n     dollars in the decline which preceded the appearance of the\r\n     June _Everybody's_, true?\r\n\r\n     12. Are you going to commit the crime of calling out bank\r\n     and trust company deposits?\r\n\r\n     13. If you make such a call, and it is answered, and there\r\n     is a destructive panic and a number of the big New York\r\n     banks and trust companies fail, what will you do?\r\n\r\n     14. If the masses should sell their stocks and bonds and get\r\n     their money, what would then happen?\r\n\r\n     15. Do you dare say to your readers now and unqualifiedly,\r\n     that you have a real remedy for the present financial evils,\r\n     and that it will show when it is given that it is anything\r\n     more than some new scheme by which you personally are to get\r\n     the people's money?\r\n\r\n     16. Do you dare to say now to your readers unqualifiedly\r\n     that this remedy will show conclusively that it has not been\r\n     invented since you began your story of \"Frenzied Finance\"?\r\n\r\n     17. Do you dare tell your readers now and unqualifiedly that\r\n     you personally did not make money out of what you call the\r\n     \"Amalgamated swindle\"?\r\n\r\n     18. Do you dare tell your readers now and unqualifiedly that\r\n     you have not made money, and an enormous amount of it--very\r\n     much more than all you have spent in connection with your\r\n     work of \"Frenzied Finance\"--out of the people since your\r\n     story began?\r\n\r\n     I will state in fairness to you before you make answer to\r\n     the above questions that it is now my intention to take\r\n     your answers into court in a suit which will be brought, and\r\n     that if you have made answers different from those you make\r\n     under oath you will be held up to the scorn of the whole\r\n     American people.\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\nI admire your smartness. Of the thousands of letters I have recently\r\nreceived yours is the cunningest. If I do not answer your shrewd and\r\nadroitly put questions in the brief space at my disposal, you will\r\ndiscredit my work. If I take offence at your way of putting your\r\nquestions, you will have the pretext you are evidently looking for.\r\nThen, your closing warning is so manly and generous! I must not lie,\r\nbecause, if I do, you will expose me in court! You thought that would\r\nmake good reading after I had refused to make reply in this issue, and\r\nyou had advertised your letter. Again, you probably figured that as my\r\nJune chapter was all taken up with my story and there was no room for\r\nthe insurance article I had promised, I should need all my \"Critics\"\r\nspace this month for it; so, all in all, I guess you were pretty sure I\r\ncould not answer your apparently fair and honest questions.\r\n\r\nI'll disappoint you. If my \"Critics\" pages had actually been on the\r\npress at the moment your questions came in, I should have telegraphed\r\nthe publishers to yank off the plates and hold up the edition at my own\r\nexpense until I should have had time to polish off your interrogations.\r\nBefore starting in let me say to you that if you will find a way of\r\ngetting my answers out into the open under oath, I shall consider that\r\nyou have done me and my work a good turn.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 1. I _know_ economics and finance, money, banking, credits,\r\ncorporations, and business in their broad relations to the people, the\r\nAmerican Government, and natural laws, and the relation each holds to\r\nthe other--not so well as I should like to know them, but as well as any\r\nmember of the \"Standard Oil,\" of the \"System,\" or any one of their\r\nhirelings knows them. You have been brutally blunt in putting your\r\nquestions, so don't accuse me of egotism if I bluntly answer: I know\r\nthem all, top, sides, and bottom, from thirty-six years' book study of\r\nthem and thirty-six years' actual experience in the nine-pin alleys\r\nwhere they are daily and nightly set up for the express purpose of being\r\nknocked down. I know the relation of each of these important life\r\nfactors to each of the now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don't jokers of the\r\n\"System.\" Make no mistake, Mr. Banker, my knowledge is not \"a skimming\r\nand smattering such as any alert and bright stock speculator would\r\nnaturally pick up in years of experience as a broker and manipulator,\"\r\nbut the straight brand which the \"Standard Oil\" and the \"System\" so like\r\nto impress into their service when they run up against it in their\r\ncontinuous robbing excursions. You may judge that my knowledge is not of\r\nthe smattering kind when I say that for years, in spite of my refusal to\r\njoin the band and wear the collar, whenever Rogers and Rockefeller had a\r\nparticularly hard nut to crack they called me in to try it on my\r\n\"_knows_.\"\r\n\r\n2. Yes, I am aware that there have always been, and that there will\r\nalways continue to be, very rich men, and that there cannot be many of\r\nthem, and that where they are there must be very poor ones. And I also\r\nknow that no honest man, rich or poor, objects to the necessarily few\r\nvery rich ones who have honestly acquired great fortunes as the reward\r\nof their own or their ancestors' labors of body or brain in the interest\r\nof all the people. Don't misunderstand me--no honest man or woman can\r\nobject to the _necessary_ great fortunes, but all honest American men\r\nand women do object, and are getting ready to make their objection\r\nheard, to all unnecessary great fortunes, \"made dollar\" fortunes gained\r\nby trick of finance or evasion of law, or the brutal and ruthless stock\r\nmanipulation of recent years. The sooner the \"System\" and the other\r\npossessors of these \"unnecessaries\" realize that their doom is sealed\r\nand dig for the cyclone cellars, the quicker the American people will\r\nget through with the strenuous house-cleaning job for which they are\r\njust rolling up their sleeves.\r\n\r\n3. I do know there must be billions of dollars' worth of stocks and\r\nbonds in America. I also know that among these legitimate billions of\r\ndollars are now mixed other billions of dollars that have no proper\r\ntitle to being, save the greed of the \"System.\" That while the existence\r\nof certain billions of dollars' worth of stocks and bonds is proof\r\npositive of the great prosperity of the whole country and the whole\r\npeople, it does not follow that their existence is proof that the hands\r\nthey are found in are the hands they should rest in. Further, I assert\r\nthat the existence of other billions of dollars' worth of stocks and\r\nbonds is proof positive that the laws have been violated and that the\r\ngreat prosperity of the whole country has been used as the excuse and\r\nmotive of this violation, and declare that, in my opinion, it is the\r\nduty of honest men and women to do all in their power to shrink\r\nfictitious securities and to destroy them; and, further, that it is the\r\nduty of all honest men to lend a hand so that the legitimate billions of\r\ndollars of stocks and bonds may be returned to the hands of those who\r\nare legally entitled to them.\r\n\r\n4. I am aware that the people owned billions of these stocks and bonds\r\nthree years ago, and also that if they had then sold them back to the\r\n\"System,\" even at the price they had paid for them, and had kept their\r\nmoney in the banks without interest, or had even buried it in the ground\r\nor kept it in their stockings for a year, they would have been able to\r\nbuy back for fifty cents on the dollar what they had sold the \"System,\"\r\nthereby making for themselves billions of dollars and impoverishing the\r\n\"System\" by just as many billions as they had made. You know that the\r\n\"System,\" after it had loaded up the people with its stocks, \"shook them\r\nout,\" and thereby gathered in half the billions of money the people had\r\npaid for what they bought.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate. The people bought of the \"System\" for 760 millions of\r\ndollars the Steel Trust stocks and bonds, and after the people had the\r\n\"System's\" chromos and the \"System\" had the people's 760 millions of\r\nsavings, the \"System\" caused the price to be cut in two. Then it bought\r\nback the Steel Trust's chromos for 380 millions, thereby transferring\r\nfrom the people to the \"System,\" in this one instance alone, 380\r\nmillions. And, further, after the people had been shaken out of their\r\nstocks and bonds and the millions of their savings--in the Steel Trust\r\nalone 380 millions--the \"System,\" having these securities in its\r\npossession, began to inflate prices for the purpose of again selling to\r\nthe people; in December last they had inflated the prices of billions of\r\nstocks and bonds to their old false figures, and were then preparing to\r\nunload them on to the people; in the case of the Steel Trust stocks and\r\nbonds the price had again mounted to 760 millions. In compliance with my\r\nwarnings the people began in December last to unload upon the \"System\"\r\nthe billions they then held at these inflated prices, and they have\r\ncontinued to do so ever since, and have suffered no hardship by the\r\nforced selling into which I have frightened them. I further know that\r\nthey will find good use for this money at a later period in buying back\r\nfrom the \"System\" these same securities at their true worth; in other\r\nwords, that before I am through with my work they will be able to\r\nrepurchase from the \"System\" for 380 millions or less the Steel stocks\r\nand bonds now selling for 760 millions.\r\n\r\n5. I do know that one of the most colossal impositions ever perpetrated\r\non the whole people of any nation is that formula which the \"System\" has\r\nso insidiously instilled into the minds of the American people during\r\nthe last century, to wit: that they must do nothing which might disturb\r\nthe \"System\" in its use at two to four per cent. per annum of all the\r\npeople's savings, deposited in banks and trust companies throughout the\r\ncountry; that if they do, there will be a Wall Street panic, and thereby\r\nall the people will be made to suffer great hardships. On the contrary,\r\nI know that if the people do what is necessary to shake off the\r\n\"System's\" strangling grip upon their savings, the \"System\" will suffer\r\ndeath, and everlasting profit and advantage will accrue to the nation.\r\nThough it be necessary for the people to withdraw from the banks and\r\ntrust and insurance companies their billions of savings, and even though\r\nsuch withdrawal must cause a temporary business crash and the failure of\r\nmany of the financial institutions of the country, the sacrifice would\r\nbe many thousand times compensated for by the benefits that would follow\r\nin its train. I will go further and state that if such radical action\r\nshould become necessary, the people should willingly face the failure\r\nand destruction of one-half the banking institutions of New York if by\r\ndoing so they could absolutely destroy the \"System.\" But do not\r\nmisunderstand me--the simultaneous withdrawal of the people's savings\r\nfrom the banks and trust companies throughout the United States would be\r\nsuch a terrible temporary hardship that nothing could justify it but the\r\nabsolute necessity for uprooting and eradicating the \"System\"; I should\r\nnot hesitate, however, to face the full responsibility for such a move\r\nif the \"System\" cannot be destroyed in any other way, even though I were\r\nsure I should be lynched or torn limb from limb by those people who have\r\nbeen crazed and deluded, not by my teachings, but by the damnable\r\ndoctrines and acts of the \"System\" and its votaries.\r\n\r\n6. I am well aware that the result of the people's selling their stocks\r\nand bonds in concert and the withdrawal of their savings would bring a\r\ntremendous drop in the price of stocks and bonds. _This is what I am\r\nworking for_, but I am proceeding in such a way that I believe when the\r\ncrash comes the people will be free from their stocks and bonds. Your\r\nproposition that the bears will be the only beneficiaries I regard as\r\nrot; on the contrary, I know that the people will benefit a dollar where\r\nthe combined bears will benefit a cent. Pardon my giving you here an A B\r\nC lesson in finance--I know a bear is no more dishonest than a bull.\r\nWhen a man tries to put up the price of stocks and bonds, he is a bull.\r\nWhen he tries to put them down, he is a bear. If a bull tries to put\r\nprices to a point of fair worth, he is an honest bull. When he tries to\r\nput them any higher than fair worth, he is a dishonest bull, for he does\r\nso for the purpose of obtaining from the one to whom the stocks are sold\r\na greater gain than he is entitled to, and always by false pretences.\r\nWhen a bear tries to put stocks from an artificially high price to their\r\nfair worth, he is an honest bear. When he tries to put them any lower,\r\nhe is a dishonest bear, because he does so for the purpose of purchasing\r\nfrom their owners stocks or bonds at less than their fair price, that he\r\nmay pocket the difference between the artificially low price he makes\r\nand the higher price at which he has sold, and this profit is procured\r\nby false pretence. You, and thousands like you, should get out of your\r\nheads the false notion that a bear is necessarily less honest than a\r\nbull.\r\n\r\n7. Life insurance is a great institution, and should be a sacred\r\ninstitution--_provided_ it is honest life insurance. He who would, for\r\nany dishonest reason, disturb the people's confidence in honest life\r\ninsurance I consider a criminal; but I am sure that one who, having the\r\npower to awaken the people to their peril, yet stands silently by and\r\nsuffers them to be bled and plundered in the name of life insurance is\r\neven a greater scoundrel.\r\n\r\n_What is life insurance--honest life insurance?_ A contract between two\r\nparties by which the first agrees, in return for a certain fixed charge\r\nper year, to pay to the family or other beneficiary of the second party\r\na stipulated sum in case of said second party's death; but it is plainly\r\nunderstood between them that the annual charge exacted by the first\r\nparty shall be only such an amount as will insure the carrying out of\r\nthe contract, plus whatever is the legitimate expense of conducting the\r\nbusiness connected therewith. Under no circumstances would I say aught\r\nin disparagement of such a contract, but if I did not lift my voice\r\nagainst such life insurance as is carried on by the Mutual, New York\r\nLife, and Equitable companies, knowing what I do know, I should be a\r\ndeep-dyed scoundrel.\r\n\r\nLife insurance as it has been conducted in the past and as it is being\r\nconducted at present by these three companies, I regard as the most\r\ndamnable imposition ever practised upon the people of any nation. Under\r\nthe pretence that it is necessary to enable life-insurance companies to\r\ncarry out their contracts, two million policy-holders are annually\r\ntricked into contributing from their savings sums which not only insure\r\nthe performance of these contracts but enable the officers and\r\ntrustees--mere servants of the policy-holders--to maintain the most\r\ngigantic stock-gambling machine the world has ever known. Through its\r\noperation the companies themselves not only make and lose millions at\r\nsingle throws of the dice, but the bands of schemers whose services it\r\nis pretended are essential for the transaction of the life-insurance\r\nbusiness filch for themselves huge individual fortunes. Piled on to\r\nthese excessive charges are additional amounts which enable these\r\ntricksters to maintain palaces, hotels, bars, and every conceivable kind\r\nof business, to pay for armies of lackeys and employees and private\r\nservants of officers and trustees, and for debauches and banquets which\r\nvie with any given by the kings and queens of the most extravagant and\r\nprofligate nations on earth; in addition, enough more to accumulate huge\r\nand unnecessary funds--which are juggled with for the enrichment of\r\nindividuals. Such wicked exactions and shameful extravagances constitute\r\nan imposition of the most wanton and criminal character, and those\r\nresponsible should be sent to State prison for life, as too vicious and\r\ndangerous to be allowed freedom among an honest people.\r\n\r\nI would say further that the trickery and frauds that have been\r\npractised by the New York Life and the Mutual companies are fully as bad\r\nas, if not worse than, those of the Equitable, now publicly confessed.\r\n\r\n8. It is difficult for me to answer such a question--just as difficult\r\nas it is for the mature man to answer the question of the child, \"If the\r\nmoon is made of green cheese, what kind of rat-traps do they use in\r\nheaven?\" The \"System\" for forty years has taught the people that it is\r\nimpossible for them to improve upon the conditions which the \"System\"\r\nhas moulded for its own plundering purposes, yet I have a simple Remedy,\r\nreadily understood, which I believe the people will eagerly embrace as\r\nsoon as it is given them. This Remedy is adjusted to laws now in force;\r\nand when it is put into operation those who have acquired enormous\r\nfortunes by trickery and fraud will find themselves deprived of their\r\nill-gotten gains by the simple application of natural laws to which the\r\nsaid Remedy affords leverage and action. All honest people, the richest\r\nas well as the poorest, will be benefited in fair and just proportion.\r\nOnce the Remedy is in force, it will be out of the power of the\r\ntrickster and the thief to accumulate overnight scores of millions,\r\nalthough the Edisons, the Stephensons, the Morses, or any man who by\r\nbrain or body does those things for his fellows which they cannot do\r\nfor themselves, will continue to receive that great reward which the\r\nwhole people in their wisdom and generosity decide is fair for\r\nexceptional services; the common miner, too, when he discovers the\r\nhidden gold, silver, or copper in the earth will obtain the same return\r\nthat he is entitled to under to-day's laws, or even better.\r\n\r\n9. This story is written, as I have explained so many times before,\r\nsimply and solely in performance of my duty toward my country and its\r\npeople and without hope or desire for reward of any kind.\r\n\r\n10. I do not own any part of _Everybody's Magazine_, nor have I any\r\nmoney interest in it, directly or indirectly. I have not made a dollar\r\nfrom _Everybody's Magazine_ directly or indirectly, but, on the\r\ncontrary, have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist in\r\ngetting my story into the hands of the people.\r\n\r\n11. Before my first advertisement in December, at a time when I did not\r\nknow how the people would take it, and when I did not know whether\r\nstocks would go up or down, I took my chance in the open of making loss\r\nor profit and did sell large amounts of stock short, making some\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars profit; but when in the middle of the\r\ndisturbance I saw how seriously the people took my message and that\r\nthere might be a great panic, I began to buy, and thereby sacrificed a\r\nmillion of profits. And, since then, that is, after I realized that the\r\npeople would respond to my warnings, I have refrained from going short\r\nin advance of these advertisements, because I desire to keep strictly\r\napart transactions conducted for my own personal account and operations\r\nI am directing for the benefit and safeguarding of the public. I am\r\ndetermined to use every means in my power to keep the people out of a\r\ndangerous market and to concentrate the billions of stocks in the hands\r\nof the \"System,\" and am not actuated by any desire or necessity for\r\ngain. Already the \"System's\" votaries are tottering under their load and\r\nit is certain that in the coming months they will employ every possible\r\nmeans to persuade the public back into their trap. More than ever, then,\r\nis it necessary to be firm against their blandishments, for when the\r\ncrash comes it will be a terrific one, and those who have great\r\nholdings of speculative securities will surely find their values cut in\r\nhalf. Since my first public announcement I have not made enough out of\r\nmarket operations to pay even the expenses of any particular\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n12. I shall not commit any crime; I have too much veneration for the\r\nlaws of our country; although let it be understood that I may, at any\r\ntime, commit what some hireling judge of the \"System\" may call a crime,\r\n_for I am going to call upon the American people to withdraw their\r\ndeposited savings at the proper time; and the proper time will be that\r\ntime when I am absolutely sure they will withdraw them. But I shall not\r\nresort to this last move unless it is certain that the \"System\" cannot\r\nbe crushed in any other way_.\r\n\r\n13. I will first thank God and then proceed to assist in burying the\r\ncorpse of the \"System.\"\r\n\r\n14. The \"System\" will be brought to its knees; stocks will fall to\r\nfigures representing their legitimate values and the public will\r\nreinvest its money therein, and thus regain control of the great\r\ntransportation and industrial interests of the country which the\r\n\"System\" has filched from them.\r\n\r\n15. I say unqualifiedly to the American people that this Remedy of mine\r\nwill, when adopted, correct the greatest evil in the financial system of\r\nthis country. That while it is simple it is absolutely new, and that\r\nneither I nor any one else can possibly benefit moneywise from it except\r\nin the some proportion as all other people in the country benefit.\r\n\r\n16. My Remedy was worked out before 1894, and in that year, one year\r\nbefore I had met any of the \"Standard Oil\" people, it was so far\r\nperfected that in London I laid before Joseph Pulitzer, then and now\r\nowner of the New York _World_, the identical first printed plan that I\r\nwill print in _Everybody's Magazine_ when I judge the people are ready\r\nto receive it.\r\n\r\n17. I unqualifiedly say to you and to the American people that I lost\r\nmillions of dollars more in what you call the Amalgamated swindle than I\r\nmade, and that I lost trying to make good my word to the Amalgamated\r\nsubscribers.\r\n\r\n18. I have spent much more money, hundreds of thousands of dollars\r\nmore, in getting this work, \"Frenzied Finance,\" into the hands of the\r\npeople than I have made through anything in any way connected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIME OF AMALGAMATED\r\n\r\nMany of my readers had difficulty in following the intricacies of the\r\ngreat crime of Amalgamated and I had many letters desiring further\r\nexplanation of that act.\r\n\r\n     PEAKE'S ISLAND, ME., May 31, 1905.\r\n\r\n     T. W. LAWSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: Have just finished June number of \"Frenzied\r\n     Finance.\"\r\n\r\n     You are running a \"primary class\" of High Finance for\r\n     millions; have been able to follow you up to this number,\r\n     and my apology in writing to you is to state that I don't\r\n     understand this lesson and I believe I am of the average\r\n     intelligence of your readers.\r\n\r\n     I am not clear on the following points, and if you can take\r\n     the time and have the desire to do so, I should be glad to\r\n     have you set my gray matter moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\n     1. Why should subscribers think that a company, who had as\r\n     good a thing as advertised, would sell the entire stock,\r\n     thus giving an opportunity to any financier to gather in\r\n     fifty-one per cent. and practically take away its good\r\n     thing?\r\n\r\n     2. How would it have been possible for you with the\r\n     $5,000,000 from the shares it was originally the plan to\r\n     sell to protect those 50,000 shares on a bear market with\r\n     700,000 shares in Messrs. Rogers and Rockefeller's\r\n     possession?\r\n\r\n     3. Why would it not have been a crime to dispose of only\r\n     50,000 shares when the whole 750,000 were advertised?\r\n\r\n     4. Messrs. Rogers and Rockefeller were the Amalgamated\r\n     Company after purchasing the capital stock from the\r\n     office-boys, were they not?\r\n\r\n     5. If Rogers and Rockefeller paid for their shares, what\r\n     became of the Amalgamated Company's $75,000,000 secured by\r\n     sale of stock?\r\n\r\n     These may sound foolish to you, but I'm interested and\r\n     should like to understand.\r\n\r\n     Permit me to state that I admire your pluck and ability and\r\n     wish you success in your remedy, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully yours,\r\n     (Signed) ----\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\nYour first question is a hard one to answer, as it goes to the very\r\nfoundation of \"the stock-market.\" In the ideal operation of\r\nstock-markets, owners of valuable properties should always allow the\r\npublic to join in their \"good things\" at fair prices, because all who\r\nthus participated would make money and would be ready for the next \"good\r\nthing,\" and so on to the end. On the other hand, if the public were only\r\ninvited into the \"bad things,\" in time they would not come in on\r\nanything, good or bad, and there would be no stock-market. The\r\nfoundation of stock-markets, like all other kinds of markets, is the\r\npublic interest therein--for it is the people who own the great bulk of\r\nthe money in the country, and its aggregate is far beyond the amount\r\nthat the very few rich men possess. Stock-markets are no different, at\r\nleast should be no different, from horse-markets, boot and shoe markets,\r\nor mowing-machine markets. The horse-markets whose dealers sell to their\r\npatrons good horses at fair prices, succeed; those whose dealers offer\r\nonly the \"culls\" and \"no goods,\" fail.\r\n\r\n2. Had I been able to keep 700,000 shares in the hands of Rogers and\r\nRockefeller with but 50,000 in the hands of the public, Rogers and\r\nRockefeller would never have permitted the stock to go down, because\r\nthey would have lost $700,000 at every point drop and by \"bearing\" they\r\ncould make only $50,000 a point drop. Stock schemers never \"bear\" a\r\nstock of which they own a large majority and the public a small\r\nminority.\r\n\r\n3. It would have been no crime if Rogers and Rockefeller had subscribed\r\nhonestly--that is, according to the advertised terms--for enough to\r\nsecure the stipulated 700,000 shares, because there was nothing in the\r\nconditions which excluded them or any one from subscribing. The crime\r\nwas in the way they obtained the amount thus retained and in their\r\n\"intentions\" subsequently executed, also in the selling of $27,000,000\r\nworth of the stock when they had pledged their word solemnly to me in my\r\ncapacity as protector of the people that they would sell but $5,000,000.\r\n\r\n4. Yes.\r\n\r\n5. The office-boys, equipped with the check of $75,000,000 provided by\r\nthe National City Bank, were organized into a corporation and turned\r\nover to the treasurer of the new corporation the $75,000,000 check in\r\npayment for the capital stock of the company. The company then turned\r\nthis same check over to Rogers and Rockefeller for the mining properties\r\ncomprising the consolidation, for which Rogers and Rockefeller had paid\r\nthirty-nine millions of dollars; then Rogers and Rockefeller paid back\r\nto the office-boys the seventy-five-million check and received from them\r\nthe seventy-five-million stock. The check was returned to the bank by\r\nthe office-boys, who stood where they stood at the beginning of the\r\ntransaction, and canceled. Thus Rogers and Rockefeller at the close of\r\nthe transaction had in their possession the entire capital stock of the\r\nAmalgamated Company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent had even greater difficulties with the problem:\r\n\r\n     May 29, 1905.\r\n\r\n     MR. THOMAS W. LAWSON,\r\n     Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_: The writer of this letter has had much\r\n     experience in literary matters, but does not remember ever\r\n     reading after any one who could hold his interest as you\r\n     can. He is an author himself (though not so well known as\r\n     you), and feels some little ability to measure and\r\n     appreciate not only literary worth, but the intentions of\r\n     the author in hand. From the \"internal evidences\" alone he\r\n     has a settled conviction that you are perfectly honest in\r\n     this crusade, and from the bottom of his heart wishes you\r\n     Godspeed.\r\n\r\n     A few points are certainly not clear to the ordinary reader.\r\n     Closely as I have followed you I cannot see some things as\r\n     you think they should be seen. For instance:\r\n\r\n     1. Just why were you so fearfully wrought up at the thought\r\n     of the public's getting ten millions instead of five? If you\r\n     had such confidence in the gigantic possibilities of\r\n     Amalgamated, why should you not have been glad to let the\r\n     poor suffering public have ten millions, or twenty millions,\r\n     instead of a paltry five millions? Was this hydrophobia of\r\n     yours at the mere suggestion prompted by a perfectly pure or\r\n     by a selfish motive? At the first did _you_ not plan to let\r\n     the public have very much more than this? Was it not your\r\n     thought, I mean, that the public should be in the thing\r\n     about equally with you promoters? Then why not welcome the\r\n     suggestion of Rogers? I do not understand this at all.\r\n\r\n     2. About that \"bogus subscription.\" Did you not all plan to\r\n     do about the same thing? Did you not intend to have Rogers\r\n     put in a towering subscription, large enough to cover the\r\n     situation, and to permit the bank to reject all above the\r\n     five millions to be allowed the public? I believe _you_\r\n     expected Rogers to make it \"genuine\" by really putting it in\r\n     in time, and by laying down his check for the five per\r\n     cent.; but, as you fully expected to realize on the thing so\r\n     quickly, did you not understand that the whole of this\r\n     \"subscription\" would not have to be paid at all, and that\r\n     your \"check\" was after all only technical? If I am right,\r\n     how did this differ so greatly from what Rogers did? Was not\r\n     your avowed object to cheat the public into thinking they\r\n     were to be allowed to subscribe to seventy-five millions,\r\n     when actually you were only going to let them subscribe to\r\n     five? And if, on that last day, you knew the subscriptions\r\n     were pouring in in such a flood, and knew that offers of a\r\n     big premium were then being made, how in the world did the\r\n     idea of letting the outside public have twenty millions or\r\n     so (on which to immediately realize this premium) seem so\r\n     abhorrent to you, when you professed to be looking after\r\n     their interests?\r\n\r\n     The more I think of these points, the more mixed I become,\r\n     and I think many, very many of your readers are in the same\r\n     boat. Your illustration of the horse-race does not clear the\r\n     matter a particle. It certainly does appear on the face of\r\n     the facts you present that the people who did not get any\r\n     stock were the lucky ones, whether Rogers's precise action\r\n     was criminal or not. You say yourself that it would have\r\n     been good all round if you had pricked the bubble that\r\n     night--that is, if you had then and there prevented anybody\r\n     from getting any premiums, from buying or selling a share.\r\n     Then in the name of reason, why was it not really good for\r\n     those who were rejected, that they were left out?\r\n\r\n     3. Now, in plain language, brief and straight, what would\r\n     you have deemed the right thing, that night at the bank?\r\n     With hundreds of millions subscribed, how many shares would\r\n     you have thought the public should have? How many do you\r\n     think now? And how should the balance have been kept for you\r\n     promoters? Perhaps in answering this you will make it plain.\r\n\r\n     Sincerely yours,\r\n     (Signed) ----\r\n\r\nIn answer to Question 1, I said: All my dealings had been conducted on\r\nthe basis of selling to the public a fair amount of the first section of\r\nthe consolidation and I had no tremors as to consequences. I knew that\r\nwhatever allotment was made them would be worth all they were to pay for\r\nit, for I was personally familiar with the value of the properties of\r\nwhich the section was to be composed. When Mr. Rogers, as I have\r\nexplained in my story, substituted, under circumstances that rendered me\r\ndefenceless, an entirely new set of mines for those programmed for the\r\nfirst section--properties about which I knew only what he told me--from\r\nthat time on my only guarantee against the jugglery and fraud I feared\r\nwas to keep in the hands of Rogers and Rockefeller so large a part of\r\nthis stock that they could play no tricks on the public without\r\nthemselves suffering much more severely. If they regarded the stock as\r\nso valuable a possession that it was a security to be held as \"Standard\r\nOil,\" then their attitude to it guaranteed its value, and no harm could\r\ncome to any one. When, however, they showed a readiness to part with\r\nmore shares than the number they had promised me they would not go\r\nbeyond, my fears were aroused, for all the contingencies I dreaded at\r\nonce became imminent. Besides, such action was proof positive that in\r\ntheir opinion the mines were not worth the price at which they were\r\nselling them. Later on, when I had practical evidence that they were\r\nunloading and proof positive that they were juggling the stock, I felt\r\ncertain that these facts constituted proof positive that they had lied\r\nto me about the cost and worth of the Amalgamated mines.\r\n\r\nMy answer to Question 1 practically disposes of part of Question 2, and\r\nmy replies to the other inquiries above take care of another part.\r\n\r\nI did expect Mr. Rogers to make an honest subscription for that part of\r\nthe stock which we were to retain and which I was doing all in my power\r\nto have him retain, not because I desired to hold all of the good thing\r\nand so cheat the public, but because I did not think it safe for the\r\npublic to hold so many shares that it would be to Rogers's and\r\nRockefeller's interest to \"bear\" prices later and take shares away from\r\nthe holders at slaughter prices. In one sense it was not fair to lead\r\npeople to imagine that they were being offered $75,000,000 of an issue\r\nwhen as a matter of fact they were really offered only $5,000,000, but\r\nif only $5,000,000 were offered no harm could come to them, because\r\nevery one who got some of it would make a profit, and those who received\r\nnone would not suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL COMMON AND PREFERRED\r\n\r\nA definite accusation of misrepresentation was presented in a letter\r\nthat came to me early in the year in criticism of Steel facts and\r\nfigures I had used in illustrating the artificial advance and depression\r\nof stocks:\r\n\r\n     CINCINNATI, O., January 24, 1905.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS W. LAWSON.\r\n\r\n     _Sir_: Lawson, you are both a fakir and a fool. A fakir\r\n     because you misrepresent, and a fool because you do not\r\n     begin to understand the people.\r\n\r\n     When you said the stockholders of the Steel Corporation lost\r\n     $500,000,000, you knew that you lied. Because the difference\r\n     in price of the stock to-day and when it was quoted on the\r\n     New York Stock Exchange for the first time in 1901 does not\r\n     approach that amount. I say that you knew this when you made\r\n     that statement, but you thought and hoped that the general\r\n     public would not be posted in the matter.\r\n\r\n     The whole substance of your magazine articles has been\r\n     nothing but half-truths, and a half-truth is worse than a\r\n     lie. You know that it is to gratify your personal spite, and\r\n     not to help the general public, that you have engaged in\r\n     your frenzied writings. The public is wiser than you think,\r\n     although your conceit has blinded you to that fact.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully,\r\n     F. F. METHVEN.\r\n\r\nThis frenzied nincompoop is evidently ignorant of the fact that\r\n360,281,000 shares of Steel Preferred were sold to the public at over\r\n$100 per share, and that 5,500,000 shares of Steel Common were sold at\r\nover $50 per share, or nearly $300,000,000, and that months later, when\r\nthe people were compelled to resell to the \"System,\" they could get only\r\n$50 for this preferred stock and $10 for the common, while the\r\n$551,000,000 of bonds depreciated in value over $100,000,000 more. What\r\nthis critic desired to say was that, at the present price of Steel\r\nstocks, no such loss as $500,000,000 is shown, which proves my\r\noft-repeated contention--the \"System,\" having \"shaken out\" the public\r\nand acquired their holdings at fifty and ten respectively, is now\r\nengaged in putting the price back to the old figure, intending to repeat\r\nthe robbery process later. A votary of the \"System,\" whom I know quite\r\nwell, said to me a few weeks ago:\r\n\r\n\"Lawson, you keep chasing 'Frenzied Finance' will-o'-the-wisps while the\r\nrest of us are pulling in the dollars, and see where you will come out\r\nin the end. Look what I've done: I sold 200,000 shares of Steel Common\r\nfor $8,000,000. It cost me $3,000,000. I made $5,000,000. I then\r\n'shorted' 100,000 at $50 and bought it back at $12. I made $3,800,000. I\r\nthen bought 300,000 at 10. It's now 30. When I sell out at 40, I shall\r\nhave $9,000,000 more, making $18,000,000, without turning a hair or\r\nrisking a dollar. With prizes such as these a man can stand a lot of\r\nfrenzied hard names, can't he?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY\r\n\r\nAs I have explained on another page of the \"Critics,\" my Remedy cannot\r\nbe dealt with save at considerable length and with living, tangible\r\nillustrations. I have purposely abstained from starting it until I have\r\nthe American public educated to the point of comprehending its value and\r\nappreciating its practicability so far as to be ready to put it into\r\noperation. During the year I have had thousands of letters in regard to\r\nit, the following being a fair example:\r\n\r\n     TOPEKA, KAN., January 5, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sirs_: I have followed Mr. Lawson's article very\r\n     closely and, as I understand it, he intimates that he has a\r\n     remedy for the rotten condition of affairs now prevailing.\r\n     What I, and many more of your readers, would like to know\r\n     is, whether Mr. Lawson, in offering a remedy, is taking into\r\n     consideration the 22,000,000 people of the country who\r\n     neither invest in stocks nor hold any amount of insurance,\r\n     or is his remedy meant merely to protect the four million\r\n     small capitalists from being eaten up by what he terms the\r\n     \"System.\"\r\n\r\n     It is very evident to some of us that if he cannot show us\r\n     how to protect the great majority of the people who,\r\n     although they are not even small capitalists, are the ones\r\n     who are really footing the bills, his remedy will not be the\r\n     grand success he anticipates.\r\n\r\n     J. P. FERRITER.\r\n\r\nMy Remedy will benefit the whole American people. It will help most the\r\nman who nowadays in America deserves most to be helped--the producer,\r\nwho to-day is exchanging the efforts of all his working hours for the\r\nbare necessities of himself and family; not those bare necessities which\r\nthe white slaves of Europe are ground down to believe are their only\r\nrequirements, but those which the free and enlightened American\r\nbelieves, and has taught his family to believe, should be his\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to benefit most the man who has nothing left over after\r\npaying his bills Saturday night but the terrors of not being able to\r\nmeet them the coming week. It would indeed be a parody on a Remedy if it\r\ndid not bring relief to this class.\r\n\r\nNext, my Remedy will benefit that great middle class whose savings go to\r\nmake up the billions in the savings-banks, national banks, trust and\r\ninsurance companies, which are used by the \"System\" to secure for\r\nthemselves a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand per cent. interest on\r\n_their_ capital, while the owners of these billions must be content with\r\ntwo and a half to four per cent. per annum; and\r\n\r\nNext, it will benefit that class which possesses large fortunes honestly\r\nacquired, inasmuch as it will enable them to know what there is behind\r\ntheir investments. None but those who have plundered the\r\npeople--acquired overnight fortunes many times larger than any honest\r\nlifetime efforts could possibly bring--can possibly be hurt by the\r\napplication of my Remedy.\r\n\r\nYou are right--any remedy which would do other than what mine proposes\r\nto do would be a farce.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Transcriber's Notes:                                         |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Page vi: Scheheherezade _sic_                                |\r\n  | Page 40: Missing \"l\" added to \"loser\" in Footnote 2          |\r\n  | Page 59: guerilla _sic_                                      |\r\n  | Page 62: dumfounded _sic_                                    |\r\n  | Page 64: villany _sic_                                       |\r\n  | Page 99: gayly _sic_                                         |\r\n  | Page 107: Machiavelian _sic_                                 |\r\n  | Page 134: Machiavelian _sic_                                 |\r\n  | Page 154: \"slighest\" amended to \"slightest\"                  |\r\n  | Page 175: Comma added after \"perjury\" in Footnote 12         |\r\n  | Page 193: \"metres\" amended to \"meters\"                       |\r\n  | Page 277: dumfounded _sic_                                   |\r\n  | Page 289: Opening quotes added to \"Every one of us....\"      |\r\n  | Page 348: millionnaire _sic_                                 |\r\n  | Page 352: Comma added after \"defalcation\"                    |\r\n  | Page 388: milllionnaire's _sic_                              |\r\n  | Page 447: cohoots _sic_                                      |\r\n  | Page 471: \"very rich men\" amended to \"very rich man\"         |\r\n  | Page 478: haling _sic_                                       |\r\n  | Page 482: Corea and Porto Rico _sic_                         |\r\n  | Page 490: \"managment\" amended to \"management\"                |\r\n  | Page 548: \"insuarnce\" amended to \"insurance\"                 |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Hyphenation has generally been standardized.
