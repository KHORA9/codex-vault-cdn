Taft\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***\r\n\r\nDates of addresses by William H. Taft in this eBook:\r\n\r\n  December 7, 1909\r\n  December 6, 1910\r\n  December 5, 1911\r\n  December 3, 1912\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam H. Taft\r\nDecember 7, 1909\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with all foreign governments have\r\ncontinued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding, and are\r\nvery generally satisfactory.\r\n\r\nEUROPE.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the provisions of the general treaty of arbitration concluded\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain, April 4, 1908, a special\r\nagreement was entered into between the two countries on January 27, 1909,\r\nfor the submission of questions relating to the fisheries on the North\r\nAtlantic Coast to a tribunal to be formed from members of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration at The Hague.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the special agreement the printed case\r\nof each Government was, on October 4 last, submitted to the other and to\r\nthe Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague, and the counter case of the United\r\nStates is now in course of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe American rights under the fisheries article of the Treaty of 1818 have\r\nbeen a cause of difference between the United States and Great Britain for\r\nnearly seventy years. The interests involved are of great importance to the\r\nAmerican fishing industry, and the final settlement of the controversy will\r\nremove a source of constant irritation and complaint. This is the first\r\ncase involving such great international questions which has been submitted\r\nto the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and Great Britain concerning the\r\nCanadian International boundary, concluded April 11, 1908, authorizes the\r\nappointment of two commissioners to define and mark accurately the\r\ninternational boundary line between the United States and the Dominion of\r\nCanada in the waters of the Passamaquoddy Bay, and provides for the\r\nexchange of briefs within the period of six months. The briefs were duly\r\npresented within the prescribed period, but as the commissioners failed to\r\nagree within six months after the exchange of the printed statements, as\r\nrequired by the treaty, it has now become necessary to resort to the\r\narbitration provided for in the article.\r\n\r\nThe International Fisheries Commission appointed pursuant to and under the\r\nauthority of the Convention of April 11, 1908, between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, has completed a system of uniform and common\r\ninternational regulations for the protection and preservation of the food\r\nfishes in international boundary waters of the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe regulations will be duly submitted to Congress with a view to the\r\nenactment of such legislation as will be necessary under the convention to\r\nput them into operation.\r\n\r\nThe Convention providing for the settlement of international differences\r\nbetween the United States and Canada, including the apportionment between\r\nthe two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to adjust certain other questions, signed on the 11th day of\r\nJanuary, 1909, and to the ratification of which the Senate gave its advice\r\nand consent on March 3, 1909, has not yet been ratified on the part of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nCommissioners have been appointed on the part of the United States to act\r\njointly with Commissioners on the part of Canada in examining into the\r\nquestion of obstructions in the St. John River between Maine and New\r\nBrunswick, and to make recommendations for the regulation of the uses\r\nthereof, and are now engaged in this work.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for an international conference to consider and reach an\r\narrangement providing for the preservation and protection of the fur seals\r\nin the North Pacific are in progress with the Governments of Great Britain,\r\nJapan, and Russia. The attitude of the Governments interested leads me to\r\nhope for a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome\r\nof the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe Second Peace Conference recently held at The Hague adopted a convention\r\nfor the establishment of an International Prize Court upon the joint\r\nproposal of delegations of the United States, France, Germany and Great\r\nBritain. The law to be observed by the Tribunal in the decision of prize\r\ncases was, however, left in an uncertain and therefore unsatisfactory\r\nstate. Article 7 of the Convention provided that the Court was to be\r\ngoverned by the provisions of treaties existing between the belligerents,\r\nbut that \"in the absence of such provisions, the court shall apply the\r\nrules of international law. If no generally recognized rule exists, the\r\ncourt shall give judgment in accordance with the general principles of\r\njustice and equity.\" As, however, many questions in international maritime\r\nlaw are understood differently and therefore interpreted differently in\r\nvarious countries, it was deemed advisable not to intrust legislative\r\npowers to the proposed court, but to determine the rules of law properly\r\napplicable in a Conference of the representative maritime nations. Pursuant\r\nto an invitation of Great Britain a conference was held at London from\r\nDecember 2, 1908, to February 26, 1909, in which the following Powers\r\nparticipated: the United States, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Great\r\nBritain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain. The conference\r\nresulted in the Declaration of London, unanimously agreed to and signed by\r\nthe participating Powers, concerning among other matters, the highly\r\nimportant subjects of blockade, contraband, the destruction of neutral\r\nprizes, and continuous voyages. The declaration of London is an eminently\r\nsatisfactory codification of the international maritime law, and it is\r\nhoped that its reasonableness and fairness will secure its general\r\nadoption, as well as remove one of the difficulties standing in the way of\r\nthe establishment of an International Prize Court.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority given in the sundry civil appropriation act, approved\r\nMarch 4, 1909, the United States was represented at the International\r\nConference on Maritime Law at Brussels. The Conference met on the 28th of\r\nSeptember last and resulted in the signature ad referendum of a convention\r\nfor the unification of certain regulations with regard to maritime\r\nassistance and salvage and a convention for the unification of certain\r\nrules with regard to collisions at sea. Two new projects of conventions\r\nwhich have not heretofore been considered in a diplomatic conference,\r\nnamely, one concerning the limitation of the responsibility of shipowners,\r\nand the other concerning marine mortgages and privileges, have been\r\nsubmitted by the Conference to the different governments.\r\n\r\nThe Conference adjourned to meet again on April 11, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference for the purpose of promoting uniform\r\nlegislation concerning letters of exchange, which was called by the\r\nGovernment of the Netherlands to meet at The Hague in September, 1909, has\r\nbeen postponed to meet at that capital in June, 1910. The United States\r\nwill be appropriately represented in this Conference under the provision\r\ntherefor already made by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe cordial invitation of Belgium to be represented by a fitting display of\r\nAmerican progress in the useful arts and inventions at the World's Fair to\r\nbe held at Brussels in 1910 remains to be acted upon by the Congress.\r\nMindful of the advantages to accrue to our artisans and producers in\r\ncompetition with their Continental rivals, I renew the recommendation\r\nheretofore made that provision be made for acceptance of the invitation and\r\nadequate representation in the Exposition. The question arising out of the\r\nBelgian annexation of the Independent State of the Congo, which has so long\r\nand earnestly preoccupied the attention of this Government and enlisted the\r\nsympathy of our best citizens, is still open, but in a more hopeful stage.\r\nThis Government was among the foremost in the great work of uplifting the\r\nuncivilized regions of Africa and urging the extension of the benefits of\r\ncivilization, education, and fruitful open commerce to that vast domain,\r\nand is a party to treaty engagements of all the interested powers designed\r\nto carry out that great duty to humanity. The way to better the original\r\nand adventitious conditions, so burdensome to the natives and so\r\ndestructive to their development, has been pointed out, by observation and\r\nexperience, not alone of American representatives, but by cumulative\r\nevidence from all quarters and by the investigations of Belgian Agents. The\r\nannounced programmes of reforms, striking at many of the evils known to\r\nexist, are an augury of better things. The attitude of the United States is\r\none of benevolent encouragement, coupled with a hopeful trust that the good\r\nwork, responsibly undertaken and zealously perfected to the accomplishment\r\nof the results so ardently desired, will soon justify the wisdom that\r\ninspires them and satisfy the demands of humane sentiment throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA convention between the United States and Germany, under which the\r\nnonworking provisions of the German patent law are made inapplicable to the\r\npatents of American citizens, was concluded on February 23, 1909, and is\r\nnow in force. Negotiations for similar conventions looking to the placing\r\nof American inventors on the same footing as nationals have recently been\r\ninitiated with other European governments whose laws require the local\r\nworking of foreign patents.\r\n\r\nUnder an appropriation made at the last session of the Congress, a\r\ncommission was sent on American cruisers to Monrovia to investigate the\r\ninterests of the United States and its citizens in Liberia. Upon its\r\narrival at Monrovia the commission was enthusiastically received, and\r\nduring its stay in Liberia was everywhere met with the heartiest\r\nexpressions of good will for the American Government and people and the\r\nhope was repeatedly expressed on all sides that this Government might see\r\nits way clear to do something to relieve the critical position of the\r\nRepublic arising in a measure from external as well as internal and\r\nfinancial embarrassments. The Liberian Government afforded every facility\r\nto the Commission for ascertaining the true state of affairs. The\r\nCommission also had conferences with representative citizens, interested\r\nforeigners and the representatives of foreign governments in Monrovia.\r\nVisits were made to various parts of the Republic and to the neighboring\r\nBritish colony of Sierra Leone, where the Commission was received by and\r\nconferred with the Governor.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the interest of the United States in the\r\nRepublic of Liberia springs from the historical fact of the foundation of\r\nthe Republic by the colonization of American citizens of the African race.\r\nIn an early treaty with Liberia there is a provision under which the United\r\nStates may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this\r\nprovision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States\r\nto Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend\r\nassistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence\r\nthe Commission was sent.\r\n\r\nThe report of our commissioners has just been completed and is now under\r\nexamination by the Department of State. It is hoped that there may result\r\nsome helpful measures, in which case it may be my duty again to invite your\r\nattention to this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian Government, by a note addressed on January 26, 1909, to the\r\nDepartment of State, conveyed an invitation to the Government of the United\r\nStates to take part in a conference which it is understood will be held in\r\nFebruary or March, 1910, for the purpose of devising means to remedy\r\nexisting conditions in the Spitzbergen Islands.\r\n\r\nThis invitation was conveyed under the reservation that the question of\r\naltering the status of the islands as countries belonging to no particular\r\nState, and as equally open to the citizens and subjects of all States,\r\nshould not be raised.\r\n\r\nThe European Powers invited to this Conference by the Government of Norway\r\nwere Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State, in view of proofs filed with it in 1906, showing\r\nthe American possession, occupation, and working of certain coal-bearing\r\nlands in Spitzbergen, accepted the invitation under the reservation above\r\nstated, and under the further reservation that all interests in those\r\nislands already vested should be protected and that there should be\r\nequality of opportunity for the future. It was further pointed out that\r\nmembership in the Conference on the part of the United States was qualified\r\nby the consideration that this Government would not become a signatory to\r\nany conventional arrangement concluded by the European members of the\r\nConference which would imply contributory participation by the United\r\nStates in any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of any\r\nscheme of administration which might be devised by the Conference for the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nTHE NEAR EAST.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty Mehmed V, Sultan of Turkey, recently sent to this country a\r\nspecial embassy to announce his accession. The quick transition of the\r\nGovernment of the Ottoman Empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a\r\nconstitutional government with a Parliament and with progressive modern\r\npolicies of reform and public improvement is one of the important phenomena\r\nof our times. Constitutional government seems also to have made further\r\nadvance in Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the\r\nNear East. In that quarter the prestige of the United States has spread\r\nwidely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and\r\nmissionaries. There is every reason why we should obtain a greater share of\r\nthe commerce of the Near East since the conditions are more favorable now\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\nLATIN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest events in recent Pan-American diplomacy was the\r\npacific, independent settlement by the Governments of Bolivia and Peru of a\r\nboundary difference between them, which for some weeks threatened to cause\r\nwar and even to entrain embitterments affecting other republics less\r\ndirectly concerned. From various quarters, directly or indirectly\r\nconcerned, the intermediation of the United States was sought to assist in\r\na solution of the controversy. Desiring at all times to abstain from any\r\nundue mingling in the affairs of sister republics and having faith in the\r\nability of the Governments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to settle their\r\ndifferences in a manner satisfactory to themselves which, viewed with\r\nmagnanimity, would assuage all embitterment, this Government steadily\r\nabstained from being drawn into the controversy and was much gratified to\r\nfind its confidence justified by events.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of July next there will open at Buenos Aires the Fourth\r\nPan-American Conference. This conference will have a special meaning to the\r\nhearts of all Americans, because around its date are clustered the\r\nanniversaries of the independence of so many of the American republics. It\r\nis not necessary for me to remind the Congress of the political, social and\r\ncommercial importance of these gatherings. You are asked to make liberal\r\nappropriation for our participation. If this be granted, it is my purpose\r\nto appoint a distinguished and representative delegation, qualified\r\nfittingly to represent this country and to deal with the problems of\r\nintercontinental interest which will there be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic will also hold from May to November, 1910, at Buenos\r\nAires, a great International Agricultural Exhibition in which the United\r\nStates has been invited to participate. Considering the rapid growth of the\r\ntrade of the United States with the Argentine Republic and the cordial\r\nrelations existing between the two nations, together with the fact that it\r\nprovides an opportunity to show deference to a sister republic on the\r\noccasion of the celebration of its national independence, the proper\r\nDepartments of this Government are taking steps to apprise the interests\r\nconcerned of the opportunity afforded by this Exhibition, in which\r\nappropriate participation by this country is so desirable. The designation\r\nof an official representative is also receiving consideration.\r\n\r\nTo-day, more than ever before, American capital is seeking investment in\r\nforeign countries, and American products are more and more generally\r\nseeking foreign markets. As a consequence, in all countries there are\r\nAmerican citizens and American interests to be protected, on occasion, by\r\ntheir Government. These movements of men, of capital, and of commodities\r\nbring peoples and governments closer together and so form bonds of peace\r\nand mutual dependency, as they must also naturally sometimes make passing\r\npoints of friction. The resultant situation inevitably imposes upon this\r\nGovernment vastly increased responsibilities. This Administration, through\r\nthe Department of State and the foreign service, is lending all proper\r\nsupport to legitimate and beneficial American enterprises in foreign\r\ncountries, the degree of such support being measured by the national\r\nadvantages to be expected. A citizen himself can not by contract or\r\notherwise divest himself of the right, nor can this Government escape the\r\nobligation, of his protection in his personal and property rights when\r\nthese are unjustly infringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless\r\nvexations it is proper that in considering whether American enterprise\r\nshould be encouraged or supported in a particular country, the Government\r\nshould give full weight not only to the national, as opposed to the\r\nindividual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the\r\nGovernment of the country in question is in its administration and in its\r\ndiplomacy faithful to the principles of moderation, equity and justice upon\r\nwhich alone depend international credit, in diplomacy as well as in\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nThe Pan-American policy of this Government has long been fixed in its\r\nprinciples and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the\r\nUnited States and of the Republics to the south of us, most of which have\r\ngreat natural resources, stable government and progressive ideals, the\r\napprehension which gave rise to the Monroe Doctrine may be said to have\r\nnearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other\r\ndoctrine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the\r\nperpetuation of irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations,\r\nor the insidious allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBeside the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have\r\ngrown up a realization of political interests, community of institutions\r\nand ideals, and a flourishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly\r\nstrengthened as time goes on and increased facilities, such as the great\r\nbank soon to be established in Latin America, supply the means for building\r\nup the colossal intercontinental commerce of the future.\r\n\r\nMy meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both American\r\nand Mexican soil served, I hope, to signalize the close and cordial\r\nrelations which so well bind together this Republic and the great Republic\r\nimmediately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of\r\nmaterial interests.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our\r\nrelations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and\r\nthat, under the enlightened regime now directing the Government of\r\nVenezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case\r\nbefore The Hague Tribunal. On July 30, 1909, the Government of Panama\r\nagreed, after considerable negotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the\r\nAmerican officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them\r\nhaving, indeed, been killed by the Panaman police this year.\r\n\r\nThe sincere desire of the Government of Panama to do away with a situation\r\nwhere such an accident could occur is manifest in the recent request in\r\ncompliance with which this Government has lent the services of an officer\r\nof the Army to be employed by the Government of Panama as Instructor of\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary improvements and public works undertaken in Cuba prior to the\r\npresent administration of that Government, in the success of which the\r\nUnited States is interested under the treaty, are reported to be making\r\ngood progress and since the Congress provided for the continuance of the\r\nreciprocal commercial arrangement between Cuba and the United States\r\nassurance has been received that no negotiations injuriously affecting the\r\nsituation will be undertaken without consultation. The collection of the\r\ncustoms of the Dominican Republic through the general receiver of customs\r\nappointed by the President of the United States in accordance with the\r\nconvention of February 8, 1907, has proceeded in an uneventful and\r\nsatisfactory manner. The customs receipts have decreased owing to disturbed\r\npolitical and economic conditions and to a very natural curtailment of\r\nimports in view of the anticipated revision of the Dominican tariff\r\nschedule. The payments to the fiscal agency fund for the service of the\r\nbonded debt of the Republic, as provided by the convention, have been\r\nregularly and promptly made, and satisfactory progress has been made in\r\ncarrying out the provisions of the convention looking towards the\r\ncompletion of the adjustment of the debt and the acquirement by the\r\nDominican Government of certain concessions and monopolies which have been\r\na burden to the commerce of the country. In short, the receivership has\r\ndemonstrated its ability, even under unfavorable economic and political\r\nconditions, to do the work for which it was intended.\r\n\r\nThis Government was obliged to intervene diplomatically to bring about\r\narbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery Company against\r\nNicaragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A\r\nsettlement of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a\r\nprotocol on September 18, 1909.\r\n\r\nMany years ago diplomatic intervention became necessary to the protection\r\nof the interests in the American claim of Alsop and Company against the\r\nGovernment of Chile. The Government of Chile had frequently admitted\r\nobligation in the case and had promised this Government to settle. There\r\nhad been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which\r\nfailed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the\r\nrecent diplomatic negotiations, the Governments of the United States and of\r\nChile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial\r\nand friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a\r\nprotocol to submit the controversy to definitive settlement by His\r\nBritannic Majesty, Edward VII.\r\n\r\nSince the Washington Conventions of 1907 were communicated to the\r\nGovernment of the United States as a consulting and advising party, this\r\nGovernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another, and\r\nin turn by all the five Central American Republics, to exert itself for the\r\nmaintenance of the Conventions. Nearly every complaint has been against the\r\nZelaya Government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant\r\ntension or turmoil. The responses made to the representations of Central\r\nAmerican Republics, as due from the United States on account of its\r\nrelation to the Washington Conventions, have been at all times conservative\r\nand have avoided, so far as possible, any semblance of interference,\r\nalthough it is very apparent that the considerations of geographic\r\nproximity to the Canal Zone and of the very substantial American interests\r\nin Central America give to the United States a special position in the zone\r\nof these Republics and the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nI need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this Government to promote\r\npeace and welfare among these Republics, efforts which are fully\r\nappreciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests.\r\nIt would be no less unnecessary to rehearse here the sad tale of\r\nunspeakable barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by\r\nthe Zelaya Government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of\r\nPresident Zelaya himself. They were reported to have been regularly\r\ncommissioned officers in the organized forces of a revolution which had\r\ncontinued many weeks and was in control of about half of the Republic, and\r\nas such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations,\r\nthey were entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nAt the date when this message is printed this Government has terminated\r\ndiplomatic relations with the Zelaya Government, for reasons made public in\r\na communication to the former Nicaraguan charge d'affaires, and is\r\nintending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with\r\nits dignity, its duty to American interests, and its moral obligations to\r\nCentral America and to civilization. It may later be necessary for me to\r\nbring this subject to the attention of the Congress in a special message.\r\n\r\nThe International Bureau of American Republics has carried on an important\r\nand increasing work during the last year. In the exercise of its peculiar\r\nfunctions as an international agency, maintained by all the American\r\nRepublics for the development of Pan-American commerce and friendship, it\r\nhas accomplished a great practical good which could be done in the same way\r\nby no individual department or bureau of one government, and is therefore\r\ndeserving of your liberal support. The fact that it is about to enter a new\r\nbuilding, erected through the munificence of an American philanthropist and\r\nthe contributions of all the American nations, where both its efficiency of\r\nadministration and expense of maintenance will naturally be much augmented,\r\nfurther entitles it to special consideration.\r\n\r\nTHE FAR EAST.\r\n\r\nIn the Far East this Government preserves unchanged its policy of\r\nsupporting the principle of equality of opportunity and scrupulous respect\r\nfor the integrity of the Chinese Empire, to which policy are pledged the\r\ninterested Powers of both East and West.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of 1903 China has undertaken the abolition of likin with a\r\nmoderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with\r\ncurrency reform. These reforms being of manifest advantage to foreign\r\ncommerce as well as to the interests of China, this Government is\r\nendeavoring to facilitate these measures and the needful acquiescence of\r\nthe treaty Powers. When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be\r\nhypothecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project,\r\nit was obvious that the Governments whose nationals held this loan would\r\nhave a certain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by China\r\nof the reforms in question. Because this railroad loan represented a\r\npractical and real application of the open door policy through cooperation\r\nwith China by interested Powers as well as because of its relations to the\r\nreforms referred to above, the Administration deemed American participation\r\nto be of great national interest. Happily, when it was as a matter of broad\r\npolicy urgent that this opportunity should not be lost, the indispensable\r\ninstrumentality presented itself when a group of American bankers, of\r\ninternational reputation and great resources, agreed at once to share in\r\nthe loan upon precisely such terms as this Government should approve. The\r\nchief of those terms was that American railway material should be upon an\r\nexact equality with that of the other nationals joining in the loan in the\r\nplacing of orders for this whole railroad system. After months of\r\nnegotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. It\r\nis gratifying that Americans will thus take their share in this extension\r\nof these great highways of trade, and to believe that such activities will\r\ngive a real impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to\r\nour historic policy in the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chinese Government in pursuance of its decision to devote\r\nfunds from the portion of the indemnity remitted by the United States to\r\nthe sending of students to this country has already completed arrangements\r\nfor carrying out this purpose, and a considerable body of students have\r\narrived to take up their work in our schools and universities. No one can\r\ndoubt the happy effect that the associations formed by these representative\r\nyoung men will have when they return to take up their work in the\r\nprogressive development of their country.\r\n\r\nThe results of the Opium Conference held at Shanghai last spring at the\r\ninvitation of the United States have been laid before the Government. The\r\nreport shows that China is making remarkable progress and admirable efforts\r\ntoward the eradication of the opium evil and that the Governments concerned\r\nhave not allowed their commercial interests to interfere with a helpful\r\ncooperation in this reform. Collateral investigations of the opium question\r\nin this country lead me to recommend that the manufacture, sale and use of\r\nopium and its derivatives in the United States should be so far as possible\r\nmore rigorously controlled by legislation.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Chinese-Japanese Conventions of September 4 of this year\r\nthere was a provision which caused considerable public apprehension in that\r\nupon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a\r\nmonopoly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Mukden\r\nRailroads, and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enterprise,\r\nto take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a\r\nthorough examination of the Conventions and of the several contextual\r\ndocuments, the Secretary of State reached the conclusion that no such\r\nmonopoly was intended or accomplished. However, in view of the widespread\r\ndiscussion of this question, to confirm the view it had reached, this\r\nGovernment made inquiry of the Imperial Chinese and Japanese Governments\r\nand received from each official assurance that the provision had no purpose\r\ninconsistent with the policy of equality of opportunity to which the\r\nsignatories, in common with the United States, are pledged.\r\n\r\nOur traditional relations with the Japanese Empire continue cordial as\r\nusual. As the representative of Japan, His Imperial Highness Prince Kuni\r\nvisited the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. The recent visit of a delegation of\r\nprominent business men as guests of the chambers of commerce of the Pacific\r\nslope, whose representatives had been so agreeably received in Japan, will\r\ndoubtless contribute to the growing trade across the Pacific, as well as to\r\nthat mutual understanding which leads to mutual appreciation. The\r\narrangement of 1908 for a cooperative control of the coming of laborers to\r\nthe United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a\r\nrevision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which\r\nis terminable in 1912 is already receiving the study of both countries.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State is considering the revision in whole or in part, of\r\nthe existing treaty with Siam, which was concluded in 1856, and is now, in\r\nrespect to many of its provisions, out of date.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to the favorable action of the Congress the estimates\r\nsubmitted by the Department of State and most especially the legislation\r\nsuggested in the Secretary of State's letter of this date whereby it will\r\nbe possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the\r\nDepartment upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly efficient\r\ninstrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American\r\ninterests abroad. The plan to have Divisions of Latin-American and Far\r\nEastern Affairs and to institute a certain specialization in business with\r\nEurope and the Near East will at once commend itself. These\r\npolitico-geographical divisions and the detail from the diplomatic or\r\nconsular service to the Department of a number of men, who bring to the\r\nstudy of complicated problems in different parts of the world practical\r\nknowledge recently gained on the spot, clearly is of the greatest advantage\r\nto the Secretary of State in foreseeing conditions likely to arise and in\r\nconducting the great variety of correspondence and negotiation. It should\r\nbe remembered that such facilities exist in the foreign offices of all the\r\nleading commercial nations and that to deny them to the Secretary of State\r\nwould be to place this Government at a great disadvantage in the rivalry of\r\ncommercial competition.\r\n\r\nThe consular service has been greatly improved under the law of April 5,\r\n1906, and the Executive Order of June 27, 1906, and I commend to your\r\nconsideration the question of embodying in a statute the principles of the\r\npresent Executive Order upon which the efficiency of our consular service\r\nis wholly dependent.\r\n\r\nIn modern times political and commercial interests are interrelated, and in\r\nthe negotiation of commercial treaties, conventions and tariff agreements,\r\nthe keeping open of opportunities and the proper support of American\r\nenterprises, our diplomatic service is quite as important as the consular\r\nservice to the business interests of the country. Impressed with this idea\r\nand convinced that selection after rigorous examination, promotion for\r\nmerit solely and the experience only to be gained through the continuity of\r\nan organized service are indispensable to a high degree of efficiency in\r\nthe diplomatic service, I have signed an Executive Order as the first step\r\ntoward this very desirable result. Its effect should be to place all\r\nsecretaries in the diplomatic service in much the same position as consular\r\nofficers are now placed and to tend to the promotion of the most efficient\r\nto the grade of minister, generally leaving for outside appointments such\r\nposts of the grade of ambassador or minister as it may be expedient to fill\r\nfrom without the service. It is proposed also to continue the practice\r\ninstituted last summer of giving to all newly appointed secretaries at\r\nleast one month's thorough training in the Department of State before they\r\nproceed to their posts. This has been done for some time in regard to the\r\nconsular service with excellent results.\r\n\r\nUnder a provision of the Act of August 5, 1909, I have appointed three\r\nofficials to assist the officers of the Government in collecting\r\ninformation necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of August\r\n5, 1909. As to questions of customs administration they are cooperating\r\nwith the officials of the Treasury Department and as to matters of the\r\nneeds and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters, with the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, in its relation to the domestic aspect of\r\nthe subject of foreign commerce. In the study of foreign tariff treatment\r\nthey will assist the Bureau of Trade Relations of the Department of State.\r\nIt is hoped thus to coordinate and bring to bear upon this most important\r\nsubject all the agencies of the Government which can contribute anything to\r\nits efficient handling.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of Section 2 of the tariff act of August 5, 1909, it\r\nbecomes the duty of the Secretary of State to conduct as diplomatic\r\nbusiness all the negotiations necessary to place him in a position to\r\nadvise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly discriminates\r\nagainst the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. The\r\ngreat scope and complexity of this work, as well as the obligation to lend\r\nall proper aid to our expanding commerce, is met by the expansion of the\r\nBureau of Trade Relations as set forth in the estimates for the Department\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nOTHER DEPARTMENTS.\r\n\r\nI have thus in some detail described the important transactions of the\r\nState Department since the beginning of this Administration for the reason\r\nthat there is no provision either by statute or custom for a formal report\r\nby the Secretary of State to the President or to Congress, and a\r\nPresidential message is the only means by which the condition of our\r\nforeign relations is brought to the attention of Congress and the public.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the affairs of the other Departments, the heads of which\r\nall submit annual reports, I shall touch only those matters that seem to me\r\nto call for special mention on my part without minimizing in any way the\r\nrecommendations made by them for legislation affecting their respective\r\nDepartments, in all of which I wish to express my general concurrence.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important question presented to this Administration is\r\nthat of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The deficit of\r\nthe last fiscal year, and the certain deficit of the current year, prompted\r\nCongress to throw a greater responsibility on the Executive and the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute.\r\nThis declaration imposes upon the Secretary of the Treasury the duty of\r\nassembling all the estimates of the Executive Departments, bureaus, and\r\noffices, of the expenditures necessary in the ensuing fiscal year, and of\r\nmaking an estimate of the revenues of the Government for the same period;\r\nand if a probable deficit is thus shown, it is made the duty of the\r\nPresident to recommend the method by which such deficit can be met.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the estimated\r\nreceipts by $34,075,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be\r\ndisbursed for the Panama Canal, amounting to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to\r\nbe paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and\r\nexpenditures will be increased to a total deficit of $73,075,620. This\r\ndeficit the Secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to\r\npay the cost of constructing the Panama Canal. I approve this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe policy of paying for the construction of the Panama Canal, not out of\r\ncurrent revenue, but by bond issues, was adopted in the Spooner Act of\r\n1902, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the principle\r\nby which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall\r\nupon our posterity who are to enjoy it; and there is all the more reason\r\nfor this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now\r\nhalf done and which will be completed January 1, 1915, shows that the cost\r\nof engineering and construction will be $297,766,000, instead of\r\n$139,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to engineering and\r\nconstruction, the other expenses, including sanitation and government, and\r\nthe amount paid for the properties, the franchise, and the privilege of\r\nbuilding the canal, increase the cost by $75,435,000, to a total of\r\n$375,201,000. The increase in the cost of engineering and construction is\r\ndue to a substantial enlargement of the plan of construction by widening\r\nthe canal 100 feet in the Culebra cut and by increasing the dimensions of\r\nthe locks, to the underestimate of the quantity of the work to be done\r\nunder the original plan, and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and\r\nmaterials both of which have greatly enhanced in price since the original\r\nestimate was made.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year, I directed the\r\nheads of Departments in the preparation of their estimates to make them as\r\nlow as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity. The\r\nresult has been, as I am advised by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the\r\nestimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1911, are less than the appropriations for this current\r\nfiscal year by $42,818,000. So far as the Secretary of the Treasury is able\r\nto form a judgment as to future income, and compare it with the\r\nexpenditures for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, and excluding\r\npayments on account of the Panama Canal, which will doubtless be taken up\r\nby bonds, there will be a surplus of $35,931,000.\r\n\r\nIn the present estimates the needs of the Departments and of the Government\r\nhave been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption on the part of\r\nCongress, so often made in times past, that the estimates have been\r\nprepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result in\r\nseriously hampering proper administration.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury points out what should be carefully noted in\r\nrespect to this reduction in governmental expenses for the next fiscal\r\nyear, that the economies are of two kinds--first, there is a saving in the\r\npermanent administration of the Departments, bureaus, and offices of the\r\nGovernment; and, second, there is a present reduction in expenses by a\r\npostponement of projects and improvements that ultimately will have to be\r\ncarried out but which are now delayed with the hope that additional revenue\r\nin the future will permit their execution without producing a deficit.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible in the preparation of estimates greatly to reduce\r\nthe cost of permanent administration. This can not be done without a\r\nthorough reorganization of bureaus, offices, and departments. For the\r\npurpose of securing information which may enable the executive and the\r\nlegislative branches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction of the\r\ncost of governmental administration, the Treasury Department has instituted\r\nan investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the\r\nUnited States. The result of his work in two or three bureaus, which, if\r\nextended to the entire Government, must occupy two or more years, has been\r\nto show much room for improvement and opportunity for substantial\r\nreductions in the cost and increased efficiency of administration. The\r\nobject of the investigation is to devise means to increase the average\r\nefficiency of each employee. There is great room for improvement toward\r\nthis end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and departments and in\r\nthe avoidance of duplication, but also in the treatment of the individual\r\nemployee.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system it constantly happens that two employees receive\r\nthe same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important\r\nand exacting than that of the other. Superior ability is not rewarded or\r\nencouraged. As the classification is now entirely by salary, an employee\r\noften rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work, for which\r\nalone he may be fitted. An investigation ordered by my predecessor resulted\r\nin the recommendation that the civil service he reclassified according to\r\nthe kind of work, so that the work requiring most application and knowledge\r\nand ability shall receive most compensation. I believe such a change would\r\nbe fairer to the whole force and would permanently improve the personnel of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nMore than this, every reform directed toward the improvement in the average\r\nefficiency of government employees must depend on the ability of the\r\nExecutive to eliminate from the government service those who are\r\ninefficient from any cause, and as the degree of efficiency in all the\r\nDepartments is much lessened by the retention of old employees who have\r\noutlived their energy and usefulness, it is indispensable to any proper\r\nsystem of economy that provision be made so that their separation from the\r\nservice shall be easy and inevitable. It is impossible to make such\r\nprovision unless there is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Most of the\r\ngreat industrial organizations, and many of the well-conducted railways of\r\nthis country, are coming to the conclusion that a system of pensions for\r\nold employees, and the substitution therefor of younger and more energetic\r\nservants, promotes both economy and efficiency of administration.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there is a strong feeling in both Houses of Congress, and\r\npossibly in the country, against the establishment of civil pensions, and\r\nthat this has naturally grown out of the heavy burden of military pensions,\r\nwhich it has always been the policy of our Government to assume; but I am\r\nstrongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficulties\r\npresented by the superannuation of civil servants can be found than that of\r\na system of civil pensions.\r\n\r\nThe business and expenditures of the Government have expanded enormously\r\nsince the Spanish war, but as the revenues have increased in nearly the\r\nsame proportion as the expenditures until recently, the attention of the\r\npublic, and of those responsible for the Government, has not been fastened\r\nupon the question of reducing the cost of administration. We can not, in\r\nview of the advancing prices of living, hope to save money by a reduction\r\nin the standard of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change is made in that\r\nregard, an increase rather than a decrease will be necessary; and the only\r\nmeans of economy will be in reducing the number of employees and in\r\nobtaining a greater average of efficiency from those retained in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nClose investigation and study needed to make definite recommendations in\r\nthis regard will consume at least two years. I note with much satisfaction\r\nthe organization in the Senate of a Committee on Public Expenditures,\r\ncharged with the duty of conducting such an investigation, and I tender to\r\nthat committee all the assistance which the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment can possibly render.\r\n\r\nFRAUDS IN THE COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nI regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the\r\ncollections of the customs revenue at New York City, in which a number of\r\nthe subordinate employees in the weighing and other departments were\r\ndirectly concerned, and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar\r\nRefining Company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on\r\nunderweights of sugar. The Government has recovered from the American Sugar\r\nRefining Company all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum\r\nwas received in full of the amount due, which might have been recovered by\r\ncivil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an express\r\nreservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should\r\nnot interfere with, or prevent the criminal prosecution of everyone who was\r\nfound to be subject to the same.\r\n\r\nCriminal prosecutions are now proceeding against a number of the Government\r\nofficers. The Treasury Department and the Department of Justice are\r\nexerting every effort to discover all the wrongdoers, including the\r\nofficers and employees of the companies who may have been privy to the\r\nfraud. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by Congress\r\nat present, pending the probing by the Treasury Department and the\r\nDepartment of Justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwise\r\nprove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties.\r\n\r\nMAXIMUM AND MINIMUM CLAUSE IN TARIFF ACT.\r\n\r\nTwo features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of\r\nthe clause known as the \"Maximum and Minimum\" clause, it is the duty of the\r\nExecutive to consider the laws and practices of other countries with\r\nreference to the importation into those countries of the products and\r\nmerchandise of the United States, and if the Executive finds such laws and\r\npractices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States, the\r\nminimum duties provided in the bill are to go into force.\r\n\r\nUnless the President makes such a finding, then the maximum duties provided\r\nin the bill, that is, an increase of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem over\r\nthe minimum duties, are to be in force. Fear has been expressed that this\r\npower conferred and duty imposed on the Executive is likely to lead to a\r\ntariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need\r\nbe anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe discretion granted to the Executive by the terms \"unduly\r\ndiscriminatory\" is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged\r\nagainst the imports from a country, it is necessary that he shall find on\r\nthe part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the\r\npractice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the\r\ndiscriminations found shall be undue; that is, without good and fair\r\nreason. I conceive that this power was reposed in the President with the\r\nhope that the maximum duties might never be applied in any case, but that\r\nthe power to apply them would enable the President and the State Department\r\nthrough friendly negotiation to secure the elimination from the laws and\r\nthe practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly\r\ndiscriminatory. No one is seeking a tariff war or a condition in which the\r\nspirit of retaliation shall be aroused.\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE NEW TARIFF BOARD.\r\n\r\nThe new tariff law enables me to appoint a tariff board to assist me in\r\nconnection with the Department of State in the administration of the\r\nminimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the\r\nGovernment in the administration of the entire law. An examination of the\r\nlaw and an understanding of the nature of the facts which should be\r\nconsidered in discharging the functions imposed upon the Executive show\r\nthat I have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive\r\nglossary and encyclopedia of the terms used and articles embraced in the\r\ntariff law, and to secure information as to the cost of production of such\r\ngoods in this country and the cost of their production in foreign\r\ncountries. I have therefore appointed a tariff board consisting of three\r\nmembers and have directed them to perform all the duties above described.\r\nThis work will perhaps take two or three years, and I ask from Congress a\r\ncontinuing annual appropriation equal to that already made for its\r\nprosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility\r\nand importance whenever Congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the\r\ncustoms duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a\r\ncharacter as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the\r\npresent tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as\r\ndescribed in the platform of the successful party at the late election, I\r\nshall not hesitate to invite the attention of Congress to this fact and to\r\nthe necessity for action predicated thereon. Nothing, however, halts\r\nbusiness and interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the\r\nthreatened revision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after\r\ncareful and deliberate investigation, upon which such revision can properly\r\nbe undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of\r\nmisinformation that creeps into arguments pro and con in respect to tariff\r\nrates is such as to require the kind of investigation that I have directed\r\nthe tariff board to make, an investigation undertaken by it wholly without\r\nrespect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a\r\nreadjustment of the rates of duty.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of immediate economy and because of the prospect of a\r\ndeficit, I have required a reduction in the estimates of the War Department\r\nfor the coming fiscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an\r\namount forty-five millions less than the corresponding estimates for last\r\nyear. This could only be accomplished by cutting off new projects and\r\nsuspending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. For\r\nthe same reason I have directed that the Army shall not be recruited up to\r\nits present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than\r\ntemporary--to last until our revenues are in better condition and until the\r\nwhole question of the expediency of adopting a definite military policy can\r\nbe submitted to Congress, for I am sure that the interests of the military\r\nestablishment are seriously in need of careful consideration by Congress.\r\nThe laws regulating the organization of our armed forces in the event of\r\nwar need to be revised in order that the organization can be modified so as\r\nto produce a force which would be more consistently apportioned throughout\r\nits numerous branches. To explain the circumstances upon which this opinion\r\nis based would necessitate a lengthy discussion, and I postpone it until\r\nthe first convenient opportunity shall arise to send to Congress a special\r\nmessage upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War calls attention to a number of needed changes in the\r\nArmy in all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most\r\nemphasis is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which\r\nthe merits of officers shall have some effect upon their advancement and by\r\nwhich the advancement of all may be accelerated by the effective\r\nelimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. There are in\r\nevery army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate\r\ntheir duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or\r\ndismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for\r\nhigh command as to justify their remaining in the active service to be\r\nPromoted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a\r\ncertain proportion of their pay, increasing with their length of service at\r\nthe time of retirement. There is now a personnel law for the Navy which\r\nitself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference. Such a\r\nlaw is needed quite as much for the Army.\r\n\r\nThe coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could\r\nbe desired, and in some respects they are rather more elaborate than under\r\npresent conditions are needed to stop an enemy's fleet from entering the\r\nharbors defended. There is, however, one place where additional defense is\r\nbadly needed, and that is at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, where it is\r\nproposed to make an artificial island for a fort which shall prevent an\r\nenemy's fleet from entering this most important strategical base of\r\noperations on the whole Atlantic and Gulf coasts. I hope that appropriate\r\nlegislation will be adopted to secure the construction of this defense.\r\n\r\nThe military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that it would be\r\nunwise to make the large expenditures which at one time were contemplated\r\nin the establishment of a naval base and station in the Philippine Islands,\r\nand have expressed their judgment, in which I fully concur, in favor of\r\nmaking an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in\r\nthe Philippines. This does not dispense with the necessity for the\r\ncomparatively small appropriations required to finish the proper coast\r\ndefenses in the Philippines now under construction on the island of\r\nCorregidor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair station and\r\ncoaling supply station at Olongapo, where is the floating dock \"Dewey.\" I\r\nhope that this recommendation of the joint board will end the discussion as\r\nto the comparative merits of Manila Bay and Olongapo as naval stations, and\r\nwill lead to prompt measures for the proper equipment and defense of Pearl\r\nHarbor.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY.\r\n\r\nThe return of the battle-ship fleet from its voyage around the world, in\r\nmore efficient condition than when it started, was a noteworthy event of\r\ninterest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world.\r\nBesides the beneficial and far-reaching effect on our personal and\r\ndiplomatic relations in the countries which the fleet visited, the marked\r\nsuccess of the ships in steaming around the world in all weathers on\r\nschedule time has increased respect for our Navy and has added to our\r\nnational prestige.\r\n\r\nOur enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country is young\r\nand energetic and representative of the national spirit. It is, moreover,\r\nowing to its intelligence, capable of quick training into the modern\r\nman-of-warsman. Our officers are earnest and zealous in their profession,\r\nbut it is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the\r\nresponsibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag\r\nrank young enough to obtain adequate training in their duties as flag\r\nofficers. This need for reform in the Navy has been ably and earnestly\r\npresented to Congress by my predecessor, and I also urgently recommend the\r\nsubject for consideration.\r\n\r\nEarly in the coming session a comprehensive plan for the reorganization of\r\nthe officers of all corps of the Navy will be presented to Congress, and I\r\nhope it will meet with action suited to its urgency.\r\n\r\nOwing to the necessity for economy in expenditures, I have directed the\r\ncurtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are\r\nthirty-eight millions less than the corresponding estimates of last year,\r\nand the request for new naval construction is limited to two first-class\r\nbattle ships and one repair vessel.\r\n\r\nThe use of a navy is for military purposes, and there has been found need\r\nin the Department of a military branch dealing directly with the military\r\nuse of the fleet. The Secretary of the Navy has also felt the lack of\r\nresponsible advisers to aid him in reaching conclusions and deciding\r\nimportant matters between coordinate branches of the Department. To secure\r\nthese results he has inaugurated a tentative plan involving certain changes\r\nin the organization of the Navy Department, including the navy-yards, all\r\nof which have been found by the Attorney-General to be in accordance with\r\nlaw. I have approved the execution of the plan proposed because of the\r\ngreater efficiency and economy it promises.\r\n\r\nThe generosity of Congress has provided in the present Naval Observatory\r\nthe most magnificent and expensive astronomical establishment in the world.\r\nIt is being used for certain naval purposes which might easily and\r\nadequately be subserved by a small division connected with the Naval\r\nDepartment at only a fraction of the cost of the present Naval Observatory.\r\nThe official Board of Visitors established by Congress and appointed in\r\n1901 expressed its conclusion that the official head of the observatory\r\nshould be an eminent astronomer appointed by the President by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, holding his place by a tenure at least as\r\npermanent as that of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey or the head of\r\nthe Geological Survey, and not merely by a detail of two or three years'\r\nduration. I fully concur in this judgment, and urge a provision by law for\r\nthe appointment of such a director.\r\n\r\nIt may not be necessary to take the observatory out of the Navy Department\r\nand put it into another department in which opportunity for scientific\r\nresearch afforded by the observatory would seem to be more appropriate,\r\nthough I believe such a transfer in the long run is the best policy. I am\r\nsure, however, I express the desire of the astronomers and those learned in\r\nthe kindred sciences when I urge upon Congress that the Naval Observatory\r\nbe now dedicated to science under control of a man of science who can, if\r\nneed be, render all the service to the Navy Department which this\r\nobservatory now renders, and still furnish to the world the discoveries in\r\nastronomy that a great astronomer using such a plant would be likely to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EXPEDITION IN LEGAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nThe deplorable delays in the administration of civil and criminal law have\r\nreceived the attention of committees of the American Bar Association and of\r\nmany State Bar Associations, as well as the considered thought of judges\r\nand jurists. In my judgment, a change in judicial procedure, with a view to\r\nreducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating\r\nthe dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal\r\ncases, constitutes the greatest need in our American institutions. I do not\r\ndoubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty\r\nexhibited in lynchings is directly due to the uncertainties and injustice\r\ngrowing out of the delays in trials, judgments, and the executions thereof\r\nby our courts. Of course these remarks apply quite as well to the\r\nadministration of justice in State courts as to that in Federal courts, and\r\nwithout making invidious distinction it is perhaps not too much to say\r\nthat, speaking generally, the defects are less in the Federal courts than\r\nin the State courts. But they are very great in the Federal courts. The\r\nexpedition with which business is disposed of both on the civil and the\r\ncriminal side of English courts under modern rules of procedure makes the\r\ndelays in our courts seem archaic and barbarous. The procedure in the\r\nFederal courts should furnish an example for the State courts. I presume it\r\nis impossible, without an amendment to the Constitution, to unite under one\r\nform of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings in equity in\r\nthe Federal courts, but it is certainly not impossible by a statute to\r\nsimplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity\r\nin those courts. It is not impossible to cut down still more than it is cut\r\ndown, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court so as to confine it almost\r\nwholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present\r\nstatutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the Federal courts is under\r\nthe control of the Supreme Court, but in the pressure of business to which\r\nthat court is subjected, it is impossible to hope that a radical and proper\r\nreform of the Federal equity procedure can be brought about. I therefore\r\nrecommend legislation providing for the appointment by the President of a\r\ncommission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the\r\nFederal courts of first instance, the law of appeals from those courts to\r\nthe courts of appeals and to the Supreme Court, and the costs imposed in\r\nsuch procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and\r\nmake recommendation with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure\r\nas far as possible and making it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant\r\nof little means.\r\n\r\nINJUNCTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe platform of the successful party in the last election contained the\r\nfollowing: \"The Republican party will uphold at all times the authority and\r\nintegrity of the courts, State and Federal, and will ever insist that their\r\npowers to enforce their process and to protect life, liberty, and property\r\nshall be preserved inviolate. We believe, however, that the rules of\r\nprocedure in the Federal courts with respect to the issuance of the writ of\r\ninjunction should be more accurately defined by statute, and that no\r\ninjunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice,\r\nexcept where irreparable injury would result from delay, in which case a\r\nspeedy hearing thereafter should be granted.\" I recommend that in\r\ncompliance with the promise thus made, appropriate legislation be adopted.\r\nThe ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint\r\nagainst ill-considered injunctions without notice will be removed by the\r\nenactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction\r\nor restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any Federal court,\r\nwithout previous notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on behalf\r\nof the parties to be enjoined; unless it shall appear to the satisfaction\r\nof the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would\r\nresult in irreparable injury to the complainant and unless also the court\r\nshall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon\r\nthe court minutes, that immediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue\r\nto the complainant, and shall define the injury, state why it is\r\nirreparable, and shall also endorse on the order issued the date and the\r\nhour of the issuance of the order. Moreover, every such injunction or\r\nrestraining order issued without previous notice and opportunity by the\r\ndefendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no\r\neffect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less\r\nthan that period which the court may fix, unless within such seven days or\r\nsuch less period, the injunction or order is extended or renewed after\r\nprevious notice and opportunity to be heard.\r\n\r\nMy judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies the\r\nbest practice in equity and is very like the rule now in force in some\r\ncourts will prevent the issuing of ill-advised orders of injunction without\r\nnotice and will render such orders when issued much less objectionable by\r\nthe short time in which they may remain effective.\r\n\r\nANTI-TRUST AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE LAWS.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the General Government over interstate commerce has led\r\nto the passage of the so-called \"Sherman Anti-trust Law\" and the\r\n\"Interstate Commerce Law\" and its amendments. The developments in the\r\noperation of those laws, as shown by indictments, trials, judicial\r\ndecisions, and other sources of information, call for a discussion and some\r\nsuggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody in a special message\r\ninstead of including them in the present communication, and I shall avail\r\nmyself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nJAIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor transmitted to the Congress a special message on January 11,\r\n1909, accompanying the report of Commissioners theretofore appointed to\r\ninvestigate the jail, workhouse, etc., in the District of Columbia, in\r\nwhich he directed attention to the report as setting forth vividly, \"the\r\nreally outrageous conditions in the workhouse and jail.\"\r\n\r\nThe Congress has taken action in pursuance of the recommendations of that\r\nreport and of the President, to the extent of appropriating funds and\r\nenacting the necessary legislation for the establishment of a workhouse and\r\nreformatory. No action, however, has been taken by the Congress with\r\nrespect to the jail, the conditions of which are still antiquated and\r\ninsanitary. I earnestly recommend the passage of a sufficient appropriation\r\nto enable a thorough remodeling of that institution to be made without\r\ndelay. It is a reproach to the National Government that almost under the\r\nshadow of the Capitol Dome prisoners should be confined in a building\r\ndestitute of the ordinary decent appliances requisite to cleanliness and\r\nsanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. SECOND-CLASS MAIL MATTER.\r\n\r\nThe deficit every year in the Post-Office Department is largely caused by\r\nthe low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second-class mail\r\nmatter, which includes not only newspapers, but magazines and miscellaneous\r\nperiodicals. The actual loss growing out of the transmission of this\r\nsecond-class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $63,000,000 a\r\nyear. The average cost of the transportation of this matter is more than 9\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the average distance over which newspapers are delivered to\r\ntheir customers is 291 miles, while the average haul of magazines is 1,049,\r\nand of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles. Thus, the average haul of the\r\nmagazine is three and one-half times and that of the miscellaneous\r\nperiodical nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet all of\r\nthem pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of 1907\r\nshow that second-class mail matter constituted 63.91 per cent. of the\r\nweight of all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent. of the revenue.\r\n\r\nThe figures given are startling, and show the payment by the Government of\r\nan enormous subsidy to the newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, and\r\nCongress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to\r\nreduce the deficit in the Post-Office Department caused by this discrepancy\r\nbetween the actual cost of transportation and the compensation exacted\r\ntherefor.\r\n\r\nA great saving might be made, amounting to much more than half of the loss,\r\nby imposing upon magazines and periodicals a higher rate of postage. They\r\nare much heavier than newspapers, and contain a much higher proportion of\r\nadvertising to reading matter, and the average distance of their\r\ntransportation is three and a half times as great.\r\n\r\nThe total deficit for the last fiscal year in the Post-Office Department\r\namounted to $17,500,000. The branches of its business which it did at a\r\nloss were the second-class mail service, in which the loss, as already\r\nsaid, was $63,000,000, and the free rural delivery, in which the loss was\r\n$28,000,000. These losses were in part offset by the profits of the letter\r\npostage and other sources of income. It would seem wise to reduce the loss\r\nupon second-class mail matter, at least to the extent of preventing a\r\ndeficit in the total operations of the Post-Office.\r\n\r\nI commend the whole subject to Congress, not unmindful of the spread of\r\nintelligence which a low charge for carrying newspapers and periodicals\r\nassists. I very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which\r\nconstitutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.\r\n\r\nThe second subject worthy of mention in the Post-Office Department is the\r\nreal necessity and entire practicability of establishing postal savings\r\nbanks. The successful party at the last election declared in favor of\r\npostal savings banks, and although the proposition finds opponents in many\r\nparts of the country, I am convinced that the people desire such banks, and\r\nam sure that when the banks are furnished they will be productive of the\r\nutmost good. The postal savings banks are not constituted for the purpose\r\nof creating competition with other banks. The rate of interest upon\r\ndeposits to which they would be limited would be so small as to prevent\r\ntheir drawing deposits away from other banks.\r\n\r\nI believe them to be necessary in order to offer a proper inducement to\r\nthrift and saving to a great many people of small means who do not now have\r\nbanking facilities, and to whom such a system would offer an opportunity\r\nfor the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory\r\nsubstitute, based on sound principle and actual successful trial in nearly\r\nall the countries of the world, for the system of government guaranty of\r\ndeposits now being adopted in several western States, which with deference\r\nto those who advocate it seems to me to have in it the seeds of\r\ndemoralization to conservative banking and certain financial disaster. The\r\nquestion of how the money deposited in postal savings banks shall be\r\ninvested is not free from difficulty, but I believe that a satisfactory\r\nprovision for this purpose was inserted as an amendment to the bill\r\nconsidered by the Senate at its last session. It has been proposed to delay\r\nthe consideration of legislation establishing a postal savings bank until\r\nafter the report of the Monetary Commission. This report is likely to be\r\ndelayed, and properly so, cause of the necessity for careful deliberation\r\nand close investigation. I do not see why the one should be tied up with\r\nthe other. It is understood that the Monetary Commission have looked into\r\nthe systems of banking which now prevail abroad, and have found that by a\r\ncontrol there exercised in respect to reserves and the rates of exchange by\r\nsome central authority panics are avoided. It is not apparent that a system\r\nof postal savings banks would in any way interfere with a change to such a\r\nsystem here. Certainly in most of the countries of Europe where control is\r\nthus exercised by a central authority, postal savings banks exist and are\r\nnot thought to be inconsistent with a proper financial and banking system.\r\n\r\nSHIP SUBSIDY.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course of my distinguished predecessor, I earnestly recommend\r\nto Congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bill, looking\r\nto the establishment of lines between our Atlantic seaboard and the eastern\r\ncoast of South America, as well as lines from the west coast of the United\r\nStates to South America. China, Japan, and the Philippines. The profits on\r\nforeign mails are perhaps a sufficient measure of the expenditures which\r\nmight first be tentatively applied to this method of inducing American\r\ncapital to undertake the establishment of American lines of steamships in\r\nthose directions in which we now feel it most important that we should have\r\nmeans of transportation controlled in the interest of the expansion of our\r\ntrade. A bill of this character has once passed the House and more than\r\nonce passed the Senate, and I hope that at this session a bill framed on\r\nthe same lines and with the same purposes may become a law.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR DEPARTMENT. NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA.\r\n\r\nThe successful party in the last election in its national platform declared\r\nin favor of the admission as separate States of New Mexico and Arizona, and\r\nI recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopted. I urge,\r\nhowever, that care be exercised in the preparation of the legislation\r\naffecting each Territory to secure deliberation in the selection of persons\r\nas members of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming\r\nState, and I earnestly advise that such constitution after adoption by the\r\nconvention shall be submitted to the people of the Territory for their\r\napproval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merits of the\r\nproposed constitution, and if the constitution is defeated by popular vote\r\nmeans shall be provided in the enabling act for a new convention and the\r\ndrafting of a new constitution. I think it vital that the issue as to the\r\nmerits of the constitution should not be mixed up with the selection of\r\nState officers, and that no election of State officers should be had until\r\nafter the constitution has been fully approved and finally settled upon.\r\n\r\nALASKA.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Territory of Alaska, I recommend legislation which\r\nshall provide for the appointment by the President of a governor and also\r\nof an executive council, the members of which shall during their term of\r\noffice reside in the Territory, and which shall have legislative powers\r\nsufficient to enable it to give to the Territory local laws adapted to its\r\npresent growth. I strongly deprecate legislation looking to the election of\r\na Territorial legislature in that vast district. The lack of permanence of\r\nresidence of a large part of the present population and the small number of\r\nthe people who either permanently or temporarily reside in the district as\r\ncompared with its vast expanse and the variety of the interests that have\r\nto be subserved, make it altogether unfitting in my judgment to provide for\r\na popular election of a legislative body. The present system is not\r\nadequate and does not furnish the character of local control that ought to\r\nbe there. The only compromise it seems to me which may give needed local\r\nlegislation and secure a conservative government is the one I propose.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF NATIONAL RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nIn several Departments there is presented the necessity for legislation\r\nlooking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the\r\nsubject is one of such importance as to require a more detailed and\r\nextended discussion than can be entered upon in this communication. For\r\nthat reason I shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to\r\nCongress on the subject of the improvement of our waterways, upon the\r\nreclamation and irrigation of arid, semiarid, and swamp lands; upon the\r\npreservation of our forests and the reforesting of suitable areas; upon the\r\nreclassification of the public domain with a view of separating from\r\nagricultural settlement mineral, coal, and phosphate lands and sites\r\nbelonging to the Government bordering on streams suitable for the\r\nutilization of water power.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nI commend to your careful consideration the report of the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture as showing the immense sphere of usefulness which that\r\nDepartment now fills and the wonderful addition to the wealth of the nation\r\nmade by the farmers of this country in the crops of the current year.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR. THE LIGHT-HOUSE BOARD.\r\n\r\nThe Light-House Board now discharges its duties under the Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor. For upwards of forty years this Board has been\r\nconstituted of military and naval officers and two or three men of science,\r\nwith such an absence of a duly constituted executive head that it is\r\nmarvelous what work has been accomplished. In the period of construction\r\nthe energy and enthusiasm of all the members prevented the inherent defects\r\nof the system from interfering greatly with the beneficial work of the\r\nBoard, but now that the work is chiefly confined to maintenance and repair,\r\nfor which purpose the country is divided into sixteen districts, to which\r\nare assigned an engineer officer of the Army and an inspector of the Navy,\r\neach with a light-house tender and the needed plant for his work, it has\r\nbecome apparent by the frequent friction that arises, due to the absence of\r\nany central independent authority, that there must be a complete\r\nreorganization of the Board. I concede the advantage of keeping in the\r\nsystem the rigidity of discipline that the presence of naval and military\r\nofficers in charge insures, but unless the presence of such officers in the\r\nBoard can be made consistent with a responsible executive head that shall\r\nhave proper authority, I recommend the transfer of control over the\r\nlight-houses to a suitable civilian bureau. This is in accordance with the\r\njudgment of competent persons who are familiar with the workings of the\r\npresent system. I am confident that a reorganization can be effected which\r\nshall avoid the recurrence of friction between members, instances of which\r\nhave been officially brought to my attention, and that by such\r\nreorganization greater efficiency and a substantial reduction in the\r\nexpense of operation can be brought about.\r\n\r\nCONSOLIDATION OF BUREAUS.\r\n\r\nI request Congressional authority to enable the Secretary of Commerce and\r\nLabor to unite the Bureaus of Manufactures and Statistics. This was\r\nrecommended by a competent committee appointed in the previous\r\nadministration for the purpose of suggesting changes in the interest of\r\neconomy and efficiency, and is requested by the Secretary.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE SLAVE TRADE.\r\n\r\nI greatly regret to have to say that the investigations made in the Bureau\r\nof Immigration and other sources of information lead to the view that there\r\nis urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive\r\nactivity to suppress the recruiting of the ranks of prostitutes from the\r\nstreams of immigration into this country--an evil which, for want of a\r\nbetter name, has been called \"The White Slave Trade.\" I believe it to be\r\nconstitutional to forbid, under penalty, the transportation of persons for\r\npurposes of prostitution across national and state lines; and by\r\nappropriating a fund of $50,000 to be used by the Secretary of Commerce and\r\nLabor for the employment of special inspectors it will be possible to bring\r\nthose responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a\r\nfederal law.\r\n\r\nBUREAU OF HEALTH\r\n\r\nFor a very considerable period a movement has been gathering strength,\r\nespecially among the members of the medical profession, in favor of a\r\nconcentration of the instruments of the National Government which have to\r\ndo with the promotion of public health. In the nature of things, the\r\nMedical Department of the Army and the Medical Department of the Navy must\r\nbe kept separate. But there seems to be no reason why all the other bureaus\r\nand offices in the General Government which have to do with the public\r\nhealth or subjects akin thereto should not be united in a bureau to be\r\ncalled the \"Bureau of Public Health.\" This would necessitate the transfer\r\nof the Marine-Hospital Service to such a bureau. I am aware that there is\r\nwide field in respect to the public health committed to the States in which\r\nthe Federal Government can not exercise jurisdiction, but we have seen in\r\nthe Agricultural Department the expansion into widest usefulness of a\r\ndepartment giving attention to agriculture when that subject is plainly one\r\nover which the States properly exercise direct jurisdiction. The\r\nopportunities offered for useful research and the spread of useful\r\ninformation in regard to the cultivation of the soil and the breeding of\r\nstock and the solution of many of the intricate problems in progressive\r\nagriculture have demonstrated the wisdom of establishing that department.\r\nSimilar reasons, of equal force, can be given for the establishment of a\r\nbureau of health that shall not only exercise the police jurisdiction of\r\nthe Federal Government respecting quarantine, but which shall also afford\r\nan opportunity for investigation and research by competent experts into\r\nquestions of health affecting the whole country, or important sections\r\nthereof, questions which, in the absence of Federal governmental work, are\r\nnot likely to be promptly solved.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nThe work of the United States Civil Service Commission has been performed\r\nto the general satisfaction of the executive officers with whom the\r\nCommission has been brought into official communication. The volume of that\r\nwork and its variety and extent have under new laws, such as the Census\r\nAct, and new Executive orders, greatly increased. The activities of the\r\nCommission required by the statutes have reached to every portion of the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThe accommodations of the Commission are most inadequate for its needs. I\r\ncall your attention to its request for increase in those accommodations as\r\nwill appear from the annual report for this year.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\nI urgently recommend to Congress that a law be passed requiring that\r\ncandidates in elections of Members of the House of Representatives, and\r\ncommittees in charge of their candidacy and campaign, file in a proper\r\noffice of the United States Government a statement of the contributions\r\nreceived and of the expenditures incurred in the campaign for such\r\nelections and that similar legislation be enacted in respect to all other\r\nelections which are constitutionally within the control of Congress.\r\n\r\nFREEDMAN'S SAVINGS AND TRUST COMPANY.\r\n\r\nRecommendations have been made by my predecessors that Congress appropriate\r\na sufficient sum to pay the balance--about 38 per cent.--of the amounts due\r\ndepositors in the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company. I renew this\r\nrecommendation, and advise also that a proper limitation be prescribed\r\nfixing a period within which the claims may be presented, that assigned\r\nclaims be not recognized, and that a limit be imposed on the amount of fees\r\ncollectible for services in presenting such claims.\r\n\r\nSEMI-CENTENNIAL OF NEGRO FREEDOM.\r\n\r\nThe year 1913 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the issuance of the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation granting freedom to the negroes. It seems fitting\r\nthat this event should be properly celebrated. Already a movement has been\r\nstarted by prominent Negroes, encouraged by prominent white people and the\r\npress. The South especially is manifesting its interest in this movement.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that a proper form of celebration would be an exposition to\r\nshow the progress the Negroes have made, not only during their period of\r\nfreedom, but also from the time of their coming to this country.\r\n\r\nI heartily indorse this proposal, and request that the Executive be\r\nauthorized to appoint a preliminary commission of not more than seven\r\npersons to consider carefully whether or not it is wise to hold such an\r\nexposition, and if so, to outline a plan for the enterprise. I further\r\nrecommend that such preliminary commission serve without salary, except as\r\nto their actual expenses, and that an appropriation be made to meet such\r\nexpenses. CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI have thus, in a message compressed as much as the subjects will permit,\r\nreferred to many of the legislative needs of the country, with the\r\nexceptions already noted. Speaking generally, the country is in a high\r\nstate of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the\r\neve of a substantial business expansion, and we have just garnered a\r\nharvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products. The\r\nhigh prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming\r\ncommunity, but on the other hand they mean a very considerably increased\r\nburden upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does\r\nnot expand with the improvement in business and the general prosperity.\r\nVarious reasons are given for the high prices. The proportionate increase\r\nin the output of gold, which to-day is the chief medium of exchange and is\r\nin some respects a measure of value, furnishes a substantial explanation of\r\nat least a part of the increase in prices. The increase in population and\r\nthe more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been\r\naccompanied by a proportionate increase in acreage production, may furnish\r\na further reason. It is well to note that the increase in the cost of\r\nliving is not confined to this country, but prevails the world over, and\r\nthat those who would charge increases in prices to the existing protective\r\ntariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost\r\nwholly in those products of the factory and farm in respect to which there\r\nhas been either no increase in the tariff or in many instances a very\r\nconsiderable reduction.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam H. Taft\r\nDecember 6, 1910\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the foreign relations of the United States have\r\ncontinued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding.\r\n\r\nARBITRATION.\r\n\r\nThe year has been notable as witnessing the pacific settlement of two\r\nimportant international controversies before the Permanent Court of The\r\nHague.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration of the Fisheries dispute between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence since the Fisheries Convention of 1818, has given an award\r\nwhich is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration is particularly\r\nnoteworthy not only because of the eminently just results secured, but also\r\nbecause it is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration\r\ntreaty of April 4, 1908, between the United States and Great Britain, and\r\ndisposes of a controversy the settlement of which has resisted every other\r\nresource of diplomacy, and which for nearly ninety years has been the cause\r\nof friction between two countries whose common interest lies in maintaining\r\nthe most friendly and cordial relations with each other.\r\n\r\nThe United States was ably represented before the tribunal. The complicated\r\nhistory of the questions arising made the issue depend, more than\r\nordinarily in such cases, upon the care and skill with which our case was\r\npresented, and I should be wanting in proper recognition of a great\r\npatriotic service if I did not refer to the lucid historical analysis of\r\nthe facts and the signal ability and force of the argument--six days in\r\nlength--presented to the Court in support of our case by Mr. Elihu Root. As\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Root had given close study to the intricate facts\r\nbearing on the controversy, and by diplomatic correspondence had helped to\r\nframe the issues. At the solicitation of the Secretary of State and myself,\r\nMr. Root, though burdened by his duties as Senator from New York, undertook\r\nthe preparation of the case as leading counsel, with the condition imposed\r\nby himself that, in view of his position as Senator, he should not receive\r\nany compensation.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal constituted at The Hague by the Governments of the United\r\nStates and Venezuela has completed its deliberations and has rendered an\r\naward in the case of the Orinoco Steamship Company against Venezuela. The\r\naward may be regarded as satisfactory since it has, pursuant to the\r\ncontentions of the United States, recognized a number of important\r\nprinciples making for a judicial attitude in the determining of\r\ninternational disputes.\r\n\r\nIn view of grave doubts which had been raised as to the constitutionality\r\nof The Hague Convention for the establishment of an International Prize\r\nCourt, now before the Senate for ratification, because of that provision of\r\nthe Convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed\r\nCourt from the decisions of national courts, this government proposed in an\r\nIdentic Circular Note addressed to those Powers who had taken part in the\r\nLondon Maritime Conference, that the powers signatory to the Convention, if\r\nconfronted with such difficulty, might insert a reservation to the effect\r\nthat appeals to the International Prize Court in respect to decisions of\r\nits national tribunals, should take the form of a direct claim for\r\ncompensation; that the proceedings thereupon to be taken should be in the\r\nform of a trial de novo, and that judgment of the Court should consist of\r\ncompensation for the illegal capture, irrespective of the decision of the\r\nnational court whose judgment had thus been internationally involved. As\r\nthe result of an informal discussion it was decided to provide such\r\nprocedure by means of a separate protocol which should be ratified at the\r\nsame time as the Prize Court Convention itself.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Government of the Netherlands, at the request of this\r\nGovernment, proposed under date of May 24, 1910, to the powers signatory to\r\nThe Hague Convention, the negotiation of a supplemental protocol embodying\r\nstipulations providing for this alternative procedure. It is gratifying to\r\nobserve that this additional protocol is being signed without objection, by\r\nthe powers signatory to the original convention, and there is every reason\r\nto believe that the International Prize Court will be soon established.\r\n\r\nThe Identic Circular Note also proposed that the International Prize Court\r\nwhen established should be endowed with the functions of an Arbitral Court\r\nof Justice under and pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the last\r\nHague Conference. The replies received from the various powers to this\r\nproposal inspire the hope that this also may be accomplished within the\r\nreasonably near future.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the establishment of these two tribunals will go a long\r\nway toward securing the arbitration of many questions which have heretofore\r\nthreatened and, at times, destroyed the peace of nations.\r\n\r\nPEACE COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nAppreciating these enlightened tendencies of modern times, the Congress at\r\nits last session passed a law providing for the appointment of a commission\r\nof five members \"to be appointed by the President of the United States to\r\nconsider the expediency of utilizing existing international agencies for\r\nthe purpose of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by\r\ninternational agreement, and of constituting the combined navies of the\r\nworld an international force for the preservation of universal peace, and\r\nto consider and report upon any other means to diminish the expenditures of\r\ngovernment for military purposes and to lessen the probabilities of war.\"\r\n\r\nI have not as yet made appointments to this Commission because I have\r\ninvited and am awaiting the expressions of foreign governments as to their\r\nwillingness to cooperate with us in the appointment of similar commissions\r\nor representatives who would meet with our commissioners and by joint\r\naction seek to make their work effective.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN AND CANADA.\r\n\r\nSeveral important treaties have been negotiated with Great Britain in the\r\npast twelve months. A preliminary diplomatic agreement has been reached\r\nregarding the arbitration of pecuniary claims which each Government has\r\nagainst the other. This agreement, with the schedules of claims annexed,\r\nwill, as soon as the schedules are arranged, be submitted to the Senate for\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nAn agreement between the United States and Great Britain with regard to the\r\nlocation of the international boundary line between the United States and\r\nCanada in Passamaquoddy Bay and to the middle of Grand Manan Channel was\r\nreached in a Treaty concluded May 21, 1910, which has been ratified by both\r\nGovernments and proclaimed, thus making unnecessary the arbitration\r\nprovided for in the previous treaty of April 11, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe Convention concluded January 11, 1909, between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain providing for the settlement of international differences\r\nbetween the United States and Canada including the apportionment between\r\nthe two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of\r\nCommissioners to adjust certain other questions has been ratified by both\r\nGovernments and proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe work of the International Fisheries Commission appointed in 1908, under\r\nthe treaty of April 11, 1908, between Great Britain and the United States,\r\nhas resulted in the formulation and recommendation of uniform regulations\r\ngoverning the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and the United\r\nStates for the purpose of protecting and increasing the supply of food fish\r\nin such waters. In completion of this work, the regulations agreed upon\r\nrequire congressional legislation to make them effective and for their\r\nenforcement in fulfillment of the treaty stipulations. PORTUGAL.\r\n\r\nIn October last the monarchy in Portugal was overthrown, a provisional\r\nRepublic was proclaimed, and there was set up a de facto Government which\r\nwas promptly recognized by the Government of the United States for purposes\r\nof ordinary intercourse pending formal recognition by this and other Powers\r\nof the Governmental entity to be duly established by the national\r\nsovereignty. LIBERIA.\r\n\r\nA disturbance among the native tribes of Liberia in a portion of the\r\nRepublic during the early part of this year resulted in the sending, under\r\nthe Treaty of 1862, of an American vessel of war to the disaffected\r\ndistrict, and the Liberian authorities, assisted by the good offices of the\r\nAmerican Naval Officers, were able to restore order. The negotiations which\r\nhave been undertaken for the amelioration of the conditions found in\r\nLiberia by the American Commission, whose report I transmitted to Congress\r\non March 25 last, are being brought to conclusion, and it is thought that\r\nwithin a short time practical measures of relief may be put into effect\r\nthrough the good offices of this Government and the cordial cooperation of\r\nother governments interested in Liberia's welfare.\r\n\r\nTHE NEAR EAST. TURKEY.\r\n\r\nTo return the visit of the Special Embassy announcing the accession of His\r\nMajesty Mehemet V, Emperor of the Ottomans, I sent to Constantinople a\r\nSpecial Ambassador who, in addition to this mission of ceremony, was\r\ncharged with the duty of expressing to the Ottoman Government the value\r\nattached by the Government of the United States to increased and more\r\nimportant relations between the countries and the desire of the United\r\nStates to contribute to the larger economic and commercial development due\r\nto the new regime in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development now beginning in that ancient empire and the marked\r\nprogress and increased commercial importance of Bulgaria, Roumania, and\r\nServia make it particularly opportune that the possibilities of American\r\ncommerce in the Near East should receive due attention. MONTENEGRO.\r\n\r\nThe National Skoupchtina having expressed its will that the Principality of\r\nMontenegro be raised to the rank of Kingdom, the Prince of Montenegro on\r\nAugust 15 last assumed the title of King of Montenegro. It gave me pleasure\r\nto accord to the new kingdom the recognition of the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE FAR EAST.\r\n\r\nThe center of interest in Far Eastern affairs during the past year has\r\nagain been China.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the negotiations for a loan to the Chinese\r\nGovernment for the construction of the trunk railway lines from Hankow\r\nsouthward to Canton and westward through the Yangtse Valley, known as the\r\nHukuang Loan, were concluded by the representatives of the various\r\nfinancial groups in May last and the results approved by their respective\r\ngovernments. The agreement, already initialed by the Chinese Government, is\r\nnow awaiting formal ratification. The basis of the settlement of the terms\r\nof this loan was one of exact equality between America, Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Germany in respect to financing the loan and supplying\r\nmaterials for the proposed railways and their future branches.\r\n\r\nThe application of the principle underlying the policy of the United States\r\nin regard to the Hukuang Loan, viz., that of the internationalization of\r\nthe foreign interest in such of the railways of China as may be financed by\r\nforeign countries, was suggested on a broader scale by the Secretary of\r\nState in a proposal for internationalization and commercial neutralization\r\nof all the railways of Manchuria. While the principle which led to the\r\nproposal of this Government was generally admitted by the powers to whom it\r\nwas addressed, the Governments of Russia and Japan apprehended practical\r\ndifficulties in the execution of the larger plan which prevented their\r\nready adherence. The question of constructing the Chinchow-Aigun railway by\r\nmeans of an international loan to China is, however, still the subject of\r\nfriendly discussion by the interested parties.\r\n\r\nThe policy of this Government in these matters has been directed by a\r\ndesire to make the use of American capital in the development of China an\r\ninstrument in the promotion of China's welfare and material prosperity\r\nwithout prejudice to her legitimate rights as an independent political\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThis policy has recently found further exemplification in the assistance\r\ngiven by this Government to the negotiations between China and a group of\r\nAmerican bankers for a loan of $50,000,000 to be employed chiefly in\r\ncurrency reform. The confusion which has from ancient times existed in the\r\nmonetary usages of the Chinese has been one of the principal obstacles to\r\ncommercial intercourse with that people. The United States in its Treaty of\r\n1903 with China obtained a pledge from the latter to introduce a uniform\r\nnational coinage, and the following year, at the request of China, this\r\nGovernment sent to Peking a member of the International Exchange\r\nCommission, to discuss with the Chinese Government the best methods of\r\nintroducing the reform. In 1908 China sent a Commissioner to the United\r\nStates to consult with American financiers as to the possibility of\r\nsecuring a large loan with which to inaugurate the new currency system, but\r\nthe death of Their Majesties, the Empress Dowager and the Emperor of China,\r\ninterrupted the negotiations, which were not resumed until a few months\r\nago, when this Government was asked to communicate to the bankers concerned\r\nthe request of China for a loan of $50,000,000 for the purpose under\r\nreview. A preliminary agreement between the American group and China has\r\nbeen made covering the loan.\r\n\r\nFor the success of this loan and the contemplated reforms which are of the\r\ngreatest importance to the commercial interests of the United States and\r\nthe civilized world at large, it is realized that an expert will be\r\nnecessary, and this Government has received assurances from China that such\r\nan adviser, who shall be an American, will be engaged.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of interest to Americans to note the success which is\r\nattending the efforts of China to establish gradually a system of\r\nrepresentative government. The provincial assemblies were opened in\r\nOctober, 1909, and in October of the present year a consultative body, the\r\nnucleus of the future national parliament, held its first session at\r\nPeking.\r\n\r\nThe year has further been marked by two important international agreements\r\nrelating to Far Eastern affairs. In the Russo-Japanese Agreement relating\r\nto Manchuria, signed July 4, 1910, this Government was gratified to note an\r\nassurance of continued peaceful conditions in that region and the\r\nreaffirmation of the policies with respect to China to which the United\r\nStates together with all other interested powers are alike solemnly\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nThe treaty annexing Korea to the Empire of Japan, promulgated August 29,\r\n1910, marks the final step in a process of control of the ancient empire by\r\nher powerful neighbor that has been in progress for several years past. In\r\ncommunicating the fact of annexation the Japanese Government gave to the\r\nGovernment of the United States assurances of the full protection of the\r\nrights of American citizens in Korea under the changed conditions.\r\n\r\nFriendly visits of many distinguished persons from the Far East have been\r\nmade during the year. Chief among these were Their Imperial Highnesses\r\nPrinces Tsai-tao and Tsai-Hsun of China; and His Imperial Highness Prince\r\nHigashi Fushimi, and Prince Tokugawa, President of the House of Peers of\r\nJapan. The Secretary of War has recently visited Japan and China in\r\nconnection with his tour to the Philippines, and a large delegation of\r\nAmerican business men are at present traveling in China. This exchange of\r\nfriendly visits has had the happy effect of even further strengthening our\r\nfriendly international relations.\r\n\r\nLATIN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year several of our southern sister Republics celebrated\r\nthe one hundredth anniversary of their independence. In honor of these\r\nevents, special embassies were sent from this country to Argentina, Chile,\r\nand Mexico, where the gracious reception and splendid hospitality extended\r\nthem manifested the cordial relations and friendship existing between those\r\ncountries and the United States, relations which I am happy to believe have\r\nnever before been upon so high a plane and so solid a basis as at present.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional commission appointed under a concurrent resolution to\r\nattend the festivities celebrating the centennial anniversary of Mexican\r\nindependence, together with a special ambassador, were received with the\r\nhighest honors and with the greatest cordiality, and returned with the\r\nreport of the bounteous hospitality and warm reception of President Diaz\r\nand the Mexican people, which left no doubt of the desire of the\r\nimmediately neighboring Republic to continue the mutually beneficial and\r\nintimate relations which I feel sure the two governments will ever\r\ncherish.\r\n\r\nAt the Fourth Pan-American Conference which met in Buenos Aires during July\r\nand August last, after seven weeks of harmonious deliberation, three\r\nconventions were signed providing for the regulation of trade-marks,\r\npatents, and copyrights, which when ratified by the different Governments,\r\nwill go far toward furnishing to American authors, patentees, and owners of\r\ntrade-marks the protection needed in localities where heretofore it has\r\nbeen either lacking or inadequate. Further, a convention for the\r\narbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of important\r\nresolutions passed. The Conventions will in due course be transmitted to\r\nthe Senate, and the report of the Delegation of the United States will be\r\ncommunicated to the Congress for its information. The special cordiality\r\nbetween representative men from all parts of America which was shown at\r\nthis Conference cannot fail to react upon and draw still closer the\r\nrelations between the countries which took part in it.\r\n\r\nThe International Bureau of American Republics is doing a broad and useful\r\nwork for Pan American commerce and comity. Its duties were much enlarged by\r\nthe International Conference of American States at Buenos Aires and its\r\nname was shortened to the more practical and expressive term of Pan\r\nAmerican Union. Located now in its new building, which was specially\r\ndedicated April 26 of this year to the development of friendship, trade and\r\npeace among the American nations, it has improved instrumentalities to\r\nserve the twenty-two republics of this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that the action of the United States in its desire to\r\nremove imminent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growing out of a\r\nboundary dispute, with the cooperation of Brazil and the Argentine Republic\r\nas joint mediators with this Government, has already resulted successfully\r\nin preventing war. The Government of Chile, while not one of the mediators,\r\nlent effective aid in furtherance of a preliminary agreement likely to lead\r\non to an amicable settlement, and it is not doubted that the good offices\r\nof the mediating Powers and the conciliatory cooperation of the Governments\r\ndirectly interested will finally lead to a removal of this perennial cause\r\nof friction between Ecuador and Peru. The inestimable value of cordial\r\ncooperation between the sister republics of America for the maintenance of\r\npeace in this hemisphere has never been more clearly shown than in this\r\nmediation, by which three American Governments have given to this\r\nhemisphere the honor of first invoking the most far-reaching provisions of\r\nThe Hague Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes.\r\n\r\nThere has been signed by the representatives of the United States and\r\nMexico a protocol submitting to the United States-Mexican Boundary\r\nCommission (whose membership for the purpose of this case is to be\r\nincreased by the addition of a citizen of Canada) the question of\r\nsovereignty over the Chamizal Tract which lies within the present physical\r\nboundaries of the city of E1 Paso, Tex. The determination of this question\r\nwill remove a source of no little annoyance to the two Governments.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Honduras has for many years been burdened with a heavy\r\nbonded debt held in Europe, the interest on which long ago fell in arrears.\r\nFinally conditions were such that it became imperative to refund the debt\r\nand place the finances of the Republic upon a sound basis. Last year a\r\ngroup of American bankers undertook to do this and to advance funds for\r\nrailway and other improvements contributing directly to the country's\r\nprosperity and commerce--an arrangement which has long been desired by this\r\nGovernment. Negotiations to this end have been under way for more than a\r\nyear and it is now confidently believed that a short time will suffice to\r\nconclude an arrangement which will be satisfactory to the foreign\r\ncreditors, eminently advantageous to Honduras, and highly creditable to the\r\njudgment and foresight of the Honduranean Government. This is much to be\r\ndesired since, as recognized by the Washington Conventions, a strong\r\nHonduras would tend immensely to the progress and prosperity of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Republic of Nicaragua has been the scene of\r\ninternecine struggle. General Zelaya, for seventeen years the absolute\r\nruler of Nicaragua, was throughout his career the disturber of Central\r\nAmerica and opposed every plan for the promotion of peace and friendly\r\nrelations between the five republics. When the people of Nicaragua were\r\nfinally driven into rebellion by his lawless exactions, he violated the\r\nlaws of war by the unwarranted execution of two American citizens who had\r\nregularly enlisted in the ranks of the revolutionists. This and other\r\noffenses made it the duty of the American Government to take measures with\r\na view to ultimate reparation and for the safeguarding of its interests.\r\nThis involved the breaking off of all diplomatic relations with the Zelaya\r\nGovernment for the reasons laid down in a communication from the Secretary\r\nof State, which also notified the contending factions in Nicaragua that\r\nthis Government would hold each to strict accountability for outrages on\r\nthe rights of American citizens. American forces were sent to both coasts\r\nof Nicaragua to be in readiness should occasion arise to protect Americans\r\nand their interests, and remained there until the war was over and peace\r\nhad returned to that unfortunate country. These events, together with\r\nZelaya's continued exactions, brought him so clearly to the bar of public\r\nopinion that he was forced to resign and to take refuge abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned communication of the Secretary of State to the\r\nCharge d'Affaires of the Zelaya Government, the opinion was expressed that\r\nthe revolution represented the wishes of the majority of the Nicaraguan\r\npeople. This has now been proved beyond doubt by the fact that since the\r\ncomplete overthrow of the Madriz Government and the occupation of the\r\ncapital by the forces of the revolution, all factions have united to\r\nmaintain public order and as a result of discussion with an Agent of this\r\nGovernment, sent to Managua at the request of the Provisional Government,\r\ncomprehensive plans are being made for the future welfare of Nicaragua,\r\nincluding the rehabilitation of public credit. The moderation and\r\nconciliatory spirit shown by the various factions give ground for the\r\nconfident hope that Nicaragua will soon take its rightful place among the\r\nlaw-abiding and progressive countries of the world.\r\n\r\nIt gratifies me exceedingly to announce that the Argentine Republic some\r\nmonths ago placed with American manufacturers a contract for the\r\nconstruction of two battle-ships and certain additional naval equipment.\r\nThe extent of this work and its importance to the Argentine Republic make\r\nthe placing of the bid an earnest of friendly feeling toward the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTARIFF NEGOTIATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe new tariff law, in section 2, respecting the maximum and minimum\r\ntariffs of the United States, which provisions came into effect on April 1,\r\n1910, imposed upon the President the responsibility of determining prior to\r\nthat date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the\r\nUnited States and its products in any country of the world with which we\r\nsustained commercial relations.\r\n\r\nIn the case of several countries instances of apparent undue discrimination\r\nagainst American commerce were found to exist. These discriminations were\r\nremoved by negotiation. Prior to April 1, 1910, when the maximum tariff was\r\nto come into operation with respect to importations from all those\r\ncountries in whose favor no proclamation applying the minimum tariff should\r\nbe issued by the President, one hundred and thirty-four such proclamations\r\nwere issued. This series of proclamations embraced the entire commercial\r\nworld, and hence the minimum tariff of the United States has been given\r\nuniversal application, thus testifying to the satisfactory character of our\r\ntrade relations with foreign countries.\r\n\r\nMarked advantages to the commerce of the United States were obtained\r\nthrough these tariff settlements. Foreign nations are fully cognizant of\r\nthe fact that under section 2 of the tariff act the President is required,\r\nwhenever he is satisfied that the treatment accorded by them to the\r\nproducts of the United States is not such as to entitle them to the\r\nbenefits of the minimum tariff of the United States, to withdraw those\r\nbenefits by proclamation giving ninety days' notice, after which the\r\nmaximum tariff will apply to their dutiable products entering the United\r\nStates. In its general operation this section of the tariff law has thus\r\nfar proved a guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there are\r\nunfortunately instances where foreign governments deal arbitrarily with\r\nAmerican interests within their jurisdiction in a manner injurious and\r\ninequitable.\r\n\r\nThe policy of broader and closer trade relations with the Dominion of\r\nCanada which was initiated in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum\r\nprovisions of the Tariff Act of August, 1909, has proved mutually\r\nbeneficial. It justifies further efforts for the readjustment of the\r\ncommercial relations of the two countries so that their commerce may follow\r\nthe channels natural to contiguous countries and be commensurate with the\r\nsteady expansion of trade and industry on both sides of the boundary line.\r\nThe reciprocation on the part of the Dominion Government of the sentiment\r\nwhich was expressed by this Government was followed in October by the\r\nsuggestion that it would be glad to have the negotiations, which had been\r\ntemporarily suspended during the summer, resumed. In accordance with this\r\nsuggestion the Secretary of State, by my direction, dispatched two\r\nrepresentatives of the Department of State as special commissioners to\r\nOttawa to confer with representatives of the Dominion Government. They were\r\nauthorized to take such steps for formulating a reciprocal trade agreement\r\nas might be necessary and to receive and consider any propositions which\r\nthe Dominion Government might care to submit.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the instructions issued conferences were held by these\r\ncommissioners with officials of the Dominion Government at Ottawa in the\r\nearly part of November.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were conducted on both sides in a spirit of mutual\r\naccommodation. The discussion of the common commercial interests of the two\r\ncountries had for its object a satisfactory basis for a trade arrangement\r\nwhich offers the prospect of a freer interchange for the products of the\r\nUnited States and of Canada. The conferences were adjourned to be resumed\r\nin Washington in January, when it is hoped that the aspiration of both\r\nGovernments for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nFOSTERING FOREIGN TRADE.\r\n\r\nAll these tariff negotiations, so vital to our commerce and industry, and\r\nthe duty of jealously guarding the equitable and just treatment of our\r\nproducts, capital, and industry abroad devolve upon the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine battle-ship contracts, like the subsequent important one for\r\nArgentine railway equipment, and those for Cuban Government vessels, were\r\nsecured for our manufacturers largely through the good offices of the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of that Department to secure for citizens of the United States\r\nequal opportunities in the markets of the world and to expand American\r\ncommerce have been most successful. The volume of business obtained in new\r\nfields of competition and upon new lines is already very great and Congress\r\nis urged to continue to support the Department of State in its endeavors\r\nfor further trade expansion.\r\n\r\nOur foreign trade merits the best support of the Government and the most\r\nearnest endeavor of our manufacturers and merchants, who, if they do not\r\nalready in all cases need a foreign market, are certain soon to become\r\ndependent on it. Therefore, now is the time to secure a strong position in\r\nthis field.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN BRANCH BANKS ABROAD.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this subject without emphasizing the necessity of such\r\nlegislation as will make possible and convenient the establishment of\r\nAmerican banks and branches of American banks in foreign countries. Only by\r\nsuch means can our foreign trade be favorably financed, necessary credits\r\nbe arranged, and proper avail be made of commercial opportunities in\r\nforeign countries, and most especially in Latin America.\r\n\r\nAID TO OUR FOREIGN MERCHANT MARINE.\r\n\r\nAnother instrumentality indispensable to the unhampered and natural\r\ndevelopment of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and\r\ncommercial nations recognize the importance of this factor. The greatest\r\ncommercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant\r\nmarine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for rapid and direct mail, passenger\r\nand freight communication quite so urgent as between the United States and\r\nLatin America. We can secure in no other quarter of the world such\r\nimmediate benefits in friendship and commerce as would flow from the\r\nestablishment of direct lines Of communication with the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica adequate to meet the requirements of a rapidly increasing\r\nappreciation of the reciprocal dependence of the countries of the Western\r\nHemisphere upon each other's products, sympathies and assistance.\r\n\r\nI alluded to this most important subject in my last annual message; it has\r\noften been before you and I need not recapitulate the reasons for its\r\nrecommendation. Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama\r\nCanal will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail in\r\ninternational maritime business of this great improvement in the means of\r\nthe world's commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nQuite aside from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant marine,\r\nwhere can we find the seafaring population necessary as a natural naval\r\nreserve and where could we find, in case of war, the transports and\r\nsubsidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without a body? For\r\nmany reasons I cannot too strongly urge upon the Congress the passage of a\r\nmeasure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee the\r\nestablishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine, and the\r\nrestoration of the American flag to its ancient place upon the seas.\r\n\r\nOf course such aid ought only to be given under conditions of publicity of\r\neach beneficiary's business and accounts which would show that the aid\r\nreceived was needed to maintain the trade and was properly used for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL PROTECTION TO ALIENS.\r\n\r\nWith our increasing international intercourse, it becomes incumbent upon me\r\nto repeat more emphatically than ever the recommendation which I made in my\r\nInaugural Address that Congress shall at once give to the Courts of the\r\nUnited States jurisdiction to punish as a crime the violation of the rights\r\nof aliens secured by treaty with the United States, in order that the\r\ngeneral government of the United States shall be able, when called upon by\r\na friendly nation, to redeem its solemn promise by treaty to secure to the\r\ncitizens or subjects of that nation resident in the United States, freedom\r\nfrom violence and due process of law in respect to their life, liberty and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMERIT SYSTEM FOR DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE.\r\n\r\nI also strongly commend to the favorable action of the Congress the\r\nenactment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the\r\nprinciples embodied in Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United\r\nStates, in the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883, and the Executive\r\nOrders of June 27, 1906, and of November 26, 1909. The excellent results\r\nwhich have attended the partial application of Civil Service principles to\r\nthe diplomatic and consular services are an earnest of the benefit to be\r\nwrought by a wider and more permanent extension of those principles to both\r\nbranches of the foreign service. The marked improvement in the consular\r\nservice during the four years since the principles of the Civil Service Act\r\nwere applied to that service in a limited way, and the good results already\r\nnoticeable from a similar application of civil service principles to the\r\ndiplomatic service a year ago, convince me that the enactment into law of\r\nthe general principles of the existing executive regulations could not fail\r\nto effect further improvement of both branches of the foreign service,\r\noffering as it would by its assurance of permanency of tenure and promotion\r\non merit, an inducement for the entry of capable young men into the service\r\nand an incentive to those already in to put forth their best efforts to\r\nattain and maintain that degree of efficiency which the interests of our\r\ninternational relations and commerce demand.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF OUR EMBASSY AND LEGATION PREMISES.\r\n\r\nDuring many years past appeals have been made from time to time to Congress\r\nin favor of Government ownership of embassy and legation premises abroad.\r\nThe arguments in favor of such ownership have been many and oft repeated\r\nand are well known to the Congress. The acquisition by the Government of\r\nsuitable residences and offices for its diplomatic officers, especially in\r\nthe capitals of the Latin-American States and of Europe, is so important\r\nand necessary to an improved diplomatic service that I have no hesitation\r\nin urging upon the Congress the passage of some measure similar to that\r\nfavorably reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on February\r\n14, 1910 (Report No. 438), that would authorize the gradual and annual\r\nacquisition of premises for diplomatic use.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Diplomatic Service is devoid of partisanship; its\r\nimportance should appeal to every American citizen and should receive the\r\ngenerous consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nESTIMATES FOR NEXT YEAR'S EXPENSES.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated\r\ncost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1912. I\r\nsay this in order that Congress may understand that these estimates thus\r\nmade present the smallest sum which will maintain the departments, bureaus,\r\nand offices of the Government and meet its other obligations under existing\r\nlaw, and that a cut of these estimates would result in embarrassing the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government in the performance of its duties. This\r\nremark does not apply to the river and harbor estimates, except to those\r\nfor expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under authorized\r\ncontracts, nor does it apply to the public building bill nor to the navy\r\nbuilding program. Of course, as to these Congress could withhold any part\r\nor all of the estimates for them without interfering with the discharge of\r\nthe ordinary obligations of the Government or the performance of the\r\nfunctions of its departments, bureaus, and offices.\r\n\r\nA FIFTY-TWO MILLION CUT.\r\n\r\nThe final estimates for the year ending June 30, 1912, as they have been\r\nsent to the Treasury, on November 29 of this year, for the ordinary\r\nexpenses of the Government, including those for public buildings, rivers\r\nand harbors, and the navy building program, amount to $630,494,013.12. This\r\nis $52,964,887.36 less than the appropriations for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1911. It is $16,883,153.44 less than the total estimates,\r\nincluding supplemental estimates submitted to Congress by the Treasury for\r\nthe year 1911, and is $5,574,659.39 less than the original estimates\r\nsubmitted by the Treasury for 1911.\r\n\r\nThese figures do not include the appropriations for the Panama Canal, the\r\npolicy in respect to which ought to be, and is, to spend as much each year\r\nas can be economically and effectively expended in order to complete the\r\nCanal as promptly as possible, and, therefore, the ordinary motive for\r\ncutting down the expense of the Government does not apply to appropriations\r\nfor this purpose. It will be noted that the estimates for the Panama Canal\r\nfor the ensuing year are more than fifty-six millions of dollars, an\r\nincrease of twenty millions over the amount appropriated for this year--a\r\ndifference due to the fact that the estimates for 1912 include something\r\nover nineteen millions for the fortification of the Canal. Against the\r\nestimated expenditures of $630,494,013.12, the Treasury has estimated\r\nreceipts for next year $680,000,000, making a probable surplus of ordinary\r\nreceipts over ordinary expenditures of about $50,000,000.\r\n\r\nA table showing in detail the estimates and the comparisons referred to\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nTYPICAL ECONOMIES.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Department is one of the original departments of the\r\nGovernment. With the changes in the monetary system made from time to time\r\nand with the creation of national banks, it was thought necessary to\r\norganize new bureaus and divisions which were added in a somewhat haphazard\r\nway and resulted in a duplication of duties which might well now be ended.\r\nThis lack of system and economic coordination has attracted the attention\r\nof the head of that Department who has been giving his time for the last\r\ntwo years, with the aid of experts and by consulting his bureau chiefs, to\r\nits reformation. He has abolished four hundred places in the civil service\r\nwithout at all injuring its efficiency. Merely to illustrate the character\r\nof the reforms that are possible, I shall comment on some of the specific\r\nchanges that are being made, or ought to be made by legislative aid.\r\n\r\nAUDITING SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe auditing system in vogue is as old as the Government and the methods\r\nused are antiquated. There are six Auditors and seven Assistant Auditors\r\nfor the nine departments, and under the present system the only function\r\nwhich the Auditor of a department exercises is to determine, on accounts\r\npresented by disbursing officers, that the object of the expenditure was\r\nwithin the law and the appropriation made by Congress for the purpose on\r\nits face, and that the calculations in the accounts are correct. He does\r\nnot examine the merits of the transaction or determine the reasonableness\r\nof the price paid for the articles purchased, nor does he furnish any\r\nsubstantial check upon disbursing officers and the heads of departments or\r\nbureaus with sufficient promptness to enable the Government to recoup\r\nitself in full measure for unlawful expenditure. A careful plan is being\r\ndevised and will be presented to Congress with the recommendation that the\r\nforce of auditors and employees under them be greatly reduced, thereby\r\neffecting substantial economy. But this economy will be small compared with\r\nthe larger economy that can be effected by consolidation and change of\r\nmethods. The possibilities in this regard have been shown in the reduction\r\nof expenses and the importance of methods and efficiency in the office of\r\nthe Auditor for the Post Office Department, who, without in the slightest\r\ndegree impairing the comprehensiveness and efficiency of his work, has cut\r\ndown the expenses of his office $120,000 a year.\r\n\r\nStatement of estimates of appropriations for the fiscal years 1912 and\r\n1911, and of appropriations for 1911, showing increases and decreases. -\r\nFinal Estimates for 1912 as of November 29 - Original Estimates submitted\r\nby the Treasury for 1911 - Total Estimates for 1911 including supplementals\r\n- Appropriations for 1911 - Increase (+) and decrease (-), 1912 estimates\r\nagainst 1911 total estimates - Increase (+) and decrease (-), 1912\r\nestimates against 1911 total appropriations - Increase (+) and decrease\r\n(-), 1911 estimates against 1911 total appropriations\r\n\r\nLegislature - $13,426,805.73 - $13,169,679.70 - $13,169,679.70 -\r\n$12,938,048.00 - + $257,126.03 - + $488,757.73 - + $231,631.70\r\n\r\nExecutive - 998,170.00 - 472,270.00 - 722,270.00 - 870,750.00 - +\r\n275,900.00 - + 127,420.00 - - 148,480.00\r\n\r\nState Department: - 4,875,576.41 - 4,875,301.41 - 4,749,801.41 -\r\n5,046,701.41 - + 125,775.00 - - 171,125.00 - - 296,900.00\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT: Treasury Department proper - 68,735,451.00 -\r\n69,865,240.00 - 70,393,543.75 - 69,973,434.61 - - 1,658,092.75 - -\r\n1,237,983.61 - + 420,109.14\r\n\r\nPublic buildings and works - 11,864,545.60 - 6,198,365.60 - 7,101,465.60 -\r\n5,565,164.00 - + 4,763,080.00 - + 6,299,381.60 - + 1,536,301.60\r\n\r\nTerritorial governments - 202,150.00 - 287,350.00 - 292,350.00 - 282,600.00\r\n- - 90,200.00 - - 80,450.00 - + 9,750.00\r\n\r\nIndependent offices - 2,638,695.12 - 2,400,695.12 - 2,492,695.12 -\r\n2,128,695.12 - + 146,000.00 - + 510,000.00 - + 364,000.00\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia - 13,602,785.90 - 11,884,928.49 - 12,108,878.49 -\r\n11,440,346.99 - + 1,492,907.41 - + 2,162,439.91 - + 668,532.50\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT: War Department proper - 120,104,260.12 - 124,165,656.28 -\r\n125,717,204.77 - 122,322,178.12 - - 5,612,944.65 - - 2,217,918.00 - +\r\n3,395,026.65\r\n\r\nRivers and harbors - 28,232,438.00 - 28,232,465.00 - 28,232,465.00 -\r\n49,390,541.50 - - 27.00 - -21,158,103.50 - -21,158,076.50\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT: Navy Department proper - 116,101,730.24 - 117,029,914.38 -\r\n119,768,860.83 - 119,596,870.46 - - 3,667,130.59 - - 3,495,140.22 - +\r\n171,990.37\r\n\r\nNew navy building program - 12,840,428.00 - 12,844,122.00 - 12,844,122.00 -\r\n14,790,122.00 - - 3,694.00 - - 1,949,694.00 - - 1,946,000.00\r\n\r\nInterior Department - 189,151,875.00 - 191,224,182.90 - 193,948,582.02 -\r\n214,754,278.00 - - 4,796,707.02 - -25,602,403.00 - -20,805,698.98\r\n\r\nPost-Office Department proper - 1,697,490.00 - 1,695,690.00 - 1,695,690.00\r\n- 2,085,005.33 - + 1,800.00 - - 387,515.33 - - 389,315.33\r\n\r\nDeficiency in postal revenues - --------------- - 10,634,122.63 -\r\n10,634,122.63 - 10,634,122.63 - -10,634,122.65 - -10,634,122.63 -\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDepartment of Agriculture - 19,681,066.00 - 17,681,136.00 - 17,753,931.24 -\r\n17,821,836.00 - + 1,927,134.76 - + 1,859,230.00 - - 67,904.76\r\n\r\nDepartment of Commerce and\r\n\r\nLabor - 16,276,970.00 - 14,187,913.00 - 15,789,271.00 - 14,169,969.32 - +\r\n487,699.00 - + 2,107,000.68 - + 1,619,301.68\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice - 10,063,576.00 - 9,518,640.00 - 9,962,233.00 -\r\n9,648,237.99 - + 101,343.00 - + 415,338.01 - + 313,995.01 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam H. Taft\r\nDecember 5, 1911\r\n\r\nJump to Part II | Part III | Part IV\r\n\r\nThis message is the first of several which I shall send to Congress during\r\nthe interval between the opening of its regular session and its adjournment\r\nfor the Christmas holidays. The amount of information to be communicated as\r\nto the operations of the Government, the number of important subjects\r\ncalling for comment by the Executive, and the transmission to Congress of\r\nexhaustive reports of special commissions, make it impossible to include in\r\none message of a reasonable length a discussion of the topics that ought to\r\nbe brought to the attention of the National Legislature at its first\r\nregular session.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-TRUST LAW-THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS.\r\n\r\nIn May last the Supreme Court handed down decisions in the suits in equity\r\nbrought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the\r\nStandard Oil Trust and of the American Tobacco Trust, and to secure their\r\ndissolution. The decisions are epoch-making and serve to advise the\r\nbusiness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust\r\nact of 1890. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the\r\nprevious decisions of the court in construing and applying this important\r\nstatute, but they clarify those decisions by further defining the already\r\nadmitted exceptions to the literal construction of the act. By the decrees,\r\nthey furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the\r\ncapital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need\r\nand wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for\r\nthe entire business community to square with the rule of action and\r\nlegality thus finally established and to preserve the benefit, freedom, and\r\nspur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nNO CHANGE IN THE RULE OF DECISION-MERELY IN ITS FORM OF EXPRESSION.\r\n\r\nThe statute in its first section declares to be illegal \"every contract,\r\ncombination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint\r\nof trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations,\" and\r\nin the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor \"every person who shall\r\nmonopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other\r\nperson to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several\r\nStates or with foreign nations.\"\r\n\r\nIn two early cases, where the statute was invoked to enjoin a\r\ntransportation rate agreement between interstate railroad companies, it was\r\nheld that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates\r\ncomplained of was reasonable at common law, because it was said that the\r\nstatute was directed against all contracts and combinations in restraint of\r\ntrade whether reasonable at common law or not. It was plain from the\r\nrecord, however, that the contracts complained of in those cases would not\r\nhave been deemed reasonable at common law. In subsequent cases the court\r\nsaid that the statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused\r\nto include within its inhibition, certain contractual restraints of trade\r\nwhich it denominated as incidental or as indirect.\r\n\r\nThese cases of restraint of trade that the court excepted from the\r\noperation of the statute were instances which, at common law, would have\r\nbeen called reasonable. In the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, therefore,\r\nthe court merely adopted the tests of the common law, and in defining\r\nexceptions to the literal application of the statute, only substituted for\r\nthe test of being incidental or indirect, that of being reasonable, and\r\nthis, without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the\r\nstatute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now\r\nbeen decided would have been decided the same way if the court had\r\noriginally accepted in its construction the rule at common law.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the court, by introducing into the construction of\r\nthe statute common-law distinctions, has emasculated it. This is obviously\r\nuntrue. By its judgment every contract and combination in restraint of\r\ninterstate trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling\r\nprices by stifling competition, or of establishing in whole or in part a\r\nmonopoly of such trade, is condemned by the statute. The most extreme\r\ncritics can not instance a case that ought to be condemned under the\r\nstatute which is not brought within its terms as thus construed.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is also made that the Supreme Court by its decision in the\r\nlast two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited\r\ndiscretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade is within the\r\nterms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of\r\ntrade at common law is well understood and is clearly defined. It does not\r\nrest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the\r\npurpose of a lawful main contract to which, in order that it shall be\r\nenforceable at all, it must be incidental. If it exceed the needs of that\r\ncontract, it is void.\r\n\r\nThe test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at common law to\r\ncontracts or combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade whose\r\npurpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to\r\ncontrol prices, or establish monopolies. The courts never assumed power to\r\nsay that such contracts or combinations or conspiracies might be lawful if\r\nthe parties to them were only moderate in the use of the power thus secured\r\nand did not exact from the public too great and exorbitant prices. It is\r\ntrue that many theorists, and others engaged in business violating the\r\nstatute, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts; but no\r\ncourt of authority has ever attempted it. Certainly there is nothing in the\r\ndecisions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of\r\njudicial discretion in enforcing this statute can derive the slightest\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nFORCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATUTE A MATTER OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nWe have been twenty-one years making this statute effective for the\r\npurposes for which it was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and\r\nseemed to remit to the States the whole available power to attack and\r\nsuppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the error of that\r\njudgment was corrected, and only in the last three or four years has the\r\nheavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations that\r\nhave exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our industries.\r\nCriminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, but\r\njuries have felt averse to convicting for jail sentences, and judges have\r\nbeen most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectable standing\r\nin society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as\r\nthe offense becomes better understood and the committing of it partakes\r\nmore of studied and deliberate defiance of the law, we can be confident\r\nthat juries will convict individuals and that jail sentences will be\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY IN EQUITY BY DISSOLUTION.\r\n\r\nIn the Standard Oil case the Supreme and Circuit Courts found the\r\ncombination to be a monopoly of the interstate business of refining,\r\ntransporting, and marketing petroleum and its products, effected and\r\nmaintained through thirty-seven different corporations, the stock of which\r\nwas held by a New Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of\r\nthis combination, directed the transfer and pro rata distribution by the\r\nNew Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-seven corporations\r\nto and among its stockholders; and the corporations and individual\r\ndefendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such\r\nmonopoly; and all agreements between the subsidiary corporations tending to\r\nproduce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined.\r\n\r\nIn the Tobacco case, the court found that the individual defendants,\r\ntwenty-nine in number, had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire\r\ncomplete dominion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco\r\nin this country and abroad, and that this had been done by combinations\r\nmade with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices, and\r\nestablish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but also of\r\ntin-foil and licorice used in its manufacture and of its products of\r\ncigars, cigarettes, and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more\r\ncomplicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree\r\nwhich would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the\r\nstatute. There was here no single holding company as in the case of the\r\nStandard Oil Trust. The main company was the American Tobacco Company, a\r\nmanufacturing, selling, and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy\r\nthe combination and restore competition involved the redivision of the\r\ncapital and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies\r\nconstituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the\r\ndecree and made parties to it, and numbering, new and old, fourteen.\r\n\r\nSITUATION AFTER READJUSTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe American Tobacco Company (old), readjusted capital, $92, 000,000; the\r\nLiggett & Meyers Tobacco Company (new), capital, $67,000,000; the P.\r\nLorillard Company (new), capital, $47,000,000; and the R. J. Reynolds\r\nTobacco Company (old), capital, $7,525,000, are chiefly engaged in the\r\nmanufacture and sale of chewing and smoking tobacco and cigars. The former\r\none tinfoil company is divided into two, one of $825,000 capital and the\r\nother of $400,000. The one snuff company is divided into three companies,\r\none with a capital Of $15,000,000, another with a capital of $8,000,000,\r\nand a third with a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two\r\none with a capital Of $5,758,300 and another with a capital of $200,000.\r\nThere is, also, the British-American Tobacco Company, a British\r\ncorporation, doing business abroad with a capital Of $26,000,000, the Porto\r\nRican Tobacco Company, with a capital of $1,800,000, and the corporation of\r\nUnited Cigar Stores, with a capital of $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nUnder this arrangement, each of the different kinds of business will be\r\ndistributed between two or more companies with a division of the prominent\r\nbrands in the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only\r\npossible but necessary. Thus the smoking-tobacco business of the country is\r\ndivided so that the present independent companies have 21-39 per cent,\r\nwhile the American Tobacco Company will have 33-08 per cent, the Liggett &\r\nMeyers 20.05 per cent, the Lorillard Company 22.82 per cent, and the\r\nReynolds Company 2.66 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies,\r\nboth preferred and common, has been taken from the defendant American\r\nTobacco Company and has been distributed among its stockholders. All\r\ncovenants restricting competition have been declared null and further\r\nperformance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different\r\ncompanies has now been given voting power which was denied it under the old\r\norganization. The ratio of the preferred stock to the common was as 78 to\r\n40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character of the\r\nownership and control of each company.\r\n\r\nIn the original suit there were twenty-nine defendants who were charged\r\nwith being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired\r\nand exercised its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants.\r\nwill hold amounts of stock in the various distributee companies ranging\r\nfrom 41 per cent as a maximum to 28.5 per cent as a minimum, except in the\r\ncase of one small company, the Porto Rican Tobacco Company, in which they\r\nwill hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine individual defendants are enjoined\r\nfor three years from buying any stock except from each other, and the group\r\nis thus prevented from extending its control during that period. All\r\nparties to the suit, and the new companies who are made parties are\r\nenjoined perpetually from in any way effecting any combination between any\r\nof the companies in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the\r\nold trust. Each of the fourteen companies is enjoined from acquiring stock\r\nin any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common\r\ndirectors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common\r\noffices, or lending money to each other.\r\n\r\nSIZE OF NEW COMPANIES.\r\n\r\nObjection was made by certain independent tobacco companies that this\r\nsettlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in\r\nactive business, and that the settlement that would be effective to put all\r\non an equality would be a division of the capital and plant of the trust\r\ninto small fractions in amount more nearly equal to that of each of the\r\nindependent companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of\r\nthe anti-trust law and its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent\r\nthe accumulation of large capital in business enterprises in which such a\r\ncombination can secure reduced cost of production, sale, and distribution.\r\nIt is directed against such an aggregation of capital only when its purpose\r\nis that of stifling competition, enhancing or controlling prices, and\r\nestablishing a monopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these\r\npurposes and restored competition between the large units into which the\r\ncapital and plant have been divided, we shall have accomplished the useful\r\npurpose of the statute.\r\n\r\nCONFISCATION NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital\r\nof the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or imprisonment of\r\nthe individual offenders, by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of\r\nits goods in transportation, are provided, but the proceeding in equity is\r\na specific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and\r\nprevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nEFFECTIVENESS OF DECREE.\r\n\r\nI venture to say that not in the history of American law has a decree more\r\neffective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the\r\nTobacco Trust. As Circuit judge Noyes said in his judgment approving the\r\ndecree:\r\n\r\n\"The extent to which it has been necessary to tear apart this combination\r\nand force it into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demonstrate\r\nthat the Federal anti-trust statute is a drastic statute which accomplishes\r\neffective results; which so long as it stands on the statute books must be\r\nobeyed, and which can not be disobeyed without incurring far-reaching\r\npenalties. And, on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this\r\norganization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not\r\nto destroy, but to reconstruct; not to demolish, but to re-create in\r\naccordance with the conditions which the Congress has declared shall exist\r\namong the people of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nCOMMON STOCK OWNERSHIP.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that the present pro rata and common ownership in all\r\nthese companies by former stockholders of the trust would insure a\r\ncontinuance of the same old single control of all the companies into which\r\nthe trust has by decree been disintegrated. This is erroneous and is based\r\nupon the assumed inefficacy and innocuousness of judicial injunctions. The\r\ncompanies are enjoined from cooperation or combination; they have different\r\nmanagers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or many of the\r\nnumerous stockholders, reaching into the thousands, attempt to secure\r\nconcerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market,\r\ntheir number is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed,\r\nand its prime movers and all its participants would be at once subject to\r\ncontempt proceedings and imprisonment of a summary character. The immediate\r\nresult of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the\r\ncompanies under different managers, and then competition must follow, or\r\nthere will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Only a\r\nshort time will inevitably lead to a change in ownership of the stock, as\r\nall opportunity for continued cooperation must disappear. Those critics who\r\nspeak of this disintegration in the trust as a mere change of garments have\r\nnot given consideration to the inevitable working of the decree and\r\nunderstand little the personal danger of attempting to evade or set at\r\nnaught the solemn injunction of a court whose object is made plain by the\r\ndecree and whose inhibitions are set forth with a detail and\r\ncomprehensiveness.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY REORGANIZATIONS OF OTHER TRUSTS AT HAND.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the\r\ncombination of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern wholesale\r\ngrocers' association, an interlocutory decree against the Powder Trust with\r\ndirections by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other\r\ncombinations of a similar history are now negotiating with the Department\r\nof justice looking to a disintegration by decree and reorganization in\r\naccordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations\r\nwithout general business disturbance.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT FOR REPEAL OF THE ANTI-TRUST LAW.\r\n\r\nBut now that the anti-trust act is seen to be effective for the\r\naccomplishment of the purpose of its enactment, we are met by a cry from\r\nmany different quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of\r\nbusiness progress to be an attempt to restore old-fashioned methods of\r\ndestructive competition between small units, and to make impossible those\r\nuseful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production\r\nthat are essential to continued prosperity and normal growth.\r\n\r\nIn the recent decisions the Supreme Court makes clear that there is nothing\r\nin the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mere bigness of\r\nplant organized to secure economy in production and a reduction of its\r\ncost. It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization\r\nand maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of immense size are\r\nthe stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of\r\nprices and establishing a monopoly, that the statute is violated. Mere size\r\nis no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants\r\nnecessarily eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but\r\nthis elimination is in contravention of the statute only when the\r\ncombination is made for purpose of ending this particular competition in\r\norder to secure control of, and enhance, prices and create a monopoly.\r\n\r\nLACK OF DEFINITENESS IN THE STATUTE.\r\n\r\nThe complaint is made of the statute that it is not sufficiently definite\r\nin its description of that which is forbidden, to enable business men to\r\navoid its violation. The suggestion is, that we may have a combination of\r\ntwo corporations, which may run on for years, and that subsequently the\r\nAttorney General may conclude that it was a violation of the statute, and\r\nthat which was supposed by the combiners to be innocent then turns out to\r\nbe a combination in violation of the statute. The answer to this\r\nhypothetical case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital\r\nas will enable them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a\r\nmonopoly, they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing\r\nwithout having it clearly in mind. If what they do is merely for the\r\npurpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of\r\nsuppressing competition by use of the bigness of the plant they are\r\ncreating, then they can not be convicted at the time the union is made, nor\r\ncan they be convicted later, unless it happen that later on they conclude\r\nto suppress competition and take the usual methods for doing so, and thus\r\nestablish for themselves a monopoly. They can, in such a case, hardly\r\ncomplain if the motive which subsequently is disclosed is attributed by the\r\ncourt to the original combination.\r\n\r\nNEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED.\r\n\r\nMuch is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation\r\nintended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest\r\nmerchants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be\r\nevolved, but I submit that the discussions which have been brought out in\r\nrecent days by the fear of the continued execution of the anti-trust law\r\nhave produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line\r\nof distinction or rule of action as definite and as clear as that which the\r\nSupreme Court itself lays down in enforcing the statute.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION NEEDED--NOT REPEAL OR AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\nI see no objection-and indeed I can see decided advantages-in the enactment\r\nof a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are\r\nunfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced in the anti-trust\r\nlaw. The attempt and purpose to suppress a competitor by underselling him\r\nat a price so unprofitable as to drive him out of business, or the making\r\nof exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give\r\nup association with other manufacturers, and numerous kindred methods for\r\nstifling competition and effecting monopoly, should be described with\r\nsufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the\r\nGovernment to shorten its task by prosecuting single misdemeanors instead\r\nof an entire conspiracy, and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of\r\npointing out more in detail to the business community what must be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL INCORPORATION RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\nIn a special message to Congress on January 7, 1910, I ventured to point\r\nout the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution\r\nof these offending trusts. I said:\r\n\r\n\"But such an investigation and possible prosecution of corporations whose\r\nprosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders but\r\nof millions of wage earners, employees, and associated tradesmen must\r\nnecessarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to\r\ndry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of hoarding, and\r\nproduce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and\r\nstrained circumstances among the innocent many for the faults of the guilty\r\nfew. The question which I wish in this message to bring clearly to the\r\nconsideration and discussion of Congress is whether, in order to avoid such\r\na possible business danger, something can not be done by which these\r\nbusiness combinations may be offered a means, without great financial\r\ndisturbance, of changing the character, organization, and extent of their\r\nbusiness into one within the lines of the law under Federal control and\r\nsupervision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute.\r\n\r\n\"Generally, in the industrial combinations called 'trusts,' the principal\r\nbusiness is the sale of goods in many States and in foreign markets; in\r\nother words, the interstate and foreign business far exceeds the business\r\ndone in any one State. This fact will justify the Federal Government in\r\ngranting a Federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in\r\ninterstate and foreign commerce the products of useful manufacture under\r\nsuch limitations as will secure a compliance with the anti-trust law. It is\r\npossible so to frame a statute that while it offers protection to a Federal\r\ncompany against harmful, vexatious, and unnecessary invasion by the States,\r\nit shall subject it to reasonable taxation and control by the States with\r\nrespect to its purely local business. * * *\r\n\r\n\"Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquiring\r\nand holding stock in other corporations (except for special reasons, upon\r\napproval by the proper Federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under\r\nnational auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations in\r\ndifferent States, which has been such an effective agency in the creation\r\nof the great trusts and monopolies.\r\n\r\n\"If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint\r\nof trade is to be effectively enforced, it is essential that the National\r\nGovernment shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry\r\non a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws\r\nof the different States of the Union with respect to foreign corporations\r\nmake it difficult, if not impossible, for one corporation to comply with\r\ntheir requirements so as to carry on business in a number of different\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for\r\nthe voluntary formation of corporations to engage in trade and commerce\r\namong the States and with foreign nations. Every argument which was then\r\nadvanced for such a law, and every explanation which was at that time\r\noffered to possible objections, have been confirmed by our experience since\r\nthe enforcement of the antitrust, statute has resulted in the actual\r\ndissolution of active commercial organizations.\r\n\r\nIt is even more manifest now than it was then that the denunciation of\r\nconspiracies in restraint of trade should not and does not mean the denial\r\nof organizations large enough to be intrusted with our interstate and\r\nforeign trade. It has been made more clear now than it was then that a\r\npurely negative statute like the anti-trust law may well be supplemented by\r\nspecific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate\r\nnational and foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERTS NEEDED TO AID COURTS IN TRUST\r\nDISSOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with\r\na view to their reorganization into legitimate corporations, has made it\r\nespecially apparent that the courts are not provided with the\r\nadministrative machinery to make the necessary inquiries preparatory to\r\nreorganization, or to pursue such inquiries, and they should be empowered\r\nto invoke the aid of the Bureau of Corporations in determining the suitable\r\nreorganization of the disintegrated parts. The circuit court and the\r\nAttorney General were greatly aided in framing the decree in the Tobacco\r\nTrust dissolution by an expert from the Bureau of Corporations.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL CORPORATION COMMISSION PROPOSED.\r\n\r\nI do not set forth in detail the terms and sections of a statute which\r\nmight supply the constructive legislation permitting and aiding the\r\nformation of combinations of capital into Federal corporations. They should\r\nbe subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including\r\neffective publicity, and to the closest supervision as to the issue of\r\nstock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission in the Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their\r\nproposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that\r\nincorporation under Federal law could not exempt the company thus formed\r\nand its incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust\r\nlaw for subsequent illegal conduct, but the publicity of its procedure and\r\nthe opportunity for frequent consultation with the bureau or commission in\r\ncharge of the incorporation as to the legitimate purpose of its\r\ntransactions would offer it as great security against successful\r\nprosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise.\r\n\r\nSuch a bureau or commission might well be invested also with the duty\r\nalready referred to, of aiding courts in the dissolution and recreation of\r\ntrusts within the law. It should be an executive tribunal of the dignity\r\nand power of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, which now exercise supervisory power over important classes of\r\ncorporations under Federal regulation.\r\n\r\nThe drafting of such a Federal incorporation law would offer ample\r\nopportunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management to-day,\r\nincluding irresponsibility of control in the hands of the few who are not\r\nthe real owners.\r\n\r\nINCORPORATION VOLUNTARY.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Federal charters thus to be granted shall be\r\nvoluntary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The\r\nbenefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the\r\nprotection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep\r\nwithin the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fail to take\r\nadvantage of the Federal incorporation will not have a right to complain if\r\ntheir failure is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to\r\nthe careful official scrutiny, competent supervision, and publicity\r\nattendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter.\r\n\r\nONLY SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION NEEDED.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity thus suggested for Federal incorporation, it seems tome, is\r\nsuitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring Of\r\ngreat industrial enterprises to the rule of action laid down by the\r\nanti-trust law. This statute as construed by the Supreme Court must\r\ncontinue to be the line of distinction for legitimate business. It must be\r\nenforced, unless we are to banish individualism from all business and\r\nreduce it to one common system of regulation or control of prices like that\r\nwhich now prevails with respect to public utilities, and which when applied\r\nto all business would be a long step toward State socialism.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE ANTI-TRUST ACT.\r\n\r\nThe anti-trust act is the expression of the effort of a freedom-loving\r\npeople to preserve equality of opportunity. It is the result of the\r\nconfident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by\r\npreserving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of the individual,\r\nhis industry, his ingenuity, his intelligence, and his independent\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years or more this statute has been upon the statute book. All\r\nknew its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators were cynical\r\nover its assumed impotence. It seemed impossible of enforcement. Slowly the\r\nmills of the courts ground, and only gradually did the majesty of the law\r\nassert itself. Many of its statesmen-authors died before it became a living\r\nforce, and they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to\r\ndestroy. Now its efficacy is seen; now its power is heavy; now its object\r\nis near achievement. Now we hear the call for its repeal on the plea that\r\nit interferes with business prosperity, and we are advised in most general\r\nterms, how by some other statute and in some other way the evil we are just\r\nstamping out can be cured, if we only abandon this work of twenty years and\r\ntry another experiment for another term of years.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the act has not done good. Can this be said in the face of\r\nthe effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way so\r\ndrastic or inhibitive in detail as either the Standard Oil decree or the\r\nTobacco decree; but did it not stop for all time the then powerful movement\r\ntoward the control of all the railroads of the country in a single hand?\r\nSuch a one-man power could not have been a healthful influence in the\r\nRepublic, even though exercised under the general supervision of an\r\ninterstate commission.\r\n\r\nDo we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful? When\r\nall energies are directed, not toward the reduction of the cost of\r\nproduction for the public benefit by a healthful competition, but toward\r\nnew ways and means for making permanent in a few hands the absolute control\r\nof the conditions and prices prevailing in the whole field of industry,\r\nthen individual enterprise and effort will be paralyzed and the spirit of\r\ncommercial freedom will be dead.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with other countries have continued\r\nduring the past twelve months upon a basis of the usual good will and\r\nfriendly intercourse. ARBITRATION.\r\n\r\nThe year just passed marks an important general movement on the part of the\r\nPowers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits\r\nto mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of\r\ninternational disputes by arbitration rather than by war, and in response\r\nto a widespread demand for an advance in that direction on the part of the\r\npeople of the United States and of Great Britain and of France, new\r\narbitration treaties were negotiated last spring with Great Britain and\r\nFrance, the terms of which were de signed, as expressed in the preamble of\r\nthese treaties, to extend the scope and obligations of the policy of\r\narbitration adopted in our present treaties with those Governments To pave\r\nthe way for this treat with the United States, Great Britain negotiated an\r\nimportant modification in its alliance with Japan, and the French\r\nGovernment also expedited the negotiations with signal good will. The new\r\ntreaties have been submitted to the Senate and are awaiting its advice and\r\nconsent to their ratification. All the essentials of these important\r\ntreaties have long been known, and it is my earnest hope that they will\r\nreceive prompt and favorable action.\r\n\r\nCLAIM OF ALSOP & CO. SETTLED.\r\n\r\nI am glad to report that on July 5 last the American claim of Alsop & Co.\r\nagainst the Government of Chile was finally disposed of by the decision of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty George V, to whom, as amiable compositeur, the matter\r\nhad been referred for determination. His Majesty made an award of nearly\r\n$1,000,000 to the claimants, which was promptly paid by Chile. The\r\nsettlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations\r\nbetween the Republic of Chile and the United States the only question which\r\nfor two decades had given the two foreign offices any serious concern and\r\nmakes possible the unobstructed development of the relations of friendship\r\nwhich it has been the aim of this Government in every possible way to\r\nfurther and cultivate.\r\n\r\nARBITRATIONS--PANAMA AND COSTA RICA--COLOMBIA AND HAITI.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the\r\nprinciple of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation, I\r\nam happy to advert to the part of the United States in facilitating\r\namicable settlement of disputes which menaced the peace between Panama and\r\nCosta Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nSince the date of their independence, Colombia and Costa Rica had been\r\nseeking a solution of a boundary dispute, which came as an heritage from\r\nColombia to the new Republic of Panama, upon its beginning life as an\r\nindependent nation. Although the disputants had submitted this question for\r\ndecision to the President of France under the terms of an arbitration\r\ntreaty, the exact interpretation of the provisions of the award rendered\r\nhad been a matter of serious disagreement between the two countries, both\r\ncontending for widely different lines even under the terms of the decision.\r\nSubsequently and since 1903 this boundary question had been the subject of\r\nfruitless diplomatic negotiations between the parties. In January, 1910, at\r\nthe request of both Governments the agents representing them met in\r\nconference at the Department of State and subsequently concluded a protocol\r\nsubmitting this long-pending controversy to the arbitral judgment of the\r\nChief justice of the United States, who consented to act in this capacity.\r\nA boundary commission, according to the international agreement, has now\r\nbeen appointed, and it is expected that the arguments will shortly proceed\r\nand that this long-standing dispute will be honorably and satisfactorily\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nAgain, a few months ago it appeared that the Dominican Republic and Haiti\r\nwere about to enter upon hostilities because of complications growing out\r\nof an acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had\r\nfailed to solve. The Government of the United States, by a friendly\r\ninterposition of good offices, succeeded in prevailing upon the parties to\r\nplace their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Accordingly, on\r\nthe friendly suggestion of this Government, the two Governments empowered\r\ncommissioners to meet at Washington in conference at the State Department\r\nin order to arrange the terms of submission to arbitration of the boundary\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nCHAMIZAL ARBITRATION NOT SATISFACTORY.\r\n\r\nOur arbitration of the Chamizal boundary question with Mexico was\r\nunfortunately abortive, but with the earnest efforts on the part of both\r\nGovernments which its importance commands, it is felt that an early\r\npractical adjustment should prove possible.\r\n\r\nLATIN AMERICA. VENEZUELA.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Republic of Venezuela celebrated the one hundredth\r\nanniversary of its independence. The United States sent, in honor of this\r\nevent, a special embassy to Caracas, where the cordial reception and\r\ngenerous hospitality shown it were most gratifying as a further proof of\r\nthe good relations and friendship existing between that country and the\r\nUnited States. MEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe recent political events in Mexico received attention from this\r\nGovernment because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation\r\ncreated along our southern border and the necessity for taking measures\r\nproperly to safeguard American interests. The Government of the United\r\nStates, in its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the\r\nso-called neutrality statutes of the Federal Government, issued directions\r\nto the appropriate officers to exercise a diligent and vigilant regard for\r\nthe requirements of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual\r\narmed conflict existed, there was no official recognition of belligerency\r\ninvolving the technical neutrality obligations of international law.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March last, in the absence of the Secretary of State, I had a\r\npersonal interview with Mr. Wilson, the ambassador of the United States to\r\nMexico, in which he reported to me that the conditions in Mexico were much\r\nmore critical than the press dispatches disclosed; that President Diaz was\r\non a volcano of popular uprising; that the small outbreaks which had\r\noccurred were only symptomatic of the whole condition; that a very large\r\nper cent of the people were in sympathy with the insurrection; that a\r\ngeneral explosion was probable at any time, in which case he feared that\r\nthe 40,000 or more American residents in Mexico might be assailed, and that\r\nthe very large American investments might be injured or destroyed.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference with the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nI thought it wise to assemble an Army division of full strength at San\r\nAntonio, Tex., a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of\r\nInfantry in the Los Angeles district of southern California, together with\r\na squadron of battleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a\r\nsmall squadron of ships at San Diego. At the same time, through our\r\nrepresentative at the City of Mexico, I expressed to President Diaz the\r\nhope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures as to\r\nthese military maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance\r\nwhich should cause concern to his Government.\r\n\r\nThe mobilization was effected with great promptness, and on the 15th of\r\nMarch, through the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, in a\r\nletter addressed to the Chief of Staff, I issued the following\r\ninstructions: It seems my duty as Commander in Chief to place troops in\r\nsufficient number where, if Congress shall direct that they enter Mexico to\r\nsave American lives and property, an effective movement may be promptly\r\nmade. Meantime, the movement of the troops to Texas and elsewhere near the\r\nboundary, accompanied with sincere assurances of the utmost goodwill toward\r\nthe present Mexican Government and with larger and more frequent patrols\r\nalong the border to prevent insurrectionary expeditions from American soil,\r\nwill hold up the hands of the existing Government and will have a healthy\r\nmoral effect to prevent attacks upon Americans and their property in any\r\nsubsequent general internecine strife. Again, the sudden mobilization of a\r\ndivision of troops has been a great test of our Army and full of useful\r\ninstruction, while the maneuvers that are thus made possible can occupy the\r\ntroops and their officers to great advantage.\r\n\r\nThe assumption by the press that I contemplate intervention on Mexican soil\r\nto protect American lives or property is of course gratuitous, because I\r\nseriously doubt whether I have such authority under any circumstances, and\r\nif I had I would not exercise it without express congressional approval.\r\nIndeed, as you know, I have already declined, without Mexican consent, to\r\norder a troop of Cavalry to protect the breakwater we are constructing just\r\nacross the border in Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado River to save the\r\nImperial Valley, although the insurrectos had scattered the Mexican troops\r\nand were taking our horses and supplies and frightening our workmen away.\r\nMy determined purpose, however, is to be in a position so that when danger\r\nto American lives and property in Mexico threatens and the existing\r\nGovernment is rendered helpless by the insurrection, I can promptly execute\r\ncongressional orders to protect them, with effect.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I send you this letter, through the Secretary, to call your\r\nattention to some things in connection with the presence of the division in\r\nthe Southwest which have doubtless occurred to you, but which I wish to\r\nemphasize.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I want to make the mobilization a first-class training\r\nfor the Army, and I wish you would give your time and that of the War\r\nCollege to advising and carrying out maneuvers of a useful character, and\r\nplan to continue to do this during the next three months. By that time we\r\nmay expect that either Ambassador Wilson's fears will have been realized\r\nand chaos and its consequences have ensued, or that the present Government\r\nof Mexico will have so readjusted matters as to secure tranquillity-a\r\nresult devoutly to be wished. The troops can then be returned to their\r\nposts. I understood from you in Washington that Gen. Aleshire said that you\r\ncould probably meet all the additional expense of this whole movement out\r\nof the present appropriations if the troops continue in Texas for three\r\nmonths. I sincerely hope this is so. I observe from the newspapers that you\r\nhave no blank cartridges, but I presume that this is an error, or that it\r\nwill be easy to procure those for use as soon as your maneuvers begin.\r\n\r\nSecond. Texas is a State ordinarily peaceful, but you can not put 20,000\r\ntroops into it without running some risk of a collision between the people\r\nof that State, and especially the Mexicans who live in Texas near the\r\nborder and who sympathize with the insurrectos, and the Federal soldiers.\r\nFor that reason I beg you to be as careful as you can to prevent friction\r\nof any kind. We were able in Cuba, with the army of pacification there of\r\nsomething more than 5,000 troops, to maintain them for a year without any\r\ntrouble, and I hope you can do the same thing in Texas. Please give your\r\nattention to this, and advise all the officers in command of the necessity\r\nfor very great circumspection in this regard.\r\n\r\nThird. One of the great troubles in the concentration of troops is the\r\ndanger of disease, and I suppose that you have adopted the most modern\r\nmethods for preventing and, if necessary, for stamping out epidemics. That\r\nis so much a part of a campaign that it hardly seems necessary for me to\r\ncall attention to it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish you to examine the question of the patrol of the border and\r\nput as many troops on that work as is practicable, and more than are now\r\nengaged in it, in order to prevent the use of our borderland for the\r\ncarrying out of the insurrection. I have given assurances to the Mexican\r\nambassador on this point.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that this experience will always be remembered by the Army\r\nand Navy as a useful means of education, and I should be greatly\r\ndisappointed if it resulted in any injury or disaster to our forces from\r\nany cause. I have taken a good deal of responsibility in ordering this\r\nmobilization, but I am ready to answer for it if only you and those under\r\nyou use the utmost care to avoid the difficulties which I have pointed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nYou may have a copy of this letter made and left with Gen. Carter and such\r\nother generals in command as you may think wise and necessary to guide them\r\nin their course, but to be regarded as confidential. I am more than happy\r\nto here record the fact that all apprehensions as to the effect of the\r\npresence of so large a military force in Texas proved groundless; no\r\ndisturbances occurred; the conduct of the troops was exemplary and the\r\npublic reception and treatment of them was all that could have been\r\ndesired, and this notwithstanding the presence of a large number of Mexican\r\nrefugees in the border territory.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time communications were received from Ambassador Wilson, who\r\nhad returned to Mexico, confirming the view that the massing of American\r\ntroops in the neighborhood had had good effect. By dispatch of April 3,\r\n1911, the ambassador said: The continuing gravity of the situation here and\r\nthe chaos that would ensue should the constitutional authorities be\r\neventually overthrown, thus greatly increasing the danger to which American\r\nlives and property are already subject, confirm the wisdom of the President\r\nin taking those military precautions which, making every allowance for the\r\ndignity and the sovereignty of a friendly state, are due to our nationals\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nCharged as I am with the responsibility of safeguarding these lives and\r\nproperty, I am bound to say to the department that our military\r\ndispositions on the frontier have produced an effective impression on the\r\nMexican mind and may, at any moment, prove to be the only guaranties for\r\nthe safety of our nationals and their property. If it should eventuate that\r\nconditions here require more active measures by the President and Congress,\r\nsporadic attacks might be made upon the lives and property of our\r\nnationals, but the ultimate result would be order and adequate protection.\r\nThe insurrection continued and resulted In engagements between the regular\r\nMexican troops and the insurgents, and this along the border, so that in\r\nseveral instances bullets from the contending forces struck American\r\ncitizens engaged in their lawful occupations on American soil.\r\n\r\nProper protests were made against these invasions of American rights to the\r\nMexican authorities. On April 17, 1911, I received the following telegram\r\nfrom the governor of Arizona: As a result of to-day's fighting across the\r\ninternational line, but within gunshot range of the heart of Douglas, five\r\nAmericans wounded on this side of the line. Everything points to repetition\r\nof these casualties on to-morrow, and while the Federals seem disposed to\r\nkeep their agreement not to fire into Douglas, the position of the\r\ninsurrectionists is such that when fighting occurs on the east and\r\nsoutheast of the intrenchments people living in Douglas are put in danger\r\nof their lives. In my judgment radical measures are needed to protect our\r\ninnocent people, and if anything can be done to stop the fighting at Agua\r\nPrieta the situation calls for such action. It is impossible to safeguard\r\nthe people of Douglas unless the town be vacated. Can anything be done to\r\nrelieve situation, now acute? After a conference with the Secretary of\r\nState, the following telegram was sent to Governor Sloan, on April IS, 1911\r\n9 11, and made public: Your dispatch received. Have made urgent demand upon\r\nMexican Government to issue instructions to prevent firing across border by\r\nMexican federal troops, and am waiting reply. Meantime I have sent direct\r\nwarning to the Mexican and insurgent forces near Douglas. I infer from your\r\ndispatch that both parties attempt to heed the warning, but that in the\r\nstrain and exigency of the contest wild bullets still find their way into\r\nDouglas. The situation might justify me in ordering our troops to cross the\r\nborder and attempt to stop the fighting, or to fire upon both combatants\r\nfrom the American side. But if I take this step, I must face the\r\npossibility of resistance and greater bloodshed, and also the danger of\r\nhaving our motives misconstrued and misrepresented, and of thus inflaming\r\nMexican popular indignation against many thousand Americans now in Mexico\r\nand jeopardizing their lives and property. The pressure for general\r\nintervention under such conditions it might not be practicable to resist.\r\nIt is impossible to foresee or reckon the consequences of such a course,\r\nand we must use the greatest self-restraint to avoid it. Pending my urgent\r\nrepresentation to the Mexican Government, I can not therefore order the\r\ntroops at Douglas to cross the border, but I must ask you and the local\r\nauthorities, in case the same danger recurs, to direct the people of\r\nDouglas to place themselves where bullets can not reach them and thus avoid\r\ncasualty. I am loath to endanger Americans in Mexico, where they are\r\nnecessarily exposed, by taking a radical step to prevent injury to\r\nAmericans on our side of the border who can avoid it by a temporary\r\ninconvenience. I am glad to say that no further invasion of American rights\r\nof any substantial character occurred.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large military and naval force available for prompt\r\naction, near the Mexican border, proved to be most fortunate under the\r\nsomewhat trying conditions presented by this invasion of American rights\r\nHad no movement theretofore taken place, and because of these events it had\r\nbeen necessary then to bring about the mobilization, it must have had\r\nsinister significance. On the other hand, the presence of the troops before\r\nand at the time of the unfortunate killing and wounding of American\r\ncitizens at Douglas, made clear that the restraint exercised by our\r\nGovernment in regard to this Occurrence was not due to lack of force or\r\npower to deal with it promptly and aggressively, but was due to a real\r\ndesire to use every means possible to avoid direct intervention in the\r\naffairs of our neighbor whose friendship we valued and were most anxious to\r\nretain.\r\n\r\nThe policy and action of this Government were based upon an earnest\r\nfriendliness for the Mexican people as a whole, and it is a matter of\r\ngratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all\r\nfactions in Mexico and of sincere friendship for the neighboring nation,\r\nwithout regard for party allegiance, has been generally recognized and has\r\nresulted in an even closer and more sympathetic understanding between the\r\ntwo Republics and a warmer regard one for the other. Action to suppress\r\nviolence and restore tranquillity throughout the Mexican Republic was of\r\npeculiar interest to this Government, in that it concerned the safeguarding\r\nof American life and property in that country. The Government of the United\r\nStates had occasion to accord permission for the passage of a body of\r\nMexican rurales through Douglas, Arizona, to Tia Juana, Mexico, for the\r\nsuppression of general lawlessness which had for some time existed in the\r\nregion of northern Lower California. On May 25, 1911, President Diaz\r\nresigned, Senor de la Barra was chosen provisional President. Elections for\r\nPresident and Vice President were thereafter held throughout the Republic,\r\nand Senor Francisco I. Madero was formally declared elected on October 15\r\nto the chief magistracy. On November 6 President Madero entered upon the\r\nduties of his office.\r\n\r\nSince the inauguration of President Madero a plot has been unearthed\r\nagainst the present Government, to begin a new insurrection. Pursuing the\r\nsame consistent policy which this administration has adopted from the\r\nbeginning, it directed an investigation into the conspiracy charged, and\r\nthis investigation has resulted in the indictment of Gen. Bernardo Reyes\r\nand others and the seizure of a number of officers and men and horses and\r\naccoutrements assembled upon the soil of Texas for the purpose of invading\r\nMexico. Similar proceedings had been taken during the insurrection against\r\nthe Diaz Government resulting in the indictments and prosecution of persons\r\nfound to be engaged in violating the neutrality laws of the United States\r\nin aid of that uprising.\r\n\r\nThe record of this Government in respect of the recognition of constituted\r\nauthority in Mexico therefore is clear.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA-HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA TREATIES PROPOSED.\r\n\r\nAs to the situation in Central America, I have taken occasion in the past\r\nto emphasize most strongly the importance that should be attributed to the\r\nconsummation of the conventions between the Republics of Nicaragua and of\r\nHonduras and this country, and I again earnestly recommend that the\r\nnecessary advice and consent of the Senate be accorded to these treaties,\r\nwhich will make it possible for these Central American Republics to enter\r\nupon an era of genuine economic national development. The Government of\r\nNicaragua which has already taken favorable action on the convention, has\r\nfound it necessary, pending the exchange of final ratifications, to enter\r\ninto negotiations with American bankers for the purpose of securing a\r\ntemporary loan to relieve the present financial tension. III connection\r\nwith this temporary loan and in the hope of consummating, through the\r\nultimate operation of the convention, a complete and lasting economic\r\nregeneration, the Government of Nicaragua has also decided to engage an\r\nAmerican citizen as collector general of customs. The claims commission on\r\nwhich the services of two American citizens have been sought, and the work\r\nof the American financial adviser should accomplish a lasting good of\r\ninestimable benefit to the prosperity, commerce, and peace of the Republic.\r\nIn considering the ratification of the conventions with Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras, there rests with the United States the heavy responsibility of\r\nthe fact that their rejection here might destroy the progress made and\r\nconsign the Republics concerned to still deeper submergence in bankruptcy,\r\nrevolution, and national jeopardy. PANAMA.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Republic of Panama, peculiarly important, due to\r\nmutual obligations and the vast interests created by the canal, have\r\ncontinued in the usual friendly manner, and we have been glad to make\r\nappropriate expression of our attitude of sympathetic interest in the\r\nendeavors of our neighbor in undertaking the development of the rich\r\nresources of the country. With reference to the internal political affairs\r\nof the Republic, our obvious concern is in the maintenance of public peace\r\nand constitutional order, and the fostering of the general interests\r\ncreated by the actual relations of the two countries, without the\r\nmanifestation of any preference for the success of either of the political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nTHE PAN AMERICAN UNION.\r\n\r\nThe Pan American Union, formerly known as the Bureau of American Republics,\r\nmaintained by the joint contributions of all the American nations, has\r\nduring the past year enlarged its practical work as an international\r\norganization, and continues to prove its usefulness as an agency for the\r\nmutual development of commerce, better acquaintance, and closer intercourse\r\nbetween the United States and her sister American republics.\r\n\r\nTHE FAR EAST.\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE LOANS.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been marked in our relations with China by the conclusion\r\nof two important international loans, one for the construction of the\r\nHukuang railways, the other for carrying out of the currency reform to\r\nwhich China was pledged by treaties with the United States, Great Britain,\r\nand Japan, of which mention was made in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that early in 1909 an agreement was consummated among\r\nBritish, French, and German financial groups whereby they proposed to lend\r\nthe Chinese Government funds for the construction of railways in the\r\nProvinces of Hunan and Hupeh, reserving for their nationals the privilege\r\nof engineering the construction of the lines and of furnishing the\r\nmaterials required for the work. After negotiations with the Governments\r\nand groups concerned an agreement was reached whereby American, British,\r\nFrench, and German nationals should participate upon equal terms in this\r\nimportant and useful undertaking. Thereupon the financial groups, supported\r\nby their respective Governments, began negotiations with the Chinese\r\nGovernment which terminated in a loan to China Of $30,000,000, with the\r\nprivilege of increasing the amount to $50,000,000. The cooperative\r\nconstruction of these trunk lines should be of immense advantage,\r\nmaterially and otherwise, to China and should greatly facilitate the\r\ndevelopment of the bountiful resources of the Empire. On the other hand, a\r\nlarge portion of these funds is to be expended for materials, American\r\nproducts having equal preference with those of the other three lending\r\nnations, and as the contract provides for branches and extensions\r\nsubsequently to be built on the same terms the opportunities for American\r\nmaterials will reach considerable proportions.\r\n\r\nKnowing the interest of the United States in the reform of Chinese\r\ncurrency, the Chinese Government, in the autumn of 1910 sought the\r\nassistance of the American Government to procure funds with which to\r\naccomplish that all-important reform. In the course of the subsequent\r\nnegotiations there was combined with the proposed currency loan one for\r\ncertain industrial developments in Manchuria, the two loans aggregating the\r\nsum Of $50,000,000. While this was originally to be solely an American\r\nenterprise, the American Government, consistently with its desire to secure\r\na sympathetic and practical cooperation of the great powers toward\r\nmaintaining the principle of equality of opportunity and the administrative\r\nintegrity of China, urged the Chinese Government to admit to participation\r\nin the currency loan the associates of the American group in the Hukuang\r\nloan. While of immense importance in itself, the reform contemplated in\r\nmaking this loan is but preliminary to other and more comprehensive fiscal\r\nreforms which will be of incalculable benefit to China and foreign\r\ninterests alike, since they will strengthen the Chinese Empire and promote\r\nthe rapid development of international trade.\r\n\r\nNEUTRAL FINANCIAL ADVISER.\r\n\r\nWhen these negotiations were begun, it was understood that a financial\r\nadviser was to be employed by China in connection with the reform, and in\r\norder that absolute equality in all respects among the lending nations\r\nmight be scrupulously observed, the American Government proposed the\r\nnomination of a neutral adviser, which was agreed to by China and the other\r\nGovernments concerned. On September 28, 1911, Dr. Vissering, president of\r\nthe Dutch Java Bank and a financier of wide experience in the Orient, was\r\nrecommended to the Chinese Government for the post of monetary adviser.\r\n\r\nEspecially important at the present, when the ancient Chinese Empire is\r\nshaken by civil war incidental to its awakening to the many influences and\r\nactivities of modernization, are the cooperative policy of good\r\nunderstanding which has been fostered by the international projects\r\nreferred to above and the general sympathy of view among all the Powers\r\ninterested in the Far East. While safeguarding the interests of our\r\nnationals, this Government is using its best efforts in continuance of its\r\ntraditional policy of sympathy and friendship toward the Chinese Empire and\r\nits people, with the confident hope for their economic and administrative\r\ndevelopment, and with the constant disposition to contribute to their\r\nwelfare in all proper ways consistent with an attitude of strict\r\nimpartiality as between contending factions.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the two countries, a Chinese cruiser,\r\nthe Haichi, under the command of Admiral Ching, recently visited New York,\r\nwhere the officers and men were given a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nNEW JAPANESE TREATY.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan,\r\nsigned in 1894, would by a strict interpretation of its provisions have\r\nterminated on July 17, 1912. Japan's general treaties with the other\r\npowers, however, terminated in 1911, and the Japanese Government expressed\r\nan earnest desire to conduct the negotiations for a new treaty with the\r\nUnited States simultaneously with its negotiations with the other powers.\r\nThere were a number of important questions involved in the treaty,\r\nincluding the immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff, and\r\nthe right of Americans to hold real estate in Japan. The United States\r\nconsented to waive all technicalities and to enter at once upon\r\nnegotiations for a new treaty on the understanding that there should be a\r\ncontinuance throughout the, life of the treaty of the same effective\r\nmeasures for the restriction of immigration of laborers to American\r\nterritory which had been in operation with entire satisfaction to both\r\nGovernments since 1908. The Japanese Government accepted this basis of\r\nnegotiation, and a new treaty was quickly concluded, resulting in a highly\r\nsatisfactory settlement of the other questions referred to.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory adjustment has also been effected of the questions growing\r\nout of the annexation of Korea by Japan.\r\n\r\nThe recent visit of Admiral Count Togo to the United States as the Nation's\r\nguest afforded a welcome opportunity to demonstrate the friendly feeling so\r\nhappily existing between the two countries. SIAM.\r\n\r\nThere has been a change of sovereigns in Siam and the American minister at\r\nBangkok was accredited in a special capacity to represent the United States\r\nat the coronation ceremony of the new King.\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND THE NEAR EAST.\r\n\r\nIn Europe and the Near East, during the past twelve-month, there has been\r\nat times considerable political unrest. The Moroccan question, which for\r\nsome months was the cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached\r\na stage at which it need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman\r\nEmpire was occupied for a period by strife in Albania and is now at war\r\nwith Italy. In Greece and the Balkan countries the disquieting\r\npotentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has\r\nbeen the scene of a long internal struggle. These conditions have been the\r\ncause of uneasiness in European diplomacy, but thus far without direct\r\npolitical concern to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the war which unhappily exists between Italy and Turkey this Government\r\nhas no direct political interest, and I took occasion at the suitable time\r\nto issue a proclamation of neutrality in that conflict. At the same time\r\nall necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal interests of\r\nAmerican citizens and organizations in so far as affected by the war.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE WITH THE NEAR EAST.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the attendant economic uncertainties and detriments to\r\ncommerce, the United States has gained markedly in its commercial standing\r\nwith certain of the nations of the Near East. Turkey, especially, is\r\nbeginning to come into closer relations with the United States through the\r\nnew interest of American manufacturers and exporters in the possibilities\r\nof those regions, and it is hoped that foundations are being laid for a\r\nlarge and mutually beneficial exchange of commodities between the two\r\ncountries. This new interest of Turkey in American goods is indicated by\r\nthe fact that a party of prominent merchants from a large city in Turkey\r\nrecently visited the United States to study conditions of manufacture and\r\nexport here, and to get into personal touch with American merchants, with a\r\nview to cooperating more intelligently in opening up the markets of Turkey\r\nand the adjacent countries to our manufactures. Another indication of this\r\nnew interest of America in the commerce of the Near East is the recent\r\nvisit of a large party of American merchants and manufacturers to central\r\nand eastern Europe, where they were entertained by prominent officials and\r\norganizations of the large cities, and new bonds of friendship and\r\nunderstanding were established which can not but lead to closer and greater\r\ncommercial interchange.\r\n\r\nCORONATION OF KING GEORGE V.\r\n\r\nThe 22d of June of the present year marked the coronation of His Britannic\r\nMajesty King George V. In honor of this auspicious occasion I sent a\r\nspecial embassy to London. The courteous and cordial welcome extended to\r\nthis Government's representatives by His Majesty and the people of Great\r\nBritain has further emphasized the strong bonds of friendship happily\r\nexisting between the two nations.\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES WITH GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a determined effort on the part of both Great Britain and\r\nthe United States to settle all of their outstanding differences a number\r\nof treaties have been entered into between the two countries in recent\r\nyears, by which nearly all of the unsettled questions between them of any\r\nimportance have either been adjusted by agreement or arrangements made for\r\ntheir settlement by arbitration. A number of the unsettled questions\r\nreferred to consist of pecuniary claims presented by each country against\r\nthe other, and in order that as many of these claims as possible should be\r\nsettled by arbitration a special agreement for that purpose was entered\r\ninto between the two Governments on the 18th day of August, 1910, in\r\naccordance with Article 11 of the general arbitration treaty with Great\r\nBritain of April 4, 19o8. Pursuant to the provisions of this special\r\nagreement a schedule of claims has already been agreed upon, and the\r\nspecial agreement, together with this schedule, received the approval of\r\nthe Senate when submitted to it for that purpose at the last session of\r\nCongress. Negotiations between the two Governments for the preparation of\r\nan additional schedule of claims are already well advanced, and it is my\r\nintention to submit such schedule as soon as it is agreed upon to the\r\nSenate for its approval, in order that the arbitration proceedings may be\r\nundertaken at an early date. In this connection the attention of Congress\r\nis particularly called to the necessity for an appropriation\r\nto cover the expense incurred in submitting these claims to arbitration.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION TO GERMANY OF REPLICA OF VON STEUBEN STATUE.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of Congress, approved June 23, 1910, the Secretary\r\nof State and the joint Committee on the Library entered into a contract\r\nwith the sculptor, Albert Jaegers, for the execution of a bronze replica of\r\nthe statue of Gen. von Steuben erected in Washington, for presentation to\r\nHis Majesty the German Emperor and the German nation in recognition of the\r\ngift of the statue of Frederick the Great made by the Emperor to the people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe presentation was made on September 2 last by representatives whom I\r\ncommissioned as the special mission of this Government for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor has conveyed to me by telegraph, on his own behalf and\r\nthat of the German people, an expression of appreciative thanks for this\r\naction of Congress. RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the State Department, our ambassador to Russia has recently\r\nbeen having a series of conferences with the minister of foreign affairs of\r\nRussia, with a view to securing a clearer understanding and construction of\r\nthe treaty of 1832 between Russia and the United States and the\r\nmodification of any existing Russian regulations which may be found to\r\ninterfere in any way with the full recognition of the rights of American\r\ncitizens under this treaty. I believe that the Government of Russia is\r\naddressing itself seriously to the need of changing the present practice\r\nunder the treaty and that sufficient progress has been made to warrant the\r\ncontinuance of these conferences in the hope that there may soon be removed\r\nany justification of the complaints of treaty violation now prevalent in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nI expect that immediately after the Christmas recess I shall be able to\r\nmake a further communication to Congress on this subject. LIBERIA.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for the amelioration of conditions found to exist in Liberia\r\nby the American commission, undertaken through the Department of State,\r\nhave been concluded and it is only necessary for certain formalities to be\r\narranged in securing the loan which it is hoped will place that republic on\r\na practical financial and economic footing.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nThe National Constituent Assembly, regularly elected by the vote of the\r\nPortuguese people, having on June 19 last unanimously proclaimed a\r\nrepublican form of government, the official recognition of the Government\r\nof the United States was given to the new Republic in the afternoon of the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nSPITZBERGEN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for the betterment of conditions existing in the Spitzbergen\r\nIslands and the adjustment of conflicting claims of American citizens and\r\nNorwegian subjects to lands in that archipelago are still in progress.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary protocol to The he Hague convention for the establishment\r\nof an international prize court, mentioned in my last annual message,\r\nembodying stipulations providing for an alternative procedure which would\r\nremove the constitutional objection to that part of The Hague convention\r\nwhich provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the\r\ndecisions of national courts, has received the signature of the governments\r\nparties to the original convention and has been ratified by the Government\r\nof the United States, together with the prize court convention.\r\n\r\nThe deposit of the ratifications with the Government of the Netherlands\r\nawaits action by the powers on the declaration, signed at London on\r\nFebruary 26, 1909 of the rules of international law to be recognized within\r\nthe meaning of article 7 of The Hague convention for the establishment of\r\nan International Prize Court.\r\n\r\nFUR-SEAL TREATY.\r\n\r\nThe fur-seal controversy, which for nearly twenty-five years has been the\r\nsource of serious friction between the United States and the powers\r\nbordering upon the north Pacific Ocean, whose subjects have been permitted\r\nto engage in pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds having their\r\nbreeding grounds within the jurisdiction of the United States, has at last\r\nbeen satisfactorily adjusted by the conclusion of the north Pacific sealing\r\nconvention entered into between the United States, Great Britain, Japan,\r\nand Russia on the 7th of July last. This convention is a conservation\r\nmeasure of very great importance, and if it is carried out in the spirit of\r\nreciprocal concession and advantage upon which it is based, there is every\r\nreason to believe that not only will it result in preserving the fur-seal\r\nherds of the north Pacific Ocean and restoring them to their former value\r\nfor the purposes of commerce, but also that it will afford a permanently\r\nsatisfactory settlement of a question the only other solution of which\r\nseemed to be the total destruction of the fur seals. In another aspect,\r\nalso, this convention is of importance in that it furnishes an illustration\r\nof the feasibility of securing a general international game law for the\r\nprotection of other mammals of the sea, the preservation of which is of\r\nimportance to all the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is especially called to the necessity for\r\nlegislation on the part of the United States for the purpose of fulfilling\r\nthe obligations assumed under this convention, to which the Senate gave its\r\nadvice and consent on the 24th day of July last.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY UNION.\r\n\r\nThe conference of the International Union for the Protection of Industrial\r\nProperty, which, under the authority of Congress, convened at Washington on\r\nMay 16, 1911, closed its labors on June 2, 1911, by the signature of three\r\nacts, as follows:\r\n\r\n(I) A convention revising the Paris convention of March 20, 1883, for the\r\nprotection of industrial property, as modified by the additional act signed\r\nat Brussels on December 14, 1900;\r\n\r\n(2) An arrangement to replace the arrangement signed at Madrid on April 14,\r\n1891 for the international registration of trade-marks, and the additional\r\nact with regard thereto signed at Brussels on December 14, 1900; and\r\n\r\n(3) An arrangement to replace the arrangement signed at Madrid on April 14,\r\n1891, relating to the repression of false indication of production of\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a signatory of the first convention only, and this\r\nwill be promptly submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL OPIUM COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nIn a special message transmitted to the Congress on the 11th of January,\r\n1911, in which I concurred in the recommendations made by the Secretary of\r\nState in regard to certain needful legislation for the control of our\r\ninterstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drugs, I quoted\r\nfrom my annual message of December 7, 1909, in which I announced that the\r\nresults of the International Opium Commission held at Shanghai in February,\r\n1909, at the invitation of the United States, had been laid before this\r\nGovernment; that the report of that commission showed that China was making\r\nremarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradication of the\r\nopium evil; that the interested governments had not permitted their\r\ncommercial interests to prevent their cooperation in this reform; and, as a\r\nresult of collateral investigations of the opium question in this country,\r\nI recommended that the manufacture, sale, and use of opium in the United\r\nStates should be more rigorously controlled by legislation.\r\n\r\nPrior to that time and in continuation of the policy of this Government to\r\nsecure the cooperation of the interested nations, the United States\r\nproposed an international opium conference with full powers for the purpose\r\nof clothing with the force of international law the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe above-mentioned commission, together with their essential corollaries.\r\nThe other powers concerned cordially responded to the proposal of this\r\nGovernment, and, I am glad to be able to announce, representatives of all\r\nthe powers assembled in conference at The Hague on the first of this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of the opium-exclusion act, more than twenty States have\r\nbeen animated to modify their pharmacy laws and bring them in accord with\r\nthe spirit of that act, thus stamping out, to a measure, the intrastate\r\ntraffic in opium and other habit-forming drugs. But, although I have urged\r\non the Congress the passage of certain measures for Federal control of the\r\ninterstate and foreign traffic in these drugs, no action has yet been\r\ntaken. In view of the fact that there is now sitting at The Hague so\r\nimportant a conference, which has under review the municipal laws of the\r\ndifferent nations for the mitigation of their opium and other allied evils,\r\na conference which will certainly deal with the international aspects of\r\nthese evils, it seems to me most essential that the Congress should take\r\nimmediate action on the anti-narcotic legislation to which I have already\r\ncalled attention by a special message.\r\n\r\nBUENOS AIRES CONVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe four important conventions signed at the Fourth Pan American Conference\r\nat Buenos Aires, providing for the regulation of trademarks, patents, and\r\ncopyrights, and for the arbitration of pecuniary claims, have, with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, been ratified on the part of the United\r\nStates and the ratifications have been deposited with the Government of the\r\nArgentine Republic in accordance with the requirements of the conventions.\r\nI am not advised that similar action has been taken by any other of the\r\nsignatory governments.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ARRANGEMENT TO SUPPRESS OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable advances in international morality accomplished in\r\nrecent years was an arrangement entered into on April 13th of the present\r\nyear between the United States and other powers for the repression of the\r\ncirculation of obscene publications.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TRADE RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I referred to the tariff negotiations of the\r\nDepartment of State with foreign countries in connection with the\r\napplication, by a series of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the\r\nUnited States to importations from the several countries, and I stated\r\nthat, in its general operation, section 2 of the new tariff law had proved\r\na guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there were,\r\nunfortunately, instances where foreign governments dealt arbitrarily with\r\nAmerican interests within their jurisdiction in a manner injurious and\r\ninequitable. During the past year some instances of discriminatory\r\ntreatment have been removed, but I regret to say that there remain a few\r\ncases of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the United\r\nStates. While none of these instances now appears to amount to undue\r\ndiscrimination in the sense of section 2 Of the tariff law of August 5,\r\n1909, they are all exceptions to that complete degree of equality of tariff\r\ntreatment that the Department of State has consistently sought to obtain\r\nfor American commerce abroad.\r\n\r\nWhile the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 1909 has been amply\r\njustified by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new,\r\nundue discriminations against American commerce it is believed that the\r\ntime has come for the amendment of this feature of the law in such way as\r\nto provide a graduated means of meeting varying degrees of discriminatory\r\ntreatment of American commerce in foreign countries as well as to protect\r\nthe financial interests abroad of American citizens against arbitrary and\r\ninjurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either\r\nlegislative or administrative measures.\r\n\r\nIt would seem desirable that the maximum tariff of the United States should\r\nembrace within its purview the free list, which is not the case at the\r\npresent time, in order that it might have reasonable significance to the\r\ngovernments of those countries from which the importations into the United\r\nStates are confined virtually to articles on the free list.\r\n\r\nRECORD OF HIGHEST AMOUNT OF FOREIGN TRADE.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal year ended June 30, 1911, shows great progress in the\r\ndevelopment of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the highest\r\nrecord of exports of American products to foreign countries, the valuation\r\nbeing in excess of $2,000,000,000. These exports showed a gain over the\r\npreceding year of more than $300,000,000.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES FOR FOREIGN TRADE FURNISHED BY JOINT ACTION OF DEPARTMENT OF\r\nSTATE AND OF COMMERCE AND LABOR.\r\n\r\nThere is widespread appreciation expressed by the business interests of the\r\ncountry as regards the practical value of the facilities now offered by the\r\nDepartment of State and the Department of Commerce and Labor for the\r\nfurtherance of American commerce. Conferences with their officers at\r\nWashington who have an expert knowledge of trade conditions in foreign\r\ncountries and with consular officers and commercial agents of the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor who, while on leave of absence, visit the\r\nprincipal industrial centers of the United States, have been found of great\r\nvalue. These trade conferences are regarded as a particularly promising\r\nmethod of governmental aid in foreign trade promotion. The Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor has arranged to give publicity to the expected arrival\r\nand the itinerary of consular officers and commercial agents while on leave\r\nin the United States, in order that trade organizations may arrange for\r\nconferences with them.\r\n\r\nAs I have indicated, it is increasingly clear that to obtain and maintain\r\nthat equity and substantial equality of treatment essential to the\r\nflourishing foreign trade, which becomes year by year more important to the\r\nindustrial and commercial welfare of the United States, we should have a\r\nflexibility of tariff sufficient for the give and take of negotiation by\r\nthe Department of State on behalf of our commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nCRYING NEED FOR AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE.\r\n\r\nI need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be built\r\nup an American merchant marine. This is necessary to assure favorable\r\ntransportation facilities to our great ocean-borne commerce as well as to\r\nsupplement the Navy with an adequate reserve of ships and men It would have\r\nthe economic advantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid\r\nforeign shipping for carrying American goods. All the great commercial\r\nnations pay heavy subsidies to their merchant marine so that it is obvious\r\nthat without some wise aid from the Congress the United States must lag\r\nbehind in the matter of merchant marine in its present anomalous position.\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF AMERICAN BANKING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nLegislation to facilitate the extension of American banks to foreign\r\ncountries is another matter in which our foreign trade needs assistance.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERS OF FOREIGN COMMERCE SUGGESTED.\r\n\r\nThe interests of our foreign commerce are nonpartisan, and as a factor in\r\nprosperity are as broad as the land. In the dissemination of useful\r\ninformation and in the coordination of effort certain unofficial\r\nassociations have done good work toward the promotion of foreign commerce.\r\nIt is cause for regret, however, that the great number of such associations\r\nand the comparative lack of cooperation between them fails to secure an\r\nefficiency commensurate with the public interest. Through the agency of the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, and in some cases directly, the\r\nDepartment of State transmits to reputable business interests information\r\nof commercial opportunities, supplementing the regular published consular\r\nreports. Some central organization in touch with associations and chambers\r\nof commerce throughout the country and able to keep purely American\r\ninterests in closer touch with different phases of commercial affairs\r\nwould, I believe, be of great value. Such organization might be managed by\r\na committee composed of a small number of those now actively carrying on\r\nthe work of some of the larger associations, and there might be added to\r\nthe committee, as members ex officio, one or two officials of the\r\nDepartment of State and one or two officials from the Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor and representatives of the appropriate committees of\r\nCongress. The authority and success of such an organization would evidently\r\nbe enhanced if the Congress should see fit to prescribe its scope and\r\norganization through legislation which would give to it some such official\r\nstanding as that, for example, of the National Red Cross.\r\n\r\nWith these factors and the continuance of the foreign-service establishment\r\n(departmental, diplomatic, and consular) upon the high plane where it has\r\nbeen placed by the recent reorganization this Government would be abreast\r\nof the times in fostering the interests of its foreign trade, and the rest\r\nmust be left to the energy and enterprise of our business men.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.\r\n\r\nThe entire foreign-service organization is being improved and developed\r\nwith especial regard to the requirements of the commercial interests of the\r\ncountry. The rapid growth of our foreign trade makes it of the utmost\r\nimportance that governmental agencies through which that trade is to be\r\naided and protected should possess a high degree of efficiency. Not only\r\nshould the foreign representatives be maintained upon a generous scale in\r\nso far as salaries and establishments are concerned, but the selection and\r\nadvancement of officers should be definitely and permanently regulated by\r\nlaw so that the service shall not fail to attract men of high character and\r\nability. The experience of the past few years with a partial application of\r\ncivil-service rules to the Diplomatic and Consular Service leaves no doubt\r\nin my mind of the wisdom of a wider and more permanent extension of those\r\nprinciples to both branches of the foreign service. The men selected for\r\nappointment by means of the existing executive regulations have been of a\r\nfar higher average of intelligence and ability than the men appointed\r\nbefore the regulations were promulgated. Moreover, the feeling that under\r\nthe existing rules there is reasonable hope for permanence of tenure during\r\ngood behavior and for promotion for meritorious service has served to bring\r\nabout a zealous activity in the interests of the country, which never\r\nbefore existed or could exist. It is my earnest conviction that the\r\nenactment into law of the general principles of the existing regulations\r\ncan not fail to effect further improvement in both branches of the foreign\r\nservice by providing greater inducement for young men of character and\r\nability to seek a career abroad in the service of the Government, and an\r\nincentive to those already in the service to put forth greater efforts to\r\nattain the high standards which the successful conduct of our international\r\nrelations and commerce requires.\r\n\r\nI therefore again commend to the favorable action of the Congress the\r\nenactment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the\r\nprinciples embodied in section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United\r\nStates, in the civil-service act of January 16, 1883, and the Executive\r\norders of June 27, 1906, and of November 26, 1909. In its consideration of\r\nthis important subject I desire to recall to the attention of the Congress\r\nthe very favorable report made on the Lowden bill for the improvement of\r\nthe foreign service by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Available statistics show the strictness with which the\r\nmerit system has been applied to the foreign service during recent years\r\nand the absolute nonpartisan selection of consuls and diplomatic-service\r\nsecretaries who, indeed, far from being selected with any view to political\r\nconsideration, have actually been chosen to a disproportionate extent from\r\nStates which would have been unrepresented in the foreign service under the\r\nsystem which it is to be hoped is now permanently obsolete. Some\r\nlegislation for the perpetuation of the present system of examinations and\r\npromotions upon merit and efficiency would be of greatest value to our\r\ncommercial and international interests.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, December 20, 1911. To the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress, December, 1909, I stated that under\r\nsection 2 of the act of August 5, 1909, I had appointed a Tariff Board of\r\nthree members to cooperate with the State Department in the administration\r\nof the maximum and minimum clause of that act, to make a glossary or\r\nencyclopedia of the existing tariff so as to render its terms intelligible\r\nto the ordinary reader, and then to investigate industrial conditions and\r\ncosts of production at home and abroad with a view to determining to what\r\nextent existing tariff rates actually exemplify the protective principle,\r\nviz., that duties should be made adequate, and only adequate, to equalize\r\nthe difference in cost of production at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nI further stated that I believed these investigations would be of great\r\nvalue as a basis for accurate legislation, and that I should from time to\r\ntime recommend to Congress the revision of certain schedules in accordance\r\nwith the findings of the Board.\r\n\r\nIn the last session of the Sixty-first Congress a bill creating a permanent\r\nTariff Board of five members, of whom not more than three should be of the\r\nsame political party, passed each House, but failed of enactment because of\r\nslight differences on which agreement was not reached before adjournment.\r\nAn appropriation act provided that the permanent Tariff Board, if created\r\nby statute, should report to Congress on Schedule K in December, 1911.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to carry out so far as lay within my power the purposes of this\r\nbill for a permanent Tariff Board, I appointed in March, 1911, a board of\r\nfive, adding two members of such party affiliation as would have fulfilled\r\nthe statutory requirement, and directed them to make a report to me on\r\nSchedule K of the tariff act in December of this year.\r\n\r\nIn my message of August 17, 1911, accompanying the veto of the wool bill, I\r\nsaid that, in my judgment, Schedule K should be revised and the rates\r\nreduced. My veto was based on the ground that, since the Tariff Board would\r\nmake, in December, a detailed report on wool and wool manufactures, with\r\nspecial reference to the relation of the existing rates of duties to\r\nrelative costs here and abroad, public policy and a fair regard to the\r\ninterests of the producers and the manufacturers on the one hand and of the\r\nconsumers on the other demanded that legislation should not be hastily\r\nenacted in the absence of such information; that I was not myself possessed\r\nat that time of adequate knowledge of the facts to determine whether or not\r\nthe proposed act was in accord with my pledge to support a fair and\r\nreasonable protective policy; that such legislation might prove only\r\ntemporary and inflict upon a great industry the evils of continued\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nI now herewith submit a report of the Tariff Board on Schedule K. The board\r\nis unanimous in its findings. On the basis of these findings I now\r\nrecommend that the Congress proceed to a consideration of this schedule\r\nwith a view to its revision and a general reduction of its rates.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the present method of assessing the duty on raw\r\nWool--this is, by a specific rate on the grease pound (i. e., unscoured)\r\n--operates to exclude wools of high shrinkage in scouring but fine quality\r\nfrom the American market and thereby lessens the range of wools available\r\nto the domestic manufacturer; that the duty on scoured wool Of 33 cents per\r\npound is prohibitory and operates to exclude the importation of clean,\r\nlow-priced foreign wools of inferior grades, which are nevertheless\r\nvaluable material for manufacturing, and which can not be imported in the\r\ngrease because of their heavy shrinkage. Such wools, if imported, might be\r\nused to displace the cheap substitutes now in use.\r\n\r\nTo make the preceding paragraph a little plainer, take the instance of a\r\nhundred pounds of first-class wool imported under the present duty, which\r\nis 11 cents a pound. That would make the duty on the hundred pounds $11.\r\nThe merchantable part of the wool thus imported is the weight of the wool\r\nof this hundred pounds after scouring. If the wool shrinks 80 per cent, as\r\nsome wools do, then the duty in such a case would amount to $11 $11 on 20\r\npounds of scoured wool. This, of course, would be prohibitory. If the wool\r\nshrinks only 50 per cent, it would be $11 on 50 pounds of wool, and this is\r\nnear to the average of the great bulk of wools that are imported from\r\nAustralia, which is the principal source of our imported wool.\r\n\r\nThese discriminations could be overcome by assessing a duty in ad valorem\r\nterms, but this method is open to the objection, first, that it increases\r\nadministrative difficulties and tends to decrease revenue through\r\nundervaluation; and, second, that as prices advance, the ad valorem rate\r\nincreases the duty per pound at the time when the consumer most needs\r\nrelief and the producer can best stand competition; while if prices decline\r\nthe duty is decreased at the time when the consumer is least burdened by\r\nthe price and the producer most needs protection.\r\n\r\nAnother method of meeting the difficulty of taxing the grease pound is to\r\nassess a specific duty on grease wool in terms of its scoured content. This\r\nobviates the chief evil of the present system, namely, the discrimination\r\ndue to different shrinkages, and thereby tends greatly to equalize the\r\nduty. The board reports that this method is feasible in practice and could\r\nbe administered without great expense. The scoured content of the wool is\r\nthe basis on which users of wool make their calculations, and a duty of\r\nthis kind would fit the usages of the trade. One effect of this method of\r\nassessment would be that, regardless of the rate of duty, there would be\r\nan increase in the supply and variety of wool by making available to the\r\nAmerican market wools of both low and fine quality now excluded.\r\n\r\nThe report shows in detail the difficulties involved in attempting to state\r\nin categorical terms the cost of wool production and the great differences\r\nin cost as between different regions and different types of wool. It is\r\nfound, however, that, taking all varieties in account, the average cost of\r\nproduction for the whole American clip is higher than the cost in the chief\r\ncompeting country by an amount somewhat less than the present duty.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that the duties on wools, wool wastes, and shoddy, which\r\nare adjusted to the rate Of 33 cents on scoured wool are prohibitory in the\r\nsame measure that the duty on scoured wool is prohibitory. In general, they\r\nare assessed at rates as high as, or higher than, the duties paid on the\r\nclean content of wools actually imported. They should be reduced and so\r\nadjusted to the rate on wool as to bear their proper proportion to the real\r\nrate levied on the actual wool imports.\r\n\r\nThe duties on many classes of wool manufacture are prohibitory and greatly\r\nin excess of the difference in cost of production here and abroad.\r\n\r\nThis is true of tops, of yarns (with the exception of worsted yarns of a\r\nvery high grade), and of low and medium grade cloth of heavy weight.\r\n\r\nOn tops up to 52 cents a pound in value, and on yarns of 65 cents in value,\r\nthe rate is 100 per cent with correspondingly higher rates for lower\r\nvalues. On cheap and medium grade cloths, the existing rates frequently run\r\nto 150 per cent and on some cheap goods to over 200 per cent. This is\r\nlargely due to that part of the duty which is levied ostensibly to\r\ncompensate the manufacturer for the enhanced cost of his raw material due\r\nto the duty on wool. As a matter of fact, this compensatory duty, for\r\nnumerous classes of goods, is much in excess of the amount needed for\r\nstrict compensation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the findings show that the duties which run to such high\r\nad valorem equivalents are prohibitory, since the goods are not imported,\r\nbut that the prices of domestic fabrics are not raised by the full amount\r\nof duty. On a set of 1-yard samples of 16 English fabrics, which are\r\ncompletely excluded by the present tariff rates, it was found that the\r\ntotal foreign value was $41.84; the duties which would have been assessed\r\nhad these fabrics been imported, $76.90; the foreign value plus the amount\r\nof the duty, $118.74; or a nominal duty of 183 per cent. In fact, however,\r\npractically identical fabrics of domestic make sold at the same time at\r\n$69.75, showing an enhanced price over the foreign market value of but 67\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nAlthough these duties do not increase prices of domestic goods by anything\r\nlike their full amount, it is none the less true that such prohibitive\r\nduties eliminate the possibility of foreign competition, even in time of\r\nscarcity; that they form a temptation to monopoly and conspiracies to\r\ncontrol domestic prices; that they are much in excess of the difference in\r\ncost of production here and abroad, and that they should be reduced to a\r\npoint which accords with this principle.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the board show that in this industry the actual\r\nmanufacturing cost, aside from the question of the price of materials, is\r\nmuch higher in this country than it is abroad; that in the making of yarn\r\nand cloth the domestic woolen or worsted manufacturer has in general no\r\nadvantage in the form of superior machinery or more efficient labor to\r\noffset the higher wages paid in this country The findings show that the\r\ncost of turning wool into yarn in this country is about double that in the\r\nleading competing country, and that the cost of turning yarn into cloth is\r\nsomewhat more than double. Under the protective policy a great industry,\r\ninvolving the welfare of hundreds of thousands of people, has been\r\nestablished despite these handicaps.\r\n\r\nIn recommending revision and reduction, I therefore urge that action be\r\ntaken with these facts in mind, to the end that an important and\r\nestablished industry may not be jeopardized.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Board reports that no equitable method has been found to, levy\r\npurely specific duties on woolen and worsted fabrics and that, excepting\r\nfor a compensatory duty, the rate must be ad valorem on such manufactures.\r\nIt is important to realize, however, that no flat ad valorem rate on such\r\nfabrics can be made to work fairly and effectively. Any single rate which\r\nis high enough to equalize the difference in manufacturing cost at home and\r\nabroad on highly finished goods involving such labor would be prohibitory\r\non cheaper goods, in which the labor cost is a smaller proportion of the\r\ntotal value. Conversely, a rate only adequate to equalize this difference\r\non cheaper goods would remove protection from the fine-goods manufacture,\r\nthe increase in which has been one of the striking features of the trade's\r\ndevelopment in recent years. I therefore recommend that in any revision the\r\nimportance of a graduated scale of ad valorem duties on cloths be carefully\r\nconsidered and applied.\r\n\r\nI venture to say that no legislative body has ever had presented to it a\r\nmore complete and exhaustive report than this on so difficult and\r\ncomplicated a subject as the relative costs of wool and woolens the world\r\nover. It is a monument to the thoroughness, industry, impartiality, and\r\naccuracy of the men engaged in its making. They were chosen from both\r\npolitical parties but have allowed no partisan spirit to prompt or control\r\ntheir inquiries. They are unanimous in their findings. I feel sure that\r\nafter the report has been printed and studied the value of such a\r\ncompendium of exact knowledge in respect to this schedule of the tariff\r\nwill convince all of the wisdom of making such a board permanent in order\r\nthat it may treat each schedule of the tariff as it has treated this, and\r\nthen keep its bureau of information up to date with current changes in the\r\neconomic world.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the function of the Tariff Board to propose rates of duty.\r\nTheir function is merely to present findings of fact on which rates of duty\r\nmay be fairly determined in the light of adequate knowledge in accord with\r\nthe economic policy to be followed. This is what the present report does.\r\n\r\nThe findings of fact by the board show ample reason for the revision\r\ndownward of Schedule K, in accord with the protective principle, and\r\npresent the data as to relative costs and prices from which may be\r\ndetermined what rates will fairly equalize the difference in production\r\ncosts. I recommend that such revision be proceeded with at once.\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, December 21, 1911. To the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of the Government, as shown at the close of the\r\nlast fiscal year, June 30, 1911, was very satisfactory. The ordinary\r\nreceipts into the general fund, excluding postal revenues, amounted to\r\n$701,372,374.99, and the disbursements from the general fund for current\r\nexpenses and capital outlays, excluding postal and Panama Canal\r\ndisbursements, including the interest on the public debt, amounted to\r\n$654,137,907-89, leaving a surplus Of $47,234,377.10.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenue receipts amounted to $237,879,823,60, while the payments\r\nmade for the postal service from the postal revenues amounted to\r\n$237,660,705.48, which left a surplus of postal receipts over disbursements\r\nOf $219,118.12, the first time in 27 years in which a surplus occurred.\r\n\r\nThe interest-bearing debt of the United States June 30, 1911, amounted to\r\n$915,353,190. The debt on which interest had ceased amounted to\r\n$1,879,830.26, and the debt bearing no interest, including greenbacks,\r\nnational bank notes to be redeemed, and fractional currency, amounted to\r\n$386,751,917-43, or a total of interest and noninterest bearing debt\r\namounting to $1,303,984,937.69.\r\n\r\nThe actual disbursements, exclusive of those for the Panama Canal and for\r\nthe postal service for the year ending June 30, 1911, were $654,137,997.89.\r\nThe actual disbursements for the year ending June 30, 1910, exclusive of\r\nthe Panama Canal and the postal service disbursements, were\r\n$659,705,391.08, making a decrease Of $5,567,393.19 in yearly expenditures\r\nin the year 1911 under that of 1910. For the year ending June 30, 1912, the\r\nestimated receipts, exclusive of the postal revenues, are $666,000,000,\r\nwhile the total estimates, exclusive of those for the Panama Canal and the\r\npostal expenditures payable from the postal revenues, amount to\r\n$645,842,799.34. This is a decrease in the 1912 estimates from that of the\r\n1911 estimates of $1,534,367-22.\r\n\r\nFor the year ending June 30, 1913, the estimated receipts, exclusive of the\r\npostal revenues, are $667,000,000, while the total estimated\r\nappropriations, exclusive of the Panama Canal and postal disbursements\r\npayable from postal revenues, will amount to $637,920,803.35. This is a\r\ndecrease in the 1913 estimates from that of the 1912 estimates of\r\n$7,921,995.99.\r\n\r\nAs to the postal revenues, the expansion of the business in that\r\ndepartment, the normal increase in the Post Office and the extension of the\r\nservice, will increase the outlay to the sum Of $260,938,463; but as the\r\ndepartment was self-sustaining this year the Postmaster General is assured\r\nthat next year the receipts will at least equal the expenditures, and\r\nprobably exceed them by more than the surplus of this year. It is fair and\r\nequitable, therefore, in determining the economy with which the Government\r\nhas been run, to exclude the transactions of a department like the Post\r\nOffice Department, which relies for its support upon its receipts. In\r\ncalculations heretofore made for comparison of economy in each year, it has\r\nbeen the proper custom only to include in the statement the deficit in the\r\nPost Office Department which was paid out of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nA calculation of the actual increase in the expenses of Government arising\r\nfrom the increase in the population and the general expansion of\r\ngovernmental functions, except those of the Post Office, for a number of\r\nyears shows a normal increase of about 4 per cent a year. By directing the\r\nexercise of great care to keep down the expenses and the estimates we have\r\nsucceeded in reducing the total disbursements each year.\r\n\r\nTHE CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe credit of this Government was shown to be better than that of any other\r\nGovernment by the sale of the Panama Canal 3 per cent bonds. These bonds\r\ndid not give their owners the privilege of using them as a basis for\r\nbank-note circulation, nor was there any other privilege extended to them\r\nwhich would affect their general market value. Their sale, therefore,\r\nmeasured the credit of the Government. The premium which was realized upon\r\nthe bonds made the actual interest rate of the transaction 2.909 per cent.\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nI In the Treasury Department the efficiency and economy work has been kept\r\nsteadily up. Provision is made for the elimination of 134 positions during\r\nthe coming year. Two hundred and sixty-seven statutory positions were\r\neliminated during the last year in the office of the Treasury in\r\nWashington, and 141 positions in the year 1910, making an elimination Of\r\n542 statutory positions since March 4, 1909; and this has been done without\r\nthe discharge of anybody, because the normal resignations and deaths have\r\nbeen equal to the elimination of the places, a system of transfers having\r\ntaken care of the persons whose positions were dropped out. In the field\r\nservice if the department, too, 1,259 positions have been eliminated down\r\nto the present time, making a total net reduction of all Treasury positions\r\nto the number of 1,801. Meantime the efficiency of the work of the\r\ndepartment has increased.\r\n\r\nMONETARY REFORM.\r\n\r\nA matter of first importance that will come before Congress for action at\r\nthis session is monetary reform. The Congress has itself arranged an early\r\nintroduction of this great question through the report of its Monetary\r\nCommission. This commission was appointed to recommend a solution of the\r\nbanking and currency problems so long confronting the Nation and to furnish\r\nthe facts and data necessary to enable the Congress to take action. The\r\ncommission was appointed when an impressive and urgent popular demand for\r\nlegislative relief suddenly arose out of the distressing situation of the\r\npeople caused by the deplorable panic of 1907. The Congress decided that\r\nwhile it could not give immediately the relief required, it would provide a\r\ncommission to furnish the means for prompt action at a later date.\r\n\r\nIn order to do its work with thoroughness and precision this commission has\r\ntaken some time to make its report. The country is undoubtedly hoping for\r\nas prompt action on the report as the convenience of the Congress can\r\npermit. The recognition of the gross imperfections and marked inadequacy of\r\nour banking and currency system even in our most quiet financial periods is\r\nof long standing; and later there has matured a recognition of the fact\r\nthat our system is responsible for the extraordinary devastation, waste,\r\nand business paralysis of our recurring periods of panic. Though the\r\nmembers of the Monetary Commission have for a considerable time been\r\nworking in the open, and while large numbers of the people have been openly\r\nworking with them, and while the press has largely noted and discussed this\r\nwork as it has proceeded, so that the report of the commission promises to\r\nrepresent a national movement, the details of the report are still being\r\nconsidered. I can not, therefore, do much more at this time than commend\r\nthe immense importance of monetary reform, urge prompt consideration and\r\naction when the commission's report is received, and express my\r\nsatisfaction that the plan to be proposed promises to embrace main features\r\nthat, having met the approval of a great preponderance of the practical and\r\nprofessional opinion of the country, are likely to meet equal approval in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly fortunate that the wise and undisputed policy of\r\nmaintaining unchanged the main features of our banking system rendered it\r\nat once impossible to introduce a central bank; for a central bank would\r\ncertainly have been resisted, and a plan into which it could have been\r\nintroduced would probably have been defeated. But as a central bank could\r\nnot be a part of the only plan discussed or considered, that troublesome\r\nquestion is eliminated. And ingenious and novel as the proposed National\r\nReserve Association appears, it simply is a logical outgrowth of what is\r\nbest in our present system, and is, in fact, the fulfillment of that\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nExactly how the management of that association should be organized is a\r\nquestion still open. It seems to be desirable that the banks which would\r\nown the association should in the main manage it, It will be an agency of\r\nthe banks to act for them, and they can be trusted better than anybody else\r\nchiefly to conduct it. It is mainly bankers' work. But there must be some\r\nform of Government supervision and ultimate control, and I favor a\r\nreasonable representation of the Government in the management. I entertain\r\nno fear of the introduction of politics or of any undesirable influences\r\nfrom a properly measured Government representation.\r\n\r\nI trust that all banks of the country possessing the requisite standards\r\nwill be placed upon a footing of perfect equality of opportunity. Both the\r\nNational system and the State system should be fairly recognized, leaving\r\nthem eventually to coalesce if that shall prove to be their tendency. But\r\nsuch evolution can not develop impartially if the banks of one system are\r\ngiven or permitted any advantages of opportunity over those of the other\r\nsystem. And I trust also that the new legislation will carefully and\r\ncompletely protect and assure the individuality and the independence of\r\neach bank, to the end that any tendency there may ever be toward a\r\nconsolidation of the money or banking power of the Nation shall be\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nIt will always be possible, of course, to correct any features of the new\r\nlaw which may in practice prove to be unwise; so that while this law is\r\nsure to be enacted under conditions of unusual knowledge and authority, it\r\nalso will include, it is well to remember, the possibility of future\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nWith the present prospects of this long-awaited reform encouraging us, it\r\nwould be singularly unfortunate if this monetary question should by any\r\nchance become a party issue. And I sincerely hope it will not. The\r\nexceeding amount of consideration it has received from the people of the\r\nNation has been wholly nonpartisan; and the Congress set its nonpartisan\r\nseal upon it when the Monetary Commission was appointed. In commending the\r\nquestion to the favorable consideration of Congress, I speak for, and in\r\nthe spirit of, the great number of my fellow citizens who without any\r\nthought of party or partisanship feel with remarkable earnestness that this\r\nreform is necessary to the interests of all the people.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThere is now before Congress a Dill, the purpose of which is to increase\r\nthe efficiency and decrease the expense of the Army. It contains four\r\nprincipal features: First, a consolidation of the General Staff with the\r\nAdjutant General's and the Inspector General's Departments; second, a\r\nconsolidation of the Quartermaster's Department with the Subsistence and\r\nthe Pay Departments; third, the creation of an Army Service Corps; and\r\nfourth, an extension of the enlistment period from three to five years.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of an Army Service Corps, as proposed in the bill, I\r\nam thoroughly in accord and am convinced that the establishment of such a\r\ncorps will result in a material economy and a very great increase of\r\nefficiency in the Army. It has repeatedly been recommended by me and my\r\npredecessors. I also believe that a consolidation of the Staff Corps can be\r\nmade with a resulting increase in efficiency and economy, but not along the\r\nlines provided in the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nI am opposed to any plan the result of which would be to break up or\r\ninterfere with the essential principles of the detail system in the Staff\r\nCorps established by the act of February 2, 1901, and I am opposed to any\r\nplan the result of which would be to give to the officer selected as Chief\r\nof Staff or to any other member of the General Staff Corps greater\r\npermanency of office than he now has. Under the existing law neither the\r\nChief. of Staff nor any other member of the General Staff Corps can remain\r\nin office for a period of more than four years, and there must be an\r\ninterval of two years between successive tours of duty.\r\n\r\nThe bill referred to provides that certain persons shall become permanent\r\nmembers of the General Staff Corps, and that certain others are subject to\r\nre-detail without an interval of two years. Such provision is fraught with\r\ndanger to the welfare of the Army, and would practically nullify the main\r\npurpose of the law creating the [missing text].\r\n\r\nIn making the consolidations no reduction should be made in the total\r\nnumber of officers of the Army, of whom there are now too few to perform\r\nthe duties imposed by law. I have in the past recommended an increase in\r\nthe number of officers by 600 in order to provide sufficient officers to\r\nperform all classes of staff duty and to reduce the number of line officers\r\ndetached from their commands. Congress at the last session increased the\r\ntotal number of officers by 200, but this is not enough. Promotion in the\r\nline of the Army is too slow. Officers do not attain command rank at an age\r\nearly enough properly to exercise it. It would be a mistake further to\r\nretard this already slow promotion by throwing back into the line of the\r\nArm a number of high-ranking officers to be absorbed as is provided in the\r\n[missing text].\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the bill which I believe to be a mistake is the proposed\r\nincrease in the term of enlistment from three to five ears I believe it\r\nwould be better to enlist men for six years, release them at the end of\r\nthree years from active service, and put them in reserve for the remaining\r\nthree years. Reenlistments should be largely confined to the\r\nnoncommissioned officers and other enlisted men in the skilled grades. This\r\nplan by the payment of a comparatively small compensation during the three\r\nyears of reserve, would keep a large body of men at the call of the\r\nGovernment, trained and ready for [missing text].\r\n\r\nThe Army of the United States is in good condition. It showed itself able\r\nto meet an emergency in the successful mobilization of an army division of\r\nfrom 15,000 to 20,000 men, which took place along the border of Mexico\r\nduring the recent disturbances in that country. The marvelous freedom from\r\nthe ordinary camp diseases of typhoid fever and measles is referred to in\r\nthe report of the Secretary of War and shows such an effectiveness in the\r\nsanitary regulations and treatment of the Medical Corps, and in the\r\ndiscipline of the Army itself, as to invoke the highest commendation.\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL AMPHITHEATER AT ARLINGTON.\r\n\r\nI beg to renew my recommendation of last year that the Congress appropriate\r\nfor a memorial amphitheater at Arlington, Va., the funds required to\r\nconstruct it upon the plans already approved.\r\n\r\nTHE PANAMA CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe very satisfactory progress made on the Panama Canal last year has\r\ncontinued, and there is every reason to believe that the canal\r\nwill be completed as early as the 1st of July, 1913, unless something\r\nunforeseen occurs. This is about 18 months before the time promised by the\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nWe are now near enough the completion of the canal to make it imperatively\r\nnecessary that legislation should be enacted to fix the method by which the\r\ncanal shall be maintained and controlled and the zone governed. The fact is\r\nthat to-day there is no statutory law by authority of which the President\r\nis maintaining the government of the zone. Such authority was given in an\r\namendment to the Spooner Act, which expired by the terms of its own\r\nlimitation some years ago. Since that time the government has continued,\r\nunder the advice of the Attorney General that in the absence of action by\r\nCongress, there is necessarily an implied authority on the part of the\r\nExecutive to maintain a government in a territory in which he has to see\r\nthat the laws are executed. The fact that we have been able thus to get\r\nalong during the important days of construction without legislation\r\nexpressly formulating the government of the zone, or delegating the\r\ncreation of it to the President, is not a reason for supposing that we may\r\ncontinue the same kind of a government after the construction is finished.\r\nThe implied authority of the President to maintain a civil government in\r\nthe zone may be derived from the mandatory direction given him in the\r\noriginal Spooner Act, by which he was commanded to build the canal; but\r\ncertainly, now that the canal is about to be completed and to be put under\r\na permanent management, there ought to be specific statutory authority for\r\nits regulation and control and for the government of the zone, which we\r\nhold for the chief and main purpose of operating the canal.\r\n\r\nI fully concur with the Secretary of War that the problem is simply the\r\nmanagement of a great public work, and not the government of a local\r\nrepublic; that every provision must be directed toward the successful\r\nmaintenance of the canal as an avenue of commerce, and that all provisions\r\nfor the government of those who live within the zone should be subordinate\r\nto the main purpose.\r\n\r\nThe zone is 40 miles long and 10 miles wide. Now, it has a population Of\r\n50,000 or 60,000, but as soon as the work of construction is completed, the\r\ntowns which make up this population will be deserted, and only\r\ncomparatively few natives will continue their residence there. The control\r\nof them ought to approximate a military government. One judge and two\r\njustices of the peace will be sufficient to attend to all the judicial and\r\nlitigated business there is. With a few fundamental laws of Congress, the\r\nzone should be governed by the orders of the President, issued through the\r\nWar Department, as it is today. Provisions can be made for the guaranties\r\nof life, liberty, and property, but beyond those, the government should be\r\nthat of a military reservation, managed in connection with this great\r\nhighway of trade.\r\n\r\nFURNISHING SUPPLIES AND REPAIRS.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I discussed at length the reasons for the\r\nGovernment's assuming the task of furnishing to all ships that use the\r\ncanal, whether our own naval vessels or others, the supplies of coal and\r\noil and other necessities with which they must be replenished either before\r\nor after passing through the canal, together with the dock facilities and\r\nrepairs of every character. This it is thought wise to do through the\r\nGovernment, because the Government must establish for itself, for its own\r\nnaval vessels, large depots and dry docks and warehouses, and these may\r\neasily be enlarged so as to secure to the world public using the canal\r\nreasonable prices and a certainty that there will be no discrimination\r\nbetween those who wish to avail themselves of such facilities. TOLLS.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation with respect to the tolls of the canal that\r\nwithin limits, which shall seem wise to Congress, the power of fixing tolls\r\nbe given to the President. In order to arrive at a proper conclusion, there\r\nmust be some experimenting, and this can not be done if Congress does not\r\ndelegate the power to one who can act expeditiously.\r\n\r\nPOWER EXISTS TO RELIEVE AMERICAN SHIPPING.\r\n\r\nI am very confident that the United States has the power to relieve from\r\nthe payment of tolls any part of our shipping that Congress deems wise. We\r\nown the canal. It was our money that built it. We have the right to charge\r\ntolls for its use. Those tolls must be the same to everyone; but when we\r\nare dealing with our own ships, the practice of many Governments of\r\nsubsidizing their own merchant vessels is so well established in general\r\nthat a subsidy equal to the tolls, an equivalent remission of tolls, can\r\nnot be held to be a discrimination in the use of the canal. The practice in\r\nthe Suez Canal makes this clear. The experiment in tolls to be made by the\r\nPresident would doubtless disclose how great a burden of tolls the\r\ncoastwise trade between the Atlantic and the Pacific coast could bear\r\nwithout preventing its usefulness in competition with the transcontinental\r\nrailroads. One of the chief reasons for building the canal was to set up\r\nthis competition and to bring the two shores closer together as a practical\r\ntrade problem. It may be that the tolls will have to be wholly remitted. I\r\ndo not think this is the best principle, because I believe that the cost of\r\nsuch a Government work as the Panama Canal ought to be imposed gradually\r\nbut certainly upon the trade which it creates and makes possible. So far as\r\nwe can, consistent with the development of the world's trade through the\r\ncanal, and the benefit which it was intended to secure to the east and west\r\ncoastwise trade, we ought to labor to secure from the canal tolls a\r\nsufficient amount ultimately to meet the debt which we have assumed and to\r\npay the interest.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the Philippines, I urgently join in the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of War that the act of February 6, 1905, limiting the\r\nindebtedness that may be incurred by the Philippine Government for the\r\nconstruction of public works, be increased from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000.\r\nThe finances of that Government are in excellent condition. The maximum sum\r\nmentioned is quite low as compared with the amount of indebtedness of other\r\ngovernments with similar resources, and the success which has attended the\r\nexpenditure of the $5,000,000 in the useful improvements of the harbors and\r\nother places in the Islands justifies and requires additional expenditures\r\nfor like purposes. NATURALIZATION.\r\n\r\nI also join in the recommendation that the legislature of the Philippine\r\nIslands be authorized to provide for the naturalization of Filipinos and\r\nothers who by the present law are treated as aliens, so as to enable them\r\nto become citizens of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nFRIARS' LANDS.\r\n\r\nPending an investigation by Congress at its last session, through one of\r\nits committees, into the disposition of the friars' lands, Secretary\r\nDickinson directed that the friars' lands should not be sold in excess of\r\nthe limits fixed for the public lands until Congress should pass upon the\r\nsubject or should have concluded its investigation. This order has been an\r\nobstruction to the disposition of the lands, and I expect to direct the\r\nSecretary of War to return to the practice under the opinion of the\r\nAttorney General which will enable us to dispose of the lands much more\r\npromptly, and to prepare a sinking fund with which to meet the $7,000,000\r\nof bonds issued for the purchase of the lands. I have no doubt whatever\r\nthat the Attorney General's construction was a proper one, and that it is\r\nin the interest of everyone that the land shall be promptly disposed of.\r\nThe danger of creating a monopoly of ownership in lands under the statutes\r\nas construed is nothing. There are only two tracts of 60,000 acres each\r\nunimproved and in remote Provinces that are likely to be disposed of in\r\nbulk, and the rest of the lands are subject to the limitation that they\r\nshall be first offered to the present tenants and lessors who hold them in\r\nsmall tracts.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND HARBORS.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the river and harbor improvements reach $32,000,000 for\r\nthe coming year. I wish to urge that whenever a project has been adopted by\r\nCongress as one to be completed, the more money which can be economically\r\nexpended in its construction in each year, the greater the ultimate\r\neconomy. This has especial application to the improvement of the\r\nMississippi River and its large branches. It seems to me that an increase\r\nin the amount of money now being annually expended in the improvement of\r\nthe Ohio River which has been formally adopted by Congress would be in the\r\ninterest of the public. A similar change ought to be made during the\r\npresent Congress, in the amount to be appropriated for the Missouri River.\r\nThe engineers say that the cost of the improvement of the Missouri River\r\nfrom Kansas City to St. Louis, in order to secure 6 feet as a permanent\r\nchannel, will reach $20,000,000. There have been at least three\r\nrecommendations from the Chief of Engineers that if the improvement be\r\nadopted, $2,000,000 should be expended upon it annually. This particular\r\nimprovement is especially entitled to the attention of Congress, because a\r\ncompany has been organized in Kansas City, with a capital of $1,000,000,\r\nwhich has built steamers and barges, and is actually using the river for\r\ntransportation in order to show what can be done in the way of affecting\r\nrates between Kansas City and St. Louis, and in order to manifest their\r\ngood faith and confidence in respect of the improvement. I urgently\r\nrecommend that the appropriation for this improvement be increased from\r\n$600,000, as recommended now in the completion of a contract, to $2,000,000\r\nannually, so that the work may be done in 10 years.\r\n\r\nWATERWAY FROM THE LAKES TO THE GULF.\r\n\r\nThe project for a navigable waterway from Lake Michigan to the mouth of the\r\nIllinois River, and thence via the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, is\r\none of national importance. In view of the work already accomplished by the\r\nSanitary District of Chicago, an agency of the State of Illinois, which has\r\nconstructed the most difficult and costly stretch of this waterway and made\r\nit an asset of the Nation, and in view of the fact that the people of\r\nIllinois have authorized the expenditure Of $20,000,000 to carry this\r\nwaterway 62 miles farther to Utica, I feel that it is fitting that this\r\nwork should be supplemented by the Government, and that the expenditures\r\nrecommended by the special board of engineers on the waterway from Utica to\r\nthe mouth of the Illinois River be made upon lines which while providing a\r\nwaterway for the Nation should otherwise benefit that State to the fullest\r\nextent. I recommend that the term of service of said special board of\r\nengineers be continued, and that it be empowered to reopen the question of\r\nthe treatment of the lower Illinois River, and to negotiate with a properly\r\nconstituted commission representing the State of Illinois, and to agree\r\nupon a plan for the improvement of the lower Illinois River and upon the\r\nextent to which the United States may properly cooperate with the State of\r\nIllinois in securing the construction of a navigable waterway from Lockport\r\nto the mouth of the Illinois River in conjunction with the development of\r\nwater power by that State between Lockport and Utica.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nRemoval of clerks of Federal courts.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney General shows that he has subjected to close\r\nexamination the accounts of the clerks of the Federal courts; that he has\r\nfound a good many which disclose irregularities or dishonesty; but that he\r\nhas had considerable difficulty in securing an effective prosecution or\r\nremoval of the clerks thus derelict. I am certainly not unduly prejudiced\r\nagainst the Federal courts, but the fact is that the long and confidential\r\nrelations which grow out of the tenure for life on the part of the judge\r\nand the practical tenure for life on the part of the clerk are not\r\ncalculated to secure the strictness of dealing by the judge with the clerk\r\nin respect to his fees and accounts which assures in the clerk's conduct a\r\nfreedom from overcharges and carelessness. The relationship between the\r\njudge and the clerk makes it ungracious for members of the bar to complain\r\nof the clerk or for department examiners to make charges against him to be\r\nheard by the court, and an order of removal of a clerk and a judgment for\r\nthe recovery of fees are in some cases reluctantly entered by the judge.\r\nFor this reason I recommend an amendment to the law whereby the President\r\nshall be given power to remove the clerks for cause. This provision need\r\nnot interfere with the right of the judge to appoint his clerk or to remove\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFrench spoliation awards.\r\n\r\nIn my last message, I recommended to Congress that it authorize the payment\r\nof the findings or judgments of the Court of Claims in the matter of the\r\nFrench spoliation cases. There has been no appropriation to pay these\r\njudgments since 1905. The findings and awards were obtained after a very\r\nbitter fight, the Government succeeding in about 75 per cent of the cases.\r\nThe amount of the awards ought, as a matter of good faith on the part of\r\nthe Government, to be paid.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYERS' LIABILITY AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the liability of the master to his servant for personal\r\ninjuries to such as are occasioned by his fault has been abandoned in most\r\ncivilized countries and provision made whereby the employee injured in the\r\ncourse of his employment is compensated for his loss of working ability\r\nirrespective of negligence. The principle upon which such provision\r\nproceeds is that accidental injuries to workmen in modern industry, with\r\nits vast complexity and inherent dangers arising from complicated machinery\r\nand the use of the great forces of steam and electricity, should be\r\nregarded as risks of the industry and the loss borne in some equitable\r\nproportion by those who for their own profit engage therein. In recognition\r\nof this the last Congress authorized the appointment of a commission to\r\ninvestigate the subject of employers' liability and workmen's compensation\r\nand to report the result of their investigations, through the President, to\r\nCongress. This commission was appointed and has been at work, holding\r\nhearings, gathering data, and considering the subject, and it is expected\r\nwill be able to report by the first of the year, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the law. It is hoped and expected that the commission will\r\nsuggest legislation which will enable us to put in the place of the present\r\nwasteful and sometimes unjust system of employers' liability a plan of\r\ncompensation which will afford some certain and definite relief to all\r\nemployees who are injured in the course of their employment in those\r\nindustries which are subject to the regulating power of Congress.\r\n\r\nMEASURES TO PREVENT DELAY AND UNNECESSARY COST OF LITIGATION.\r\n\r\nIn promotion of the movement for the prevention of delay and unnecessary\r\ncost, in litigation, I am glad to say that the Supreme Court has taken\r\nsteps to reform the present equity rules of the Federal courts, and that we\r\nmay in the near future expect a revision of them which will be a long step\r\nin the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe American Bar Association has recommended to Congress several bills\r\nexpediting procedure, one of which has already passed the House\r\nunanimously, February 6, 1911. This directs that no judgment should be set\r\naside or reversed, or new trial granted, unless it appears to the court,\r\nafter an examination of the entire cause, that the error complained of has\r\ninjuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties, and also\r\nprovides for the submission of issues of fact to a jury, reserving\r\nquestions of law for subsequent argument and decision. I hope this bill\r\nwill pass the Senate and become law, for it will simplify the procedure at\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAnother bill 11 to amend chapter II of the judicial Code, in order to\r\navoid errors in pleading, was presented by the same association, and one.\r\nenlarging the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court so as to permit that court\r\nto examine, upon a writ of error, all cases in which any right or title is\r\nclaimed under the Constitution, or any statute or treaty of the United\r\nStates, whether the decision in the court below has been against the right\r\nor title or in its favor. Both these measures are in the interest of\r\njustice and should be passed.\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present administration in 1909 the postal service\r\nwas in arrears to the extent Of $17,479,770.47. It was very much the\r\nlargest deficit on record. In the brief space of two years this has been\r\nturned into a surplus Of $220,000, which has been accomplished without\r\ncurtailment of the postal facilities, as may be seen by the fact that there\r\nhave been established 3,744 new post offices; delivery by carrier has been\r\nadded to the service in 186 cities; 2,516 new rural routes have been\r\nestablished, covering 60,000 miles; the force of postal employees has been\r\nincreased in these two years by more than 8,000, and their average annual\r\nsalary has had a substantial increase.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL-SAVINGS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nOn January 3, 1911, postal-savings depositories were established\r\nexperimentally in 48 States and Territories. After three months' successful\r\noperation the system was extended as rapidly as feasible to the 7,500 Post\r\noffices of the first, second, and third classes constituting the\r\npresidential grade. By the end of the year practically all of these will\r\nhave been designated and then the system will be extended to all\r\nfourth-class post offices doing a money-order business.\r\n\r\nIn selecting post offices for depositories consideration was given to the\r\nefficiency of the postmasters and only those offices where the ratings were\r\nsatisfactory to the department have been designated. Withholding\r\ndesignation from postmasters with unsatisfactory ratings has had a salutary\r\neffect on the service.\r\n\r\nThe deposits have kept pace with the extension of the system. Amounting to\r\nonly $60,652 at the end of the first month's operation in the experimental\r\noffices, they increased to $679,310 by July, and now after 11 months of\r\noperation have reached a total of $11,000,000. This sum is distributed\r\namong 2,710 banks and protected tinder the law by bonds deposited with the\r\nTreasurer of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the method adopted for the conduct of the system certificates are\r\nissued as evidence of deposits, and accounts with depositors are kept by\r\nthe post offices instead of by the department. Compared with the practice\r\nin other countries of entering deposits in pass books and keeping at the\r\ncentral office a ledger account with each depositor, the use of the\r\ncertificate has resulted in great economy of administration.\r\n\r\nThe depositors thus far number approximately 150,000. They include 40\r\nnationalities, native Americans largely predominating and English and\r\nItalians coming next.\r\n\r\nThe first conversion of deposits into United States bonds bearing interest\r\nat the rate of 2.5 per cent occurred on July 1, 1911, the amount of\r\ndeposits exchanged being $41,900, or a little more than 6 per cent of the\r\ntotal outstanding certificates of deposit on June 30. Of this issue, bonds\r\nto the value of $6,120 were in coupon form and $35,780 in registered form.\r\n\r\nPARCEL POST.\r\n\r\nSteps should be taken immediately for the establishment of a rural parcel\r\npost. In the estimates of appropriations needed for the maintenance of the\r\npostal service for the ensuing fiscal year an item of $150,000 has been\r\ninserted to cover the preliminary expense of establishing a parcel post on\r\nrural mail routes, as well as to cover an investigation having for its\r\nobject the final establishment of a general parcel post on all railway and\r\nsteamboat transportation routes. The department believes that after the\r\ninitial expenses of establishing the system are defrayed and the parcel\r\npost is in full operation on the rural routes it will not only bring in\r\nsufficient revenue to meet its cost, but also a surplus that can be\r\nutilized in paying the expenses of a parcel post in the City Delivery\r\nService.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that Congress will authorize the immediate establishment of a\r\nlimited parcel post on such rural routes as may be selected, providing for\r\nthe delivery along the routes of parcels not exceeding eleven pounds, which\r\nis the weight limit for the international parcel post, or at the post\r\noffice from which such route emanates, or on another route emanating from\r\nthe same office. Such preliminary service will prepare the way for the more\r\nthorough and comprehensive inquiry contemplated in asking for the\r\nappropriation mentioned, enable the department to gain definite information\r\nconcerning the practical operation of a general system, and at the same\r\ntime extend the benefit of the service to a class of people who, above all\r\nothers, are specially in need of it.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that we have a general parcel post has awakened great\r\nopposition on the part of some who think that it will have the effect to\r\ndestroy the business of the country storekeeper. Instead of doing this, I\r\nthink the change will greatly increase business for the benefit of all. The\r\nreduction in the cost of living it will bring about ought to make its\r\ncoming certain.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of November last, I reviewed the fighting fleet of battleships\r\nand other vessels assembled in New York Harbor, consisting of 24\r\nbattleships, 2 armored cruisers, 2 cruisers, 22 destroyers, 12 torpedo\r\nboats, 8 submarines, and other attendant vessels, making 98 vessels of all\r\nclasses, of a tonnage Of 576,634 tons. Those who saw the fleet were struck\r\nwith its preparedness and with its high military efficiency. All Americans\r\nshould be proud of its personnel.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was deficient in the number of torpedo destroyers, in cruisers,\r\nand in colliers, as well as in large battleship cruisers, which are now\r\nbecoming a very important feature of foreign navies, notably the British,\r\nGerman, and Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe building plan for this year contemplates two battleships and two\r\ncolliers. This is because the other and smaller vessels can be built much\r\nmore rapidly in case of emergency than the battleships, and we certainly\r\nought to continue the policy of two battleships a year until after the\r\nPanama Canal is finished and until in our first line and in our reserve\r\nline we can number 40 available vessels of proper armament and size.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of the Navy and the appointment of four aids to the\r\nSecretary have continued to demonstrate their usefulness. It would be\r\ndifficult now to administer the affairs of the Navy without the expert\r\ncounsel and advice of these aids, and I renew the recommendation which I\r\nmade last year, that the aids be recognized by statute.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the Navy, with its present size, should have admirals in\r\nactive command higher than rear admirals. The recognized grades in order\r\nare: Admiral of the fleet, admiral, vice admiral, and rear admiral. Our\r\ngreat battleship fleet is commanded by a rear admiral, with four other rear\r\nadmirals under his orders. This is not as it should be, and when questions\r\nof precedence arise between our naval officers and those of European\r\nnavies, the American rear admiral, though in command of ten times the force\r\nof a foreign vice admiral, must yield precedence to the latter. Such an\r\nabsurdity ought not to prevail, and it can be avoided by the creation of\r\ntwo or three positions of flag rank above that of rear admiral.\r\n\r\nI attended the opening of the new training school at North Chicago, Ill.,\r\nand am glad to note the opportunity which this gives for drawing upon young\r\nmen of the country from the interior, from farms, stores, shops, and\r\noffices, which insures a high average of intelligence and character among\r\nthem, and which they showed in the very wonderful improvement in discipline\r\nand drill which only a few short weeks' presence at the naval station had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the consideration of the new system of detention\r\nand of punishment for Army and Navy enlisted men which has obtained in\r\nGreat Britain, and which has made greatly for the better control of the.\r\nmen. We should adopt a similar system here.\r\n\r\nLike the Treasury Department and the War Department, the Navy Department\r\nhas given much attention to economy in administration, and has cut down a\r\nnumber of unnecessary expenses and reduced its estimates except for\r\nconstruction and the increase that that involves.\r\n\r\nI urge upon Congress the necessity for an immediate increase of 2,000 men\r\nin the enlisted strength of the Navy, provided for in the estimates. Four\r\nthousand more are now needed to man all the available vessels.\r\n\r\nThere are in the service to-day about 47,750 enlisted men of all ratings.\r\n\r\nCareful computation shows that in April, 1912, 49,166 men will be required\r\nfor vessels in commission, and 3,000 apprentice seamen should be kept under\r\ntraining at all times.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF NAVY YARDS.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy has recommended the abolition of certain of the\r\nsmaller and unnecessary navy yards, and in order to furnish a complete and\r\ncomprehensive report has referred the question of all navy yards to the\r\njoint board of the Army and Navy. This board will shortly make its report\r\nand the Secretary of the Navy advises me that his recommendations on the\r\nsubject will be presented early in the coming year. The measure of economy\r\ncontained in a proper handling of this subject is so great and so important\r\nto the interests of the Nation that I shall present it to Congress as a\r\nseparate subject apart from my annual message. Concentration of the\r\nnecessary work for naval vessels in a few navy yards on each coast is a\r\nvital necessity if proper economy in Government expenditures is to be\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nAMALGAMATION OF STAFF CORPS IN THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy is striving to unify the various corps of the\r\nNavy to the extent possible and thereby stimulate a Navy spirit as\r\ndistinguished from a corps spirit. In this he has my warm support.\r\n\r\nAll officers are to be naval officers first and specialists afterwards.\r\nThis means that officers will take up at least one specialty, such as\r\nordnance, construction, or engineering. This is practically what is done\r\nnow, only some of the specialists, like the pay officers and naval\r\nconstructors, are not of the line. It is proposed to make them all of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nAll combatant corps should obviously be of the line. This necessitates\r\namalgamating the pay officers and also those engaged in the technical work\r\nof producing the finished ship. This is at present the case with the single\r\nexception of the naval constructors, whom it is now proposed to amalgamate\r\nwith the line.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nI urge again upon Congress the desirability of establishing the council of\r\nnational defense. The bill to establish this council was before Congress\r\nlast winter, and it is hoped that this legislation will pass during the\r\npresent session. The purpose of the council is to determine the general\r\npolicy of national defense and to recommend to Congress and to the\r\nPresident such measures relating to it as it shall deem necessary and\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nNo such machinery is now provided by which the readiness of the Army and\r\nNavy may be improved and the programs of military and naval requirements\r\nshall be coordinated and properly scrutinized with a view of the\r\nnecessities of the whole Nation rather than of separate departments.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE AND LABOR.\r\n\r\nFor the consideration of matters which are pending or have been disposed of\r\nin the Agricultural Department and in the Department of Commerce and Labor,\r\nI refer to the very excellent reports of the Secretaries of those\r\ndepartments. I shall not be able to submit to Congress until after the\r\nChristmas holidays the question of conservation of our resources arising in\r\nAlaska and the West and the question of the rate for second-class mail\r\nmatter in the Post Office Department.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION ON EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe law does not require the submission of the reports of the Commission on\r\nEconomy and Efficiency until the 31st of December. I shall therefore not be\r\nable to submit a report of the work of that commission until the assembling\r\nof Congress after the holidays.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RETIREMENT AND CONTRIBUTORY PENSION SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nI have already advocated, in my last annual message, the adoption of a\r\ncivil-service retirement system, with a contributory feature to it so as to\r\nreduce to a minimum the cost to the Government of the pensions to be paid.\r\nAfter considerable reflection, I am very much opposed to a pension system\r\nthat involves no contribution from the employees. I think the experience of\r\nother governments justifies this view; but the crying necessity for some\r\nsuch contributory system, with possibly a preliminary governmental outlay,\r\nin order to cover the initial cost and to set the system going at once\r\nwhile the contributions are accumulating, is manifest on every side.\r\nNothing will so much promote the economy and efficiency of the Government\r\nas such a system.\r\n\r\nELIMINATION OF ALL LOCAL OFFICES FROM POLITICS.\r\n\r\nI wish to renew again my recommendation that all the local offices\r\nthroughout the country, including collectors of internal revenue,\r\ncollectors of customs, postmasters of all four classes, immigration\r\ncommissioners and marshals, should be by law covered into the classified\r\nservice, the necessity for confirmation by the Senate be removed, and the\r\nPresident and the others, whose time is now taken up in distributing this\r\npatronage under the custom that has prevailed since the beginning of the\r\nGovernment in accordance with the recommendation of the Senators and\r\nCongressmen of the majority party, should be relieved from this burden. I\r\nam confident that such a change would greatly reduce the cost of\r\nadministering the Government, and that it would add greatly to its\r\nefficiency. It would take away the power to use the patronage of the\r\nGovernment for political purposes. When officers are recommended by\r\nSenators and Congressmen from political motives and for political services\r\nrendered, it is impossible to expect that while in office the appointees\r\nwill not regard their tenure as more or less dependent upon continued\r\npolitical service for their patrons, and no regulations, however stiff or\r\nrigid, will prevent this, because such regulations, in view of the method\r\nand motive for selection, are plainly inconsistent and deemed hardly worthy\r\nof respect.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam H. Taft\r\nDecember 3, 1912\r\n\r\nJump to Part II | Part III\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe foreign relations of the United States actually and potentially affect\r\nthe state of the Union to a degree not widely realized and hardly surpassed\r\nby any other factor in the welfare of the whole Nation. The position of the\r\nUnited States in the moral, intellectual, and material relations of the\r\nfamily of nations should be a matter of vital interest to every patriotic\r\ncitizen. The national prosperity and power impose upon us duties which we\r\ncan not shirk if we are to be true to our ideals. The tremendous growth of\r\nthe export trade of the United States has already made that trade a very\r\nreal factor in the industrial and commercial prosperity of the country.\r\nWith the development of our industries the foreign commerce of the United\r\nStates must rapidly become a still more essential factor in its economic\r\nwelfare. Whether we have a farseeing and wise diplomacy and are not\r\nrecklessly plunged into unnecessary wars, and whether our foreign policies\r\nare based upon an intelligent grasp of present-day world conditions and a\r\nclear view of the potentialities of the future, or are governed by a\r\ntemporary and timid expediency or by narrow views befitting an infant\r\nnation, are questions in the alternative consideration of which must\r\nconvince any thoughtful citizen that no department of national polity\r\noffers greater opportunity for promoting the interests of the whole people\r\non the one hand, or greater chance on the other of permanent national\r\ninjury, than that which deals with the foreign relations of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental foreign policies of the United States should be raised high\r\nabove the conflict of partisanship and wholly dissociated from differences\r\nas to domestic policy. In its foreign affairs the United States should\r\npresent to the world a united front. The intellectual, financial, and\r\nindustrial interests of the country and the publicist, the wage earner, the\r\nfarmer, and citizen of whatever occupation must cooperate in a spirit of\r\nhigh patriotism to promote that national solidarity which is indispensable\r\nto national efficiency and to the attainment of national ideals.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with all foreign powers remain upon a\r\nsound basis of peace, harmony, and friendship. A greater insistence upon\r\njustice to American citizens or interests wherever it may have been denied\r\nand a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other\r\nrelations have only served to strengthen our friendships with foreign\r\ncountries by placing those friendships upon a firm foundation of realities\r\nas well as aspirations.\r\n\r\nBefore briefly reviewing the more important events of the last year in our\r\nforeign relations, which it is my duty to do as charged with their conduct\r\nand because diplomatic affairs are not of a nature to make it appropriate\r\nthat the Secretary of State make a formal annual report, I desire to touch\r\nupon some of the essentials to the safe management of the foreign relations\r\nof the United States and to endeavor, also, to define clearly certain\r\nconcrete policies which are the logical modern corollaries of the\r\nundisputed and traditional fundamentals of the foreign policy of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present administration the United States, having\r\nfully entered upon its position as a world power, with the responsibilities\r\nthrust upon it by the results of the Spanish-American War, and already\r\nengaged in laying the groundwork of a vast foreign trade upon which it\r\nshould one day become more and more dependent, found itself without the\r\nmachinery for giving thorough attention to, and taking effective action\r\nupon, a mass of intricate business vital to American interests in every\r\ncountry in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State was an archaic and inadequate machine lacking most\r\nof the attributes of the foreign office of any great modern power. With an\r\nappropriation made upon my recommendation by the Congress on August 5,\r\n1909, the Department of State was completely reorganized. There were\r\ncreated Divisions of Latin American Affairs and of Far Eastern, Near\r\nEastern, and Western European Affairs. To these divisions were called from\r\nthe foreign service diplomatic and consular officers possessing experience\r\nand knowledge gained by actual service in different parts of the world and\r\nthus familiar with political and commercial conditions in the regions\r\nconcerned. The work was highly specialized. The result is that where\r\npreviously this Government from time to time would emphasize in its foreign\r\nrelations one or another policy, now American interests in every quarter of\r\nthe globe are being cultivated with equal assiduity. This principle of\r\npolitico-geographical division possesses also the good feature of making\r\npossible rotation between the officers of the departmental, the diplomatic,\r\nand the consular branches of the foreign service, and thus keeps the whole\r\ndiplomatic and consular establishments tinder the Department of State in\r\nclose touch and equally inspired with the aims and policy of the\r\nGovernment. Through the newly created Division of Information the foreign\r\nservice is kept fully informed of what transpires from day to day in the\r\ninternational relations of the country, and contemporary foreign comment\r\naffecting American interests is promptly brought to the attention of the\r\ndepartment. The law offices of the department were greatly strengthened.\r\nThere were added foreign trade advisers to cooperate with the diplomatic and\r\nconsular bureaus and the politico-geographical divisions in the innumerable\r\nmatters where commercial diplomacy or consular work calls for such special\r\nknowledge. The same officers, together with the rest of the new\r\norganization, are able at all times to give to American citizens accurate\r\ninformation as to conditions in foreign countries with which they have\r\nbusiness and likewise to cooperate more effectively with the Congress and\r\nalso with the other executive departments.\r\n\r\nMERIT SYSTEM IN CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC CORPS\r\n\r\nExpert knowledge and professional training must evidently be the essence of\r\nthis reorganization. Without a trained foreign service there would not be\r\nmen available for the work in the reorganized Department of State.\r\nPresident Cleveland had taken the first step toward introducing the merit\r\nsystem in the foreign service. That had been followed by the application of\r\nthe merit principle, with excellent results, to the entire consular branch.\r\nAlmost nothing, however, had been done in this direction with regard to the\r\nDiplomatic Service. In this age of commercial diplomacy it was evidently of\r\nthe first importance to train an adequate personnel in that branch of the\r\nservice. Therefore, on November 26, 1909, by an Executive order I placed\r\nthe Diplomatic Service up to the grade of secretary of embassy, inclusive,\r\nupon exactly the same strict nonpartisan basis of the merit system, rigid\r\nexamination for appointment and promotion only for efficiency, as had been\r\nmaintained without exception in the Consular Service.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS AS TO MERIT AND NONPARTISAN CHARACTER OF APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\nHow faithful to the merit system and how nonpartisan has been the conduct\r\nof the Diplomatic and Consular Services in the last four years may be\r\njudged from the following: Three ambassadors now serving held their present\r\nrank at the beginning of my administration. Of the ten ambassadors whom I\r\nhave appointed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister. Nine\r\nministers now serving held their present rank at the beginning of my\r\nadministration. Of the thirty ministers whom I have appointed, eleven were\r\npromoted from the lower grades of the foreign service or from the\r\nDepartment of State. Of the nineteen missions in Latin America, where our\r\nrelations are close and our interest is great, fifteen chiefs of mission\r\nare service men, three having entered the service during this\r\nadministration. Thirty-seven secretaries of embassy or legation who have\r\nreceived their initial appointments after passing successfully the required\r\nexamination were chosen for ascertained fitness, without regard to\r\npolitical affiliations. A dearth of candidates from Southern and Western\r\nStates has alone made it impossible thus far completely to equalize all the\r\nStates' representations in the foreign service. In the effort to equalize\r\nthe representation of the various States in the Consular Service I have\r\nmade sixteen of the twenty-nine new appointments as consul which have\r\noccurred during my administration from the Southern States. This is 55 per\r\ncent. Every other consular appointment made, including the promotion of\r\neleven young men from the consular assistant and student interpreter corps,\r\nhas been by promotion or transfer, based solely upon efficiency shown in\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure to the business and other interests of the United States\r\na continuance of the resulting benefits of this reform, I earnestly renew\r\nmy previous recommendations of legislation making it permanent along some\r\nsuch lines as those of the measure now Pending in Congress.\r\n\r\nLARGER PROVISION FOR EMBASSIES AND LEGATIONS AND FOR OTHER EXPENSES OF OUR\r\nFOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\nIn connection with legislation for the amelioration of the foreign service,\r\nI wish to invite attention to the advisability of placing the salary\r\nappropriations upon a better basis. I believe that the best results would\r\nbe obtained by a moderate scale of salaries, with adequate funds for the\r\nexpense of proper representation, based in each case upon the scale and\r\ncost of living at each post, controlled by a system of accounting, and\r\nunder the general direction of the Department of State.\r\n\r\nIn line with the object which I have sought of placing our foreign service\r\non a basis of permanency, I have at various times advocated provision by\r\nCongress for the acquisition of Government-owned buildings for the\r\nresidence and offices of our diplomatic officers, so as to place them more\r\nnearly on an equality with similar officers of other nations and to do away\r\nwith the discrimination which otherwise must necessarily be made, in some\r\ncases, in favor of men having large private fortunes. The act of Congress\r\nwhich I approved on February 17, 1911, was a right step in this direction.\r\nThe Secretary of State has already made the limited recommendations\r\npermitted by the act for any one year, and it is my hope that the bill\r\nintroduced in the House of Representatives to carry out these\r\nrecommendations will be favorably acted on by the Congress during its\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin-American countries the expense of government-owned legations\r\nwill be less than elsewhere, and it is certainly very urgent that in such\r\ncountries as some of the Republics of Central America and the Caribbean,\r\nwhere it is peculiarly difficult to rent suitable quarters, the\r\nrepresentatives of the United States should be justly and adequately\r\nprovided with dignified and suitable official residences. Indeed, it is\r\nhigh time that the dignity and power of this great Nation should be\r\nfittingly signalized by proper buildings for the occupancy of the Nation's\r\nrepresentatives everywhere abroad.\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY A HAND MAID OF COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND PEACE\r\n\r\nThe diplomacy of the present administration has sought to respond to modern\r\nideas of commercial intercourse. This policy has been characterized as\r\nsubstituting dollars for bullets. It is one that appeals alike to\r\nidealistic humanitarian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and\r\nstrategy, and to legitimate commercial aims. It I is an effort frankly\r\ndirected to the increase of American trade upon the axiomatic principle\r\nthat the Government of the United States shall extend all proper support to\r\nevery legitimate and beneficial American enterprise abroad. How great have\r\nbeen the results of this diplomacy, coupled with the maximum and minimum\r\nprovision of the tariff law, will be seen by some consideration of the\r\nwonderful increase in the export trade of the United States. Because\r\nmodern diplomacy is commercial, there has been a disposition in some\r\nquarters to attribute to it none but materialistic aims. How strikingly\r\nerroneous is such an impression may be seen from a study of the results by\r\nwhich the diplomacy of the United States can be judged.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS IN PROMOTION OF PEACE\r\n\r\nIn the field of work toward the ideals of peace this Government negotiated,\r\nbut to my regret was unable to consummate, two arbitration treaties which\r\nset the highest mark of the aspiration of nations toward the substitution\r\nof arbitration and reason for war in the settlement of international\r\ndisputes. Through the efforts of American diplomacy several wars have been\r\nprevented or ended. I refer to the successful tripartite mediation of the\r\nArgentine Republic, Brazil, and the United States between Peru and Ecuador;\r\nthe bringing of the boundary dispute between Panama and Costa Rica to\r\npeaceful arbitration; the staying of warlike preparations when Haiti and\r\nthe Dominican Republic were on the verge of hostilities; the stopping of a\r\nwar in Nicaragua; the halting of internecine strife in Honduras. The\r\nGovernment of the United States was thanked for its influence toward the\r\nrestoration of amicable relations between the Argentine Republic and\r\nBolivia. The diplomacy of the United States is active in seeking to assuage\r\nthe remaining ill-feeling between this country and the Republic of\r\nColombia. In the recent civil war in China the United States successfully\r\njoined with the other interested powers in urging an early cessation of\r\nhostilities. An agreement has been reached between the Governments of Chile\r\nand Peru whereby the celebrated Tacna-Arica dispute, which has so long\r\nembittered international relations on the west coast of South America, has\r\nat last been adjusted. Simultaneously came the news that the boundary\r\ndispute between Peru and Ecuador had entered upon a stage of amicable\r\nsettlement. The position of the United States in reference to the\r\nTacna-Arica dispute between Chile and Peru has been one of nonintervention,\r\nbut one of friendly influence and pacific counsel throughout the period\r\nduring which the dispute in question has been the subject of interchange of\r\nviews between this Government and the two Governments immediately\r\nconcerned. In the general easing of international tension on the west coast\r\nof South America the tripartite mediation, to which I have referred, has\r\nbeen a most potent and beneficent factor.\r\n\r\nCHINA\r\n\r\nIn China the policy of encouraging financial investment to enable that\r\ncountry to help itself has had the result of giving new life and practical\r\napplication to the open-door policy. The consistent purpose of the present\r\nadministration has been to encourage the use of American capital in the\r\ndevelopment of China by the promotion of those essential reforms to which\r\nChina is pledged by treaties with the United States and other powers. The\r\nhypothecation to foreign bankers in connection with certain industrial\r\nenterprises, such as the Hukuang railways, of the national revenues upon\r\nwhich these reforms depended, led the Department of State early in the\r\nadministration to demand for American citizens participation in such\r\nenterprises, in order that the United States might have equal rights and an\r\nequal voice in all questions pertaining to the disposition of the public\r\nrevenues concerned. The same policy of promoting international accord among\r\nthe powers having similar treaty rights as ourselves in the matters of\r\nreform, which could not be put into practical effect without the common\r\nconsent of all, was likewise adopted in the case of the loan desired by\r\nChina for the reform of its currency. The principle of international\r\ncooperation in matters of common interest upon which our policy had already\r\nbeen based in all of the above instances has admittedly been a great factor\r\nin that concert of the powers which has been so happily conspicuous during\r\nthe perilous period of transition through which the great Chinese nation\r\nhas been passing.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA NEEDS OUR HELP IN DEBT ADJUSTMENT\r\n\r\nIn Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras to help themselves. They are the immediate beneficiaries. The\r\nnational benefit to the United States is twofold. First, it is obvious\r\nthat the Monroe doctrine is more vital in the neighborhood of the Panama\r\nCanal and the zone of the Caribbean than anywhere else. There, too, the\r\nmaintenance of that doctrine falls most heavily upon the United States. It\r\nis therefore essential that the countries within that sphere shall be\r\nremoved from the jeopardy involved by heavy foreign debt and chaotic\r\nnational finances and from the ever-present danger of international\r\ncomplications due to disorder at home. Hence the United States has been\r\nglad to encourage and support American bankers who were willing to lend a\r\nhelping hand to the financial rehabilitation of such countries because this\r\nfinancial rehabilitation and the protection of their customhouses from\r\nbeing the prey of would be dictators would remove at one stroke the menace\r\nof foreign creditors and the menace of revolutionary disorder.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage of the United States is one affecting chiefly all the\r\nsouthern and Gulf ports and the business and industry of the South. The\r\nRepublics of Central America and the Caribbean possess great natural\r\nwealth. They need only a measure of stability and the means of financial\r\nregeneration to enter upon an era of peace and prosperity, bringing profit\r\nand happiness to themselves and at the same time creating conditions sure\r\nto lead to a flourishing interchange of trade with this country.\r\n\r\nI wish to call your especial attention to the recent occurrences in\r\nNicaragua, for I believe the terrible events recorded there during the\r\nrevolution of the past summer-the useless loss of life, the devastation of\r\nproperty, the bombardment of defenseless cities, the killing and wounding\r\nof women and children, the torturing of noncombatants to exact\r\ncontributions, and the suffering of thousands of human beings-might have\r\nbeen averted had the Department of State, through approval of the loan\r\nconvention by the Senate, been permitted to carry out its now\r\nwell-developed policy of encouraging the extending of financial aid to weak\r\nCentral American States with the primary objects of avoiding just such\r\nrevolutions by assisting those Republics to rehabilitate their finances, to\r\nestablish their currency on a stable basis, to remove the customhouses from\r\nthe danger of revolutions by arranging for their secure administration, and\r\nto establish reliable banks.\r\n\r\nDuring this last revolution in Nicaragua, the Government of that Republic\r\nhaving admitted its inability to protect American life and property against\r\nacts of sheer lawlessness on the part of the malcontents, and having\r\nrequested this Government to assume that office, it became necessary to\r\nland over 2,000 marines and bluejackets in Nicaragua. Owing to their\r\npresence the constituted Government of Nicaragua was free to devote its\r\nattention wholly to its internal troubles, and was thus enabled to stamp\r\nout the rebellion in a short space of time. When the Red Cross supplies\r\nsent to Granada had been exhausted, 8,000 persons having been given food in\r\none day upon the arrival of the American forces, our men supplied other\r\nunfortunate, needy Nicaraguans from their own haversacks. I wish to\r\ncongratulate the officers and men of the United States navy and Marine\r\nCorps who took part in reestablishing order in Nicaragua upon their\r\nsplendid conduct, and to record with sorrow the death of seven American\r\nmarines and bluejackets. Since the reestablishment of peace and order,\r\nelections have been held amid conditions of quiet and tranquility. Nearly\r\nall the American marines have now been withdrawn. The country should soon\r\nbe on the road to recovery. The only apparent danger now threatening\r\nNicaragua arises from the shortage of funds. Although American bankers have\r\nalready rendered assistance, they may naturally be loath to advance a loan\r\nadequate to set the country upon its feet without the support of some such\r\nconvention as that of June, 1911, upon which the Senate has not yet acted.\r\n\r\nENFORCEMENT OF NEUTRALITY LAWS\r\n\r\nIn the general effort to contribute to the enjoyment of peace by those\r\nRepublics which are near neighbors of the United States, the administration\r\nhas enforced the so-called neutrality statutes with a new vigor, and those\r\nstatutes were greatly strengthened in restricting the exportation of arms\r\nand munitions by the joint resolution of last March. It is still a\r\nregrettable fact that certain American ports are made the rendezvous of\r\nprofessional revolutionists and others engaged in intrigue against the\r\npeace of those Republics. It must be admitted that occasionally a\r\nrevolution in this region is justified as a real popular movement to throw\r\noff the shackles of a vicious and tyrannical government. Such was the\r\nNicaraguan revolution against the Zelaya regime. A nation enjoying our\r\nliberal institutions can not escape sympathy with a true popular movement,\r\nand one so well justified. In very many cases, however, revolutions in the\r\nRepublics in question have no basis in principle, but are due merely to the\r\nmachinations of conscienceless and ambitious men, and have no effect but to\r\nbring new suffering and fresh burdens to an already oppressed people. The\r\nquestion whether the use of American ports as foci of revolutionary\r\nintrigue can be best dealt with by a further amendment to the neutrality\r\nstatutes or whether it would be safer to deal with special cases by special\r\nlaws is one worthy of the careful consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nVISIT OF SECRETARY KNOX TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN\r\n\r\nImpressed with the particular importance of the relations between the\r\nUnited States and the Republics of Central America and the Caribbean\r\nregion, which of necessity must become still more intimate by reason of the\r\nmutual advantages which will be presented by the opening of the Panama\r\nCanal, I directed the Secretary of State last February to visit these\r\nRepublics for the purpose of giving evidence of the sincere friendship and\r\ngood will which the Government and people of the United States bear toward\r\nthem. Ten Republics were visited. Everywhere he was received with a\r\ncordiality of welcome and a generosity of hospitality such as to impress me\r\ndeeply and to merit our warmest thanks. The appreciation of the Governments\r\nand people of the countries visited, which has been appropriately shown in\r\nvarious ways, leaves me no doubt that his visit will conduce to that closer\r\nunion and better understanding between the United States and those\r\nRepublics which I have had it much at heart to promote.\r\n\r\nOUR MEXICAN POLICY\r\n\r\nFor two years revolution and counter-revolution has distraught the\r\nneighboring Republic of Mexico. Brigandage has involved a great deal of\r\ndepredation upon foreign interests. There have constantly recurred\r\nquestions of extreme delicacy. On several occasions very difficult\r\nsituations have arisen on our frontier. Throughout this trying period, the\r\npolicy of the United States has been one of patient nonintervention,\r\nsteadfast recognition of constituted authority in the neighboring nation,\r\nand the exertion of every effort to care for American interests. I\r\nprofoundly hope that the Mexican nation may soon resume the path of order,\r\nprosperity, and progress. To that nation in its sore troubles, the\r\nsympathetic friendship of the United States has been demonstrated to a high\r\ndegree. There were in Mexico at the beginning of the revolution some thirty\r\nor forty thousand American citizens engaged in enterprises contributing\r\ngreatly to the prosperity of that Republic and also benefiting the\r\nimportant trade between the two countries. The investment of American\r\ncapital in Mexico has been estimated at $1,000,000,000. The responsibility\r\nof endeavoring to safeguard those interests and the dangers inseparable\r\nfrom propinquity to so turbulent a situation have been great, but I am\r\nhappy to have been able to adhere to the policy above outlined-a policy\r\nwhich I hope may be soon justified by the complete success of the Mexican\r\npeople in regaining the blessings of peace and good order.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL CREDITS\r\n\r\nA most important work, accomplished in the past year by the American\r\ndiplomatic officers in Europe, is the investigation of the agricultural\r\ncredit system in the European countries. Both as a means to afford relief\r\nto the consumers of this country through a more thorough development of\r\nagricultural resources and as a means of more sufficiently maintaining the\r\nagricultural population, the project to establish credit facilities for the\r\nfarmers is a concern of vital importance to this Nation. No evidence of\r\nprosperity among well-established farmers should blind us to the fact that\r\nlack of capital is preventing a development of the Nation's agricultural\r\nresources and an adequate increase of the land under cultivation; that\r\nagricultural production is fast falling behind the increase in population;\r\nand that, in fact, although these well-established farmers are maintained\r\nin increasing prosperity because of the natural increase in population, we\r\nare not developing the industry of agriculture. We are not breeding in\r\nproportionate numbers a race of independent and independence-loving\r\nlandowners, for a lack of which no growth of cities can compensate. Our\r\nfarmers have been our mainstay in times of crisis, and in future it must\r\nstill largely be upon their stability and common sense that this democracy\r\nmust rely to conserve its principles of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe need of capital which American farmers feel to-day had been experienced\r\nby the farmers of Europe, with their centuries-old farms, many years ago.\r\nThe problem had been successfully solved in the Old World and it was\r\nevident that the farmers of this country might profit by a study of their\r\nsystems. I therefore ordered, through the Department of State, an\r\ninvestigation to be made by the diplomatic officers in Europe, and I have\r\nlaid the results of this investigation before the governors of the various\r\nStates with the hope that they will be used to advantage in their\r\nforthcoming meeting.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF FOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I said that the fiscal year ended June 30, 1911,\r\nwas noteworthy as marking the highest record of exports of American\r\nproducts to foreign countries. The fiscal year 1912 shows that this rate of\r\nadvance has been maintained, the total domestic exports having a valuation\r\napproximately Of $2,200,000,000, as compared with a fraction over\r\n$2,000,000,000 the previous year. It is also significant that manufactured\r\nand partly manufactured articles continue to be the chief commodities\r\nforming the volume of our augmented exports, the demands of our own people\r\nfor consumption requiring that an increasing proportion of our abundant\r\nagricultural products be kept at home. In the fiscal year 1911 the exports\r\nof articles in the various stages of manufacture, not including foodstuffs\r\npartly or wholly manufactured, amounted approximately to $907,500,000. In\r\nthe fiscal year 1912 the total was nearly $1,022,000,000, a gain Of\r\n$114,000,000.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGE OF MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM TARIFF PROVISION\r\n\r\nThe importance which our manufactures have assumed in the commerce of the\r\nworld in competition with the manufactures of other countries again draws\r\nattention to the duty of this Government to use its utmost endeavors to\r\nsecure impartial treatment for American products in all markets. Healthy\r\ncommercial rivalry in international intercourse is best assured by the\r\npossession of proper means for protecting and promoting our foreign trade.\r\nIt is natural that competitive countries should view with some concern this\r\nsteady expansion of our commerce. If in some instance the measures taken by\r\nthem to meet it are not entirely equitable, a remedy should be found. In\r\nformer messages I have described the negotiations of the Department of\r\nState with foreign Governments for the adjustment of the maximum and\r\nminimum tariff as provided in section 2 of the tariff law of 1909. The\r\nadvantages secured by the adjustment of our trade relations under this law\r\nhave continued during the last year, and some additional cases of\r\ndiscriminatory treatment of which we had reason to complain have been\r\nremoved. The Department of State has for the first time in the history of\r\nthis country obtained substantial most-favored-nation treatment from all\r\nthe countries of the world. There are, however, other instances which,\r\nwhile apparently not constituting undue discrimination in the sense of\r\nsection 2, are nevertheless exceptions to the complete equity of tariff\r\ntreatment for American products that the Department of State consistently\r\nhas sought to obtain for American commerce abroad.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY FOR SUPPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThese developments confirm the opinion conveyed to you in my annual message\r\nof 1911, that while the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law of\r\n1909 has been fully justified by the success achieved in removing\r\npreviously existing undue discriminations against American products, yet\r\nexperience has shown that this feature of the law should be amended in such\r\nway as to provide a fully effective means of meeting the varying degrees of\r\ndiscriminatory treatment of American commerce in foreign countries still\r\nencountered, as well as to protect against injurious treatment on the part\r\nof foreign Governments, through either legislative or administrative\r\nmeasures, the financial interests abroad of American citizens whose\r\nenterprises enlarge the market for American commodities.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly recommend to the Congress the passage of some such\r\nenabling measure as the bill which was recommended by the Secretary of\r\nState in his letter of December 13, 1911. The object of the proposed\r\nlegislation is, in brief, to enable the Executive to apply, as the case may\r\nrequire, to any or all commodities, whether or not on the free list from a\r\ncountry which discriminates against the United States, a graduated scale of\r\nduties up to the maximum Of 25 per cent ad valorem provided in the present\r\nlaw. Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no longer accord equal tariff\r\ntreatment to all other nations irrespective of the treatment from them\r\nreceived. Such a flexible power at the command of the Executive would\r\nserve to moderate any unfavorable tendencies on the part of those countries\r\nfrom which the importations into the United States are substantially\r\nconfined to articles on the free list as well as of the countries which\r\nfind a lucrative market in the United States for their products under\r\nexisting customs rates. It is very necessary that the American Government\r\nshould be equipped with weapons of negotiation adapted to modern economic\r\nconditions, in order that we may at all times be in a position to gain not\r\nonly technically just but actually equitable treatment for our trade, and\r\nalso for American enterprise and vested interests abroad.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS SECURED TO OUR COUNTRY BY DIRECT OFFICIAL EFFORT\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the commercial benefits of the Nation derived from the new\r\ndiplomacy and its effectiveness upon the material as well as the more ideal\r\nside, it may be remarked that through direct official efforts alone there\r\nhave been obtained in the course of this administration, contracts from\r\nforeign Governments involving an expenditure of $50,000,000 in the\r\nfactories of the United States. Consideration of this fact and some\r\nreflection upon the necessary effects of a scientific tariff system and a\r\nforeign service alert and equipped to cooperate with the business men of\r\nAmerica carry the conviction that the gratifying increase in the export\r\ntrade of this country is, in substantial amount, due to our improved\r\ngovernmental methods of protecting and stimulating it. It is germane to\r\nthese observations to remark that in the two years that have elapsed since\r\nthe successful negotiation of our new treaty with Japan, which at the time\r\nseemed to present so many practical difficulties, our export trade to that\r\ncountry has increased at the rate of over $1,000,000 a month. Our exports\r\nto Japan for the year ended June 30, 1910, were $21,959,310, while for the\r\nyear ended June 30, 1912, the exports were $53,478,046, a net increase in\r\nthe sale of American products of nearly 150 per cent.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL CLAIMS ARBITRATION WITH GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\nUnder the special agreement entered into between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain on August 18, 1910, for the arbitration of outstanding\r\npecuniary claims, a schedule of claims and the terms of submission have\r\nbeen agreed upon by the two Governments, and together with the special\r\nagreement were approved by the Senate on July 19, 1911, but in accordance\r\nwith the terms of the agreement they did not go into effect until confirmed\r\nby the two Governments by an exchange of notes, which was done on April 26\r\nlast. Negotiations, are still in progress for a supplemental schedule of\r\nclaims to be submitted to arbitration under this agreement, and meanwhile\r\nthe necessary preparations for the arbitration of the claims included in\r\nthe first schedule have been undertaken and are being carried on under the\r\nauthority of an appropriation made for that purpose at the last session of\r\nCongress. It is anticipated that the two Governments will be prepared to\r\ncall upon the arbitration tribunal, established under this agreement, to\r\nmeet at Washington early next year to proceed with this arbitration.\r\n\r\nFUR SEAL TREATY AND NEED FOR AMENDMENT OF OUR STATUTE\r\n\r\nThe act adopted at the last session of Congress to give effect to the\r\nfur-seal convention Of July 7, 1911, between Great Britain, Japan, Russia,\r\nand the United States provided for the suspension of all land killing of\r\nseals on the Pribilof Islands for a period of five years, and an objection\r\nhas now been presented to this provision by the other parties in interest,\r\nwhich raises the issue as to whether or not this prohibition of land\r\nkilling is inconsistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of the treaty\r\nstipulations. The justification of establishing this close season depends,\r\nunder the terms of the convention, upon how far, if at all, it is necessary\r\nfor protecting and preserving the American fur-seal herd and for increasing\r\nits number. This is a question requiring examination of the present\r\ncondition of the herd and the treatment which it needs in the light of\r\nactual experience and scientific investigation. A careful examination of\r\nthe subject is now being made, and this Government will soon be in\r\npossession of a considerable amount of new information about the American\r\nseal herd, which has been secured during the past season and will be of\r\ngreat value in determining this question; and if it should appear that\r\nthere is any uncertainty as to the real necessity for imposing a close\r\nseason at this time I shall take an early opportunity to address a special\r\nmessage to Congress on this subject, in the belief that this Government\r\nshould yield on this point rather than give the slightest ground for the\r\ncharge that we have been in any way remiss in observing our treaty\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nFINAL SETTLEMENT OF NORTH ATLANTIC FISHERIES DISPUTE\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July last an agreement was concluded between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain adopting, with certain modifications, the rules\r\nand method of procedure recommended in the award rendered by the North\r\nAtlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration Tribunal on September 7, 1910, for the\r\nsettlement hereafter, in accordance with the principles laid down in the\r\naward, of questions arising with reference to the exercise of the American\r\nfishing liberties under Article I of the treaty of October 20, 1818,\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain. This agreement received the\r\napproval of the Senate on August I and was formally ratified by the two\r\nGovernments on November 15 last. The rules and a method of procedure\r\nembodied in the award provided for determining by an impartial tribunal the\r\nreasonableness of any new fishery regulations on the treaty coasts of\r\nNewfoundland and Canada before such regulations could be enforced against\r\nAmerican fishermen exercising their treaty liberties on those coasts, and\r\nalso for determining the delimitation of bays on such coasts more than 10\r\nmiles wide, in accordance with the definition adopted by the tribunal of\r\nthe meaning of the word \"bays\" as used in the treaty. In the subsequent\r\nnegotiations between the two Governments, undertaken for the purpose of\r\ngiving practical effect to these rules and methods of procedure, it was\r\nfound that certain modifications therein were desirable from the point of\r\nview of both Governments, and these negotiations have finally resulted in\r\nthe agreement above mentioned by which the award recommendations as\r\nmodified by mutual consent of the two Governments are finally adopted and\r\nmade effective, thus bringing this century-old controversy to a final\r\nconclusion, which is equally beneficial and satisfactory to both\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL VALLEY AND MEXICO\r\n\r\nIn order to make possible the more effective performance of the work\r\nnecessary for the confinement in their present channel of the waters of the\r\nlower Colorado River, and thus to protect the people of the Imperial\r\nValley, as well as in order to reach with the Government of Mexico an\r\nunderstanding regarding the distribution of the waters of the Colorado\r\nRiver, in which both Governments are much interested, negotiations are\r\ngoing forward with a view to the establishment of a preliminary Colorado\r\nRiver commission, which shall have the powers necessary to enable it to do\r\nthe needful work and with authority to study the question of the equitable\r\ndistribution of the waters. There is every reason to believe that an\r\nunderstanding upon this point will be reached and that an agreement will be\r\nsigned in the near future.\r\n\r\nCHAMIZAL DISPUTE\r\n\r\nIn the interest of the people and city of El Paso this Government has been\r\nassiduous in its efforts to bring to an early settlement the long-standing\r\nChamizal dispute with Mexico. Much has been accomplished, and while the\r\nfinal solution of the dispute is not immediate, the favorable attitude\r\nlately assumed by the Mexican Government encourages the hope that this\r\ntroublesome question will be satisfactorily and definitively settled at an\r\nearly day.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the convention of August 23, 1906, signed at the Third Pan\r\nAmerican Conference, held at Rio de Janeiro, the International Commission\r\nof jurists met at that capital during the month of last June. At this\r\nmeeting 16 American Republics were represented, including the United\r\nStates, and comprehensive plans for the future work of the commission were\r\nadopted. At the next meeting fixed for June, 1914, committees already\r\nappointed are instructed to I report regarding topics assigned to them.\r\n\r\nOPIUM CONFERENCE-UNFORTUNATE FAILURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO ENACT RECOMMENDED\r\nLEGISLATION\r\n\r\nIn my message on foreign relations communicated to the two Houses of\r\nCongress December 7, 1911, I called especial attention to the assembling of\r\nthe Opium Conference at The Hague, to the fact that that conference was to\r\nreview all pertinent municipal laws relating to the opium and allied evils,\r\nand certainly all international rules regarding these evils, and to the\r\n-fact that it seemed to me most essential that the Congress should take\r\nimmediate action on the anti-narcotic legislation before the Congress, to\r\nwhich I had previously called attention by a special message.\r\n\r\nThe international convention adopted by the conference conforms almost\r\nentirely to the principles contained in the proposed anti-narcotic\r\nlegislation which has been before the last two Congresses. It was most\r\nunfortunate that this Government, having taken the initiative in the\r\ninternational action which eventuated in the important international opium\r\nconvention, failed to do its share in the great work by neglecting to pass\r\nthe necessary legislation to correct the deplorable narcotic evils in the\r\nUnited States as well as to redeem international pledges upon which it\r\nentered by virtue of the above-mentioned convention. The Congress at its\r\npresent session should enact into law those bills now before it which have\r\nbeen so carefully drawn up in collaboration between the Department of State\r\nand the other executive departments, and which have behind them not only\r\nthe moral sentiment of the country, but the practical support of all the\r\nlegitimate trade interests likely to be affected. Since the international\r\nconvention was signed, adherence to it has been made by several European\r\nStates not represented at the conference at The Hague and also by seventeen\r\nLatin-American Republics.\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND THE NEAR EAST\r\n\r\nThe war between Italy and Turkey came to a close in October last by the\r\nsignature of a treaty of peace, subsequently to which the Ottoman Empire\r\nrenounced sovereignty over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania in favor of Italy.\r\nDuring the past year the Near East has unfortunately been the theater of\r\nconstant hostilities. Almost simultaneously with the conclusion of peace\r\nbetween Italy and Turkey and their arrival at an adjustment of the complex\r\nquestions at issue between them, war broke out between Turkey on the one\r\nhand and Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, and Servia on the other. The United\r\nStates has happily been involved neither directly nor indirectly with the\r\ncauses or questions incident to any of these hostilities and has maintained\r\nin regard to them an attitude of absolute neutrality and of complete\r\npolitical disinterestedness. In the second war in which the Ottoman Empire\r\nhas been engaged the loss of life and the consequent distress on both sides\r\nhave been appalling, and the United States has found occasion, in the\r\ninterest of humanity, to carry out the charitable desires of the American\r\npeople, to extend a measure of relief to the sufferers on either side\r\nthrough the impartial medium of the Red Cross. Beyond this the chief care\r\nof the Government of the United States has been to make due provision for\r\nthe protection of its national resident in belligerent territory. In the\r\nexercise of my duty in this matter I have dispatched to Turkish waters a\r\nspecial-service squadron, consisting of two armored cruisers, in order that\r\nthis Government may if need be bear its part in such measures as it may be\r\nnecessary for the interested nations to adopt for the safeguarding of\r\nforeign lives and property in the Ottoman Empire in the event that a\r\ndangerous situation should develop. In the meanwhile the several interested\r\nEuropean powers have promised to extend to American citizens the benefit of\r\nsuch precautionary or protective measures as they might adopt, in the same\r\nmanner in which it has been the practice of this Government to extend its\r\nprotection to all foreign residents in those countries of the Western\r\nHemisphere in which it has from time to time been the task of the United\r\nStates to act in the interest of peace and good order. The early appearance\r\nof a large fleet of European warships in the Bosphorus apparently assured\r\nthe protection of foreigners in that quarter, where the presence of the\r\nAmerican stationnaire the U. S. S. Scorpion sufficed, tinder the\r\ncircumstances, to represent the United States. Our cruisers were thus left\r\nfree to act if need be along the Mediterranean coasts should any unexpected\r\ncontingency arise affecting the numerous American interests in the\r\nneighborhood of Smyrna and Beirut.\r\n\r\nSPITZBERGEN\r\n\r\nThe great preponderance of American material interests in the sub-arctic\r\nisland of Spitzbergen, which has always been regarded politically as \"no\r\nman's land,\" impels this Government to a continued and lively interest in\r\nthe international dispositions to be made for the political governance and\r\nadministration of that region. The conflict of certain claims of American\r\ncitizens and others is in a fair way to adjustment, while the settlement of\r\nmatters of administration, whether by international conference of the\r\ninterested powers or otherwise, continues to be the subject of exchange of\r\nviews between the Governments concerned.\r\n\r\nLIBERIA\r\n\r\nAs a result of the efforts of this Government to place the Government of\r\nLiberia in position to pay its outstanding indebtedness and to maintain a\r\nstable and efficient government, negotiations for a loan of $1,700,000 have\r\nbeen successfully concluded, and it is anticipated that the payment of the\r\nold loan and the issuance of the bonds of the 1912 loan for the\r\nrehabilitation of the finances of Liberia will follow at an early date,\r\nwhen the new receivership will go into active operation. The new\r\nreceivership will consist of a general receiver of customs designated by\r\nthe Government of the United States and three receivers of customs\r\ndesignated by the Governments of Germany, France, and Great Britain, which\r\ncountries have commercial interests in the Republic of Liberia.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the understanding between the Government of Liberia and\r\nthat of the United States, and in fulfilling the terms of the agreement\r\nbetween the former Government and the American bankers, three competent\r\nex-army officers are now effectively employed by the Liberian Government in\r\nreorganizing the police force of the Republic, not only to keep in order\r\nthe native tribes in the hinterland but to serve as a necessary police\r\nforce along the frontier. It is hoped that these measures will assure not\r\nonly the continued existence but the prosperity and welfare of the Republic\r\nof Liberia. Liberia possesses fertility of soil and natural resources,\r\nwhich should insure to its people a reasonable prosperity. It was the duty\r\nof the United States to assist the Republic of Liberia in accordance with\r\nour historical interest and moral guardianship of a community founded by\r\nAmerican citizens, as it was also the duty of the American Government to\r\nattempt to assure permanence to a country of much sentimental and perhaps\r\nfuture real interest to a large body of our citizens.\r\n\r\nMOROCCO\r\n\r\nThe legation at Tangier is now in charge of our consul general, who is\r\nacting as charge d'affaires, as well as caring for our commercial interests\r\nin that country. In view of the fact that many of the foreign powers are\r\nnow represented by charges d'affaires it has not been deemed necessary to\r\nappoint at the present time a minister to fill a vacancy occurring in that\r\npost.\r\n\r\nTHE FAR EAST\r\n\r\nThe political disturbances in China in the autumn and winter of 1911-12\r\nresulted in the abdication of the Manchu rulers on February 12, followed by\r\nthe formation of a provisional republican government empowered to conduct\r\nthe affairs of the nation until a permanent government might be regularly\r\nestablished. The natural sympathy of the American people with the\r\nassumption of republican principles by the Chinese people was appropriately\r\nexpressed in a concurrent resolution of Congress on April 17, 1912. A\r\nconstituent assembly, composed of representatives duly chosen by the people\r\nof China in the elections that are now being held, has been called to meet\r\nin January next to adopt a permanent constitution and organize the\r\nGovernment of the nascent Republic. During the formative constitutional\r\nstage and pending definite action by the assembly, as expressive of the\r\npopular will, and the hoped-for establishment of a stable republican form\r\nof government, capable of fulfilling its international obligations, the\r\nUnited States is, according to precedent, maintaining full and friendly de\r\nfacto relations with the provisional Government.\r\n\r\nThe new condition of affairs thus created has presented many serious and\r\ncomplicated problems, both of internal rehabilitation and of international\r\nrelations, whose solution it was realized would necessarily require much\r\ntime and patience. From the beginning of the upheaval last autumn it was\r\nfelt by the United States, in common with the other powers having large\r\ninterests in China, that independent action by the foreign Governments in\r\ntheir own individual interests would add further confusion to a situation\r\nalready complicated. A policy of international cooperation was accordingly\r\nadopted in an understanding, reached early in the disturbances, to act\r\ntogether for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners if\r\nmenaced, to maintain an attitude of strict impartiality as between the\r\ncontending factions, and to abstain from any endeavor to influence the\r\nChinese in their organization of a new form of government. In view of the\r\nseriousness of the disturbances and their general character, the American\r\nminister at Peking was instructed at his discretion to advise our nationals\r\nin the affected districts to concentrate at such centers as were easily\r\naccessible to foreign troops or men of war. Nineteen of our naval vessels\r\nwere stationed at various Chinese ports, and other measures were promptly\r\ntaken for the adequate protection of American interests.\r\n\r\nIt was further mutually agreed, in the hope of hastening an end to\r\nhostilities, that none of the interested powers would approve the making of\r\nloans by its nationals to either side. As soon, however, as a united\r\nprovisional Government of China was assured, the United States joined in a\r\nfavorable consideration of that Government's request for advances needed\r\nfor immediate administrative necessities and later for a loan to effect a\r\npermanent national reorganization. The interested Governments had already,\r\nby common consent, adopted, in respect to the purposes, expenditure, and\r\nsecurity of any loans to China made by their nationals, certain conditions\r\nwhich were held to be essential, not only to secure reasonable protection\r\nfor the foreign investors, but also to safeguard and strengthen China's\r\ncredit by discouraging indiscriminate borrowing and by insuring the\r\napplication of the funds toward the establishment of the stable and\r\neffective government necessary to China's welfare. In June last\r\nrepresentative banking groups of the United States, France, Germany, Great\r\nBritain, Japan, and Russia formulated, with the general sanction of their\r\nrespective Governments, the guaranties that would be expected in relation\r\nto the expenditure and security of the large reorganization loan desired by\r\nChina, which, however, have thus far proved unacceptable to the provisional\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE TO JAPAN\r\n\r\nIn August last I accredited the Secretary of State as special ambassador to\r\nJapan, charged with the mission of bearing to the imperial family, the\r\nGovernment, and the people of that Empire the sympathetic message of the\r\nAmerican Commonwealth oil the sad occasion of the death of His Majesty the\r\nEmperor Mutsuhito, whose long and benevolent reign was the greater part of\r\nJapan's modern history. The kindly reception everywhere accorded to\r\nSecretary Knox showed that his mission was deeply appreciated by the\r\nJapanese nation and emphasized strongly the friendly relations that have\r\nfor so many years existed between the two peoples.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Argentine Republic are most friendly and cordial.\r\nSo, also, are our relations with Brazil, whose Government has accepted the\r\ninvitation of the United States to send two army officers to study at the\r\nCoast Artillery School at Fort Monroe. The long-standing Alsop claim, which\r\nhad been the only hindrance to the healthy growth of the most friendly\r\nrelations between the United States and Chile, having been eliminated\r\nthrough the submission of the question to His Britannic Majesty King George\r\nV as \"amiable compositeur,\" it is a cause of much gratification to me that\r\nour relations with Chile are now established upon a firm basis of growing\r\nfriendship. The Chilean Government has placed an officer of the United\r\nStates Coast Artillery in charge of the Chilean Coast Artillery School, and\r\nhas shown appreciation of American methods by confiding to an American firm\r\nimportant work for the Chilean coast defenses.\r\n\r\nLast year a revolution against the established Government of Ecuador broke\r\nout at the principal port of that Republic. Previous to this occurrence the\r\nchief American interest in Ecuador, represented by the Guayaquil & Quito\r\nRailway Co., incorporated in the United States, had rendered extensive\r\ntransportation and other services on account to the Ecuadorian Government,\r\nthe amount of which ran into a sum which was steadily increasing and which\r\nthe Ecuadorian Government had made no provision to pay, thereby threatening\r\nto crush out the very existence of this American enterprise. When\r\ntranquillity had been restored to Ecuador as a result of the triumphant\r\nprogress of the Government forces from Quito, this Government interposed\r\nits good offices to the end that the American interests in Ecuador might be\r\nsaved from complete extinction. As a part of the arrangement which was\r\nreached between the parties, and at the request of the Government of\r\nEcuador, I have consented to name an arbitrator, who, acting under the\r\nterms of the railroad contract, with an arbitrator named by the Ecuadorian\r\nGovernment, will pass upon the claims that have arisen since the\r\narrangement reached through the action of a similar arbitral tribunal in\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a request made some time ago by the Ecuadorian Government,\r\nthe Department of State has given much attention to the problem of the\r\nproper sanitation of Guayaquil. As a result a detail of officers of the\r\nCanal Zone will be sent to Guayaquil to recommend measures that will lead\r\nto the complete permanent sanitation of this plague and fever infected\r\nregion of that Republic, which has for so long constituted a menace to\r\nhealth conditions on the Canal Zone. It is hoped that the report which this\r\nmission will furnish will point out a way whereby the modicum of assistance\r\nwhich the United States may properly lend the Ecuadorian Government may be\r\nmade effective in ridding the west coast of South America of a focus of\r\ncontagion to the future commercial current passing through the Panama\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the claim of John Celestine Landreau against the\r\nGovernment of Peru, which claim arises out of certain contracts and\r\ntransactions in connection with the discovery and exploitation of guano,\r\nand which has been under discussion between the two Governments since 1874,\r\nI am glad to report that as the result of prolonged negotiations, which\r\nhave been characterized by the utmost friendliness and good will on both\r\nsides, the Department of State has succeeded in securing the consent of\r\nPeru to the arbitration of the claim, and that the negotiations attending\r\nthe drafting and signature of a protocol submitting the claim to an\r\narbitral tribunal are proceeding with due celerity.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the American Public Health Service and an American sanitary\r\nengineer are now on the way to Iquitos, in the employ of the Peruvian\r\nGovernment, to take charge of the sanitation of that river port. Peru is\r\nbuilding a number of submarines in this country, and continues to show\r\nevery desire to have American capital invested in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn July the United States sent undergraduate delegates to the Third\r\nInternational Students Congress held at Lima, American students having been\r\nfor the first time invited to one of these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Uruguay has shown its appreciation of American agricultural\r\nand other methods by sending a large commission to this country and by\r\nemploying many American experts to assist in building up agricultural and\r\nallied industries in Uruguay.\r\n\r\nVenezuela is paying off the last of the claims the settlement of which was\r\nprovided for by the Washington protocols, including those of American\r\ncitizens. Our relations with Venezuela are most cordial, and the trade of\r\nthat Republic with the United States is now greater than with any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer the revolution against the administration which\r\nfollowed the assassination of President Caceres a year ago last November\r\nbrought the Dominican Republic to the verge of administrative chaos,\r\nwithout offering any guaranties of eventual stability in the ultimate\r\nsuccess of either party. In pursuance of the treaty relations of the United\r\nStates with the Dominican Republic, which were threatened by the necessity\r\nof suspending the operation under American administration of the\r\ncustomhouses on the Haitian frontier, it was found necessary to dispatch\r\nspecial commissioners to the island to reestablish the customhouses and\r\nwith a guard sufficient to insure needed protection to the customs\r\nadministration. The efforts which have been made appear to have resulted in\r\nthe restoration of normal conditions throughout the Republic. The good\r\noffices which the commissioners were able to exercise were instrumental in\r\nbringing the contending parties together and in furnishing a basis of\r\nadjustment which it is hoped will result in permanent benefit to the\r\nDominican people.\r\n\r\nMindful of its treaty relations, and owing to the position of the\r\nGovernment of the United States as mediator between the Dominican Republic\r\nand Haiti in their boundary dispute, and because of the further fact that\r\nthe revolutionary activities on the Haitian-Dominican frontier had become\r\nso active as practically to obliterate the line of demarcation that had\r\nbeen heretofore recognized pending the definitive settlement of the\r\nboundary in controversy, it was found necessary to indicate to the two\r\nisland Governments a provisional de facto boundary line. This was done\r\nwithout prejudice to the rights or obligations of either country in a final\r\nsettlement to be reached by arbitration. The tentative line chosen was one\r\nwhich, under the circumstances brought to the knowledge of this Government,\r\nseemed to conform to the best interests of the disputants. The border\r\npatrol which it had been found necessary to reestablish for customs\r\npurposes between the two countries was instructed provisionally to observe\r\nthis line.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Cuba last May was in the throes of a lawless uprising that\r\nfor a time threatened the destruction of a great deal of valuable\r\nproperty-much of it owned by Americans and other foreigners-as well as the\r\nexistence of the Government itself. The armed forces of Cuba being\r\ninadequate to guard property from attack and at the same time properly to\r\noperate against the rebels, a force of American marines was dispatched from\r\nour naval station at Guantanamo into the Province of Oriente for the\r\nprotection of American and other foreign life and property. The Cuban\r\nGovernment was thus able to use all its forces in putting down the\r\noutbreak, which it succeeded in doing in a period of six weeks. The\r\npresence of two American warships in the harbor of Habana during the most\r\ncritical period of this disturbance contributed in great measure to allay\r\nthe fears of the inhabitants, including a large foreign colony.\r\n\r\nThere has been under discussion with the Government of Cuba for some time\r\nthe question of the release by this Government of its leasehold rights at\r\nBahia Honda, on the northern coast of Cuba, and the enlargement, in\r\nexchange therefor, of the naval station which has been established at\r\nGuantanamo Bay, on the south. As the result of the negotiations thus\r\ncarried on an agreement has been reached between the two Governments\r\nproviding for the suitable enlargement of the Guantanamo Bay station upon\r\nterms which are entirely fair and equitable to all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nAt the request alike of the Government and both political parties in\r\nPanama, an American commission undertook supervision of the recent\r\npresidential election in that Republic, where our treaty relations, and,\r\nindeed, every geographical consideration, make the maintenance of order and\r\nsatisfactory conditions of peculiar interest to the Government of the\r\nUnited States. The elections passed without disorder, and the new\r\nadministration has entered upon its functions.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain has asked the support of the United States\r\nfor the protection of the interests of British holders of the foreign\r\nbonded debt of Guatemala. While this Government is hopeful of an\r\narrangement equitable to the British bondholders, it is naturally unable to\r\nview the question apart from its relation to the broad subject of financial\r\nstability in Central America, in which the policy of the United States does\r\nnot permit it to escape a vital interest. Through a renewal of negotiations\r\nbetween the Government of Guatemala and American bankers, the aim of which\r\nis a loan for the rehabilitation of Guatemalan finances, a way appears to\r\nbe open by which the Government of Guatemala could promptly satisfy any\r\nequitable and just British claims, and at the same time so improve its\r\nwhole financial position as to contribute greatly to the increased\r\nprosperity of the Republic and to redound to the benefit of foreign\r\ninvestments and foreign trade with that country. Failing such an\r\narrangement, it may become impossible for the Government of the United\r\nStates to escape its obligations in connection with such measures as may\r\nbecome necessary to exact justice to legitimate foreign claims.\r\n\r\nIn the recent revolution in Nicaragua, which, it was generally admitted,\r\nmight well have resulted in a general Central American conflict but for the\r\nintervention of the United States, the Government of Honduras was\r\nespecially menaced; but fortunately peaceful conditions were maintained\r\nwithin the borders of that Republic. The financial condition of that\r\ncountry remains unchanged, no means having been found for the final\r\nadjustment of pressing outstanding foreign claims. This makes it the more\r\nregrettable that the financial convention between the United States and\r\nHonduras has thus far failed of ratification. The Government of the United\r\nStates continues to hold itself ready to cooperate with the Government of\r\nHonduras, which it is believed, can not much longer delay the meeting of\r\nits foreign obligations, and it is hoped at the proper time American\r\nbankers will be willing to cooperate for this purpose.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY FOR GREATER GOVERNMENTAL EFFORT IN RETENTION AND EXPANSION OF OUR\r\nFOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to make to the Congress a communication upon the present\r\nforeign relations of the United States so detailed as to convey an adequate\r\nimpression of the enormous increase in the importance and activities of\r\nthose relations. If this Government is really to preserve to the American\r\npeople that free opportunity in foreign markets which will soon be\r\nindispensable to our prosperity, even greater efforts must be made.\r\nOtherwise the American merchant, manufacturer, and exporter will find many\r\na field in which American trade should logically predominate preempted\r\nthrough the more energetic efforts of other governments and other\r\ncommercial nations.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which through hearty cooperation the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches of this Government can do much. The absolute essential\r\nis the spirit of united effort and singleness of purpose. I will allude\r\nonly to a very few specific examples of action which ought then to result.\r\nAmerica can not take its proper place in the most important fields for its\r\ncommercial activity and enterprise unless we have a merchant marine.\r\nAmerican commerce and enterprise can not be effectively fostered in those\r\nfields unless we have good American banks in the countries referred to. We\r\nneed American newspapers in those countries and proper means for public\r\ninformation about them. We need to assure the permanency of a trained\r\nforeign service. We need legislation enabling the members of the foreign\r\nservice to be systematically brought in direct contact with the industrial,\r\nmanufacturing, and exporting interests of this country in order that\r\nAmerican business men may enter the foreign field with a clear perception\r\nof the exact conditions to be dealt with and the officers themselves may\r\nprosecute their work with a clear idea of what American industrial and\r\nmanufacturing interests require.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nCongress should fully realize the conditions which obtain in the world as\r\nwe find ourselves at the threshold of our middle age as a Nation. We have\r\nemerged full grown as a peer in the great concourse of nations. We have\r\npassed through various formative periods. We have been self-centered in the\r\nstruggle to develop our domestic resources and deal with our domestic\r\nquestions. The Nation is now too matured to continue in its foreign\r\nrelations those temporary expedients natural to a people to whom domestic\r\naffairs are the sole concern. In the past our diplomacy has often\r\nconsisted, in normal times, in a mere assertion of the right to\r\ninternational existence. We are now in a larger relation with broader\r\nrights of our own and obligations to others than ourselves. A number of\r\ngreat guiding principles were laid down early in the history of this\r\nGovernment. The recent task of our diplomacy has been to adjust those\r\nprinciples to the conditions of to-day, to develop their corollaries, to\r\nfind practical applications of the old principles expanded to meet new\r\nsituations. Thus are being evolved bases upon which can rest the\r\nsuperstructure of policies which must grow with the destined progress of\r\nthis Nation. The successful conduct of our foreign relations demands a\r\nbroad and a modern view. We can not meet new questions nor build for the\r\nfuture if we confine ourselves to outworn dogmas of the past and to the\r\nperspective appropriate at our emergence from colonial times and\r\nconditions. The opening of the Panama Canal will mark a new era in our\r\ninternational life and create new and worldwide conditions which, with\r\ntheir vast correlations and consequences, will obtain for hundreds of years\r\nto come. We must not wait for events to overtake us unawares. With\r\ncontinuity of purpose we must deal with the problems of our external\r\nrelations by a diplomacy modern, resourceful, magnanimous, and fittingly\r\nexpressive of the high ideals of a great nation.\r\n\r\nPart II.[On Fiscal, judicial, Military and Insular Affairs.] THE WHITE\r\nHOUSE, December 6, 1912. To the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of December I sent a message to the Congress, which was confined\r\nto our foreign relations. The Secretary of State makes no report to the\r\nPresident or to Congress, and a review of the history of the transactions\r\nof the State Department in one year must therefore be included by the\r\nPresident in his annual message or Congress will not be fully informed of\r\nthem. A full discussion of all the transactions of the Government, with a\r\nview to informing the Congress of the important events of the year and\r\nrecommending new legislation, requires more space than one message of\r\nreasonable length affords. I have therefore adopted the course of sending\r\nthree or four messages during the first ten days of the session, so as to\r\ninclude reference to the more important matters that should be brought to\r\nthe attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe condition of the country with reference to business could hardly be\r\nbetter. While the four years of the administration now drawing to a close\r\nhave not developed great speculative expansion or a wide field of new\r\ninvestment, the recovery and progress made from the depressing conditions\r\nfollowing the panic of 1907 have been steady and the improvement has been\r\nclear and easily traced in the statistics. The business of the country is\r\nnow on a solid basis. Credits are not unduly extended, and every phase of\r\nthe situation seems in a state of preparedness for a period of unexampled\r\nprosperity. Manufacturing concerns are running at their full capacity and\r\nthe demand for labor was never so constant and growing. The foreign trade\r\nof the country for this year will exceed $4,000,000,000, while the balance\r\nin our favor-that of the excess of exports over imports-will exceed\r\n$500,000,000. More than half our exports are manufactures or partly\r\nmanufactured material, while our exports of farm products do not show the\r\nsame increase because of domestic consumption. It is a year of bumper\r\ncrops; the total money value of farm products will exceed $9,500,000,000.\r\nIt is a year when the bushel or unit price of agricultural products has\r\ngradually fallen, and yet the total value of the entire crop is greater by\r\nover $1,000,000,000 than we have known in our history.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE TREASURY\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Treasury is very satisfactory. The total\r\ninterest-bearing debt is $963,777,770, of which $134,631,980 constitute the\r\nPanama Canal loan. The noninterest-bearing debt is $378,301,284.90,\r\nincluding $346,681,016 of greenbacks. We have in the Treasury $150,000,000\r\nin gold coin as a reserve against the outstanding greenbacks; and in\r\naddition we have a cash balance in the Treasury as a general fund of\r\n$167,152,478.99, or an increase of $26,975,552 over the general fund last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nRECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES\r\n\r\nFor three years the expenditures of the Government have decreased under the\r\ninfluence of an effort to economize. This year presents an apparent\r\nexception. The estimate by the Secretary of the Treasury of the ordinary\r\nreceipts, exclusive of postal revenues, for the year ending June 30, 1914,\r\nindicates that they will amount to $710,000,000. The sum of the estimates\r\nof the expenditures for that same year, exclusive of Panama Canal\r\ndisbursements and postal disbursements payable from postal revenues, is\r\n$732,000,000, indicating a deficit Of $22,000,000. For the year ending June\r\n30, 1913, similarly estimated receipts were $667,000,000, while the total\r\ncorresponding estimate of expenditures for that year, submitted through the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to Congress, amounted to $656,000,000. This shows\r\nan increase of $76,000,000 in the estimates for 1914 over the total\r\nestimates of 1913. This is due to an increase Of $25,000,000 in the\r\nestimate for rivers and harbors for the next year on projects and surveys\r\nauthorized by Congress; to an increase under the new pension bill Of\r\n$32,500,000; and to an increase in the estimates for expenses of the Navy\r\nDepartment Of $24,000,000. The estimate for the Navy Department for the\r\nyear 1913 included two battleships. Congress made provision for only one\r\nbattleship, and therefore the Navy Department has deemed it necessary and\r\nproper to make an estimate which includes the first year's expenditure for\r\nthree battleships in addition to the amount required for work on the\r\nuncompleted ships now under construction. In addition to the natural\r\nincrease in the expenditures for the uncompleted ships, and the additional\r\nbattleship estimated for, the other increases are due to the pay\r\nrequired for 4,000 or more additional enlisted men in the Navy; and to this\r\nmust be added the additional cost of construction imposed by the change in\r\nthe eight-hour law which makes it applicable to ships built in private\r\nshipyards.\r\n\r\nWith the exceptions of these three items, the estimates show a reduction\r\nthis year below the total estimates for 1913 of more than $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for Panama Canal construction for 1914 are $17,000,000 less\r\nthan for 1913.\r\n\r\nOUR BANKING AND CURRENCY SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA time when panics seem far removed is the best time for us to prepare our\r\nfinancial system to withstand a storm. The most crying need this country\r\nhas is a proper banking and currency system. The existing one is\r\ninadequate, and everyone who has studied the question admits it.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the National Government to provide a medium,\r\nautomatically contracting and expanding in volume, to meet the needs of\r\ntrade. Our present system lacks the indispensable quality of elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe only part of our monetary medium that has elasticity is the bank-note\r\ncurrency. The peculiar provisions of the law requiring national banks to\r\nmaintain reserves to meet the call of the depositors operates to increase\r\nthe money stringency when it arises rather than to expand the supply of\r\ncurrency and relieve it. It operates upon each bank and furnishes a motive\r\nfor the withdrawal of currency from the channels of trade by each bank to\r\nsave itself, and offers no inducement whatever for the use of the reserve\r\nto expand the supply of currency to meet the exceptional demand.\r\n\r\nAfter the panic of 1907 Congress realized that the present system was not\r\nadapted to the country's needs and that under it panics were possible that\r\nmight properly be avoided by legislative provision. Accordingly a monetary\r\ncommission was appointed which made a report in February, 1912. The system\r\nwhich they recommended involved a National Reserve Association, which was,\r\nin certain of its faculties and functions, a bank, and which was given\r\nthrough its governing authorities the power, by issuing circulating notes\r\nfor approved commercial paper, by fixing discounts, and by other methods of\r\ntransfer of currency, to expand the supply of the monetary medium where it\r\nwas most needed to prevent the export or hoarding of gold and generally to\r\nexercise such supervision over the supply of money in every part of the\r\ncountry as to prevent a stringency and a panic. The stock in this\r\nassociation was to be distributed to the banks of the whole United States,\r\nState and National, in a mixed proportion to bank units and to capital\r\nstock paid in. The control of the association was vested in a board of\r\ndirectors to be elected by representatives of the banks, except certain\r\nex-officio directors, three Cabinet officers, and the Comptroller of the\r\nCurrency. The President was to appoint the governor of the association from\r\nthree persons to be selected by the directors, while the two deputy\r\ngovernors were to be elected by the board of directors. The details of the\r\nplan were worked out with great care and ability, and the plan in general\r\nseems to me to furnish the basis for a proper solution of our present\r\ndifficulties. I feel that the Government might very properly be given a\r\ngreater voice in the executive committee of the board of directors without\r\ndanger of injecting politics into its management, but I think the\r\nfederation system of banks is a good one, provided proper precautions are\r\ntaken to prevent banks of large capital from absorbing power through\r\nownership of stock in other banks. The objections to a central bank it\r\nseems to me are obviated if the ownership of the reserve association is\r\ndistributed among all the banks of a country in which banking is free. The\r\nearnings of the reserve association are limited in percentage tit a\r\nreasonable and fixed amount, and the profits over and above this are to be\r\nturned into the Government Treasury. It is quite probable that still\r\ngreater security against control by money centers may be worked into the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, however, that the objections which were made in the past\r\nhistory of this country to a central bank as furnishing a monopoly of\r\nfinancial power to private individuals, would not apply to an association\r\nwhose ownership and control is so widely distributed and is divided between\r\nall the banks of the country, State and National, on the one hand, and the\r\nChief Executive through three department heads and his Comptroller of the\r\nCurrency, on the other. The ancient hostility to a national bank, with its\r\nbranches, in which is concentrated the privilege of doing a banking\r\nbusiness and carrying on the financial transactions of the Government, has\r\nprevented the establishment of such a bank since it was abolished in the\r\nJackson Administration. Our present national banking law has obviated\r\nobjections growing out of the same cause by providing a free banking system\r\nin which any set of stockholders can establish a national bank if they\r\ncomply with the conditions of law. It seems to me that the National Reserve\r\nAssociation meets the same objection in a similar way; that is, by giving\r\nto each bank, State and National, in accordance with its size, a certain\r\nshare in the stock of the reserve association, nontransferable and only to\r\nbe held by the bank while it performs its functions as a partner in the\r\nreserve association.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commission recommends provisions for the imposition of a\r\ngraduated tax on the expanded currency of such a character as to furnish a\r\nmotive for reducing the issue of notes whenever their presence in the money\r\nmarket is not required by the exigencies of trade. In other words, the\r\nwhole system has been worked out with the greatest care. Theoretically it\r\npresents a plan that ought to command support. Practically it may require\r\nmodification in various of its provisions in order to make the security\r\nagainst, abuses by combinations among the banks impossible. But in the face\r\nof the crying necessity that there is for improvement in our present\r\nsystem, I urgently invite the attention of Congress to the proposed plan\r\nand the report of the commission, with the hope that an earnest\r\nconsideration may suggest amendments and changes within the general plan\r\nwhich will lead to its adoption for the benefit of the country. There is no\r\nclass in the community more interested in a safe and sane banking and\r\ncurrency system, one which will prevent panics and automatically furnish in\r\neach trade center the currency needed in the carrying on of the business at\r\nthat center, than the wage earner. There is no class in the community whose\r\nexperience better qualifies them to make suggestions as to the sufficiency\r\nof a currency and banking system than the bankers and business men. Ought\r\nwe, therefore, to ignore their recommendations and reject their financial\r\njudgment as to the proper method of reforming our financial system merely\r\nbecause of the suspicion which exists against them in the minds of many of\r\nour fellow citizens? Is it not the duty of Congress to take up the plan\r\nsuggested, examine it from all standpoints, give impartial consideration to\r\nthe testimony of those whose experience ought to fit them to give the best\r\nadvice on the subject, and then to adopt some plan which will secure the\r\nbenefits desired?\r\n\r\nA banking and currency system seems far away from the wage earner and the\r\nfarmer, but the fact is that they are vitally interested in a safe system\r\nof currency which shall graduate its volume to the amount needed and which\r\nshall prevent times of artificial stringency that frighten capital, stop\r\nemployment, prevent the meeting of the pay roll, destroy local markets, and\r\nproduce penury and want.\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF\r\n\r\nI have regarded it as my duty in former messages to the Congress to urge\r\nthe revision of the tariff upon principles of protection. It was my\r\njudgment that the customs duties ought to be revised downward, but that the\r\nreduction ought not to be below a rate which would represent the difference\r\nin the cost of production between the article in question at home and\r\nabroad, and for this and other reasons I vetoed several bills which were\r\npresented to me in the last session of this Congress. Now that a new\r\nCongress has been elected on a platform of a tariff for revenue only rather\r\nthan a protective tariff, and is to revise the tariff on that basis, it is\r\nneedless for me to occupy the time of this Congress with arguments or\r\nrecommendations in favor of a protective tariff.\r\n\r\nBefore passing from the tariff law, however, known as the Payne tariff law\r\nof August 5, 1909, I desire to call attention to section 38 of that act,\r\nassessing a special excise tax on corporations. It contains a provision\r\nrequiring the levy of an additional 50 per cent to the annual tax in cases\r\nof neglect to verify the prescribed return or to file it before the time\r\nrequired by law. This additional charge of 50 per cent operates in some\r\ncases as a harsh penalty for what may have been a mere inadvertence or\r\nunintentional oversight, and the law should be so amended as to mitigate\r\nthe severity of the charge in such instances. Provision should also be made\r\nfor the refund of additional taxes heretofore collected because of such\r\ninfractions in those cases where the penalty imposed has been so\r\ndisproportionate to the offense as equitably to demand relief.\r\n\r\nBUDGET\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the next fiscal year have been assembled by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and by him transmitted to Congress. I purpose at a later\r\nday to submit to Congress a form of budget prepared for me and recommended\r\nby the President's Commission on Economy and Efficiency, with a view of\r\nsuggesting the useful and informing character of a properly framed budget.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nThe War Department combines within its jurisdiction functions which in\r\nother countries usually occupy three departments. It not only has the\r\nmanagement of the Army and the coast defenses, but its jurisdiction extends\r\nto the government of the Philippines and of Porto Rico and the control of\r\nthe receivership of the customs revenues of the Dominican Republic; it also\r\nincludes the recommendation of all plans for the improvement of harbors and\r\nwaterways and their execution when adopted; and, by virtue of an Executive\r\norder, the supervision of the construction of the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nARMY REORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nOur small Army now consists of 83,809 men, excluding the 5,000 Philippine\r\nscouts. Leaving out of consideration the Coast Artillery force, whose\r\nposition is fixed in our various seacoast defenses, and the present\r\ngarrisons of our various insular possessions, we have to-day within the\r\ncontinental United States a mobile Army of only about 35,000 men. This\r\nlittle force must be still further drawn upon to supply the new garrisons\r\nfor the great naval base which is being established at Pearl Harbor, in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, and to protect the locks now rapidly approaching\r\ncompletion at Panama. The forces remaining in the United States are now\r\nscattered in nearly 50 Posts, situated for a variety of historical reasons\r\nin 24 States. These posts contain only fractions of regiments, averaging\r\nless than 700 men each. In time of peace it has been our historical policy\r\nto administer these units separately by a geographical organization. In\r\nother words, our Army in time of peace has never been a united organization\r\nbut merely scattered groups of companies, battalions, and regiments, and\r\nthe first task in time of war has been to create out of these scattered\r\nunits an Army fit for effective teamwork and cooperation.\r\n\r\nTo the task of meeting these patent defects, the War Department has been\r\naddressing itself during the past year. For many years we had no officer or\r\ndivision whose business it was to study these problems and plan remedies\r\nfor these defects. With the establishment of the General Staff nine years\r\nago a body was created for this purpose. It has, necessarily, required time\r\nto overcome, even in its own personnel, the habits of mind engendered by a\r\ncentury of lack of method, but of late years its work has become systematic\r\nand effective, and it has recently been addressing itself vigorously to\r\nthese problems.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive plan of Army reorganization was prepared by the War College\r\nDivision of the General Staff. This plan was thoroughly discussed last\r\nsummer at a series of open conferences held by the Secretary of War and\r\nattended by representatives from all branches of the Army and from\r\nCongress. In printed form it has been distributed to Members of Congress\r\nand throughout the Army and the National Guard, and widely through\r\ninstitutions of learning and elsewhere in the United States. In it, for the\r\nfirst time, we have a tentative chart for future progress.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this study definite and effective steps have been\r\ntaken toward Army reorganization so far as such reorganization lies within\r\nthe Executive power. Hitherto there has been no difference of policy in the\r\ntreatment of the organization of our foreign garrisons from those of troops\r\nwithin the United States. The difference of situation is vital, and the\r\nforeign garrison should be prepared to defend itself at an instant's notice\r\nagainst a foe who may command the sea. Unlike the troops in the United\r\nStates, it can not count upon reinforcements or recruitment. It is an\r\noutpost upon which will fall the brunt of the first attack in case of war.\r\nThe historical policy of the United States of carrying its regiments during\r\ntime of peace at half strength has no application to our foreign garrisons.\r\nDuring the past year this defect has been remedied as to the Philippines\r\ngarrison. The former garrison of 12 reduced regiments has been replaced by\r\na garrison of 6 regiments at full strength, giving fully the same number of\r\nriflemen at an estimated economy in cost of maintenance of over $1,000,000\r\nper year. This garrison is to be permanent. Its regimental units, instead\r\nof being transferred periodically back and forth from the United States,\r\nwill remain in the islands. The officers and men composing these units\r\nwill, however, serve a regular tropical detail as usual, thus involving no\r\ngreater hardship upon the personnel and greatly increasing the\r\neffectiveness of the garrison. A similar policy is proposed for the\r\nHawaiian and Panama garrisons as fast as the barracks for them are\r\ncompleted. I strongly urge upon Congress that the necessary appropriations\r\nfor this purpose should be promptly made. It is, in my opinion, of first\r\nimportance that these national outposts, upon which a successful home\r\ndefense will, primarily, depend, should be finished and placed in effective\r\ncondition at the earliest possible day.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME ARMY\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the foregoing steps the War Department has been\r\nproceeding with the reorganization of the Army at home. The formerly\r\ndisassociated units are being united into a tactical organization of three\r\ndivisions, each consisting of two or three brigades of Infantry and, so far\r\nas practicable, a proper proportion of divisional Cavalry and Artillery. Of\r\ncourse, the extent to which this reform can be carried by the Executive is\r\npractically limited to a paper organization. The scattered units can be\r\nbrought under a proper organization, but they will remain physically\r\nscattered until Congress supplies the necessary funds for grouping them in\r\nmore concentrated posts. Until that is done the present difficulty of\r\ndrilling our scattered groups together, and thus training them for the\r\nproper team play, can not be removed. But we shall, at least, have an Army\r\nwhich will know its own organization and will be inspected by its proper\r\ncommanders, and to which, as a unit, emergency orders can be issued in time\r\nof war or other emergency. Moreover, the organization, which in many\r\nrespects is necessarily a skeleton, will furnish a guide for future\r\ndevelopment. The separate regiments and companies will know the brigades\r\nand divisions to which they belong. They will be maneuvered together\r\nwhenever maneuvers are established by Congress, and the gaps in their\r\norganization will show the pattern into which can be filled new troops as\r\nthe Nation grows and a larger Army is provided.\r\n\r\nREGULAR ARMY RESERVE\r\n\r\nOne of the most important reforms accomplished during the past year has\r\nbeen the legislation enacted in the Army appropriation bill of last summer,\r\nproviding for a Regular Army reserve. Hitherto our national policy has\r\nassumed that at the outbreak of war our regiments would be immediately\r\nraised to full strength. But our laws have provided no means by which this\r\ncould be accomplished, or by which the losses of the regiments when once\r\nsent to the front could be repaired. In this respect we have neglected the\r\nlessons learned by other nations. The new law provides that the soldier,\r\nafter serving four years with colors, shall pass into a reserve for three\r\nyears. At his option he may go into the reserve at the end of three years,\r\nremaining there for four years. While in the reserve he can be called to\r\nactive duty only in case of war or other national emergency, and when so\r\ncalled and only in such case will receive a stated amount of pay for all of\r\nthe period in which he has been a member of the reserve. The legislation is\r\nimperfect, in my opinion, in certain particulars, but it is a most\r\nimportant step in the right direction, and I earnestly hope that it will be\r\ncarefully studied and perfected by Congress.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL GUARD\r\n\r\nUnder existing law the National Guard constitutes, after the Regular Army,\r\nthe first line of national defense. Its organization, discipline, training,\r\nand equipment, under recent legislation, have been assimilated, as far as\r\npossible, to those of the Regular Army, and its practical efficiency, under\r\nthe effect of this training, has very greatly increased. Our citizen\r\nsoldiers under present conditions have reached a stage of development\r\nbeyond which they can not reasonably be asked to go without further direct\r\nassistance in the form of pay from the Federal Government. On the other\r\nhand, such pay from the National Treasury would not be justified unless it\r\nproduced a proper equivalent in additional efficiency on the part of the\r\nNational Guard. The Organized Militia to-day can not be ordered outside of\r\nthe limits of the United States, and thus can not lawfully be used for\r\ngeneral military purposes. The officers and men are ambitious and eager to\r\nmake themselves thus available and to become an efficient national reserve\r\nof citizen soldiery. They are the only force of trained men, other than the\r\nRegular Army, upon which we can rely. The so-called militia pay bill, in\r\nthe form agreed on between the authorities of the War Department and the\r\nrepresentatives of the National Guard, in my opinion adequately meets these\r\nconditions and offers a proper return for the pay which it is proposed to\r\ngive to the National Guard. I believe that its enactment into law would be\r\na very long step toward providing this Nation with a first line of citizen\r\nsoldiery, upon which its main reliance must depend in case of any national\r\nemergency. Plans for the organization of the National Guard into tactical\r\ndivisions, on the same lines as those adopted for the Regular Army, are\r\nbeing formulated by the War College Division of the General Staff.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL VOLUNTEERS\r\n\r\nThe National Guard consists of only about 110,000 men. In any serious war\r\nin the past it has always been necessary, and in such a war in the future\r\nit doubtless will be necessary, for the Nation to depend, in addition to\r\nthe Regular Army and the National Guard, upon a large force of volunteers.\r\nThere is at present no adequate provision of law for the raising of such a\r\nforce. There is now pending in Congress, however, a bill which makes such\r\nprovision, and which I believe is admirably adapted to meet the exigencies\r\nwhich would be presented in case of war. The passage of the bill would not\r\nentail a dollar's expense upon the Government at this time or in the future\r\nuntil war comes. But if war comes the methods therein directed are in\r\naccordance with the best military judgment as to what they ought to be, and\r\nthe act would prevent the necessity for a discussion of any legislation and\r\nthe delays incident to its consideration and adoption. I earnestly urge its\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nCONSOLIDATION OF THE SUPPLY CORPS\r\n\r\nThe Army appropriation act of 191:2 also carried legislation for the\r\nconsolidation of the Quartermaster's Department, the Subsistence\r\nDepartment, and the Pay Corps into a single supply department, to be known\r\nas the Quartermaster's Corps. It also provided for the organization of a\r\nspecial force of enlisted men, to be known as the Service Corps, gradually\r\nto replace many of the civilian employees engaged in the manual labor\r\nnecessary in every army. I believe that both of these enactments will\r\nimprove the administration of our military establishment. The consolidation\r\nof the supply corps has already been effected, and the organization of the\r\nservice corps is being put into effect.\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing reforms are in the direction of economy and\r\nefficiency. Except for the slight increase necessary to garrison our\r\noutposts in Hawaii and Panama, they do not call for a larger Army, but they\r\ndo tend to produce a much more efficient one. The only substantial new\r\nappropriations required are those which, as I have pointed out, are\r\nnecessary to complete the fortifications and barracks at our naval bases\r\nand outposts beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO\r\n\r\nPorto Rico continues to show notable progress, both commercially and in the\r\nspread of education. Its external commerce has increased 17 per cent over\r\nthe preceding year, bringing the total value up to $92,631,886, or more\r\nthan five times the value of the commerce of the island in 1901. During the\r\nyear 160,657 Pupils were enrolled in the public schools, as against 145,525\r\nfor the preceding year, and as compared with 26,000 for the first year of\r\nAmerican administration. Special efforts are under way for the promotion of\r\nvocational and industrial training, the need of which is particularly\r\npressing in the island. When the bubonic plague broke out last June, the\r\nquick and efficient response of the people of Porto Rico to the demands of\r\nmodern sanitation was strikingly shown by the thorough campaign which was\r\ninstituted against the plague and the hearty public opinion which supported\r\nthe Government's efforts to check its progress and to prevent its\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\nThe failure thus far to grant American citizenship continues to be the only\r\nground of dissatisfaction. The bill conferring such citizenship has passed\r\nthe House of Representatives and is now awaiting the action of the Senate.\r\nI am heartily in favor of the passage of this bill. I believe that the\r\ndemand for citizenship is just, and that it is amply earned by sustained\r\nloyalty on the part of the inhabitants of the island. But it should be\r\nremembered that the demand must be, and in the minds of most Porto Ricans\r\nis, entirely disassociated from any thought of statehood. I believe that no\r\nsubstantial approved public opinion in the United States or in Porto Rico\r\ncontemplates statehood for the island as the ultimate form of relations\r\nbetween us. I believe that the aim to be striven for is the fullest\r\npossible allowance of legal and fiscal self-government, with American\r\ncitizenship as to the bond between us; in other words, a relation analogous\r\nto the present relation between Great Britain and such self-governing\r\ncolonies as Canada and Australia. This would conduce to the fullest and\r\nmost self-sustaining development of Porto Rico, while at the same time it\r\nwould grant her the economic and political benefits of being under the\r\nAmerican flag.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINES\r\n\r\nA bill is pending in Congress which revolutionizes the carefully worked out\r\nscheme of government under which the Philippine Islands are now governed\r\nand which proposes to render them virtually autonomous at once and\r\nabsolutely independent in eight years. Such a proposal can only be founded\r\non the assumption that we have now discharged our trusteeship to the\r\nFilipino people and our responsibility for them to the world, and that they\r\nare now prepared for self-government as well as national sovereignty. A\r\nthorough and unbiased knowledge of the facts clearly shows that these\r\nassumptions are absolutely without justification. As to this, I believe\r\nthat there is no substantial difference of opinion among any of those who\r\nhave had the responsibility of facing Philippine problems in the\r\nadministration of the islands, and I believe that no one to whom the future\r\nof this people is a responsible concern can countenance a policy fraught\r\nwith the direst consequences to those on whose behalf it is ostensibly\r\nurged.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippine Islands we have embarked upon an experiment unprecedented\r\nin dealing with dependent people. We are developing there conditions\r\nexclusively for their own welfare. We found an archipelago containing 24\r\ntribes and races, speaking a great variety of languages, and with a\r\npopulation over 80 per cent of which could neither read nor write. Through\r\nthe unifying forces of a common education, of commercial and economic\r\ndevelopment, and of gradual participation in local self-government we are\r\nendeavoring to evolve a homogeneous people fit to determine, when the time\r\narrives, their own destiny. We are seeking to arouse a national spirit and\r\nnot, as under the older colonial theory, to suppress such a spirit. The\r\ncharacter of the work we have been doing is keenly recognized in the\r\nOrient, and our success thus far followed with not a little envy by those\r\nwho, initiating the same policy, find themselves hampered by conditions\r\ngrown up in earlier days and under different theories of administration.\r\nBut our work is far from done. Our duty to the Filipinos is far from\r\ndischarged. Over half a million Filipino students are now in the Philippine\r\nschools helping to mold the men of the future into a homogeneous people,\r\nbut there still remain more than a million Filipino children of school age\r\nyet to be reached. Freed from American control the integrating forces of a\r\ncommon education and a common language will cease and the educational\r\nsystem now well started will slip back into inefficiency and disorder.\r\n\r\nAn enormous increase in the commercial development of the islands has been\r\nmade since they were virtually granted full access to our markets three\r\nyears ago, with every prospect of increasing development and diversified\r\nindustries. Freed from American control such development is bound to\r\ndecline. Every observer speaks of the great progress in public works for\r\nthe benefit of the Filipinos, of harbor improvements, of roads and\r\nrailways, of irrigation and artesian wells, public buildings, and better\r\nmeans of communication. But large parts of the islands are still unreached,\r\nstill even unexplored, roads and railways are needed in many parts,\r\nirrigation systems are still to be installed, and wells to be driven. Whole\r\nvillages and towns are still without means of communication other than\r\nalmost impassable roads and trails. Even the great progress in sanitation,\r\nwhich has successfully suppressed smallpox, the bubonic plague, and Asiatic\r\ncholera, has found the cause of and a cure for beriberi, has segregated the\r\nlepers, has helped to make Manila the most healthful city in the Orient,\r\nand to free life throughout the whole archipelago from its former dread\r\ndiseases, is nevertheless incomplete in many essentials of permanence in\r\nsanitary policy. Even more remains to be accomplished. If freed from\r\nAmerican control sanitary progress is bound to be arrested and all that has\r\nbeen achieved likely to be lost.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with the economic, social, and industrial development of the\r\nislands has been the development of the political capacity of the people.\r\nBy their progressive participation in government the Filipinos are being\r\nsteadily and hopefully trained for self-government. Under Spanish control\r\nthey shared in no way in the government. Under American control they have\r\nshared largely and increasingly. Within the last dozen years they have\r\ngradually been given complete autonomy in the municipalities, the right to\r\nelect two-thirds of the provincial governing boards and the lower house of\r\nthe insular legislature. They have four native members out of nine members\r\nof the commission, or upper house. The chief justice and two justices of\r\nthe supreme court, about one-half of the higher judicial positions, and all\r\nof the justices of the peach are natives. In the classified civil service\r\nthe proportion of Filipinos increased from 51 per cent in 1904 to 67 per\r\ncent in 1911. Thus to-day all the municipal employees, over go per cent of\r\nthe provincial employees, and 60 per cent of the officials and employees of\r\nthe central government are Filipinos. The ideal which has been kept in mind\r\nin our political guidance of the islands has been real popular\r\nself-government and not mere paper independence. I am happy to say that the\r\nFilipinos have done well enough in the places they have filled and in the\r\ndischarge of the political power with which they have been intrusted to\r\nwarrant the belief that they can be educated and trained to complete\r\nself-government. But the present satisfactory results are due to constant\r\nsupport and supervision at every step by Americans.\r\n\r\nIf the task we have undertaken is higher than that assumed by other\r\nnations, its accomplishment must demand even more patience. We must not\r\nforget that we found the Filipinos wholly untrained in government. Up to\r\nour advent all other experience sought to repress rather than encourage\r\npolitical power. It takes long time and much experience to ingrain\r\npolitical habits of steadiness and efficiency. Popular self-government\r\nultimately must rest upon common habits of thought and upon a reasonably\r\ndeveloped public opinion. No such foundations for self-government, let alone\r\nindependence are now present in the Philippine Islands. Disregarding even\r\ntheir racial heterogeneity and the lack of ability to think as a nation, it\r\nis sufficient to point out that under liberal franchise privileges only\r\nabout 3 per cent of the Filipinos vote and only 5 per cent of the people\r\nare said to read the public press. To confer independence upon the\r\nFilipinos now is, therefore, to subject the great mass of their people to\r\nthe dominance of an oligarchical and, probably, exploiting minority. Such a\r\ncourse will be as cruel to those people as it would be shameful to us.\r\n\r\nOur true course is to pursue steadily and courageously the path we have\r\nthus far followed; to guide the Filipinos into self-sustaining pursuits; to\r\ncontinue the cultivation of sound political habits through education and\r\npolitical practice; to encourage the diversification of industries, and to\r\nrealize the advantages of their industrial education by conservatively\r\napproved cooperative methods, at once checking the dangers of concentrated\r\nwealth and building up a sturdy, independent citizenship. We should do all\r\nthis with a disinterested endeavor to secure for the Filipinos economic\r\nindependence and to fit them for complete self-government, with the power\r\nto decide eventually, according to their own largest good, whether such\r\nself-government shall be accompanied by independence. A present declaration\r\neven of future independence would retard progress by the dissension and\r\ndisorder it would arouse. On our part it would be a disingenuous attempt,\r\nunder the guise of conferring a benefit on them, to relieve ourselves from\r\nthe heavy and difficult burden which thus far we have been bravely and\r\nconsistently sustaining. It would be a disguised policy of scuttle. It\r\nwould make the helpless Filipino the football of oriental politics, tinder\r\nthe protection of a guaranty of their independence, which we would be\r\npowerless to enforce.\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF WATER POWER\r\n\r\nThere are pending before Congress a large number of bills proposing to\r\ngrant privileges of erecting dams for the purpose of creating water power\r\nin our navigable rivers. The pendency of these bills has brought out an\r\nimportant defect in the existing general dam act. That act does not, in my\r\nopinion, grant sufficient power to the Federal Government in dealing with\r\nthe construction of such dams to exact protective conditions in the\r\ninterest of navigation. It does not permit the Federal Government, as a\r\ncondition of its permit, to require that a part of the value thus created\r\nshall be applied to the further general improvement and protection of the\r\nstream. I believe this to be one of the most important matters of internal\r\nimprovement now confronting the Government. Most of the navigable rivers of\r\nthis country are comparatively long and shallow. In order that they may be\r\nmade fully useful for navigation there has come into vogue a method of\r\nimprovement known as canalization, or the slack-water method, which\r\nconsists in building a series of dams and locks, each of which will create\r\na long pool of deep navigable water. At each of these dams there is usually\r\ncreated also water power of commercial value. If the water power thus\r\ncreated can be made available for the further improvement of navigation in\r\nthe stream, it is manifest that the improvement will be much more quickly\r\neffected on the one hand, and, on the other, that the burden on the general\r\ntaxpayers of the country will be very much reduced. Private interests\r\nseeking permits to build water-power dams in navigable streams usually urge\r\nthat they thus improve navigation, and that if they do not impair\r\nnavigation they should be allowed to take for themselves the entire profits\r\nof the water-power development. Whatever they may do by way of relieving\r\nthe Government of the expense of improving navigation should be given due\r\nconsideration, but it must be apparent that there may be a profit beyond a\r\nreasonably liberal return upon the private investment which is a potential\r\nasset of the Government in carrying out a comprehensive policy of waterway\r\ndevelopment. It is no objection to the retention and use of such an asset\r\nby the Government that a comprehensive waterway policy will include the\r\nprotection and development of the other public uses of water, which can not\r\nand should not be ignored in making and executing plans for the protection\r\nand development of navigation. It is also equally clear that inasmuch as\r\nthe water power thus created is or may be an incident of a general scheme\r\nof waterway improvement within the constitutional jurisdiction of the\r\nFederal Government, the regulation of such water power lies also within\r\nthat jurisdiction. In my opinion constructive statesmanship requires that\r\nlegislation should be enacted which will permit the development of\r\nnavigation in these great rivers to go hand in hand with the utilization of\r\nthis by-product of water power, created in the course of the same\r\nimprovement, and that the general dam act should be so amended as to make\r\nthis possible. I deem it highly important that the Nation should adopt a\r\nconsistent and harmonious treatment of these water-power projects, which\r\nwill preserve for this purpose their value to the Government, whose right\r\nit is to grant the permit. Any other policy is equivalent to throwing away\r\na most valuable national asset.\r\n\r\nTHE PANAMA CANAL\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the work of construction upon the canal has progressed\r\nmost satisfactorily. About 87 per cent of the excavation work has been\r\ncompleted, and more than 93 per cent of the concrete for all the locks is\r\nin place. In view of the great interest which has been manifested as to\r\nsome slides in the Culebra Cut, I am glad to say that the report of Col.\r\nGoethals should allay any apprehension on this point. It is gratifying to\r\nnote that none of the slides which occurred during this year would have\r\ninterfered with the passage of the ships had the canal, in fact, been in\r\noperation, and when the slope pressures will have been finally adjusted and\r\nthe growth of vegetation will minimize erosion in the banks of the cut, the\r\nslide problem will be practically solved and an ample stability assured for\r\nthe Culebra Cut.\r\n\r\nAlthough the official date of the opening has been set for January 1, 1915,\r\nthe canal will, in fact, from present indications, be opened for shipping\r\nduring the latter half of 1913. No fixed date can as yet be set, but\r\nshipping interests will be advised as soon as assurances can be given that\r\nvessels can pass through without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the administrative problem in the management of the canal,\r\nCongress in the act of August 24, 1912, has made admirable provisions for\r\nexecutive responsibility in the control of the canal and the government of\r\nthe Canal Zone. The problem of most efficient organization is receiving\r\ncareful consideration, so that a scheme of organization and control best\r\nadapted to the conditions of the canal may be formulated and put in\r\noperation as expeditiously as possible. Acting tinder the authority\r\nconferred on me by Congress, I have, by Executive proclamation, promulgated\r\nthe following schedule of tolls for ships passing through the canal, based\r\nupon the thorough report of Emory R. Johnson, special commissioner on\r\ntraffic and tolls:\r\n\r\nI. On merchant vessels carrying passengers or cargo, $1.20 per net vessel\r\nton-each 100 cubic feet-of actual earning capacity. 2. On vessels in\r\nballast without passengers or cargo, 40 per cent less than the rate of\r\ntolls for vessels with passengers or cargo. 3. Upon naval vessels, other\r\nthan transports, colliers, hospital ships, and supply ships, 50 cents per\r\ndisplacement ton. 4. Upon Army and Navy transports, colliers, hospital\r\nships, and supply ships, $1.20 per net ton, the vessels to be measured by\r\nthe same rules as are employed in determining the net tonnage of merchant\r\nvessels. Rules for the determination of the tonnage upon which toll charges\r\nare based are now in course of preparation and will be promulgated in due\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL TREATY\r\n\r\nThe proclamation which I have issued in respect to the Panama Canal tolls\r\nis in accord with the Panama Canal act passed by this Congress August 24,\r\n1912. We have been advised that the British Government has prepared a\r\nprotest against the act and its enforcement in so far as it relieves from\r\nthe payment of tolls American ships engaged in the American coastwise trade\r\non the ground that it violates British rights tinder the Hay-Pauncefote\r\ntreaty concerning the Panama Canal. When the protest is presented, it will\r\nbe promptly considered and an effort made to reach a satisfactory\r\nadjustment of any differences there may be between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of an efficient workmen's compensation act, adapted to the\r\nparticular conditions of the zone, is awaiting adequate appropriation by\r\nCongress for the payment of claims arising thereunder. I urge that speedy\r\nprovision be made in order that we may install upon the zone a system of\r\nsettling claims for injuries in best accord with modern humane, social, and\r\nindustrial theories.\r\n\r\nPROMOTION FOR COL. GOETHALS\r\n\r\nAs the completion of the canal grows nearer, and as the wonderful executive\r\nwork of Col. Goethals becomes more conspicuous in the eyes of the country\r\nand of the world, it seems to me wise and proper to make provision by law\r\nfor such reward to him as may be commensurate with the service that he has\r\nrendered to his country. I suggest that this reward take the form of an\r\nappointment of Col. Goethals as a major general in the Army of the United\r\nStates, and that the law authorizing such appointment be accompanied with a\r\nprovision permitting his designation as Chief of Engineers upon the\r\nretirement of the present incumbent of that office.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nThe Navy of the United States is in a greater state of efficiency and is\r\nmore powerful than it has ever been before, but in the emulation which\r\nexists between different countries in respect to the increase of naval and\r\nmilitary armaments this condition is not a permanent one. In view of the\r\nmany improvements and increases by foreign Governments the slightest halt\r\non our part in respect to new construction throws us back and reduces us\r\nfrom a naval power of the first rank and places us among the nations of the\r\nsecond rank. In the past 15 years the Navy has expanded rapidly and yet far\r\nless rapidly than our country. From now on reduced expenditures in the Navy\r\nmeans reduced military strength. The world's history has shown the\r\nimportance of sea power both for adequate defense and for the support of\r\nimportant and definite policies.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of attending this autumn a mobilization of the Atlantic\r\nFleet, and was glad to observe and note the preparedness of the fleet for\r\ninstant action. The review brought before the President and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy a greater and more powerful collection of vessels than had ever\r\nbeen gathered in American waters. The condition of the fleet and of the\r\nofficers and enlisted men and of the equipment of the vessels entitled\r\nthose in authority to the greatest credit.\r\n\r\nI again commend to Congress the giving of legislative sanction to the\r\nappointment of the naval aids to the Secretary of the Navy. These aids and\r\nthe council of aids appointed by the Secretary of the Navy to assist him in\r\nthe conduct of his department have proven to be of the highest utility.\r\nThey have furnished an executive committee of the most skilled naval\r\nexperts, who have coordinated the action of the various bureaus in the\r\nNavy, and by their advice have enabled the Secretary to give an\r\nadministration at the same time economical and most efficient. Never before\r\nhas the United States had a Navy that compared in efficiency with its\r\npresent one, but never before have the requirements with respect to naval\r\nwarfare been higher and more exacting than now. A year ago Congress refused\r\nto appropriate for more than one battleship. In this I think a great\r\nmistake of policy was made, and I urgently recommend that this Congress\r\nmake up for the mistake of the last session by appropriations authorizing\r\nthe construction of three battleships, in addition to destroyers, fuel\r\nships, and the other auxiliary vessels as shown in the building program of\r\nthe general board. We are confronted by a condition in respect to the\r\nnavies of the world which requires us, if we would maintain our Navy as an\r\ninsurance of peace, to augment our naval force by at least two battleships\r\na year and by battle cruisers, gunboats, torpedo destroyers, and submarine\r\nboats in a proper proportion. We have no desire for war. We would go as far\r\nas any nation in the world to avoid war, but we are a world power. Our\r\npopulation, our wealth, our definite policies, our responsibilities in the\r\nPacific and the Atlantic, our defense of the Panama Canal, together with\r\nour enormous world trade and our missionary outposts on the frontiers of\r\ncivilization, require us to recognize our position as one of the foremost\r\nin the family of nations, and to clothe ourselves with sufficient naval\r\npower to give force to our reasonable demands, and to give weight to our\r\ninfluence in those directions of progress that a powerful Christian nation\r\nshould advocate.\r\n\r\nI observe that the Secretary of the Navy devotes some space to a change in\r\nthe disciplinary system in vogue in that branch of the service. I think\r\nthere is nothing quite so unsatisfactory to either the Army or the Navy as\r\nthe severe punishments necessarily inflicted by court-martial for\r\ndesertions and purely military offenses, and I am glad to hear that the\r\nBritish have solved this important and difficult matter in a satisfactory\r\nway. I commend to the consideration of Congress the details of the new\r\ndisciplinary system, and recommend that laws be passed putting the same\r\ninto force both in the Army and the Navy.\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to that part of the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy in which he recommends the formation of a naval\r\nreserve by the organization of the ex-sailors of the Navy.\r\n\r\nI repeat my recommendation made last year that proper provision should be\r\nmade for the rank of the commander in chief of the squadrons and fleets of\r\nthe Navy. The inconvenience attending the necessary precedence that most\r\nforeign admirals have over our own whenever they meet in official functions\r\nought to be avoided. It impairs the prestige of our Navy and is a defect\r\nthat can be very easily removed.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThis department has been very active in the enforcement of the law. It has\r\nbeen better organized and with a larger force than ever before in the\r\nhistory of the Government. The prosecutions which have been successfully\r\nconcluded and which are now pending testify to the effectiveness of the\r\ndepartmental work.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of trusts under the Sherman antitrust law has gone on\r\nwithout restraint or diminution, and decrees similar to those entered in\r\nthe Standard Oil and the Tobacco cases have been entered in other suits,\r\nlike the suits against the Powder Trust and the Bathtub Trust. I am very\r\nstrongly convinced that a steady, consistent course in this regard, with a\r\ncontinuing of Supreme Court decisions upon new phases of the trust question\r\nnot already finally decided is going to offer a solution of this\r\nmuch-discussed and troublesome issue in a quiet, calm, and judicial way,\r\nwithout any radical legislation changing the governmental policy in regard\r\nto combinations now denounced by the Sherman antitrust law. I have already\r\nrecommended as an aid in this matter legislation which would declare\r\nunlawful certain well-known phases of unfair competition in interstate\r\ntrade, and I have also advocated voluntary national incorporation for the\r\nlarger industrial enterprises, with provision for a closer supervision by\r\nthe Bureau of Corporations, or a board appointed for the purpose, so as to\r\nmake more certain compliance with the antitrust law on the one hand and to\r\ngive greater security to the stockholders against possible prosecutions on\r\nthe other. I believe, however, that the orderly course of litigation in the\r\ncourts and the regular prosecution of trusts charged with the violation of\r\nthe antitrust law is producing among business men a clearer and clearer\r\nperception of the line of distinction between business that is to be\r\nencouraged and business that is to be condemned, and that in this quiet way\r\nthe question of trusts can be settled and competition retained as an\r\neconomic force to secure reasonableness in prices and freedom and\r\nindependence in trade.\r\n\r\nREFORM OF COURT PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nI am glad to bring to the attention of Congress the fact that the Supreme\r\nCourt has radically altered the equity rules governing the procedure on the\r\nequity side of all Federal courts, and though, as these changes have not\r\nbeen yet put in practice so as to enable us to state from actual results\r\nwhat the reform will accomplish, they are of such a character that we can\r\nreasonably prophesy that they will greatly reduce the time and cost of\r\nlitigation in such courts. The court has adopted many of the shorter\r\nmethods of the present English procedure, and while it may take a little\r\nwhile for the profession to accustom itself to these methods, it is certain\r\ngreatly to facilitate litigation. The action of the Supreme Court has been\r\nso drastic and so full of appreciation of the necessity for a great reform\r\nin court procedure that I have no hesitation in following up this action\r\nwith a recommendation which I foreshadowed in my message of three years\r\nago, that the sections of the statute governing the procedure in the\r\nFederal courts on the common-law side should be so amended as to give to\r\nthe Supreme Court the same right to make rules of procedure in common law\r\nas they have, since the beginning of the court, exercised in equity. I do\r\nnot doubt that a full consideration of the subject will enable the court\r\nwhile giving effect to the substantial differences in right and remedy\r\nbetween the system of common law and the system of equity so to unite the\r\ntwo procedures into the form of one civil action and to shorten the\r\nprocedure in such civil action as to furnish a model to all the State\r\ncourts exercising concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts of first\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nUnder the statute now in force the common-law procedure in each Federal\r\ncourt is made to conform to the procedure in the State in which the court\r\nis held. In these days, when we should be making progress in court\r\nprocedure, such a conformity statute makes the Federal method too dependent\r\nupon the action of State legislatures. I can but think it a great\r\nopportunity for Congress to intrust to the highest tribunal in this\r\ncountry, evidently imbued with a strong spirit in favor of a reform of\r\nprocedure, the power to frame a model code of procedure, which, while\r\npreserving all that is valuable and necessary of the rights and remedies at\r\ncommon law and in equity, shall lessen the burden of the poor litigant to a\r\nminimum in the expedition and cheapness with which his cause can be fought\r\nor defended through Federal courts to final judgment.\r\n\r\nWORKMAN'S COMPENSATION ACT\r\n\r\nThe workman's compensation act reported by the special commission appointed\r\nby Congress and the Executive, which passed the Senate and is now pending\r\nin the House, the passage of which I have in previous messages urged upon\r\nCongress, I venture again to call to its attention. The opposition to it\r\nwhich developed in the Senate, but which was overcome by a majority in that\r\nbody, seemed to me to grow out rather of a misapprehension of its effect\r\nthan of opposition to its principle. I say again that I think no act can\r\nhave a better effect directly upon the relations between the employer and\r\nemployee than this act applying to railroads and common carriers of an\r\ninterstate character, and I am sure that the passage of the act would\r\ngreatly relieve the courts of the heaviest burden of litigation that they\r\nhave, and would enable them to dispatch other business with a speed never\r\nbefore attained in courts of justice in this country.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, December 19, 1912. To the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nThis is the third of a series of messages in which I have brought to the\r\nattention of the Congress the important transactions of the Government in\r\neach of its departments during the last year and have discussed needed\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nHEADS OF DEPARTMENTS SHOULD HAVE SEATS ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\nI recommend the adoption of legislation which shall make it the duty of\r\nheads of departments--the members of the President's Cabinet--at convenient\r\ntimes to attend the session of the House and the Senate, which shall\r\nprovide seats for them in each House, and give them the opportunity to take\r\npart in all discussions and to answer questions of which they have had due\r\nnotice. The rigid holding apart of the executive and the legislative\r\nbranches of this Government has not worked for the great advantage of\r\neither. There has been much lost motion in the machinery, due to the lack\r\nof cooperation and interchange of views face to face between the\r\nrepresentatives of the Executive and the Members of the two legislative\r\nbranches of the Government. It was never intended that they should be\r\nseparated in the sense of not being in constant effective touch and\r\nrelationship to each other. The legislative and the executive each performs\r\nits own appropriate function, but these functions must be coordinated. Time\r\nand time again debates have arisen in each House upon issues which the\r\ninformation of a particular department head would have enabled him, if\r\npresent, to end at once by a simple explanation or statement. Time and time\r\nagain a forceful and earnest presentation of facts and arguments by the\r\nrepresentative of the Executive whose duty it is to enforce the law would\r\nhave brought about a useful reform by amendment, which in the absence of\r\nsuch a statement has failed of passage. I do not think I am mistaken in\r\nsaying that the presence of the members of the Cabinet on the floor of each\r\nHouse would greatly contribute to the enactment of beneficial legislation.\r\nNor would this in any degree deprive either the legislative or the\r\nexecutive of the independence which separation of the two branches has been\r\nintended to promote. It would only facilitate their cooperation in the\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am sure that the necessity and duty imposed upon\r\ndepartment heads of appearing in each house and in answer to searching\r\nquestions, of rendering upon their feet an account of what they have done,\r\nor what has been done by the administration, will spur each member of the\r\nCabinet to closer attention to the details of his department, to greater\r\nfamiliarity with its needs, and to greater care to avoid the just criticism\r\nwhich the answers brought out in questions put and discussions arising\r\nbetween the Members of either House and the members of the Cabinet may\r\nproperly evoke.\r\n\r\nObjection is made that the members of the administration having no vote\r\ncould exercise no power on the floor of the House, and could not assume\r\nthat attitude of authority and control which the English parliamentary\r\nGovernment have and which enables them to meet the responsibilities the\r\nEnglish system thrusts upon them. I agree that in certain respects it would\r\nbe more satisfactory if members of the Cabinet could at the same time be\r\nMembers of both Houses, with voting power, but this is impossible under our\r\nsystem; and while a lack of this feature may detract from the influence of\r\nthe department chiefs, it will not prevent the good results which I have\r\ndescribed above both in the matter of legislation and in the matter of\r\nadministration. The enactment of such a law would be quite within the power\r\nof Congress without constitutional amendment, and it has such possibilities\r\nof usefulness that we might well make the experiment, and if we are\r\ndisappointed the misstep can be easily retraced by a repeal of the enabling\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new proposition. In the House of Representatives, in the\r\nThirty-eighth Congress, the proposition was referred to a select committee\r\nof seven Members. The committee made an extensive report, and urged the\r\nadoption of the reform. The report showed that our history had not been\r\nwithout illustration of the necessity and the examples of the practice by\r\npointing out that in early days Secretaries were repeatedly called to the\r\npresence of either Rouse for consultation, advice, and information. It also\r\nreferred to remarks of Mr. justice Story in his Commentaries on the\r\nConstitution, in which he urgently presented the wisdom of such a change.\r\nThis report is to be found in Volume I of the Reports of Committees of the\r\nFirst Session of the Thirty-eighth Congress, April 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nAgain, on February 4, 1881, a select committee of the Senate recommended\r\nthe passage of a similar bill, and made a report, In which, while approving\r\nthe separation of the three branches, the executive, legislative, and\r\njudicial, they point out as a reason for the proposed change that, although\r\nhaving a separate existence, the branches are \"to cooperate, each with the\r\nother, as the different members of the human body must cooperate, with each\r\nother in order to form the figure and perform the duties of a perfect\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nThe report concluded as follows: This system will require the selection of\r\nthe strongest men to be heads of departments and will require them to be\r\nwell equipped with the knowledge of their offices. It will also require the\r\nstrongest men to be the leaders of Congress and participate in debate. It\r\nwill bring these strong men in contact, perhaps into conflict, to advance\r\nthe public weal, and thus stimulate their abilities and their efforts, and\r\nwill thus assuredly result to the good of the country.\r\n\r\nIf it should appear by actual experience that the heads of departments in\r\nfact have not time to perform the additional duty imposed on them by this\r\nbill, the force in their offices should be increased or the duties\r\ndevolving on them personally should be diminished. An undersecretary should\r\nbe appointed to whom could be confided that routine of administration which\r\nrequires only order and accuracy. The principal officers could then confine\r\ntheir attention to those duties which require wise discretion and\r\nintellectual activity. Thus they would have abundance of time for their\r\nduties under this bill. Indeed, your committee believes that the public\r\ninterest would be subserved if the Secretaries were relieved of the\r\nharassing cares of distributing clerkships and closely supervising the mere\r\nmachinery of the departments. Your committee believes that the adoption of\r\nthis bill and the effective execution of its provisions will be the first\r\nstep toward a sound civil-service reform which will secure a larger wisdom\r\nin the adoption of policies and a better system in their execution.(Signed)\r\nGEO.

It would be difficult\r\nto mention the names of higher authority in the practical knowledge of our\r\nGovernment than those which are appended to this report.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL SAVINGS BANK SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe Postal Savings Bank System has been extended so that it now includes\r\n4,004 fourth-class post offices', as well as 645 branch offices and\r\nstations in the larger cities. There are now 12,812 depositories at which\r\npatrons of the system may open accounts. The number of depositors is\r\n300,000 and the amount of their deposits is approximately $28,000,000, not\r\nincluding $1,314,140 which has been with drawn by depositors for the\r\npurpose of buying postal savings bonds. Experience demonstrates the value\r\nof dispensing with the pass-book and introducing in its place a certificate\r\nof deposit. The gross income of the postal savings system for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1913, will amount to $700,000 and the interest payable\r\nto depositors to $300,000. The cost of supplies, equipment, and salaries is\r\n$700,000. It thus appears that the system lacks $300,000 a year of paying\r\ninterest and expenses. It is estimated, however, that when the deposits\r\nhave reached the sum Of $50,000,000, which at the present rate they soon\r\nwill do, the system will be self-sustaining. By law the postal savings\r\nfunds deposited at each post office are required to be redeposited in local\r\nbanks. State and national banks to the number of 7,357 have qualified as\r\ndepositories for these funds. Such deposits are secured by bonds\r\naggregating $54,000,000. Of this amount, $37,000,000 represent municipal\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nPARCEL POST\r\n\r\nIn several messages I have favored and recommended the adoption of a system\r\nof parcel post. In the postal appropriation act of last year a general\r\nsystem was provided and its installation was directed by the 1st of\r\nJanuary. This has entailed upon the Post Office Department a great deal of\r\nvery heavy labor, but the Postmaster General informs me that on the date\r\nselected, to wit, the 1st of January, near at hand, the department will be\r\nin readiness to meet successfully the requirements of the public.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF POSTMASTERS\r\n\r\nA trial, during the past three years, of the system of classifying\r\nfourth-class postmasters in that part of the country lying between the\r\nMississippi River on the west, Canada on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on\r\nthe east, and Mason and Dixon's line on the south has been sufficiently\r\nsatisfactory to justify the postal authorities in recommending the\r\nextension of the order to include all the fourth-class postmasters in the\r\ncountry. In September, 1912, upon the suggestion of the Postmaster General,\r\nI directed him to prepare an order which should put the system in effect,\r\nexcept in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and Samoa. Under date of\r\nOctober 15 I issued such an order which affected 36,000 postmasters. By the\r\norder the post offices were divided into groups A and B. Group A includes\r\nall postmasters whose compensation is $500 or more, and group B those whose\r\ncompensation is less than that sum. Different methods are pursued in the\r\nselection of the postmasters for group A and group, B. Criticism has been\r\nmade of this order on the ground that the motive for it was political.\r\nNothing could be further from the truth. The order was made before the\r\nelection and in the interest of efficient public service. I have several\r\ntimes requested Congress to give me authority to put first-, second-, and\r\nthird-class postmasters, and all other local officers, including\r\ninternal-revenue officers, customs officers, United States marshals, and\r\nthe local agents of the other departments under the classification of the\r\ncivil-service law by taking away the necessity for confirming such\r\nappointments by the Senate. I deeply regret the failure of Congress to\r\nfollow these recommendations. The change would have taken out of politics\r\npractically every local officer and would have entirely cured the evils\r\ngrowing out of what under the present law must always remain a remnant of\r\nthe spoils system.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION TO RAILWAYS FOR CARRYING MAILS\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the establishment of a parcel post on January 1st will\r\nlargely increase the amount of mail matter to be transported by the\r\nrailways, and Congress should be prompt to provide a way by which they may\r\nreceive the additional compensation to which they will be entitled. The\r\nPostmaster General urges that the department's plan for a complete\r\nreadjustment of the system of paying the railways for carrying the mails be\r\nadopted, substituting space for weight as the principal factor in fixing\r\ncompensation. Under this plan it will be possible to determine without\r\ndelay what additional payment should be made on account of the parcel post.\r\nThe Postmaster General's recommendation is based on the results of a\r\nfar-reaching investigation begun early in the administration with the\r\nobject of determining what it costs the railways to carry the mails. The\r\nstatistics obtained during the course of the inquiry show that while many\r\nof the railways, and particularly the large systems, were making profits\r\nfrom mail transportations, certain of the lines were actually carrying the\r\nmails at a loss. As a result of the investigation the department, after\r\ngiving the subject careful consideration, decided to urge the abandonment\r\nof the present plan of fixing compensation on the basis of the weight of\r\nthe mails carried, a plan that has proved to be exceedingly expensive and\r\nin other respects unsatisfactory. Under the method proposed the railway\r\ncompanies will annually submit to the department reports showing what it\r\ncosts them to carry the mails, and this cost will be apportioned on the\r\nbasis of the car space engaged, payment to be allowed at the rate thus\r\ndetermined in amounts that will cover the cost and a reasonable profit. If\r\na railway is not satisfied with the manner in which the department\r\napportions the cost in fixing compensation, it is to have the right, tinder\r\nthe new plan, of appealing to the Interstate Commerce Commission. This\r\nfeature of the proposed law would seem to insure a fair treatment of the\r\nrailways. It is hoped that Congress will give the matter immediate\r\nattention and that the method of compensation recommended by the department\r\nor some other suitable plan will be promptly authorized.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\nThe Interior Department, in the problems of administration included within\r\nits jurisdiction, presents more difficult questions than any other. This\r\nhas been due perhaps to temporary causes of a political character, but more\r\nespecially to the inherent difficulty in the performance of some of the\r\nfunctions which are assigned to it. Its chief duty is the guardianship of\r\nthe public domain and the disposition of that domain to private ownership\r\nunder homestead, mining, and other laws, by which patents from the\r\nGovernment to the individual are authorized on certain conditions. During\r\nthe last decade the public seemed to become suddenly aware that a very\r\nlarge part of its domain had passed from its control into private\r\nownership, under laws not well adapted to modern conditions, and also that\r\nin the doing of this the provisions of existing law and regulations adopted\r\nin accordance with law had not been strictly observed, and that in the\r\ntransfer of title much fraud had intervened, to the pecuniary benefit of\r\ndishonest persons. There arose thereupon a demand for conservation of the\r\npublic domain, its protection against fraudulent diminution, and the\r\npreservation of that part of it from private acquisition which it seemed\r\nnecessary to keep for future public use. The movement, excellent in the\r\nintention which prompted it, and useful in its results, has nevertheless\r\nhad some bad effects, which the western country has recently been feeling\r\nand in respect of which there is danger of a reaction toward older abuses\r\nunless we can attain the golden mean, which consists in the prevention of\r\nthe mere exploitation of the public domain for private purposes while at\r\nthe same, time facilitating its development for the benefit of the local\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe land laws need complete revision to secure proper conservation on the\r\none hand of land that ought to be kept in public use and, on the other\r\nhand, prompt disposition of those lands which ought to be disposed in\r\nprivate ownership or turned over to private use by properly guarded leases.\r\nIn addition to this there are not enough officials in our Land Department\r\nwith legal knowledge sufficient promptly to make the decisions which are\r\ncalled for. The whole land-laws system should be reorganized, and not until\r\nit is reorganized, will decisions be made as promptly as they ought, or\r\nwill men who have earned title to public land under the statute receive\r\ntheir patents within a reasonably short period. The present administration\r\nhas done what it could in this regard, but the necessity for reform and\r\nchange by a revision of the laws and an increase and reorganization of the\r\nforce remains, and I submit to Congress the wisdom of a full examination of\r\nthis subject, in order that a very large and important part of our people\r\nin the West may be relieved from a just cause of irritation.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the discussion by the Secretary of the Interior\r\nof the need for legislation with respect to mining claims, leases of coal\r\nlands in this country and in Alaska, and for similar disposition of oil,\r\nphosphate, and potash lands, and also to his discussion of the proper use\r\nto be made of water-power sites held by the Government. Many of these lands\r\nare now being withheld from use by the public under the general withdrawal\r\nact which was passed by the last Congress. That act was not for the purpose\r\nof disposing of the question, but it was for the purpose of preserving the\r\nlands until the question could be solved. I earnestly urge that the matter\r\nis of the highest importance to our western fellow citizens and ought to\r\ncommand the immediate attention of the legislative branch of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAnother function which the Interior Department has to perform is that of\r\nthe guardianship of Indians. In spite of everything which has been said in\r\ncriticism of the policy of our Government toward the Indians, the amount of\r\nwealth which is now held by it for these wards per capita shows that the\r\nGovernment has been generous; but the management of so large an estate,\r\nwith the great variety of circumstances that surround each tribe and each\r\ncase, calls for the exercise of the highest business discretion, and the\r\nmachinery provided in the Indian Bureau for the discharge of this function\r\nis entirely inadequate. The position of Indian commissioner demands the\r\nexercise of business ability of the first order, and it is difficult to\r\nsecure such talent for the salary provided.\r\n\r\nThe condition of health of the Indian and the prevalence in the tribes of\r\ncurable diseases has been exploited recently in the press. In a message to\r\nCongress at its last session I brought this subject to its attention and\r\ninvited a special appropriation, in order that our facilities for\r\novercoming diseases among the Indians might be properly increased, but no\r\naction was then taken by Congress on the subject, nor has such\r\nappropriation been made since.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by authority of the Congress to report on proper\r\nmethod of securing railroad development in Alaska is formulating its\r\nreport, and I expect to have an opportunity before the end of this session\r\nto submit its recommendations.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe far-reaching utility of the educational system carried on by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture for the benefit of the farmers of our country\r\ncalls for no elaboration. Each year there is a growth in the variety of\r\nfacts which it brings out for the benefit of the farmer, and each year\r\nconfirms the wisdom of the expenditure of the appropriations made for that\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nPURE-FOOD LAW\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is charged with the execution of the\r\npure-food law. The passage of this encountered much opposition from\r\nmanufacturers and others who feared the effect upon their business of the\r\nenforcement of its provisions. The opposition aroused the just indignation\r\nof the public, and led to an intense sympathy with the severe and rigid\r\nenforcement of the provisions of the new law. It had to deal in many\r\ninstances with the question whether or not products of large business\r\nenterprises, in the form of food preparations, were deleterious to the\r\npublic health; and while in a great majority of instances this issue was\r\neasily determinable, there were not a few cases in which it was hard to\r\ndraw the line between a useful and a harmful food preparation. In cases\r\nlike this when a decision involved the destruction of great business\r\nenterprises representing the investment of large capital and the\r\nexpenditure of great energy and ability, the danger of serious injustice\r\nwas very considerable in the enforcement of a new law under the spur of\r\ngreat public indignation. The public officials charged with executing the\r\nlaw might do injustice in heated controversy through unconscious pride of\r\nopinion and obstinacy of conclusion. For this reason President Roosevelt\r\nfelt justified in creating a board of experts, known as the Remsen Board,\r\nto whom in cases of much importance an appeal might be taken and a review\r\nhad of a decision of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Agricultural\r\nDepartment. I heartily agree that it was wise to create this board in order\r\nthat injustice might not be done. The questions which arise are not\r\ngenerally those involving palpable injury to health, but they are upon the\r\nnarrow and doubtful line in respect of which it is better to be in some\r\nerror not dangerous than to be radically destructive. I think that the time\r\nhas come for Congress to recognize the necessity for some such tribunal of\r\nappeal and to make specific statutory provision for it. While we are\r\nstruggling to suppress an evil of great proportions like that of impure\r\nfood, we must provide machinery in the law itself to prevent its becoming\r\nan instrument of oppression, and we ought to enable those whose business is\r\nthreatened with annihilation to have some tribunal and some form of appeal\r\nin which they have a complete day in court.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL CREDITS\r\n\r\nI referred in my first message to the question of improving the system of\r\nagricultural credits. The Secretary of Agriculture has made an\r\ninvestigation into the matter of credits in this country, and I commend a\r\nconsideration of the information which through his agents he has been able\r\nto collect. It does not in any way minimize the importance of the proposal,\r\nbut it gives more accurate information upon some of the phases of the\r\nquestion than we have heretofore had.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR\r\n\r\nI commend to Congress an examination of the report of the Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Labor, and especially that part in which he discusses the\r\noffice of the Bureau of Corporations, the value to commerce of a proposed\r\ntrade commission, and the steps which he has taken to secure the\r\norganization of a national chamber of commerce. I heartily commend his view\r\nthat the plan of a trade commission which looks to the fixing of prices is\r\naltogether impractical and ought not for a moment to be considered as a\r\npossible solution of the trust question.\r\n\r\nThe trust question in the enforcement of the Sherman antitrust law is\r\ngradually solving itself, is maintaining the principle and restoring the\r\npractice of competition, and if the law is quietly but firmly enforced,\r\nbusiness will adjust itself to the statutory requirements, and the unrest\r\nin commercial circles provoked by the trust discussion will disappear.\r\n\r\nPANAMA-PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a joint resolution of Congress, an Executive\r\nproclamation was issued last February, inviting the nations of the world to\r\nparticipate in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition to be held at\r\nSan Francisco to celebrate the construction of the Panama, Canal. A\r\nsympathetic response was immediately forthcoming, and several nations have\r\nalready selected the sites for their buildings. In furtherance of my\r\ninvitation, a special commission visited European countries during the past\r\nsummer, and received assurance of hearty cooperation in the task of\r\nbringing together a universal industrial, military, and naval display on an\r\nunprecedented scale. It is evident that the exposition will be an accurate\r\nmirror of the world's activities as they appear 400 years after the date of\r\nthe discovery of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the United States to make the nations welcome at San\r\nFrancisco and to facilitate such acquaintance between them and ourselves as\r\nwill promote the expansion of commerce and familiarize the world with the\r\nnew trade route through the Panama Canal. The action of the State\r\ngovernments and individuals assures a comprehensive exhibit of the\r\nresources of this country and of the progress of the people. This\r\nparticipation by State and individuals should be supplemented by an\r\nadequate showing of the varied and unique activities of the National\r\nGovernment. The United States can not with good grace invite foreign\r\ngovernments to erect buildings and make expensive exhibits while itself\r\nrefusing to participate. Nor would it be wise to forego the opportunity to\r\njoin with other nations in the inspiring interchange of ideas tending to\r\npromote intercourse, friendship, and commerce. It is the duty of the\r\nGovernment to foster and build up commerce through the canal, just as it\r\nwas the duty of the Government to construct it.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend the appropriation at this session of such a sum as\r\nwill enable the United States to construct a suitable building, install a\r\ngovernmental exhibit, and otherwise participate in the Panama-Pacific\r\nInternational Exposition in a manner commensurate with the dignity of a\r\nnation whose guests are to be the people of the world. I recommend also\r\nsuch legislation as will facilitate the entry of material intended for\r\nexhibition and protect foreign exhibitors against infringement of patents\r\nand the unauthorized copying of patterns and designs. All aliens sent to\r\nSan Francisco to construct and care for foreign buildings and exhibits\r\nshould be admitted without restraint or embarrassment.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE CITY OF WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington is a beautiful city, with a population of 352,936,\r\nof whom 98,667 are colored. The annual municipal budget is about\r\n$14,000,000. The presence of the National Capital and other governmental\r\nstructures constitutes the chief beauty and interest of the city. The\r\npublic grounds are extensive, and the opportunities for improving the city\r\nand making it still more attractive are very great. Under a plan adopted\r\nsome years ago, one half the cost of running the city is paid by taxation\r\nupon the property, real and personal, of the citizens and residents, and\r\nthe other half is borne by the General Government. The city is expanding at\r\na remarkable rate, and this can only be accounted for by the coming here\r\nfrom other parts of the country of well-to-do people who, having finished\r\ntheir business careers elsewhere, build and make this their permanent place\r\nof residence.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the city as a municipality is very well governed. It is well\r\nlighted, the water supply is good, the streets are well paved, the police\r\nforce is well disciplined, crime is not flagrant, and while it has purlieus\r\nand centers of vice, like other large cities, they are not exploited, they\r\ndo not exercise any influence or control in the government of the city, and\r\nthey are suppressed in as far as it has been found practicable. Municipal\r\ngraft is inconsiderable. There are interior courts in the city that are\r\nnoisome and centers of disease and the refuge of criminals, but Congress\r\nhas begun to clean these out, and progress has been made in the case of the\r\nmost notorious of these, which is known as \"Willow Tree Alley.\" This\r\nmovement should continue.\r\n\r\nThe mortality for the past year was at the rate Of 17.80 per 1,000 of both\r\nraces; among the whites it was 14.61 per thousand, and among the blacks\r\n26.12 per thousand. These are the lowest mortality rates ever recorded in\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\nOne of the most crying needs in the government of the District is a\r\ntribunal or public authority for the purpose of supervising the\r\ncorporations engaged in the operation of public utilities. Such a bill is\r\npending in Congress and ought to pass. Washington should show itself under\r\nthe direction of Congress to be a city with a model form of government, but\r\nas long as such authority over public utilities is withheld from the\r\nmunicipal government, it must always be defective.\r\n\r\nWithout undue criticism of the present street railway accommodations, it\r\ncan be truly said that under the spur of a public utilities commission they\r\nmight be substantially improved.\r\n\r\nWhile the school system of Washington perhaps might be bettered in the\r\neconomy of its management and the distribution of its buildings, its\r\nusefulness has nevertheless greatly increased in recent years, and it now\r\noffers excellent facilities for primary and secondary education.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there is considerable agitation in Washington in favor of\r\ngranting the citizens of the city the franchise and constituting an\r\nelective government. I am strongly opposed to this change. The history of\r\nWashington discloses a number of experiments of this kind, which have\r\nalways been abandoned as unsatisfactory. The truth is this is a city\r\ngoverned by a popular body, to wit, the Congress of the United States,\r\nselected from the people of the United States, who own Washington. The\r\npeople who come here to live do so with the knowledge of the origin of the\r\ncity and the restrictions, and therefore voluntarily give up the privilege\r\nof living in a municipality governed by popular vote. Washington is so\r\nunique in its origin and in its use for housing and localizing the\r\nsovereignty of the Nation that the people who live here must regard its\r\npeculiar character and must be content to subject themselves to the control\r\nof a body selected by all the people of the Nation. I agree that there are\r\ncertain inconveniences growing out of the government of a city by a\r\nnational legislature like Congress, and it would perhaps be possible to\r\nlessen these by the delegation by Congress to the District Commissioners of\r\ngreater legislative power for the enactment of local laws than they now\r\npossess, especially those of a police character.\r\n\r\nEvery loyal American has a personal pride in the beauty of Washington and\r\nin its development and growth. There is no one with a proper appreciation\r\nof our Capital City who would favor a niggardly policy in respect to\r\nexpenditures from the National Treasury to add to the attractiveness of\r\nthis city, which belongs to every citizen of the entire country, and which\r\nno citizen visits without a sense of pride of ownership. We have had\r\nrestored by a Commission of Fine Arts, at the instance of a committee of\r\nthe Senate, the original plan of the French engineer L'Enfant for the city\r\nof Washington, and we know with great certainty the course which the\r\nimprovement of Washington should take. Why should there be delay in making\r\nthis improvement in so far as it involves the extension of the parking\r\nsystem and the construction of greatly needed public buildings?\r\nAppropriate buildings for the State Department, the Department of justice,\r\nand the Department of Commerce and Labor have been projected, plans have\r\nbeen approved, and nothing is wanting but the appropriations for the\r\nbeginning and completion of the structures. A hall of archives is also\r\nbadly needed, but nothing has been done toward its construction, although\r\nthe land for it has long been bought and paid for. Plans have been made for\r\nthe union of Potomac Park with the valley of Rock Creek and Rock Creek\r\nPark, and the necessity for the connection between the Soldiers' Home and\r\nRock Creek Park calls for no comment. I ask again why there should be delay\r\nin carrying out these plans We have the money in the Treasury, the plans\r\nare national in their scope, and the improvement should be treated as a\r\nnational project. The plan will find a hearty approval throughout the\r\ncountry. I am quite sure, from the information which I have, that, at\r\ncomparatively small expense, from that part of the District of Columbia\r\nwhich was retroceded to Virginia, the portion including the Arlington\r\nestate, Fort Myer, and the palisades of the Potomac can be acquired by\r\npurchase and the jurisdiction of the State of Virginia over this land ceded\r\nto the Nation. This ought to be done.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Lincoln Memorial and of a memorial bridge from the\r\nbase of the Lincoln Monument to Arlington would be an appropriate and\r\nsymbolic expression of the union of the North and the South at the Capital\r\nof the Nation. I urge upon Congress the appointment of a commission to\r\nundertake these national improvements, and to submit a plan for their\r\nexecution; and when the plan has been submitted and approved, and the work\r\ncarried out, Washington will really become what it ought to be--the most\r\nbeautiful city in the world.",
