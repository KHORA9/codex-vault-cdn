LAMSON,\r\n\r\n_A GENEROUS FRIEND OF LEARNING._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the EPOCHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY aims to follow out the\r\nprinciples laid down for \"THE COLONIES,\"--the study of causes rather than\r\nof events, the development of the American nation out of scattered and\r\ninharmonious colonies. The throwing off of English control, the growth out\r\nof narrow political conditions, the struggle against foreign domination,\r\nand the extension of popular government, are all parts of the\r\nuninterrupted process of the Formation of the Union.\r\n\r\nSo mighty a development can be treated only in its elements in this small\r\nvolume. Much matter is thrown into graphic form in the maps; the\r\nSuggestions for Readers and Teachers, and the bibliographies at the heads\r\nof the chapters are meant to lead to more detailed accounts, both of\r\nevents and of social and economic conditions. Although the book includes\r\nthree serious wars, there is no military history in it. To the soldier,\r\nthe movement of troops is a professional question of great significance;\r\nthe layman needs to know, rather, what were the means, the character, and\r\nthe spirit of the two combatants in each case, and why one succeeded where\r\nthe other was defeated.\r\n\r\nTo my colleague, Professor Edward Channing, I am indebted for many\r\nsuggestions on the first four chapters.\r\n\r\nALBERT BUSHNELL HART.\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 1, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the five years since this volume of the _Epochs of American\r\nHistory_ was first issued, the literature of the subject has made\r\nconstant advances; and hence the Suggestions for Readers and Teachers and\r\nthe bibliographies at the head of each chapter have been pruned, enlarged,\r\nand rewritten. The text has undergone fewer changes. The good-will of\r\nusers of the book has pointed out some errors and inaccuracies, which have\r\nbeen corrected from time to time; and new light has in some cases dawned\r\nupon the author. I shall always be grateful for corrections of fact or of\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nALBERT BUSHNELL HART\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 1, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR READERS AND TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the volumes in the series is intended to be complete in itself,\r\nand to furnish an account of the period it covers sufficient for the\r\ngeneral reader or student. Those who wish to supplement this book by\r\nadditional reading or study will find useful the bibliographies at the\r\nheads of the chapters.\r\n\r\nFor the use of teachers the following method is recommended. A chapter at\r\na time may be given out to the class for their preliminary reading, or the\r\nparagraph numbers may be used in assigning lessons. From the references at\r\nthe head of the chapter a report may then be prepared by one or more\r\nmembers of the class on each of the numbered sections included in that\r\nchapter; these reports may be filed, or may be read in class when the\r\ntopic is reached in the more detailed exercises. Pupils take a singular\r\ninterest in such work, and the details thus obtained will add a local\r\ncolor to the necessarily brief statements of the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDENTS' REFERENCE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following brief works will be found useful for reference and\r\ncomparison, or for the preparation of topics. The set should cost not more\r\nthan twelve dollars.

COLONIAL GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British America.]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the term \"Americans\" was commonly\r\napplied in England, and even the colonists themselves, to the English-\r\nspeaking subjects of Great Britain inhabiting the continent of North\r\nAmerica and the adjacent islands. The region thus occupied comprised the\r\nBahamas, the Bermudas, Jamaica, and some smaller West Indian islands,\r\nNewfoundland, the outlying dependency of Belize, the territory of the\r\ngreat trading corporation known as the Hudson's Bay Company, and--more\r\nimportant than all the rest--the broad strip of territory running along\r\nthe coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Altamaha River.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundaries.]\r\n\r\nIt is in this continental strip, lying between the sea and the main chain\r\nof the Appalachian range of mountains, that the formation of the Union was\r\naccomplished. The external boundaries of this important group of colonies\r\nwere undetermined; the region west of the mountains was drained by\r\ntributaries of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi rivers, and both these\r\nrivers were held in their lower course by the French. Four successive\r\ncolonial wars had not yet settled the important question of the\r\nterritorial rights of the two powers, and a fifth war was impending.\r\n\r\nSo far as the individual colonies were concerned, their boundaries were\r\nestablished for them by English grants. The old charters of Massachusetts,\r\nVirginia, and the Carolinas had given title to strips of territory\r\nextending from the Atlantic westward to the Pacific. Those charters had\r\nlapsed, and the only colony in 1750 of which the jurisdiction exercised\r\nunder the charter reached beyond the Appalachian mountains was\r\nPennsylvania. The Connecticut grant had long since been ignored; the\r\nPennsylvania limits included the strategic point where the Alleghany and\r\nMonongahela rivers unite to form the Ohio. Near this point began the final\r\nstruggle between the English and the French colonies. The interior\r\nboundaries between colonies in 1750 were matters of frequent dispute and\r\nlaw-suits. Such questions were eventually brought to the decision of the\r\nEnglish Privy Council, or remained to vex the new national government\r\nafter the Revolution had begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The frontiers.]\r\n\r\nAt this date, and indeed as late as the end of the Revolution, the\r\ncontinental colonies were all maritime. Each of them had sea-ports\r\nenjoying direct trade with Europe. The sea was the only national highway;\r\nthe sea-front was easily defensible. Between contiguous colonies there was\r\nintercourse; but Nova Scotia, the last of the continental colonies to be\r\nestablished, was looked upon as a sort of outlyer, and its history has\r\nlittle connection with the history of the thirteen colonies farther south.\r\nThe western frontier was a source of apprehension and of danger. In\r\nnorthern Maine, on the frontiers of New York, on the west and southwest,\r\nlived tribes of Indians, often disaffected, and sometimes hostile. Behind\r\nthem lay the French, hereditary enemies of the colonists. The natural\r\ntendency of the English was to push their frontier westward into the\r\nIndian and French belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE PEOPLE AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Population.]\r\n\r\nThis westward movement was not occasioned by the pressure of population.\r\nAll the colonies, except, perhaps, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Delaware,\r\nhad abundance of vacant and tillable land. The population in 1750 was\r\nabout 1,370,000. It ranged from less than 5,000 in Georgia to 240,000 in\r\nVirginia. Several strains of non-English white races were included in\r\nthese numbers. There were Dutch in New York, a few Swedes in Pennsylvania\r\nand New Jersey, Germans in New York and Pennsylvania, Scotch Irish and\r\nScotch Highlanders in the mountains of Pennsylvania and South Carolina, a\r\nfew Huguenots, especially in the South, and a few Irish and Jews. All the\r\nrest of the whites were English or the descendants of English. A slow\r\nstream of immigration poured into the colonies, chiefly from England.\r\nConvicts were no longer deported to be sold as private servants; but\r\nredemptioners--persons whose services were mortgaged for their passage--\r\nwere still abundant. Many years later, Washington writes to an agent\r\ninquiring about \"buying a ship-load of Germans,\" that is, of\r\nredemptioners. There was another important race-element,--the negroes,\r\nperhaps 220,000 in number; in South Carolina they far out-numbered the\r\nwhites. A brisk trade was carried on in their importation, and probably\r\nten thousand a year were brought into the country. This stream poured\r\nalmost entirely into the Southern colonies. North of Maryland the number\r\nof blacks was not significant in proportion to the total population. A few\r\nIndians were scattered among the white settlements, but they were an alien\r\ncommunity, and had no share in the development of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlements.]\r\n[Sidenote: American character.]\r\n\r\nThe population of 1,370,000 people occupied a space which in 1890\r\nfurnished homes for more than 25,000,000. The settlements as yet rested\r\nupon, or radiated from, the sea-coast and the watercourses; eight-tenths\r\nof the American people lived within easy reach of streams navigable to the\r\nsea. Settlements had crept up the Mohawk and Susquehanna valleys, but they\r\nwere still in the midst of the wilderness. Within each colony the people\r\nhad a feeling of common interest and brotherhood. Distant, outlying, and\r\nrebellious counties were infrequent. The Americans of 1750 were in\r\ncharacter very like the frontiersmen of to-day, they were accustomed to\r\nhard work, but equally accustomed to abundance of food and to a rude\r\ncomfort; they were tenacious of their rights, as became offshoots of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race. In dealing with their Indian neighbors and their slaves\r\nthey were masterful and relentless. In their relations with each other\r\nthey were accustomed to observe the limitations of the law. In deference\r\nto the representatives of authority, in respect for precedent and for the\r\nobservances of unwritten custom, they went beyond their descendants on the\r\nfrontier. Circumstances in America have greatly changed in a century and a\r\nhalf: the type of American character has changed less. The quieter,\r\nlonger-settled communities of that day are still fairly represented by\r\nsuch islands of undisturbed American life as Cape Cod and Cape Charles.\r\nThe industrious and thriving built good houses, raised good crops, sent\r\ntheir surplus abroad and bought English goods with it, went to church, and\r\ndiscussed politics. In education, in refinement, in literature and art,\r\nmost of the colonists had made about the same advance as the present\r\nfarmers of Utah. The rude, restless energy of modern America was not yet\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. INHERITED INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of American government.]\r\n\r\nIn comparison with other men of their time, the Americans were\r\ndistinguished by the possession of new political and social ideas, which\r\nwere destined to be the foundation of the American commonwealth. One of\r\nthe strongest and most persistent elements in national development has\r\nbeen that inheritance of political traditions and usages which the new\r\nsettlers brought with them. Among the more rigid sects of New England the\r\nexample of the Hebrew theocracy, as set forth in the Scriptures, had great\r\ninfluence on government; they were even more powerfully affected by the\r\nideas of the Christian commonwealth held by the Protestant theologians,\r\nand particularly by John Calvin. The residence of the Plymouth settlers in\r\nthe Netherlands, and the later conquest of the Dutch colonies, had brought\r\nthe Americans into contact with the singularly wise and free institutions\r\nof the Dutch. To some degree the colonial conception of government had\r\nbeen affected by the English Commonwealth of 1649, and the English\r\nRevolution of 1688. The chief source of the political institutions of the\r\ncolonies was everywhere the institutions with which they were familiar at\r\nthe time of the emigration from England. It is not accurate to assert that\r\nAmerican government is the offspring of English government. It is nearer\r\nthe truth to say that in the middle of the seventeenth century the Anglo-\r\nSaxon race divided into two branches, each of which developed in its own\r\nway the institutions which it received from the parent stock. From the\r\nfoundation of the colonies to 1789 the development of English government\r\nhad little influence on colonial government. So long as the colonies were\r\ndependent they were subject to English regulation and English legal\r\ndecisions, but their institutions developed in a very different direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political ideas.]\r\n\r\nCertain fundamental political ideas were common to the older and the\r\nyounger branches of the Anglo-Saxon race, and have remained common to this\r\nday. The first was the idea of the supremacy of law, the conception that a\r\nstatute was binding on the subject, on the members of the legislative\r\nbody, and even on the sovereign. The people on both sides of the water\r\nwere accustomed to an orderly government, in which laws were made and\r\nadministered with regularity and dignity. The next force was the\r\nconception of an unwritten law, of the binding power of custom. This idea,\r\nalthough by no means peculiar to the English race, had been developed into\r\nan elaborate \"common law,\"--a system of legal principles accepted as\r\nbinding on subject and on prince, even without a positive statute. Out of\r\nthese two underlying principles of law had gradually developed a third\r\nprinciple, destined to be of incalculable force in modern governments,--\r\nthe conception of a superior law, higher even than the law-making body. In\r\nEngland there was no written constitution, but there was a succession of\r\ngrants or charters, in which certain rights were assured to the\r\nindividual. The long struggle with the Stuart dynasty in the seventeenth\r\ncentury was an assertion of these rights as against the Crown. In the\r\ncolonies during the same time those rights were asserted against all\r\ncomers,--against the colonial governors, against the sovereign, and\r\nagainst Parliament. The original colonies were almost all founded on\r\ncharters, specific grants which gave them territory and directed in what\r\nmanner they should carry on government therein. These charters were held\r\nby the colonists to be irrevocable except for cause shown to the\r\nsatisfaction of a court of law; and it was a recognized right of the\r\nindividual to plead that a colonial law was void because contrary to the\r\ncharter. Most of the grants had lapsed or had been forcibly, and even\r\nillegally, annulled; but the principle still remained that a law was\r\nsuperior to the will of the ruler, and that the constitution was superior\r\nto the law. Thus the ground was prepared for a complicated federal\r\ngovernment, with a national constitution recognized as the supreme law,\r\nand superior both to national enactments and to State constitutions or\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Principles of freedom.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of constitutional government, as we now understand it, was\r\npromoted by the establishment of two different sets of machinery for\r\nmaking laws and carrying on government. The older and the younger branches\r\nof the race were alike accustomed to administer local affairs in local\r\nassemblies, and more general affairs in a general assembly. The two\r\nsystems in both countries worked side by side without friction; hence\r\nAmericans and Englishmen were alike unused to the interference of\r\nofficials in local matters, and accustomed through their representatives\r\nto take an educating share in larger affairs. The principle was firmly\r\nrooted on both sides of the water that taxes were not a matter of right,\r\nbut were a gift of the people, voted directly or through their\r\nrepresentatives. On both sides of the water it was a principle also that a\r\nsubject was entitled to his freedom unless convicted of or charged with a\r\ncrime, and that he should have a speedy, public, and fair trial to\r\nestablish his guilt or innocence. Everywhere among the English-speaking\r\nrace criminal justice was rude, and punishments were barbarous; but the\r\ntendency was to do away with special privileges and legal exemptions.\r\nBefore the courts and before the tax-gatherers all Englishmen stood\r\npractically on the same basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT OF ENGLISH INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning at the time of colonization with substantially the same\r\nprinciples of liberty and government, the two regions developed under\r\ncircumstances so different that, at the end of a century and a half, they\r\nwere as different from each other as from their prototype.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Separation of departments.]\r\n[Sidenote: Aristocracy.]\r\n\r\nThe Stuart sovereigns of England steadily attempted to strengthen their\r\npower, and the resistance to that effort caused an immense growth of\r\nParliamentary influence. The colonies had little occasion to feel or to\r\nresent direct royal prerogative. To them the Crown was represented by\r\ngovernors, with whom they could quarrel without being guilty of treason,\r\nand from whom in general they feared very little, but whom they could not\r\ndepose. Governors shifted rapidly, and colonial assemblies eventually took\r\nover much of the executive business from the governors, or gave it to\r\nofficers whom they elected. But while, in the eighteenth century, the\r\nsystem of a responsible ministry was growing up in England under the\r\nHanoverian kings, the colonies were accustomed to a sharp division between\r\nthe legislative and the executive departments. Situated as they were at a\r\ngreat distance from the mother-country, the assemblies were obliged to\r\npass sweeping laws. The easiest way of checking them was to limit the\r\npower of the assemblies by strong clauses in the charters or in the\r\ngovernor's instructions; and to the very last the governors, and above the\r\ngovernors the king, retained the power of royal veto, which in England was\r\nnever exercised after 1708. Thus the colonies were accustomed to see their\r\nlaws quietly and legally reversed, while Parliament was growing into the\r\nbelief that its will ought to prevail against the king or the judges. In a\r\nwild frontier country the people were obliged to depend upon their\r\nneighbors for defence or companionship. More emphasis was thus thrown upon\r\nthe local governments than in England. The titles of rank, which continued\r\nto have great social and political force in England, were almost unknown\r\nin America. The patroons in New York were in 1750 little more than great\r\nland-owners; the fanciful system of landgraves, palsgraves, and caciques\r\nin Carolina never had any substance. No permanent colonial nobility was\r\never created, and but few titles were conferred on Americans. An American\r\naristocracy did grow up, founded partly on the ownership of land, and\r\npartly on wealth acquired by trade. It existed side by side with a very\r\nopen and accessible democracy of farmers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of the colonies.]\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the colonies were leaders; but if they accepted too many\r\nof the governor's favors or voted for too many of that officer's measures,\r\nthey found themselves left out of the assemblies by their independent\r\nconstituents. The power over territory, the right to grant wild lands, was\r\nalso peculiar to the New World, and led to a special set of difficulties.\r\nIn New England the legislatures insisted on sharing in this power. In\r\nPennsylvania there was an unceasing quarrel over the proprietors' claim to\r\nquit-rents. Farther south the governors made vast grants unquestioned by\r\nthe assemblies. In any event, colonization and the grant of lands were\r\nprovincial matters. Each colony became accustomed to planting new\r\nsettlements and to claiming new boundaries. The English common law was\r\naccepted in all the colonies, but it was modified everywhere by statutes,\r\naccording to the need of each colony. Thus the tendency in colonial\r\ndevelopment was toward broad legislation on all subjects; but at the same\r\ntime the limitations laid down by charters, by the governor's\r\ninstructions, or by the home government, increased and were observed.\r\nAlthough the assemblies freely quarrelled with individual governors and\r\nsheared them of as much power as they could, the people recognized that\r\nthe executive was in many respects beyond their reach. The division of the\r\npowers of government into departments was one of the most notable things\r\nin colonial government, and it made easier the formation of the later\r\nstate and national governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English local government.]\r\n\r\nIn each colony in 1750 were to be found two sets of governing\r\norganizations,--the local and the general. The local unit appears at\r\ndifferent times and in different colonies under many names; there were\r\ntowns, townships, manors, hundreds, ridings, liberties, parishes,\r\nplantations, shires, and counties. Leaving out of account minor\r\nvariations, there were three types of local government,--town government,\r\ncounty government, and a combination of the two. Each of these forms was\r\nfounded on a system with which the colonists were familiar at the time of\r\nsettlement, but each was modified to meet the changed conditions of\r\nAmerica. The English county in 1600 was a military and judicial\r\nsubdivision of the kingdom; but for some local purposes county taxes were\r\nlevied by the quarter sessions, a board of local government. The officers\r\nwere the lord lieutenant, who was the military commander, and the justices\r\nof the peace, who were at the same time petty judges and members of the\r\nadministrative board. The English \"town\" had long since disappeared except\r\nas a name, but its functions were in 1600 still carried out by two\r\npolitical bodies which much resembled it: the first was the parish,--an\r\norganization of persons responsible as tax-payers for the maintenance of\r\nthe church building. In some places an assembly of these tax-payers met\r\nperiodically, chose officers, and voted money for the church edifice, the\r\npoor, roads, and like local purposes. In other places a \"select vestry,\"\r\nor corporation of persons filling its own vacancies, exercised the powers\r\nof parish government. In such cases the members were usually of the more\r\nimportant persons in the parish. The other wide-spread local organization\r\nwas the manor; in origin this was a great estate, the tenants of which\r\nformed an assembly and passed votes for their common purposes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Towns.]\r\n\r\nFrom these different forms of familiar local government the colonists\r\nchose those best suited to their own conditions. New Englanders were\r\nsettled in compact little communities; they liked to live near the church,\r\nand where they could unite for protection from enemies. They preferred the\r\nopen parish assembly, to which they gave the name of \"town meeting.\" Since\r\nsome of the towns were organized before the colonial legislatures began to\r\npass comprehensive laws, the towns continued, by permission of the\r\ncolonial governments, to exercise extended powers. The proceedings of a\r\nBoston town meeting in 1731 are thus reported:--\r\n\r\n\"After Prayer by the Revt. mr. John Webb,\r\n\r\n\"Habijah Savage Esqr. was chose to be Moderator for this meeting\r\n\r\n\"Proposed to Consider About Reparing mr. Nathaniell Williams His Kitchen\r\n&c.--\r\n\r\n\"In Answer to the Earnest Desire of the Honourable House of\r\nRepresentatives--\r\n\r\n\"Voted an Entire Satisfaction in the Town in the late Conduct of their\r\nRepresentatives in Endeavoring to preserve their Valuable Priviledges, And\r\nPray their further Endeavors therein--\r\n\r\n\"Voted. That the Afair of Repairing of the Wharff leading to the North\r\nBattrey, be left with the Selectmen to do therein as they Judge best--\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Counties.]\r\n\r\nThe county was also organized in New England, but took on chiefly judicial\r\nand military functions, and speedily abandoned local administration. In\r\nthe South the people settled in separate plantations, usually strung out\r\nalong the rivers. Popular assemblies were inconvenient, and for local\r\npurposes the people adopted the English select vestry system in what they\r\ncalled parishes. The county government was emphasized, and they adopted\r\nthe English system of justices of the peace, who were appointed by the\r\ngovernor and endowed with large powers of county legislation. Hence in the\r\nSouth the local government fell into the hands of the principal men of\r\neach parish without election, while in New England it was in the hands of\r\nthe voters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mixed System.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the middle colonies the towns and counties were both active and\r\nhad a relation with each other which was the forerunner of the present\r\nsystem of local government in the Western States. In New York each town\r\nchose a member of the county board of supervisors; in Pennsylvania the\r\ncounty officers as well as the town officers became elective. Whatever the\r\nvariations, the effect of local government throughout the colonies was the\r\nsame. The people carried on or neglected their town and county business\r\nunder a system defined by colonial laws; but no colonial officer was\r\ncharged with the supervision of local affairs. In all the changes of a\r\ncentury and a half since 1750 these principles of decentralization have\r\nbeen maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. COLONIAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General form.]\r\n[Sidenote: Suffrage.]\r\n\r\nEarlier than local governments in their development, and always superior\r\nto them in powers, were the colonial governments. In 1750 there was a\r\ntechnical distinction between the charter governments of Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, and Rhode Island, the proprietary governments of\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, and the provincial governments of\r\nthe eight other continental colonies. In the first group there were\r\ncharters which were substantially written constitutions binding on both\r\nking and colonists, and unalterable except by mutual consent. In the\r\nsecond group some subject, acting under a royal charter, appointed the\r\ngovernors, granted the lands, and stood between the colonists and the\r\nCrown. In the third group, precedent and the governor's instructions were\r\nthe only constitution. In essence, all the colonies of all three groups\r\nhad the same form of government. In each there was an elective\r\nlegislature; in each the suffrage was very limited; everywhere the\r\nownership of land in freehold was a requisite, just as it was in England,\r\nfor the county suffrage. In many cases there was an additional provision\r\nthat the voter must have a specified large quantity of land or must pay\r\nspecified taxes. In some colonies there was a religious requirement. The\r\nland qualification worked very differently from the same system in\r\nEngland. Any man of vigor and industry might acquire land; and thus,\r\nwithout altering the letter of the law to which they were accustomed, the\r\ncolonial suffrage was practically enlarged, and the foundations of\r\ndemocracy were laid. Nevertheless, the number of voters at that time was\r\nnot more than a fifth to an eighth as large in proportion to the\r\npopulation as at present. In Connecticut in 1775 among 200,000 people\r\nthere were but 4,325 voters. In 1890, the fourth Connecticut district,\r\nhaving about the same population, cast a vote of 36,500.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislature.]\r\n\r\nThe participation of the people in their own government was the more\r\nsignificant, because the colonies actually had what England only seemed to\r\nhave,--three departments of government. The legislative branch was\r\ncomposed in almost all cases of two houses; the lower house was elective,\r\nand by its control over money bills it frequently forced the passage of\r\nmeasures unacceptable to the co-ordinate house. This latter, except in a\r\nfew cases, was a small body appointed by the governor, and had the\r\nfunctions of the executive council as well as of an upper house. The\r\ngovernor was a third part of the legislature in so far as he chose to\r\nexercise his veto power. The only other limitation on the legislative\r\npower of the assemblies was the general proviso that no act \"was to be\r\ncontrary to the law of England, but agreeable thereto.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive.]\r\n\r\nThe governor was the head of the executive department,--sometimes a native\r\nof the colony, as Hutchinson of Massachusetts, and Clinton of New York.\r\nBut he was often sent from over seas, as Cornbury of New York, and Dunmore\r\nof Virginia. In Connecticut and Rhode Island the legislatures chose the\r\ngovernor; but they fell in with the prevailing practice by frequently re-\r\nelecting men for a succession of years. The governor's chief power was\r\nthat of appointment, although the assemblies strove to deprive him of it\r\nby electing treasurers and other executive officers. He had also the\r\nprestige of his little court, and was able to form at least a small party\r\nof adherents. As a representative of the home government he was the object\r\nof suspicion and defiance. As the receiver and dispenser of annoying fees,\r\nhe was likely to be unpopular; and wherever it could do so, the assembly\r\nmade him feel his dependence upon it for his salary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judiciary.]\r\n\r\nColonial courts were nearly out of the reach of the assemblies, except\r\nthat their salaries might be reduced or withheld. The judges were\r\nappointed by the governor, held during good behavior, and were reasonably\r\nindependent both of royal interference and of popular clamor. The\r\ngovernor's council was commonly the highest court in the colony; hence the\r\nquestion of the constitutionality of an act was seldom raised: since the\r\ncouncil could defeat the bill by voting against it, it was seldom\r\nnecessary to quash it by judicial process. Legal fees were high, and the\r\ncourts were the most unpopular part of the governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ENGLISH CONTROL OF THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English statutes.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Crown.]\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament.]\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut and Rhode Island, where the governor was not appointed by\r\nthe Crown, the colonies closely approached the condition of republics; but\r\neven in these cases they acknowledged several powers in England to which\r\nthey were all subject. First came English law. It was a generally accepted\r\nprinciple that all English statutes in effect at the time of the first\r\ncolonization held good for the colonies so far as applicable; and the\r\nprinciples of the common law were everywhere accepted. Second came the\r\nCrown. When the colonies were founded, the feudal system was practically\r\ndead in England; but the conception that the Crown held the original title\r\nto all the lands was applied in the colonies, so that all titles went back\r\nto Indian or royal grants. Parliament made no protest when the king\r\ndivided up and gave away the New World. Parliament acquiesced when by\r\ncharter he created trading companies and bestowed upon them powers of\r\ngovernment. Down to 1765 Parliament seldom legislated for individual\r\ncolonies, and it was generally held that the colonies were not included in\r\nEnglish statutes unless specially mentioned. The Crown created the\r\ncolonies, gave them governors, permitted the local assemblies to grow up,\r\nand directed the course of the colonial executive by royal instructions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of control.]\r\n\r\nThe agent of the sovereign in these matters was from 1696 to 1760 the so-\r\ncalled Lords of the Board of Trade and Plantations. This commission,\r\nappointed by The Crown, corresponded with the governors, made\r\nrecommendations, and examined colonial laws. Through them were exercised\r\nthe two branches of English control. Governors were directed to carry out\r\na specified policy or to veto specified classes of laws. If they were\r\ndisobedient or weak, the law might still be voided by a royal rescript.\r\nThe attorneys-general of the Crown were constantly called on to examine\r\nlaws with a view to their veto, and their replies have been collected in\r\nChalmers's \"Opinions,\"--a storehouse of material concerning the relations\r\nof the colonies with the home government. The process of disallowance was\r\nslow. Laws were therefore often passed in the colonies for successive\r\nbrief periods, thus avoiding the effects of a veto; or \"Resolves\" were\r\npassed which had the force, though not the name, of statutes. In times of\r\ncrisis the Crown showed energy in trying to draw out the military strength\r\nof the colonies; but if the assemblies hung back there was no means of\r\nforcing them to be active. During the Stuart period the troubles at home\r\nprevented strict attention to colonial matters. Under the Hanoverian kings\r\nthe colonies were little disturbed by any active interference. In one\r\nrespect only did the home government press hard upon the colonies. A\r\nsuccession of Navigation Acts, beginning about 1650, limited the English\r\ncolonies to direct trade with the home country, in English or colonial\r\nvessels. Even between neighboring English colonies trade was hampered by\r\nrestrictions or absolute prohibitions. Against the legal right of\r\nParliament thus to control the trade of the colonies the Americans did not\r\nprotest. Protest was unnecessary, since in 1750 the Acts were\r\nsystematically disregarded: foreign vessels carried freights to and from\r\nAmerican ports; American goods were shipped direct to foreign countries (§\r\n23; Colonies, §§ 44, 128).\r\n\r\n\r\n9. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social life.]\r\n[Sidenote: Intellectual life.]\r\n[Sidenote: Economic conditions.]\r\n\r\nThus, partly from circumstances, and partly by their own design, the\r\ncolonies in 1750 were developing a political life of their own. Changes of\r\ndynasties and of sovereigns or of ministers in England little affected\r\nthem. In like manner their social customs were slowly changing. The\r\nabundance of land favored the growth of a yeoman class accustomed to take\r\npart in the government. Savage neighbors made necessary a rough military\r\ndiscipline, and the community was armed. The distance from England and an\r\nindependent spirit threw great responsibility on the assemblies. The\r\ngeneral evenness of social conditions, except that some men held more land\r\nthan others, helped on a democratic spirit. The conditions of the colonies\r\nwere those of free and independent communities. On the other hand,\r\ncolonial life was at best retired and narrow; roads were poor, inns\r\nindifferent, and travelling was unusual. The people had the boisterous\r\ntastes and dangerous amusements of frontiersmen. Outside of New England\r\nthere were almost no schools, and in New England schools were very poor.\r\nIn 1750 Harvard, Yale, William and Mary, and the College of New Jersey\r\n(now Princeton) were the only colleges, and the education which they gave\r\nwas narrower than that now furnished by a good high school. Newspapers\r\nwere few and dull. Except in theology, there was no special instruction\r\nfor professional men. In most colonies lawyers were lightly esteemed, and\r\nphysicians little known. City life did not exist; Philadelphia, Boston,\r\nNew York, and Charleston were but provincial towns. The colonies had only\r\nthree industries,--agriculture, the fisheries, and shipping. Tobacco had\r\nfor more than a century been the staple export. Next in importance was the\r\nNew England fishery, employing six hundred vessels, and the commerce with\r\nthe West Indies, which arose out of that industry. Other staple exports\r\nwere whale products, bread-stuffs, naval stores, masts, and pig-iron.\r\nThe total value of exports in 1750 is estimated at £814,000. To carry\r\nthese products a fleet of at least two hundred vessels was employed;\r\nthey were built in the colonies north of Virginia, and most of them in New\r\nEngland. The vessels themselves were often sold abroad. With the proceeds\r\nof the exports the colonists bought the manufactured articles which they\r\nprized. Under the Navigation Acts these ought all to have come from\r\nEngland; but French silks, Holland gin, and Martinique sugar somehow found\r\ntheir way into the colonies. The colonists and the home government tried\r\nto establish new industries by granting bounties. Thus the indigo culture\r\nin South Carolina was begun, and many unsuccessful attempts were made to\r\nstart silk manufactures and wine raising. The method of stimulating\r\nmanufactures by laying protective duties was not unknown; but England\r\ncould not permit the colonies to discriminate against home merchants, and\r\nhad no desire to see them establish by protective duties competitors for\r\nEnglish manufactures. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania did in a few cases lay\r\nlow protective duties. Except for the sea-faring pursuits of the Northern\r\ncolonies, the whole continental group was in the same dependent condition.\r\nThe colonists raised their own food and made their own clothes; the\r\nsurplus of their crops was sent abroad and converted into manufactured\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n10. COLONIAL SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slave trade.]\r\n[Sidenote: The sections.]\r\n\r\nIn appearance the labor system of all the colonies was the same. Besides\r\npaid white laborers, there was everywhere a class of white servants bound\r\nwithout wages for a term of years, and a more miserable class of negro\r\nslaves. From Nova Scotia to Georgia, in all the West Indies, in the\r\nneighboring French and Spanish colonies, negro slavery was in 1750 lawful,\r\nand appeared to flourish. Many attempts had been made by colonial\r\nlegislatures to cut off or to tax the importation of slaves. Sometimes\r\nthey feared the growing number of negroes, sometimes they desired more\r\nrevenue. The legislators do not appear to have been moved by moral\r\nobjections to slavery. Nevertheless, there was a striking difference\r\nbetween the sections with regard to slavery. In all the colonies north of\r\nMaryland the winters were so cold as to interfere with farming, and some\r\ndifferent winter work had to be provided. For such variations of labor,\r\nslaves are not well fitted; hence there were but two regions in the North\r\nwhere slaves were profitably employed as field-hands,--on Narragansett Bay\r\nand on the Hudson: elsewhere the negroes were house or body servants, and\r\nslaves were rather an evidence of the master's consequence than of their\r\nvalue in agriculture. In the South, where land could be worked during a\r\nlarger portion of the year, and where the conditions of life were easier,\r\nslavery was profitable, and the large plantations could not be kept up\r\nwithout fresh importations. Hence, if any force could be brought to bear\r\nagainst negro slavery it would easily affect the North, and would be\r\nresisted by the South; in the middle colonies the struggle might be long;\r\nbut even there slavery was not of sufficient value to make it permanent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-slavery agitation.]\r\n\r\nSuch a force was found in a moral agitation already under way in 1750. The\r\nPuritans and the Quakers both upheld principles which, if carried to their\r\nlegitimate consequences, would do away with slavery. The share which all\r\nmen had in Christ's saving grace was to render them brethren hereafter;\r\nand who should dare to subject one to another in this earthly life? The\r\nvoice of Roger Williams was raised in 1637 to ask whether, after \"a due\r\ntime of trayning to labour and restraint, they ought not to be set free?\"\r\n\"How cursed a crime is it,\" exclaimed old Sewall in 1700, \"to equal men to\r\nbeasts! These Ethiopians, black as they are, are sons and daughters of the\r\nfirst Adam, brethren and sisters of the last Adam, and the offspring of\r\nGod.\" On \"2d mo. 18, 1688,\" the Germantown Friends presented the first\r\npetition against slavery recorded in American history. By 1750\r\nprofessional anti-slavery agitators like John Woolman and Benezet were at\r\nwork in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and many wealthy Quakers had set free\r\ntheir slaves. The wedge which was eventually to divide the North from the\r\nSouth was already driven in 1750. In his great speech on the Writs of\r\nAssistance in 1761, James Otis so spoke that John Adams said: \"Not a\r\nQuaker in Philadelphia, or Mr. Jefferson of Virginia, ever asserted the\r\nrights of negroes in stronger terms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF THE FRENCH (1750-1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n11.

RIVAL CLAIMS IN NORTH AMERICA (1690-1754).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International rivalry.]\r\n\r\n\"The firing of a gun in the woods of North America brought on a conflict\r\nwhich drenched Europe in blood.\" In this rhetorical statement is suggested\r\nthe result of a great change in American conditions after 1750. For the\r\nfirst time in the history of the colonies the settlements of England and\r\nFrance were brought so near together as to provoke collisions in time of\r\npeace. The attack on the French by the Virginia troops under Washington in\r\n1754 was an evidence that France and England were ready to join in a\r\nstruggle for the possession of the interior of the continent, even though\r\nit led to a general European war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legal arguments.]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Aix-la-Chapelle of 1748 (Colonies, § 112) had not laid down a\r\ndefinite line between the French and the English possessions west of the\r\nmountains, According to the principles of international law observed at\r\nthe time of colonization, each power was entitled to the territory drained\r\nby the rivers falling into that part of the sea-coast which it controlled.\r\nThe French, therefore, asserted a _prima facie_ title to the valleys\r\nof the St. Lawrence and of the Mississippi (§ 2); if there was a natural\r\nboundary between the two powers, it was the watershed north and west of\r\nthe sources of the St. John, Penobscot, Connecticut, Hudson, Susquehanna,\r\nPotomac, and James. On neither side had permanent settlements been\r\nestablished far beyond this irregular ridge. This natural boundary had,\r\nhowever, been disregarded in the early English grants. Did not the charter\r\nof 1609 give to Virginia the territory \"up into the land, from sea to sea,\r\nwest and northwest\"? (Colonies, § 29.) Did not the Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Carolina grants run westward to the \"South Sea\"? And\r\nalthough these grants had lapsed, the power of the king to make them was\r\nundiminished; the Pennsylvania charter, the latest of all, gave title far\r\nwest of the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expediency.]\r\n\r\nTo these paper claims were added arguments of convenience: the Lake\r\nChamplain region, the southern tributaries of Lake Ontario, and the\r\nheadwaters of the Ohio, were more easily reached from the Atlantic coast\r\nthan by working up the rapids of the St Lawrence and its tributaries, or\r\nagainst two thousand miles of swift current on the Mississippi. To the\r\nAnglo-Saxon hunger for more land was added the fear of Indian attacks; the\r\nsavages were alarmed by the advance of settlements, and no principles of\r\ninternational law could prevent frontiersmen from exploring the region\r\nclaimed by France, or from occupying favorite spots. There was no\r\nopportunity for compromise between the two parties; agreement was\r\nimpossible, a conflict was a mere matter of time, and the elaborate\r\narguments which each side set forth as a basis for its claim were intended\r\nonly to give the prestige of a legal title. In the struggle the English\r\ncolonies had one significant moral advantage: they desired the land that\r\nthey might occupy it; the French wished only to hold it vacant for some\r\nfuture and remote settlement, or to control the fur-trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. COLLISIONS ON THE FRONTIER (1749-1754).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Iroquois]\r\n\r\nFor many years the final conflict had been postponed by the existence of a\r\nbarrier state,--the Iroquois, or Six Nations of Indians. This fierce,\r\nbrave, and statesmanlike race held a strip of the watershed from Lake\r\nChamplain to the Allegheny River. For many years they had been subject to\r\nEnglish influence, exercised chiefly by William Johnson; but the\r\nundisturbed possession of their lands was the price of their friendship.\r\nThey held back the current of immigration through the Mohawk. They aimed\r\nto be the intermediary for the fur-trade from the northwest. They remained\r\nthroughout the conflict for the most part neutral, but forced the\r\ncontestants to carry on their wars east or south of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English claims.]\r\n\r\nSouthwest of the territory of the Iroquois lay the region of the upper\r\nOhio and its tributaries, particularly the valleys of the Tennessee, the\r\nMuskingum, the Allegheny, the Monongahela and its mountain-descending\r\ntributary, the Youghioghany, of which the upper waters interlace with\r\nbranches of the Potomac. In this rich country, heavily wooded and\r\nabounding in game, there were only a few Indians and no white inhabitants.\r\nIn 1749 France began to send expeditions through the Ohio valley to raise\r\nthe French flag and to bury leaden plates bearing the royal arms. A part\r\nof the disputed region was claimed by Pennsylvania as within her charter\r\nlimits; Virginia claimed it, apparently on the convenient principle that\r\nany unoccupied land adjacent to her territory was hers; the English\r\ngovernment claimed it as a vacant royal preserve; and in 1749 an Ohio\r\ncompany was formed with the purpose of erecting the disputed region into a\r\n\"back colony.\" A royal grant of land was secured, and a young Virginian,\r\nnamed George Washington, was sent out as a surveyor. He took the\r\nopportunity to locate some land for himself, and frankly says that \"it is\r\nnot reasonable to suppose that those, who had the first choice,... were\r\ninattentive to ... the advantages of situation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts to occupy.]\r\n\r\nForeseeing the struggle, the French began to construct a chain of forts\r\nconnecting the St. Lawrence settlements with the Mississippi. The chief\r\nstrategic point was at the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela\r\nrivers,--the present site of Pittsburg. The Ohio company were first on the\r\nground, and in 1753 took steps to occupy this spot. They were backed up by\r\norders issued by the British government to the governors of Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland \"to repel force by force whenever the French are found within\r\nthe undoubted limits of their province.\" Thus the French and English\r\nsettlements were brought dangerously near together, and it was resolved by\r\nVirginia to send George Washington with a solemn warning to the French. In\r\nOctober, 1753, he set forth, and returned in December to announce that the\r\nFrench were determined to hold the country. They drove the few English out\r\nof their new post, fortified the spot, and called it Fort Duquesne. The\r\ncrisis seemed to Benjamin Franklin so momentous that at the end of his\r\nprinted account of the capture of the post he added a rude woodcut of a\r\nrattlesnake cut into thirteen pieces, with the motto, addressed to the\r\ncolonies, \"Join or die.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No compromise.]\r\n\r\nThis was no ordinary intercolonial difficulty, to be patched up by\r\nagreements between the frontier commanders. Both French and English\r\nofficers acted under orders from their courts. England and France were\r\nrivals, not only on the continent, but in the West Indies, in India, and\r\nin Europe. There was no disposition either to prevent or to heal the\r\nbreach on the Pennsylvania frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Washington attacks.]\r\n\r\nWhen Washington set out with a small force in April, 1754, it was with the\r\ndeliberate intention of driving the French out of the region. As he\r\nadvanced towards Fort Duquesne they came out to meet him. He was the\r\nquicker, and surprised the little expedition at Great Meadows, fired upon\r\nthe French, and killed ten of them. A few days later Washington and his\r\ncommand were captured at Fort Necessity, and obliged to leave the country.\r\nAs Half King, an Iroquois chief, said, \"The French behaved like cowards,\r\nand the English like fools.\" The colonial war had begun. Troops were at\r\nonce despatched to America by both belligerents. In 1755 hostilities also\r\nbroke out between the two powers on the sea; but it was not until May 18,\r\n1756, that England formally declared war on France, and the Seven Years'\r\nWar began in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE STRENGTH OF THE PARTIES (1754).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England and France.]\r\n\r\nThe first organized campaign in America was in 1755. Its effect was to\r\nshow that the combatants were not far from equally matched. France claimed\r\nthe position of the first European power: her army was large, her soldiers\r\nwell trained; her comparative weakness at sea was not yet evident. The\r\nEnglish navy had been reduced to 17,000 men; the whole English army\r\ncounted 18,000 men, of whom there were in America but 1,000. Yet England\r\nwas superior when it came to building ships, equipping troops, and\r\nfurnishing money subsidies to keep her allies in the field. The advantage\r\nof prestige in Europe was thrown away when France allied herself with her\r\nhereditary enemy, Austria, and thus involved herself in wars which kept\r\nher from sending adequate reinforcements to America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The colonies.]\r\n\r\nUntil 1758 the war in the western world was fought on both sides chiefly\r\nby the colonists. Here the British Americans had a numerical advantage\r\nover the French. Against the 80,000 white Canadians and Louisianians they\r\ncould oppose more than 1,100,000 whites. Had the English colonists, like\r\nthe Canadians, been organized into one province, they might have been\r\nsuccessful within a year; but the freedom and local independence of the\r\nfourteen colonies made them, in a military sense, weaker than their\r\nneighbors. In Canada there was neither local government nor public\r\nopinion; governors and intendants sent out from Paris ruled the people\r\nunder regulations framed in Paris for the benefit of the court centred in\r\nParis. While the colonies with difficulty raised volunteer troops, the\r\nFrench commander could make a _levée en masse_ of the whole adult male\r\npopulation. During the four campaigns from 1755 to 1758 the Canadians\r\nlost little territory, and they were finally conquered only by a powerful\r\nexpedition of British regular troops and ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indians.]\r\n[Sidenote: Theatre of war.]\r\n\r\nOne reason for this unexpected resistance was the aid of the Indians. The\r\nLatin races have always had more influence over savage dependents than the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. The French knew how to use the Indians as auxiliaries by\r\nletting them make war on their own account and in their own barbarous\r\nfashion. Nevertheless the Indians did not fight for the mere sake of\r\nobliging the French, and when the tide turned, in 1759, they were mostly\r\ndetached. One other great advantage was enjoyed by the French: their\r\nterritory was difficult of access. The exposed coast was protected by the\r\nstrong fortresses of Louisbourg and Quebec, On the east, in the centre,\r\nand on the Ohio they were in occupation and stood on the defensive. Acting\r\non the interior of their line, they could mass troops at any threatened\r\npoint. In the end their line was rolled up like a scroll from both ends.\r\nLouisbourg and Fort Duquesne were both taken in 1758, but Montreal was\r\nable to hold out until 1760.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. CONGRESS OF ALBANY (1754).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian treaty.]\r\n[Sidenote: Union proposed]\r\n\r\nForeseeing a general colonial war, the Lords of Trade, in September, 1753,\r\ndirected the colonial governors to procure the sending of commissioners to\r\nAlbany. The first purpose was to make a treaty with the Iroquois; but a\r\nsuggestion was made in America that the commissioners also draw up a plan\r\nof colonial union. In June, 1754, a body of delegates assembled from the\r\nNew England colonies, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The Indian\r\ntreaty was duly framed, notwithstanding the ominous suggestion of one of\r\nthe savages: \"It is but one step from Canada hither, and the French may\r\neasily come and turn you out of your doors.\" On June 24 the Congress of\r\nAlbany adopted unanimously the resolution that \"a union of all the\r\ncolonies is at present absolutely necessary for their security and\r\ndefence;\" and that \"it would be necessary that the union be established by\r\nAct of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franklin's scheme.]\r\n\r\nSince the extinction of the New England Confederation in 1684 (Colonies, §\r\n69) there had been no approach to any colonial union. The suggestions of\r\nWilliam III., of the Lords of Trade, of ministers, of colonial governors,\r\nand of private individuals had remained without effect To Benjamin\r\nFranklin was committed the task of drawing up a scheme which should at the\r\nsame time satisfy the colonial assemblies and the mother government. The\r\nadvantages of such an union were obvious. Combined action meant speedy\r\nvictory; separate defence meant that much of the border would be exposed\r\nto invasion. Franklin hoped to take advantage of the pressure of the war\r\nto induce the colonies to accept a permanent union. His draft, therefore,\r\nprovided for a \"President General,\" who should have toward the union the\r\npowers usually enjoyed by a governor towards his colony. This was not\r\nunlike a project in view when Andros was sent over in 1685. The startling\r\ninnovation of the scheme was a \"Grand Council,\" to be chosen by the\r\ncolonial assemblies. The duty of this general government was to regulate\r\nIndian affairs, make frontier settlements, and protect and defend the\r\ncolonists. The plan grew upon Franklin as he considered it, and he added a\r\nscheme for general taxes, the funds to be raised by requisitions for\r\nspecific sums on the separate colonial treasurers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The union fails.]\r\n\r\nThe interest of the plan is that it resembles the later Articles of\r\nConfederation. At first it seemed likely to succeed; none of the twenty-\r\nfive members of the congress seem to have opposed it, but not one colony\r\naccepted it. The charter and proprietary colonies feared that they might\r\nlose the guaranty afforded by their existing grants. The new union was to\r\nbe established by Act of Parliament. Of government by that body they knew\r\nlittle, and they had no disposition to increase the power of the Crown.\r\nThe town of Boston voted \"to oppose any plan of union whereby they shall\r\napprehend the Liberties and Priviledges of the People are endangered.\" The\r\nBritish government also feared a permanent union, lest it teach the\r\ncolonies their own strength in organization. The movement for the union\r\nhad but the faint approval of the Lords of Trade, and received no\r\nconsideration in England. As Franklin said: \"The assemblies all thought\r\nthere was too much _prerogative_, and in England it was thought to have\r\ntoo much of the _democratic_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n16. MILITARY OPERATIONS (1755-1757).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the war]\r\n\r\nWashington's defeat in 1754 was followed by active military preparations\r\non both sides. So far as the number of campaigns and casualties goes, it\r\nwas a war of little significance; but it was marked by romantic incidents\r\nand heroic deeds. Much of the fighting took place in the forest. The\r\nIndians showed their characteristic daring and their characteristic\r\nunwillingness to stand a long-continued, steady attack. Their scalping-\r\nknives and stakes added a fearful horror to many of the battles. On both\r\nsides the military policy seemed simple. The English must attack, the\r\nFrench must do their best to defend. The French were vulnerable in Nova\r\nScotia and on the Ohio; their centre also was pierced by two highways\r\nleading from the Hudson,--one through Lake Champlain, the other through\r\nthe Mohawk and Lake Ontario. These four regions must be the theatre of\r\nwar, and in 1755 the British government, seconded by the colonists,\r\nplanned an attack on the four points simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Braddock's expedition.]\r\n\r\nThe most difficult of the four tasks was the reduction of Fort Duquesne,\r\nand it was committed to a small force of British regulars, with colonial\r\ncontingents, under the command of General Braddock. The character of this\r\nrepresentative of British military authority is summed up in a phrase of\r\nhis secretary's: \"We have a general most judiciously chosen for being\r\ndisqualified for the service he is employed on in almost every respect.\"\r\nBefore him lay three plain duties,--to co-operate with the provincial\r\nauthorities in protecting the frontier, to impress upon the Indians the\r\nsuperior strength of the English, and to occupy the disputed territory. He\r\ndid none of them. Among the provincials was George Washington, whose\r\nexperience in this very region ought to have influenced the general; but\r\nthe latter obstinately refused to learn that the rules of war must be\r\nmodified in a rough and wooded country, among frontiersmen and savage\r\nenemies. July 9, 1755, the expedition reached a point eight miles from\r\nFort Duquesne. As Braddock's little army marched forward, with careful\r\nprotection against surprise, it was greeted with a volley from 250 French\r\nCanadians and 230 Indian allies. Though the Canadians fled, the Indians\r\nstood their ground from behind trees and logs. The Virginians and a few\r\nregulars took to trees also, but were beaten back by the oaths and blows\r\nof Braddock. \"We would fight,\" they said, \"if we could see anybody to\r\nfight with.\" After three hours' stand against an invisible foe, Braddock's\r\nmen broke and abandoned the field. Out of 1,466 officers and men, but 482\r\ncame off safe. The remnant of the expedition fled, abandoned the country,\r\nleft the frontier unprotected; and over the road which they had\r\nconstructed came a stream of marauding Indians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Removal of the Acadians.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre the double campaign was equally unfruitful. On the borders\r\nof Nova Scotia the French forts were captured. The victors felt unable to\r\nhold the province, although it had been theirs since 1713, except by\r\nremoving the French Acadian inhabitants. It was a strong measure, carried\r\nout with severity. Six thousand persons were distributed among the\r\ncolonies farther south, where their religion and their language both\r\ncaused them to be suspected and often kept them from a livelihood. The\r\njustification was that the Acadians were under French influence, and were\r\nlikely to be added to the fighting force of the enemy; the judgment of\r\nParkman is that the \"government of France began with making the Acadians\r\nits tools, and ended with making them its victims.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaigns of 1756, 1757.]\r\n\r\nThe campaigns of 1756 and 1757 were like that of 1755. After the retreat\r\nof Braddock's expedition the frontier of Virginia and Pennsylvania was\r\nleft to the ravages of the Indians. The two colonies were slow to defend\r\nthemselves, and had no help from England. Systematic warfare was still\r\ncarried on in the centre and in the East. The French, under the guidance\r\nof their new commander, Montcalm, lost no ground, and gained Oswego and\r\nFort William Henry. The English cause in Europe was declining. In the Far\r\nEast alone had great successes been gained; and the battle of Plassey in\r\n1757 gave to England the paramount influence in India which she has ever\r\nsince exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. THE CONQUEST OF CANADA (1756-1780).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Pitt.]\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1758.]\r\n\r\nFew characters in history are indispensable. From William of Orange to\r\nWilliam Pitt the younger there was but one man without whom English\r\nhistory must have taken a different turn, and that was William Pitt the\r\nelder. In 1757 he came forward as a representative of the English people,\r\nand forced his way into leadership by the sheer weight of his character.\r\nHe secured a subsidy for Prussia, which was desperately making head\r\nagainst France, Austria, and Russia in coalition. He made a comprehensive\r\nplan for a combined attack on the French posts in America. He organized\r\nfleets and armies. He was able to break through the power of court\r\ninfluence, and to appoint efficient commanders. The first point of attack\r\nwas Louisbourg, the North Atlantic naval station of the French. Since its\r\ncapture by the New Englanders in 1745 (Colonies, § 127) it had been\r\nstrongly fortified. An English force under Amherst and Wolfe reduced it\r\nafter a brief siege in 1758. The attack through Lake George failed in\r\nconsequence of the inefficiency of the English commander, Abercrombie, but\r\nthe English penetrated across Lake Ontario and took Niagara. Nov. 25,\r\n1758, Fort Duquesne was occupied by the English, and the spot was named\r\nPittsburg, after the great minister. For the first time the tide of war\r\nset inward towards the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Quebec.]\r\n\r\nIt is not evident that at the beginning the English expected more than to\r\nget control of Lake Champlain and of the country south of Lake Erie. The\r\nsuccesses of 1758 led the way to the invasion, and eventually to the\r\noccupation, of the whole country. France sent thousands of troops into the\r\nEuropean wars, but left the defence of its American empire to Montcalm\r\nwith 5,000 regulars, 10,000 Canadian militia, and a few thousand savage\r\nallies. England, meanwhile, was able to send ships with 9,000 men to take\r\nQuebec. No exploit is more remarkable than the capture of that famous\r\nfortress. It was the key to the whole province; it was deemed impregnable;\r\nit was defended by superior numbers. The English, after vain attempts,\r\nwere on the point of abandoning the siege. Wolfe's resolution and daring\r\nfound a way over the cliffs; and on the morning of Sept. 13, 1759, the\r\nlittle English army was drawn up on the Plains of Abraham outside the\r\nlandward fortifications of the city; the fate of Canada was decided in a\r\nbattle in the open; the dying Wolfe defeated the dying Montcalm, and the\r\ntown surrendered. The fall of the rest of Canada was simply a matter of\r\ntime. One desperate attempt to retake Quebec was made in 1760, but the\r\nforce of Canada had spent itself. The 2,400 defenders of Montreal\r\nsurrendered to 17,000 assailants. The colony of New France ceased to\r\nexist. For three years English military officers formed the only\r\ngovernment of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE WAR (1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: European war.]\r\n[Sidenote: George III.]\r\n[Sidenote: The war continued.]\r\n\r\nThe conflict in Europe continued for three years after the colonial war\r\nwas at an end. During 1758, 1759, and 1760 Frederick the Second of Prussia\r\nhad held his own, with English aid; he was now to lose his ally. The\r\nsudden death of George the Second had brought to the throne the first\r\nenergetic sovereign since William the Third. An early public utterance of\r\nGeorge the Third indicated that a new dynasty had arisen: \"Born and bred\r\nin England, I glory in the name of Briton.\" With no brilliancy of speech\r\nand no attractiveness of person or manner, George the Third had a positive\r\nand forcible character. He resented the control of the great Whig\r\nfamilies, to whom his grandfather and great-grandfather had owed their\r\nthrones. He represented a principle of authority and resistance to the\r\nunwritten power of Parliament and to the control of the cabinet. He had\r\nvirtues not inherited and not common in his time; he was a good husband, a\r\nkind-hearted man, punctilious, upright, and truthful. He had, therefore, a\r\ncertain popularity, notwithstanding his narrow-mindedness, obstinacy, and\r\narrogance. Resolved to take a personal part in the government of his\r\ncountry, he began by building up a party of the \"king's friends,\" which\r\nlater supported him in the great struggle with the colonies. In a word,\r\nGeorge the Third attempted to restore the Crown to the position which it\r\nhad occupied under the last Stuart. Between such a king and the imperious\r\nPitt there could not long be harmony. The king desired peace with all\r\npowers, and especially with France; Pitt insisted on continuing aggressive\r\nwar. In 1761 Pitt was forced to resign, and Frederick the Second was\r\nabandoned. A change of sovereigns in Russia caused a change of policy, and\r\nPrussia was saved. Still peace was not made, and in 1762 Spain joined with\r\nFrance in the war on England; but the naval supremacy of England was\r\nindisputable. The French West India Islands and Havana, the fortress of\r\nthe Spanish province of Cuba, were taken; and France was forced to make\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of Annexations.]\r\n[Sidenote: Canada ceded.]\r\n\r\nIn the negotiations the most important question was the disposition of the\r\nEnglish conquests in America. Besides the Ohio country, the ostensible\r\nobject of the war, Great Britain held both Canada and the French West\r\nIndies. The time seemed ripe to relieve the colonies from the dangers\r\narising from the French settlements on the north, and the Spanish colonies\r\nin Florida and Cuba. The ministry wavered between keeping Guadeloupe and\r\nkeeping Canada; but if they were unable to deal with 8,000 Acadians in\r\n1755, what should they do with 80,000 Canadians in 1763? Was the\r\ninhospitable valley of the Lower St. Lawrence worth the occupation. And if\r\nthe French were excluded from North America, could the loyalty of the\r\ncolonies be guaranteed? France, however, humbled by the war, was forced to\r\nyield territory somewhere; Canada had long been a burden on the French\r\ntreasury; since concession must be made, it seemed better to sacrifice the\r\nnorthern colonies rather than the profitable West Indies. Choiseul, the\r\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, therefore ceded to England all the\r\nFrench possessions east of the Mississippi except the tract between the\r\nAmitic and the Mississippi, in which lay the town of New Orleans. The\r\nisland of Cape Breton went with Canada, of which it was an outlyer. The\r\nwound to the prestige of France he passed over with a jaunty apothegm: \"I\r\nceded it,\" he said, \"on purpose to destroy the English nation. They were\r\nfond of American dominion, and I resolved they should have enough of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louisiana ceded.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Spaniards clamored for some compensation for their own\r\nlosses. The English yielded up Havana, and kept the two provinces of\r\nFlorida lying along the Gulf; and France transferred to Spain all the\r\nprovince of Louisiana not already given to England, that is, the western\r\nhalf of the Mississippi valley, and the Isle d'Orléans. The population was\r\nstretched along the river front of the Mississippi and its lower branches;\r\nit was devotedly French, and it was furious at the transfer. Of all her\r\nAmerican possessions France retained only her West Indies and the\r\ninsignificant islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon in the Gulf of St\r\nLawrence. Thenceforward there were but two North American powers. Spain\r\nhad all the continent from the Isthmus of Panama to the Mississippi, and\r\nnorthward to the upper watershed of the Missouri, and she controlled both\r\nsides of the Mississippi at its mouth. England had the eastern half of the\r\ncontinent from the Gulf to the Arctic Ocean, with an indefinite stretch\r\nwest of Hudson's Bay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interior boundaries.]\r\n\r\nThe interior boundaries of the English colonies were now defined by\r\nproclamations and instructions from Great Britain. A colony of Canada was\r\nestablished which included all the French settlements near the St.\r\nLawrence. Cape Breton was joined to Nova Scotia. On the south Georgia was\r\nextended to the St. Mary's River. Florida was divided into two provinces\r\nby the Appalachicola. The interior country from Lake Ontario to the Gulf\r\nwas added to no colony, and a special instruction forbade the governors to\r\nexercise jurisdiction west of the mountains. In Georgia alone did the\r\ngovernor's command cover the region west to the Mississippi. The evident\r\nexpectation was that the interior would be formed into separate colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. THE COLONIES DURING THE WAR (1754-1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Internal quarrels.]\r\n\r\nSeven years of war from 1754 to 1760, and two years more of military\r\nexcitement, had brought about significant changes in the older colonies.\r\nIt was a period of great expenditure of men and money. Thirty thousand\r\nlives had been lost. The more vigorous and more exposed colonies had laid\r\nheavy taxes and incurred burdensome debts. The constant pressure of the\r\ngovernors for money had aggravated the old quarrels with the assemblies.\r\nThe important towns were all on tide water, and not one was taken or even\r\nthreatened; hence the sufferings of the frontiersmen were not always\r\nappreciated by the colonial governments. In Pennsylvania the Indians were\r\npermitted to harry the frontier while the governor and the assembly were\r\nin a deadlock over the question of taxes on proprietary lands. Braddock's\r\nexpedition in 1755 was intended to assert the claim of the English to\r\nterritory in the limits of Pennsylvania; but it had no aid from the\r\nprovince thus concerned. Twice the peaceful Franklin stepped forward as\r\nthe organizer of military resistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English control.]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the war Massachusetts took the lead, inasmuch as her\r\ngovernor, Shirley, was made commander-in-chief. Military and civil control\r\nover the colonies was, during the war, divided in an unaccustomed fashion.\r\nThe English commanders, and even Governor Dinwiddie, showed their opinion\r\nof the Provincials by rating all their commissions lower than those of the\r\nlowest rank of regular British officers. The consequence was that George\r\nWashington for a time resigned from the service. In 1757 there was a\r\nserious dissension between Loudoun and the Massachusetts assembly, because\r\nhe insisted on quartering his troops in Boston. At first the colonies were\r\ncalled on to furnish contingents at their own expense: Pitt's more liberal\r\npolicy was to ask the colonies to furnish troops, who were paid from the\r\nBritish military chest. New England, as a populous region near the seat of\r\nhostilities, made great efforts; in the last three campaigns Massachusetts\r\nkept up every year five to seven thousand troops, and expended altogether\r\n£500,000. The other colonies, particularly Connecticut, made similar\r\nsacrifices, and the little colony of New York came out with a debt of\r\n$1,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonial trade.]\r\n\r\nAs often happens during a war, some parts of the country prospered,\r\nnotwithstanding the constant loss. New England fisheries and trade were\r\nlittle affected except when, in 1758, Loudoun shut up the ports by a brief\r\nembargo. As soon as Fort Duquesne was captured, settlers began to pass\r\nacross the mountains into western Pennsylvania, and what is now Kentucky\r\nand eastern Tennessee. The Virginia troops received ample bounty lands;\r\nWashington was shrewd enough to buy up claims, and located about seventy\r\nthousand acres. The period of 1760 to 1763 was favorable to the colonies.\r\nTheir trade with the West Indies was large. For their food products they\r\ngot sugar and molasses; from the molasses they made rum; with the rum they\r\nbought slaves in Africa, and brought them to the West Indies and to the\r\ncontinent. The New Englanders fitted out and provisioned the British\r\nfleets. They supplied the British armies in America. They did not hesitate\r\nto trade with the enemy's colonies, or with the enemy direct, if the\r\nopportunity offered. The conclusion of peace checked this brisk trade and\r\ncommercial activity. When the war was ended the agreeable irregularities\r\nstood more clearly revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. POLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE WAR (1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free from border wars.]\r\n[Sidenote: Pontiac's conspiracy.]\r\n\r\nIn government as well as in trade a new era came to the colonies in 1763.\r\nNine years had brought about many changes in the social and political\r\nconditions of the people. In the first place, they no longer had any\r\ncivilized enemies. The Canadians, to be sure, were still mistrusted as\r\npapists; but though the colonists had no love for them, they had no fear\r\nof them; and twelve years later, at the outbreak of the Revolution, they\r\ntried to establish political brotherhood with them. The colonies were now\r\nfree to expand westward, or would have been free, except for the\r\nresistance of the Western Indians gathered about the Upper Lakes. In 1763\r\nPontiac organized them in the most formidable Indian movement of American\r\nhistory. He had courage; he had statesmanship; he had large numbers. By\r\nthis time the British had learned the border warfare, and Pontiac was with\r\ndifficulty beaten. From that time until well into the Revolution Indian\r\nwarfare meant only the resistance of scattered tribes to the steady\r\nwestward advance of the English.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military experience.]\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their history the colonists had participated in\r\nlarge military operations. Abercrombie and Amherst each had commanded from\r\ntwelve to fifteen thousand men. The colonists were expert in\r\nfortification. Many Provincials had seen fighting in line and in the\r\nwoods. Israel Putnam had been captured, and the fires lighted to burn him;\r\nand Washington had learned in the hard school of frontier warfare both to\r\nfight, and to hold fast without fighting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: United action.]\r\n\r\nThe war had further served to sharpen the political sense of the people.\r\nYear after year the assemblies had engaged in matters of serious moment\r\nThey laid heavy taxes and collected them; they discussed foreign policy\r\nand their own defence; they protested against acts of the British\r\ngovernment which affected them. Although no union had been formed at\r\nAlbany in 1754, the colonies had frequently acted together and fought\r\ntogether. New York had been in great part a community of Dutch people\r\nunder English rule during the war; now, as most exposed to French attack,\r\nit became the central colony. Military men and civilians from the\r\ndifferent colonies learned to know each other at Fort William Henry and at\r\nCrown Point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scheme of British control.]\r\n[Sidenote: Theory of co-operation.]\r\n[Sidenote: Proposed taxes.]\r\n[Sidenote: Navigation Acts.]\r\n\r\nThis unwonted sense of power and of common interest was increased by the\r\npressure of the British government. Just before the war broke out, plans\r\nhad been set on foot in England to curb the colonies; legislation was to\r\nbe more carefully revised; governors were to be instructed to hold out\r\nagainst their assemblies; the Navigation Acts were to be enforced. The\r\nscheme was dropped when the war began, because the aid of the colonies in\r\ntroops and supplies was essential. Then arose two rival theories as to the\r\nnature of the war. The British took the ground that they were sending\r\ntroops to protect the colonies from French invasion, and that all their\r\nexpeditions were benefactions to the colonies. The colonists felt that\r\nthey were co-operating with England in breaking down a national enemy, and\r\nthat all their grants were bounties. The natural corollary of the first\r\ntheory was that the colonies ought at least to support the troops thus\r\ngenerously sent them; and various suggestions looking to this end were\r\nmade by royal governors. Thus Shirley in 1756 devised a general system of\r\ntaxation, including import duties, an excise, and a poll-tax; delinquents\r\nto be brought to terms by \"warrants of distress and imprisonment of\r\npersons.\" When, in 1762, Governor Bernard of Massachusetts promised £400\r\nin bounties on the faith of the colony, James Otis protested that he had\r\n\"involved their most darling privilege, the right of originating taxes.\"\r\nOn the other hand, the colonies systematically broke the Navigation Acts,\r\nof which they had never denied the legality. To organize the control over\r\nthe colonies more carefully, to provide a colonial revenue for general\r\ncolonial purposes, to execute the Navigation Acts, and thus to confine the\r\ncolonial trade to the mother-country,--these were the elements of the\r\nEnglish colonial policy from 1763 to 1775. Before these ends were\r\naccomplished the colonies had revolted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION (1763-1765.)\r\n\r\n\r\n21.

THE CONDITION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE (1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England's greatness.]\r\n\r\nIn 1763 the English were the most powerful nation in the world. The\r\nBritish islands, with a population of but 8,000,000 were the\r\nadministrative centre of a vast colonial empire. Besides their American\r\npossessions, the English had a foothold in Africa through the possession\r\nof the former Dutch Cape Colony, and had laid the foundation of the\r\npresent Indian Empire; small islands scattered through many seas furnished\r\nnaval stations and points of defence. The situation of England bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to the situation of Athens at the close of the\r\nPersian wars: a trading nation, a naval power, a governing race, a\r\nsuccessful military people; the English completed the parallel by\r\ntightening the reins upon their colonies till they revolted. Of the other\r\nEuropean powers, Portugal and Spain still preserved colonial empires in\r\nthe West; but Spain was decaying. Great Britain had not only gained\r\nterritory and prestige from the war, she had risen rich and prosperous,\r\nand a national debt of one hundred and forty million pounds was borne\r\nwithout serious difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English government.]\r\n\r\nIt was a time of vigorous intellectual life, the period of Goldsmith,\r\nEdmund Burke, and Dr. Johnson. It was also a period of political\r\ndevelopment. The conditions seemed favorable for internal peace and for\r\neasy relations with the colonies. The long Jacobite movement had come to\r\nan end; George the Third was accepted by all classes and all parties as\r\nthe legitimate sovereign. The system of government worked out in the\r\npreceding fifty years seemed well established; the ministers still\r\ngoverned through their control of Parliament; but the great Tory families,\r\nwhich for two generations had been excluded from the administration, were\r\nnow coming forward. A new element in the government of England was the\r\ndetermination of George the Third to be an active political force. From\r\nhis accession, in 1760, he had striven to build up a faction of personal\r\nadherents, popularly known as the \"king's friends;\" and he had broken down\r\nevery combination of ministers which showed itself opposed to him.\r\nAlthough the nation was not yet conscious of it, the forces were at work\r\nwhich eventually were to create a party advocating the king's prerogative,\r\nand another party representing the right of the English people to govern\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect on the colonies.]\r\n\r\nThis change in political conditions could not but affect the English\r\ncolonial policy. The king's imperious tone was reflected in all\r\ndepartments, and was especially positive when the colonies began to\r\nresist. It cannot be said that English parties divided on the question of\r\ngoverning the colonies, but when the struggle was once begun, the king's\r\nbitterest opponents fiercely criticised his policy, and made the cause of\r\nthe colonists their own. The great struggle with the colonies thus became\r\na part of the struggle between popular and autocratic principles of\r\ngovernment in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. NEW SCHEMES OF COLONIAL CONTROL (1763).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grenville's colonial policy.]\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made (§ 19) to vague schemes of colonial control\r\nsuggested during the war. More serious measures were impending. When\r\nGeorge Grenville became the head of the cabinet, in April, 1763, he took\r\nup and elaborated three distinctly new lines of policy, which grew to be\r\nthe direct causes of the American Revolution. The first was the rigid\r\nexecution of the Acts of Trade; the second was the taxation of the\r\ncolonies for the partial support of British garrisons; the third was the\r\npermanent establishment of British troops in America. What was the purpose\r\nof each of these groups of measures?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navigation acts.]\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the system.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the first series was simply to secure obedience to the\r\nNavigation Acts (Colonies, Section 44, 128),--laws long on the statute\r\nbook, and admitted by most Americans to be legal. The Acts were intended\r\nsimply to secure to the mother-country the trade of the colonies; they\r\nwere in accordance with the practice of other nations; they were far\r\nmilder than the similar systems of France and Spain, because they gave to\r\ncolonial vessels and to colonial merchants the same privileges as those\r\nenjoyed by English ship-owners and traders. The Acts dated from 1645, but\r\nhad repeatedly been re-enacted and enlarged, and from time to time more\r\nefficient provision was made for their enforcement. In the first place,\r\nthe Navigation Acts required that all the colonial trade should be carried\r\non in ships built and owned in England or the colonies. In the second\r\nplace, most of the colonial products were included in a list of\r\n\"enumerated goods,\" which could be sent abroad, even in English or\r\ncolonial vessels, only to English ports. The intention was to give to\r\nEnglish home merchants a middleman's profit in the exchange of American\r\nfor foreign goods. Among the enumerated goods were tobacco, sugar, indigo,\r\ncopper, and furs, most of them produced by the tropical and sub-tropical\r\ncolonies. Lumber, provisions, and fish were usually not enumerated; and\r\nnaval stores, such as tar, hemp, and masts, even received an English\r\nbounty. In 1733 was passed the \"Sugar Act,\" by which prohibitory duties\r\nwere laid on sugar and molasses imported from foreign colonies to the\r\nEnglish plantations, Many of these provisions little affected the\r\ncontinental colonies, and in some respects were favorable to them. Thus\r\nthe restriction of trade to English and colonial vessels stimulated ship-\r\nbuilding and the shipping interest in the colonies. From 1772 to 1775 more\r\nthan two thousand vessels were built in America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illegal trade.]\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of enforcement.]\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty with the system arose out of the obstinate\r\ndetermination of the colonies, especially in New England, to trade with\r\ntheir French and Spanish neighbors in the West Indies, with or without\r\npermission: they were able in those markets to sell qualities of fish and\r\nlumber for which there was no demand in England. Well might it have been\r\nsaid, as a governor of Virginia had said a century earlier: \"Mighty and\r\ndestructive have been the obstructions to our trade and navigation by that\r\nsevere Act of Parliament,... for all are most obedient to the laws, while\r\nNew England men break through them and trade to any place where their\r\ninterests lead them to.\" The colonists were obliged to register their\r\nships; it was a common practice to register them at much below their\r\nactual tonnage, or to omit the ceremony altogether. Colonial officials\r\ncould not be depended upon to detect or to punish infractions of the Acts,\r\nand for that purpose the English Government had placed customs officers in\r\nthe principal ports. Small duties were laid on imports, not to furnish\r\nrevenue, but rather to furnish fees for those officers. The amount thus\r\ncollected was not more than two thousand pounds a year; and the necessary\r\nsalaries, aggregating between seven and eight thousand pounds, were paid\r\nby the British government.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. WRITS OF ASSISTANCE (1761-1764).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Smuggling.]\r\n[Sidenote: Argument of James Otis.]\r\n\r\nUnder the English acts violation of the Navigation Laws was smuggling, and\r\nwas punishable in the usual courts. Two practical difficulties had always\r\nbeen found in prosecutions, and they were much increased as soon as a more\r\nvigorous execution was entered upon. It was hard to secure evidence, for\r\nsmuggled goods, once landed, rapidly disappeared; and the lower colonial\r\njudges were both to deal severely with their brethren, engaged in a\r\nbusiness which public sentiment did not condemn. In 1761 an attempt was\r\nmade in Massachusetts to avoid both these difficulties through the use of\r\nthe familiar Writs of Assistance. These were legal processes by which\r\nauthority was given to custom-house officers to make search for smuggled\r\ngoods; since they were general in their terms and authorized the search of\r\nany premises by day, they might have been made the means of vexatious\r\nvisits and interference. In February, 1761, an application for such a writ\r\nwas brought before the Superior Court of Massachusetts, which was not\r\nsubject to popular influence. James Otis, advocate-general of the colony,\r\nresigned his office rather than plead the cause of the government, and\r\nbecame the leading counsel in opposition. The arguments in favor of the\r\nwrit were that without some such process the laws could not be executed,\r\nand that similar writs were authorized by English statutes. Otis in his\r\nplea insisted that no English statute applied to the colonies unless they\r\nwere specially mentioned, and that hence English precedents had no\r\napplication. But he went far beyond the legal principles involved. He\r\ndeclared in plain terms that the Navigation Acts were \"a taxation law made\r\nby a foreign legislature without our consent.\" He asserted that the Acts\r\nof Trade were \"irreconcilable with the colonial charters, and hence were\r\nvoid.\" He declared that there were \"rights derived only from nature and\r\nthe Author of nature;\" that they were \"inherent, inalienable, and\r\nindefeasible by any laws, pacts, contracts, governments, or stipulations\r\nwhich man could devise.\" The court, after inquiring into the practice in\r\nEngland, issued the writs to the custom-house officers, although it does\r\nnot appear that they made use of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the discussion.]\r\n\r\nThe practical effect of Otis's speech has been much exaggerated. John\r\nAdams, who heard and took notes on the argument, declared, years later,\r\nthat \"American independence was then born,\" and that \"Mr. Otis's oration\r\nagainst Writs of Assistance breathed into this nation the breath of life.\"\r\nThe community was not conscious at the time that a new and startling\r\ndoctrine had been put forth, or that loyalty to England was involved. The\r\narguments drawn from the rights of man and the supremacy of the charters\r\nwere of a kind familiar to the colonists. The real novelty was the bold\r\napplication of these principles, the denial of the legality of a system\r\nmore than a century old.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enforcement.]\r\n\r\nSo far was the home government from accepting these doctrines that in 1763\r\nthe offensive Sugar Act was renewed. New import duties were laid, and more\r\nstringent provisions made for enforcing the Acts of Trade; and the ground\r\nwas prepared for a permanent and irritating controversy, by commissioning\r\nthe naval officers stationed on the American coast as revenue officials,\r\nwith power to make seizures.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. THE STAMP ACT (1763-1765).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plan for a stamp duty.]\r\n[Sidenote: Questions of troops.]\r\n\r\nThe next step in colonial control met an unexpected and violent\r\nresistance. In the winter of 1763-1764 Grenville, then English prime\r\nminister, called together the agents of the colonies and informed them\r\nthat he proposed to lay a small tax upon the colonies, and that it would\r\ntake the form of a stamp duty, unless they suggested some other method.\r\nWhy should England tax the colonies? Because it had been determined to\r\nplace a permanent force of about ten thousand men in America. A few more\r\nEnglish garrisons would have been of great assistance in 1754; the Pontiac\r\noutbreak of 1763 had been suppressed only by regular troops who happened\r\nto be in the country; and in case of later wars the colonies were likely\r\nto be attacked by England's enemies. On the other hand, the colonies had\r\nasked for no troops, and desired none. They were satisfied with their own\r\nhalting and inefficient means of defence; they no longer had French\r\nenemies in Canada, and they felt what seems an unreasonable fear that the\r\ntroops would be used to take away their liberty. From the beginning to the\r\nend of the struggle it was never proposed that Americans should be taxed\r\nfor the support of the home government, or even for the full support of\r\nthe colonial army. It was supposed that a revenue of one hundred thousand\r\npounds would be raised, which would meet one-third of the necessary\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stamp Act passed.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding colonial objections to a standing army, garrisons would\r\ndoubtless have been received but for the accompanying proposition to tax.\r\nOn March 10, 1764, preliminary resolutions passed the House of Commons\r\nlooking towards the Stamp Act. There was no suggestion that the\r\nproposition was illegal; the chief objection was summed up by Beckford, of\r\nLondon, in a phrase: \"As we are stout, I hope we shall be merciful.\"\r\n\r\nThe news produced instant excitement in the colonies. First was urged the\r\npractical objection that the tax would draw from the country the little\r\nspecie which it contained. The leading argument was that taxation without\r\nrepresentation was illegal. The remonstrances, by an error of the agents\r\nwho had them in charge, were not presented until too late. Franklin and\r\nothers protested to the ministry, and declared the willingness of the\r\ncolonies to pay taxes assessed in a lump sum on each colony. Grenville\r\nsilenced them by asking in what way those lump sums should be apportioned.\r\nAfter a short debate in Parliament the Act was passed by a vote of 205 to\r\n49. Barré, one of the members who spoke against it, alluded to the\r\nagitators in the colonies as \"Sons of Liberty;\" the phrase was taken up in\r\nthe colonies, and made a party war-cry. George the Third was at that\r\nmoment insane, and the Act was signed by a commission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expectations of success.]\r\n\r\nResistance in the colonies was not expected. Franklin thought that the Act\r\nwould go into effect; even Otis said that it ought to be obeyed. It laid a\r\nmoderate stamp-duty on the papers necessary for legal and commercial\r\ntransactions. At the request of the ministry, the colonial agents\r\nsuggested as stamp collectors some of the most respected and eminent men\r\nin each colony. Almost at the same time was passed an act somewhat\r\nrelaxing the Navigation Laws; but a Quartering Act was also passed, by\r\nwhich the colonists were obliged, even in time of peace, to furnish the\r\ntroops who might be stationed among them with quarters and with certain\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. THE STAMP ACT CONGRESS (1765.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Internal and external taxes.]\r\n\r\nIssue was now joined on the question which eventually separated the\r\ncolonies from the mother-country. Parliament had asserted its right to lay\r\ntaxes on the colonists for imperial purposes. The colonies had up to this\r\ntime held governmental relations only with the Crown, from whom came their\r\ncharters. They had escaped taxation because they were poor, and because\r\nhitherto they had not occasioned serious expense; but they had accepted\r\nthe small import duties. They found it hard to reconcile obedience to one\r\nset of laws with resistance to the other; and they therefore insisted that\r\nthere was a distinction between \"external taxation\" and \"internal\r\ntaxation,\" between duties levied at the ports and duties levied within the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remonstrances.]\r\n\r\nThe moment the news reached America, opposition sprang up in many\r\ndifferent forms. The colonial legislatures preferred dignified\r\nremonstrance. The Virginia Assembly reached a farther point in a set of\r\nbold resolutions, passed May 29, 1765, under the influence of a speech by\r\nPatrick Henry. They asserted \"that the General Assembly of this colony\r\nhave the only and sole exclusive right and power to lay taxes and\r\nimpositions upon the inhabitants of this colony;\" and that the Stamp Act\"\r\nhas a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as American freedom.\"\r\nOn June 8, 1765, Massachusetts suggested another means of remonstrance, by\r\ncalling upon her sister colonies to send delegates to New York \"to\r\nconsider of a general and united, dutiful, loyal, and humble\r\nrepresentation of their condition to his Majesty and to the Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riots.]\r\n[Sidenote: Non-Importation.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile opposition had broken out in open violence. In August there were\r\nriots in Boston; the house of Oliver, appointed as collector of the stamp\r\ntaxes, was attacked, and he next day resigned his office. Hutchinson was\r\nacting governor of the colony: his mansion was sacked; and the manuscript\r\nof his History of Massachusetts, still preserved, carries on its edges the\r\nmud of the Boston streets into which it was thrown. The town of Boston\r\ndeclared itself \"particularly alarmed and astonished at the Act called the\r\nStamp Act, by which we apprehend a very grievous tax is to be laid upon\r\nthe colonies.\" In other colonies there were similar, though less violent,\r\nscenes. Still another form of resistance was suggested by the\r\norganizations called \"Sons of Liberty,\" the members of which agreed to buy\r\nno more British goods. When the time came for putting the act into force,\r\nevery person appointed as collector had resigned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stamp Act Congress.]\r\n\r\nThese three means of resistance--protest, riots, and non-importation--were\r\npowerfully supplemented by the congress which assembled at New York, Oct.\r\n1765. It included some of the ablest men from nine colonies. Such men as\r\nJames Otis, Livingston of New York, Rutledge of South Carolina, and John\r\nDickinson of Pennsylvania, met, exchanged views, and promised co-\r\noperation. It was the first unmistakable evidence that the colonies would\r\nmake common cause. After a session of two weeks the congress adjourned,\r\nhaving drawn up petitions to the English government, and a \"Declaration of\r\nRights and Grievances of the Colonists in America.\" In this document they\r\ndeclared themselves entitled to the rights of other Englishmen. They\r\nasserted, on the one hand, that they could not be represented in the\r\nBritish House of Commons, and on the other that they could not be taxed by\r\na body in which they had no representation. They complained of the Stamp\r\nAct, and no less of the amendments to the Acts of Trade, which, they said,\r\nwould \"render them unable to purchase the manufactures of Great Britain.\"\r\nIn these memorials there is no threat of resistance, but the general\r\nattitude of the colonies showed that it was unsafe to push the matter\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repeal of the Stamp Act.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Grenville ministry had given place to another Whig ministry\r\nunder Rockingham, who felt no responsibility for the Stamp Act. Pitt took\r\nthe ground that \"the government of Great Britain could not lay taxes on\r\nthe colonies.\" Benjamin Franklin was called before a committee, and urged\r\nthe withdrawal of the act. The king, who had now recovered his health,\r\ngave it to be understood that he was for repeal. The repeal bill was\r\npassed by a majority of more than two to one, and the crisis was avoided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Right of taxation asserted.]\r\n\r\nTo give up the whole principle seemed to the British government\r\nimpossible; the repeal was therefore accompanied by the so-called\r\nDependency Act. This set forth that the colonies are \"subordinate unto and\r\ndependent upon the Imperial Crown and Parliament of Great Britain, and\r\nthat Parliament hath, and of right ought to have, full power to make laws\r\nand statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and\r\npeople of America subjects to the Crown of Great Britain in all cases\r\nwhatsoever.\" Apparently matters had returned to their former course. The\r\ngratitude of the colonies was loudly expressed; but they had learned the\r\neffect of a united protest, they had learned how to act together, and they\r\nwere irritated by the continued assertion of the power of Parliament to\r\ntax and otherwise to govern the colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. REVENUE ACTS (1767).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Townshend's plans.]\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrel with New York.]\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act removed the difficulty without removing the\r\ncause. The year 1766 was marked in English politics by the virtual\r\nretirement of Pitt from the government. His powerful opposition to\r\ntaxation of the colonies was thus removed, and Charles Townshend became\r\nthe leading spirit in the ministry. Jan. 26, 1767, he said in the House of\r\nCommons: \"I know a mode in which a revenue may be drawn from America\r\nwithout offence.... England is undone if this taxation of America is given\r\nup.\" And he pledged himself to find a revenue nearly sufficient to meet\r\nthe military expenses in America. At the moment that the question of\r\ntaxation was thus revived, the New York Assembly became involved in a\r\ndispute with the home government by declining to furnish the necessary\r\nsupplies for the troops. An Act of Parliament was therefore passed\r\ndeclaring the action of the New York legislature null,--a startling\r\nassertion of a power of disallowance by Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enforcement.]\r\n\r\nThe three parts of the general scheme for controlling the colonies were\r\nnow all taken up again. For their action against the troops the New York\r\nAssembly was suspended,--the first instance in which Parliament had\r\nundertaken to destroy an effective part of the colonial government. For\r\nthe execution of the Navigation Acts a board of commissioners of customs\r\nwas established, with large powers. In June, 1767, a new Taxation Act was\r\nintroduced, and rapidly passed through Parliament. In order to avoid the\r\nobjections to \"internal taxes,\" it laid import duties on glass, and white\r\nlead, painters' colors, paper, and tea. The proceeds of the Act, estimated\r\nat, £40,000, were to pay governors and judges in America. Writs of\r\nAssistance were made legal. A few months afterwards,--December, 1767,--a\r\ncolonial department was created, headed by a secretary of state. The whole\r\nmachinery of an exasperating control was thus provided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of right of taxation.]\r\n\r\nIssue was once more joined both in England and America on the\r\nconstitutional power of taxation. The great principle of English law that\r\ntaxation was not a right, but a gift of the persons taxed through their\r\nrepresentatives, was claimed also by the colonies. Opinions had repeatedly\r\nbeen given by the law officers of the Crown that a colony could be taxed\r\nonly by its own representatives. The actual amount of money called for was\r\ntoo small to burden them, but it was to be applied in such a way as to\r\nmake the governors and judges independent of the assemblies. The principle\r\nof taxation, once admitted, might be carried farther. As an English\r\nofficial of the time remarked: \"The Stamp Act attacked colonial ideas by\r\nsap; the Townshend scheme was attacking them by storm every day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n28. COLONIAL PROTESTS AND REPEAL (1767-1770).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonial protest.]\r\n[Sidenote: Massachusetts circular.]\r\n[Sidenote: Coercive measures.]\r\n\r\nThis time the colonies avoided the error of disorderly or riotous\r\nopposition. The leading men resolved to act together through protests by\r\nthe colonial legislatures and through non-importation agreements. Public\r\nfeeling ran high. In Pennsylvania John Dickinson in his \"Letters of a\r\nFarmer\" pointed out that \"English history affords examples of resistance\r\nby force.\" Another non-importation scheme was suggested by Virginia, but\r\nwas on the whole unsuccessful. In February, 1768, Massachusetts sent out a\r\ncircular letter to the other colonies, inviting concerted protests, and\r\ndeclaring that the new laws were unconstitutional. The protest was\r\nmoderate, its purpose legal; but the ministry attempted to destroy its\r\neffect by three new repressive measures. The first of them, April, 1768,\r\ndirected the governors, upon any attempt to pass protesting resolutions,\r\nto prorogue their assemblies. The second was the despatch of troops to\r\nBoston: they arrived at the end of September, and remained until the\r\noutbreak of the Revolution. The third coercive step was a proposition to\r\nsend American agitators to England for trial, under an obsolete statute of\r\nHenry the Eighth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the tax.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the duties had been levied. The result was the actual payment of\r\nabout sixteen thousand pounds; this sum was offset by expenses of\r\ncollection amounting to more than fifteen thousand pounds, and\r\nextraordinary military expenditures of one hundred and seventy thousand\r\npounds. Once more the ministry found no financial advantage and great\r\npractical difficulties in the way of colonial taxation. Once more they\r\ndetermined to withdraw from an untenable position, and once more, under\r\nthe active influence of the king and his \"friends,\" they resolved to\r\nmaintain the principle. In April, 1770, all the duties were repealed\r\nexcept that upon tea. Either the ministry should have applied the\r\nprinciple rigorously, so as to raise an adequate revenue, or they should\r\nhave given up the revenue and the principle together.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. SPIRIT OF VIOLENCE IN THE COLONIES (1770-1773).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troops in Boston.]\r\n[Sidenote: Collision with the mob.]\r\n\r\nRepeal could not destroy the feeling of injury in the minds of the\r\ncolonists; and repeal did not withdraw the coercive acts nor the troops.\r\nThe garrison in Boston, sustained at the expense of the British treasury,\r\nwas almost as offensive to the colonists of Massachusetts as if they had\r\nbeen taxed for its support. From the beginning the troops were looked upon\r\nas an alien body, placed in the town to execute unpopular and even illegal\r\nacts. There was constant friction between the officers and the town and\r\ncolonial governments, and between the populace and the troops. On the\r\nnight of March 5, 1770, an affray occurred between a mob and a squad of\r\nsoldiers. Both sides were abusive and threatening; finally the soldiers\r\nunder great provocation fired, and killed five men. The riot had no\r\npolitical significance; it was caused by no invasion upon the rights of\r\nAmericans: but, in the inflamed condition of the public mind, it was\r\ninstantly taken up, and has gone down to history under the undeserved\r\ntitle of the Boston Massacre. Next morning a town meeting unanimously\r\nvoted \"that nothing can rationally be expected to restore the peace of the\r\ntown and prevent blood and carnage but the immediate removal of the\r\ntroops.\" The protest was effectual; the troops were sent to an island in\r\nthe harbor; on the other hand, the prosecution of the soldiers concerned\r\nin the affray was allowed to slacken. For nearly two years the trouble\r\nseemed dying down in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samuel Adams.]\r\n[Sidenote: Committee of Correspondence.]\r\n\r\nThat friendly relations between the colonies and the mother-country were\r\nnot re-established is due chiefly to Samuel Adams, a member of the\r\nMassachusetts General Court from Boston. His strength lay in his\r\nvehemence, his total inability to see more than one side of any question,\r\nand still more in his subtle influence upon the Boston town meeting, upon\r\ncommittees, and in private conclaves. He seems to have determined from the\r\nbeginning that independence might come, ought to come, and must come. In\r\nNovember, 1772, he introduced into the Boston town meeting a modest\r\nproposition that \"a committee of correspondence be appointed ... to state\r\nthe Rights of the Colonists and of this Province in particular as Men, as\r\nChristians, and as Subjects;--and also request of each Town a free\r\ncommunication of their Sentiments on this subject.\" The committee blew the\r\ncoals by an enumeration of rights and grievances; but its chief service\r\nwas its unseen but efficient work of correspondence, from town to town. A\r\nfew months later the colony entered into a similar scheme for\r\ncommunication with the sister colonies. These committees of correspondence\r\nmade the Revolution possible. They disseminated arguments from province to\r\nprovince: they had lists of those ripe for resistance; they sounded\r\nlegislatures; they prepared the organization which was necessary for the\r\nfinal rising of 1774 and 1775.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Gaspee\" burned.]\r\n[Sidenote: Tea.]\r\n[Sidenote: Hutchinson letters.]\r\n[Sidenote: Boston Tea-party.]\r\n\r\nShortly before the creation of this committee, an act of violence in Rhode\r\nIsland showed the hostility to the enforcement of the Acts of Trade. The\r\n\"Gaspee,\" a royal vessel of war, had interfered legally and illegally with\r\nthe smuggling trade. On June 9, 1772, while in pursuit a vessel, she ran\r\naground. That night the ship was attacked by armed men, who captured and\r\nburned her. The colonial authorities were indifferent: the perpetrators\r\nwere not tried; they were not prosecuted; they were not even arrested. On\r\nDec. 16, 1773, a similar act of violence marked the opposition of the\r\ncolonies to the remnant of the Townshend taxation acts. The tea duty had\r\nbeen purposely reduced, till the price of tea was lower than in England.\r\nSoon after the appointment of the Committees of Correspondence public\r\nsentiment in Massachusetts was again aroused by the publication of letters\r\nwritten by Hutchinson, then governor of Massachusetts, to a private\r\ncorrespondent in England. The letters were such as any governor\r\nrepresenting the royal authority might have written. \"I wish,\" said\r\nHutchinson, \"the good of the colony when I wish to see some fresh\r\nrestraint of liberty rather than the connection with the parent state\r\nshould be broken.\" The assembly petitioned for the removal of Hutchinson,\r\nand this unfortunate quarrel was one of the causes of a decisive step, the\r\nBoston Tea-party. An effort was made to import a quantity of tea, not for\r\nthe sake of the tax, but in order to relieve the East India Company from\r\nfinancial difficulties. On December 16, the three tea ships in the harbor\r\nwere boarded by a body of men in Indian garb, and three hundred and forty-\r\ntwo chests of tea were emptied into the sea. Next morning the shoes of at\r\nleast one reputable citizen of Massachusetts were found by his family\r\nunaccountably full of tea. In other parts of the country, as at Edenton in\r\nNorth Carolina, and at Charleston in South Carolina, there was similar\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. COERCIVE ACTS OF 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public feeling in England.]\r\n\r\nThe British government had taken a false step by its legislation of 1770,\r\nbut the colonies had now put themselves in the wrong by these repeated\r\nacts of violence. There seemed left but two alternatives,--to withdraw the\r\nTea Act, and thus to remove the plea that Parliament was taxing without\r\nrepresentation; or to continue the execution of the Revenue Act firmly,\r\nbut by the usual course of law. It was not in the temper of the English\r\npeople, and still less like the king, to withdraw offensive acts in the\r\nface of such daring resistance. The failure to secure the prosecution of\r\nthe destroyers of the \"Gaspee\" caused the British government to distrust\r\nAmerican courts as well as American juries. One political writer, Dean\r\nTucker, declared that the American colonies in their defiant state had\r\nceased to be of advantage to England, and that they had better be allowed\r\nquietly to separate. Pitt denied the right to tax, but declared that if\r\nthe colonies meant to separate, he would be the first to enforce the\r\nauthority of the mother-country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coercive statutes.]\r\n[Sidenote: Quebec Act.]\r\n\r\nNeither orderly enforcement, conciliation, nor peaceful separation was the\r\npolicy selected. England committed the fatal and irremediable mistake of\r\npassing illegal statutes as a punishment for the illegal action of the\r\ncolonists. Five bills were introduced and hastily pushed through\r\nParliament. The first was meant as a punishment for the Tea-party. It\r\nenacted that no further commerce was to be permitted with the port of\r\nBoston till that town should make its submission. Burke objected to a bill\r\n\"which punishes the innocent with the guilty, and condemns without the\r\npossibility of defence.\" The second act was intended to punish the whole\r\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts, by declaring void certain provisions of the\r\ncharter granted by William III. in 1692. Of all the grievances which led\r\nto the Revolution this was the most serious, for it set up the doctrine\r\nthat charters proceeding from the Crown could be altered by statute.\r\nThenceforward Parliament was to be omnipotent in colonial matters. The\r\nthird act directed that \"Persons questioned for any Acts in Execution of\r\nthe Law\" should be sent to England for trial. It was not intended to apply\r\nto persons guilty of acts of violence, but to officers or soldiers who, in\r\nresisting riots, might have made themselves amenable to the civil law. The\r\nfourth act was a new measure providing for the quartering of soldiers upon\r\nthe inhabitants, and was intended to facilitate the establishment of a\r\ntemporary military government in Massachusetts. The fifth act had no\r\ndirect reference to Massachusetts, but was later seized upon as one of the\r\ngrievances which justified the Revolution. This was the Quebec Act,\r\nproviding for the government of the region ceded by France in 1763. It\r\ngave to the French settlers the right to have their disputes decided under\r\nthe principles of the old French civil law; it guaranteed them the right\r\nof exercising their own religion; and it annexed to Quebec the whole\r\nterritory between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and the Great Lakes. The\r\npurpose of this act was undoubtedly to remove the danger of disaffection\r\nor insurrection in Canada, and at the same time to extinguish all claims\r\nof Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Virginia to the region west of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (1774).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gage's quarrel with Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThe news of this series of coercive measures was hardly received in\r\nMassachusetts before General Gage appeared, bearing a commission to act as\r\ngovernor of the province; and in a few weeks the Port Bill and the\r\nmodifications of the charter were put in force. If the governor supposed\r\nthat Boston stood alone, he was quickly undeceived. From the other towns\r\nand from other colonies came supplies of food and sympathetic resolutions.\r\nOn June 17th, under the adroit management of Samuel Adams, the General\r\nCourt passed a resolution proposing a colonial congress, to begin\r\nSeptember 1st at Philadelphia. While the resolutions were going through,\r\nthe governor's messenger in vain knocked at the locked door, to\r\ncommunicate a proclamation dissolving the assembly. The place of that body\r\nwas for a time taken by the Committee of Correspondence, in which Samuel\r\nAdams was the leading spirit, and by local meetings and conventions. In\r\nAugust, Gage came to an open breach with the people. In accordance with\r\nthe Charter Act, he proceeded to appoint the so-called \"mandamus\"\r\ncouncillors. An irregularly elected Provincial Congress declared that it\r\nstood by the charter of 1692, under which the councillors were elected by\r\nthe General Court. The first effect of the coercive acts was, therefore,\r\nto show that the people of Massachusetts stood together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delegates chosen.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Congress.]\r\n\r\nAnother effect was to enlist the sympathy of the other colonies. The\r\nmovement for a congress plainly looked towards resistance and revolution.\r\nIn vain did the governors dissolve the assemblies that seemed disposed to\r\nsend delegates. Irregular congresses and conventions took their place, and\r\nall the colonies but Georgia somehow chose delegates. The first\r\nContinental Congress which assembled in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774,\r\nwas, therefore, a body without any legal status. It included, however,\r\nsome of the most influential men in America. From Massachusetts came\r\nSamuel Adams and John Adams; from New York, John Jay; from Virginia,\r\nPatrick Henry and George Washington. The general participation in this\r\ncongress was an assurance that all America felt the danger of\r\nparliamentary control, and the outrage upon the rights of their New\r\nEngland brethren.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of Rights.]\r\n\r\nThis feeling was voiced in the action of the Congress. Early resolutions\r\nset forth approval of the action of Massachusetts. Then came the\r\npreparation of a \"Declaration of Rights\" of the colonies, and of their\r\ngrievances. They declared that they were entitled to life, liberty, and\r\nproperty, and to the rights and immunities of free and natural born\r\nsubjects within the realm of England. They denied the right of the British\r\nParliament to legislate in cases of \"taxation and internal polity,\" but\r\n\"cheerfully consent to the operation of such Acts of the British\r\nParliament as are _bona fide_ restrained to the regulation of our external\r\ncommerce.\" They protested against \"the keeping up a standing army\r\nin these colonies in times of peace.\" They enumerated a long list of\r\nillegal Acts, including the coercive statutes and the Quebec Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Association.]\r\n\r\nThe only action of the First Continental Congress which had in any degree\r\nthe character of legislation was the \"Association,\"--the only effective\r\nnon-importation agreement in the whole struggle. The delegates united in a\r\npledge that they would import no goods from England or other English\r\ncolonies, and particularly no slaves or tea; and they recommended to the\r\ncolonies to pass efficient legislation for carrying it out. The\r\nRevolutionary \"congresses\" and \"conventions,\" and sometimes the\r\nlegislatures themselves, passed resolutions and laid penalties. A more\r\neffective measure was open violence against people who persisted in\r\nimporting, selling, or using British goods or slaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of the Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe First Continental Congress was simply the mouthpiece of the colonies.\r\nIt expressed in unmistakable terms a determination to resist what they\r\nconsidered aggressions; and it suggested as a legal and effective means of\r\nresistance that they should refuse to trade with the of mother-country.\r\nIts action, however, received the approval of an assembly or other\r\nrepresentative body in each of the twelve colonies. Before it adjourned,\r\nthe congress prepared a series of addresses and remonstrances, and voted\r\nthat if no redress of grievances should have been obtained, a second\r\ncongress should assemble in May, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES (1775).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude of the Whigs.]\r\n[Sidenote: Coercion]\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament assembled in January, 1775, it was little disposed to make\r\nconcessions; but the greatest living Englishman now came forward as the\r\ndefender of the colonies. Pitt declared that the matter could only be\r\nadjusted on the basis \"that taxation is theirs, and commercial regulation\r\nours.\" Although he was seconded by other leading Whigs, the reply of the\r\nTory ministry to the remonstrance of the colonies was a new series of\r\nacts. Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion; and the\r\nrecalcitrant colonies were forbidden to trade with Great Britain, Ireland,\r\nor the West Indies, or to take part in the Newfoundland fisheries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affairs in Massachusetts.]\r\n[Sidenote: Lexington and Concord.]\r\n\r\nBefore these acts could be known in America, matters had already drifted\r\nto a point where neither coercion nor conciliation could effect anything.\r\nThrough the winter 1774-1775 Gage lay for the most part in Boston, unable\r\nto execute his commission outside of his military lines, and unwilling to\r\nsummon a legislature which was certain to oppose him. The courts were\r\nbroken up, jurors could not be obtained, the whole machinery of government\r\nwas stopped. Meanwhile, in February, 1775, the people had a second time\r\nelected a provincial congress, which acted for the time being as their\r\ngovernment. This body prepared to raise a military force, and asked aid of\r\nother New England colonies. April 19, 1775, a British expedition was sent\r\nfrom Boston to Lexington and Concord to seize military stores there\r\nassembled for the use of the provincial forces. The British were\r\nconfronted on the village green of Lexington by about one hundred\r\nmilitiamen, who refused to disperse, and were fired upon by the British.\r\nAt Concord the British found and destroyed the stores, but were attacked\r\nand obliged to retire, and finally returned to Boston with a loss of three\r\nhundred men. The war had begun. Its issue depended upon the moral and\r\nmilitary support which Massachusetts might receive from the other\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. JUSTIFICATION OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Malcontents put down.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of Massachusetts was unhesitatingly taken up by all the\r\ncolonies, from New Hampshire to Georgia. America was united. This\r\nunanimity proceeded, however, not from the people, but from suddenly\r\nconstituted revolutionary governments. No view of the Revolution could be\r\njust which does not recognize the fact that in no colony was there a large\r\nmajority in favor of resistance, and in some the patriots were undoubtedly\r\nin a minority. The movement, started by a few seceders, carried with it a\r\nlarge body of men who were sincerely convinced that the British government\r\nwas tyrannical. The majorities thus formed, silenced the minority,\r\nsometimes by mere intimidation, sometimes by ostracism, often by flagrant\r\nviolence. One kind of pressure was felt by old George Watson of Plymouth,\r\nbending his bald head over his cane, as his neighbors one by one left the\r\nchurch in which he sat, because they would not associate with a \"mandamus\r\ncouncillor.\" A different argument was employed on Judge James Smith of New\r\nYork, in his coat of tar and feathers, the central figure of a shameful\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early organization.]\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the sudden strength shown by the Revolutionary movement\r\nwas that the patriots were organized and the friends of the established\r\ngovernment did not know their own strength. The agent of British influence\r\nin almost every colony was the governor. In 1775 the governors were all\r\ndriven out. There was no centre of resistance about which the loyalists\r\ncould gather. The patriots had seized the reins of government before their\r\nopponents fairly understood that they had been dropped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feeling of common interest.]\r\n\r\nAnother influence which hastened the Revolution was a desire to supplant\r\nthe men highest in official life. There was no place in the colonial\r\ngovernment for a Samuel Adams or a John Adams while the Hutchinsons and\r\nthe Olivers were preferred. But no personal ambitions can account for the\r\nagreement of thirteen colonies having so many points of dissimilarity. The\r\nmerchants of Boston and New Haven, the townsmen of Concord and Pomfret,\r\nthe farmers of the Hudson and Delaware valleys, and the aristocratic\r\nplanters of Virginia and South Carolina, deliberately went to war rather\r\nthan submit. The causes of the Revolution were general, were wide-spread,\r\nand were keenly felt by Americans of every class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance of taxation.]\r\n\r\nThe grievance most strenuously put forward was that of \"taxation without\r\nrepresentation.\" On this point the colonists were supported by the\r\npowerful authority of Pitt and other English statesmen, and by an unbroken\r\nline of precedent. They accepted \"external taxation;\" at the beginning of\r\nthe struggle they professed a willingness to pay requisitions apportioned\r\nin lump sums on the colonies; they were accustomed to heavy taxation for\r\nlocal purposes; in the years immediately preceding the Revolution the\r\npeople of Massachusetts annually raised about ten shillings per head. They\r\nsincerely objected to taxation of a new kind, for a purpose which did not\r\ninterest them, by a power which they could not control. The cry of\r\n\"Taxation without representation\" had great popular effect. It was simple,\r\nit was universal, it sounded like tyranny.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance of garrisons.]\r\n\r\nA greater and more keenly felt grievance was the establishment of\r\ngarrisons. The colonies were willing to run their own risk of enemies.\r\nThey asserted that the real purpose of the troops was to overawe their\r\ngovernments. The despatch of the regiments to Boston in 1768 was plainly\r\nintended to subdue a turbulent population. The British government made a\r\nserious mistake in insisting upon this point, whether with or without\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance to Acts of Trade.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most effective cause of the Revolution was the English\r\ncommercial system. One reason why a tax was felt to be so great a hardship\r\nwas, that the colonies were already paying a heavy indirect tribute to the\r\nBritish nation, by the limitations on their trade. The fact that French\r\nand Spanish colonists suffered more than they did, was no argument to\r\nEnglishmen accustomed in most ways to regulate themselves. The commercial\r\nsystem might have been enforced; perhaps a tax might have been laid: the\r\ntwo together made a grievance which the colonies would not endure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stand for the charters.]\r\n\r\nThe coercive acts of 1774 gave a definite object for the general\r\nindignation. In altering the government of Massachusetts they destroyed\r\nthe security of all the colonies. The Crown was held unable to withdraw a\r\nprivilege once granted; Parliament might, however, undo to-morrow what it\r\nhad done to-day. The instinct of the Americans was for a rigid\r\nconstitution, unalterable by the ordinary forms of law. They were right in\r\ncalling the coercive acts unconstitutional. They were contrary to the\r\ncharters, they were contrary to precedent, and in the minds of the\r\ncolonists the charters and precedent, taken together, formed an\r\nirrepealable body of law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppression not grievous.]\r\n[Sidenote: Restraints on trade.]\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance to one-man power.]\r\n\r\nIn looking back over this crisis, it is difficult to see that the\r\ncolonists had suffered grievous oppression. The taxes had not taken four\r\nhundred thousand pounds out of their pockets in ten years. The armies had\r\ncost them nothing, and except in Boston had not interfered with the\r\ngovernments. The Acts of Trade were still systematically evaded, and the\r\nbattle of Lexington came just in time to relieve John Hancock from the\r\nnecessity of appearing before the court to answer to a charge of\r\nsmuggling. The real justification of the Revolution is not to be found in\r\nthe catalogue of grievances drawn up by the colonies. The Revolution was\r\nright because it represented two great principles of human progress. In\r\nthe first place, as the Americans grew in importance, in numbers, and in\r\nwealth, they felt more and more indignant that their trade should be\r\nhampered for the benefit of men over seas. They represented the principle\r\nof the right of an individual to the products of his own industry; and\r\ntheir success has opened to profitable trade a thousand ports the world\r\nover. In the second place the Revolution was a resistance to arbitrary\r\npower. That arbitrary power was exercised by the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain; but, at that moment, by a combination which threatened the\r\nexistence of popular government in England, the king was the ruling spirit\r\nover Parliament. The colonists represented the same general principles as\r\nthe minority in England. As Sir Edward Thornton said, when minister of\r\nGreat Britain to the United States, in 1879: \"Englishmen now understand\r\nthat in the American Revolution you were fighting our battles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nUNION AND INDEPENDENCE (1775-1783).\r\n\r\n\r\n34.

THE STRENGTH OF THE COMBATANTS (1775).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of Great Britain.]\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the population and resources of the two countries, the\r\ndefiance of the colonists seems almost foolhardy. In 1775 England,\r\nIreland, and Scotland together had from eight to ten million souls; while\r\nthe colonies numbered but three millions. Great Britain had a considerable\r\nsystem of manufactures, and the greatest foreign commerce in the world,\r\nand rich colonies in every quarter of the globe poured wealth into her\r\nlap. What she lacked she could buy. In the year 1775 the home government\r\nraised ten million pounds in taxes, and when the time came she was able to\r\nborrow hundreds of millions in all the colonies together, two million\r\npounds in money was the utmost that could be raised in a single year by\r\nany system of taxes or loans. In 1776 one hundred and thirty cruisers and\r\ntransports brought the British army to New York: the whole American navy\r\nhad not more than seventeen vessels. In moral resources Great Britain was\r\ndecidedly stronger than America. Parliament was divided, but the king was\r\ndetermined. On Oct 15, 1775, he wrote: \"Every means of distressing America\r\nmust meet with my concurrence.\" Down to 1778 the war was popular in\r\nEngland, and interfered little with her prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of America.]\r\n\r\nHow was it in America? Canada, the Floridas, the West Indies, and Nova\r\nScotia held off. Of the three millions of population, five hundred\r\nthousand were negro slaves, carried no muskets, and caused constant fear\r\nof revolt. John Adams has said that more than a third part of the\r\nprincipal men in America were throughout opposed to the Revolution; and of\r\nthose who agreed with the principles of the Revolution, thousands thought\r\nthem not worth fighting for. There were rivalries and jealousies between\r\nAmerican public men and between the sections. The troops of one New\r\nEngland State refused to serve under officers from another State. The\r\nwhole power of England could be concentrated upon the struggle, and the\r\nRevolution would have been crushed in a single year if the eyes of the\r\nEnglish had not been so blinded to the real seriousness of the crisis that\r\nthey sent small forces and inefficient commanders. England was at peace\r\nwith all the world, and might naturally expect to prevent the active\r\nassistance of the colonies by any other power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two armies.]\r\n[Sidenote: Hessians.]\r\n[Sidenote: Indians.]\r\n[Sidenote: Discipline.]\r\n\r\nWhen the armies are compared, the number and enthusiasm of the Americans\r\nby no means made up for the difference of population. On the average,\r\n33,000 men were under the American colors each year; but the army\r\nsometimes fell, as at the battle of Princeton, Jan. 2, 1777, to but 5,000.\r\nThe English had an average of 40,000 troops in the colonies, of whom from\r\n20,000 to 25,000 might have been utilized in a single military operation;\r\nand in the crisis of the general European war, about 1780, Great Britain\r\nplaced 314,000 troops under arms in different parts of the world. The\r\nefficiency of the American army was very much diminished by the fact that\r\ntwo kinds of troops were in service,--the Continentals, enlisted by\r\nCongress; and the militia, raised by each colony separately. Of these\r\nmilitia, New England, with one fourth of the population of the country,\r\nfurnished as many as the other colonies put together. The British were\r\nable to draw garrisons from other parts of the world, and to fill up gaps\r\nwith Germans hired like horses; yet, although sold by their sovereign at\r\nthe contract price of thirty-six dollars per head, and often abused in\r\nservice, these Hessians made good soldiers, and sometimes saved British\r\narmies in critical moments. Another sort of aliens were brought into the\r\ncontest, first by the Americans, later by the English. These were the\r\nIndians. They were intractable in the service of both sides, and\r\ndetermined no important contest; but since the British were the invaders,\r\ntheir use of the Indians combined with that of the Hessians to exasperate\r\nthe Americans, although they had the same kind of savage allies, and\r\neventually called in foreigners also. In discipline the Americans were far\r\ninferior to the English. General Montgomery wrote: \"The privates are all\r\ngenerals, but not soldiers;\" and Baron Steuben wrote to a Prussian officer\r\na little later: \"You say to your soldier, 'Do this,' and he doeth it; but\r\nI am obliged to say to mine, 'This is the reason why you ought to do\r\nthat,' and then he does it.\" The British officers were often incapable,\r\nbut they had a military training, and were accustomed to require and to\r\nobserve discipline. The American officers came in most cases from civil\r\nlife, had no social superiority over their men, and were so unruly that\r\nJohn Adams wrote in 1777: \"They quarrel like cats and dogs. They worry one\r\nanother like mastiffs, scrambling for rank and pay like apes for nuts.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commanders.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Revolution was, nevertheless, due to the personal\r\nqualities of these officers and their troops, when directed by able\r\ncommanders. In the early stages of the war the British generals were slow,\r\ntimid, unready, and inefficient. Putnam, Wayne, Greene, and other American\r\ngenerals were natural soldiers; and in Washington we have the one man who\r\nnever made a serious blunder, who was never frightened, who never\r\ndespaired, and whose unflinching confidence was the rallying point of the\r\nmilitary forces of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plans of campaign.]\r\n\r\nThe theatre of the war was more favorable to the British than to the\r\nAmericans. There were no fortresses, and the coast was everywhere open to\r\nthe landing of expeditions. The simplest military principle demanded the\r\nisolation of New England, the source and centre of the Revolution, from\r\nthe rest of the colonies. From 1776 the British occupied the town of New\r\nYork, and they held Canada. A combined military operation from both South\r\nand North would give them the valley of the Hudson. The failure of\r\nBurgoyne's expedition in 1777 prevented the success of this manoeuvre. The\r\nwar was then transferred to the Southern colonies, with the intention to\r\nroll up the line of defence, as the French line had been rolled up in\r\n1758; but whenever the British attempted to penetrate far into the country\r\nfrom the sea-coast, they were eventually worsted and driven back.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (1775).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conception of a \"Congress.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore the war could be fought, some kind of civil organization had to be\r\nformed. On May 10, 1775, three weeks after the battle of Lexington, the\r\nsecond Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia, and continued, with\r\noccasional adjournments, till May 1, 1781. To the minds of the men of that\r\nday a congress was not a legislature, but a diplomatic assembly, a meeting\r\nof delegates for conference, and for suggestions to their principals. To\r\nbe sure, this Congress represented the people, acting through popular\r\nconventions, and not the old colonial assemblies; yet those conventions\r\nassumed to exercise the powers of government in the colonies, and expected\r\nthe delegates to report back to them, and to ask for instructions.\r\nNevertheless, the delegates at once began to pass resolutions which were\r\nto have effect without any ratification by the legislatures. Of the nine\r\ncolonies which gave formal instructions to their representatives, all but\r\none directed them to \"order\" something, or to \"determine\" something, or to\r\npass \"binding\" Acts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advisory action.]\r\n\r\nThus Congress began rather as the adviser than as the director of the\r\ncolonies; but it advised strong measures. On May 30, 1775, a plan of\r\nconciliation suggested by Lord North was pronounced \"unreasonable and\r\ninsidious.\" On the request of the provincial congress of Massachusetts\r\nBay, it recommended that body to \"form a temporary colonial government\r\nuntil a governor of his Majesty's appointment will consent to govern the\r\ncolony according to its charter.\" June 12, Congress issued a proclamation\r\nrecommending \"a day of public humiliation, fasting, and prayer.\" Like the\r\nFirst Continental Congress, it framed several petitions and addresses to\r\nthe British people and to the king of Great Britain. During the first six\r\nweeks of its existence, therefore, the Second Continental Congress acted\r\nchiefly as the centre for common consultation, and as the agent for joint\r\nexpostulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FORMED (1775).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War in Massachusetts.]\r\n[Sidenote: National military measures.]\r\n\r\nThe situation rapidly passed beyond the stage of advice. The people of\r\nMassachusetts and the neighboring colonies, on their own motion, had shut\r\nup the governor of the colony and his troops in the town of Boston, and\r\nwere formally besieging him. On June 17 the British made their last\r\nsortie, and attacked and defeated the besieging forces at Bunker Hill.\r\nNeither the country nor Congress could long stand still. Precisely a week\r\nafter assembling, Congress voted that certain commerce \"must immediately\r\ncease.\" A week later, May 26, they \"Resolved, unanimously, that the\r\nmilitia of New York be armed and trained ... to prevent any attempt that\r\nmay be made to gain possession of the town;\" and on June 14 the momentous\r\nresolution was reached that \"an American continental army should be\r\nraised.\" On the following day George Washington, Esq., of Virginia, \"was\r\nunanimously selected to command all the continental forces raised or to be\r\nraised for the defence of American liberty.\" In October the fitting out of\r\na little navy and the commissioning of privateers were authorized.\r\n\r\nThese acts were acts of war such as up to this time had been undertaken\r\nonly by individual colonies or by the home government. They were, further,\r\nacts of united resistance, and in form they pledged the whole country to\r\nthe establishment of a military force, and the maintenance of hostilities\r\nuntil some accommodation could be reached.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National diplomacy.]\r\n[Sidenote: Other national powers.]\r\n\r\nIn other directions the Continental Congress showed similar energy.\r\nNovember 29, 1775, \"a Committee of Correspondence with our friends abroad\"\r\nwas ordered, and thus began, the foreign relations of the United States of\r\nAmerica. National ambassadors were eventually sent out; no colony presumed\r\nto send its own representative across the sea; foreign affairs from this\r\ntime on were considered solely a matter for the Continental Congress. In\r\nlike manner, Congress quietly took up most of the other matters which had\r\nbeen acknowledged up to this time to belong to the home government.\r\nCongress assumed the control of the frontier Indians, till this time the\r\nwards of England. The post-national office had been directed by English\r\nauthority; Congress took it over. The boundaries and other relations of\r\nthe colonies had been strictly regulated by the home government; Congress\r\nundertook to mediate in boundary disputes. Parliament had controlled\r\ntrade; Congress threw open American ports to all foreign nations, and\r\nprohibited the slave-trade. In financial matters Congress went far beyond\r\nany powers ever exercised by England. June 22 it ordered an issue of two\r\nmillion dollars in continental paper currency, and subscriptions to\r\nnational loans were opened both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Basis of national authority.]\r\n\r\nThis assumption of powers is the more remarkable since their exercise by\r\nEngland had caused the Revolution. The right to raise money by national\r\nauthority, the right to maintain troops without the consent of the\r\ncolonies, and the right to enforce regulations on trade,--these were the\r\nthree disputed points in the English policy of control. They were all\r\nexercised by the Continental Congress, and accepted by the colonies. In a\r\nword, the Continental Congress constituted a government exercising great\r\nsovereign powers. It began with no such authority; it never received such\r\nauthority until 1781. The war must be fought, the forces of the people\r\nmust be organized; there was no other source of united power and\r\nauthority; without formally agreeing to its supremacy, the colonies and\r\nthe people at large acquiesced, and accepted it as a government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organization of the government.]\r\n\r\nFor the carrying out of great purposes Congress was singularly\r\ninefficient. The whole national government was composed of a shifting body\r\nof representatives elected from time to time by the colonial or State\r\nlegislatures. It early adopted the system of forming executive committees\r\nout of its own number: of these the most important was the Board of War,\r\nof which John Adams was the most active member. Later on, it appointed\r\nexecutive boards, of which some or all the members were not in Congress:\r\nthe most notable example was the Treasury Office of Accounts. Difficult\r\nquestions of prize and maritime law arose; and Congress established a\r\ncourt, which was only a committee of its own members. In all cases the\r\ncommittees, boards, or officials were created, and could be removed, by\r\nCongress. The final authority on all questions of national government in\r\nall its forms was simply a majority of colonies or States in the\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. INDEPENDENCE DECLARED (1776).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency towards independence.]\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Congress and the command of General Washington the\r\nsiege of Boston was successfully pushed forward during the winter of 1775-\r\n76. From the beginning of the struggle to this time two political currents\r\nhad been running side by side,--the one towards a union of the colonies,\r\nthe other towards independence. Of these the current of union had run a\r\nlittle faster. Notwithstanding the authority which they had set over\r\nthemselves, the colonies still professed to be loyal members of the\r\nBritish empire. To be sure, there is a strong smack of insincerity in the\r\nprotestations poured forth by the assemblies and the second Continental\r\nCongress. But John Adams says: \"That there existed a general desire of\r\nindependence of the Crown in any part of America before the Revolution, is\r\nas far from the truth as the zenith is from the nadir.\" Yet Patrick Henry\r\ndeclared as early as September, 1774. that \"Government is dissolved.\r\nFleets and armies and the present state of things show that government is\r\ndissolved. We are in a state of nature, sir.... All America is thrown into\r\none mass.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hesitation.]\r\n[Sidenote: Suggestion of independence.]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that the Second Continental Congress had ordered the\r\ncolonies to be put in a state of defence, either independence must come,\r\nor thee colonies must submit. No far-seeing man could expect that England\r\nwould make the concessions which the colonies declared indispensable. Yet\r\nfor more than a year Congress hesitated to declare publicly that the\r\nAmericans would not return to obedience. As forgiving and loyal subjects\r\nof a king misled by wicked advisers, they still seemed supported by\r\nprecedent and acting on the rights of Englishmen. Suggestions were made\r\nthroughout 1775 looking towards independence Thus the New Hampshire\r\nRevolutionary Convention declared that \"the voice of God and of nature\r\ndemand of the colonies to look to their own political affairs.\" In May,\r\n1775, came the resolutions of a committee of Mecklenburg County, North\r\nCarolina. In declaring that the government of the colonies had ceased to\r\nexist, they were probably not different in spirit from many other\r\nresolutions passed by like bodies. On July 8, 1775, Congress sent its last\r\nformal petition to the Crown. In it \"Your Majesty's faithful subjects\" set\r\nforth \"the impossibility of reconciling the usual appearance of respect\r\nwith a just Attention to our own preservation against those artful and\r\ncruel Enemies who abuse your royal Confidence and Authority for the\r\nPurpose of effecting our destruction.\" Congress was determined to wait\r\nuntil the petition had been received. On the day when it was to have been\r\nhanded to the king, appeared a royal proclamation announcing that open and\r\narmed rebellion was going on in America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress determined.]\r\n\r\nThe news of the fate of the petition reached Philadelphia on October 31.\r\nThe hesitation of Congress was at an end. Three days later it resolved to\r\nrecommend the people of New Hampshire to establish their own government.\r\nThe next day similar advice was given to South Carolina, with the promise\r\nof continental troops to defend the colony. Here for the first time was an\r\nofficial recognition of the fact that the colonies stood no longer under\r\nEnglish control. It was an assertion that independence existed, and the\r\nsteps towards a formal declaration were rapid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence decided on.]\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of Independence.]\r\n[Sidenote: Rights of man.]\r\n\r\nIn this as in other similar crises Congress waited to find out the wish of\r\nthe colonial legislatures. By May 15, 1776, the opinion of so many\r\ncolonies had been received in favor of a declaration of independence that\r\nCongress voted, \"That it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of\r\nauthority under the Crown of Great Britain should be totally suppressed.\"\r\nCongress was now committed; and during the next few weeks the form of the\r\ndeclaration was the important question for discussion. Throughout the\r\ncountry, resolutions in favor of independence were passed by legislatures,\r\nconventions, and public meetings. On July 4, 1776, Congress adopted a\r\nsolemn Declaration of Independence. Like the statement of grievances of\r\n1765 and the declaration of 1774, this great state paper, drawn by the\r\nnervous pen of Thomas Jefferson, set forth the causes of ill-feeling\r\ntoward Great Britain. First comes a statement of certain self-evident\r\ntruths, a reiteration of those rights of man upon which Otis had dwelt in\r\nhis speech of 1761. Then follows an enumeration of grievances put forward\r\nin this crisis as their justification in the face of the world; yet of the\r\ntwenty-nine specifications of oppressive acts, not more than five were\r\nmanifestly illegal according to the prevailing system of English law. So\r\nfar as the Declaration of Independence shows, liberality and concession on\r\nthe part of England might even then have caused the Revolution to halt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assertion of independence.]\r\n\r\nAnother part of the Declaration is a statement that \"These United Colonies\r\nare free and independent states, dissolved from all allegiance to Great\r\nBritain, and have the powers of sovereign states.\" In form and spirit this\r\nclause does not create independent states, but declares that they are\r\nalready independent. Independence in no wise changed the status or\r\ncharacter of the Continental Congress: it continued to direct military\r\noperations and foreign negotiations, to deal with the Indians, and to\r\nregulate national finances. The immediate effect of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was that it obliged every American to take sides for or\r\nagainst the Revolution. No one could any longer entertain the delusion\r\nthat he could remain loyal to Great Britain while making war upon her. It\r\nwas, therefore, a great encouragement to the patriots, who speedily\r\nsucceeded, in most colonies, in driving out or silencing the loyalists.\r\nThere is a tradition that another member of Congress said to Franklin at\r\nthis time, \"We must all hang together.\" \"Yes,\" replied Franklin, \"we must\r\nall hang together, or we shall all hang separately.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n39. NEW STATE GOVERNMENTS FORMED (1775-1777).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is the Union older than the States?]\r\n[Sidenote: Revolutionary governments.]\r\n\r\nA practical result of the Declaration of Independence was that from that\r\nday each colony assumed the name of State; and the union changed its name\r\nof \"The United Colonies\" to the proud title of \"The United States of\r\nAmerica.\" Were the new States essentially different from the colonies?\r\nThis is one of the insoluble questions connected with the formation of the\r\nUnion. Calhoun later declared that the Declaration of Independence changed\r\nthe colonies from provinces subject to Great Britain to States subject to\r\nnobody. Lincoln in his message of July 4, 1861, said that \"The Union gave\r\neach of them whatever of independence and liberty it has. The Union is\r\nolder than any of the States, and in fact it created them as States.\" That\r\nthe States did not regard independence as freeing them from their relation\r\nto Congress may be seen from the fact that their new governments were\r\nformed under the direction or with the permission of Congress. The\r\noutbreak of the Revolution in 1775 had suddenly destroyed the\r\nconstitutional governments with which the colonies were familiar.\r\nEverywhere courts were prevented from sitting, and governors were impeded\r\nor driven out. In order to organize resistance and also to carry out the\r\nordinary purposes of government, in each colony there arose a\r\nrevolutionary and unauthorized body, known as the Provincial Convention,\r\nor Provincial Congress, which took upon itself all the powers of\r\ngovernment. The new arrangement was unsatisfactory to a people accustomed\r\nto orderly government and to stable administrations. They turned to\r\nCongress for advice. At first Congress suggested only temporary\r\narrangements. In November, 1775, it encouraged the colonies to form\r\npermanent organizations, and on May 10, 1776, it advised them all to\r\n\"adopt such governments as shall ... best conduce to the happiness and\r\nsafety of their constituents in particular, and America in general.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State constitutions.]\r\n\r\nActing under these suggestions, the colonies had already begun before July\r\n4, 1776, to draw up written instruments of government. In two States,\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island, the old charters were so democratic that\r\nwith a few slight changes of phraseology they were sufficient for the new\r\nconditions. In all other colonies the opportunity was taken to alter the\r\nfamiliar machinery. The Provincial Conventions, or, in one case, a special\r\nConstitutional Convention, drew up a constitution and put it into force.\r\nSince the governor had been unpopular, in several cases his place was\r\nsupplied by an executive council. The courts were reorganized on the old\r\nbasis, and the judges were left appointive. The first constitution to be\r\nformed was that of New Hampshire. January 5, 1776, the Provincial Congress\r\nvoted \"to take up civil government as follows.\" By 1777, nine other new\r\nconstitutions had thus been provided. They mark an epoch in the\r\nconstitutional history of the world. The great English charters and the\r\nAct of Settlement were constitutional documents; but they covered only a\r\nsmall part of the field of government. Almost for the first time in\r\nhistory, representatives of the people were assembled to draw up\r\nsystematic and complete constitutions, based on the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution of Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, the last State to form a definite constitution was\r\nMassachusetts. Till 1776, that colony claimed to be acting under a charter\r\nwhich England was ignoring. The General Court then chose councillors of\r\nits own to act as an executive. Dissensions broke out, and a considerable\r\nbody of the people of Berkshire County repudiated this government and\r\ndemanded a new constitution. In 1780 a constitution was drafted by a\r\nconvention assembled solely for that purpose, and, for the first time in\r\nthe history of America, the work of a convention was submitted for\r\nratification by a popular vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n40. THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE WAR (1775-1778).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British military policy.]\r\n\r\nTwo policies presented themselves to the British government at the\r\nbeginning of the war. They might have used their great naval strength\r\nalone, blockading the coast and sealing every harbor; thus the colonies\r\nwould be cut off from the rest of the world, and allowed to enjoy their\r\nindependence until they were ready to return to their allegiance. The\r\nalternative of invasion was chosen; but it was useless, with the forces\r\navailable, to occupy any considerable part of the interior. By threatening\r\nvarious parts of the coast, the Americans could be obliged to make many\r\ndetachments of their few troops. By occupying the principal towns, such as\r\nNewport, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Savannah, the centres of\r\nresistance could be broken up, the loyalists encouraged, and bases\r\nestablished, from which the main American armies were to be reached and\r\ndestroyed. On the sea the navy was to be used to ruin American commerce\r\nand to prevent the importation of supplies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American military policy.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Americans was, not to attempt to defend the whole coast,\r\nbut to keep as large a number of troops as they could raise together in\r\none body, as a substantial army; to defend their land communication from\r\nNew England to the South; and by standing ready for operations in the\r\nfield, to prevent the British from making any large detachments. They must\r\nhold as much of their territory as possible, in order to prevent\r\ndefections; and they must take every advantage of their defensive\r\nposition, in order at length to hem in and capture the opposing armies on\r\nthe coast, as they did finally at Yorktown. The open gate through the\r\nHudson they strove to close early in the war by invasion of Canada. On the\r\nsea all they could do was to capture supplies and destroy commerce, and by\r\nthe ravages of their privateers to inspire the enemy with respect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plans frustrated.]\r\n\r\nNeither party was able to carry out its plans. The British took all the\r\nprincipal seaports, but were able to hold none, except New York, to the\r\nend of the war. First Burgoyne and later Cornwallis made a determined\r\nattempt to penetrate far into the interior, and both were captured. On the\r\nother hand, the Americans could not shake off the main central army, and\r\nthere was danger to the very last that the British would beat them in one\r\npitched battle which would decide the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1776.]\r\n[Sidenote: Princeton and Trenton.]\r\n\r\nMilitary operations began with several surprises to the advantage of the\r\ncolonists. They took Ticonderoga and invested Boston before the British\r\ngovernment believed that a fight was impending. An expedition to Canada\r\nfailed in 1775-76, but Boston fell. Down to the day of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence the advantage was clearly with the colonists. The hard, stern\r\nstruggle of the war began in August, 1776, with the arrival of the British\r\nin the harbor of New York. The Americans were attacked on Long Island, and\r\nobliged to retreat across the river; when the militia were attacked on\r\nthat side Washington says: \"They ran away in the greatest confusion,\r\nwithout firing a shot.\" Eye-witnesses relate that \"His Excellency was left\r\non the ground within eighty yards of the enemy, so vexed with the infamous\r\nconduct of the troops that he sought death rather than life.\" The American\r\narmy with difficulty escaped northward, and Washington was obliged to\r\nabandon the important line of the Hudson, and to retreat before the\r\nBritish towards Philadelphia. The campaign of 1776 had gone against the\r\nAmericans. Suddenly out of the gloom and despair came two brilliant little\r\nvictories. Crossing the Delaware on Christmas night, 1776, Washington\r\nstruck and beat parts of the British forces at Trenton and Princeton. They\r\nretired, and the patriots held Philadelphia during the winter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1777.]\r\n[Sidenote: Steadfastness of the American army.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1777 Howe transferred his troops by sea to the\r\nChesapeake, beat the Americans, occupied Philadelphia, and lay in that\r\ncity till the next year. It was a dear success. While the main British\r\nforce was thus withdrawn from New York, an attempt was made to pierce the\r\ncolonies from the northward. Burgoyne slowly descended during the summer\r\nof 1777; but, unsupported by Howe, on October 17 he was obliged to\r\nsurrender his whole army at Saratoga. This victory roused the spirit and\r\ncourage of the new nation, and strengthened the hands of the envoys who\r\nwere begging for French alliance. It enabled Washington to maintain a\r\nsmall army in winter quarters at Valley Forge, twenty miles from\r\nPhiladelphia. Whatever the early faults of American troops and officers,\r\nthey had learned to obey and to suffer as soldiers, patriots, and heroes.\r\nAt one time barely five thousand men were fit for duty. \"Naked and\r\nstarving as they are.\" wrote Washington, \"we cannot sufficiently admire\r\nthe incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiers.\" With the first\r\ndays of the year 1778 came the darkest hour of the Revolution. The little\r\narmy, the indispensable hope, was beginning to thin out; the finances of\r\nthe country were desperate; nine hundred American vessels had been\r\ncaptured; an apathy had fallen upon the country. Yet light was beginning\r\nto dawn: Steuben, the German, had begun to introduce the discipline which\r\nwas to make the American army a new and powerful instrument; Lafayette had\r\nbrought the sympathy of France and his own substantial services; more than\r\nall, during these dark days the American envoys were concluding the treaty\r\nwith France which was to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. FOREIGN RELATIONS (1776-1780).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interest of France.]\r\n[Sidenote: English plan of reconciliation.]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the American struggle the French government had\r\nlooked on with interest and pleasure. The arrogance of England during the\r\nprevious war and during the negotiations of 1763 had excited a general\r\ndislike throughout Europe. When, in June, 1776, Silas Deane appeared at\r\nParis as the American envoy, he found, not recognition, but at least\r\nsympathy and assistance. Beaumarchais, a play-writer and adventurer, was\r\nmade an unofficial agent of France; and through him arms and supplies from\r\nroyal arsenals came into the hands of the Americans. More to the purpose,\r\nmoney was placed at the disposal of the envoys. In 1776 a million francs\r\nwere thus secured; in 1777 two millions. The arrival of Franklin in Paris\r\nin December, 1776, increased the American influence, and negotiations were\r\nentered upon for a treaty. The English cabinet, understanding the danger\r\nof a double war, made a last effort at reconciliation with the colonies.\r\nIn 1778 Lord North brought forward an act declaring that Parliament \"will\r\nnot impose any duty, taxes, or assessment whatever ... in North America or\r\nthe West Indies, except only such duties as it may be expedient to impose\r\nfor the regulation of commerce, the net produce of such duties to be\r\nalways paid and applied to and for the use of the colony in which the same\r\nshall be levied.\" The principle which had been so strenuously asserted by\r\nthe home government from 1765 to 1774 was now abandoned; it might\r\nreasonably be expected that the violent acts of Massachusetts directed\r\nagainst taxation would be forgiven. Commissioners were sent to America\r\nwith almost unlimited powers to remove the grievances of the colonies, and\r\nto restore peace and concord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alliance with France.]\r\n\r\nBefore they were appointed, a treaty of alliance had been made, Feb. 6,\r\n1778, between the United States and France. With it went a treaty of\r\ncommerce, insuring reciprocal trade with France. The colonies, which in\r\n1758 had been fiercely fighting the French as their hereditary enemies,\r\nwere now delighted at the prospect of their support. The peace commission\r\nremained in America from June to October; but though they offered every\r\nconcession short of absolute independence, the Americans remained firm,\r\nand entered with confidence on the campaign of 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n42. THE WAR ENDED (1778-1782).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stubbornness of George III.]\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1778.]\r\n\r\nThe European crisis was favorable to the Americans; the British government\r\nhad hitherto been unable to reduce them; the Germans would furnish no more\r\nmercenaries; a strong minority in Parliament opposed the American war;\r\nFrance had declared war in March, 1778, and Spain was about to follow.\r\nProper reinforcements could not be sent to America. The country cried out\r\nfor Pitt, who had declared himself positively against American\r\nindependence. The king resolutely refused. \"No advantage to this country,\r\nno personal danger to myself,\" said he, \"can ever make me address myself\r\nto Lord Chatham or to any other branch of the opposition.\" Pitt died on\r\nMay 11, and the chance of a statesmanlike policy disappeared. When the\r\nFrench fleet, with four thousand troops, appeared in American waters in\r\nJuly, 1778, Washington formed the hopeful plan of driving the British out\r\nof the country. Philadelphia had been abandoned by Clinton, acting under\r\norders of the British government. Only two places were left in the\r\npossession of the British,--New York city and Newport, Rhode Island. The\r\ncombined American and French expedition against Newport was a failure,\r\nalthough, as Washington said, \"it would have given the finishing blow to\r\nBritish pretensions of sovereignty over this country.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The war continued.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in England the king was imposing his relentless will upon a\r\nministry tired of the war, and upon the English people. It was the climax\r\nof George the Third's effort to escape from the principle of Parliamentary\r\nresponsibility. \"This country,\" he said, \"will never regain a proper tone\r\nunless ministers, as in the reign of King William, will not mind now and\r\nthen being in a minority.\" In April, 1779, Spain allied herself with\r\nFrance, and the combined fleets of those two powers obtained the mastery\r\nof the seas. Paul Jones, with a little fleet under an American commission,\r\ncaptured two British men-of-war, almost in sight of the English coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern campaign.]\r\n\r\nA new plan was formed for an American campaign in 1779. Forces were\r\ndirected against Georgia and South Carolina,--States in which there were\r\nmany loyalists. Savannah was taken, Charleston was assailed, and the\r\nexpedition under Cornwallis penetrated far into North Carolina. Yet at the\r\nend of 1780 the British held, besides New York, only the provinces of\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia. In September, 1780, Benedict Arnold all but\r\ndelivered to the hands of the enemy the important fortress of West Point.\r\nHe was weary of the struggle, and anxious to secure his own safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Yorktown.]\r\n\r\nWith renewed spirit the Americans in 1781 took the offensive in the\r\nCarolinas under Greene. Cornwallis moved northward to the peninsula of\r\nYorktown. The moment had come. By a rapid movement of Washington's army\r\nand the effective cooperation of the French fleet, Cornwallis was trapped\r\nat Yorktown; and on Oct. 19, 1781, he surrendered, with eight thousand\r\nmen. It was the first decided victory which Washington had himself gained.\r\nIt made evident to England the hopelessness of continuing the contest; and\r\nin November, 1782, peace was made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for American success.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary war was successful because the English underestimated\r\nthe strength of the movement at the beginning, because the English\r\ncommanders were incapable, and because in the later period, when the\r\nBritish were aroused, their strength was diverted by the dangerous\r\nEuropean war. It was gained finally by the firmness and resolution of the\r\npeople, and that resolution is typified in Washington. His patience and\r\nendurance, his ability to hold in check large forces with small armies\r\nimperfectly equipped, his power to keep the country up to the support of\r\nthe war, mark him as one of the world's great military commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION (1775-1783).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resources.]\r\n\r\nThe successful termination of the war is the more remarkable because it\r\nwas fought by a government almost without means, and finally without\r\ncredit. The saddest part of the suffering at Valley Forge is that it was\r\nunnecessary. There was always food and clothing in the country, but\r\nCongress had no money to buy it. Congress had no power to lay taxes, and\r\nthe colonies, most of which were spending large sums on their own militia,\r\nwere not disposed to supply the general treasury. The pay of the\r\nContinental troops and of the general officers, the furnishing of\r\nequipments and stores, the support of foreign embassies, were burdens that\r\nmust be borne, and Congress must find the means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental currency.]\r\n\r\nThe most successful and the most disastrous resource was the issue of\r\npaper-money. When, in June, 1775, it was proposed to meet the general\r\nexpenses by putting forth two millions in Continental notes, there was but\r\nfeeble objection. It was the only way of raising money which seemed to\r\ncost nobody anything. In the course of a year four millions more followed.\r\nCongress, with commendable foresight, called upon each colony to pay in a\r\nsum sufficient to retire its proportion of the issue. Nothing was paid,\r\nand the printing-press was again put in motion, until in January, 1779,\r\nfifty millions were issued at a time. In November, 1779, the limit of two\r\nhundred millions was reached. In order to float these notes the States\r\npassed acts making them a legal tender; but at the same time they were\r\nthemselves issuing large sums in a similar currency. Counterfeits\r\nabounded, but it soon became a matter of little difference whether a bill\r\nwas good or bad, since the best was worth so little. From the time of the\r\ncapture of New York by the British in 1776 the notes began to fall. In\r\n1778 the news of the French alliance caused a little rise; but in 1781 the\r\nbills fell to a point where a thousand dollars exchanged for one dollar in\r\nspecie, and a Philadelphia wag made out of the notes a blanket for his\r\ndog. The Continental currency was never redeemed, and was consequently a\r\nforced tax on those who were least able to pay, since every holder lost by\r\nits depreciation while in his hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loans.]\r\n\r\nThe absolutely necessary expenditures, without which no army could make\r\nhead against the British, were from twenty to twenty-five million specie\r\ndollars each year. Of this the Continental bills furnished on an average\r\nsome eight or ten millions. Another method of raising money was that of\r\nborrowing on funded loans. Great schemes were put forth. The United States\r\nwere to borrow at four per cent; they were to borrow two millions; they\r\nwere to borrow ten millions; they were to borrow twenty millions. The\r\nresult was that in three years $181,000 was thus loaned, and up to the end\r\nof the war but $1,600,000,--hardly a hundredth part of the necessary\r\nmeans. Failing to raise money directly, recourse was bad to the so-called\r\nloan-office certificates. These were issued to creditors of the\r\ngovernment, and bore interest. The greater part of the military supplies\r\nwere paid for in this extravagant and demoralizing fashion, and in 1789\r\nthey had to be settled, with accumulated interest amounting to nearly\r\nfifty per cent. Better success was had in Europe. No private banker would\r\nlend money to a set of rebels not recognized by any government as\r\nindependent, but the French and Spanish governments were willing to\r\nadvance both money and stores. In this way the United States received\r\nabout three million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Requisitions.]\r\n\r\nWhen it was evident that the domestic loan had failed, Congress called\r\nupon the States to furnish five millions of dollars, apportioned among\r\nthem according to their importance. These requisitions were repeated at\r\nintervals during the Revolution, but always with the same effect. Not a\r\nfourth part of the sums asked for was paid by the States. A system of\r\n\"specific supplies\" was adopted in 1778, by which the States were allowed\r\nto pay their quotas in kind. It added a new source of confusion, and\r\nbrought no more revenue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miscellaneous resources.]\r\n\r\nEvery device that the government could put into operation for raising\r\nmoney was eventually tried. A lottery brought considerable sums into the\r\ntreasury, the supplies for the army were seized at Valley Forge and\r\nelsewhere, and paid for in certificates. Bills were drawn on foreign\r\nministers for funds which it was hoped they might have in hand by the time\r\nthe bills reached them, and the government bought, and sent abroad to meet\r\nits indebtedness, cargoes of tobacco and other products.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speculation.]\r\n\r\nThe financial burdens of the government were increased by a spirit of\r\nextravagance, speculation, and even of corruption. Washington wrote,\r\n\"Unless extortion, forestalling, and other practices which have ... become\r\nexceedingly prevalent can meet with proper checks, we must inevitably sink\r\nunder such a load of accumulated oppressions.\" The whole cost of the war\r\nis estimated at one hundred and thirty-five millions. Of this about one\r\nhundred millions had been raised through the Continental bills and other\r\ndevices. About thirty-five millions remained as a national debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n44. INTERNAL DIFFICULTIES (1775-1782).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThat Congress was able to make no better provision for the finances was\r\ndue to a decline in its prestige rather than to a lack of interest in the\r\nwar. Some of the ablest members were drawn into military service, or sent\r\non foreign missions. The committee system made it inefficient, and it was\r\ndifficult to bring it to a decision upon the most important matters. In\r\nvain did Washington storm, and implore it to act quickly and intelligently\r\non military matters of great moment. Its relations with the States changed\r\nas the war advanced. Dec. 7, 1776;  Congress made Washington for a time\r\nalmost a dictator. In 1779 the Virginia legislature formally denied that\r\nit was \"answerable to Congress for not agreeing with any of its\r\nrecommendations.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The loyalists.]\r\n\r\nTo the frequent unfriendly relations with the States was added the\r\nconstant conflict with the loyalists. Throughout the colonies the\r\nadherents to England or the sympathizers with the English government were\r\nunder grave suspicion. Many of them left the country; some enlisted with\r\nthe British, and returned to fight against their own land. A body of\r\nloyalists led the hostile Indians into the Wyoming valley to torture and\r\nto murder. The loyalists who remained at home were often the medium of\r\ncommunication with the British lines. Some of them, like Dr. Mather Byles\r\nof Boston, and George Watson of Plymouth, were allowed to remain on\r\ncondition that they held their tongues. Washington was so exasperated with\r\nthem that he termed them \"execrable parricides.\" In every State the\r\nloyalists were feared and hated. When the British invaded the country, the\r\nloyalists joined them; when the British were repulsed, thousands of them\r\nwere obliged to abandon their homes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissensions in States.]\r\n\r\nThe finances of the States were as much disturbed as those of the Union.\r\nTheir paper-money issues shared the same fate. Their debts, funded and\r\nunfunded, increased. They were harassed by internal divisions, even among\r\nthe patriots. In Massachusetts, Berkshire County remained until 1780\r\npractically independent, and the county convention did not scruple to\r\ndeclare to the General Court that there were \"other States which will, we\r\ndoubt not, as bad as we are, gladly receive us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n45. FORMATION OF A CONSTITUTION (1776-1781).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminaries of a constitution.]\r\n[Sidenote: Articles submitted.]\r\n\r\nOne cause of the weakness of Congress and the disorders in the States was\r\nthe want of a settled national government. The Continental Congress\r\nunderstood that it was but a makeshift, and on the day when a committee\r\nwas formed to frame a Declaration of Independence, another committee was\r\nappointed to draw up Articles of Confederation. It reported July 12, 1776;\r\nbut the moment discussion began, it was seen that there were almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties. The first was the question whether each State\r\nshould have one vote, as in the existing government, or whether each\r\nshould cast a number of votes in proportion to its population; the second\r\nquestion was how revenue should be raised and assessed; the third was how\r\nthe western country should be held; the fourth was what powers should be\r\ngiven to the general government, and what retained by the States; the\r\nfifth, how disputes within the Union should be settled. When, on Nov. 15,\r\n1777, Congress had finally adopted a draft of Articles of Confederation,\r\nthe decline of its power and influence was reflected in the proposed\r\ninstrument of government. On the question of representation, the rule of\r\nvote by States was continued. The only taxation was a formal system of\r\nrequisitions on the States. Here the question of slavery was unexpectedly\r\nbrought in: the Northern States desired to apportion the taxes according\r\nto total population, including slaves. \"Our slaves are our property\" said\r\nLynch, of South Carolina; \"If that is debated, there is an end of the\r\nConfederation. Being our property, why should they be taxed more than\r\nsheep?\" A compromise was reached, by which requisitions were to be\r\nassessed in proportion to the value of lands in the several States. The\r\nquestion of control of territory was not distinctly settled by the\r\narticles. The powers to be conferred upon the Confederation were\r\npractically limited to war, peace, and foreign affairs. A cumbrous system\r\nof arbitration courts was established for disputes between States, but\r\nthere was no machinery for settling quarrels between States and the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Western lands.]\r\n[Sidenote: Maryland will not ratify.]\r\n[Sidenote: Articles in force.]\r\n\r\nCongress had spent a year and a half in forming the Articles of\r\nConfederation. The States took three and a half years in ratifying them.\r\nTen States early signified their willingness to adopt them. Three others\r\nstood out because the Western lands were left in dispute. In 1776 when the\r\nBritish authority had been declared no longer existent in the colonies,\r\neach of the new States considered itself possessed of all the British\r\nlands which at any time had been included within its boundary; and in 1778\r\nVirginia had captured the few British posts northwest of the Ohio, and had\r\nshortly after created that immense region, now the seat of five powerful\r\nStates, into the \"County of Illinois.\" On the other hand, it was strongly\r\nurged that the Western territory had been secured through a war undertaken\r\nby all the colonies for the whole country, and that the lands ought to be\r\nreserved to reward the continental soldiers, and to secure the debt of the\r\nUnited States. For the sake of union, two of the three dissatisfied\r\ncommonwealths agreed to the Articles of Confederation. One State alone\r\nstood firm: Maryland, whose boundaries could not be so construed as to\r\ninclude any part of the lands, refused to ratify unless the claims of\r\nVirginia were disallowed; Virginia and Connecticut proposed to close the\r\nUnion without Maryland; Virginia even opened a land office for the sale of\r\na part of the territory in dispute; but threats had no effect. New York,\r\nwhich had less to gain from the Western territory than the other\r\nclaimants, now came forward with the cession of her claims to the United\r\nStates; and Virginia, on Jan. 2, 1781, agreed to do the like. On March 1,\r\n1781, it was announced that Maryland had ratified the Articles of\r\nConfederation, and they were duly put into force. From that date the\r\nCongress, though little changed in personnel or in powers, was acting\r\nunder a written constitution, and the States had bound themselves to abide\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n\r\n46. PEACE NEGOTIATED (1779-1782).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instructions of 1779.]\r\n[Sidenote: Instructions of 1781.]\r\n\r\nThus the settlement of the final terms of peace fell to the new\r\ngovernment, but rather as a heritage than as a new task. Instructions\r\nissued by Congress in 1779 had insisted, as a first essential, on an\r\nacknowledgment by Great Britain of the independence of the United States.\r\nNext, adequate boundaries were to be provided; the United States must\r\nextend as far west as the Mississippi, as far south as the thirty-first\r\nparallel, and as far north as Lake Nipissing. The third desideratum was\r\nundisturbed fishery rights on the banks of Newfoundland. Finally, it was\r\nexpected that a treaty of commerce would be yielded by Great Britain after\r\nthe peace was made. In 1781 Virginia, alarmed by Cornwallis's invasion,\r\nsucceeded in carrying a very different set of instructions. The only\r\nessential was to be the substantial admission that America was\r\nindependent; in all else the treaty was to be made in a manner\r\nsatisfactory to the French minister of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king consents to peace.]\r\n[Sidenote: Independence.]\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary.]\r\n[Sidenote: Instructions ignored.]\r\n\r\nBefore peace could be reached it was necessary to break down the iron\r\nopposition of the king. On Feb. 28, 1781 Conway's motion, looking to the\r\ncessation of the war, was adopted by Parliament. \"The fatal day has come,\"\r\nsaid the king. It was not merely his American policy which had failed; the\r\nparty of the \"King's Friends\" was beaten; North resigned; and after twelve\r\nyears of strenuous opposition, the king was obliged to accept a Whig\r\nministry, which he detested, and to let it negotiate for peace. A part of\r\nthe ministry still cherished the delusion that the Americans would accept\r\nterms which did not leave them independent. The firmness of the American\r\nenvoys was effectual; a royal commission was at last addressed to Oswald,\r\nauthorizing him to treat with \"the commissioners of the United States of\r\nAmerica\" in Paris. Then came the important question of boundary. Without\r\nthe thirteen colonies the possession of the Floridas was of little value\r\nto England, and they had been reduced by a Spanish expedition in 1781;\r\nthey were therefore returned to Spain. For a long time the English\r\ninsisted that a neutral belt of Indian territory should be created west of\r\nthe mountains. That point was finally waived; the Americans withdrew their\r\npretensions to the territory north of Lake Erie; and the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver system, from the western end of Lake Superior to the forty-fifth\r\nparallel, was made the boundary. From the forty-fifth parallel to the sea,\r\nthe boundary was described as following the \"highlands which divide those\r\nrivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those which fall\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean.\" The country was little known; the commissioners\r\nwere probably confused; and the ground was thus prepared for a dispute\r\nwhich lasted fifty-nine years. In the course of the negotiations the\r\nAmerican ambassadors, Jay, Adams, Franklin, and Laurens, became suspicious\r\nof the French court. There is now some reason for believing that\r\nVergennes, the French minister, had dealt honorably with the American\r\ninterests, and could have secured excellent terms. \"Would you break your\r\ninstructions?\" asked one of the fellow-commissioners of Jay. \"I would,\" he\r\nreplied, \"as I would break this pipe.\" Thenceforward the Americans dealt\r\ndirectly and solely with the English envoys.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mississippi.]\r\n[Sidenote: The fisheries.]\r\n\r\nThe next question to be settled was the claim of the English to the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, which was supposed to reach northward into\r\nBritish territory. It was yielded; the Americans, however, received no\r\ncorresponding right of navigation through Spanish territory to the sea.\r\nNext came the fisheries. As colonists the New Englanders had always\r\nenjoyed the right to fish upon the Newfoundland banks, and to land at\r\nconvenient spots to cure their fish. Adams, representing New England,\r\ninsisted that \"the right of fishing\" should be distinctly stated; he\r\ncarried his point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loyalists.]\r\n[Sidenote: Debts.]\r\n[Sidenote: Slaves.]\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty signed.]\r\n\r\nThe main difficulties disposed of, three troublesome minor points had to\r\nbe adjusted. The first was the question of loyalists. They had suffered\r\nfrom their attachment to the British government; they had been exiled;\r\ntheir estates had been confiscated, their names made a by-word. The\r\nBritish government first insisted, and then pleaded, that the treaty\r\nshould protect these persons if they chose to return to their former\r\nhomes. The Americans would agree only that Congress should \"earnestly\r\nrecommend\" to the thirteen legislatures to pass Relief Acts. Then came the\r\nquestion of private debts due to the British merchants at the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolution, and still unpaid. Some of the American envoys objected to\r\nreviving these obligations; but Adams, when he arrived, set the matter at\r\nrest by declaring that he had \"no notion of cheating anybody.\" Finally\r\ncame the question of the treatment of the slaves who had taken refuge with\r\nthe British armies; and the English commissioners agreed that the British\r\ntroops should withdraw \"without causing any destruction or the carrying\r\naway any negroes or other property of the American inhabitants.\" On Nov.\r\n30, 1782, a provisional treaty was signed; but it was not until Sept. 3,\r\n1783 after the peace between France and England had been adjusted, that\r\nthe definitive treaty was signed, in precisely the same terms.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty a quorum was assembled, and on Jan. 14, 1784, it was\r\nduly ratified by Congress. The treaty was a triumph for American\r\ndiplomacy. \"It is impossible,\" says Lecky, the ablest historian of this\r\nperiod, \"not to be struck with the skill, hardihood, and good fortune that\r\nmarked the American negotiations. Everything the United States could with\r\nany show of plausibility demand from England, they obtained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n47. POLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American union.]\r\n\r\nThus in seven years America had advanced from the condition of a body of\r\nsubordinate colonies to that of a nation. Furthermore, the people, who at\r\nthe beginning of the struggle were scattered and separated, and who\r\nscarcely knew each other, were now united under a government; the\r\nConfederation, however weak, was the strongest federation then in\r\nexistence. The people had learned the lesson of acting together in a great\r\nnational crisis, and of accepting the limitations upon their governments\r\nmade necessary by the central power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union not perfected.]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the new nation was now to be subjected to a test more severe\r\nthan that of the Revolution. Danger banded the colonies together during\r\nthe war. Would they remain together during peace? Sectional jealousies had\r\nbroken out in Congress and in camp; and in the crisis of 1777 an effort\r\nhad been made to displace Washington. There had been repeated instances of\r\ntreachery among military officers and among foreign envoys. The States\r\nwere undoubtedly much nearer together than the colonies had been; they had\r\naccepted a degree of control from the general government which they had\r\nrefused from England; but they were not used to accept the resolutions of\r\nCongress as self-operative. Their conception of national government was\r\nstill that national legislation filtrated from Congress to the State\r\nlegislatures, and through that medium to the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frontier difficulties.]\r\n\r\nThe interior of the country was in a confused and alarming state. The\r\nterritorial settlement with the States had only begun, and was to be the\r\nwork of years. The Indians were a stumbling-block which must be removed\r\nfrom the path of the settlers. Within the States there were poverty,\r\ntaxation, and disorder, and a serious discontent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Common institutions.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the system of the colonies was a system of union. The State\r\ngovernments all rested on the same basis of revolution and defiance of\r\nformer established law; but when they separated from England they\r\npreserved those notions of English private and public law which had\r\ndistinguished the colonies. The laws and the governments of the States\r\nwere everywhere similar. The States were one in language, in religion, in\r\ntraditions, in the memories of a common struggle, and in political and\r\neconomic interests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade hampered.]\r\n\r\nCommercially, however, the situation of the country was worse than it had\r\nbeen in three quarters of a century. Though the fisheries had been saved\r\nby the efforts of Adams, the market for the surplus fish was taken away.\r\nAs colonies they had enjoyed the right to trade with other British\r\ncolonies; as an independent nation they had only those rights which\r\nEngland chose to give. For a time the ministry seemed disposed to make a\r\nfavorable commercial treaty; but in 1783 an Order in Council was issued\r\ncutting off the Americans from the West Indian trade; and it was not until\r\n1818 that they recovered it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Republican government encouraged.] A great political principle\r\nhad been strengthened by the success of the Revolution: republican\r\ngovernment had been revived in a fashion unknown since ancient times. The\r\nterritory claimed by Virginia was larger than the island of Great Britain.\r\nThe federal republic included an area nearly four times as large as that\r\nof France. In 1782 Frederick of Prussia told the English ambassador that\r\nthe United States could not endure, \"since a republican government had\r\nnever been known to exist for any length of time where the territory was\r\nnot limited and concentred.\" The problem was a new one; but in communities\r\nwithout a titled aristocracy, which had set themselves against the power\r\nof a monarch, and which had long been accustomed to self-government, the\r\nproblem was successfully worked out. The suffrage was still limited to the\r\nholders of land; but the spirit of the Revolution looked towards\r\nabolishing all legal distinctions between man and man; and the foundation\r\nof later democracy, with its universal suffrage, was thus already laid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of rights of man.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the republican spirit upon the rest of the world was not\r\nyet discerned; but the United States had established for themselves two\r\nprinciples which seriously affected other nations. If English colonies\r\ncould by revolution relieve themselves from the colonial system of\r\nEngland, the French and Spanish colonies might follow that example; and\r\nforty years later not one of the Spanish continental colonies acknowledged\r\nthe authority of the home government. The other principle was that of the\r\nrights of man. The Declaration of Independence contained a list of rights\r\nsuch as were familiar to the colonists of England, but were only theories\r\nelsewhere. The success of the Revolution was, therefore, a shock to the\r\nsystem of privilege and of class exemptions from the common burdens, which\r\nhad lasted since feudal times. The French Revolution of 1789 was an\r\nattempt to apply upon alien ground the principles of the American\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION (1781-1788)\r\n\r\n\r\n48.

THE UNITED STATES IN 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Army.]\r\n[Sidenote: Territory.]\r\n\r\nThe task thrown upon Congress in 1781 would have tried the strongest\r\ngovernment in existence. An army of more than ten thousand men was under\r\narms, and must be kept up until peace was formally declared, and then must\r\nbe paid off. The territorial claims of the States and of the Union were\r\nstill in confusion. Virginia roused the suspicion of the small States by\r\nmaking the promised cession in terms which Congress could not accept, and\r\nthe other States had made no motion towards yielding their claims.\r\nRelations with the Indians were still confused. Superintendents of Indian\r\naffairs had been appointed, and in 1778 a treaty was negotiated with the\r\nCreeks; but the States, particularly Pennsylvania and Georgia, continued\r\nto make their own arrangements with Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Finances.]\r\n[Sidenote: Commerce.]\r\n[Sidenote: General weakness.]\r\n\r\nThe finances of the country seemed to have reached their lowest ebb. An\r\nattempt was made to float a new issue of continental money at one dollar\r\nfor forty of the old bills The new obligations speedily sank to the level\r\nof the old, and the country was practically bankrupt. The aid of the\r\nFrench was all that kept the government afloat (§ 43). The return of peace\r\nwas expected to restore American commerce to its old prosperity; but\r\nhaving gone to war principally because colonial commerce with other\r\ncountries was restricted, the Americans found themselves deprived of their\r\nold freedom of trade with England. They were subject to discriminating\r\nduties in English ports, and were excluded from the direct trade with the\r\nEnglish West Indies, which had been the chief resource the colonial ship-\r\nowners. The State governments were in debt, embarrassed, and beset with\r\nthe social difficulties which come in the train of war. The disbanded\r\ntroops were not accustomed to regular employment or to a quiet life; taxes\r\nwere heavy and odious; the far Western settlements clamored to be set free\r\nfrom the States to which they belonged. Above all, the national government\r\nwas weak, inefficient, and little respected by the army or the people at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT (1781-1788.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe first and fundamental defect of the government was in the organization\r\nof Congress. The Continental Congress had been a head without a body;\r\nunder the Articles of Confederation, Congress was a body without a head. A\r\nsingle assembly continued to be the source of all national legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial power (§ 37). As though to prevent the country\r\nfrom getting the benefit of experience, no man could remain a member of\r\nCongress for more than three years in succession. The delegates of each\r\nState continued to cast jointly one vote; if only one member were present,\r\nthe vote of a State was not counted; if but two were present, they might\r\nproduce a tie. On important questions the approval of nine States was\r\nnecessary, and often less than that number had voting representatives on\r\nthe floor. Amendment was impossible, except by consent of all the State\r\nlegislatures. Although Congress had to deal with difficult questions of\r\npeace, its principal power was that of carrying on war. Congress might\r\nmake treaties, but it could pass no act in defence of American commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive departments.]\r\n\r\nA great effort was made to improve the executive system. By resolutions\r\npassed early in 1781, secretaries were appointed for the three departments\r\nof Foreign Affairs, War, and Finance; the board system, championed by\r\nSamuel Adams and others, was to be abandoned. The importance of the War\r\nDepartment diminished after 1782. \"The Secretary of the United States for\r\nthe Department of Foreign Affairs\" was quartered in two little rooms, and\r\nfurnished with two clerks. The post was filled first by Robert R.\r\nLivingston, and from 1784 by John Jay. The office of Superintendent of\r\nFinance was bestowed upon Robert Morris of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courts.]\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation provided for a special tribunal to settle\r\nterritorial disputes between the States. The system was invoked in 1782,\r\nand a verdict was rendered in favor of Pennsylvania and against\r\nConnecticut in their rival claims to the Wyoming region. A second set of\r\nfederal courts was constituted by designating certain State courts to try\r\npiracies and felonies committed on the high seas. A third and the only\r\nimportant federal tribunal was the Court of Appeals in prize cases, which\r\nbegan to sit in January, 1780, and before which were sued sixty-five\r\ncases.  All the courts, like all the executive departments, were created\r\nby Congress, alterable by Congress, and subject to the control of\r\nCongress. In 1784 the Court of Appeals was allowed to lapse, by the\r\nrefusal of Congress to pay the salaries of the judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. DISBANDMENT OF THE ARMY (1783.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow the history of the Confederation from year to year would be\r\nunprofitable. It was a confused period, with no recognized national\r\nleaders, no parties, no great crises. We shall therefore take up one after\r\nanother the important questions which arose, and follow each to the end of\r\nthe Confederation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Half-pay question.]\r\n[Sidenote: Protests.]\r\n\r\nThe first duty of Congress after peace was declared was to cut off the\r\nmilitary expenditures (§ 42). The food, clothing, and pay of the army\r\namounted to about $400,000 a month. Provision had been made for bounty\r\nlands for the soldiers; the officers expected some more definite reward.\r\nOn April 26, 1778, Congress, by a majority of one State, had voted half\r\npay for life to the officers, as an essential measure for keeping the army\r\ntogether. In the four years following, five different votes had been\r\npassed, each annulling the previous one. Another proposition, in November,\r\n1782, was to remit the whole matter to the States. On March 10, 1783,\r\nappeared the so-called \"Newburgh addresses,\"--an anonymous plea to the\r\narmy, urging the officers not to separate until Congress had done justice\r\nin this respect. A crisis was threatened. Washington himself attended the\r\nmeeting of the officers, and counselled moderation. He used his utmost\r\ninfluence with Congress, and on the 22d of March secured a vote of full\r\npay for five years. As the treasury was empty, the only payment to the\r\nofficers was in certificates of indebtedness, upon which interest\r\naccumulated during the next seven years. Massachusetts protested,\r\ndeclaring the grant to be \"more than an adequate reward for their\r\nservices, and inconsistent with that equality which ought to subsist among\r\ncitizens of free and republican states.\" In June, 1783, three hundred\r\nmutineers surrounded the place of meeting of Congress, and demanded a\r\nsettlement of their back pay; and the executive council of Pennsylvania\r\ndeclined to interfere. The result was that Congress changed its place of\r\nmeeting, and ever after retained a lively resentment against the city of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. TERRITORIAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE STATES (1781-1802).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Western claims.]\r\n[Sidenote: Northwest cessions.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Congress had no power, under the Articles of Confederation, to\r\nregulate territory, it earnestly urged the States to cede their claims.\r\nThe Ohio River divided the Western country into two regions, each having a\r\nseparate territorial history. The northern part was claimed by Virginia,\r\nMassachusetts, and Connecticut, on the ground that their old charters,\r\nextending to the Pacific, were revived (§ 45). The United States, as\r\nrepresenting the landless States, claimed the whole region as territory\r\nwon by the common effort and sacrifice of the Revolutionary War. On March\r\n1, 1784, Virginia ceded all her claims north of the Ohio River, except a\r\nreservation for bounty lands. Massachusetts followed in 1785; the\r\ncommonwealth had large tracts of unoccupied land in Maine and in New York.\r\nConnecticut had no such resources, and in 1786 ceded only the western part\r\nof her claim, retaining till 1800, as a \"Western Reserve,\" a strip,\r\nextending along Lake Erie, one hundred and twenty miles west from\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Territorial organization.]\r\n\r\nThe claims to the region north of the Ohio having thus been extinguished,\r\nthe government began to make plans for the administration of its domain.\r\nOn Oct. 10, 1780, the Continental Congress had promised that the lands\r\nceded by the States should be \"disposed of for the common benefit of the\r\nUnited States,\" and \"be settled and formed into distinct republican States\r\nwhich shall become members of the federal union.\" These two principles are\r\nthe foundation both of the territorial and the public land systems of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1784, an ordinance reported by Jefferson was passed,\r\nproviding for representative legislatures as fast as the West grew\r\nsufficiently populous to maintain them. It is hardly a misfortune that the\r\nmap was not encumbered with the names suggested by Jefferson for the new\r\nStates,--Cherronesus, Metropotamia, Assenisippia, Polypotamia, and\r\nPelisipia; but another clause was voted down which would have prohibited\r\nslavery in the Territories after 1800.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northwest Ordinance.]\r\n\r\nJune 13, 1787, a second ordinance passed Congress, which was inferior in\r\nimportance only to the Federal Constitution. It provided minutely for a\r\npreliminary territorial government, in which laws were to be made by\r\nappointive judges, and for a later representative government. The\r\nconception was that the Territories were to occupy the position formerly\r\nclaimed by the colonies; they were to be subject to no general taxation,\r\nbut placed under a governor appointed by the general government; their\r\nlaws were to be subject to his veto, and to later revision by the central\r\nauthority. A new principle was the preparation of the Territories for\r\nstatehood: the ordinance laid down a series of \"Articles of Compact\" to\r\ngovern them after they were admitted into the Union. Religious liberty and\r\npersonal rights were to be secured; general morality and education to be\r\nencouraged; and finally it was provided that \"there shall be neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude in the said Territory, otherwise than in\r\nthe punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly\r\nconvicted.\" The introduction of this clause is due to New England men, who\r\nwere anxious to form a colony on the Ohio, and who desired to secure the\r\nfreedom with which they were familiar. The clause had no effect upon\r\nslaves held in the Territory at the time of the passage of the ordinance,\r\nbut it distinctly expresses the dissatisfaction of the country with the\r\nsystem of human slavery. As soon as the Northwest Territory was organized,\r\nthe sale of lands began; but nothing was received in cash till long after\r\nthe Confederation had expired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern cessions.]\r\n\r\nIn the southern block of States the territorial settlement proceeded more\r\nslowly, and was in every way less satisfactory. Virginia retained both\r\njurisdiction and land in Kentucky. North Carolina in 1790 granted the\r\njurisdiction in what is now Tennessee, but every acre of the land had\r\nalready been granted by the State. South Carolina had almost nothing to\r\ncede, and yielded it in 1787. Georgia stood out on the claim to the whole\r\nterritory between her present boundary and the Mississippi, and would not\r\nyield until 1802. Slavery was not prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n53. FINANCES (1781-1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial status.]\r\n[Sidenote: Requisitions.]\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of the Confederation was throughout deplorable (§\r\n43). The Revolution imposed upon the country a heavy debt. The accounts of\r\nthe government were so badly kept that to this day it is impossible to\r\nstate the amount; but it was probably about thirty millions, with an\r\nannual interest charge of about two millions. The necessary expenditure\r\nfor the support of Congress, of the army on a peace-footing, and of the\r\nexecutive and judicial boards and departments, called for about half a\r\nmillion more. The continental currency had practically been repudiated,\r\nand no more could be floated; Congress had no power to lay either direct\r\nor indirect taxes; the post-office had an income of about $25,000 a year,\r\nall of which was expended upon the service. Hence Congress fell back on\r\nrequisitions apportioned on the States: one of its principal functions was\r\neach year to calculate the amount necessary for the public service, and to\r\ncall upon the State legislatures for their quota. The total sum required\r\nfrom 1781 to 1788 was about $16,000,000. Of this there had actually been\r\npaid during the seven years $3,500,000 in specie, and $2,500,000 in\r\ncertificates of national indebtedness. The annual cash income of the\r\ngovernment was therefore about half a million, which was entirely absorbed\r\nby the necessary running expenses of the government, leaving nothing for\r\nthe payment of interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morris's administration.]\r\n\r\nThis condition of virtual bankruptcy might have been avoided had Robert\r\nMorris been able to carry out the reforms which he proposed when he became\r\nsuperintendent of finance in 1781. He found the financial administration\r\ncomplicated and corrupt. He attempted to substitute business methods and\r\npunctuality of payment. While the war lasted, however, the only financial\r\nsystem possible was to squeeze every source of revenue, and to pay only\r\nwhat could not be avoided. When peace returned, the States would provide\r\nno better system. To keep up the credit of the government the first\r\nnecessity was the prompt payment of interest: the payment of interest\r\nrequired money; money must come from taxes, and the State declined to levy\r\nthe taxes. In 1784 Morris resigned in despair, and thenceforward a\r\nTreasury Board mismanaged the finances of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bank of North America.]\r\n\r\nMay 26, 1781, Congress had taken the important step of chartering the Bank\r\nof North America. The United States was to furnish part of the capital,\r\nand to make the bank its financial agent. Its notes were to be receivable\r\nin the duties and taxes of every State in the Union. Morris asked Jay to\r\nget specie from Spain to start the bank. \"I am determined,\" said he, \"that\r\nthe bank shall be well supported until it can support itself, and then it\r\nwill support us.\" Its connection with the government practically ceased\r\nafter the retirement of Morris in 1784, although it remained under a State\r\ncharter a prosperous and useful institution, and is still in existence, a\r\nsound and healthy bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The currency.]\r\n\r\nAnother financial measure was the attempt to correct the currency. After\r\nthe end of the war there was found in circulation an extraordinary mixture\r\nof gold and silver coins of all nations, especially the Spanish milled\r\ndollar, which had been accepted by the Continental Congress as the unit of\r\nits issues. All the currency was badly counterfeited, defaced, and\r\nclipped. In 1782 the quartermaster-general, Timothy Pickering, who was\r\nabout to pay out a part of the French subsidy in coin, wrote as follows:\r\n\"I must trouble you for the necessary apparatus for clipping. 'Tis a\r\nshameful business and an unreasonable hardship on a public officer.... A\r\npair of good shears, a couple of punches, and a leaden anvil of two or\r\nthree pounds weight. Will you inquire how the goldsmiths put in their\r\nplugs?\" The Confederation, upon Jefferson's report, July 6, 1785, adopted\r\nthe dollar as its unit, and provided for a decimal ratio; but a few tons\r\nof copper cents made up the only national currency put into circulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign loans.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of its existence the Confederation found itself on the\r\nbrink of a default of interest on debts due to foreign governments and\r\nbankers. France in 1783 made a final loan of six hundred thousand francs;\r\nand from 1783 to 1788 Dutch bankers were found who had sufficient\r\nconfidence in the government to advance it $1,600,000 on favorable terms.\r\nWith the proceeds of these loans the government was able to pay the\r\naccumulated interest on the foreign loans, and thus to keep its credit\r\nabove water in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n54. DISORDERS IN THE STATES (1781-1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State financial legislation.]\r\n\r\nThe finances of the States were little better than those of the Union. The\r\nStates controlled all the resources of the country; they could and did\r\nraise taxes, but they appropriated the proceeds to their own pressing\r\nnecessities; and the meagre sums paid to Congress represented a genuine\r\nsacrifice on the part of many States, particularly Pennsylvania and\r\nMassachusetts. Unfortunately the States exercised unlimited powers over\r\ntheir own currency and commercial relations. Times were hard, debts had\r\naccumulated, property had been destroyed by the war. State after State\r\npassed stay laws delaying the collection of debts; or \"tender laws\" were\r\nenacted, by which property at an appraised value was made a legal tender,\r\nCattle, merchandise, and unimproved real estate were the usual currency\r\nthus forced upon creditors. After peace was declared, a second era of\r\nState paper-money issues came on, and but four of the thirteen States\r\nescaped the craze.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of the States.]\r\n[Sidenote: Proposed new states.]\r\n[Sidenote: Insurrections.]\r\n\r\nThese remedies bore hard on the creditors in other States, created a\r\nfeeling of insecurity among business men, and gave no permanent relief.\r\nThe discontented, therefore, sought a remedy for themselves. The\r\nRevolutionary War had left behind it an eddy of lawlessness and disregard\r\nof human life. The support of the government was a heavy load upon the\r\npeople. The States were physically weak, and the State legislatures\r\nhabitually timid. In several States there were organized attempts to set\r\noff outlying portions as independent governments. Vermont had set the\r\nexample by withdrawing from New York in 1777, and throughout the\r\nConfederation remained without representation either in the New York\r\nlegislature or in Congress. In 1782 the western counties of Pennsylvania\r\nand Virginia threatened to break off and form a new State. From 1785 to\r\n1786 the so-called State of \"Franklin,\" within the territory of what is\r\nnow eastern Tennessee, had a constitution and legislature and governor,\r\nand carried on a mild border warfare with the government of North\r\nCarolina, to which its people owed allegiance. The people of Kentucky and\r\nof Maine held conventions looking toward separation. The year 1786 was\r\nmarked by great uneasiness in what had been supposed to be the steadiest\r\nStates in the union. In New Hampshire the opposition was directed against\r\nthe legislature; but General Sullivan, by his courage, succeeded in\r\nquelling the threatened insurrection without bloodshed. In Massachusetts\r\nin the fall of 1786 concerted violence prevented the courts from sitting;\r\nand an organized force of insurgents under Captain Shays threatened to\r\ndestroy the State government. As a speaker in the Massachusetts convention\r\nof 1788 said, \"People took up arms; and then if you went to speak to them\r\nyou had the musket of death presented to your breast. They would rob you\r\nof your property, threaten to burn your houses; obliged you to be on your\r\nguard night and day.... How terrible, how distressing was this!... Had any\r\none that was able to protect us come and set up his standard, we should\r\nall have flocked to it, even though it had been a monarch.\" The arsenal at\r\nSpringfield was attacked. The State forces were met in the open field by\r\narmed insurgents. Had they been successful, the Union was not worth one of\r\nits own repudiated notes. The Massachusetts authorities were barely able\r\nto restore order, and Congress went beyond its constitutional powers in an\r\neffort to assist.\r\n\r\n\r\n55. SLAVERY (1777-1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-slavery spirit.]\r\n[Sidenote: Emancipation acts.]\r\n[Sidenote: Southern sentiment.]\r\n\r\nOne evidence that the States were still sound and healthful was the\r\npassage of Emancipation acts. The Revolutionary principles of the rights\r\nof man, the consent of the governed, and political equality, had been\r\nmeant for white men; but it was hard to deny their logical application to\r\nthe blacks. New anti-slavery societies were formed, particularly in\r\nPennsylvania; but the first community to act was Vermont. In the\r\nDeclaration of Rights prefixed to the Constitution of 1777 it was declared\r\nthat since every man is entitled to life, liberty, and happiness,\r\ntherefore \"no ... person born in this country, or brought here over sea,\r\nought to be holden by law to serve any person as a servant, slave, or\r\napprentice\" after he arrives at the age of maturity. A few years later\r\nthis was supplemented by an act abolishing the institution of slavery\r\noutright. The number of slaves in Vermont was inconsiderable, but in 1780\r\ntwo States, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, took similar action, affecting\r\nseveral thousand persons. The Massachusetts constitution of 1780 declared\r\nthat \"all men are born free and equal.\" This clause was a few years later\r\ninterpreted by the courts to mean that after 1780 no person could legally\r\nbe held as a slave. In Pennsylvania in the same year a gradual\r\nEmancipation Act was passed, under which persons then in bondage were to\r\nserve as slaves during their lives; their children, born after 1780, were\r\neventually to become free; and no person was to be brought into the State\r\nand sold as a slave. Within four years New Hampshire and Connecticut\r\npassed similar Emancipation Acts. In Rhode Island the number of slaves,\r\n3,500, was considerable in proportion to the population, and that State\r\ntherefore made a distinct sacrifice for its principles by its act of 1785.\r\nThus at the expiration of the Confederation in 1788, all the States north\r\nof Maryland, except New York and New Jersey, had put slavery in process of\r\nextinction; those two States followed in 1799 and 1804. Many Southern\r\nstatesmen hoped that the institution was dying out even in the South.\r\nJefferson in 1787 wrote: \"Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect\r\nthat God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" Some steps\r\nwere taken, particularly in Virginia and Kentucky, for the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of the blacks; and the slave-trade was forbidden in most of\r\nthe States of the Union during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n56. FOREIGN RELATIONS AND COMMERCE (1781-1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with England.]\r\n\r\nIn no respect, not even in finance, was the weakness of the Confederation\r\nso evident as in the powerlessness of Congress to pass commercial laws,\r\nand its consequent inability to secure commercial treaties. In 1785 John\r\nAdams was sent as minister to Great Britain, and was received with\r\ncivility by the sovereign from whom he had done so much to tear the\r\nbrightest jewel of his crown; but when he endeavored to come to some\r\ncommercial arrangement, he could make no progress. It is easy now to see\r\nthat the best policy for Great Britain would have been in every way to\r\nencourage American commerce; the Americans were accustomed to trade with\r\nEngland; their credits and business connections were established with\r\nEnglish merchants; the English manufactured the goods most desired by\r\nAmerica. When the Whigs were driven out of power in 1783, the last\r\nopportunity for such an agreement was lost. July 2, 1783, an Order in\r\nCouncil was issued, restraining the West India trade to British ships,\r\nBritish built; and on March 26, 1785, the Duke of Dorset replied to the\r\nAmerican commissioners who asked for a treaty: \"The apparent determination\r\nof the respective States to regulate their own separate interests renders\r\nit absolutely necessary, towards forming a permanent system of commerce,\r\nthat my court should be informed how far the commissioners can be duly\r\nauthorized to enter into any engagement with Great Britain which it may\r\nnot be in the power of any one of the States to render totally useless and\r\ninefficient.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loyalists.]\r\n[Sidenote: British debts.]\r\n[Sidenote: Posts.]\r\n\r\nThere were other reasons why the British continued to subject American\r\nships in English ports to discriminations and duties from which the\r\nvessels of most other powers were exempt. The treaty of 1783 had provided\r\nthat Congress would recommend to the States just treatment of the\r\nloyalists; the recommendation was made. Most of the States declined to\r\ncomply; men who had been eminent before the Revolution returned to find\r\nthemselves distrusted, and sometimes were mobbed; their estates, which in\r\nmost cases had been confiscated, were withheld, and they could obtain no\r\nconsideration. This was unfriendly, but not a violation of any promise.\r\nThe action of the States in placing obstacles in the way of collecting\r\ndebts due to British merchants before the Revolution was a vexatious\r\ninfraction of the treaty. Five States had passed laws for the partial or\r\ncomplete confiscation of such debts, and even after the treaty\r\nPennsylvania and Massachusetts passed similar Acts. As an offset, the\r\nBritish minister in 1786 declared that the frontier posts would not be\r\nsurrendered so long as the obstacles to the collection of British debts\r\nwere left standing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish treaty.]\r\n\r\nThe only other power with which the United States desired commercial\r\nrelations without possessing them was Spain. The Eastern States were very\r\nanxious to obtain privileges of trade. The Spanish were willing to grant\r\nthem, but made it a condition that the Americans should not have the right\r\nof free navigation of the lower Mississippi. Jay, acting under the\r\ninstruction of Congress, in 1786 negotiated a treaty in which he agreed to\r\nthe Spanish conditions. Instantly the West was aroused, and violent\r\nthreats were made by the people of Kentucky and the adjacent region that\r\nif that treaty went into effect they would withdraw from the Union. \"The\r\ntendency of the States,\" said Madison, a few months later, \"to violations\r\nof the laws of nations and treaties ... has been manifest.... The files of\r\nCongress contain complaints already from almost every nation with which\r\ntreaties have been formed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n57. DISINTEGRATION OF THE UNION (1786, 1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Confederation violated.]\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of anarchy.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1786 marks a crisis in the development of the Union. The\r\ninefficiency of Congress was reflected in the neglect of constitutional\r\nduties by the States: Rhode Island recalled her delegates, and refused to\r\nappoint new members; New Jersey felt so much injured by a New York tariff\r\nthat an act was passed taxing the lighthouse established by New York on\r\nSandy Hook; Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia\r\nalready had raised troops on their own account and for their own purposes,\r\nin violation of the Articles of Confederation. Davie, of North Carolina, a\r\nlittle later declared that the \"encroachments of some States on the rights\r\nof others, and of all on those of the Confederation, are incontestable\r\nproofs of the weakness and imperfections of that system.\" Of the\r\nrequisition of that year for $2,000,000 in specie, only about $400,000 was\r\npaid. Some States offered their own depreciated notes, and New Jersey\r\nrefused to make any contribution until the offensive New York Acts were\r\nwithdrawn. In May, 1786, Charles Pinckney on the floor of Congress\r\ndeclared that \"Congress must be invested with more powers, or the federal\r\ngovernment must fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n58. REORGANIZATION ATTEMPTED (1781-1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Five percent scheme.]\r\n[Sidenote: Revenue scheme.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Articles of Confederation had gone into effect, Congress had\r\nalready proposed a radical amendment; and within three years it suggested\r\ntwo others. The first proposition, made February 3, 1781, was that the\r\nStates allow Congress to levy an import duty of five per cent, the\r\nproceeds to be applied \"to the discharge of the principal and interest of\r\nthe debts already contracted ... on the faith of the United States for\r\nsupporting the present war.\" In the course of about a year twelve States\r\nhad complied with this reasonable request. Rhode Island alone stood out,\r\nand the plan failed. Forthwith Congress presented another financial\r\nscheme, which was called a \"general revenue plan.\" April 12, 1783, it\r\nasked the States to allow Congress to lay low specific import duties for\r\ntwenty-five years, to be collected by officers appointed by the States.\r\nThe States were further recommended to lay some effective taxes, the\r\nproceeds to be set aside for government requisitions. The effect was\r\nprecisely the same as before. Twelve States agreed; but the opposition of\r\nNew York prevented the first part of the plan from being carried out. Not\r\na single State had condescended to pay attention to the second request.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commerce amendment.]\r\n\r\nApparently abandoning any hope of an adequate revenue, Congress, on April\r\n30, 1784, proposed a third amendment, that the States should permit it to\r\npass commercial laws discriminating against foreign powers which refused\r\nto make commercial treaties. This was aimed at Great Britain. Washington\r\nurged the measure in vigorous language. \"We are,\" said he, \"either a\r\nunited people, or we are not so. If the former, let us in all matters of\r\nnational concern act as a nation which has a national character to\r\nsupport.\" Yet he could not bring even Virginia to agree to the plan, and\r\nit quickly failed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schemes of revision.]\r\n\r\nA poor constitution, which could be amended only by unanimous vote, was\r\nlikely to stifle the nation. A few feeble suggestions were heard that the\r\nexperiment of republican government be given over; others urged that the\r\nAmericans be brought within one centralized government. Alexander Hamilton\r\nwould have established a government \"controlling the internal police of\r\nthe States, and having a federal judiciary.\" Upon the last of his three\r\nschemes, dated 1783, is written: \"Intended to be submitted to Congress,\r\nbut abandoned for want of support.\" Even Washington's vastly greater\r\ninfluence had no effect. In a circular letter to the governors, dated\r\nJune, 1783, he says: \"It is indispensable to the happiness of the\r\nindividual States that there should be lodged somewhere a supreme power to\r\nregulate and govern the general concerns of the confederated republic.\"\r\nYet not a State would take the initiative in reforming the constitution.\r\n\r\nFrom 1784 to 1786 pamphlets began to appear in which more definite\r\nsuggestions were made for a new government. Pelatiah Webster proposed a\r\ngovernment with enlarged powers, and a legislature of two houses. \"If they\r\ndisagree,\" said he, \"let them sit still until they recover their good\r\nhumor.\" The method in which the new government was to enforce its powers\r\nwas put in a quaint and incisive form. \"My principle is,\" said Webster,\r\n\"the soul that sinneth, it shall die. Every person ... who shall disobey\r\nthe supreme authority shall be answerable to Congress.\" The idea that the\r\nconstitution needed radical amendment had at last found a lodgment in the\r\npublic mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION (1787-1789).\r\n\r\n\r\n59.

THE FEDERAL CONVENTION ASSEMBLED (1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A convention suggested.]\r\n[Sidenote: Annapolis Convention.]\r\n[Sidenote: Action of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThat Congress did not possess the confidence of the country was evident\r\nfrom the failure of all its amendments. It had, therefore, been suggested\r\nfirst by Hamilton in 1780, later by Tom Paine in his widespread pamphlet\r\n\"Public Good,\" that a convention be specially summoned to revise the\r\nArticles of Confederation. The initiative in the movement was finally\r\ntaken by the States. In 1786 the intolerable condition of internal\r\ncommerce caused Virginia to suggest to the sister States that a conference\r\nbe held at Annapolis. The few delegates who appeared separated, after\r\nrecommending that there be held \"a convention of delegates from the\r\ndifferent States ... to devise such further provisions as shall appear to\r\nthem necessary to render the constitution of the federal government\r\nadequate.\" Congress was no longer able to resist the movement: on Feb. 1,\r\n1787, it resolved that a convention be held \"for the sole and express\r\npurpose of revising the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to\r\nCongress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions\r\ntherein as shall, when agreed to by Congress and confirmed by the States,\r\nrender the federal government adequate to the exigencies of government and\r\nthe preservation of the union.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convention assembled.]\r\n\r\nBy May, 1787, delegates to the proposed convention had been chosen in all\r\nthe States except New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Many of the ablest and\r\nmost experienced public men were included. Among them were Francis Dana\r\nand Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, Alexander Hamilton of New York,\r\nBenjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, and James Madison and George Washington\r\nof Virginia. The convention was the most distinguished body which had ever\r\nassembled in America; if its work could not command public confidence,\r\nthere was no hope for the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. DIFFICULTIES OF THE CONVENTION (1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Task of the convention.]\r\n\r\nWhen on May 25, 1787, the convention assembled at Philadelphia, its task,\r\nunder the call of Congress, was limited to the preparation of amendments\r\nto the old Confederation. The first formal resolution to which it came\r\nafter organization reads as follows: \"That a national government ought to\r\nbe established, consisting of a supreme legislature, executive, and\r\njudiciary.\" The convention from the beginning was evidently resolved to\r\nrecommend a new, elaborate, and powerful form of government. The key to\r\nthis action is found in the history of the twelve years from 1775 to 1787.\r\nThe country had tried a revolutionary, irresponsible, form of government,\r\nand it had not worked well. It had tried a union of sovereign States;\r\nneither the Union nor the States had prospered. The time had come to\r\nchange the government in form, in powers, and in the means of carrying out\r\nits powers. The States must be held to their duties; Congress must be\r\nrestrained; local quarrels must cease; revenue must be secured, commerce\r\nprotected, and treaties guaranteed; the West must be saved, and\r\ninsurrections put down. The first duty of the convention was to repair the\r\nerrors of the Confederation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Want of authority.]\r\n\r\nAmericans have become accustomed to look upon the Constitution as a kind\r\nof political revelation; the members of the convention themselves felt no\r\nsense of strength or inspiration. They had no authority of their own.\r\nTheir work must be submitted for the ratification of States which had been\r\nunable to agree upon a single modification of the articles. They must\r\nencounter the jealousy of Congress and the prejudices of the people. While\r\nthe convention sat, a rumor went abroad that they would report in favor of\r\na monarchy.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring the discussion to a focus, the Virginia delegates had\r\nagreed upon a plan drawn by Madison, who had been in communication with\r\nWashington; it was presented by Edmund Randolph. This plan in the end\r\nformed the basis of the constitution as adopted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divisions.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had debate actually begun than the convention proved to be\r\ndivided into many factions. Some members, like Patterson, were on\r\nprinciple opposed to a strong government; others, like Hamilton, desired\r\nto break down the State boundaries, and to create a centralized republic.\r\nStill more distinct was the opposition between the large States and the\r\nsmall: the former inclined to a representation based on population; the\r\nlatter insisted that the States should be equal units. Again, the trading\r\nStates--New England, New York, and Maryland--were inclined to grant large\r\npowers over commerce; the agricultural States, particularly Virginia,\r\nwished to see commerce regulated still by the States in part. Another line\r\nof division was between the slaveholding and the non-slaveholding States;\r\nhere the champions were Massachusetts on one side, and South Carolina on\r\nthe other. Throughout the convention these various elements combined and\r\nrecombined as their interests seemed affected. Although there were no\r\npermanent parties, the members of which regularly voted together, there\r\nwas disagreement and disappointment from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n62. SOURCES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American experience.]\r\n\r\nAnother popular delusion with regard to the Constitution is that it was\r\ncreated out of nothing; or, as Mr. Gladstone puts it, that \"It is the\r\ngreatest work ever struck off at any one time by the mind and purpose of\r\nman.\" The radical view on the other side is expressed by Sir Henry Maine,\r\nwho informs us that the \"Constitution of the United States is a modified\r\nversion of the British Constitution ... which was in existence between\r\n1760 and 1787.\" The real source of the Constitution is the experience of\r\nAmericans. They had established and developed admirable little\r\ncommonwealths in the colonies; since the beginning of the Revolution they\r\nhad had experience of State governments organized on a different basis\r\nfrom the colonial; and, finally, they had carried on two successive\r\nnational governments, with which they had been profoundly discontented.\r\nThe general outline of the new Constitution seems to be English; it was\r\nreally colonial. The President's powers of military command, of\r\nappointment, and of veto were similar to those of the colonial governor.\r\nNational courts were created on the model of colonial courts. A\r\nlegislature of two houses was accepted because such legislatures had been\r\ncommon in colonial times. In the English Parliamentary system as it\r\nexisted before 1760 the Americans had had no share; the later English\r\nsystem of Parliamentary responsibility was not yet developed, and had\r\nnever been established in colonial governments; and they expressly\r\nexcluded it from their new Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State experience.]\r\n\r\nThey were little more affected by the experience of other European\r\nnations. Just before they assembled, Madison drew up an elaborate abstract\r\nof ancient, mediæval, and existing federal governments, of which he sent a\r\ncopy to Washington. It is impossible to trace a single clause of the\r\nConstitution to any suggestion in this paper. The chief source of the\r\ndetails of the Constitution was the State constitutions and laws then in\r\nforce. Thus the clause conferring a suspensive veto on the President is an\r\nalmost literal transcript from the Massachusetts constitution. In fact,\r\nthe principal experiment in the Constitution was the establishment of an\r\nelectoral college; and of all parts of the system this has worked least as\r\nthe framers expected. The Constitution represents, therefore, the\r\naccumulated experience of the time; its success is due to the wisdom of\r\nthe members in selecting out of the mass of colonial and State\r\ninstitutions those which were enduring,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Novelties.]\r\n\r\nThe real boldness of the Constitution is the novelty of the federal system\r\nwhich it set up. For the first time in history an elaborate written\r\nconstitution was applied to a federation; and the details were so\r\nskilfully arranged that the instrument framed for thirteen little\r\nagricultural communities works well for forty-four large and populous\r\nStates. A second novelty was a system of federal courts skilfully brought\r\ninto harmony with the State judiciary. Even here we see an effect of the\r\ntwelve years experience of imperfect federation. The convention knew how\r\nto select institutions that would stand together; it also knew how to\r\nreject what would have weakened the structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n63. THE GREAT COMPROMISES (1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State sovereignty.]\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before a compromise between the discordant elements\r\ncould be reached. To declare the country a centralized nation was to\r\ndestroy the traditions of a century and a half: to leave it an assemblage\r\nof States, each claiming independence and sovereignty, was to throw away\r\nthe results of the Revolution. The convention finally agreed that while\r\nthe Union should be endowed with adequate powers, the States should retain\r\nall powers not specifically granted, and particularly the right to\r\nregulate their own internal affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation of States.]\r\n\r\nThe next great question all but led to the breaking up of the convention.\r\nThe New Hampshire delegate had not yet appeared, and Rhode Island was\r\nnever represented in the convention; the large states had therefore a\r\nmajority of one. On June 13 it was voted that the ratio of representation\r\nin both branches of the legislature should be in proportion to the\r\npopulation. Two days later, Patterson of New Jersey brought forward a plan\r\nsatisfactory to the small States, by which the old plan of vote by States\r\nwas to be retained, and the Confederation practically continued. For many\r\ndays the two parties were unable to agree; the crisis was so serious that\r\non June 28 Franklin, who was not renowned for piety, moved that\r\nthenceforward the sessions be opened with prayer. The deadlock was finally\r\nbroken by the so-called Connecticut Compromise, adopted July 7: equal\r\nrepresentation was to be preserved in the upper house, and proportional\r\nrepresentation was to be granted in the lower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation of slaves.]\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to levy taxes on the same basis, the Southern members\r\nobjected that their negroes were not equal to freemen as producers of\r\nwealth. On July 12, the matter was adjusted by a compromise: the\r\nSoutherners agreed to count slaves only at three fifths of their number,\r\nin apportioning both representatives and direct taxes. Since direct taxes\r\nhave been but three times assessed in the history of the United States,\r\nthe practical advantage was on the side of the North.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slave trade.]\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise in the third difficult question. Near the end of the\r\nconvention the commercial and the agricultural States came into a\r\ndisagreement. New England was anxious that Congress should have power to\r\npass Acts protecting American shipping; on the other hand, the South\r\ndesired to continue the slave-trade. Pinckney declared that \"South\r\nCarolina can never receive the plan if it prohibits the slave-trade;\" and\r\nSherman of Connecticut cynically remarked, \"The slave-trade is iniquitous;\r\nbut inasmuch as the point of representation was settled, he should not\r\nobject.\" On August 24 a third compromise left to Congress the power of\r\npassing Navigation Acts, but forbade it to prohibit the slave-trade during\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n64. DETAILS OF THE CONSTITUTION (1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficult questions.]\r\n\r\nThese difficult points out of the way, the convention arranged the details\r\nof the new government. One of the principal minor questions was the method\r\nof presidential election. Many members inclined towards an executive\r\ncouncil; instead, it was agreed that there should be a President elected\r\nby Congress; but almost at the last moment, on September 7, the better\r\nplan of indirect election by the people was adopted. At one time the\r\nconvention had agreed that Congress should have the right of veto upon\r\nState laws; it was abandoned, and instead was introduced a clause that the\r\nConstitution should be the supreme law of the land, and powerful courts\r\nwere created to construe the law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Simplicity of the Constitution.]\r\n\r\nIn making up the list of the powers of Congress, the convention used brief\r\nbut comprehensive terms. Thus all the difficulties arising out of the\r\nunfriendly commercial legislation of States, and their institution, with\r\nforeign treaties, were removed by the simple clause: \"The Congress shall\r\nhave Power ... to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the\r\nseveral States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" The great question of\r\ntaxation was settled by fourteen words: \"The Congress shall have Power ...\r\nTo lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Omissions.]\r\n\r\nIn a few respects the Constitution was deficient. It did not profess to be\r\nall-comprehensive, for the details of the government were to be worked out\r\nin later statutes. There was, however, no provision for future annexations\r\nof territory. No safeguards were provided for the proper appointment and\r\nremoval of public officers. The growth of corporations was not foreseen,\r\nand no distinct power was conferred upon Congress either to create or to\r\nregulate them. Above all, the convention was obliged to leave untouched\r\nthe questions connected with slavery which later disrupted the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The work finished.]\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 17, 1787, the convention finished its work. To the eloquent and\r\nterse phraseology of Gouverneur Morris we owe the nervous English of the\r\ngreat instrument. As the members were affixing their signatures, Franklin\r\nremarked, pointing to the picture of a sun painted behind the President's\r\nchair: \"I have often and often,... in the vicissitudes of my hopes and\r\nfears, looked ... without being able to tell whether it was rising or\r\nsetting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a\r\nrising and not a setting sun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n65. DIFFICULTIES OF RATIFICATION (1787, 1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of Congress.]\r\n[Sidenote: Action of legislatures.]\r\n\r\nThe text of the Constitution was printed and rapidly distributed\r\nthroughout the Union. It was still but a lifeless draft, and before it\r\ncould become an instrument of government the approving action of Congress,\r\nof the legislatures, and of State conventions was necessary. Congress, on\r\nSept. 28, 1787, unanimously resolved that the Constitution be transmitted\r\nto State legislatures. The federal convention had determined that the\r\nconsideration of its work should not depend, like the Articles of\r\nConfederation, upon the slow and unwilling humor of the legislatures, but\r\nthat in each State a convention should be summoned solely to express the\r\nwill of the State upon the acceptance of the Constitution. It had further\r\navoided the rock upon which had been wrecked the amendments proposed by\r\nCongress; when nine State conventions should have ratified the\r\nConstitution, it was to take effect for those nine. On the same day that\r\nCongress in New York was passing its resolution, the Pennsylvania\r\nlegislature in Philadelphia was fixing the day for the election of\r\ndelegates; all the State legislatures followed, except in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Constitution attacked.]\r\n\r\nThe next six months was a period of great anxiety and of national danger.\r\nThe Constitution was violently attacked in every part of the Union: the\r\nPresident, it was urged, would be a despot, the House of Representatives a\r\ncorporate tyrant, the Senate an oligarchy. The large States protested that\r\nDelaware and Rhode Island would still neutralize the votes of Virginia and\r\nMassachusetts in the Senate. The federal courts were said to be an\r\ninnovation. It was known that there had been great divisions in the\r\nconvention, and that several influential members had left, or at the last\r\nmoment had refused to sign. \"The people of this commonwealth,\" said\r\nPatrick Henry, \"are exceedingly uneasy in being brought from that state of\r\nfull security which they enjoyed, to the present delusive appearance of\r\nthings.\" A special objection was made to the lack of a bill of rights,\r\nsuch as existed in State constitutions. The reply was that the framers of\r\nthe Constitution had deliberately omitted it because Congress was in no\r\ncase to have powers not conferred upon it by the Constitution. The\r\nargument was not conclusive: Rev. Mr. Caldwell, in the North Carolina\r\nconvention, declared that \"unalienable rights ought not to be given up if\r\nnot necessary;\" and another member of the same convention objected that\r\n\"if there be no religious test required, Pagans, Deists, and Mahometans\r\nmight obtain offices, And ... the senators and representatives might all\r\nbe pagans.\" It was even suggested as a serious danger that the Pope of\r\nRome might eventually be elected president.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Federalists and Antifederalists.]\r\n\r\nThe friends of the measure, in order to deprecate the charge that they\r\naimed at centralization, took upon themselves the name of Federalists.\r\nTheir opponents called themselves antifederalists, corresponded with each\r\nother, and formed a short-lived national party. A shower of pamphlets on\r\nboth sides fell upon the country. Of these the most famous and most\r\nefficacious was the \"Federalist,\" successive numbers of which were\r\ncontributed by Hamilton, Madison, and John Jay. With a calmness of spirit,\r\na lucidity of style, and a power of logic which make it to this day one of\r\nthe most important commentaries on the Constitution, the \"Federalist\"\r\nstrove to show that the Constitution was safe for the people and\r\nadvantageous for the States.\r\n\r\n\r\n66. STATE CONVENTIONS (1787, 1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First nine states.]\r\n\r\nAs the State conventions assembled, the excitement grew more intense. Four\r\nStates alone contained within a few thousands of half the population of\r\nthe Union: they were Massachusetts, Virginia, New York, and North\r\nCarolina. In the convention of each of these States there was opposition\r\nstrong and stubborn; one of them--North Carolina--adjourned without\r\naction; in the other three, ratification was obtained with extreme\r\ndifficulty and by narrow majorities.\r\n\r\nThe first State to come under the \"New Roof,\" as the Constitution was\r\npopularly called, was Delaware. In rapid succession followed Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut. In Massachusetts, the sixth State,\r\nthere was a hard fight; the spirit of the Shays Rebellion was still alive;\r\nthe opposition of Samuel Adams was only overcome by showing him that he\r\nwas in the minority; John Hancock was put out of the power to interfere by\r\nmaking him the silent president of the convention. It was suggested that\r\nMassachusetts ratify on condition that a long list of amendments be\r\nadopted by the new government: the friends of the Constitution pointed out\r\nthat the plan was simply to ratify a part of the Constitution and to\r\nreject the rest; each succeeding State would insist on a list of\r\namendments, and the whole work must be done over. Feb. 6, 1788, the\r\nenthusiastic people of Boston knew that the convention, by a vote of 187\r\nto 167, had ratified the Constitution; the amendments being added, not as\r\na condition, but as a suggestion. Maryland, South Carolina, and New\r\nHampshire brought the number up to nine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia and New York.]\r\n\r\nBefore the ninth ratification was known, the fight had been won also in\r\nVirginia. Among the champions of the Constitution were Madison, Edmund\r\nRandolph, and John Marshall. James Monroe argued against the system of\r\nelection which was destined twice to make him President. In spite of the\r\ndetermined opposition of Patrick Henry, and in spite of a proposition to\r\nratify with amendments, the convention accepted. New York still held off.\r\nHer acquiescence was geographically necessary; and Alexander Hamilton, by\r\nthe power of his eloquence and his reason, changed the vote of a hostile\r\nconvention and added the eleventh State.\r\n\r\n\r\n67. EXPIRATION OF THE CONFEDERATION (1788).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The old Congress.]\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the convention in Philadelphia Congress had\r\ncontinued to sit in New York, and the Northwest Ordinance was passed at\r\nthis time (§ 52). On Sept. 13, 1788 Congress voted that the Constitution\r\nhad been ratified, and that elections should proceed for the officers of\r\nthe new government, which was to go into operation the first Wednesday in\r\nMarch, 1789.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seat of government.]\r\n[Sidenote: Congress expires.]\r\n\r\nSince Congress and the President must meet somewhere, it became the duty\r\nof the old Congress to fix, at least temporarily, the seat of government,\r\nTrenton, Lancaster, Princeton, and New York were suggested. Baltimore was\r\nvoted; then, with its usual inconsistency, two days later Congress voted\r\nfor New York. An attempt was made to settle the accounts of Congress; but\r\nall that could be ascertained was that they were in great confusion, and\r\nthat vouchers had not yet been turned in for the expenditure of large\r\nsums. On October 23 is the last official record: \"Two States attended.\"\r\nDuring the next five months the only evidences of national life were the\r\nperfunctory service of a few executive officers, the feeble movements of\r\nthe army, now reduced to about six hundred men, and the steady\r\naccumulation of unpaid interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rhode Island and North Carolina.]\r\n\r\nWhat, meantime, was the situation of the two States, Rhode Island and\r\nNorth Carolina, which had not ratified the Constitution, and which were,\r\ntherefore, not entitled to take part in the elections? They had in 1781\r\nentered into a constitution which was to be amended only by unanimous\r\nconsent; their consent was refused; legally they had a right to insist on\r\nthe continuance of the old Congress. The new Constitution was, strictly\r\nspeaking, unconstitutional; it had been ratified by a process unknown to\r\nlaw. The situation was felt to be delicate, and the States were for the\r\ntime being left to themselves. North Carolina came into the Union by a\r\nratification of Nov. 21, 1789. It was suggested that the trade of States\r\nwhich did not recognize Congress should be cut off, and Rhode Island\r\nyielded. May 19, 1790, her ratification completed the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n68. WAS THE CONSTITUTION A COMPACT?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Constitution irregular.]\r\n\r\nThe third attempt to form an organic union was now successfully carried\r\nout. The irregular authority of the Continental Congress had been replaced\r\nby the legal but inefficient Confederation; to this was now to succeed an\r\norganized government, complete in all its departments, and well endowed\r\nwith powers. How had this Constitution been adopted? What was the\r\nauthority which had taken upon itself to diminish the powers of the\r\nStates, and to disregard the clauses which required unanimous consent to\r\namendments? Was the new Constitution an agreement between eleven States,\r\nor was it an instrument of government for the whole people? Upon this\r\nquestion depends the whole discussion about the nature of the Union and\r\nthe right of secession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compact theory.]\r\n\r\nThe first theory is that the Constitution was a compact made between\r\nsovereign States. Thus Hayne in 1830 declared that \"Before the\r\nConstitution each state was an independent sovereignty, possessing all the\r\nrights and powers appertaining to independent nations.... After the\r\nConstitution was formed, they remained equally sovereign and independent\r\nas to all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government.... The\r\ntrue nature of the Federal Constitution, therefore, is ... a compact to\r\nwhich the States are parties.\" The importance of the word \"compact\" is\r\nthat it means an agreement which loses its force when any one of the\r\nparties ceases to observe it; a compact is little more than a treaty.\r\nThose who framed the Constitution appeared to consider it no compact; for\r\non May 30, 1787, Mr. Randolph moved that \"-no treaty or treaties among the\r\nwhole or part of the States, as individual sovereignties, would be\r\nsufficient.\" In fact, the reason for the violent opposition to the\r\nratification of the Constitution was that when once ratified, the States\r\ncould not withdraw from it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution theory.]\r\n\r\nAnother view is presented by Webster in his reply to Hayne: \"It is, sir,\r\nthe people's Constitution, the people's government, made for the people,\r\nmade by the people, and answerable to the people. The people of the United\r\nStates have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law.\" It\r\nis plain that the Constitution does not rest simply upon the consent of\r\nthe majority of the nation. No popular vote was taken or thought of; each\r\nact of ratification set forth that it proceeded from a convention of the\r\npeople of a State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Basis of the Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe real nature of the new Constitution appears in the light of the\r\nprevious history of the country. The Articles of Confederation had been a\r\ncompact. One of the principal reasons why the Confederation was weak was\r\nthat there was no way of compelling the States to perform their duties.\r\nThe new Constitution was meant to be stronger and more permanent. The\r\nConstitution was, then, not a compact, but an instrument of government\r\nsimilar in its origin to the constitutions of the States. The difference\r\nwas that, by general agreement, it was not to take effect until it was\r\nshown that in at least nine States the people were willing to live under\r\nit. Whatever the defects of the Confederation, however humiliating its\r\nweakness to our national pride, it had performed an indispensable service;\r\nit had educated the American people to the point where they were willing\r\nto accept a permanent federal union. As the \"Federalist\" put it, \"A nation\r\nwithout a national government is an awful spectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT (1789-1793).\r\n\r\n\r\n69.

GEOGRAPHY OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary questions.]\r\n\r\nWhat were the physical, social, and political conditions under which the\r\nnew government was to be established? In 1789 the exterior boundaries of\r\nthe country were loosely defined by treaty (§ 46), but were not yet marked\r\nout, and there were several serious controversies. From the mouth of the\r\nSt, Croix River to the head of the Connecticut the boundary was in\r\nconfusion, and no progress had been made towards settling it. The water-\r\nline through the St. Lawrence and the Lakes was still unadjusted. It was\r\nfound that the headwaters of the Mississippi lay to the south of the Lake\r\nof the Woods, so that there was a gap on the northwest. On the south Spain\r\ndisputed the right of Great Britain to establish the boundary, insisted\r\nthat her own undoubted settlements lay within the territory claimed by the\r\nUnited States, and declined to grant the free navigation of the lower\r\nMississippi to the sea. Still more humiliating was the presence of British\r\ngarrisons at Fort Niagara, Detroit, and other points within the undisputed\r\nboundaries of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interior boundaries.]\r\n\r\nThe interior boundaries of the country were in a like unsettled condition.\r\nNeither North Carolina nor Georgia had yielded up their western claims (§\r\n52). Vermont had not yet been recognized by New York as outside of her\r\njurisdiction, and the Western Reserve lay along the southern shore of Lake\r\nErie as an outlying part of Connecticut. No territorial government had\r\nbeen established for the Northwest territory, although settlement had\r\nbegun to pour in. The southern territory was in complete confusion:\r\nKentucky and the Tennessee valley were practically independent\r\ncommunities; and Georgia claimed the whole region south of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n71. THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Population.]\r\n\r\nA census taken in 1790 gives us the number of inhabitants as a little\r\nunder 4,000,000. Of these, 750,000--nearly one-fifth of the whole\r\npopulation--were negroes. Of the 3,170,000 whites, the ancestors of eight-\r\ntenths were probably English, and most of the others spoke English and\r\nwere a homogeneous part of the community. Counting by sections, the States\r\nnorth of Maryland had a population of 1,968,000, and those south of\r\nPennsylvania had 1,925,000; the States which were to be permanently slave-\r\nholding contained, therefore, a population about equal to that of New\r\nEngland and the Middle States. Only a small part of this population was to\r\nbe found west of the mountains. Settlement was working into central New\r\nYork, southwest Pennsylvania, the neighboring parts of Virginia, and the\r\nupper waters of the Tennessee; but the only considerable western community\r\nwas in Kentucky. These distant settlers had an important influence on the\r\nUnion, since they lay within easy reach of the Spanish settlements, and\r\noccasionally threatened to withdraw.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intellectual life.]\r\n\r\nThe intellectual life of the people was little developed. Schools had not\r\nsensibly improved since colonial times. The graduating classes of all the\r\ncolleges in 1789 count up to about 170. There were but two schools of\r\nmedicine in the country, and no regular school of law. In one department\r\nof literature alone were the Americans eminent: the state papers of public\r\nmen such as Washington, Hamilton, and Jefferson are written with the force\r\nand directness of the best school of English. Poetry there was; its\r\ncharacter may be judged by a single quotation from Barlow's \"Vision of\r\nColumbus,\" a favorite epic, published in 1787:--\r\n\r\n  \"There stood stern Putnam, seamed with many a scar,\r\n  The veteran honours of an earlier war;\r\n  Undaunted Stirling, dreadful to his foes,\r\n  And Gates and Sullivan to vengeance rose;\r\n  While brave McDougall, steady and sedate,\r\n  Stretched the nerved arm to ope the scene of fate.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic conditions.]\r\n\r\nIn economic conditions the United States were little more advanced than\r\nhad been the colonies. The country abounded in natural resources: timber\r\nclad the whole Appalachian range, and spread far into the Mississippi\r\nvalley; the virgin soil, and particularly the rich and untouched prairies\r\nof the West, were an accumulation of unmeasured wealth. Yet it was little\r\neasier to get from the sea to Lake Erie or to the Ohio than it had been\r\nforty years before. It seemed impossible that a country could be held\r\ntogether when it was so large that a courier might be two months on his\r\nway from the seat of government to the most distant frontier; and\r\nJefferson predicted that it would be a thousand years before the country\r\nwould be thickly settled as far west as the Mississippi. The chief\r\nresource of the country was agriculture; almost every State raised its own\r\nfood, and there were considerable exports, particularly of wheat and\r\nflour. Manufactures were chiefly imported from England, the only widely\r\nknown American industry being the distilling of New England rum. The chief\r\nsource of wealth was still commerce; in 1790 the exports and imports were\r\nabout twenty million dollars each, or five dollars per head of the\r\npopulation. The movement of vessels to foreign ports was tolerably free,\r\nbut the vexatious restrictions and taxes imposed by England tended to\r\nthrow an undue part of the profit into the hands of the English merchants.\r\nBusiness of every kind was much hampered by the want of bank capital and\r\nby the state of the currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n72. POLITICAL METHODS IN 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Current political theories.]\r\n\r\nThe chief intellectual interest of the people was in politics. The State\r\nand the national constitutions both protected freedom of speech, and\r\nAmericans were accustomed freely to discuss public men and public\r\nmeasures. Public opinion was, however, created by a comparatively small\r\nnumber of persons,--the leading planters of the South, merchants and great\r\nfamilies in the Middle States, the gentlemen and clergy in New England.\r\nAlready two different schools of political thought had appeared. The one\r\nis typified by John Adams's elaborate work, \"The Defence of the American\r\nConstitutions,\" published in 1787. \"The rich, the well-born, and the\r\nable,\" he says, \"... must be separated from the mass and placed by\r\nthemselves in a senate.\" The leading spirit in the other school was Thomas\r\nJefferson. He wrote in 1787: \"I am persuaded that the good sense of the\r\npeople will always be found the best army. They may be led astray for a\r\nmoment, but will soon correct themselves.\" The accepted principle of\r\nrepublican government was nevertheless that there should be a limited\r\nnumber of voters, following the lead of experienced statesmen of a higher\r\nsocial class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political methods.]\r\n\r\nA few symptoms of a change in political methods were visible. In 1788 a\r\nnominating convention was held in Harrisburg; this method of selecting\r\ncandidates by representatives of the voters of their party was rapidly\r\nextended. In 1789 the secret Columbian Order, or Tammany Society, was\r\nformed in New York. At first benevolent and literary, the correspondent of\r\nthe Massachusetts Historical Society, by 1800 it had become a political\r\norganization and was controlling local elections. In several States, and\r\nparticularly in New York, factions had grown up about leading families of\r\npublic men; in a few years they became political machines subject to the\r\ndirection of a few leaders. Buying of votes was almost unknown, but there\r\nwas much disorder at elections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Respect for authority.]\r\n\r\nIn many respects both the State and national governments were weak. The\r\nlegislatures had, during the Revolution, been accustomed to ride roughshod\r\nover the minority, and they were still inclined to grant charters and\r\nprivileges only to party friends; Federalist legislatures would charter\r\nonly Federalist banks. Americans enjoyed their individual liberty, but\r\nresented the use of force either for collecting taxes or for upholding the\r\nauthority of government; and the States were not accustomed unhesitatingly\r\nto accept the action of Congress. On the other hand, the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrespect for law was recovering from the shock of the Revolution. There was\r\na strong feeling of loyalty to the State governments, and the beginning of\r\nnational interest and patriotism. By common consent the new Constitution\r\nwas put quietly into effect by those who expected its success.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS (1789).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First congressional election.]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the organization of the government was to elect senators\r\nand representatives. The Senate was small, and was expected to be a kind\r\nof executive council. In due time John Adams was chosen vice-president,\r\nand became chairman. The Senate sat for several years in secret session;\r\nbut from the journal of William Maclay, senator from Pennsylvania, we\r\nlearn many interesting details, and know that the casting vote of the\r\nchairman was often necessary to settle important questions. The time and\r\nmanner of electing members of the House was left to the States. In some\r\ncases all the members from a State were elected on one general ticket; in\r\nothers the State was divided into districts. Among the distinguished\r\nmembers were Theodore Sedgwick and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts,\r\nJonathan Trumbull of Connecticut, and James Madison of Virginia. From the\r\nfirst, the custom obtained that a member of the House should be a resident\r\nof the district from which he was chosen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organization of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe House organized April 6. In the Speaker appeared an officer until now\r\nunknown in the Federal system. At first he was only a moderator; after\r\nabout a year he was given the power to appoint committees; and from that\r\ntime dates the growth of those powers which have made him second in\r\ninfluence only to the President of the United States. The procedure was\r\nmodelled partly on that of the old Congress, and partly upon that of the\r\nState legislatures: it is noticeable, however, that the system of\r\npermanent committees so familiar during the previous twelve years was not\r\nimmediately readopted; It began to come in about 1794. The first act on\r\nthe statute book was passed June 1, 1789, and prescribed a form of oath.\r\nCongress voted itself a moderate per diem of six dollars. The only other\r\nimportant question relative to the form of Congress was that of\r\napportionment. On April 5, 1792, a bill allotting the members of the House\r\nto the States was the subject of the first executive veto.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amendments.]\r\n\r\nOne important function was performed before Congress adjourned, by\r\nsubmitting to the States twelve amendments to the Constitution. These were\r\nmade up by comparison of the propositions submitted by the States at the\r\ntime of ratification, and practically constituted a brief bill of rights.\r\nIn due time all but two unimportant clauses were ratified by the States,\r\nand the great objection to the Constitution was thus removed.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the First Congress was that the general forms adopted\r\nfor the transaction of its business have continued without serious change\r\nto the present day. Its officers have increased, its powers have\r\ndeveloped, its political importance has expanded; but its parliamentary\r\nprocedure is still much the same as in 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n74. ORGANIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE (1789, 1790).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first President.]\r\n\r\nWhile the senators and representatives were being selected, Presidential\r\nelectors were also chosen in all the eleven States except New York. The\r\nStates exercised their constitutional discretion: in some the electors\r\nwere chosen by the legislatures, in others by general ticket, and in\r\nothers by districts. In one thing they agreed: when quorums of both houses\r\nwere obtained, so that the votes could be counted, April 6, 1789, it was\r\nfound that every elector had cast a ballot for George Washington. On April\r\n30 he took the oath of office in Federal Hall on Wall Street, New York,\r\nand Maclay records for the benefit of posterity that \"he was dressed in\r\ndeep brown, with metal buttons with an eagle on them, white stockings, a\r\nbag, and sword.\" As the presidency was an entirely new office, there was\r\nmuch difficulty and some squabbling over the details of his place. The\r\nquestion of title was raised; and it was understood that Washington would\r\nhave liked to be called \"His High Mightiness, the President of the United\r\nStates and Protector of their Liberties.\" No action was taken, and the\r\nsimple title of \"Mr. President\" was by common consent adopted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive departments.]\r\n[Sidenote: Treasury Department.]\r\n\r\nThe duties of the President were clearly defined by the Constitution. It\r\nnow became necessary to make some provision for subordinate executive\r\nofficers. Here for the first time the importance of the legislation of the\r\nFirst Congress is visible. They had it in their power to put flesh and\r\nblood upon the dry bones of the Constitution: they might surround the\r\nPresident with a vigorous, active, and well-centred body of subordinates;\r\nor they might go back to the practice of the old Congress, and create\r\nexecutive officers who should be practically the servants of Congress.\r\nThey resolved to trust the President. The first executive department to be\r\nestablished was the Department of Foreign Affairs, of which the name was a\r\nlittle latter changed to the Department of State. In due time Thomas\r\nJefferson was appointed Secretary of State; among his successors have been\r\nJohn Marshall, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay,\r\nMartin Van Buren, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan, and\r\nWilliam H, Seward. The War Department bill passed August 7, and Henry\r\nKnox, who had been the head of the army under the old system, was\r\nreappointed. In establishing the Treasury Department a strong effort was\r\nmade to create a Secretary of the Treasury as an agent of Congress rather\r\nthan as the officer of the President. The details of the office were\r\ntherefore carefully regulated by the statute, and specific duties were\r\nassigned to the Secretary. He was, however, appointed by the President,\r\nand the question was raised whether he was also removable by the\r\nPresident. The Senate insisted that the removal should not be valid\r\nwithout its approval; the House insisted that the President should be\r\nunrestrained by the casting vote of the Vice-President the latter system\r\nwas adopted. The first Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with Congress.]\r\n\r\nThen came the question of the relations of cabinet officers to Congress.\r\nMaclay records that on August 22, 1790, the President appeared in the\r\nSenate with Knox, and intimated that the Secretary of War would explain a\r\nproposed Indian treaty. The only remark that Knox seems to have made was:\r\n\"Not till Saturday next;\" but Maclay was convinced that he was there \"to\r\noverawe the timid and neutral part of the Senate.\" With some displeasure,\r\nthe Senate referred the matter to a committee. Hamilton desired an\r\nopportunity to address the House; but it was not accorded, nor does it\r\nappear that the privilege has ever been granted to any cabinet officer.\r\nKnox's speech is the nearest approach to the Parliamentary system which\r\nhas been known in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n75. ORGANIZATION OF THE COURTS (1789-1793).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Judiciary Act.]\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution there was to be a supreme court and such inferior\r\ncourts as Congress should create. By the Act of Sept. 24, 1789 the federal\r\njudicial system was organized substantially as it now stands. Following\r\nthe precedent of some of the States, two grades of inferior courts were\r\ncreated,--the district and the circuit. The judicial business of the\r\ncountry was small, and for the time being the supreme justices were to\r\nhold the circuit courts. Prosecuting officers and marshals were appointed,\r\nand here is to be found the germ of the present system of limited terms\r\nfor public officials: they were to have commissions which should run four\r\nyears; it seems to have been tacitly understood that they would be\r\nreappointed. A few brief clauses defined the manner in which suits could\r\nbe appealed from the State courts to the national. This statute has made\r\nit possible to apply federal law in the same way throughout the Union:\r\nerrors of construction, and divergencies of judgment involving the\r\nnational Constitution, laws, and treaties, are corrected through this\r\npower of appeal to one central supreme tribunal. A little later an Act was\r\npassed defining crimes against the United States. The courts were speedily\r\norganized, and John Jay of New York was made the first chief justice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Important decisions.]\r\n\r\nFor a few years no important decisions were made by the court; but in\r\nFebruary, 1793, a suit was entertained against the State of Georgia; soon\r\nafter, one was entered against the State of Massachusetts. Georgia replied\r\nby passing a statute punishing with death any United States marshal who\r\nmight attempt to serve a process upon her. Massachusetts urged the passing\r\nof an eleventh constitutional amendment; it was duly adopted in 1798, and\r\nprohibited suits before a federal court against a State, by a citizen of\r\nanother State or of a foreign country.\r\n\r\n\r\n76. REVENUE AND PROTECTION (1789-1792).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revenue scheme.]\r\n\r\nThe first necessity of the new government was to lay the taxes authorized\r\nunder the new Constitution for its own support, for the payment of\r\ninterest, and eventually for sinking the principal of the public debt. Two\r\ndays after the House organized, Madison introduced a scheme, which\r\neventually passed into the first tariff act. On May 13, 1789, after\r\nagreeing to a duty on \"looking-glasses and brushes,\" it was moved to lay a\r\ntax of ten dollars each on imported slaves. A Georgia member protested\r\nagainst the tax as intended for the benefit of Virginia, and \"hoped\r\ngentlemen would have some feeling for others;\" the proposition failed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of protection.]\r\n\r\nAnother amendment, however, raised the most important political question\r\nconnected with taxation. April 9, 1789, a Pennsylvania member wished to\r\nincrease the list of dutiable articles, so as \"to encourage the\r\nproductions of our country and to protect our infant manufactures.\" A\r\nSouth Carolina member at once objected. Two days later a petition from\r\nBaltimore manufacturers asked Congress to impose on \"all foreign articles\r\nwhich can be made in America such duties as will give a just and decided\r\npreference to our labors.\" New England opposed the proposed duties because\r\nmolasses, hemp, and flax were included; molasses was a \"raw material\" for\r\nthe manufacture of rum; and hemp and flax were essential for the cordage\r\nof New England ships. Lee of Virginia moved to strike out the duty on\r\nsteel, since a supply could not be furnished within the United States, and\r\nhe thought it an \"oppressive, though indirect, tax on agriculture.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first tariff.]\r\n\r\nThe act as passed July 4, 1789, bore the title of \"An Act for the\r\nencouragement and protection of manufactures;\" yet the highest ad valorem\r\nduty was fifteen per cent. To be sure, the high rates of freight at that\r\ntime afforded a very large additional protection; but no general revenue\r\nact ever passed by Congress has imposed so low a scale of duties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamilton's scheme.]\r\n\r\nBy the time the revenue had begun to come in under this Act, Secretary\r\nHamilton had worked out in his mind a general financial system, intended\r\nto raise the credit and to strengthen the authority of the Union. The\r\nfirst step was to provide a sufficient revenue to pay running expenses and\r\ninterest. Finding that the first tariff produced too little revenue, in\r\n1790 and again in 1792 it was slightly increased, at Hamilton's\r\nsuggestion. The second part of his scheme was to lay an excise, an\r\ninternal duty upon distilled spirits. In 1791 a tax, in its highest form\r\nbut twenty-five cents a gallon, was laid on spirits distilled from foreign\r\nor domestic materials. The actual amount of revenue from this source was\r\nalways small; but Hamilton expected that the people in the interior would\r\nthus become accustomed to federal officers and to federal law. The effect\r\nof the revenue Acts was quickly visible: in 1792 the annual revenue of the\r\ngovernment had risen to $3,600,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n77. NATIONAL AND STATE DEBTS (1789, 1790).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The debt funded.]\r\n\r\nThe third part of Hamilton's scheme was to fund the national debt into one\r\nsystem of bonds, and to pay the interest. When he assumed control of the\r\nTreasury he found, as nearly as could be calculated, ten millions of\r\nforeign debt with about two millions of accrued interest, and twenty-nine\r\nmillions of domestic debt with eleven millions of accrued interest,--a\r\ntotal of more than fifty-two millions. So far as there was any sale for\r\nUnited States securities they had fallen to about twenty-five per cent of\r\ntheir par value. Jan. 14, 1790, Hamilton submitted one of a series of\r\nelaborate financial reports; it called on Congress to make such provision\r\nfor principal and interest as would restore confidence. By this time an\r\nopposition had begun to rise against the great secretary, and Madison\r\nproposed to inquire in each case what the holder of a certificate of debt\r\nhad paid for it; he was to be reimbursed in that amount, and the balance\r\nof the principal was to be paid to the original holder. Hamilton pointed\r\nout that in order to place future loans the Treasury must assure the\r\npublic that bonds would be paid in full to the person holding a legal\r\ntitle. Congress accepted Hamilton's view, and an act was passed by which\r\nthe interest was to be promptly paid, and an annual sum to be set apart\r\nfor the redemption of the principal. The securities of the United States\r\ninstantly began to rise, and in 1793 they were quoted at par. The credit\r\nof the government was reestablished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assumption proposed.]\r\n\r\nNow came a fourth part of Hamilton's scheme, upon which he laid great\r\nstress: he proposed that the outstanding State debts should likewise be\r\ntaken over by the general government. The argument was that the States had\r\nincurred their debts for the common purpose of supporting the Revolution.\r\nThere was strong opposition, particularly from States like Virginia, which\r\nhad extinguished the greater part of their own debt. The House showed a\r\nbare majority in favor of the assumption project; on the appearance of\r\nmembers from North Carolina, which had just entered the Union, that\r\nmajority was, on April 12, 1790, reversed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seat of government.]\r\n[Sidenote: Compromise.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old question of the permanent seat of the federal government\r\nhad been revived, and, as in the days of the Confederation, it seemed\r\nimpossible to agree. It was expected that the capital would lie somewhere\r\nin the Northern States; at one time Germantown was all but selected. The\r\nVirginia members suddenly took fire, and Lee declared that \"he was averse\r\nto sound alarms or introduce terror into the House, but if they were well\r\nfounded he thought it his duty;\" and Jackson of Georgia declared that\r\n\"this will blow the coals of sedition and injure the Union.\" The matter\r\nwas laid over until the middle of 1790. It was evident that the friends of\r\nassumption were in a small minority, and the friends of a Northern capital\r\nin a small majority. Hamilton worked upon Jefferson to secure a\r\ncompromise. The matter was adjusted at Jefferson's table: a few Northern\r\nvotes were obtained for a Southern capital, and two Virginia members\r\nagreed to vote for assumption. By very narrow majorities it was therefore\r\nagreed that the national capital should be placed on the Potomac River,\r\nand that State debts amounting to $21,500,000 should be assumed. A few\r\nmonths later the President selected the site of the present national\r\ncapital, and in due time the debts were taken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n78. UNITED STATES BANK (1791, 1792).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A bank proposed.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus reorganized the finances of the country, Hamilton now proposed\r\nthe fifth part of his scheme,--the establishment of a national bank. In a\r\nreport of Dec. 14, 1790, he presented the subject to the attention of\r\nCongress. He urged that it would benefit the public by offering an\r\ninvestment, that it would aid the government in making loans and by\r\ncollecting taxes, and that its notes would be a useful currency. Hamilton\r\ndrafted a bill, which was an adaptation of the charter of the Bank of\r\nEngland. The capital of $10,000,000, and the management of the bank, were\r\nto be private; but the government was to be a stockholder, and to have the\r\nright of requiring periodical statements of the bank's condition.\r\n\r\nThe Senate passed the bill without a division, substantially as drawn by\r\nHamilton. Apparently it was on the point of going through the House, when\r\nSmith of South Carolina objected, and Jackson of Georgia declared that he\r\nhad never seen a bank bill in the State of Georgia; \"nor will they ever\r\nbenefit the farmers of that State or of New York;\" and he called it an\r\nunconstitutional monopoly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of implied powers.]\r\n\r\nAfter a week's debate on the question whether the bank was authorized by\r\nthe Constitution, it passed the House by a vote of 39 to 20, and was sent\r\nto the President. He called for the opinions of the members of his cabinet\r\nin writing, and the answers submitted by Hamilton and Jefferson are still\r\namong the most important documents on the construction of the\r\nConstitution. Jefferson's standpoint was simply that, since the\r\nConstitution nowhere expressly authorized the creation of a bank, Congress\r\nhad gone beyond its powers. Hamilton asserted that if the bank were\r\n\"necessary and proper to carry out any of the specific powers, such as\r\ntaxation and the borrowing of money, then Congress might create a bank, or\r\nany other public institution, to serve its ends.\" The President accepted\r\nHamilton's view, and the act was signed. The capital of the bank was\r\nspeedily subscribed, and it immediately entered on a prosperous and useful\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n79. SLAVERY QUESTIONS (1789-1798).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-slavery memorials.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the extent of the powers of Congress had already once been\r\nraised. On February 11 and 12, 1790, there were presented to Congress two\r\nmemorials, the one the \"Address of the People called Quakers, in their\r\nAnnual Assembly convened;\" the other the \"Memorial of the Pennsylvania\r\nSociety for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery.\" These memorials asked\r\nCongress to \"exert upright endeavors, to the full extent of your power, to\r\nremove every obstruction to public righteousness,\" particularly in the\r\nmatter of slavery. The motion to commit instantly roused Southern members.\r\nJackson of Georgia said that \"any extraordinary attention of Congress to\r\nthe petition would hold their property in jeopardy.\" The matter was sent\r\nto a subcommittee, composed chiefly of Southern members. On March 8th that\r\ncommittee reported the principles under which Congress acted during the\r\nnext seventy years. They said that Congress had no power to interfere with\r\nslavery or the treatment of slaves within the States; they might pass laws\r\nregulating the slave-trade, but could not then stop the importation of\r\nslaves from foreign countries into the United States. Another resolution,\r\nto the effect that Congress would exercise its powers for the humane\r\nprinciples of the memorial, was struck out by the House. The anti-slavery\r\norganizations from which these memorials had proceeded kept up a brisk\r\nfusillade of petitions. In some cases the House refused to receive them,\r\nbut Congress did pass several laws reducing the evils of the slave-trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fugitive slaves.]\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the question came up, how fugitive slaves should be restored if\r\nthey had fled and taken refuge in another State. An act was passed by\r\nwhich the United States assumed authority in the matter; the claimant was\r\nsimply to satisfy any national or State magistrate that he was entitled to\r\nthe person claimed. The act had hardly gone into effect before a fugitive\r\nwas apprehended in Massachusetts. Josiah Quincy, who was employed to\r\ndefend him, tells us that he \"heard a noise, and turning round he saw the\r\nconstables lying sprawling on the floor, and a passage opening through the\r\ncrowd, through which the fugitive was taking his departure, without\r\nstopping to hear the opinion of the court.\" From the very first,\r\ntherefore, we find in vigorous action the paraphernalia of the later anti-\r\nslavery movement,--societies, petitions, laws, and deliberate violation of\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n80. THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The government established.]\r\n\r\nThe end of Washington's first administration in March, 1793, saw the\r\ngovernment completely organized, and accepted throughout the Union. The\r\ndistinction between friends and opponents of the Constitution had entirely\r\ndisappeared. There was no longer any suggestion of substantial amendment.\r\nTwo Congresses had gone through their work, and had accustomed the people\r\nto a national legislature. The President had made appointments, sent\r\nambassadors, commanded the army, and vetoed bills, and yet there was no\r\nfear of a monarchy. The national courts were in regular and undisturbed\r\nsession. The Union was complete, and two new States, Vermont and Kentucky,\r\nhad been admitted.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable success was due in considerable part to the personal\r\ninfluence of a few men. Washington's great popularity and his\r\ndisinterested use of his new powers had taken away a multitude of fears.\r\nThe skill of Hamilton had built up a successful financial system. In\r\nCongress Madison had been efficient in working out the details of\r\nlegislation. Washington, with his remarkable judgment of men, had selected\r\nan able staff of officials, representing all the sections of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosperity]\r\n\r\nYet, as Washington himself had said, \"Influence is not government.\" One of\r\nthe chief elements of the Union's strength was that it pressed lightly\r\nupon the people. For the first time in the history of America there was an\r\nefficient system of import duties. They were almost the sole form of\r\ntaxation, and, like all indirect taxes, their burden was not felt. Above\r\nall, the commercial benefits of the new Union were seen from North to\r\nSouth. Trade between the States was absolutely unhampered, and a brisk\r\ninterchange of products went on. The country was prosperous; its shipping\r\nincreased, and foreign trade was also growing steadily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with the States.]\r\n\r\nSo far the Union had met no violent resistance either from insurgents or\r\nfrom the States. In the Virginia convention of 1788 Patrick Henry had\r\nsaid: \"I never will give up that darling word 'requisitions;' my country\r\nmay give it up, the majority may wrest it from me, but I never will give\r\nit up till my grave.\" Nevertheless, when the requisitions on the States\r\nwere given up, the chief cause of dispute in the Union was removed. Up to\r\nthis time the only distinctly sectional legislation had been the\r\nassumption of the State debts and the fixing of the national capital; and\r\nthese two had been set off against each other. If peace continued, there\r\nwas every prospect of a healthy growth of national spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL SUPREMACY (1793-1801).\r\n\r\n\r\n81.

FORMATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES (1792-1794).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of parties.]\r\n\r\nDuring the four uneventful years from 1789 to 1793 two political parties\r\nhad been slowly developed. Some writers have imagined that these two\r\nparties were a survival of the Revolutionary Whigs and Tories; some have\r\ntraced them back to the debate on the assumption of State debts. John\r\nAdams, years later, went to the heart of the matter when he said: \"You say\r\nour divisions began with Federalism and anti-Federalism. Alas! they began\r\nwith human nature.\" The foundation for the first two great national\r\nparties was a difference of opinion as to the nature and proper functions\r\nof the new government.\r\n\r\nDuring the second Congress, from 1791 to 1793, arose an opposition to\r\nHamilton which gradually consolidated into a party. It came chiefly from\r\nthe Southern and Middle States, and represented districts in which there\r\nwas little capital or trade. Arrayed among his supporters were most of the\r\nrepresentatives from New England, and many from the Middle States and\r\nSouth Carolina: they represented the commercial interests of the country;\r\nthey desired to see the debt funded and the State debts assumed; they\r\nbegan to act together as another party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamilton and Jefferson.]\r\n\r\nThe final form taken by these two parties depended much upon the character\r\nof their leaders. Hamilton, a man of great personal force and of strong\r\naristocratic feeling, represented the principle of authority, of\r\ngovernment framed and administered by a select few for the benefit of\r\ntheir fellows. Jefferson, an advocate of popular government extended to a\r\npoint never before reached, declared that his party was made up of those\r\n\"who identified themselves with the people, have confidence in them,\r\ncherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the\r\nmost wise depositary of the public interest.\" Between two such men\r\ncontroversies were certain to arise. In May, 1792, Jefferson wrote that\r\nHamilton had introduced speculation and a dangerous construction of the\r\nconstitution; and Hamilton wrote that Jefferson was at the head of a\r\nhostile faction dangerous to the Union. Washington attempted to make\r\nhimself an arbiter of this quarrel, but was unable to reconcile the two\r\nmen. They both urged him to accept a second term for the presidency, and\r\nhe was again unanimously elected in 1792. The quarrel between the two\r\ngreat chiefs had by this time got abroad. Hamilton was said to be a\r\nmonarchist. His administration of the Treasury was attacked, and an\r\ninvestigation was held early in 1793; but no one was able to find any\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Party names.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the followers of Jefferson had begun to take upon themselves\r\nthe name of Republicans. They held that the government ought to raise and\r\nspend as little money as possible; beyond that they rested upon the\r\nprinciples first definitely stated in Jefferson's opinion on the bank (§\r\n96) that Congress was confined in its powers to the letter of the\r\nConstitution; and that the States were the depositary of most of the\r\npowers of government. The other party took upon itself the name of\r\nFederal, or Federalist, which had proved so valuable in the struggle over\r\nthe Constitution. Among its most eminent members were Hamilton, John Jay,\r\nVice-President John Adams, and President Washington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Newspaper organs.]\r\n\r\nBoth parties now began to set in motion new political machinery. The\r\n\"Gazette of the United States\" became the recognized mouthpiece of the\r\nFederalists, and the \"National Gazette,\" edited by Philip Freneau,\r\ntranslating clerk in Jefferson's department, began to attack Hamilton and\r\nother leading Federalists, and even the President. At a cabinet meeting\r\nWashington complained that \"that rascal Freneau sent him three copies of\r\nhis paper every day, as though he thought he would become a distributer of\r\nthem. He could see in this nothing but an impudent design to insult him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n83. WAR BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND (1793).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Revolution.]\r\n[Sidenote: War.]\r\n\r\nSo far the parties had been little more than personal followings; the\r\nmighty movements in Europe were now to crystallize them. Early in 1789 a\r\nrevolution had come about in France; in 1791 a constitution was put in\r\nforce under which the king became a limited monarch; in 1792 war broke out\r\nbetween France and a Prussian-Austrian alliance. Disasters on the frontier\r\nwere followed by the overthrow of the monarchy, and in January, 1793,\r\nLouis the Sixteenth was executed. The anarchical movement, once begun,\r\nhurried on until the government of France fell into the hands of men\r\ncontrolled by the populace of Paris. On Feb. 3, 1793, the French Republic\r\ndeclared war against England: the issue was instantly accepted. As the two\r\npowers were unable conveniently to reach each other on land, great efforts\r\nwere made on both sides to fit out fleets. The colonies of each power were\r\nexposed to attack, and colonial trade was in danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interest of America.]\r\n\r\nFrom the first the sympathy of the United States had naturally been with\r\nFrance. The republic seemed due to American example; Jefferson was our\r\nminister at Paris in 1789, and saw his favorite principles of human\r\nliberty extending to Europe. The excesses of the Revolution, however,\r\nstartled the Federalists, who saw in them a sufficient proof that\r\nJefferson's \"people\" could not be trusted. The war brought up the question\r\nof the treaty of 1778 with France, by which the Americans bound themselves\r\nto guarantee the colonial possessions of France in case of defensive war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger to America.]\r\n\r\nFor the United States to enter the war as ally of either side meant to\r\nlose most of the advantages gained by the new Constitution: the Indians on\r\nthe frontier had opposed and defeated a large body of United States\r\ntroops; the revenue of the country derived from imports would cease as\r\nsoon as war was declared; American ships would be exposed to capture on\r\nevery sea. Trade with the West Indies, which proceeded irregularly and\r\nillegally, was now likely to be broken up altogether. The question was no\r\nlonger one of international law, but of American politics: the Democrats\r\nwere inclined to aid France, by war or by indirect aid,--such as we had\r\nreceived from France at the beginning of the Revolutionary War; the\r\nFederalists leaned toward England, because they wished English trade, and\r\nbecause they feared the spread of anarchical principles in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n84. AMERICAN NEUTRALITY (1793).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality proclamation.]\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 1793, the news of the outbreak of war was received at\r\nPhiladelphia. Washington at once summoned his cabinet for the most\r\nimportant discussion which it had yet held. Was the United States to\r\nconsider itself bound to enter the war and to defend the French West\r\nIndies against Great Britain? Should the President declare that the United\r\nStates stood neutral in this contest? The question was new. For the first\r\ntime in history there was an independent American power,--a nation so far\r\nremoved by distance and by interest from European conflicts that it might\r\nreasonably ask that it should not be drawn into the struggle. Hamilton was\r\ninclined to hold the treaties abrogated by the change of government in\r\nFrance; Jefferson insisted that they were binding; both agreed that the\r\nPresident ought to issue a proclamation announcing that the United States\r\nwould take no part on either side. The neutrality proclamation, issued\r\nApril 22, was therefore an announcement to the world that the United\r\nStates stood outside the European system, and might continue friendly\r\nrelations with both belligerent powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Genet's mission.]\r\n\r\nThis attitude was anything but what France had expected. On April 8 a\r\nFrench minister, Genet, landed in Charleston, armed with a quantity of\r\nblank commissions for privateers. He was a man twenty-eight years old,\r\nwhose diplomatic experience had culminated in the disruption of one of the\r\nweaker neighbors of France. He had no doubt that the sympathy of the\r\nAmerican people was with his country. He proposed, therefore, to act as\r\nthough he stood upon his own soil: men were enlisted; privateers were\r\ncommissioned; prizes were taken in American waters and brought into\r\nAmerican ports for condemnation. Genet advanced northward in a kind of\r\ntriumphal procession. Throughout the South and West, Democratic clubs were\r\norganized, modelled on the French Jacobin and other revolutionary clubs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Genet and Washington.]\r\n\r\nHe reached Philadelphia, to be confronted by the Neutrality Proclamation\r\nand by the firmness of the President. His privateers were checked. He does\r\nnot appear to have demanded of the United States a fulfilment of the\r\ntreaty of 1778, but he did ask for advance payment of money due to France,\r\nand for other favors. To his chagrin, Congress was not to meet until\r\nDecember, and he insisted in vain that there should be an extra session.\r\nIn July Genet proceeded to fit out a captured British vessel, the \"Little\r\nSarah,\" as a privateer; and, contrary to the remonstrances of the\r\ngovernment and his own implied promise, she was sent to sea. Encouraged by\r\nthis success, he determined to make a public appeal to the people to\r\noverride the President. His purpose was made known, and his career was at\r\nan end. When the United States asked for his recall, it was cheerfully\r\naccorded by the French government. In three months Genet had contrived to\r\noffend the principal officers of government and to insult the nation. The\r\ncurrent of feeling was thus set toward England.\r\n\r\n\r\n85. THE JAY TREATY (1794-1796).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American grievances.]\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral rights.]\r\n\r\nOnce more the English government neglected the favorable moment for\r\nsecuring the friendship of the United States. The grievances so much\r\nresented under the Confederation (§ 56) were continued: the Western posts\r\nwere still occupied by the British; American vessels still paid\r\nunreasonable duties in British ports; the West India trade was still\r\nwithheld. The war at once led to new aggressions. France and England\r\nthroughout sought to limit American commerce by capturing vessels for\r\nviolations of four disputed principles of international law. The first was\r\nthat provisions are \"contraband of war,\" and hence that American vessels\r\ncarrying breadstuffs, the principal export of the United States, were\r\nengaged in an unlawful trade: the United States insisted that only\r\nmilitary stores were \"contraband of war.\" The second limiting principle\r\nwas that, after notice of the blockade of a port, vessels bound to it\r\nmight be taken anywhere on the high seas: the United States held that the\r\nnotice had no validity unless there was an actual blockading force outside\r\nthe port. The third principle was the so-called \"Rule of 1756,\" that where\r\na European country forbade trade with its colonies in time of peace it\r\nshould not open it to neutrals in time of war: the United States denied\r\nthe right of Great Britain to interfere in their trade with the French and\r\nSpanish colonies. The fourth principle was that a ship might be captured\r\nif it had upon it goods which were the property of an enemy. The United\r\nStates asserted that \"Free ships make free goods,\" that a neutral vessel\r\nwas not subject to capture, no matter whose property she carried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aggressions on the United States.]\r\n[Sidenote: Impressment.]\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of war.]\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1793, the French ordered the capture of vessels loaded with\r\nprovisions, although expressly excepted by the treaty of 1778. On June 8\r\nthe British issued a similar order; and in November the rule of 1756 was\r\nagain put in force by the British government. Captures at once began by\r\nboth powers; but the British cruisers were more numerous, did more damage,\r\nand thus inclined public sentiment in the United States against England.\r\nThe pacific Jefferson now came forward as the defender of American\r\ninterests: Sept. 16, 1793, he sent to Congress a report in which he set\r\nforth the aggressions upon American commerce, and recommended a policy of\r\nretaliation. Meantime a new grievance had arisen, which was destined to be\r\na cause of the War of 1812. In time of war the commanders of British naval\r\nvessels were authorized to \"impress\" British seamen, even out of British\r\nmerchant vessels. The search of American merchantmen on the same errand at\r\nonce began, and was felt by the United States government to be humiliating\r\nto the national dignity. The whole country was outraged by the frequent\r\nseizure of native Americans, on the pretext that they were English born.\r\nPublic feeling rose until on March 26, 1794, a temporary embargo was laid,\r\nforbidding vessels to depart from American ports. On April 17, a motion\r\nwas introduced to cut off commercial intercourse with Great Britain. On\r\nApril 19, therefore, the President appointed John Jay, Chief Justice of\r\nthe United States, as a special envoy to make a last effort to adjust\r\nmatters in England. Nevertheless, the non-inter course bill passed the\r\nHouse, and was defeated only by Adams's casting vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jay's Treaty.]\r\n\r\nFortunately it was a time when communication with Europe was slow. Not\r\nuntil June did Jay reach England. A treaty was negotiated on November 19,\r\nbut was not received by Washington until after the adjournment of Congress\r\nin March, 1795. The treaty had indeed removed some old grievances: the\r\nposts were to be evacuated; commissions were to settle the northeast\r\nboundary, and to adjust the claims for the British debts; but Jay got no\r\nindemnity for the negroes carried away by the British in 1783. The\r\ncommercial clauses were far less favorable: the discriminating taxes\r\nagainst American shipping were at last withdrawn; but Jay was unable to\r\nsecure any suitable guarantee for neutral trade, and could obtain no\r\npromise to refrain from searching American merchantmen, or seizing\r\nEnglish-born sailors found thereon. Above all, the West India trade, which\r\nthe United States so much desired, was granted only with the proviso that\r\nit should be carried on in vessels of less than seventy tons burden. In\r\nreturn for these meagre concessions, granted only for twelve years, the\r\nUnited States agreed not to export to any part of the world \"molasses,\r\nsugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excitement in the United States.]\r\n\r\nA special session of the Senate was summoned in June, 1795. and with great\r\ndifficulty the necessary two-thirds majority was obtained. The twelfth\r\narticle, containing the West India and the export clauses, was\r\nparticularly objectionable, and the Senate struck it out. During the\r\nremainder of the year there was the fiercest popular opposition; the\r\ncommercial and ship-building interest felt that it had been betrayed; Jay\r\nwas burned in effigy; Hamilton was stoned at a public meeting; State\r\nlegislatures declared the treaty unconstitutional. Washington was attacked\r\nso fiercely that he said the language used \"could scarcely be applied to a\r\nNero, to a notorious defaulter, or even to a common pickpocket.\" When\r\nCongress met in 1795 an effort was made to prevent the necessary\r\nappropriations for carrying out the treaty. It was only the great personal\r\npopularity of Washington that saved the country from a repudiation of the\r\ntreaty and a war with England. Once in force, the treaty was found\r\nmoderately favorable. Our commerce increased, and captures were much\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n86. THE WHISKEY REBELLION (1794).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The excise unpopular.]\r\n[Sidenote: Outbreak.]\r\n\r\nDuring this year of excitement a serious outbreak had occurred in\r\nPennsylvania. Ever since the first Excise Act in 1791 (§ 76), there had\r\nbeen determined opposition to the collection of the whiskey tax. The\r\npeople of southwestern Pennsylvania were three hundred miles from tide-\r\nwater; and whiskey was the only commodity of considerable value, in small\r\nbulk, with which they could purchase goods. The tax, therefore, affected\r\nthe whole community. In 1792 the policy pursued at the beginning of the\r\nRevolution was brought into action: mobs and public meetings began to\r\nintimidate the tax-collectors. In 1794 the difficulties broke out afresh,\r\nand on July 17 the house of Inspector-General Neville was attacked by a\r\nband of armed men; one man was killed, and the house was burned. Great\r\npopular mass meetings followed, and a few days later the United States\r\nmail was robbed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression.]\r\n\r\nAs this violence was directed against the revenue laws, Hamilton made it\r\nhis special task to suppress it. On September 25 the President called out\r\nthe militia from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\r\nHamilton himself accompanied the troops, fifteen thousand in number; they\r\nmarched over the mountains, and reached the disaffected country at the end\r\nof October. The insurgents made no stand in the field, and the troops\r\nreturned, after making a few arrests.\r\n\r\nThe matter now went to the courts. Six persons were indicted for treason,\r\nof whom two, Vigol and Mitchell, were convicted. They were rough and\r\nignorant men, who had been led into the outbreak without understanding\r\ntheir own responsibility, and Washington pardoned them both. In July,\r\n1795, a general amnesty was proclaimed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the whole movement was to make it evident throughout the\r\nnation that the United States had at its disposal a military force\r\nsufficient to put down any ordinary insurrection. In his message on the\r\nsubject on Nov. 19, 1794, Washington alluded to \"combinations of men who\r\nhave disseminated suspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole\r\ngovernment.\" The Senate applied these words to \"self-created societies.\"\r\nThe allusion was to the Democratic clubs, founded in 1793 when Genet came\r\nto the country (§ 84), and still in existence. The effect of Washington's\r\ncriticism was to break down the societies and to check a movement which\r\nlooked toward resistance to all constituted government. The opposition\r\nwere compelled to take a less objectionable party name, and began to call\r\nthemselves Republicans.\r\n\r\n\r\n87. ELECTION OF JOHN ADAMS (1796).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Washington retires.]\r\n[Sidenote: Nominations.]\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 17, 1796, Washington, in a public address, announced that he\r\nshould not accept a re-election. The presidency had been irksome to\r\nWashington, and the personal attacks upon himself had grieved him; but he\r\nretired with the admiration and respect of the whole country. The\r\nselection of a successor at once became a party question. Jefferson, who\r\nhad resigned the office of Secretary of State at the end of 1793, was the\r\nnatural leader of the Republicans. John Adams, then Vice-President, had\r\nthe largest Federalist following; but Hamilton hoped, by an electoral\r\ntrick, to bring T. Pinckney, the candidate for Vice-President, in over his\r\nhead. Adams candidly expressed his opinion of this intrigue: \"That must be\r\na sordid people indeed, a people destitute of a sense of honor, equity,\r\nand character, that could submit to be governed and see hundreds of its\r\nmost meritorious public men governed by a Pinckney under an elective\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adams and Jefferson.]\r\n\r\nThe danger was not, however, from Pinckney, but from Jefferson. When the\r\nvotes were counted it was found that Adams had received the vote of the\r\nNorthern States, with Delaware and a part of Maryland; but that Jefferson\r\nhad received almost the whole vote of the South and of Pennsylvania. Adams\r\nbecame President by a vote of seventy-one, and Jefferson Vice-President by\r\na vote of sixty-eight. The two men had been associated in early years, and\r\nwere not unfriendly to each other. There was even a hint that Jefferson\r\nwas to be taken into the cabinet. As soon as the administration began, all\r\nconfidence between them was at an end. The same set of elections decided\r\nthe membership of Congress to serve from 1797 to 1799; the Senate remained\r\ndecidedly Federalist; in the House the balance of power was held by a few\r\nmoderate Republicans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adams's cabinet.]\r\n\r\nAdams considered himself the successor to the policy of Washington, and\r\ncommitted the serious mistake of taking over his predecessor's cabinet.\r\nHamilton retired in 1795; he had been replaced by his friend and admirer,\r\nOliver Wolcott; the Secretary of State was Timothy Pickering of\r\nPennsylvania: both these men looked upon Hamilton as their party chief.\r\nThe administration began, therefore, with divided counsels, and with\r\njealousy in the President's official household.\r\n\r\n\r\n88. BREACH WITH FRANCE (1795-1798).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's mission.]\r\n\r\nWhile the war-cloud with England was gathering and disappearing, new\r\ncomplications had arisen with France. The Jay treaty was received by that\r\npower as an insult, partly because it was favorable to her rival, partly\r\nbecause it removed the danger of war between England and the United\r\nStates. In 1795 the first period of the Revolution was over, and an\r\nefficient government was constituted, with an executive directory of five.\r\nJames Monroe, appointed minister to France, had begun his mission in\r\nSeptember, 1794, just after the fall of Robespierre; he appeared in the\r\nNational Convention, and the president of that body adjured him to \"let\r\nthis spectacle complete the annihilation of an impious coalition of\r\ntyrants.\" During Jay's negotiations he continued to assure the French of\r\nthe friendship of America, although the Directory speedily declared that\r\nJay's treaty had released France from the treaty of 1778. As Monroe made\r\nno effort to push the American claims for captured vessels, he was\r\nrecalled in disgrace in 1796, and C. C. Pinckney was appointed as his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pinckney rebuffed.]\r\n\r\nThree weeks after his inauguration Adams received a despatch from Pinckney\r\nannouncing that he had been treated as a suspected foreigner, and that\r\nofficial notice had been given that the Directory would not receive\r\nanother minister from the United States until the French grievances had\r\nbeen redressed. A special session of Congress was at once summoned, and\r\nthe President declared that \"the action of France ought to be repelled\r\nwith a decision which shall convince France and the world that we are not\r\na degraded people, humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of\r\ninferiority.\" Headstrong behavior on the President's part would have\r\nimmediately brought on war; but he had already made up his mind to send a\r\nspecial mission to France. In June, 1797, John Marshall and Elbridge\r\nGerry, a Republican, but a personal friend of the President, were sent out\r\nto join Pinckney in a final representation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: X. Y. Z. affair.]\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a year before news of the result was received. On April 2,\r\n1798, the President communicated the despatches revealing the so-called\r\n\"X. Y. Z. affair.\" It appeared that the envoys on reaching Paris, in\r\nOctober, 1797, had been denied an official interview, but that three\r\npersons, whose names were clouded under the initials X. Y. Z., had\r\napproached them with vague suggestions of loans and advances; these were\r\nfinally crystallized into a demand for fifty thousand pounds \"for the\r\npockets of the Directory.\" The despatch described one conversation.\r\n\"'Gentlemen,' said X., 'you do not speak to the point. It is money. It is\r\nexpected that you will offer money.' We said that we had spoken to that\r\npoint very explicitly, that we had given an answer. 'No,' he replied, 'you\r\nhave not. What is your answer?' We replied, 'It is No, no, no; not a\r\nsixpence.'\" The President concluded with a ringing paragraph which summed\r\nup the indignation of the American people at this insult. \"I will never\r\nsend another minister to France without assurances that he will be\r\nreceived, respected, and honored as the representative of a great, free,\r\npowerful, and independent nation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval war with France.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican opposition in Congress was overwhelmed and almost silenced.\r\nA succession of statutes in April, May, and June hurried on military and\r\nnaval preparations, and on July 7, 1798, American vessels of war were\r\nauthorized to attack French cruisers. On Feb. 9, 1799, the \"Constellation\"\r\ntook the French frigate \"Insurgente,\" and American cruisers and privateers\r\nhad the satisfaction of retaliating for the numerous captures of American\r\nvessels by preying on French commerce. Measures were taken to raise land\r\nforces; but here again the rift in the Federal party appeared. Washington\r\nwas made titular commander-in-chief. It was expected that operations would\r\nbe directed by the second in command, and Hamilton's friends insisted that\r\nhe should receive that appointment. With great reluctance Adams granted\r\nthe commission, the result of which was the resignation of Knox, who had\r\nbeen third on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS (1798).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Triumph of the Federalists.]\r\n[Sidenote: Alien Act.]\r\n\r\nFor the first and last time in his administration John Adams found himself\r\npopular. From all parts of the country addresses were sent to the\r\nPresident approving his patriotic stand. The moderate Republicans in the\r\nHouse were swept away by the current, and thus there was built up a\r\ncompact Federalist majority in both houses. It proceeded deliberately to\r\ndestroy its own party. The newspapers had now reached an extraordinary\r\ndegree of violence; attacks upon the Federalists, and particularly upon\r\nAdams, were numerous, and keenly felt. Many of the journalists were\r\nforeigners, Englishmen and Frenchmen. To the excited imagination of the\r\nFederalists, these men seemed leagued with France in an attempt to destroy\r\nthe liberties of the country; to get rid of the most violent of these\r\nwriters, and at the same time to punish American-born editors who too\r\nfreely criticised the administration, seemed to them essential. This\r\npurpose they proposed to carry out by a series of measures known as the\r\nAlien and Sedition Acts. A naturalization law, requiring fourteen years\r\nresidence, was hurried through. On April 25 a Federalist introduced a\r\ntemporary Alien Act, for the removal of \"such aliens born, not entitled by\r\nthe constitution and laws to the rights of citizenship, as may be\r\ndangerous to its peace and safety.\" The opposition, headed by Albert\r\nGallatin, made a strong appeal against legislation so unnecessary,\r\nsweeping, and severe. The Federalists replied in panic fear: \"Without such\r\nan act,\" said one member, \"an army might be imported, and could be\r\nexcluded only after a trial.\" To the details of the bill there was even\r\ngreater objection. It conferred upon the President the power to order the\r\nwithdrawal of any alien; if he refused to go, he might be imprisoned at\r\nthe President's discretion, Nevertheless, the act, limited to two years,\r\nwas passed on June 25, 1798. Adams seems to have had little interest in\r\nit, and never made use of the powers thus conferred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sedition Act.]\r\n[Sidenote: Sedition prosecutions.]\r\n\r\nThe Sedition Act was resisted with even greater stubbornness. It proposed\r\nto punish persons who should conspire to oppose measures of the\r\ngovernment, or to intimidate any office-holder. The publishing of libels\r\nupon the government, or either house, or the President, was likewise made\r\na crime. Against this proposition there were abundant arguments, on\r\ngrounds both of constitutionality and expediency. It introduced the new\r\nprinciple of law that the United States should undertake the regulation of\r\nthe press, which up to this time had been left solely to the States. That\r\nits main purpose was to silence the Republican journalists is plain from\r\nthe argument of a leading Federalist: the \"Aurora,\" a Republican organ,\r\nhad said that \"there is more safety and liberty to be found in\r\nConstantinople than in Philadelphia;\" and the \"Timepiece\" had said of\r\nAdams that \"to tears and execrations he added derision and contempt.\" It\r\nis impossible to agree with the member who quoted these extracts that\r\n\"they are indeed terrible. They are calculated to freeze the blood in the\r\nveins.\" The Sedition Act was to expire in 1801. It was quickly put into\r\noperation, and one of the prosecutions was against Callender, known to be\r\na friend of Jefferson; he was indicted and convicted for asserting among\r\nother things that \"Mr. Adams has only completed the scene of ignominy\r\nwhich Mr. Washington began.\" So far from silencing the ribald journalists,\r\nthe Act and its execution simply drew down worse criticism. On the other\r\nhand, the Federalist press, which had been hardly inferior in violence,\r\nwas permitted to thunder unchecked. The Alien and Sedition Acts were party\r\nmeasures, passed for party purposes; they did not accomplish the purposes\r\nintended, and they did the party irreparable harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n90. VIRGINIA AND KENTUCKY RESOLUTIONS (1798-1800).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of disunion.]\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's and Jefferson's resolutions.]\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1798 in the excited state of public feeling assured a\r\nFederalist majority in the Congress to sit from 1799 to 1801. The\r\nRepublicans felt that their adversaries were using the power of the\r\nfederal government to destroy the rights of the people. June 1, 1798,\r\nJefferson wrote to a friend who thought that the time was come to withdraw\r\nfrom the Union; \"If on the temporary superiority of one party the other is\r\nto resort to a scission of the Union, no federal government can exist.\"\r\nThe remedy which lay in his mind was an appeal to the people through the\r\nState legislatures. In November and December, 1798, two series of\r\nresolutions were introduced,--one in the Virginia legislature, the other\r\nin the Kentucky legislature; the first drawn by Madison, and the second by\r\nJefferson's own hand. They set forth that the Constitution was a compact\r\nto which the States were parties, and that \"each party has an equal right\r\nto judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of\r\nredress.\" The Alien and Sedition Acts and some other statutes were\r\ndeclared by Kentucky \"not law ... void and of no effect;\" and the other\r\nStates were called upon to unite in so declaring them void, and in\r\nprotesting to Congress. For the first time since the Constitution had been\r\nformed, a clear statement of the \"compact\" theory of government was now\r\nput forth. It was a reasonable implication from these resolutions that if\r\nthe Federalist majority continued to override the Constitution, the States\r\nmust take more decisive action; but the only distinct suggestion of an\r\nattack on the Union is found in a second series of Kentucky resolutions,\r\npassed in 1799, in which it is declared that \"nullification ... of all\r\nunauthorized acts ... is the rightful remedy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purpose of the resolutions.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional doctrine in these resolutions was secondary. The real\r\npurpose was to arouse the public to the dangerous character of the\r\nFederalist legislation. Madison, many years afterward, explained that he\r\nmeant only an appeal to the other States to unite in deprecation of the\r\nmeasures. The immediate effect was to set up a sort of political platform,\r\nabout which the opponents of the Federalists might rally, and by the\r\npresentation of a definite issue to keep up the Republican organization\r\nagainst the electoral year 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n91. ELECTION OF 1800-1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace with France.]\r\n[Sidenote: Breach in the party.]\r\n\r\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts had quickly destroyed all Adams's popularity\r\nin the Republican party; his later action deprived him of the united\r\nsupport of the Federalists. War with France was pleasing to them as an\r\nassertion of national dignity, as a protest against the growth of\r\ndangerous democracy in France, and as a step toward friendship or eventual\r\nalliance with England. Early in 1799 Talleyrand intimated that a minister\r\nwould now be received from the American government. Without consulting his\r\ncabinet, with whom Adams was not on good terms, the President appointed an\r\nembassy to France. Early in 1800 they made a favorable treaty with France:\r\nbetter guarantees were secured for American neutral trade; the old\r\ntreaties of 1778 were practically set aside; and the claims of American\r\nmerchants for captures since 1793 were abandoned, This last action gave\r\nrise to the French Spoliation Claims, which remained unsettled for nearly\r\na century thereafter, Adams's determination to make peace was\r\nstatesmanlike and patriotic, but it gave bitter offence to the warlike\r\nFederalists. In May, 1800, Adams found his cabinet so out of sympathy that\r\nhe removed Pickering, Secretary of State, and appointed John Marshall.\r\nThis meant a formal breach between the Adams and the Hamilton wings of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Republicans successful.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1800 thus began with the Federalists divided, and the\r\nRepublicans hopeful. Hamilton was determined to force Adams from the\r\nheadship, and prepared a pamphlet, for which materials were furnished by\r\nOliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury. Aaron Burr, a wily Republican\r\nleader, managed to get a copy, published it, and spread it broadcast.\r\nAdams was re-nominated by a caucus of Federalist members, and C. C.\r\nPinckney was put on the ticket with him. Jefferson was, as in 1796, the\r\ncandidate of his party for President. For Vice-President there was\r\nassociated with him Burr, who was able to control the important vote of\r\nthe State of New York. The result of this coalition was seen in May, 1800,\r\nwhen a New York legislature was elected with a Republican majority; and\r\nthat legislature would, in the autumn, cast the vote of the State. The\r\nFederalists persevered, but South Carolina deserted them, so that both\r\nJefferson and Burr received seventy-three votes, and Adams had only sixty-\r\nfive. The Federalist supremacy was broken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election by the House.]\r\n\r\nNow arose an unexpected complication. There being a tie between Jefferson\r\nand Burr, the House of Representatives was called upon to decide between\r\nthem, its vote being cast by States. Had the majority of the House been\r\nRepublican, Jefferson would, of course, have received their votes; it was,\r\nhowever, Federalist, and the Federalists thought themselves entitled to\r\nchoose that one of their enemies who was least likely to do them harm.\r\nObscure intrigues were entered upon both with Jefferson and Burr. Neither\r\nwould make definite promises, although Burr held out hopes of alliance\r\nwith the Federalists. Hamilton now came forward with a letter in which he\r\ndeclared that of the two men Jefferson was less dangerous. \"To my mind,\"\r\nsaid he, \"a true estimate of Mr. Jefferson's character warrants the\r\nexpectation of a temporizing rather than of a violent system.\" After a\r\nlong struggle the deadlock was broken; Jefferson was chosen President of\r\nthe United States, and Burr Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. CAUSES OF THE FALL OF THE FEDERALISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unpopularity of the Federalists.]\r\n[Sidenote: Judiciary Act.]\r\n\r\nThe electoral majority was small; the Federalists preserved their\r\norganization, and had the prestige of twelve years of administration; it\r\nwas impossible to realize that there never again would be a Federalist\r\npresident. In the election of 1804, however, they received but fourteen\r\nelectoral votes altogether (§ 100). The reasons for this downfall are\r\nmany, However popular the French war had been, the taxes made necessary by\r\nit had provoked great dissatisfaction; and in 1799 a little insurrection,\r\nthe so-called Fries Rebellion, had broken out in Pennsylvania. The\r\nSedition prosecutions were exceedingly unpopular, The last acts of the\r\nparty left a violent resentment. In 1801, after it was known that there\r\nwould be a Republican President with a large majority in both houses of\r\nCongress, the Federalists resolved to bolster up their power in the third\r\ndepartment of government. A Judiciary Act was therefore passed, creating\r\nnew courts, new judges, and new salaried officials. All the resulting\r\nappointments were made by Adams, and duly confirmed by the Senate, thus\r\nanticipating by many years any real needs of the country. A vacancy\r\noccurring in the chief-justiceship, Adams appointed John Marshall, one of\r\nthe few Virginia Federalists; he had made his reputation as a politician\r\nand statesman: even Adams himself scarcely foresaw that he was to be the\r\ngreatest of American jurists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Internal dissensions.]\r\n\r\nStill more fatal were the internal dissensions in the party. In 1799\r\nWashington died, and no man in the country possessed his moderating\r\ninfluence, The cabinet, by adhering to Hamilton and corresponding with him\r\nupon important public matters, had weakened the dignity of the President\r\nand of the party. In the election of 1800 Hamilton, besides his open\r\nattack on Adams, had again tried to reduce his vote sufficiently to bring\r\nPinckney in over his head. Adams himself, although a man of strong\r\nnational spirit, was in some respects too moderate for his party. Yet his\r\nown vanity and vehemence made him unfit to be a party leader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Republican theories.]\r\n\r\nWhile these reasons may account for the defeat of the Federalists, they do\r\nnot explain their failure to rise again. They had governed well: they had\r\nbuilt up the credit of the country; they had taken a dignified and\r\neffective stand against the aggressions both of England and of France. Yet\r\ntheir theory was of a government by leaders. Jefferson, on the other hand,\r\nrepresented the rising spirit of democracy. It was not his protest against\r\nthe over-government of the Federalists that made him popular, it was his\r\nassertion that the people at large were the best depositaries of power.\r\nJefferson had taken hold of the \"great wheel going uphill.\" He had behind\r\nhim the mighty force of the popular will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN SUPREMACY (1801-1806).\r\n\r\n\r\n93.

THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION OF 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Jefferson.]\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the Federalists the success of the Republicans, and\r\nparticularly the elevation of Jefferson, meant a complete change in the\r\ngovernment which they had been laboring to establish. Jefferson was to\r\nthem the type of dangerous liberality in thought, in religion, and in\r\ngovernment. In his tastes and his habits, his reading and investigation,\r\nJefferson was half a century in advance of his contemporaries. Books and\r\nletters from learned men constantly came to him from Europe; he\r\nexperimented in agriculture and science. Accused during his lifetime of\r\nbeing an atheist, he felt the attraction of religion, and, in fact, was\r\nnot far removed from the beliefs held by the Unitarian branch of the\r\nCongregational Church in New England. Brought up in an atmosphere of\r\naristocracy, in the midst of slaves and inferior white men, his political\r\nplatform was confidence in human nature, and objection to privilege in\r\nevery form. Although a poor speaker, and rather shunning than seeking\r\nsociety, he had such influence over those about him that no President has\r\never so dominated the two Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's faults.]\r\n\r\nJefferson's great defect was a mistaken view of human nature: this showed\r\nitself in an unfortunate judgment of men, which led him to include among\r\nhis friends worthless adventurers like Callender. As a student and a\r\nphilosopher, he believed that mankind is moved by simple motives, in which\r\nself-interest is predominant: hence his disinclination to use force\r\nagainst insurrections; the people, if left to themselves, would, he\r\nbelieved, return to reason. Hence, also, his confidence in a policy of\r\ncommercial restriction against foreign countries which ignored our neutral\r\nrights; this was set forth in his commercial report of 1793 (§ 85), and\r\nlater was the foundation of his disastrous embargo policy (§ 103). He had\r\nentire confidence in his own judgment and statesmanship; his policy was\r\nhis own, and was little affected by his advisers; and he ventured to\r\nmeasure himself in diplomacy against the two greatest men of his time,--\r\nWilliam Pitt the younger and Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moderate policy.]\r\n\r\nFortunately his administration began at a period when general peace seemed\r\napproaching. The treaty of Amiens in 1802 made a sort of armistice between\r\nFrance and Great Britain, and neutral commerce was relieved from capture.\r\nThe national income was steadily rising (§ 52), the Indians were quiet,\r\nthe land dispute with Georgia--the last of the long series--was on the\r\npoint of being settled, the States showed no sign of insubordination. In\r\nhis inaugural address the new President took pains to reassure his fellow-\r\ncitizens. \"We have called by different names brethren of the same\r\nprinciple,\" said he; \"we are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\"\r\nAmong the essential principles of government which he enumerated, appeared\r\n\"absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority,--the vital\r\nprinciple of republics,--from which is no appeal but to force, the vital\r\nprinciple and immediate parent of despotism.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purpose to win the Federalists.]\r\n\r\nThe studied moderation of this address shows clearly the policy which\r\nJefferson had in his mind. In a letter written about this time he says:\r\n\"To restore that harmony which our predecessors so wickedly made it their\r\nobject to break, to render us again one people, acting as one nation,...\r\nshould be the object of every man really a patriot.\" Jefferson was\r\ndetermined to show the Federalists that there would be no violent change\r\nin his administration; he hoped thus to detach a part of their number so\r\nas to build up the Republican party in the Northern States. Even in\r\nforming his cabinet he avoided violent shocks; for some months he retained\r\ntwo members of Adams's cabinet; his Secretary of State was Madison, who in\r\n1789 was as much inclined to Federalism as to Republicanism; and he\r\nshortly appointed as his Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, the\r\nParliamentary leader of the party, but in financial principles and policy\r\nmuch like Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n95. JEFFERSON'S CIVIL SERVICE (1801-1803).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's principles.]\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks the disposition to conciliate was severely tried by the\r\npressure of applicants for office. Jefferson's principles on this subject\r\nwere summed up in a letter written March 24, 1801: \"I will expunge the\r\neffects of Mr. A.'s indecent conduct in crowding nominations after he knew\r\nthey were not for himself.... Some removals must be made for\r\nmisconduct.... Of the thousands of officers, therefore, in the United\r\nStates a very few individuals only, probably not twenty, will be removed:\r\nand these only for doing what they ought not to have done.\" Gallatin\r\nheartily supported him in this policy of moderation. Jefferson then laid\r\ndown the additional principle that he would fill all vacancies with\r\nRepublicans until the number of officeholders from each party was about\r\nequal. \"That done, I shall return with joy to that state of things when\r\nthe only questions concerning a candidate shall be, Is he honest? Is he\r\ncapable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political removals.]\r\n\r\nAdams was promptly rebuked by the removal of twenty-four persons appointed\r\nin the two months previous. Other removals were made for what would now be\r\ncalled \"offensive partisanship.\" Then came a third group of removals, in\r\norder, as Jefferson said, \"to make some room for some participation for\r\nthe Republicans.\" At the time he acknowledged that there had been sixteen\r\ncases,--in fact, there were many more; at the end of about two years after\r\nhis inauguration, out of 334 officers occupying important places, 178 were\r\nnew appointments, and of their predecessors at least 99 had been removed.\r\nThese officers in many cases carried with them a staff of subordinates. It\r\nis safe to say that one half the persons who had been in the civil service\r\nof the United States in March, 1801, were out of it in March, 1805.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointments.]\r\n\r\nNor did Jefferson adhere to his purpose to appoint Federalists and\r\nRepublicans indiscriminately after the balance should have been reached.\r\nHe appointed none but members of his own party; many Federalists in office\r\ncame over to the Republicans; and by 1809 the civil service was\r\npractically filled with Republicans.\r\n\r\n\r\n96. ATTACK ON THE JUDICIARY (1801-1805).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repeal of the Judiciary Act.]\r\n\r\nModeration in Jefferson's mind did not extend to the judiciary which had\r\nbeen forced upon the country by the Federalists in 1801. At his suggestion\r\nBreckenridge, in 1802, moved to repeal the recent Act, and thus to get rid\r\nat once of the new courts and of the incumbents. The Federalists protested\r\nthat the Constitution was being destroyed. \"I stand,\" said Gouverneur\r\nMorris, \"in the presence of Almighty God and of the world, and I declare\r\nto you that if you lose this charter, never, no, never, will you get\r\nanother. We are now, perhaps, arrived at the parting point.\" The repeal\r\nwas plainly intended to remove the last bulwark of the Federalist party in\r\nthe government. It was made more obnoxious by a clause suspending the\r\nsessions of the Supreme Court until February, 1803. It was passed by a\r\nmajority of one in the Senate, and by a party vote of fifty-nine to\r\nthirty-two in the House. The President signed it, and all the new circuit\r\njudges and judicial officers were thus struck from the roll of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impeachments.]\r\n[Sidenote: Marbury vs. Madison.]\r\n\r\nThe narrow majority in the Senate warned Jefferson not to proceed farther\r\nwith such statutes; but the judiciary could be affected in another way.\r\nSeveral of the supreme and district judges were ardent Federalists, and\r\nhad expressed strong political opinions from the bench. In February, 1803,\r\nthe House impeached John Pickering, district judge in New Hampshire; his\r\noffence was drunkenness and violence on the bench; but the purpose to\r\nintimidate the other judges was unmistakable. Two of them accepted the\r\nissue. The Supreme Court had resumed its session only a few days, when, in\r\n1803, Marshall made a decision in the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison.\r\nMarbury was one of Adams's \"midnight appointments;\" the suit was brought\r\nfor his commission, which had not been delivered, and was retained by\r\nMadison when he became Secretary of State. Marshall decided that \"to\r\nwithhold his commission is an act deemed by the court not warranted by\r\nlaw, but violative of a legal vested right.\" Upon a technical point,\r\nhowever, the complaint was dismissed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chase trial.]\r\n[Sidenote: Appointments.]\r\n\r\nFurther defiance came from another justice of the Supreme Court, Samuel\r\nChase of Maryland. His prejudice against Callender on his trial for\r\nsedition had exasperated the Republicans (§ 89), and on May 2, 1803, while\r\nthe Pickering impeachment was impending, Chase harangued the grand jury as\r\nfollows: \"The independence of the national judiciary is already shaken to\r\nits foundation, and the virtue of the people alone can restore it.... Our\r\nrepublican constitution will sink into a mobocracy,... the worst of all\r\npossible governments.\" Pickering was convicted March 12, 1804, and on the\r\nsame day the House impeached Chase. By this time the Republicans had\r\novershot the mark, and notwithstanding Chase's gross partisanship, on\r\nMarch 1, 1805, the impeachment failed for want of a two-thirds vote.  The\r\nonly hope of controlling the Supreme Court was therefore to fill\r\nvacancies, as they occurred, with sound Republicans. Three such\r\nopportunities occurred in Jefferson's administration. To his great\r\nchagrin, the new judges showed themselves as independent, though not as\r\naggressive, as Marshall.\r\n\r\n\r\n97. THE POLICY OF RETRENCHMENT (1801-1809).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Federal finance.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the effort to check the power of the judiciary failed, in another\r\ndirection Jefferson struck out a new and popular policy.  Under the\r\nFederalists the taxes had increased from $3,600,000 in 1792 to $10,700,000\r\nin 1800. This increase had been more than balanced by the growth of\r\nexpenditures. The Indian and French wars had brought unexpected expenses\r\nupon the government, and the construction of a little navy was still going\r\non, In 1793 the government spent $3,800,000. In 1800 it spent $10,800,000.\r\nOf this amount $6,000,000 went for the army and navy, and $3,000,000 for\r\ninterest. The deficits had been obscured by a funding system under which\r\npayments to the sinking fund were practically made out of borrowed money,\r\nso that the debt had risen from $80,000,000 in 1793 to nearly $83,000,000,\r\nin 1800.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gallatin's finance.]\r\n\r\nIf peace could be guaranteed, a considerable part of the expenditure could\r\nbe cut down; and thus taxes might be reduced, and still a surplus be left,\r\nout of which to pay instalments on the public debt. In his first annual\r\nmessage the President accordingly advised the reduction of the military\r\nand naval forces, and also of the civil officers. Gallatin proceeded to\r\ndraw up a financial plan: the annual revenue was to be $10,800,000,\r\nmilitary expenses were to be cut down to $2,500,000, and the civil\r\nexpenses to about $1,000,000; the remainder, $7,300,000, was to be devoted\r\nto the reduction of the debt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of the system.]\r\n\r\nNeither part of this scheme worked precisely as had been expected. The\r\narmy indeed underwent what Jefferson called a \"chaste reformation;\" it was\r\ncut down from 4,000 to 2,500 men, to the great discontent of the officers.\r\nThe number of vessels in commission was reduced from about twenty-five to\r\nseven, and the construction of vessels on the stocks was stopped, so that\r\nin 1802 less than $1,000,000 was spent on the navy. Nevertheless, the\r\ncivil and miscellaneous expenses of the government grew steadily. Under\r\nthe Federalist administration, the total expenditures in time of peace,\r\nexclusive of interest, had never been more than $3,000,000; in 1802\r\nGallatin spent $3,700,000, and in 1809 $7,500,000. The debt was, however,\r\nrapidly diminished, and in 1809 stood at only $45,000,000; nearly half of\r\nthe interest charge was thus cut off, and for the first time the\r\ngovernment found itself with more money than it knew how to use. The taxes\r\nhad been reduced by a million and a half, by striking off the unpopular\r\ndirect tax and excise; the loss was more than met by an unexpected\r\nincrease in the revenue from customs, which in 1808 stood at $16,000,000,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drawbacks.]\r\n\r\nTo reach this result Jefferson and Gallatin deliberately neglected to make\r\nordinary preparations against attack; fortifications were abandoned,\r\nskilled officers dismissed, ships allowed to decay at the wharves or on\r\nthe stocks, and the accumulation of military material ceased. The only\r\noffset to this neglect was the creation of a military school at West Point\r\nin 1802, and the training gained by the naval wars against the Barbary\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n98. BARBARY WARS (1801-1806).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The navy.]\r\n\r\nThe Peace Establishment Act of March 3, 1801, authorized the President to\r\nsell all the vessels of the navy except thirteen frigates, of which only\r\nsix were to be kept in commission; and the number of naval officers was\r\nreduced from five hundred to two hundred. \"I shall really be chagrined,\"\r\nwrote Jefferson, \"if the water in the Eastern Branch will not admit our\r\nlaying up the whole seven there in time of peace, because they would be\r\nunder the immediate eye of the department, and would require but one set\r\nof plunderers to take care of them.\" Events were too much for Jefferson's\r\ngenial intention. Ever since the Middle Ages the petty Moorish powers on\r\nthe north coast of Africa had made piracy on the Mediterranean trade their\r\nprofession. In accordance with the custom of European nations, in 1787 the\r\nUnited States had bought a treaty of immunity with Morocco, and later with\r\nAlgiers, Tripoli, and Tunis. Every payment to one of these nests of\r\npirates incited the others to make increased demands. In May, 1800, the\r\nPasha of Tripoli wrote to the President of the United States: \"We could\r\nwish that these your expressions were followed by deeds, and not by empty\r\nwords.... If only flattering words are meant, without performance, every\r\none will act as he finds convenient.\" Receiving no satisfaction, he\r\ndeclared war upon the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pirates subdued.]\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Jefferson's administration was, therefore, to\r\ndespatch a squadron to blockade Tripoli, and in 1802 he was obliged to\r\nconsent to a declaration of war by the United States. The frigates were\r\nunsuitable, and in 1803 Congress resumed the hated Federalist policy of\r\nbuilding a navy. Four new vessels, of a small and handy type, were\r\nconstructed, and under Commodore Preble, Tripoli was compelled in 1805 to\r\nmake peace and to cease her depredations. The other Barbary powers were\r\ncowed by this exhibition of spirit, and for some years our commerce was\r\nundisturbed. The first result of the war was, therefore, that the corsairs\r\nwere humbled. A far greater advantage to the United States was the skill\r\nin naval warfare gained by the officers of the navy. Thenceforward it was\r\nimpossible to think of shutting the navy up in the Eastern Branch of the\r\nPotomac. Naval expenditures slowly increased, and seven years later the\r\ngood effect was seen in the War of 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n99. ANNEXATION OF LOUISIANA (1803).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's political principles.]\r\n\r\nJefferson came into power as a stickler for a limited government, confined\r\nchiefly to foreign and commercial affairs. He now entered upon the most\r\nbrilliant episode of his administration,--the annexation of Louisiana; and\r\nthat transaction was carried out and defended upon precisely the grounds\r\nof loose construction which he had so much contemned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon's colonial system.]\r\n\r\nIn 1763 France had two flourishing American colonies,--Louisiana and\r\nHayti, the western end of the island of San Domingo. The former province\r\nwas ceded to Spain (§ 18); the latter, the centre of the French colonial\r\nsystem, was nearly destroyed by a slave insurrection in 1791. When, in\r\n1800, Napoleon Bonaparte became First Consul and virtual dictator, he\r\nformed a brilliant scheme of reviving the French colonial empire. The\r\nfirst step was to recover Louisiana; the second was to make peace with\r\nEngland, so as to stop the naval war and release the French resources; the\r\nthird step was to occupy, first Hayti, and then Louisiana. The three plans\r\nwere pursued with characteristic rapidity. In October, 1800, the secret\r\ntreaty of San Ildefonso was negotiated, by which Spain agreed to return\r\nLouisiana to France, the condition being that Napoleon should create a\r\nkingdom of Etruria for the son-in-law of the king of Spain. In 1802 the\r\nPeace of Amiens was made with England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toussaint Louverture.]\r\n\r\nA combined French and Spanish squadron had already, October, 1801, carried\r\na great expedition to occupy the whole island of San Domingo, with secret\r\norders to re-establish slavery. Then came an unexpected check: the fleet\r\nand the army of ten thousand experienced French troops were unable to\r\nbreak down the resistance of Toussaint Louverture, a native black general\r\nwho aimed to be the Napoleon of the island. Toussaint was taken; but the\r\narmy was forced back into a few sea-ports, and almost swept away by\r\ndisease. The blacks were still masters of the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alarm of the United States.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to have been the occupation of Louisiana. By this time,\r\nApril, 1802, the news of the cession reached the United States, and drew\r\nfrom Jefferson a remarkable letter. \"The day that France takes possession\r\nof New Orleans,\" said he, \"fixes the sentence which is to restrain her\r\nforever within her low-water mark. From that moment we must marry\r\nourselves to the British fleet and nation.\" As though to justify this\r\noutburst of anti-Gallican zeal on the part of the old friend of France,\r\nthe Spanish Intendant of Louisiana, Oct. 16, 1802, withdrew the so-called\r\n\"right of deposit\" under which Americans on the upper Mississippi had been\r\nable to send goods to the sea and to receive return cargoes without the\r\npayment of Spanish duty. If the province were to pass to France with the\r\nMississippi closed, it seemed to Jefferson essential that we should obtain\r\nWest Florida, with the port of Mobile; and in January, 1803, James Monroe\r\nwas sent as special envoy to secure this cession.  [Sidenote: Louisiana\r\ntreaty.]\r\n\r\nThe day after he reached Paris, Livingston, the resident minister, had\r\nclosed a treaty for the cession, not of West Florida, but of all\r\nLouisiana. The inner history of this remarkable negotiation has been\r\nbrought to light by Henry Adams in his History of the Administration of\r\nJefferson. The check in San Domingo had dampened the colonial ardor of\r\nNapoleon; war was about to break out again with England; Napoleon's\r\nambition turned toward an European empire; and he lightly offered the\r\nprovince which had come to him so cheaply. Neither Livingston, Monroe, nor\r\nJefferson had thought it possible to acquire New Orleans; with 880,000\r\nsquare miles of other territory it was tossed into the lap of the United\r\nStates as the Sultan throws a purse of gold to a favorite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indefinite boundaries.]\r\n\r\nThe treaty, dated April 30, 1803, gave to the United States Louisiana,\r\n\"with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it\r\nhad when France possessed it.\" The two phrases, instead of explaining each\r\nother, were contradictory: Louisiana as it was when France possessed it\r\nhad included settlements as far east as the Perdido River; Louisiana in\r\nthe hands of Spain had extended only to the Iberville. The United States\r\nhad therefore annexed a province without knowing its boundaries. We are\r\nnow aware that Napoleon had issued orders to occupy the country on the\r\nnorth only as far as the Iberville, but on the south as far as the Rio\r\nGrande; at the time France refused to give any information on either\r\npoint. Hence the United States gave up the claim to Texas, in which there\r\nwas reason, and insisted on the title to West Florida, which was nowhere\r\nto be found in the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n100. FEDERAL SCHEMES OF DISUNION (1803-1809).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anger of the Federalists.]\r\n[Sidenote: Arguments for annexation.]\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Louisiana aroused a storm in both hemispheres. The\r\nSpanish government vehemently protested, the more because the promised\r\nkingdom of Etruria proved to be but a mock principality. In the United\r\nStates the Federalists attacked both the annexation and the method of\r\nannexation with equal violence. The treaty promised that the people should\r\nas soon as possible be admitted as a State into the Union; the balance of\r\npower in the government was thus disturbed, and the Federalists foresaw\r\nthat the influence of New England must diminish. Their constitutional\r\narguments were just such as had been heard from the Republican writers and\r\nlegislatures in 1798: the constitution, they said, nowhere gives express\r\npower to annex territory, and therefore there is no such power; the Union\r\nis a partnership, and new members cannot be admitted except by unanimous\r\nconsent. The Republicans furnished themselves with arguments drawn from\r\nthe Federal arsenal: the right to annex territory, they said could be\r\nimplied from the power to make treaties, from the power to regulate\r\nterritory, and from the \"necessary and proper\" clause. Jefferson was not\r\nso ready to give up his cherished principles, and proposed a\r\nconstitutional amendment to approve and confirm the cession. His party\r\nfriends scouted the idea. The treaty was duly ratified, fifteen millions\r\nwere appropriated for the purchase, and on Dec. 20, 1803, possession of\r\nthe territory was given,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intrigues with Burr.]\r\n\r\nThe cup of the Federalists was now full, and a few violent spirits, of\r\nwhom Timothy Pickering was the leader, suggested that the time had come to\r\nwithdraw from the Union. They found no hearing among the party at large.\r\nIn 1804, therefore, they tried to form a combination with a wing of the\r\nNew York Republicans controlled by Burr, who had been read out of his\r\nparty by the Jeffersonian wing. He came forward as an independent\r\ncandidate for Governor, and asked for the support of the New York\r\nFederalists. Hamilton stood out against this movement, and wrote a letter\r\nurging his friends not to vote for him. Burr received the Federalist vote,\r\nbut was defeated, and in his humiliation sent Hamilton a challenge, and\r\nkilled him in the duel. The affair still further weakened the Federalists;\r\nin the national election of 1804 they cast but fourteen votes,--those of\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, and Maryland. Even Massachusetts voted for\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federalists weakened.]\r\n\r\nCommerce was still increasing; the Union was growing in extent and\r\nimportance; neither the interests nor the principles of the people had\r\nsuffered. The Federalist predictions of danger from Jefferson had not been\r\nfulfilled. There were still a few leaders who brooded over a plan of\r\nseparation; but the strength of the Federalists was now so broken that in\r\n1807 John Quincy Adams, son of the ex-President, and senator from\r\nMassachusetts, went over to the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\r\n101. THE BURR CONSPIRACY (1806-1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burr's schemes.]\r\n\r\nThe election of 1804 was the last attempt of Aaron Burr to re-enter public\r\nlife. His private character, already sufficiently notorious, had been\r\ndestroyed by the murder of Hamilton, and he was a desperate man. In 1805\r\nBurr went West, and was well received by many prominent men, including\r\nGeneral Wilkinson, the senior officer of the United States army, and\r\nAndrew Jackson, then a lawyer in Nashville, Tennessee. His purposes were\r\nvague: he planned the establishment of a colony on the new Western lands;\r\nhe had relations with certain Spanish adventurers who wished the\r\nindependence of Mexico; he hinted at securing the secession of the Western\r\nStates, with the aid of the British government. His chief purpose seems to\r\nhave been to head a revolution in the newly acquired Louisiana.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burr's expedition.]\r\n\r\nTo the rumors that Burr had some desperate and treasonable intention\r\nJefferson paid no attention. In December, 1806, Burr mustered a party of\r\nmen at Blennerhasset's Island, in the Ohio River, and with them floated\r\ndown the river. Twice attempts were made by local authorities to stop him\r\nand prosecute him, but he was allowed to continue, with about a hundred\r\nmen, till in January, 1807, while on the lower Mississippi, he learned\r\nfrom a newspaper that the President had issued a proclamation directing\r\nhis capture. He abandoned his men, and shortly afterwards fell into the\r\nhands of the authorities, and was sent to Washington for trial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wilkinson's treachery.]\r\n[Sidenote: Burr's Trial.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile steps had been taken to prevent the expected rising in\r\nLouisiana. Wilkinson was then on the extreme western frontier. He received\r\na cipher message from Burr, and after waiting for some hours to make up\r\nhis mind, concluded to betray him, sent the letters to the government,\r\nwent to New Orleans, and there arrested several of Burr's adherents, by\r\nmilitary authority. The danger to the Union had been slight, the laxity on\r\nJefferson's part unpardonable. Having Burr in his power, he now\r\nrelentlessly pursued him with a prosecution for treason. The trial was\r\nheld in Richmond, Chief Justice Marshall presiding, and ended on Sept. 1,\r\n1807. The indictment had set forth the mustering of the men at\r\nBlennerhasset's Island: since the only acts which could be called\r\ntreasonable had occurred elsewhere, the court declared the evidence\r\ninsufficient, and there was nothing for the jury to do but to bring him in\r\nnot guilty. The President had shown that he could use force, if necessary;\r\nand the courts had again shown their independence of the President. Burr\r\ndisappeared from public notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n102. AGGRESSIONS ON NEUTRAL TRADE (1803-1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American trade.]\r\n[Sidenote: Admiralty decisions.]\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the war between England and France in May, 1803, at first\r\nwas advantageous to the United States; it precipitated the cession of\r\nLouisiana and it gave new employment for American shipping. French West\r\nIndian products were freely imported, re-shipped, and exported, thus\r\navoiding the rule of 1756 (§ 85); as a result, the customs revenue leaped\r\nin one year from fourteen to twenty millions. In 1805 these favorable\r\nconditions were reversed. In May the British admiralty courts decided that\r\ngoods which had started from French colonies could be captured, even\r\nthough they had been landed and re-shipped in the United States. Captures\r\nat once began; English frigates were stationed outside the port of New\r\nYork, and vessels coming in and going out were insolently stopped and\r\nsearched; impressments were revived. In 1804 thirty-nine vessels had been\r\ncaptured by the British; in 1805 one hundred and sixteen were taken; and\r\nprobably a thousand American seamen were impressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental System.]\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 21, 1805, the combined French and Spanish fleets were overwhelmed\r\nat Trafalgar. Thenceforward England had the mastery of the seas, while\r\nFrance remained supreme on land. Napoleon, who had in 1804 taken the title\r\nof Emperor, was determined to destroy English trade with the Continent,\r\nand had no scruples against ruining neutrals in the attempt. He resolved\r\nupon a \"Continental System,\"--to shut against the importation of English\r\ngoods the ports of France and her dependencies and allies, including, as\r\nthe result of recent conquests, almost the whole northern coast of the\r\nMediterranean, and a considerable part of the coast of the German Ocean\r\nand the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orders and decrees.]\r\n\r\nThe English retaliated with an Order in Council, dated May 16, 1806, by\r\nwhich the whole coast from Brest to the river Elbe was declared blockaded.\r\nThere was no blockading squadron; yet American vessels were captured as\r\nthey left their own ports bound for places within the specified limit.\r\nNapoleon retorted with the Berlin Decree of Nov. 21, 1806, in which he\r\ndeclared the whole British Islands in a state of blockade; the trade in\r\nEnglish merchandise was forbidden, and no vessel that had touched at a\r\nBritish port could enter a French port. These measures were plainly\r\nintended to cut off the commerce of neutrals; and as the European wars had\r\nnow swept in almost every seafaring power, on one side or the other, the\r\nAmericans were the great neutral carriers. In January, 1807, Great Britain\r\nannounced that neutral vessels trading from one port under French\r\ninfluence to another were subject to capture, and that all French ports\r\nwere blockaded. The Milan Decree of December, 1807, completed the\r\nstructure of injustice by ordering the capture of all neutral vessels\r\nwhich had been searched by an English vessel. In 1806 the Jay Treaty\r\nexpired, and the Americans lost its slight protection. The effect of this\r\nwarfare of proclamations was at once seen in the great increase of\r\ncaptures: one hundred and ninety-four American vessels were taken by\r\nEngland in 1807, and a large number by the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n103. POLICY OF NON-RESISTANCE (1805-1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosperity of American trade.]\r\n\r\nThe wholesale seizure of American property was exasperating to the last\r\ndegree. The disdainful impressment of American seamen, and still more the\r\nunofficial blockade of the ports, would have justified war. Yet\r\nnotwithstanding the loss of American shipping, trade continued to prosper,\r\nand vessels engaged in foreign commerce increased; freights were so high\r\nthat an annual loss by capture of ten per cent could be made up out of the\r\nprofits. The New Englanders, therefore, who suffered most were not most\r\nanxious for war, nor could Jefferson bear to give up his policy of debt-\r\nreduction and of peaceful trade. Toward France, indeed, he showed\r\nremarkable tenderness, because that power controlled Spain, from which\r\nJefferson was eagerly seeking the cession of West Florida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gunboat system.]\r\n\r\nSome American policy must be formulated. War seemed to Jefferson\r\nunnecessary, and he therefore attempted three other remedies, which in a\r\nmeasure neutralized each other. The first was to provide some kind of\r\ndefence. To build new vessels seemed to him an invitation to the English\r\nnavy to swoop down and destroy them. To fortify the coasts and harbors\r\nproperly would cost fifty millions of dollars. He proposed, therefore, to\r\nlay up the navy and to build a fleet of gunboats, to be hauled up under\r\nsheds in time of peace, but if war came, to be manned by a naval militia\r\nand to repel the enemy. Between 1806 and 1812 one hundred and seventy-six\r\ngunboats were built. They never rendered any considerable service, and\r\ntook $1,700,000 out of Gallatin's surplus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pinkney treaty.]\r\n\r\nThe second part of Jefferson's policy was to negotiate with England for a\r\nnew treaty. The conditions upon which he insisted were impossible, and\r\nPinkney and Monroe, therefore, in December, 1806, made the best terms they\r\ncould: there was no article against impressment; they surrendered the\r\nprinciple that free ships make free goods; they practically accepted the\r\nrule of 1756. The treaty was so unacceptable that Jefferson never\r\nsubmitted it to the Senate; and thenceforward to the War of 1812 we had\r\nonly such commercial privileges as England chose to grant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-importation act.]\r\n\r\nThe only remaining arrow in Jefferson's quiver was the policy of\r\ncommercial restriction. On April 18, 1806, an act was Passed by which,\r\nafter November 15, the importation of manufactured goods from England and\r\nEnglish colonies was forbidden. Even this was suspended on December 29.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Leopard\" and \"Chesapeake.\"]\r\n[Sidenote: The Americans aroused.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of these feeble efforts to secure fair treatment was seen on\r\nJune 27, 1807. The only excuse for the impressment of American seamen was\r\nthat sailors from the British men-of-war were apt to desert when they\r\nreached an American port, and frequently shipped on board American\r\nvessels. The chief reason was the severity of naval discipline and the low\r\nwages paid by the British government. The American frigate \"Chesapeake,\"\r\nabout leaving Norfolk for a Mediterranean cruise, had several such\r\ndeserters on board without the commander's knowledge. When outside the\r\ncapes the British frigate \"Leopard\" suddenly bore down on her, hailed her,\r\nand her captain announced that he was about to search the ship for these\r\ndeserters. Commander Barron was taken by surprise; his guns were not ready\r\nfor action, his crew was not yet trained. He refused to permit the search,\r\nwas fired upon, and was obliged to surrender. Four men were taken off, of\r\nwhom three were American citizens, and the \"Chesapeake\" carried back the\r\nnews of this humiliation. The spirit of the nation was aflame. Had\r\nJefferson chosen, he might have gone to war upon this issue, and would\r\nhave had the country behind him. The extreme point which he reached was a\r\nproclamation warning British armed vessels out of American waters; he\r\npreferred a milder sort of warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n104. THE EMBARGO (1807-1808).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's recommendations.]\r\n\r\nThe Non-importation Act, which up to this time had had no force, finally\r\nwent into effect Dec. 14, 1807. Two days later news was received that the\r\nking had ordered British naval officers to exercise their assumed right of\r\nimpressment. Forthwith Jefferson sent a message to Congress, hinting that\r\nEngland was about to prohibit American commerce altogether, and\r\nrecommending an embargo so as to prevent the loss of our ships and seamen.\r\nThe Senate hurried a bill through all its stages in a single day; and the\r\nHouse, by nearly two to one, accepted it. No foreign merchant vessel could\r\nleave an American port, except in ballast, or with a cargo then on board;\r\nno American merchantman could leave for a foreign port on any terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The embargo evaded.]\r\n\r\nThe embargo was not really intended to save American shipping, for the\r\nowners were willing to run their own risks. The restriction was so new, so\r\nsweeping so little in accordance with the habits of the people, and so\r\ndestructive to the great interests of commerce that it was systematically\r\nevaded. Vessels left port on a coasting voyage, and slipped into a West\r\nIndian port, and perhaps returned with a West Indian cargo. Severe\r\nsupplementary acts were therefore necessary. A great trade sprang up\r\nacross the border into Canada, followed by new restrictions, with severe\r\npenalties and powers of search hitherto unknown in the law of the United\r\nStates. On Lake Champlain, on June 13, 1808, a band of sixty armed men\r\nfired upon United States troops, and carried a raft in triumph over the\r\nborder. A prosecution for treason against one of the men involved was a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No settlement with England.]\r\n\r\nThe expectation was that the President, backed up by the embargo, would\r\nnow succeed in a negotiation with England, that atonement would be made\r\nfor the \"Chesapeake\" outrage, and that a commercial treaty would at last\r\nbe gained. Mr. George Rose came over as British minister in December,\r\n1807; but he took the unfortunate attitude that the American government\r\nowed England an apology for action growing out of the \"Chesapeake\"\r\noutrage, and he returned in March without accomplishing anything: the two\r\ncountries remained in an attitude of hostility throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n105. REPEAL OF THE EMBARGO (1809).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect on England.]\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled in December, 1808, the effect of the embargo was\r\nmanifest. English merchants engaged in the American trade protested, and\r\nasked the British government to withdraw its Orders in Council. Lord\r\nCastlereagh declared that the embargo was \"operating at present more\r\nforcibly in our favor than any measure of hostility we could call forth,\r\nwithout war actually declared;\" English trade to the amount of $25,000,000\r\nwas, indeed, cut off; but notwithstanding this loss, the total exports of\r\nEngland increased. \"The embargo,\" says Henry Adams, \"served only to lower\r\nthe wages and the moral standard of the laboring classes throughout the\r\nBritish empire, and to prove their helplessness.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect on France.]\r\n\r\nThe reception of the embargo by France was even more humiliating. On April\r\n17, 1808, Napoleon issued a decree at Bayonne directing that all American\r\nvessels which might enter the ports of France, Italy, and the Hanse towns\r\nshould be seized, \"because no vessels of the United States can now\r\nnavigate the seas without infracting the law of the said States.\" \"The\r\nEmperor applauds the embargo,\" said the French foreign minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect on the United States.]\r\n\r\nIn America the embargo, which was intended to cut off the profits of\r\nforeign merchants and the provisions needed in foreign countries, had\r\ncrippled the shipping interests, had destroyed the export trade, and had\r\nalmost ruined the farmers. Exports dropped in one year from one hundred\r\nand ten millions to twenty-two millions; import duties were kept up during\r\n1808 by returning vessels, but in 1809 sank from sixteen millions to seven\r\nmillions; shipbuilding fell off by two-thirds; shipping in foreign trade\r\nlost 100,000 tons; wheat fell from two dollars to seventy-five cents a\r\nbushel. The South, from which the majority in favor of the embargo had\r\nbeen drawn, suffered most of all: tobacco could not be sold, and Virginia\r\nwas almost bankrupt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The embargo a failure.]\r\n[Sidenote: The embargo repealed.]\r\n\r\nThe money loss did not measure the injury to the country. New England\r\ningenuity was devoted to new methods of avoiding the law of the land, and\r\na passionate feeling of sectional injury sprang up. In the election of\r\n1808 the Federalists carried all New England except Vermont, and had a few\r\nSouthern votes; and the Republican majority in Congress was much cut down.\r\nThe embargo had plainly failed, and the only alternative seemed to be war.\r\nEven Jefferson was obliged to admit that the embargo must end a few months\r\nlater; \"But I have thought it right,\" he wrote, \"to take no part myself in\r\nproposing measures, the execution of which will devolve on my successor.\"\r\nIt became known that Madison, the President-elect, favored the repeal of\r\nthe embargo in June, and that Jefferson was only anxious that it should\r\nlast out his administration. The discontent of New England was so manifest\r\nthat a South Carolina member said: \"You have driven us from the embargo.\r\nThe excitement in the East renders it necessary that we should enforce the\r\nembargo with the bayonet, or repeal it. I will repeal it,--and I could\r\nweep over it more than over a lost child.\" On Feb. 2, 1809, the House, by\r\na vote of 70 to 40, decided upon immediate repeal. The only question now\r\nwas what policy should be substituted. On February 28 an agreement was\r\nreached: the embargo was replaced by a non-intercourse law which forbade\r\nBritish or French vessels to enter American ports; but there was no threat\r\nagainst the captors of American vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson humiliated.]\r\n\r\nThroughout his whole administration Jefferson had never before been\r\nconfronted with an offensive bill. He had been practically the leader in\r\nboth houses of Congress, and until this moment his followers had never\r\ndeserted him. He could not end his administration with a veto, and he\r\nsigned the act, although it was a tacit condemnation of his whole policy\r\nwith reference to neutral trade. The defence of the embargo was that it\r\nprevented war: but it had inflicted on the country the material losses and\r\nexcited the factional spirit which would have resulted from war; and the\r\ndanger of war was greater at the end than at the beginning of the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE UNION IN DANGER (1809-1815).\r\n\r\n\r\n106.

NON-INTERCOURSE LAWS (1809, 1810).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's administration.]\r\n\r\nJames Madison, who became President March 4, 1809, felt that his\r\nadministration was to be a continuation of that of Jefferson; and he took\r\nover three members of Jefferson's cabinet, including Gallatin. The\r\nSecretary of State, Robert Smith, was incapable, and Madison was\r\npractically his own foreign minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The situation abroad.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of European affairs was, on the whole, favorable to America.\r\nIn 1807 Russia had formed an alliance with France and had accepted the\r\nContinental System, thus cutting off American trade; but in 1808 the\r\nFrench lost ground in Spain, and the Spanish and Portuguese ports were\r\nthus opened to American commerce. Nevertheless a hundred and eight\r\nmerchantmen were captured by England in 1808.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-intercourse Act.]\r\n[Sidenote: Favorable trade.]\r\n\r\nTo defend American commerce and the national honor, the administration\r\npossessed but three weapons,--war, retaliatory legislation, and diplomacy.\r\nWar meant both danger and sacrifice; there was already a deficit in the\r\nTreasury. Congress, therefore, continued to legislate, while at the same\r\ntime attempts were made to negotiate with both France and England. The\r\nNon-intercourse Act continued in force throughout 1809, and hardly impeded\r\nAmerican commerce; trade with England and France went on through a few\r\nintermediary ports such as Lisbon and Riga, and there was a brisk direct\r\ntrade under special license of one or the other of the powers. The\r\nshipping engaged in foreign trade now reached a higher point than ever\r\nbefore. The profits of American vessels were so great that forged American\r\npapers were openly sold in England. The defection of New England was\r\nstayed, and the President was supported by a fair majority in both Houses.\r\nIt remained to be seen whether non-intercourse would have any effect in\r\nsecuring a withdrawal of the offensive orders and decrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n108. FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS (1809-1811).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Erskine treaty.]\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1809, Madison obtained what seemed a diplomatic triumph;\r\nErskine, the new British envoy, signed a formal agreement that the British\r\ngovernment should withdraw the Orders in Council. A proclamation was then\r\nissued, announcing that trade might be renewed with Great Britain. As\r\nFrance had from the first protested that her Decrees were simply\r\nretaliatory, it was expected that they would in due time also be annulled.\r\nThe satisfaction of the country was short-lived: Erskine had gone beyond\r\nhis instructions. Once more the opportunity to conciliate the United\r\nStates was thrown away by England; his agreement was formally disavowed;\r\nand on August 9 the President had the mortification of issuing a second\r\nproclamation, announcing that the Orders had not been withdrawn, and that\r\ntrade with England was still forbidden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's negotiation.]\r\n\r\nAnother British minister, James Jackson, was received October 1, and began\r\nhis negotiation by asserting that Madison had tricked Erskine into signing\r\nan agreement which the American government knew he was not authorized to\r\nmake. The charge was denied, and his relations were finally closed on\r\nNovember 8 by a note in which he was informed that inasmuch as he \"had\r\nused a language which cannot be understood but as reiterating and even\r\naggravating the same gross insinuation, no further communications will be\r\nreceived.\" Having thus practically been dismissed for brutally insulting\r\nthe government to which he was accredited, Jackson made a tour of the\r\nEastern States, and was received with hospitality and enthusiasm by the\r\nleading New England Federalists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macon Bill No. 2.]\r\n[Sidenote: Anger of France.]\r\n[Sidenote: Pretended revocation by France.]\r\n\r\nFrom France no satisfaction could be obtained during 1809. To remove all\r\nrestrictions on commerce was to give up everything; but Congress was tired\r\nof resistance, and on May i, 1810, passed the \"Macon Bill No. 2,\" which\r\nwas practically a surrender of all the principles at stake. It provided\r\nthat commerce should be free, but that if either England or France should\r\nwithdraw her Orders or Decrees, intercourse should be prohibited with the\r\nnation which retained them. The probable effect on France was speedily\r\nseen by the publication of a Decree which had been issued March 23, 1810:\r\nit declared that all American vessels which had entered French ports after\r\nthe date of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 were to be seized. This was\r\npractically an act of war. The Macon bill now suggested to the Emperor\r\nthat the Americans might be entrapped into another ambush: on August 5 his\r\nforeign minister wrote to Armstrong, the American minister, that \"the\r\nEmperor loves the Americans,\" and that he would revoke the Milan and\r\nBerlin Decrees from November 1, provided England would withdraw her Orders\r\nin Council. Five days earlier the secret Decree of the Trianon had ordered\r\nthe seizure of all American vessels that might reach French ports. The\r\nobject of these measures was to entice American vessels within the reach\r\nof the French, and the ruse was successful. November 1 the President\r\nissued a proclamation declaring trade with England suspended because\r\nFrance had withdrawn her Decrees. Then ensued a long diplomatic\r\ndiscussion: since captures of American vessels by French cruisers\r\ncontinued, the British government refused to admit that the Decrees had\r\nbeen withdrawn, and complained of the prohibition of English trade. On\r\nDecember 25 Napoleon drew in his net by a general order for the seizure of\r\nall American vessels in French ports; and property to the value of about\r\nten million dollars was thus confiscated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fruitless negotiation with England.]\r\n\r\nThe British ministry kept its promise to Jackson, not to recall him till\r\nthe end of a year. In February, 1811, Pinkney, our minister in London,\r\ndemanded his passports, and left England with a tacit threat of war. The\r\nBritish government instantly sent a fourth minister, Mr. Foster, to the\r\nUnited States, and on June 13, 1811, reparation was made for the \"Leopard-\r\nChesapeake\" outrage. This tardy act was received with coldness: four weeks\r\nearlier the English corvette \"Little Belt\" had fired upon the American\r\nfrigate \"President;\" the fire was returned, and the \"Little Belt\"\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n\r\n109. THE WAR PARTY (1811).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's first Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for peace or war was now thrown upon the Congress which\r\nassembled Nov. 4, 1811. It had been elected at a time when it was believed\r\nthat France had at last withdrawn the Decrees, and it had a strong\r\nRepublican majority in both branches; there were but six Federalists in\r\nthe Senate, and thirty-seven in the House. Even Massachusetts had chosen a\r\nRepublican senator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young Republicans.]\r\n\r\nThe new Congress had little of the timid spirit of its predecessor. It\r\ncontained an unusual number of vigorous young men. Among the members who\r\nappeared for the first time in the House were John C. Calhoun, Langdon\r\nCheves, and William Lowndes; two years later Daniel Webster took his seat.\r\nThe first act of the new House Was to elect as its Speaker Henry Clay of\r\nKentucky,--a young man for the first time a member of the House, and known\r\nto be in favor of war. His selection meant a change of counsels; the\r\ncommittees were reorganized, and Calhoun was made a leading member of the\r\ncommittee on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the West.]\r\n\r\nFor the first time since 1807 war seemed likely. The controlling element\r\nin Congress had no longer the traditions of the Revolutionary War and the\r\ninfluence of Revolutionary statesmen. Many of these members represented\r\ninterior States, having no sea-coast, and subject to no danger from\r\ninvasion. These States were too new to command the affectionate support of\r\ntheir people; to their members the United States government represented\r\nthe power and dignity of America; they chafed under the humiliations which\r\nhad so long been suffered. The growth of the South and West enabled\r\nCongress to override the Federalists of New England and the peace\r\nRepublicans of the Middle States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's attitude.]\r\n\r\nThe President was a peaceful man, but he was unable to manage Congress,\r\nand was weary of the long series of offensive measures against his\r\ncountry. The annual message bore a distinctly warlike tone, especially\r\ntoward England; and Gallatin suggested increased import duties and new war\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who was the enemy?]\r\n\r\nThe grievances of the United States were heavy, but to go to war was\r\ndifficult. The government was hampered by the fact that the New England\r\nship-owners, in whose behalf the government was negotiating and\r\nthreatening, preferred an irregular and hazardous trade to war. A more\r\nserious difficulty was that France had notoriously been a worse enemy than\r\nEngland; she had done all the open injury in her power, and had then\r\ntreacherously entrapped our vessels. Madison had taken the untenable\r\nground that our trade was respected by France, and that the British\r\ngovernment was therefore bound to withdraw its Orders. The New England\r\nFederalists had a corresponding partisan friendship for England, and could\r\nsee no offence in the blockade of our coasts, or even in impressment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Designs on Canada.]\r\n\r\nYet the war spirit against England was steadily rising. The reason is to\r\nbe found in a speech delivered by Henry Clay some months later: \"An\r\nhonorable peace is obtainable only by an efficient war. My plan would be\r\nto call out the ample resources of the country, give them a judicious\r\ndirection, prosecute the war with the utmost vigor, strike wherever we can\r\nreach the enemy at sea or on land, and negotiate the terms of peace at\r\nQuebec or Halifax.\" The immediate object of the war was, therefore, not to\r\nsecure the rights of vessel-owners: war would instantly make all American\r\ncommerce subject to capture; the evident purpose was to take Canada, and\r\nby the occupation of British territory to force England to make a\r\nfavorable peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminaries of war.]\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 6, 1812, a bill for raising twenty-five thousand troops was\r\npassed, and fifty thousand volunteers were authorized. The enthusiasm of\r\nCongress was chilled by new action of the French government, which proved\r\nits friendliness by capturing American merchantmen wherever found upon the\r\nsea. Nevertheless, on April 1 the President recommended an embargo, which\r\nwas understood to be preliminary to war with England. As the time for\r\nPresidential nominations came on, the New York Republicans bolted, and\r\nnominated De Witt Clinton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War declared.]\r\n\r\nStill the war was delayed. Although on May 19 news was received that the\r\nBritish government would not yield the Orders in Council, it was June 1\r\nbefore Madison sent to Congress a message recommending war, and not until\r\nJune 18 did the declaration pass. Nearly forty Republican members refused\r\nto vote for it, and the test vote was seventy-nine to forty-nine in the\r\nHouse, and nineteen to thirteen in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of the war.]\r\n\r\nThe causes of the war, as set forth in the messages of the President and\r\nin contemporary speeches, were four. The first was that the British had\r\ntampered with the Indians and urged them to hostilities: it was true, and\r\nit was trying; but the breaking out of war simply aggravated that\r\ndifficulty. The second charge was the interference with neutral trade by\r\nthe Orders in Council; but the injury from the French Decrees had been\r\nmore humiliating. The third complaint was perhaps the most serious and\r\nexasperating: it was the virtual blockade of American ports by British\r\ncruisers, and their interference with arriving and departing vessels.\r\nFinally came the impressment of American seamen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orders in Council withdrawn.]\r\n\r\nOf these grievances the last two had not up to this time been put forward\r\nas cause for war. On June 16, two days before the declaration of war, the\r\nBritish government reluctantly withdrew the Orders in Council against\r\nwhich the United States had for six years protested. Before hostilities\r\nhad fairly begun, notice was sent to the American government: it insisted\r\non prosecuting the war, which was therefore undertaken ostensibly for the\r\nprotection of the coast and the prevention of impressments.\r\n\r\n\r\n110. STRENGTH OF THE COMBATANTS (1812).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Population.]\r\n[Sidenote: Financial resources.]\r\n\r\nIn every respect except in the numbers available for land operations the\r\nAmericans seemed inferior to the English. It was a war between a people of\r\neight millions and a people of nearly twenty millions. The United States\r\nhad been deceived by eleven years of great prosperity, and failed to see\r\nthat the revenues of the government rose almost entirely from import\r\nduties, which would be cut off by war; and Congress showed a decided\r\nunwillingness to supplement these with other taxes. In 1811 the customs\r\nproduced $13,000,000, in 1812 but $9,000,000; and the total revenue of the\r\ngovernment was less than $10,000,000. The war, once begun, cost about\r\n$30,000,000 a year. The government was therefore thrown back upon loans,\r\nand it borrowed $98,000,000 during the war. As the credit of the\r\ngovernment began to diminish, those loans were sold at prices much less\r\nthan their face, and the country was obliged to issue $37,000,000 of\r\nTreasury notes. Meanwhile, England was raising by taxation nearly\r\n£70,000,000 a year, and in 1815 was successfully carrying a debt of\r\n£860,000,000. The remnant of Republican prejudice against Federalist\r\nfinances was just sufficient to prevent the re-chartering of the United\r\nStates Bank in 1811. The country, therefore, entered on the war with\r\ninsufficient means, impaired credit, and a defective financial\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National spirit.]\r\n[Sidenote: Disloyal utterances.]\r\n\r\nIn national spirit, also, the United States was the weaker. The British\r\nhad for twenty years been carrying a popular war with France, in which\r\nthey had shown themselves far superior at sea, and had gained great\r\nmilitary experience. In the United States sectional spirit was more\r\nviolent than at any time since 1798. We now know that some of the leading\r\nFederalists were, up to the outbreak of the war, in confidential\r\ncommunication with British envoys. In 1809 and 1810 the Republican\r\ngovernor and legislature in Pennsylvania were opposing with military\r\nviolence the service of the writs of the United States District Court in\r\nthe Olmstead Case. The disaffection of the Federalists was publicly\r\nexpressed by Josiah Quincy, of Massachusetts, in a Speech in 1811 on the\r\nadmission of Louisiana: \"If this bill passes, it is my deliberate opinion\r\nthat it is virtually a dissolution of this Union; that it will free the\r\nStates from their moral obligation; and, as it will be the right of all,\r\nso it will be the duty of some, definitely to prepare for a separation,\r\namicably if they can, violently if they must.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two armies.]  Nor did the military and naval preparation of\r\nthe country make up for its political weakness. The regular army of the\r\nUnited States was composed of 6,700 men. The service was so unpopular that\r\ntwo proclamations were issued in 1812 promising pardons to deserters. The\r\nhighest number of officers and men in the regular army was during the war\r\nbut 34,000. The dependence of the government, therefore, for offensive\r\noperations was upon the State militia. The general officers were old\r\nRevolutionary soldiers or men who had seen no service; the military\r\norganization was defective; and the Secretary of War, Eustis, was\r\nincompetent. In this very year, 1812, the British regular troops under\r\nWellington were steadily beating back the French, who had been supposed to\r\nbe the best soldiers in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two navies.]\r\n\r\nIn naval affairs comparison between the two powers was almost impossible.\r\nThe American navy consisted of twelve vessels, the largest of which were\r\nthe three 44-gun frigates \"United States\", \"Constitution,\" and\r\n\"President\". The number of men was 4,000, with 1,500 marines. The British\r\nnavy was composed of eight hundred and thirty vessels, of which two\r\nhundred and thirty were larger than any of the American ships; they had\r\n150,000 seamen, and unlimited power of impressing sailors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The theatre of the war.]\r\n\r\nThe theatre of war was to be much the same as in the French and Indian war\r\n(§ 14). The lines stretched from Nova Scotia to the Great Lakes, but\r\nsettlement had extended so far westward that Detroit marked the flank of\r\nboth powers, and Lake Erie was included in the field of operations. Like\r\nBraddock in 1755 (§ 16), the Americans expected to roll the enemy's line\r\nup from west to east; and at the same time they meant to penetrate where\r\nLoudon and Abercrombie had attacked, through Lake Ontario and Lake\r\nChamplain. For harbor and coast defence they relied chiefly on the fleet\r\nof gunboats.\r\n\r\n\r\n111. WAR ON THE NORTHERN FRONTIER (1812, 1813).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1812.]\r\n\r\nFor the beginning of the campaign two expeditions were planned,--one\r\nacross the river from Detroit, the other across the Niagara from Buffalo.\r\nThe experience of the Revolution threw little light on the problem of\r\nconveying large bodies of men, with the necessary stores, across such\r\nstretches of wild country. General Hull, in command at Detroit, after a\r\nsingle effort to invade Canada, was forced back, and on Aug. 16, 1812, was\r\nbrought to a disgraceful capitulation. Fort Dearborn, now Chicago, and\r\nMackinac were captured at about the same time. In October and November two\r\nattempts were made to cross the Niagara into Canada. Owing to the\r\nincapacity of the commanders, Van Rensselaer and Smythe, six thousand\r\nAmerican troops were held in check, and smaller bodies of them defeated,\r\nby one thousand British. The military authorities in the centre waited for\r\nthe reduction of western Canada before attempting to advance northward to\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaign of 1813.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1813 was little more fortunate. The British, with their\r\nsavage allies, held Detroit; but a fresh-water navy had been constructed\r\nby both parties on Lake Erie, and the victory of Commodore Perry gave the\r\ncontrol of Lake Erie, and thus of Detroit, to the Americans. On the\r\nNiagara frontier the Americans were successful in occupying the British\r\nforts on the western side of the river, but could not penetrate the\r\ncountry. A northern expedition descended the St. Lawrence, but was obliged\r\nto retire into American territory without result; and in the last days of\r\nthe year the Niagara posts were again abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n112. NAVAL WARFARE (1812-1815).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first cruise.]\r\n[Sidenote: English cruisers captured.]\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, the purpose of the administration was to keep the\r\nvessels of the United States navy in Port for harbor and coast defence. An\r\norder was sent to New York authorizing a brief preliminary cruise, and\r\nwithin one hour Commodore Rodgers, with the frigates \"President\", and\r\n\"Congress\", the ship \"Hornet\" and brig \"Argus\", had got to sea. Within two\r\ndays the little squadron attacked the British frigate \"Belvidera,\" which\r\nhad made herself obnoxious by her blockade of American ports, but lost\r\nher. On August 19 the frigate \"Constitution\", Captain Hull, met the\r\nBritish frigate \"Guerriere\", renowned for its unauthorized search of\r\nAmerican vessels: in thirty minutes the \"Guerriere\" was taken; and the\r\n\"Constitution\" returned in triumph to Boston. The effects of this\r\nbrilliant victory were immediately felt: New England shared in it; British\r\nnaval prestige had received a damaging blow; and the Navy Department could\r\nno longer hope to keep the navy at home for police duty. Meantime the\r\nsloop-of-war \"Wasp\" had captured the British brig \"Frolic\" of equal force;\r\nand Decatur, in the frigate \"United States\", on October 25 took the\r\nBritish frigate \"Macedonian\". A few weeks later the frigate\r\n\"Constitution\" captured the British frigate \"Java\".\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the victories.]\r\n\r\nThe result of six months naval warfare was the capture of three British\r\nfrigates and two smaller vessels, besides large numbers of merchantmen.\r\nAmerican commerce had been almost driven from the seas, but only three\r\nsmall American cruisers had been taken. The victories were more than\r\nunexpected, they were astounding In nearly every fight the American vessel\r\nwas of heavier tonnage, and threw a heavier broadside; but the sailors\r\nwere fighting the most renowned naval power in the world, The British\r\ncaptains in every case sought the encounter, and they were defeated by the\r\nsuperior tactical skill, and especially the superior gunnery, of the\r\nAmericans, Congress was obliged by the force of public sentiment to begin\r\nthe construction of new vessels. At the same time American privateers\r\nranged the seas and brought in British merchantmen. In 1813 there was a\r\nminor naval warfare on Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Champlain, Two small armed\r\nvessels, the \"Peacock\" and the \"Boxer,\" were captured at sea by the\r\nAmericans; and the ship \"Essex,\" under Captain Porter, ranged the Pacific\r\nand captured thirteen vessels,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The American navy subdued.]\r\n\r\nThe tide had now begun to turn, In June, 1813, Captain Lawrence, of the\r\nfrigate \"Chesapeake,\" was challenged by Captain Broke, of the \"Shannon,\"\r\nto fight him near the harbor of Boston. People assembled on Marblehead\r\nNeck to see the English cruiser made a prize; after a hard fight the\r\n\"Chesapeake\" was captured and towed into Halifax. It was the victory of\r\ndisciplined courage over courage less trained, and perhaps less well\r\nhandled. By this time large blockading squadrons had been sent out, and\r\nmost of the American fleet was shut up in the harbors of Boston, New\r\nLondon, and New York. The frigate \"President\" was captured while\r\nendeavoring to escape from New York; the \"Essex\" was taken in a neutral\r\nport; and for a time there was no American cruiser on the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American privateers.]\r\n\r\nThe defence of the newly acquired American reputation at sea was thus left\r\nto the privateers. They were small, handy vessels, apt at striking, and\r\nquick to run away. In 1813 they captured four hundred prizes, while the\r\nnational cruisers took but seventy-nine. The \"True-Blooded Yankee\" alone\r\nin thirty-seven days took twenty-seven vessels, some of them in Dublin\r\nBay, and was not captured. The loss of property and of prestige was so\r\ngreat that in 1814 insurance on vessels crossing the Irish Channel was\r\nrated at thirteen per cent. During two and a half years of war the\r\nprivateers took fourteen hundred prizes, and the cruisers took three\r\nhundred more. On the other hand, about seventeen hundred American\r\nmerchantmen had been captured by the British. The flag of the United\r\nStates on unarmed vessels had at the end of 1814 almost ceased to float on\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n113. DISASTROUS CAMPAIGN OF 1814.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The situation abroad.]\r\n\r\nNothing but a total want of understanding of the conditions in Europe\r\ncould have brought about the War of 1812. In 1811 the Continental System\r\n(§ 102) had broken down, because Russia would no longer cut off the trade\r\nin American ships. The result of this breach was Napoleon's Russian\r\ncampaign of 1812; his success would have totally excluded American\r\ncommerce from the Baltic, and would probably have resulted in the\r\noverthrow of England. The Americans were assisting the cause of a great\r\ntyranny and a great commercial monopoly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nDuring 1812 and 1813, while the Americans were vainly struggling to\r\ncapture a few petty forts on the Canadian frontier, Napoleon was falling\r\nback step by step; and on April 6, 1814, he abdicated his throne, and a\r\ngeneral European peace was made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lundy's Lane.]\r\n[Sidenote: English invasion.]\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Washington.]\r\n\r\nThe result was new energy in the American war. Twelve thousand English\r\nveteran troops were despatched to Canada, and expeditions were planned to\r\nharass the American coast. The struggle was renewed on the Niagara\r\nfrontier under the efficient command of Jacob Brown, a New York militia\r\ngeneral. An American force penetrated into Canada and fought the\r\nsuccessful battle of Lundy's Lane; but Brown was wounded, and his forces\r\nabandoned the field. The British now attempted to invade the United\r\nStates; the Maine coast was occupied, almost without resistance, as far\r\nsouth as the Penobscot; the Americans were attacked at Fort Erie, on the\r\nwest side of the Niagara; and a force of eighteen thousand men moved up\r\nLake Champlain to Plattsburg. On September 11 its advance was checked by a\r\nfield-work and an American fleet under Macdonough. Both at Fort Erie and\r\nat Plattsburg the veteran British troops were beaten off by the Americans\r\nbehind their breastworks. Meanwhile the nation had been overwhelmed with\r\nterror and shame by the capture of Washington. Five thousand British\r\ntroops landed from the Chesapeake, marched fifty miles across a populous\r\ncountry, and coolly took the national capital. The defence made by General\r\nWinder is characterized in his order to the artillery when, with seven\r\nthousand militia, he was about to make a stand: \"When you retreat, take\r\nnotice that you must retreat by the Georgetown road.\" The President and\r\ncabinet fled, and the public buildings were burned, in alleged retaliation\r\nfor destruction of buildings in Canada; and the assailing force withdrew\r\nto its ships without molestation. Encouraged by this success, a similar\r\nattack was made upon Baltimore; here a spirited resistance from behind\r\nintrenchments once more beat the British off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack on New Orleans.]\r\n\r\nNow came the news that an expedition was preparing to attack the Gulf\r\ncoast. Andrew Jackson, who had been engaged in Indian wars in the\r\nsouthwest, was put in command. Still, he made no preparation for the\r\ndefence of New Orleans, until, on December 10, the British expedition of\r\nfifty sail was sighted. Jackson now showed his native energy; troops were\r\nhurried forward, and militia were brought together. A want of common\r\nwatchfulness suffered the British to reach a point within seven miles of\r\nNew Orleans before they met any resistance. Then Jackson made such defence\r\nas he could. He formed an intrenched line with artillery; and here, with\r\nabout forty-five hundred men, he awaited the advance of eight thousand of\r\nthe British. They attacked him Jan. 8, 1815, and were repulsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n114. QUESTION OF THE MILITIA (1812-1814).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New England disaffected.]\r\n\r\nAs at New Orleans, so throughout the war, the greater part of the fighting\r\nwas done by State militia hastily assembled, imperfectly disciplined, and\r\nserving only for short terms. From the beginning, however, the New England\r\nStates had refused to furnish militia on the call of the general\r\ngovernment. They did not interfere with volunteer recruiting, and\r\nMassachusetts alone supplied as many troops as came from Virginia and\r\nNorth and South Carolina; but they declined officially to take part in\r\noffensive military operations. The war was very unpopular to the New\r\nEnglanders because of the great losses to their commerce, and because they\r\npaid more than half the expense; nor had New England any sympathy with\r\nthat invasion of Canada which was so popular in the West.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Militia refused.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as war broke out, the Secretary of War authorized General Dearborn\r\nto summon twenty thousand militia from the New England States. Care was\r\ntaken in sending the call to ask for small detachments of the militia, so\r\nas to rid the United States of the general militia officers appointed by\r\nthe States. The result of these combined causes was that the Governor of\r\nConnecticut refused to send militia, declaring that he must \"yield\r\nobedience to the paramount authority of the Constitution and the laws.\"\r\nThe Massachusetts House voted that the \"war is a wanton sacrifice of our\r\nbest interests;\" and the Governor of Massachusetts informed the President\r\nthat since there was no invasion, there was no constitutional reason for\r\nsending the militia. New Hampshire took similar ground, and the governor\r\nof Rhode Island congratulated the legislature on the possession of two\r\ncannon, with which that State might defend itself against an invader. On\r\nNov. 10, 1813, Governor Chittenden of Vermont ordered the recall of a\r\nbrigade which had been summoned outside the boundary of the State,\r\ndeclaring it to be his opinion that \"the military strength and resources\r\nof this State must be reserved for its own defence and protection\r\nexclusively.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National government hampered.]\r\n[Sidenote: New England attacked.]\r\n\r\nThe general government had no means of enforcing its construction of the\r\nConstitution. It did, however, withdraw garrisons from the New England\r\nforts, leaving those States to defend themselves; and refused to send them\r\ntheir quota of the arms which were distributed among the States. This\r\nattitude was so well understood that during the first few months of the\r\nwar English cruisers had orders not to capture vessels owned in New\r\nEngland. As the war advanced, these orders were withdrawn, and the\r\nterritory of Massachusetts in the District of Maine was invaded by British\r\ntroops. An urgent call for protection was then made upon the general\r\ngovernment; but even in this crisis Massachusetts would not permit her\r\nmilitia to pass under the control of national military officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n115. SECESSION MOVEMENT IN NEW ENGLAND (1814).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Federalist successes.]\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition to the war.]\r\n\r\nMore positive and more dangerous opposition had been urged in New England\r\nfrom the beginning of the war. Besides the sacrifice of men, Massachusetts\r\nfurnished more money for the war than Virginia. In the elections of 1812\r\nand 1813 the Federalists obtained control of every New England State\r\ngovernment, and secured most of the New England members of Congress. The\r\ntemper of this Federalist majority may be seen in a succession of\r\naddresses and speeches in the Massachusetts legislature. On June 15, 1813,\r\nJosiah Quincy offered a resolution that \"in a war like the present, waged\r\nwithout justifiable cause and prosecuted in a manner which indicates that\r\nconquest and ambition are its real motives, it is not becoming a moral and\r\nreligious people to express any approbation of military or naval exploits\r\nwhich are not immediately connected with the defence of our sea-coast and\r\nsoil.\" As the pressure of the war grew heavier, the tone in New England\r\ngrew sterner. On Feb. 18, 1814, a report was made to the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature containing a declaration taken almost literally from Madison's\r\nVirginia Resolution of 1798 (§ 90), that \"whenever the national compact is\r\nviolated, and the citizens of the State oppressed by cruel and\r\nunauthorized laws, this legislature is bound to interpose its power and\r\nwrest from the oppressor his victim.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impotence of Congress.]\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance threatened.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the British attacks in August and September, 1814, seemed\r\nto indicate the failure of the war. Congress met on September 19 to\r\nconfront the growing danger: but it refused to authorize a new levy of\r\ntroops; it refused to accept a proposition for a new United States Bank;\r\nit consented with reluctance to new taxes. The time seemed to have arrived\r\nwhen the protests of New England against the continuance of the war might\r\nbe made effective. The initiative was taken by Massachusetts, which, on\r\nOctober 16 voted to raise a million dollars to support a State army of ten\r\nthousand troops, and to ask the other New England States to meet in\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A convention called.]\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 15, 1814, delegates assembled at Hartford from Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Rhode Island, with unofficial representatives from New\r\nHampshire and Vermont. The head of the Massachusetts delegation was George\r\nCabot, who had been chosen because of his known opposition to the\r\nsecession of that State. As he said himself: \"We are going to keep you\r\nyoung hot-heads from getting into mischief.\" The expectation throughout\r\nthe country was that the Hartford convention would recommend secession,\r\nJefferson wrote: \"Some apprehend danger from the defection of\r\nMassachusetts. It is a disagreeable circumstance, but not a dangerous one.\r\nIf they become neutral, we are sufficient for one enemy without them; and,\r\nin fact, we get no aid from them now.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hartford Convention.]\r\n[Sidenote: Secession impending.]\r\n\r\nAfter a session of three weeks, the Hartford Convention adjourned, Jan.\r\n14, 1815, and published a formal report. They declared that the\r\nConstitution had been violated, and that \"States which have no common\r\numpire must be their own judges and execute their own decisions.\" They\r\nsubmitted a list of amendments to the Constitution intended to protect a\r\nminority of States from aggressions on the part of the majority. Finally\r\nthey submitted, as their ultimatum, that they should be allowed to retain\r\nthe proceeds of the national customs duties collected within their\r\nborders. Behind the whole document was the implied intention to withdraw\r\nfrom the Union if this demand were not complied with. To comply was to\r\ndeprive the United States of its financial power, and was virtually a\r\ndissolution of the constitution. The delegates who were sent to present\r\nthis powerful remonstrance to Congress were silenced by the news that\r\npeace had been declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n116. THE PEACE OF GHENT (1812-1814).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: Russian mediation.]\r\n[Sidebar: American commissioners sent.]\r\n\r\nThree months after the war broke out, the Russian government had offered\r\nmediation; it regretted to see the strength of the English allies wasted\r\nin a minor contest with America. Madison eagerly seized this opportunity,\r\nand on May 9, 1813, Gallatin and Bayard were sent as special\r\ncommissioners. On arriving in Russia they found that the British\r\ngovernment had refused the offer of mediation. The immediate effect was to\r\ntake Gallatin out of the Treasury, and he was followed by Secretary\r\nCampbell, to whose incompetence the financial impotence of the war is\r\npartly due. Toward the end of 1813 an offer of direct negotiation was made\r\nby the British government, and John Quincy Adams, Jonathan Russell, and\r\nHenry Clay were added to the negotiators. The absence of Clay, who had\r\nexercised such influence as Speaker of the House, accounts for the apathy\r\nof Congress in 1814.\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: The effect of European peace.]\r\n[Sidenote: Impressment.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until Aug. 8, 1814, that the commissioners finally met English\r\ncommissioners at Ghent. Of the grievances which had brought on the war,\r\nmost had been removed by the European peace: neutral vessels were no\r\nlonger captured; the blockade of American ports in time of peace was not\r\nlikely to be resumed; and the impressment of American seamen ceased\r\nbecause the English navy was reduced. The two countries were therefore\r\nfighting over dead questions. The Americans, however, naturally desired,\r\nin making peace, to secure a recognition of the principles for which they\r\nhad gone to war; and the British had now no other enemy, and were incensed\r\nat the temerity of the little nation which had attempted to invade Canada\r\nand had so humiliated England at sea.  Gradually, the commissioners began\r\nto find common ground. Gallatin reported to the home government that in\r\nhis judgment no article could be secured renouncing the right to impress\r\nBritish subjects wherever found. With a heavy heart, Madison consented\r\nthat that point should be omitted from the treaty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The war unpopular in England.]\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of American defence.]\r\n\r\nDuring 1814 great pressure was put upon the British government to make\r\npeace, on account of the loss inflicted by American privateers. The war\r\nwas costing England about ten million pounds sterling a year, and no\r\ndefinite result had been gained except the capture of a part of Maine and\r\nof the American post of Astoria in Oregon. The Americans were unable to\r\nmake headway in Canada; the English were equally unable to penetrate into\r\nthe United States. Wellington was consulted, and reported that in his\r\njudgment the British could hope for no success without naval superiority\r\non the lakes. The brave resistance of the Americans at Fort Erie and\r\nPlattsburg had won the respect of the great military commander. The\r\nministry, therefore, resolved upon peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Territory.]\r\n[Sidenote: Fisheries.]\r\n[Sidenote: The treaty signed.]\r\n\r\nThe first question to settle was that of territory. The British consented\r\nto restore the territory as it had been before the war; some attempt was\r\nmade to create a belt of frontier neutral territory for the Indians who\r\nhad been allies of the British, but that point was also abandoned.  Next\r\ncame the question of the fisheries: the British held that the American\r\nrights had been lost by the war; Clay insisted that the British right of\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi had also been forfeited, and that the\r\nfisheries might therefore be sacrificed as a \"matter of trifling moment.\"\r\nAdams stood out for the fisheries, and the result was that neither\r\nquestion was mentioned in the treaty. In 1818 a special convention was\r\nnegotiated, defining the fishery rights of the United States.  Upon these\r\ngeneral lines agreement was at last reached, and the treaty was signed\r\nDec. 24, 1814, several weeks before the battle of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n117. POLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE WAR (1815).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No gain from the war.]\r\n[Sidenote: National pride.]\r\n\r\nAfter nearly three years of war, the expenditure of one hundred millions\r\nof dollars, the loss of about thirty thousand lives, the destruction of\r\nproperty, and ruinous losses of American vessels, the country stood where\r\nit had stood in 1812, its boundary unchanged, its international rights\r\nstill undefined, the people still divided. Yet peace brought a kind of\r\nnational exaltation. The naval victories had been won by officers and men\r\nfrom all parts of the Union, and belonged to the nation. The last struggle\r\non land, the battle of New Orleans, was an American victory, and\r\nobliterated the memory of many defeats. President Madison, in his annual\r\nmessage of 1815, congratulated the country that the treaty \"terminated\r\nwith peculiar felicity a campaign signalized by the most brilliant\r\nsuccesses.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Training of soldiers.]\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy effect of the war had been the development of a body of\r\nexcellent young soldiers. Winfield Scott distinguished himself in the\r\nNiagara campaigns, and rose eventually to be the highest officer of the\r\nAmerican army. William Henry Harrison's military reputation was based\r\nchiefly on the Indian battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, but it made him\r\nPresident in 1840. Andrew Jackson's victory at New Orleans brought him\r\nbefore the people, and caused his choice as President in 1828. The\r\nnational pride was elated by the successes of American engineers, American\r\nnaval architects, American commodores, and volunteer officers like Jacob\r\nBrown, who had finally come to the front.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extrication from European politics.]\r\n\r\nThe end of the war marks also the withdrawal of the United States from the\r\ncomplications of European politics. From 1775 to 1815 the country had been\r\ncompelled, against its will, to take sides, to ask favors, and to suffer\r\nrebuffs abroad. During the long interval of European peace, from 1815 to\r\n1853, the United States grew up without knowing this influence.\r\nFurthermore, the field was now clear for a new organization of American\r\nindustries. The profits of the shipping trade had not been due so much to\r\nAmerican enterprise as to the greater safety of foreign cargoes in neutral\r\nbottoms. When this advantage was swept away, American shipping languished,\r\nand its place was taken by manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decay of the Federalist party.]\r\n[Sidenote: Persistence of Federalist principles.]\r\n[Sidenote: Gain in national spirit.]\r\n\r\nThe most marked result of the war was the absorption of the Federalist\r\nParty, which at once began, and in five or six years was complete. In the\r\nelection of 1812 eighty-nine votes had been cast for the Federalist\r\ncandidate (§ 109); in 1816 there were but thirty-four (§ 123); in 1820\r\nthere was not one. This did not mean that Federalist principles had\r\ndecayed or been overborne; the real reason for the extinction of that\r\nparty was that it lived in the ranks of the Republican party. When\r\nJefferson in 1801 said, \"We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists,\"\r\nhe expressed what had come to be true in 1815. The great principles for\r\nwhich the Federalists had striven were the right of the federal government\r\nto exercise adequate powers, and its duty to maintain the national\r\ndignity: those principles had been adopted by the Republicans.  John\r\nRandolph was almost the only leader who continued to stand by the\r\nRepublican doctrine enunciated by Jefferson when he became President.\r\nJefferson himself had not scrupled to annex Louisiana, to lay the embargo,\r\nand to enforce it with a severity such as Hamilton would hardly have\r\nventured on. Madison had twice received and used the power to discriminate\r\nbetween the commerce of England and of France; and during the war the\r\nnation had reimposed federal taxes and adopted Federalist principles of\r\ncoercion. James Monroe, Secretary of State at the end of Madison's\r\nadministration, and candidate for the Presidency in 1816, was in his\r\npolitical beliefs not to be distinguished from moderate Federalists like\r\nJames A. Bayard in 1800. The Union arose from the disasters of the War of\r\n1812 stronger than ever before, because the people had a larger national\r\ntradition and greater experience of national government, and because they\r\nhad accepted the conception of government which Washington and Hamilton\r\nhad sought to create.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REORGANIZATION (1815-1824).\r\n\r\n\r\n118.

CONDITIONS OF NATIONAL GROWTH (1815).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosperity.]\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States at the end of the war was about eight\r\nmillion five hundred thousand, and it was increasing relatively faster in\r\nthe South and West than near the seaboard. The return of peace seemed also\r\na return of prosperity. Short crops abroad revived the demand for American\r\ncereals, so that the surplus accumulated during the war could be sold at\r\nfair prices, and the exports in 1816 ran up to $64,000,000. In 1815,\r\nAmerican shipping recovered almost to the point which it had reached in\r\n1810. The revenue derived from taxation in 1814 was but $11,000,000; in\r\n1816 it was $47,000,000. More than twenty thousand immigrants arrived in\r\n1817. Wealth seemed increasing both in the North and the South.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National literature.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Clergy.]\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of the quickening of national life was the beginning of a\r\nnew national literature. In 1815 was founded the \"North American Review,\"\r\nand in an early number appeared Bryant's \"Thanatopsis.\" Already in 1809\r\nhad appeared the first work of an American which was comparable with that\r\nof the British essayists,--Washington Irving's \"Knickerbocker\" History of\r\nNew York. His quaint humor was not less appreciated from his good-natured\r\nallusions to the Jeffersonian principle of government \"by proclamation.\"\r\nThe hold of the clergy had been much weakened in New England; there had\r\nbeen a division of the Congregational Church, with the subsequent founding\r\nof the Unitarian branch; and the Jeffersonian principle of popular\r\ngovernment was gaining ground. The people were keen and alert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of transportation.]\r\n[Sidenote: Steamboats.]\r\n\r\nIn two respects the war had taught the Americans their own weakness: they\r\nhad had poor facilities for transportation, and they had lacked\r\nmanufactures of military material. There was a widespread feeling that the\r\nmeans of intercommunication ought to be improved. The troops on the\r\nnorthern frontier had been badly provisioned and slowly reinforced because\r\nthey could not readily be reached over the poor roads. A system had been\r\ninvented which was suitable for the rapid-running rivers of the interior\r\nand for lake navigation: in 1807 Fulton made the first voyage by steam on\r\nthe Hudson River. Nine years later a system of passenger service had been\r\ndeveloped in various directions from New York, and a steamer was running\r\non the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of manufactures.]\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign competition.]\r\n\r\nManufactures had sprung up suddenly and unexpectedly in the United States.\r\nThe restrictive legislation from 1806 to 1812, though it had not cut off\r\nforeign imports, had checked them; and shrewd ship-owners had in some\r\ncases diverted their accumulated capital to the building of factories. In\r\n1812 commerce with England was totally cut off, and importations from\r\nother countries were loaded down with double duties. This indirect\r\nprotection was enough to cause the rise of many manufactures, particularly\r\nof cotton and woollen goods. In 1815, the capital invested in these two\r\nbranches of industry was probably $50,000,000. On the conclusion of peace\r\nin England and America an accumulated stock of English goods poured forth,\r\nand the imports of the United States instantly rose from $12,000.000 in\r\n1814, to $106,000,000 in 1815. These importations were out of proportion\r\nto the exports and to the needs of the country, and they caused the\r\nstoppage of a large number of American factories. Meanwhile, American\r\nships had begun to feel the competition of foreign vessels in foreign\r\ntrade. Without intending it, the country had drifted into a new set of\r\neconomic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n120. THE SECOND UNITED STATES BANK (1816).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Banks and currency.]\r\n\r\nThe first evidence of this change of feeling was a demand for the renewal\r\nof the bank which had been allowed to expire in 1811 (§ 110). The country\r\nhad been thrown entirely upon banks chartered by the States; the pressure\r\nof the war had caused their suspension, and the currency and banking\r\ncapital of the United States had thus been thrown into complete confusion.\r\nFor example, the Farmers Exchange Bank of Gloucester, R. I., was started,\r\nwith a capital of $3,000; accumulated deposits so that one of the\r\ndirectors was able to steal $760,000; and then it failed, with specie\r\nassets of $86.46. In 1811 there were eighty-eight State banks; in 1816\r\nthere were two hundred and forty-six.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bank bill of 1814.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank Act.]\r\n\r\nSince the re-charter bill of 1811 had failed by only one vote, Dallas,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in 1814, again proposed a national bank.\r\nCongress accepted the principle, but an amendment proposed by John C.\r\nCalhoun so altered the scheme that upon Dallas's advice Madison cast his\r\nfirst important veto against it on Jan. 30, 1815. What Dallas desired was\r\na bank which would lend money to the government; what Congress planned was\r\na bank which would furnish a currency based on specie. In the next session\r\nof Congress Madison himself urged the creation of a bank, and this time\r\nCalhoun supported him. The Federalists, headed by Daniel Webster,--\r\nremnants of the party which had established the first national bank,--\r\nvoted against it on the general principle of factious opposition. A small\r\nminority of the Republicans joined them, but it was passed without much\r\ndifficulty, and became a law on April, 10, 1816.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bank charter.]\r\n\r\nThe bank was modelled on its predecessor (§ 78), but the capital was\r\nincreased from $10,000,000 to $35,000,000, of which the United States\r\ngovernment held $7,000,000. It was especially provided that \"the deposits\r\nof the money of the United States shall be made in said bank or branches\r\nthereof.\" In return for its special privileges the bank agreed to pay to\r\nthe government $1,500,000. The capital was larger than could safely be\r\nemployed; it was probably intended to absorb bank capital from the State\r\nbanks. The prosperity of the country, aided by the operations of the bank,\r\nsecured the renewal of specie payments by all the sound banks in the\r\ncountry on Feb. 20, 1817.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loose construction accepted.]\r\n\r\nThe striking feature in the bank was not that it should be established,\r\nbut that it should be accepted by old Republicans like Madison, who had\r\nfound the charter of a bank in 1791 a gross perversion of the\r\nConstitution. Even Henry Clay, who in 1811 had powerfully contributed to\r\nthe defeat of the bank, now came forward as its champion.\r\n\r\n\r\n121. INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS (1806-1817).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local improvements.]\r\n[Sidenote: Cumberland road.]\r\n[Sidenote: Gallatin's scheme.]\r\n\r\nSide by side with the bank bill went a proposition for an entirely new\r\napplication of the government funds. Up to this time internal\r\nimprovements--roads, canals and river and harbor improvements--had been\r\nmade by the States, so far as they were made at all. Virginia and Maryland\r\nhad spent considerable sums in an attempt to make the Potomac navigable,\r\nand a few canals had been constructed by private capital, sometimes aided\r\nby State credit. In 1806 the United States began the Cumberland Road, its\r\nfirst work of the kind; but it was intended to open up the public lands in\r\nOhio and the country west, and was nominally paid for out of the proceeds\r\nof those public lands. Just as the embargo policy was taking effect,\r\nGallatin, encouraged by the accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury,\r\nbrought in a report, April 4, 1808, suggesting the construction of a great\r\nsystem of internal improvements: it was to include coastwise canals across\r\nthe isthmuses of Cape Cod, New Jersey, upper Delaware and eastern North\r\nCarolina; roads were to be constructed from Maine to Georgia, and thence\r\nto New Orleans, and from Washington westward to Detroit and St. Louis. He\r\nestimated the cost at twenty millions, to be provided in ten annual\r\ninstalments. Jefferson himself was so carried away with this prospect of\r\npublic improvement that he recommended a constitutional amendment to\r\nauthorize such expenditures. The whole scheme disappeared when the surplus\r\nvanished; but from year to year small appropriations were made for the\r\nCumberland road, so that up to 1812 more than $200,000 had been expended\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calhoun's Bonus Bill.]\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's veto.]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the bank bill in 1816 was to give the United States a\r\nmillion and a half of dollars (Section 120). Calhoun, therefore, came\r\nforward, Dec. 23, 1816 with a bill proposing that this sum be employed as\r\na fund \"for constructing roads and canals and improving the navigation of\r\nwatercourses.\" \"We are\" said he, \"a rapidly--I was about to say a\r\nfearfully--growing country.... This is our pride and danger, our weakness\r\nand our strength.\" The constitutional question he settled with a phrase:\r\n\"If we are restricted in the use of our money to the enumerated powers, on\r\nwhat principle can the purchase of Louisiana be justified?\" The bill\r\npassed the House by eighty-six to eighty-four; it was strongly supported\r\nby New York members, because it was expected that the general government\r\nwould begin the construction of a canal from Albany to the Lakes; it had\r\nalso large support in the South, especially in South Carolina. In the last\r\nhours of his administration Madison vetoed it. His message shows that he\r\nhad selected this occasion to leave to the people a political testament;\r\nhe was at last alarmed by the progress of his own party, and, like\r\nJefferson, he insisted that internal improvements were desirable, but\r\nneeded a constitutional amendment. The immediate effect of the veto was\r\nthat New York, seeing no prospect of federal aid, at once herself began\r\nthe construction of the Erie Canal, which was opened eight years later.\r\n[Sidenote: State improvements.] Other States attempted like enterprises;\r\nbut the passes behind the Susquehanna and Potomac rivers were too high,\r\nand no permanent water way was ever finished over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n122. THE FIRST PROTECTIVE TARIFF (1816).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of duties.]\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's attitude.]\r\n\r\nThe protection controversy had hardly appeared in Congress since the\r\nmemorable debate of 1789 (Section 76). From time to time the duties had\r\nbeen slightly increased, and in 1799 a general administrative tariff act\r\nhad been passed. The wars with the Barbary powers had necessitated a\r\nslight increase of the duties, known as the Mediterranean Fund, and this\r\nhad been allowed to stand. Up to the doubling of the duties in 1812 the\r\naverage rate on staple imports was only from ten to fifteen per cent, and\r\nthe maximum was about thirty per cent. The whole theory of the Republican\r\nadministration had been that finance consisted in deciding upon the\r\nnecessary expenses of government, and then in providing the taxes\r\nnecessary to meet them. This theory had been disturbed by the existence of\r\na debt which Jefferson was eager to extinguish; and he therefore permitted\r\nthe duties to remain at a point where they produced much more than the\r\nordinary expenditure of the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The manufacturers.]\r\n[Sidenote: The West.]\r\n\r\nA change had now come over the country. The incidental protection afforded\r\nby the increase of duties, and then by the war, had built up manufactures,\r\nnot only in New England, but in New York and Pennsylvania. In these\r\nstrongholds of capital and trade there was a cry for higher duties, and it\r\nwas much enforced by the attitude of the Western members. There were a few\r\nstaple crops, particularly hemp and flax, which could not be produced in\r\nthe face of foreign competition, and for which Western States were\r\nsupposed to be adapted. Hence a double influence was at work in behalf of\r\na protective tariff: the established industries pleaded for a continuance\r\nof the high duties which had given them an opportunity to rise; and the\r\nfriends of young industries asked for new duties, in order that their\r\nenterprises might be established.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dallas's tariff bill.]\r\n[Sidenote: Opponents.]\r\n[Sidenote: Advocates.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in February, 1816, Secretary Dallas made an elaborate report\r\nin favor of protective duties. John Randolph, who still posed as the\r\ndefender of the original Republican doctrine, protested. \"The\r\nagriculturist,\" said he, \"has his property, his lands, his all, his\r\nhousehold gods to defend;\" and he pointed out what was afterward to become\r\nthe most effective argument against the tariff: \"Upon whom bears the duty\r\non coarse woollens and linens and blankets, upon salt and all the\r\nnecessaries of life? Upon poor men and upon slaveholders.\" Webster,\r\nrepresenting the commercial interest of New England, decidedly opposed the\r\ntariff, especially the minimum principle, and succeeded in obtaining a\r\nslight reduction. One of the strongest defenders of the tariff was\r\nCalhoun. Manufactures, he declared, produced an interest strictly\r\nAmerican, and calculated to bind the widespread republic more closely\r\ntogether. The chief supporter of the system was Henry Clay of Kentucky,\r\nthe Speaker of the House. His argument was that the country ought to be\r\nable to defend itself in time of war, It was not expected at this time\r\nthat a protective tariff would become permanent. In a few years, said a\r\ncommittee of the House, the country would be in a condition to bid\r\ndefiance to foreign competition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protective policy.]\r\n[Sidenote: The minimum.]\r\n\r\nThe act as passed April 27, 1816, had favorable votes in every State in\r\nthe Union except Delaware and North Carolina. The opposition was strong in\r\nthe South and in New England. Madison signed the bill and accepted the\r\npolicy, and even Jefferson declared that \"We must now place the\r\nmanufacturer by the side of the agriculturist.\" The act imposed duties of\r\ntwenty-five per cent upon cotton and woollen goods, and the highest ad\r\nvalorem duty was about thirty per cent. In addition, no duty was to be\r\nless than six and a quarter cents a yard on cottons and woollens: hence as\r\nimprovements in machinery caused a rapid lowering of the cost of\r\nproduction abroad, the duty grew heavier on coarse goods, in proportion to\r\ntheir value, till it was almost prohibitory. The act was accepted without\r\nany popular demonstrations against it, and remained in force, with some\r\nunimportant modifications, until 1824. One purpose undoubtedly was to show\r\nto foreign governments that the United States could discriminate against\r\ntheir trade if they discriminated against ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n123. MONROE'S ADMINISTRATION (1817-1825).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's election.]\r\n[Sidenote: The cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe election of 1816 proved that the Federalists could no longer keep up a\r\nnational organization. They were successful only in Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Delaware. On March 4, 1817, therefore, James Monroe took\r\nhis seat as the President of a well-united people. Although he had been\r\nthe friend and candidate of Randolph, he represented substantially the\r\nsame principles as Jefferson and Madison. His cabinet was the ablest since\r\nWashington's; he gathered about him four of the most distinguished public\r\nmen in the country. His Secretary of State was John Quincy Adams, one of\r\nthe negotiators of the treaty of Ghent. His Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nWilliam H. Crawford of Georgia, who had shown financial ability in\r\nCongress and in Madison's cabinet. For Secretary of War he chose John C.\r\nCalhoun, who had in the six years of his national public service become\r\nrenowned as an active and almost a passionate advocate of the use of large\r\nnational powers. His Attorney-General was William Wirt of Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Party strength.]\r\n\r\nThese young men represented an eager policy, and in their national\r\nprinciples had advanced far beyond the old Federalists; but the people had\r\nbeen somewhat startled by the boldness of the preceding Congress, and many\r\nof the members who would have agreed with the President had lost their\r\nseats. Throughout the whole administration Jefferson at Monticello, and\r\nMadison at Montpelier, remained in dignified retirement; from time to time\r\nMonroe asked their advice on great public questions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commercial treaties.]\r\n\r\nOne of the first tasks of the administration was to restore the commercial\r\nrelations which had been so disturbed by the Napoleonic wars. Algiers had\r\ntaken advantage of the War of 1812 to capture American vessels. In 1815\r\nthe Dey was compelled on the quarter-deck of Decatur's ship to sign a\r\ntreaty of peace and amity. All our commercial treaties had disappeared in\r\nthe war, and had to be painfully renewed. In 1815 a commercial convention\r\nwas made with Great Britain, and in 1818 the fishery privileges of the\r\nUnited States were reaffirmed. The West India trade was still denied, but\r\na retaliatory act brought Great Britain to terms, and it was opened in\r\n1822.\r\n\r\n\r\n124. TERRITORIAL EXTENSION (1805-1819).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northern boundary.]\r\n[Sidenote: Oregon.]\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary treaty.]\r\n\r\nThe administration inherited two serious boundary controversies, one with\r\nEngland, and another with Spain. Some progress had been made toward\r\nrunning the northeast boundary, till in 1818 the commissioners disagreed.\r\nThe northwest boundary had now come to be more important. A few months\r\nbefore the annexation of Louisiana, Jefferson had sent an expedition to\r\nexplore the country drained by the Columbia River, which had been\r\ndiscovered by a Boston ship in 1791. This expedition, under Lewis and\r\nClark, in 1805 reached tributaries of the Columbia and descended it to its\r\nmouth, anticipating a similar English expedition. Nevertheless, the\r\nHudson's Bay Company established trading-posts in the region. Monroe\r\nsettled the difficulty for the time being by a treaty with Great Britain\r\nin 1818, providing that the disputed region lying between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Pacific Ocean and extending indefinitely northward\r\nshould be jointly occupied by both countries. At the same time the\r\nnorthern boundary was defined from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: West Florida.]\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish treaty.]\r\n\r\nA year later another treaty with Spain gave to the United States a region\r\nwhich Jefferson had longed for in vain. Ever since 1803 the United States\r\nhad asserted that West Florida had come to it as a part of Louisiana (§\r\n99). Spain steadfastly refused to admit this construction or to sell the\r\nprovince. In 1810 Madison by proclamation took possession of the disputed\r\nregion, and a part of it was soon after added to Louisiana. East Florida\r\ncould not possibly be included within Louisiana, but as a detached\r\npeninsula it was of little value to Spain. John Quincy Adams now undertook\r\na negotiation for the settlement of all outstanding difficulties with\r\nSpain, and on Feb. 22, 1819, a treaty was signed: East Florida was ceded\r\nfor a payment of about $6,500,000, and at the same time the western\r\nboundary of Louisiana was settled. An irregular line was described from\r\nthe Gulf to the forty-second parallel; it was not far distant from the\r\nwatershed south and west of the tributaries of the Mississippi. Then came\r\nthe triumph of the whole negotiation: Adams obtained from Spain a\r\nrenunciation of all claims north of the forty-second parallel, as far west\r\nas the Pacific. Our hold upon Oregon was thus much strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n125. JUDICIAL DECISIONS (1812-1824).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New judges.]\r\n[Sidenote: Authority asserted.]\r\n\r\nTwo departments of the federal government had now shown their belief that\r\nthe United States was a nation which ought to exercise national powers How\r\ndid it stand with the judiciary department? Of the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt appointed by Washington and Adams but two remained in office in\r\n1817; but the new justices, as they were appointed, quietly accepted the\r\nconstitutional principles laid down by Marshall, their Chief Justice and\r\nleader. Among them was Joseph Story of Massachusetts, whose mastery of\r\nlegal reasoning and power of statement gave him unusual influence. After\r\nthe Marbury case in 1803 (§ 96) the Court refrained for some years from\r\ndelivering decisions which involved important political questions. In\r\n1809, however, it sustained Judge Peters of the Pennsylvania District\r\nCourt in a struggle for authority against the governor and legislature of\r\nthat State (§ 110). The courts were victorious, and the commander of the\r\nmilitia, who had opposed them with armed force, was punished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appeals taken.]\r\n[Implied powers affirmed.]\r\n\r\nThe legislation of 1815 and 1816 showed to the Court that its view of the\r\nConstitution was accepted by the people; and it now began a series of\r\ngreat constitutional decisions, which put on record as legal precedents\r\nthe doctrines of implied powers and of national sovereignty. In the great\r\ncases of Martin _vs._ Hunter's Lessee, and Cohens _vs._ Virginia, in 1816\r\nand 1821, it asserted the right of the Supreme Court to take cases on\r\nappeal from the State courts, and thus to make itself the final tribunal\r\nin constitutional questions. At about the same time, in two famous cases,\r\nMcCullough _vs._ Maryland in 1819, and Osborn et al. _vs._ Bank of the\r\nUnited States in 1824, the doctrine of implied powers was stated in the\r\nmost definite manner. Both cases arose out of the attempt of States to tax\r\nthe United States Bank, and the final issue was the power of Congress to\r\ncharter such a bank. The doctrine laid down by Hamilton in 1791 (§ 78) was\r\nreaffirmed in most positive terms. \"A national bank,\" said Marshall, \"is\r\nan appropriate means to carry out some of the implied powers, a usual and\r\nconvenient agent.... Let the end be within the scope of the Constitution,\r\nand all means which are ... plainly adapted to that end, which are not\r\nprohibited,... but consistent with the letter and spirit of the\r\nConstitution, are constitutional.\" Although the tariff act was not tested\r\nby a specific case, the spirit of the decision reached it also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State powers limited.]\r\n[Sidenote: Impairment of contracts.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus asserted the authority of the nation on one side, the Court\r\nproceeded to draw the boundary of the powers of the States on the other\r\nside. In a question arising out of grants of land by the Georgia\r\nlegislature in the Yazoo district, it had been claimed that any such grant\r\ncould be withdrawn by a subsequent legislature. The Court held in Fletcher\r\n_vs._ Peck, in 1810, that such a withdrawal was in contravention of\r\nthe constitutional clause which forbade the States to impair the\r\nobligation of contracts. In 1819, in the celebrated case of Dartmouth\r\nCollege _vs._ Woodward, this principle was pushed to an unexpected\r\nconclusion. The legislature of New Hampshire had passed an act modifying a\r\ncharter granted in colonial times to Dartmouth College. Webster, as\r\ncounsel for the Board of Trustees which had thus been dispossessed,\r\npleaded that a charter granted to a corporation was a contract which could\r\nnot be altered without its consent. Much indirect argument was brought to\r\nbear upon Marshall, and eventually the Court held that private charters\r\nwere contracts. The effect of this decision was to diminish the power and\r\nprestige of the State governments; but the general sentiment of the\r\ncountry sustained it. So united did all factions now seem in one theory of\r\nnational existence that in the election of 1820 Monroe received every vote\r\nbut one.\r\n\r\n\r\n126. THE SLAVERY QUESTION REVIVED (1815-1820).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silent growth of slavery.]\r\n\r\nOut of this peace and concord suddenly sprang up, as Jefferson said, \"like\r\na fire-bell in the night,\" a question which had silently divided the Union,\r\nand threatened to dissolve it. It was the question of slavery. During the\r\nwhole course of the Napoleonic wars the country had been occupied in the\r\ndefence of its neutral trade; since 1815 it had been busy in reorganizing\r\nits commercial and political system. During this time, however, four new\r\nStates had been admitted into the Union: of these, two--Ohio and Indiana--\r\ncame in with constitutions prohibiting slavery; two--Louisiana and\r\nMississippi--had slaves. This balance was not accidental; it was arranged\r\nso as to preserve a like balance in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery profitable.]\r\n[Sidenote: Slave-trade forbidden.]\r\n\r\nThe movement against slavery had by no means spent itself: there were\r\nstill emancipation societies both North and South. In 1794 Jay appeared to\r\nsuppose that cotton was not an American export (§ 85); but since the\r\ninvention of the cotton-gin in 1793 the cultivation of cotton by slave\r\nlabor had grown more and more profitable, and in 1820 that export was\r\nvalued at nearly twenty millions. The planters of the northern belt of\r\nslaveholding States did not share in this culture, but they found an\r\nincreasing sale for their surplus blacks to their Southern neighbors; they\r\nhad, therefore, joined with members from the Northern States in the act of\r\nMarch 2, 1807, to prohibit the importation of slaves. The act was\r\ninsufficient, inasmuch as the punishment provided was slight, and slaves\r\ncaptured while in course of illegal importation were sold for the benefit\r\nof the States into which they were brought, In 1820 the slave-trade was\r\nmade piracy, so that the nominal penalty was death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schemes of colonization.]\r\n\r\nOne evidence of the uneasiness of the country on the slavery question was\r\nthe formation of the American Colonization Society in 1816. Its purpose\r\nwas to encourage emancipation, and thus to reduce the evils of slavery, by\r\ndrawing off the free blacks and colonizing them in Africa. It had a large\r\nmembership throughout the country; James Madison and Henry Clay were among\r\nits presidents. Some States made grants of money in its aid, and after\r\n1819 the United States assisted it by sending to the African colony slaves\r\ncaptured while in course of illegal importation. The whole scheme was but\r\na palliative, and in fact rather tended to strengthen slavery, by taking\r\naway the disquieting presence of free blacks among the slaves. The\r\nSociety, however, never had the means to draw away enough negroes sensibly\r\nto affect the problem; the number which they exported was replaced many\r\ntimes over by illegal importations from Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fugitive slaves.]\r\n[Sidenote: District of Columbia.]\r\n\r\nIn two other directions the nation had power over slavery, but declined to\r\nexercise it The Fugitive Slave Act (Section 79) was found to be\r\nineffective. From 1818 to 1822 three bills to strengthen it were\r\nintroduced and strongly pressed, but nothing could be accomplished. In the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, where the United States had complete legislative\r\npower, slavery existed under a very harsh code. Washington was a centre\r\nfor the interstate slave-trade, and John Randolph, himself a slaveholder,\r\ncould not restrain his indignation that \"we should have here in the very\r\nstreets of our metropolis a depot for this nefarious traffic;\" but\r\nCongress took no action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Status of Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nA question had now arisen which must be decided. The whole of the\r\nLouisiana cession was slaveholding territory, and settlers had gone up the\r\nMississippi River and its western tributaries with their slaves. In 1819\r\nit was found necessary to provide a territorial government for Arkansas;\r\nand the people living about the Missouri River applied to be admitted as a\r\nState with a slaveholding constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. THE MISSOURI COMPROMISES (1818-1821),\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arkansas debate.]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the great slavery contest was a bill introduced into the\r\nHouse in December, 1818, providing a territorial government for Arkansas.\r\nTaylor of New York proposed that slavery be prohibited in the Territory;\r\nMcLane of Delaware suggested the \"fixing of a line on the west of the\r\nMississippi, north of which slavery should not be tolerated.\" The test\r\nvote on the exclusion of slavery was a tie, and Clay, as Speaker, cast his\r\nvote against it. The new Territory lay west of the Mississippi, and\r\nadjacent to Louisiana. The Northern members were, therefore, not disposed\r\nto make the issue at that point, and on March 2, 1819, an Act was passed\r\norganizing Arkansas, with no mention of slavery. Meanwhile, Illinois had\r\nbeen admitted, making eleven free States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proposed restriction on Missouri.]\r\n\r\nSide by side with this debate had proceeded a discussion on the admission\r\nof Missouri as a State. On Feb. 13, 1819, Talmadge of New York proposed as\r\nan amendment \"that the further introduction of slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude be prohibited, ... and that all children of slaves born within\r\nthe said State after the admission thereof into the Union shall be free.\"\r\nMissouri lay west of Illinois, which had just been admitted into the Union\r\nas a Free State; the Northern members, therefore, rallied, and passed the\r\nTalmadge amendment by a vote of eighty-seven to seventy-six. The Senate,\r\nby a vote of twenty-two to sixteen, refused to accept the amendment; there\r\nwas no time for an adjustment, and Congress adjourned without action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Missouri bill.]\r\n[Sidenote: Maine bill.]\r\n[Sidenote: Compromise line.]\r\n\r\nDuring 1819 the question was discussed throughout the Union. Several\r\nlegislatures, by unanimous votes, protested against admitting a new Slave\r\nState, and when the new Congress assembled in 1819 it became the principal\r\nissue of the session. Alabama was at once admitted, restoring the balance\r\nof Slave and Free States. The people of Maine were now about to separate\r\nfrom Massachusetts, and also petitioned for entrance into the Union. A\r\nbill for this purpose passed the House on December 30, and a month later a\r\nbill for the admission of Missouri, with the Talmadge amendment, was also\r\nintroduced into the House. The Senate, on Feb. 16, 1820, voted to admit\r\nMaine, provided Missouri was at the same time admitted as a Slave State.\r\nThe House still refused to comply. Thomas of Illinois now proposed as a\r\ncompromise the principle suggested by McLane a year earlier,--that an east\r\nand west line be drawn across the Louisiana cession, north of which\r\nslavery should be prohibited. Fourteen Northern members united with the\r\nseventy-six Southern members to form a bare majority against prohibiting\r\nslavery in Missouri; the principle was thus abandoned, and the only\r\nquestion was where the line should be drawn: the parallel of 36° 30' was\r\nselected, but it was expressly provided that Missouri should be\r\nslaveholding. On March 3 the compromise became a law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Missouri constitution.]\r\n\r\nA year later a third difficulty arose. The people of Missouri had formed a\r\nconstitution which provided that free colored men should not be allowed to\r\nenter the State under any pretext. Nearly the whole Northern vote in the\r\nHouse was cast against admitting the State with this provision. Clay\r\nbrought about a compromise by which the Missourians were to agree not to\r\ndeprive of his rights any citizen of another State. Upon this\r\nunderstanding Missouri was finally admitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friends of disunion.]\r\n[Sidenote: Advantage to the South.]\r\n[Sidenote: Advantage to the North.]\r\n\r\nIn form the compromises were a settlement of difficulties between the two\r\nHouses; in fact they were an agreement between the two sections, by which\r\nthe future of slavery in every part of the Louisiana purchase was to be\r\nsettled once for all. Threats were freely made that if slavery were\r\nprohibited in Missouri, the South would withdraw. Calhoun told Adams that\r\nif the trouble produced a dissolution of the Union, \"the South would be\r\nfrom necessity compelled to form an alliance, offensive and defensive,\r\nwith Great Britain.\" Adams retorted by asking whether, in such a case, if\r\n\"the population of the North should be cut off from its natural outlet\r\nupon the ocean, it would fall back upon its rocks bound hand and foot to\r\nstarve, or whether it would not retain its powers of locomotion to move\r\nsouthward by land?\" The compromise was, as Benton says, \"conceived and\r\npassed as a Southern measure,\" although Randolph called it a \"dirty\r\nbargain;\" nevertheless, on the final test vote thirty-five Southern\r\nmembers refused to admit the principle that Congress could prohibit\r\nslavery in the Territories. The South gained Missouri, and a few years\r\nlater Arkansas came in as a slave State; but in the long run the advantage\r\nwas to the North. The South got the small end of the triangle; the North\r\nthe whole region now occupied by the States of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, the\r\nDakotas, and Montana, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, and Minnesota; and\r\nthe final struggle over slavery was postponed for thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n128. RELATIONS WITH THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES (1815-1823).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish colonies.]\r\n[Sidenote: Revolutions.]\r\n\r\nWhile the attention of the country was absorbed by the Missouri struggle,\r\na new question of diplomacy had arisen. In 1789 almost every part of the\r\ntwo American continents south of the United States, except Brazil, was\r\nsubject to Spain. The American Revolution had given a shock to the\r\nprinciple of colonial government by European powers; the Spanish colonies\r\nrefused to acknowledge the authority of the French usurpers in Spain, and\r\nin 1808 a series of revolts occurred. At the restoration of the Spanish\r\nBourbons in 1814, the colonies returned to nominal allegiance. The new\r\nking attempted to introduce the old regime: the colonies had too long\r\nenjoyed the sweets of direct trade with other countries, and they resented\r\nthe ungentle attempts to restore them to complete dependence; between 1816\r\nand 1820 the provinces on the Rio de la Plata, Chile, and Venezuela again\r\nrevolted; and by 1822 there was a revolutionary government in every\r\ncontinental Spanish province, including Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Alliance.]\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention proposed.]\r\n\r\nWhen Europe was reorganized, after the fall of Napoleon, almost all the\r\npowers entered into a kind of a treaty, known as the Holy Alliance, framed\r\nSept. 26, 1815. They announced the future principle of international\r\nrelations to be that of \"doing each other reciprocal service, and of\r\ntestifying by unalterable good will the mutual affection with which they\r\nought to be animated,\" and that they considered themselves \"all as members\r\nof one and the same Christian nation.\" Within this pious verbiage was\r\nconcealed a plan of mutual assistance in case of the outbreak of\r\nrevolutions. When Spain revolted against her sovereign in 1820, a European\r\nCongress was held, and by its direction the French in 1823 a second time\r\nrestored the Spanish Bourbons. The grateful king insisted that the\r\nrevolution of the Spanish colonies ought to be put down by a common effort\r\nof the European powers, as a danger to the principle of hereditary\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American interests.]\r\n[Sidenote: Russian colonization.]\r\n[Sidenote: English proposals.]\r\n\r\nHere the interests of the United States became involved: they were trading\r\nfreely with the Spanish Americans; they sympathized with the new\r\ngovernments, which were nominally founded on the model of the North\r\nAmerican republic; they felt what now seems an unreasonable fear that\r\nEuropean powers would invade the United States. At the same time the\r\nRussians, who had obtained a foothold on the northwest coast fifty years\r\nearlier, were attempting to establish a permanent colony, and on Sept. 24,\r\n1821, issued a ukase forbidding all foreigners to trade on the Pacific\r\ncoast north of the fifty-first parallel, or to approach within one hundred\r\nItalian miles of the shore. John Quincy Adams, who had a quick eye for\r\nnational rights, protested vigorously.  Now came most gratifying evidence\r\nthat the United States was the leading power in America: in September,\r\n1823, the British government proposed to our minister in England that the\r\ntwo countries should unite in a declaration against European intervention\r\nin the colonies. The invitation was declined, but the good will of Great\r\nBritain was assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. THE MONROE DOCTRINE (1823).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's message.]\r\n[Sidenote: Colonization clause.]\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention Clause.]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams had succeeded in bringing the President to the point\r\nwhere he was willing, in behalf of the nation, to make a protest against\r\nboth these forms of interference in American affairs. When Congress met,\r\nin December, 1823, Monroe sent in a message embodying what is popularly\r\ncalled the Monroe Doctrine. He had taken the advice of Jefferson, who\r\ndeclared that one of the maxims of American policy was \"never to suffer\r\nEurope to meddle with cis-Atlantic affairs.\" Madison, with characteristic\r\ncaution, suggested an agreement with Great Britain to unite in \"armed\r\ndisapprobation.\" In the cabinet meeting, Adams pointed out that\r\nintervention would result, not in restoring the colonies to Spain, but in\r\ndividing them among European nations, in which case Russia might take\r\nCalifornia. His views prevailed, and the message contained, in the first\r\nplace, a clause directed against Russia: \"The American continents, by the\r\nfree and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained, are\r\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any\r\nEuropean powers.\" Against intervention there was even a stronger protest:\r\n\"With the governments who have declared their independence and maintained\r\nit,... we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing\r\nthem, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European\r\npower, in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly\r\ndisposition toward the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect.]\r\n\r\nIn every way this dignified protest was effectual: the news caused an\r\nimmediate rise in the funds of the revolted States in European markets;\r\nprojects of European intervention were at once abandoned; and Great\r\nBritain followed the United States in recognizing the independence of the\r\nnew countries. In 1824 Russia made a treaty agreeing to claim no territory\r\nsouth of 54° 40', and not to disturb or restrain citizens of the United\r\nStates in any part of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen Monroe retired from the Presidency on March 4, 1825, the internal\r\nauthority of the national government had for ten years steadily increased,\r\nand the dignity and influence of the nation abroad showed that it had\r\nbecome one of the world's great powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF POLITICAL REORGANIZATION (1824-1829).\r\n\r\n\r\n130.

POLITICAL METHODS IN 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Old statesmen gone.]\r\n\r\nThe United States was in 1825 half a century old, and the primitive\r\npolitical methods of the early republic were disappearing. Most of the\r\ngroup of Revolutionary statesmen were dead; Jefferson and John Adams still\r\nsurvived, and honored each other by renewing their ancient friendship; on\r\nJuly 4, 1826, they too passed away. The stately traditions of the colonial\r\nperiod were gone: since the accession of Jefferson, the Presidents no\r\nlonger rode in pomp to address Congress at the beginning of each session;\r\nand inferior and little-known men crept into Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New constitutions.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutions framed during or immediately after the Revolution had\r\nbeen found too narrow, and one after another, most of the States in the\r\nUnion had adopted a second, or even a third. Each change was marked by a\r\npopularization of the government, especially with regard to the suffrage.\r\nImmigrants had begun to have a sensible effect upon the community. In 1825\r\nthere were ten thousand, and the number more than doubled in five years.\r\nThese changes were reflected in the management of State politics; the\r\ngreater the number of voters, the greater the power of organization. Hence\r\nthere had sprung up in the States a system of political chiefs, of whom\r\nAaron Burr is a type.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political proscription.]\r\n[Sidenote: Four Years' Tenure Act.]\r\n\r\nThree new political devices had now become general among the States. The\r\nfirst was the removal of administrative officers because they did not\r\nagree in politics with the party which had elected a governor. This system\r\nwas in use in Pennsylvania as early as 1790; it was introduced into New\r\nYork by 1800, and gradually spread into other States. At first it was\r\nrather a factional weapon: when the adherents of the Livingstons got into\r\npower, they removed the friends of the Clintons; when the Clintonians came\r\nin, they turned out the Livingstons. Later, it was a recognized party\r\nsystem. In 1820 Secretary Crawford secured the passage by Congress of an\r\napparently innocent act, by which most of the officers of the national\r\ngovernment who collected and disbursed public money were to have terms of\r\nfour years. The ostensible object was to secure more regular statements of\r\naccounts; it was intended and used to drop from the public service\r\nsubordinates of the Treasury department who were not favorable to\r\nCrawford's Presidential aspirations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gerrymander.]\r\n\r\nThe second device appears to have been the invention of Elbridge Gerry,\r\nwhen governor of Massachusetts in 1812, and from him it takes the name of\r\nGermander, The Federalists were gaining in the State; the Republican\r\nlegislature, before it went out, therefore redistricted the State in such\r\nfashion that the Republicans with a minority of votes were able to choose\r\ntwenty-nine senators, against eleven Federalists. No wonder that the \"New\r\nEngland Palladium\" declared this to be \"contrary to republicanism and to\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political organization.]\r\n\r\nA third and very effective political device was the caucus. The term was\r\napplied particularly to a conference of the members of each party in\r\nCongress, which had taken upon itself the nomination of the Presidents.\r\nThe influence of the extending suffrage, and of political tricks and\r\ndevices, had as yet little effect in national politics. It was evident,\r\nhowever, that the principles of political manipulation could be applied in\r\nnational elections. The Republican party of New York was in 1825 managed\r\nby a knot of politicians called the Albany Regency. Of these, the ablest\r\nwas Martin Van Buren, and four years later he succeeded in building up a\r\nnational political machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n132. THE TARIFF OF 1824 (1816-1824).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the tariff.]\r\n\r\nAn evidence of political uneasiness was the Tariff Act of May 22, 1824.\r\nThe tariff of 1816 had not brought about the good that was expected of it:\r\nimportations of foreign goods were indeed cut down from $129,000,000 in\r\n1816 to $50,000,000 in 1823; but the balance of trade was still rather\r\nagainst the United States, and in 1819 there was a financial crisis. In\r\n1820 an act to raise the duties passed the House, but was lost in the\r\nSenate by a single vote. Manufactures had been growing, although profits\r\nwere not large, and public sentiment was beginning to change in New\r\nEngland. The Western vote was now larger than eight years earlier, and was\r\nin favor of protection. Exports of agricultural products had fallen off,\r\nand the agricultural States hoped to find a better market among the\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act of 1824.]\r\n\r\nIt was a favorable time for a tariff act, inasmuch as the friends of none\r\nof the Presidential candidates were willing to commit themselves against\r\nit. Clay came forward as the champion of the protective system: \"The\r\nobject of this bill,\" said he, \"is to create thus a home market, and to\r\nlay the foundation of a genuine American policy.\" The South now strongly\r\nand almost unanimously opposed the tariff; even Webster spoke against it,\r\ndeclaring \"freedom of trade to be the general principle, and restriction\r\nthe exception.\" A combination of the Middle and Western States with a part\r\nof New England furnished the necessary majority. The tariff increased the\r\nduties on metals like iron and lead, and on agricultural products like\r\nwool and hemp, but gave little additional protection to woollen and cotton\r\ngoods. As the bill approached its passage, John Randolph violently\r\nprotested: \"There never was a constitution under the sun in which by an\r\nunwise exercise of the powers of the government the people may not be\r\ndriven to the extremity of resistance by force.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n133. THE ELECTION OF 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Era of good feeling.]\r\n[Sidenote: Presidential candidates.]\r\n\r\nThe ground was now cleared for the choice of a successor to Monroe. The\r\nFederalist organization had entirely disappeared, even in the New England\r\nStates; all the candidates called themselves Republicans or Democrats,--\r\nthe terms were considered synonymous,--and there was little difference in\r\ntheir political principles. The second administration of Monroe has been\r\ncalled the \"Era of Good Feeling,\" because there was but one party; in fact\r\nit was an era of ill feeling, because that party was broken up into\r\npersonal factions. Three of the cabinet ministers and the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives were candidates for the succession to Monroe.\r\nCalhoun, Secretary of War, who still believed that it was to the interest\r\nof the nation and of the South to have a strong national government, came\r\nforward early, but quietly accepted an undisputed nomination for the Vice-\r\nPresidency. John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, was nominated by New\r\nEngland legislatures early in the year 1824. William H. Crawford of\r\nGeorgia, Secretary of the Treasury, succeeded in obtaining the formal\r\nnomination of the party caucus on Feb. 14, 1824; less than a third of the\r\nRepublican members were present, and the character of the nomination\r\nrather injured than aided Crawford. Henry Clay was nominated by the\r\nlegislatures of Kentucky and four other States; he was very popular in\r\nCongress and throughout the West. All three of the candidates just\r\nmentioned were in ability and experience well qualified to be President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Andrew Jackson.]\r\n\r\nA fourth candidate, at that time a Senator from Tennessee, was Gen. Andrew\r\nJackson. He was a rough frontiersman, skilled in Indian wars, but so\r\ninsubordinate in temper that in 1818 he had invaded Florida without\r\ninstructions; and Calhoun as Secretary of War had suggested in the cabinet\r\nthat he be court-martialed. Jackson himself at first held back, but in\r\n1822 he received the nomination of the Tennessee legislature, and in 1824\r\nthat of the legislature of Pennsylvania. Benton has called him \"the\r\ncandidate of the people, brought forward by the masses;\" he was really\r\nbrought forward by one of his neighbors, Major Lewis, who was convinced\r\nthat he had the elements of popularity, and who managed his campaign with\r\ngreat skill. But no combination could be made for him with the Albany\r\nRegency; Van Buren's organ, the \"Argus,\" said of him: \"He is respected as\r\na gallant soldier, but he stands, in the minds of the people of this\r\nState, at an immeasurable distance from the Executive Chair.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Electoral vote.]\r\n\r\nThe election showed that Jackson had ninety-nine electoral votes, Adams\r\neighty-four, Crawford forty-one, and Henry Clay thirty-seven, The popular\r\nvote, so far as it could be ascertained, was 150,000 for Jackson, and\r\nabout 110,000 for Adams. There was no clear indication of the people's\r\nwill, and under the Constitution the House of Representatives was to\r\nchoose the President from the three candidates who had received most\r\nelectoral votes. Several Clay electors had changed their votes to\r\nCrawford; the result was that Crawford, and not Clay, was third on the\r\nlist, and that Clay was made ineligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n134. THE ELECTION OF 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay favors Adams.]\r\n\r\nCrawford's influence had now much declined, so that Clay and his friends\r\nheld the balance of power between Jackson and Adams. On Jan. 8, 1825, Clay\r\nadvised his friends to vote for Adams, who was in every way the more\r\nsuitable candidate; he represented principles acceptable to the large\r\nmajority of voters; he favored a tariff; he was an enthusiastic advocate\r\nof internal improvements; he desired to make the influence of the United\r\nStates felt in South and Central America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election in the House.]\r\n\r\nThe vote in the House showed thirteen States for Adams, seven for Jackson,\r\nand four for Crawford. Jackson accepted the result calmly,--indeed Adams\r\nhad always shown a friendly spirit toward him, and had defended him in\r\n1818. Within a few days a rumor went abroad that Clay had sold his support\r\nof Adams for the appointment as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Corrupt bargain.\"]\r\n\r\nHe denied it, Adams denied it, and there has never been any\r\nproof to show that there had been an understanding between them or their\r\nfriends. Jackson's supporters, however, were quick to see the damaging\r\neffect of such a charge, and began to publish abroad the assertion that\r\nthere had been a corrupt bargain, or, as John Randolph put it, \"a\r\ncoalition of Blifil and Black George,--a combination, unheard of until\r\nnow, of the Puritan and the blackleg.\" Once persuaded that the charge was\r\ntrue, it was impossible to disabuse Jackson's mind, and during the next\r\nfour years his friends continued to assert that he had been deprived of\r\nthe Presidency by a trick.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Demos Krateo\".]\r\n\r\nAnother equally baseless and equally injurious charge was that the House\r\nhad violated the spirit of the Constitution by selecting a candidate who\r\nhad a less number of electoral votes than Jackson. \"The election of Mr.\r\nAdams,\" said Benton, \"was also a violation of the principle, Demos\r\nKrateo.\" In consequence, many members of Congress who had voted for Adams\r\nlost their seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n135. THE PANAMA CONGRESS (1825-1826).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adam's cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe new President was handicapped from the beginning of his administration\r\nby his inability to make up a strong cabinet. Clay was eager and\r\nventuresome; the other members, except Wirt, were not men of great force.\r\nAdams manfully withstood the pressure put upon him to remove the adherents\r\nof Crawford and of Jackson in the public service; a high-minded and\r\nmagnanimous man, he was determined that his administration should not\r\ndepend upon the political services of office-holders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proposed Spanish-American Congress.]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1824, Gen. Simon Bolivar had issued invitations to the\r\nSpanish American governments to send delegates to a Congress at Panama,\r\nand the invitation was later extended to the United States. One of the\r\nquestions to be discussed was \"resistance or opposition to the\r\ninterference of any neutral nation\" (§ 129). Another was \"the manner in\r\nwhich the colonization of European Powers on the American continent shall\r\nbe resisted.\" The evident purpose of the proposed meeting was to secure\r\nsome kind of joint agreement that the Monroe Doctrine should be enforced.\r\nIn such a meeting the United States might naturally expect to have a\r\npreponderating influence; and Clay accepted the invitation a few days\r\nbefore the first Congress under Adams's administration assembled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objections to the Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe proposition was taking, and it was undoubtedly in line with the policy\r\nof the preceding administration. Nevertheless it was resolved by the\r\nopponents of Adams to make a stand against it, and it was not until March\r\n14, 1826, that the nominations of the envoys were confirmed by the Senate.\r\nThe first objection to the scheme was that it would commit the United\r\nStates to a military defence of its neighbors. To this, Adams replied that\r\nhe intended only an \"agreement between all the parties represented at the\r\nmeeting, that each will guard by its own means against the establishment\r\nof any future European colony within its borders.\" Among the powers\r\ninvited to send delegates was Hayti, a republic of revolted slaves as yet\r\nunrecognized by the United States government. To Southern statesmen,\r\nassociation with Hayti meant an encouragement to slave-insurrection in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Connection with Monroe Doctrine.]\r\n\r\nThe controversy was now transferred to the House, where an informal\r\nresolution was passed that the United States \"ought not to become parties\r\n... to any joint declaration for the purpose of preventing the\r\ninterference of any of the European powers.\" The necessary appropriations\r\nwere with difficulty secured, and the envoys despatched Before they\r\nreached Panama the Congress had adjourned, and it never reassembled. The\r\ninstability of the Spanish-American governments was such that any joint\r\nagreement must have obliged the United States to assume great\r\nresponsibilities, without any corresponding advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n136. INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS (1817-1829).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's veto.]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the bonus bill in 1817 (Section 121) had only checked the\r\nprogress of internal improvements. The Cumberland road had been slowly\r\nextended westward, and up to 1821 $1,800,000 had been appropriated for it;\r\nbut on May 4, 1822, Monroe vetoed a bill for its preservation and repair.\r\nThe technical objection was that tolls were to be charged; in fact, the\r\nveto was, like Madison's, a warning to Congress not to go too far.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First harbor bill.]\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminary surveys.]\r\n[Sidenote: Stock subscriptions.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on March 3, 1823, a clause in a lighthouse bill appropriated\r\n$6,150 for the improvement of harbors. Up to this time the States had made\r\nsuch improvements, reimbursing themselves in part out of dues laid by\r\nconsent of Congress on the shipping using the harbor. The next year\r\nanother step in advance was taken by appropriating $30,000 for preliminary\r\nsurveys: the expectation was that the whole ground would be gone over, and\r\nthat the most promising improvements would be undertaken and finished\r\nfirst.  A third step was the act of March 3, 1825, by which the United\r\nStates subscribed $300,000 to the stock of the Chesapeake and Delaware\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Adams's administration, therefore, the country seemed\r\nfully committed to the doctrine that, under the Constitution as it stood,\r\nCongress might build works, or subscribe money to aid in their\r\nconstruction, and ought to look forward to completing a general system.\r\nClay had declared, Jan. 17, 1825, that he considered the question of\r\ncarrying into effect \"a system of internal improvements as amounting to\r\nthe question whether the union of these States should be preserved or\r\nnot;\" and in his inaugural address, March 4, 1825, Adams urged the\r\ncontinuance of the system.  Here again appeared opposition, partly\r\nsectional, and partly intended to embarrass Adams. The Virginia\r\nlegislature declared internal improvements unconstitutional; and on Dec.\r\n20, 1826, Van Buren introduced a resolution denying the right of Congress\r\nto construct roads and canals within the States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land grants.]\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution.]\r\n\r\nAn effort was now made to avoid the question of appropriating money by\r\nsetting apart public lands. Grants of eight hundred thousand acres of land\r\nwere made for the construction of canals in Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois,\r\nand such gifts continued at irregular intervals down to 1850. Since the\r\ndebt was rapidly disappearing, another suggestion was that the surplus\r\nrevenue should be periodically divided among the States. It satisfied no\r\none. As Hayne of South Carolina said: \"We are to have doled out to us as a\r\nfavor the money which has first been drawn from our own pockets,...\r\nkeeping the States forever in a state of subserviency.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The system losing ground.]\r\n\r\nAlthough $2,310,000 were appropriated for internal improvements during\r\nAdams's administration, on the whole the system was growing unpopular.\r\nCalhoun, who as Secretary of War in 1819 had recommended a judicious\r\nsystem of roads and canals, in 1822 said that on mature consideration he\r\ndid not see that the requisite power was given to Congress in the\r\nConstitution. On the whole, Adams's enemies opposed the appropriations.\r\n\r\n\r\n137. THE CREEK AND CHEROKEE QUESTIONS (1824-1829).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tribal governments.]\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty with Georgia.]\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty inherited by Adams's administration arose out of the\r\npromise of the United States in 1802 to remove the Indians from within the\r\nlimits of Georgia as soon as possible. The two principal tribes were the\r\nCreeks and the Cherokees, both partially civilized and settled on\r\npermanent farms, and both enjoying by treaty with the United States a\r\ntribal government owing no allegiance to Georgia. On Feb. 12, 1825, a\r\ntreaty had been signed by a few Creek chiefs without the authority or\r\nconsent of the nation, by which they purported to give up lands of the\r\ntribe in Georgia. In defiance of the government at Washington, the Georgia\r\nauthorities proceeded to survey the lands, without waiting to have the\r\ntreaty examined; and Governor Troup called upon the legislature to \"stand\r\nto your arms,\" and wrote to the Secretary of War that \"President Adams\r\nmakes the Union tremble on a bauble.\" In a sober report to the legislature\r\nit was urged that the time was rapidly approaching when the Slave States\r\nmust \"confederate.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflict of authority.]\r\n\r\nThe survey was suspended; but on Nov. 8, 1825, Governor Troup advised the\r\nlegislature that \"between States equally independent it is not required of\r\nthe weaker to yield to the stronger. Between sovereigns the weaker is\r\nequally qualified to pass upon its rights.\" On Jan. 24, 1826, a new treaty\r\nwas negotiated, by which a considerable part of the disputed territory was\r\ngiven to Georgia. Again the State attempted to survey the lands before the\r\ntransfer was completed, and again Adams interposed. On Feb. 17, 1827,\r\nGovernor Troup called out the State militia to resist the United States\r\ntroops. Congress was rather pleased at the humiliation to the President,\r\nand declined to support him; he was obliged to yield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cherokees subdued.]\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees, more highly civilized and better organized than the Creeks,\r\ncould not be entrapped into any treaty for surrendering their lands.\r\nGeorgia, therefore, proceeded to assert her jurisdiction over them,\r\nwithout reference to the solemn treaties of the United States. Each\r\nsuccessive legislature from 1826 passed an Act narrowing the circle of\r\nIndian authority. In December, 1826, Indian testimony was declared invalid\r\nin Georgia courts. The Cherokees, foreseeing the coming storm, and warned\r\nby the troubles of their Creek neighbors, proceeded to adopt a new tribal\r\nconstitution, under which all land was to be tribal property. The Georgia\r\nlegislature replied, in 1827, by annexing part of the Cherokee territory\r\nto two counties; the purpose was to drive out the Cherokees by making them\r\nsubject to discriminating State laws, and by taking away the land not\r\nactually occupied as farms. The issue raised was whether the United States\r\nor Georgia had governmental powers in Indian reservations. By a close vote\r\nthe House intimated its sympathy with Georgia, and in December, 1828,\r\nGeorgia proposed to annex the whole Cherokee country. Adams was powerless\r\nto defend the Indians; in order to humiliate the President, the national\r\nauthority had successfully been defied.\r\n\r\n\r\n138. THE TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS (1828).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commercial treaties.]\r\n[Sidenote: Woollen bill.]\r\n\r\nIn one respect Adams was successful; he negotiated almost as many\r\ncommercial treaties as had been secured during the previous fifty years.\r\nTrade had sprung up with the Spanish American States. England had\r\nmeanwhile begun to relax her system of protection, and encouraged\r\nmanufactures by importing raw materials on very low duties; woollens were\r\ntherefore so cheapened that they could again be sold in the United States\r\nin competition with American manufacturers. In October, 1826, the Boston\r\nwoollen manufacturers asked \"the aid of the government.\" A bill was\r\naccordingly introduced, which Adams would doubtless have signed,\r\nincreasing the duties on coarse woollens. It passed the House in 1827, but\r\nwas lost in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vice-President, Calhoun.\r\nHis change of attitude is significant; it showed that the most advanced\r\nSouthern statesman had abandoned the policy of protection, as he had\r\nabandoned the policy of internal improvements. The Boston petition marked\r\nanother change. New England had at last settled down to manufacturing as\r\nher chief industry, and insisted on greater protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff agitation.]\r\n\r\nThe narrow failure of the Woollens Bill in 1827 encouraged a protectionist\r\nconvention at Harrisburg, which suggested very high duties; but the main\r\nforce behind the movement was a combination of the growers and\r\nmanufacturers of wool, including many Western men. It is probable that\r\nClay was glad to make the tariff a political issue, hoping thus to\r\nconfound the anti-Adams combination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff on raw materials.]\r\n[Sidenote: The act passed.]\r\n\r\nA new bill was reported, introducing the novel principle that the raw\r\nmaterials of manufactures should be highly protected; the purpose was\r\nevidently to frame a tariff unacceptable to New England, where Adams had\r\nhis chief support, and to draw the votes of the South and West. The\r\nWestern Jackson men favored it because it raised the tariff; and the\r\nSouthern anti-tariff men expected to kill Adams with the bill, and then to\r\nkill the bill. They therefore voted for enormous duties: the duty on hemp\r\nwas raised from $35 to $60 a ton; on wool from about thirty per cent to\r\nabout seventy per cent. In vain did the Adams men attempt to reframe the\r\nbill: when it came to a vote, sixteen of the thirty-nine New England\r\nmembers felt compelled to accept it, with all its enormities, and it thus\r\npassed the House. Even Webster voted for it in the Senate, and his\r\ninfluence secured its passage. On May 24, 1828, Adams signed it.\r\nThroughout the debate the influence of the approaching campaign was seen.\r\nJohn Randolph said of it: \"The bill referred to manufactures of no sort or\r\nkind except the manufacture of a President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern protests.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these political complications the South saw clearly that\r\nthe act meant a continuance of the protective system. Five States at once\r\nprotested in set terms against the law and against the passage by Congress\r\nof protective acts. Calhoun came forward as the champion of this movement,\r\nand he put forth an argument, known as the South Carolina Exposition, in\r\nwhich he suggested a convention of the State of South Carolina. \"The\r\nconvention will then decide in what manner they [the revenue acts] ought\r\nto be declared null and void within the limits of the State, which solemn\r\ndeclaration would be obligatory on our own citizens.\" The period of the\r\nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions seemed to have returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n139. ORGANIZED OPPOSITION TO ADAMS (1825-1829).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that on most of the great questions which arose in\r\nAdams's administration there was a division, not so much on principle, as\r\nbetween the friends and opponents of the President. The four years of his\r\nadministration were really a long drawn Presidential campaign. The friends\r\nof Jackson sought in every possible way to make Adams odious in the public\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive patronage.]\r\n[Sidenote: Retrenchment.]\r\n\r\nOne of the early evidences of this personal opposition was a report\r\nbrought in, May 4, 1826, by a Select Committee on Executive Patronage; it\r\nincluded Benton and Van Buren, who had heartily given in his adhesion to\r\nJackson. They reported that the exercise of great patronage by one man was\r\ndangerous, and they proposed that a constitutional amendment be secured,\r\nforbidding the appointment of senators or representatives to office. In\r\nthe next Congress, from 1827 to 1829, the Jackson men had a majority in\r\nboth Houses, and an attempt was made to prejudice Adams by showing that\r\nthe government was extravagant. Resolutions were adopted calling for a\r\nretrenchment; but no misuse of the public money could be brought home to\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nThe so-called investigations were only political manoeuvres: a President\r\nwho permitted his political enemies to remain in office was upbraided for\r\nabusing the appointing power, a President who had never removed one person\r\nfor political reason was accused of a misuse of the removing power.\r\nNevertheless, the steady waning of Adams's popularity shows that he was\r\nnot in accord with the spirit of the people of his time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's campaign.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Democrats.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a formidable combination had been formed against him. In\r\nOctober, 1825, Jackson had been re-nominated by the Tennessee legislature.\r\nCrawford's health had failed, and his followers, chiefly Southern men,\r\nthrew in their lot with Jackson. Van Buren prepared to renew the\r\ncombination of Southern and Middle State votes which had been so\r\nsuccessful in 1800. His organizing skill was necessary, for the Jackson\r\nmen lacked both coherence and principles. Strong bank men, anti-bank men,\r\nprotectionists, and free-traders united in the support of Jackson, whose\r\nviews on all these points were unknown. Towards the end of Adams's\r\nadministration the opposition began to take upon itself the name of the\r\nDemocratic party; but what the principles of that party were to be was as\r\nyet uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n140. THE TRIUMPH OF THE PEOPLE (1828).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adams's policy.]\r\n[Sidenote: New political forces.]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams's principles of government were not unlike those of his\r\nfather: both believed in a brisk, energetic national administration, and\r\nin extending the influence and upholding the prestige of the United States\r\namong foreign powers. John Adams built ships; John Quincy Adams built\r\nroads and canals. Both Presidents were trained statesmen of the same\r\nschool as their English and French contemporaries. The outer framework of\r\ngovernment had little altered since its establishment in 1789; within the\r\nnation, however, a great change had taken place. The disappearance of the\r\nFederalists had been followed by a loss of the political and social pre-\r\neminence so long enjoyed by the New England clergy; and in 1835 the\r\nCongregational Church was disestablished in Massachusetts. The rise of\r\nmanufactures had hastened these changes, both by creating a new moneyed\r\nclass, and by favoring the increase of independent mill-hands having the\r\nsuffrage and little or no property. Cities were growing rapidly,\r\nespecially in the Middle States: in 1822 Boston gave up the town-meeting;\r\nin 1830 New York had two hundred thousand inhabitants, and Philadelphia\r\none hundred and seventy thousand; and the voters in the cities were more\r\neasily controlled by a few master minds. In the South alone was the old\r\nprinciple of government by family and influence preserved; but even here\r\nthe suffrage was widely extended, and the small planters had to be\r\ntenderly handled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of the West.]\r\n\r\nThe West was the most important new element in the government. The votes\r\nof the States west of the mountains elected Jefferson in 1800, and Madison\r\nin 1812, and gave Jackson his preponderance of electoral votes over Adams\r\nin 1824. The West was at this time what the colonies had been half a\r\ncentury earlier,--a thriving, bustling, eager community, with a keen sense\r\nof trade, and little education. But, unlike the colonies, the West was\r\nalmost without the tradition of an aristocracy; in most of the States\r\nthere was practically manhood suffrage. Men were popular, not because they\r\nhad rendered the country great services, but because they were good\r\nfarmers, bold pioneers, or shrewd lawyers. Smooth intriguers, mere\r\ndemagogues, were not likely to gain the confidence of the West, but a\r\npositive and forcible character won their admiration. It was a people\r\nstirred by men like Henry Clay, great public speakers, leaders in public\r\nassemblies, impassioned advocates of the oppressed in other lands. It was\r\na people equally affected by the rough and ruthless character of men like\r\nJackson. An account which purports to come from Davy Crockett illustrates\r\nthe political horse-play of the time. In 1830 he was an anti-Jackson\r\ncandidate for re-election to Congress. He was beaten, by his opponents\r\nmaking unauthorized appointments for him to speak, without giving him\r\nnotice. The people assembled, Crockett was not there to defend himself,\r\nhis enemies said that he was afraid to come, and no later explanations\r\ncould satisfy his constituents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General ticket system.]\r\n\r\nThe political situation was still further complicated by the adoption in\r\nnearly all the States of the general ticket system of choosing electors; a\r\nsmall majority in New York and Pennsylvania might outweigh large\r\nmajorities in other States. In a word, democracy was in the saddle; the\r\nmajority of voters preferred a President like themselves to a President of\r\nsuperior training and education. Sooner or later they must combine; and\r\nonce combined they would elect him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Democracy vs. tradition.]\r\n\r\nThere was practically but one issue in 1828,--a personal choice between\r\nJohn Quincy Adams and Jackson. Not one of the voters knew Jackson's\r\nopinions on the tariff or internal improvements,--the only questions on\r\nwhich a political issue could have been made. It was a strife between\r\ndemocracy and tradition. A change of twenty-six thousand votes would have\r\ngiven to John Quincy Adams the vote of Pennsylvania and the election; but\r\nit could only have delayed the triumph of the masses. Jackson swept every\r\nSouthern and Western State, and received six hundred and fifty thousand\r\npopular votes, against five hundred thousand for Adams. It was evident\r\nthat there had risen up \"a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Formation of the Union, by Albert Bushnell Hart",
