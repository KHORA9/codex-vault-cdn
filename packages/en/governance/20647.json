Others have\r\nbeen cut short in the midst of a great work, but their books being\r\nnarrative merely, may close at almost any period, and be complete; or\r\nothers after them may take up the pen and conclude that which was so\r\nabruptly terminated. So it was with Macaulay; he was fascinating, and\r\nhis productions were literally devoured by readers of elevated taste,\r\nthough they disagreed almost entirely with his conclusions. His volumes\r\nwere read--as one reads Dickens, or Holmes, or De Quincey--to amuse in\r\nleisure hours.\r\n\r\nBut such are not the motives with which we take up the ponderous tomes\r\nof the historian of Civilization in England. He had no heroes to\r\nimmortalize by extravagant eulogy, no prejudices seeking vent to cover\r\nthe name of any man with infamy. He knew no William to convert into a\r\ndemi-god; no Marlborough who was the embodiment of all human vices. His\r\nmind, discarding the ordinary prejudices of the historian, took a wider\r\nrange, and his researches were not into the transactions of a particular\r\nmonarch or minister, as such, but into the _laws_ of human action, and\r\ntheir results upon the civilization of the race. Hence, while he wrote\r\nhistory, he plunged into all the depths of philosophy; and thus it is,\r\nthat his work, left unfinished by himself, can never be completed by\r\nanother. It is a work which will admit no broken link from its\r\ncommencement to its conclusion.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle was born in London, in the early part of the year 1824, and\r\nwas consequently about thirty-eight years of age at the time of his\r\ndeath. His father was a wealthy gentleman of the metropolis, and\r\nthoroughly educated, and the historian was an only son. Devoted to\r\nliterature himself, it is not surprising that the parent spared neither\r\nmoney nor labor to educate his child. He did not, however, follow the\r\nusual course; did not hamper the youthful mind by the narrow routine of\r\nthe English academy, nor did he make him a Master of Arts at Oxford or\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nHis early education was superintended by his father directly, but\r\nafterward private teachers were employed. But Mr. Buckle was by nature a\r\nclose student, and much that he possessed he acquired without a tutor,\r\nas his energetic, self-reliant nature rendered him incapable of ever\r\nseeing insurmountable difficulties before him. By this means he became\r\nwhat the students of Oxford rarely are, both learned and liberal. As he\r\nmingled freely with the people, during his youth, a democratic sympathy\r\nentwined itself with his education, and is manifested in every page of\r\nhis writings.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle never married. After he had commenced his great work, he\r\nfound no time to enjoy society, no hours of leisure and repose. His\r\nwhole soul was engaged in the accomplishment of one great purpose, and\r\nnothing which failed to contribute directly to the object nearest his\r\nheart, received a moment's consideration. He collected around him a\r\nlibrary of twenty-two thousand volumes, all choice standard works, in\r\nGreek, Latin, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and English, with all of\r\nwhich languages he was familiar. It was the best private collection of\r\nbooks, said some one, in England. It was from this that the historian\r\ndrew that inexhaustible array of facts, and procured the countless\r\nillustrations, with which the two volumes of his History of Civilization\r\nabound.\r\n\r\nAt what age he first conceived the project of writing his history, is\r\nnot yet publicly known. He never figured in the literary world previous\r\nto the publication of his first volume. He appears to have early grasped\r\nat more than a mere temporary fame, and determined to stake all upon a\r\nsingle production. His reading was always systematic, and exceedingly\r\nthorough; and as he early became charmed with the apparent harmony of\r\nall nature, whether in the physical, intellectual, or moral world, he at\r\nonce commenced tracing out the laws of the universe, to which, in his\r\nmind, all things were subject, with a view of illustrating that\r\nbeautiful harmony, every where prevailing, every where unbroken. All\r\nthis influenced every thing, 'and mind and gross matter, each performed\r\ntheir parts, in relative proportions, and according to the immutable\r\nlaws of progress.'\r\n\r\nWith a view of discussing his subject thoroughly, and establishing his\r\ntheory beyond controversy, as he believed, he proposed, before referring\r\nto the _History of Civilization in England_, to discover, so far as\r\npossible, all the laws of political and social economy, and establish\r\nthe relative powers and influence of the moral faculties, the intellect,\r\nand external nature, and determine the part each takes in contributing\r\nto the progress of the world. To this, the first volume is exclusively\r\ndevoted; and it is truly astonishing to observe the amount of research\r\ndisplayed. The author is perfectly familiar, not only with a vast array\r\nof facts of history, but with the principal discoveries of every branch\r\nof science; and as he regards all things as a unit, he sets out by\r\nsaying that no man is competent to write history who is not familiar\r\nwith the physical universe. A fascinating writer, with a fair industry,\r\ncan write narrative, but not history.\r\n\r\nThis is taking in a wide field; and Mr. Buckle may be regarded as\r\nsomewhat egotistic and vain; but the fact that he proves himself, in a\r\ngreat degree, the possessor of the knowledge he conceives requisite,\r\nrather than asserts it, is a sufficient vindication against all\r\naspersions.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle regards physical influences as the primary motive power which\r\nproduces civilization; but these influences are fixed in their nature,\r\nand are few in number, and always operate with equal power. The capacity\r\nof the intellect is unlimited; it grows and expands, partially impelled\r\nby surrounding physical circumstances, and partially by its own second\r\nsuggestions, growing out of those primary impressions received from\r\nnature. The moral influence, the historian asserts, is the weakest of\r\nthe three, which control the destiny of man. Not an axiom now current,\r\nbut was known and taught in the days of Plato, of Zoroaster, and of\r\nConfucius; yet how wide the gap intervening between the civilization of\r\nthe different eras! Moral without intellectual culture, is nothing; but\r\nwith the latter, the former comes as a necessary sequence.\r\n\r\nAll individual examples are rejected. As all things act in harmony, we\r\ncan only draw deductions by regarding the race in the aggregate, and\r\nstudying its progress through long periods of time. Statistics is the\r\nbasis of all generalizations, and it is only from a close comparison of\r\nthese, for ages, that the harmonious movement of all things can be\r\nclearly proved.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle was a fatalist in every sense of the word. Marriages, deaths,\r\nbirths, crime--all are regulated by Law. The moral status of a community\r\nis illustrated by the number of depredations committed, and their\r\ncharacter. Following the suggestions of M. Quetelot, he brings forward\r\nan array of figures to prove that not only, in a large community, is\r\nthere about the same number of crimes committed each year, but their\r\ncharacter is similar, and even the instruments employed in committing\r\nthem are nearly the same. Of course, outside circumstances modify this\r\nslightly--such as financial failures, scarcity of bread, etc., but by a\r\ncomparison of long periods of time, these influences recur with perfect\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nIt is not the individual, in any instance, who is the criminal--but\r\nsociety. The murderer and the suicide are not responsible, but are\r\nmerely public executioners. Through them the depravity of the _public_\r\nfinds vent.\r\n\r\nFree Will and Predestination--the two dogmas which have, more than any\r\nothers, agitated the public mind--are discussed at length. Of course he\r\naccepts the latter theory, but under a different name. Free Will, he\r\ncontends, inevitably leads to aristocracy, and Predestination to\r\ndemocracy; and the British and Scottish churches are cited as examples\r\nof the effect of the two doctrines on ecclesiastical organizations. The\r\nformer is an aristocracy, the latter a democracy.\r\n\r\nNo feature of Mr. Buckle's work is so prominent as its democratic\r\ntendencies. The people, and the means by which they can be elevated,\r\nwere uppermost in his mind, and he disposes of established usages, and\r\naristocratic institutions, in a manner far more American than English.\r\nIt is this circumstance which has endeared him to the people of this\r\ncountry, and to the liberals of Germany--the work having been translated\r\ninto German. For the same reason, he was severely criticised in England.\r\n\r\nHaving devoted the first volume to a discussion of the laws of\r\ncivilization, it was his intention to publish two additional volumes,\r\nillustrating them; taking the three countries in which were found\r\ncertain prominent characteristics, which he conceived could be fully\r\naccounted for by his theories, but by no other, and above all, by none\r\nfounded upon the doctrine of free will and individual responsibility.\r\nThese countries were Spain, Scotland, and the United States--nations\r\nwhich grew up under the most diverse physical influences, and which\r\npresent widely different civilizations.\r\n\r\nThe volume treating upon Spain and Scotland has been published about a\r\nyear; and great was the indignation it created in the latter country. In\r\nSpain it is probable that the work is unknown; but it was caught up by\r\nthe Scottish reviewers, who are shocked at any thing outside of regular\r\nroutine, and whose only employment seems to be to strangle young\r\nauthors. _Blackwood_, and the _Edinburgh Review_, contained article\r\nafter article against the 'accuser' of Scotland; but the writers,\r\ninstead of calmly sifting and disproving Mr. Buckle's untenable\r\ntheories, new into a rage, and only established two things, to the\r\nintelligent public--their own malice and ignorance.\r\n\r\nAmid all this abuse, our author stood immutable. But once did he ever\r\ncondescend to notice his maligners, and then only to expose their\r\nignorance, at the same time pledging himself never again to refer to\r\ntheir attacks. A thinking man, he could not but be fully aware that\r\ntheir style, and self-evident malice, could only add to his reputation.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, he did not write to immortalize a hero, but to\r\nestablish an idea; did not labor to please the fancy, but to reach the\r\nunderstanding; hence we read his books, not as we do the brilliant\r\nproductions of Macaulay, the smooth narratives of Prescott, or the\r\ndramatic pages of Bancroft; but his thoughts are so well connected, and\r\nso systematically arranged, that to read a single page, is to insure a\r\nclose study of the whole volume. We would not study him for his style,\r\nfor although fair, it is not pleasing; we can not glide over his pages\r\nin thoughtless ease; but then, at the close of almost every paragraph,\r\none must pause and _think_.\r\n\r\nBeing an original writer, Mr. Buckle naturally fell into numerous\r\nerrors; but now is not the proper time to refute them. He gives more\r\nthan due weight to the powers of nature, in the civilization of man; and\r\nalthough he probably intimates the fact, yet he does _not_ add that as\r\nthe intellect is enlightened, their influences become circumscribed, and\r\nmust gradually almost entirely disappear. In the primitive state of the\r\nrace, climate, soil, food, and scenery, are all-powerful; but among an\r\nenlightened people, the effects of heat and cold, of barren or\r\nexceedingly productive soils, etc., are entirely modified. This omission\r\nhas given his enemies an excellent opportunity for a display of their\r\nrefutory powers, of which they have not failed to avail themselves.\r\n\r\nThe historian is a theorist, yet no controversialist. He states his\r\nfacts, and draws his conclusions, as if no ideas different from his own\r\nhad ever been promulgated. He never attempts to show the fallacies of\r\nany other author, but readily understands that if he establishes his\r\nsystem of philosophy, all contrary ones must fall. How fortunate it\r\nwould have been for the human race, if all innovators and reformers had\r\ndone the same!\r\n\r\nThat which adds to the regrets occasioned by his loss, which must be\r\nentertained by every American, is the circumstance that his forthcoming\r\nvolume was to be devoted to the social and political condition of the\r\nUnited States, as an example of a country in which existed a general\r\ndiffusion of knowledge. Knowing, as all his readers do, that his\r\nsympathies are democratic, and in favor of the elevation of the masses,\r\nwe had a right to expect a vindication-the first we ever had--from an\r\nEnglish source. At the time of his death he was traveling through Europe\r\nand Asia for his health, intending to arrive in this country in autumn,\r\nto procure facts as a basis for his third volume, and the last of his\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nAlthough his work is an unfinished one, it will remain a lasting\r\nmonument to the industry of its author. He has done enough to exhibit\r\nthe necessity of studying and writing history, henceforth as a\r\n_science_; and of replacing the chaotic fragments of narrative, called\r\nhistory, with which the world abounds, by a systematic statement of\r\nfacts, and philosophical deductions. Some other author, with sufficient\r\nenergy and industry, will--not finish the work of Mr. Buckle, but--write\r\nanother in which the faults of the original will be corrected, and the\r\nomissions filled; who will go farther in defining the relative\r\ninfluences of the three powers which control civilization, during the\r\ndifferent stages of human progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANGEL ON EARTH.\r\n\r\n  Die when you may, you will not wear\r\n  At heaven's court a form more fair\r\n    Than beauty at your birth has given;\r\n  Keep but the lips, the eyes we see,\r\n  The voice we hear, and you will be\r\n    An angel ready-made for heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLLY O'MOLLY PAPERS.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter than wealth, better than hosts of friends, better than genius, is\r\na mind that finds enjoyment in little things--that sucks honey from the\r\nblossom of the weed as well as from the rose--that is not too dainty to\r\nenjoy coarse, everyday fare. I am thankful that, though not born under a\r\nlucky star, I wasn't born under a melancholy one; that, though there\r\nwere at my christening no kind fairies to bestow on me all the blessings\r\nof life--there was no malignant elf to 'mingle a curse with every\r\nblessing.' I'd rather have a few drops of pure sweet than an overflowing\r\ncup tinctured with bitterness.\r\n\r\nNot that sorrow has never blown her chill breath on my spirit--yet it\r\nhas never been so iced over that it would not here and there bubble\r\nforth with a song of gladness.... There are depths of woe that I have\r\nnever fathomed, or rather, to which I have never sunken--for there are\r\nno line and plummet to sound the dreary depths--yet the waves have\r\noverwhelmed me, as every human being, but I soon rose above them.\r\n\r\n  'One by one thy griefs shall meet thee,\r\n    Do not fear an armed band;\r\n  One shall fade as others greet thee--\r\n    Shadows passing through the land.'\r\n\r\nI have found this true--I know there are some to whom it is not\r\ntrue--that, though sorrows come not to them 'in battalions,' the shadow\r\nof the one huge Grief is ever on their path, or on their heart; that at\r\ntheir down-sittings and their up-risings it is with them, even darkening\r\nto them the night, and making them almost curse the sunshine; for it is\r\never between them and it--not a mere shadow, nor yet a substance, but a\r\n_vacuum of light_, casting also a shadow. Neither substance nor shadow,\r\nit must be a phantom--it may be of a dead sin--and against such,\r\nexorcism avails. I opine this exorcism lies in no cabalistic words, no\r\ncrossing of the forehead, no holy name, in nothing that one can do unto\r\nor for himself, but in entire self-forgetfulness--in doing for, in\r\nsympathizing with, others. So shall this Grief step aside from your\r\npath, get away from between you and the sunshine, till finally it shall\r\nhave vanished.\r\n\r\nI know--not, however, by experience--that a great _sorrow-berg_, with\r\nbase planted in the under-current of a man's being, has been borne at a\r\nfearful rate, right up against all his nobly-built hopes and projects,\r\nmaking a complete wreck of them. May God help him then! But must his\r\nbeing ever after be like the lonely Polar Sea on which no bark was ever\r\nlaunched?\r\n\r\nBut surely we have troubles enough without borrowing from the future or\r\nthe past, as we constantly do. It is often said, it is a good thing that\r\nwe can't look into the future. One would think that that mysterious\r\nfuture, on which we are the next moment to enter, in which we are to\r\nlive our everyday life--one would think it a store-house of evils. Do\r\nyou expect no good--are there for you no treasures there?\r\n\r\nHow often life has been likened to a journey, a pilgrimage, with its\r\ndeserts to cross, its mountains to climb!... The road to---- Lake,\r\ndistant from my home some eight or ten miles, partly lies through a\r\nmountain pass. You drive a few miles--and a beautiful drive it is, with\r\nits pines and hemlocks, their dark foliage contrasting with the blue\r\nsky--on either hand high mountains; now at your left, then at your\r\nright, and again at your left runs now swiftly over stones, now\r\nlingering in hollows, making good fishing-places, a creek, that has come\r\nmany glad miles on its way to the river. But how are you to get over\r\nthat mountain just before you? Your horse can't draw you up its rocky,\r\nperpendicular front! Never mind, drive along--there, the mountain is\r\nbehind you--the road has wound around it. Thus it is with many a\r\nmountain difficulty in our way, we never have it to climb. There is now\r\nand then one, though, that we do have to climb, and we can't be drawn or\r\ncarried up by a faithful nag, but our weary feet must toil up its steep\r\nand rugged side. But many a pilgrim before us has climbed it, and we\r\nwill not faint on the way. 'What man has done, man may do.' ... Yet,\r\ntill I have found out to a certainty, I never will be sure that the\r\nmountain that seemingly blocks up my way, _has not a path winding round\r\nit_.\r\n\r\nThen the past.... Some one says we are happier our whole life for having\r\nspent one pleasant day. Keats says: 'A thing of beauty is a joy\r\n_forever_.' I believe this: to me the least enjoyment has been like a\r\ngrain of musk dropped into my being, sending its odor into all my\r\nafter-life--it may be that centuries hence it will not have lost its\r\nfragrance. Who knows?\r\n\r\nBut sorrows--they should, like bitter medicines, be washed down with\r\nsweet; we should get the taste of them out of our mouth as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe are as apt to borrow trouble from the might-have-beens of our past\r\nlife as from any thing else. We mourn over the chances we've missed--the\r\nhappiness that eel-like has slipped through our fingers. This is folly;\r\nfor generally there are so many ifs in the way, that nearly all the\r\nmight-have-beens turn into couldn't-have-beens. Even if they do not, it\r\nis well for us when we don't know them.... The object of our weary\r\nsearch glides past us like Gabriel past Evangeline, so near, did we only\r\nknow it: happy is it for us if we do not, like her, too late learn it;\r\nfor\r\n\r\n  'Of all sad words of tongue or pen,\r\n  The saddest are these--_it might have been!_'\r\n\r\nSo sad are they, that they would be a suitable refrain to the song of a\r\nlost spirit.\r\n\r\nWell, I might have been ----, but am ----\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to know how barren one's life is of events, the best way\r\nis to try to keep a journal. I tried it in my boarding-school days. With\r\na few exceptions, the record of one day's outer life was sufficient for\r\nthe week; the rest might have been written _ditto, ditto_. Even then,\r\nthe events were so trifling that, like entries in a ledger, they might\r\nhave been classed as _sundries_. How I tried to get up thoughts and\r\nfeelings to make out a decent day's chronicle! How I threw in profound\r\nremarks on what I had read, sketches of character, caricatures of the\r\nteachers, even condescending to give the bill of fare; here, too, there\r\nmight have been a great many _dittos_. Had I kept a record of my\r\ndream-life, what a variety there would have been! what extravagances,\r\nexceeded by nothing out of the _Arabian Nights' Entertainments_. Then,\r\nif I could have illuminated each day's page with my own fancy portrait\r\nof myself, the _Book of Beauty_ would not have been a circumstance to my\r\njournal. Certainly, among these portraits would not have been that\r\nplain, snub-nosed daguerreotype, sealed and directed to a dear home\r\nfriend; but to the dear home friend no picture in the _Book of Beauty_\r\nor my fancy journal would have had such charms; and if the daguerreotype\r\nwould not have illuminated this journal, it was itself illuminated _by\r\nthe light of a mother's love_. Alas! this light never more can rest on\r\nand irradiate the plain face of Molly O'Molly.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what a dull, monotonous life ours would be, if within this\r\nouter life there were not the inner life, the 'wheel within the wheel,'\r\nas in Ezekiel's vision. Though this inner wheel is 'lifted up\r\nwhithersoever the spirit' wills 'to go,' the outer--unlike that in the\r\nvision--is not also lifted up; perhaps _hereafter_ it will be.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans believe that, although unseen by mortals, 'the decreed\r\nevents of every man's life are impressed in divine characters on his\r\nforehead.' If so, I shouldn't wonder if there was generally a large\r\nmargin of forehead left, unless there is a great deal of repetition....\r\nThe record (not the prophecy) of the inner life, though it is\r\nhieroglyphed on the whole face too, is a scant one; not because there is\r\nbut little to record, but because only results are chronicled. Like the\r\n_Veni, vidi, vici_, of Cæsar. _Veni_; nothing of the weary march.\r\n_Vidi_; nothing of the doubts, fears, and anxieties. _Vici_; nothing of\r\nthe fierce struggle.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain; though we can not read the divine imprint on the\r\nforehead, we know that either there or on the face, either as prophecy\r\nor record, is written, _grief_. Grief, the burden of the sadly-beautiful\r\nsong of the poet; yet we find, alas! that _grief is grief_. And the\r\npoet's woe is also the woe of common mortals, though his soul is so\r\nstrung that every breeze that sweeps over it is changed to melody. The\r\nwind that wails, and howls, and shrieks around the corners of streets,\r\namong the leafless branches of trees, through desolate houses, is the\r\nsame wind that sweeps the silken strings of the Æolian harp.\r\n\r\nThen there is _care_, most often traced on the face of woman, the care\r\nof responsibility or of work, sometimes of both. A man, however hard he\r\nmay labor, if he loses a day, does not always find an accumulation of\r\nwork; but with poor, over-worked woman, it is, work or be overwhelmed\r\nwith work, as in the punishment of prisoners, it is, pump or drown. I\r\ncan not understand how women do get along who, with the family of John\r\nRogers' wife, assisted only by the eldest daughter, a girl of thirteen,\r\nwash, iron, bake, cook, wash dishes, and sew for the family, coats and\r\npantaloons included, and that too without the help of a machine. Oh!\r\nthat pile of sewing always cut out, to be leveled stitch by stitch; for,\r\nunlike water, it never will find its own level, unless its level be Mont\r\nBlanc, for to such a hight it would reach if left to itself. I could\r\ngrow eloquent on the subject, but forbear.\r\n\r\nCroakers to the contrary notwithstanding, there is in the record of our\r\npast lives, or in the prophecy of our future, another word than _grief_\r\nor _care_; it is _joy_. My friend, could your history be truthfully\r\nwritten, and printed in the old style, are there not many passages that\r\nwould shine beautifully in golden letters? I say truthfully written; for\r\nwe are so apt to forget our joys, while we remember our griefs. Perhaps\r\nthis is because joy and its effects are so evanescent. Leland talks\r\nbeautifully of 'the perfumed depths of the lotus-word, _joyousness_;'\r\nbut in this world we only breathe the perfume. Could we eat the\r\nlotus!... The fabled lotus-eater wished never to leave the isle whence\r\nhe had plucked it. Wrapped in dreamy selfishness, unnerved for the toil\r\nof reaching the far-off shore, he grew indifferent to country and\r\nfriends.... So earth would be to us an enchanted isle. The stern toil by\r\nwhich we are to reach that better land, our _home_, would become irksome\r\nto us. It is well for us that we can only breathe the perfume.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the deepest woe we may know--not the highest joy--that is\r\nbliss beyond even our capacity of dreaming. Some one, in regard to the\r\nladder Jacob saw in his dream, says: 'But alas! he slept at the foot.'\r\nThat any ladder should be substantial enough for cumbersome mortality to\r\nclimb to heaven, was too great an impossibility even for a dream.\r\n\r\nBut read for yourself the faces that swirl through the streets of a\r\ncity. Now and then there is one on which the results of all evil\r\npassions are traced. Were it not for the _brute_ in it, it might be\r\nmistaken for the face of a fiend. Though such are few, too many bear the\r\nimpress of at least one evil passion. Every passion, unbitted and\r\nunbridled, hurries the soul bound to it--as Mazeppa was bound to the\r\nwild horse--to certain destruction.... But I--as all things hasten to\r\nthe end--will mention one word more--the _finis_ of the prophecy--the\r\n_stamp on the seal_ of the record--_Death_.... We will not dwell on it.\r\nWho more than glances at the _finis_, who studies the plain word stamped\r\non the seal?\r\n\r\nYours, MOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nI have read of a young Indian girl, disguised as her lover, whom she had\r\nassisted to escape from captivity, fleeing from her pursuers, till she\r\nreached the brink of a deep ravine; before her is a perpendicular wall\r\nof rock; behind, the foe, so near that she can hear the crackling of the\r\ndry branches under their tread; yet nearer they come; she almost feels\r\ntheir breath on her cheek; it is useless to turn at bay; there is hardly\r\ntime to measure with her eye the depth of the ravine, or its width. A\r\nstep back, another forward, an almost superhuman leap, and she has\r\ncleared the awful chasm.... 'Look before you leap,' is one of caution's\r\nmaxims. We may stand looking till it is too late to leap. There are\r\ntimes when we _must_ put our 'fate to the touch, to win or lose it all;'\r\nthere are times when doubt, hesitation, caution is certain destruction.\r\nYou are crossing a frozen pond, firm by the shore, but as you near the\r\ncentre, the ice beneath your feet begins to crack; hesitate, attempt to\r\nretrace your steps, and you are gone. Did you ever cross a rapid stream\r\non an unhewn foot-log? You looked down at the swift current, stopped,\r\nturned back, and over you went. You would climb a steep mountain-side.\r\nHalf-way up, look not from the dizzy hight, but press on, grasping every\r\ntough laurel and bare root; but hasten, the laurel may break, and you\r\nlose your footing. 'If thy heart fail thee, climb not at all;' but once\r\nresolved to climb, leave thy caution at the foot. Before you give battle\r\nto the enemy, be cautious, reckon well your chances of winning or\r\nlosing; above all, be sure of the justice of your cause; but once flung\r\ninto the fierce fight, then with _'Dieu et mon droit!'_ for your\r\nbattle-cry, let not 'discretion' be _any_ 'part of' your 'valor.'\r\n\r\nThen your careful, hesitating people are cautious where there is no need\r\nof caution, they feel their way on the highways and by-ways of life, as\r\nyou have seen a person when fording a stream with whose bed he was\r\nunacquainted. I'd rather fall down and pick myself up a dozen times a\r\nday, than thus grope my way along.\r\n\r\nThere is Nancy Primrose. I have good reason to remember her. She was, in\r\nmy childhood, always held up to me as a pattern. She used to come to\r\nschool with such smooth, clean pantalets, while mine were splashed with\r\nmud, drabbled by the wet grass, or all wrinkles from having been rolled\r\nup. She would go around a rod to avoid a mud-puddle, or if she availed\r\nherself of the board laid down for the benefit of pedestrians, she\r\nnever, as I was sure to do, stepped on one end, so the other came down\r\nwith a splash. The starch never was taken out of her sun-bonnet by the\r\nrain, for if there was 'a cloud as big as a man's hand,' she took an\r\numbrella. It was well that she never climbed the mountain-side, for she\r\nwould have surely fallen. It was well that she never crossed a foot-log,\r\nunless it was hewn and had a railing, for she would have certainly been\r\nducked. It was well she never went on thin ice, (she didn't venture till\r\nthe other girls had tried it,) she would have broken through. Her\r\ncaution, I must say, was of the right kind; it always preceded her\r\nundertaking. She had such a 'wholesome fear of consequences,' that she\r\nnever played truant, as one whom I could mention did. Indeed,\r\nantecedents and consequents were always associated in her mind. She\r\nnever risked any thing for herself or any one else.... Of course, she is\r\nstill _Miss_ Nancy, (I am 'Aunt Molly' to all my friends' children,)\r\nthough it is said that she might have been Mrs.----. Mr.----, a widower\r\nof some six months' standing, thinking it time to commence his\r\nprobation--the engagement preparatory to being received into the full\r\nmatrimonial connection--made some advances toward Miss Nancy, she being\r\nthe nearest one verging on 'an uncertain age,' (you know widowers\r\nalways go the rounds of the old maids.) Though, in a worldly point of\r\nview, he was an eligible match, she, from her fixed habits of caution,\r\nhalf-hesitated as to whether it was best to receive his attentions--he\r\ngot in a hurry (you know widowers are always in a hurry) and married\r\nsome one else.... I don't think Miss Nancy would venture to love any man\r\nbefore marriage--engagements are as liable to be broken as thin ice, and\r\nit isn't best to throw away love. As for her giving it unasked!... How\r\npeacefully her life flows along--or rather, it hardly flows at all,\r\nabout as much as a mill-pond--with such a small bit of heaven and earth\r\nreflected in it. Oh! that placidity!--better have some great, heavy,\r\nsplashing sorrow thrown into it than that ever calm surface.... As for\r\nme--it was a good thing that I was a girl--rash, never counting the\r\ncost, without caution, it is well that I have to tread the quiet paths\r\nof domestic life. Had I been a boy, thrown out into the rough, dangerous\r\nworld, I'd have rushed over the first precipice, breaking my moral, or\r\nphysical neck, or both. As it is, had I been like Miss Nancy, I would\r\nhave been spared many an agony, and--many an exquisite joy.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure that I have well learned all of caution's maxims; they\r\nhave, all my life, been dinged into my ears. Now I hate most maxims.\r\nThough generally considered epitomes of wisdom, they should, almost all\r\nof them, be received with a qualification. What is true in one case is\r\nnot true in another; what is good for one, is not good for another. You,\r\nas far as you are concerned, in exactly the same manner draw two lines,\r\none on a plane, the other on a sphere; one line will be straight, the\r\nother curved. So does every truth, even, make a different mark on\r\ndifferent minds. This is one reason that I hate most maxims, they never\r\naccommodate themselves to circumstances or individuals. The maxim that\r\nwould make one man a careful economist, would make another a miser. 'One\r\nman's meat is another man's poison;' one man's truth is another man's\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nBut how many mistaken ideas have been embodied in maxims--fossilized, I\r\nmay say! It would have been better to let them die the natural death of\r\nfalsehood, and they might have sprung up in new forms of truth--truth\r\nthat never dies. What a vitality it has--a vitality that can not be\r\ndried out by time, nor crushed out by violence. You know how in old\r\nmummy-cases have been found grains of wheat, which, being sown, sprang\r\nup, and bore a harvest like that which waved in the breeze on the banks\r\nof the Nile. You know how God's truth--all truth is God's truth--was\r\nshut up in that old mummy-case, the monastery, and how, when found by\r\none Luther, and sown broadcast, it sprang up, and now there is hardly an\r\nisland, or a river's bank, on which it has not fallen and does not bear\r\nabundant fruit. The 'heel of despotism' could not crush out its life;\r\nages hence it will be said of it: 'It still lives.'\r\n\r\nAnd still lives, yours,\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'THAT LAST DITCH.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMany reasons have been assigned for the _Chivalry's_ determining to die\r\nin that last ditch. One William Shakspeare puts into the mouth of\r\nEnobarbus, in _Antony and Cleopatra_, the best reason we have yet seen.\r\n'Tis thus:\r\n\r\n                               'I will go seek\r\n  Some ditch wherein to die: THE FOUL BEST FITS\r\n  MY LATTER PART OF LIFE.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPEFUL TACKETT--HIS MARK.\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD WOLCOTT, 'TENTH ILLINOIS.'\r\n\r\n\r\n  'An' the Star-Spangle' Banger in triump' shall wave\r\n  O! the lan dov the free-e-e, an' the ho mov the brave.'\r\n\r\nThus sang Hopeful Tackett, as he sat on his little bench in the little\r\nshop of Herr Kordwäner, the village shoemaker. Thus he sang, not\r\nartistically, but with much fervor and unction, keeping time with his\r\nhammer, as he hammered away at an immense 'stoga.' And as he sang, the\r\nprophetic words rose upon the air, and were wafted, together with an\r\nodor of new leather and paste-pot, out of the window, and fell upon the\r\near of a ragged urchin with an armful of hand-bills.\r\n\r\n'Would you lose a leg for it, Hope?' he asked, bringing to bear upon\r\nHopeful a pair of crossed eyes, a full complement of white teeth, and a\r\nface promiscuously spotted with its kindred dust.\r\n\r\n'For the Banger?' replied Hopeful; 'guess I would. Both on 'em--an' a\r\nhead, too.'\r\n\r\n'Well, here's a chance for you.' And he tossed him a hand-bill.\r\n\r\nHopeful laid aside his hammer and his work, and picked up the hand-bill;\r\nand while he is reading it, let us briefly describe him. Hopeful is not\r\na beauty, and he knows it; and though some of the rustic wits call him\r\n'Beaut,' he is well aware that they intend it for irony. His countenance\r\nruns too much to nose--rude, amorphous nose at that--to be classic, and\r\nis withal rugged in general outline and pimply in spots. His hair is\r\ndecidedly too dingy a red to be called, even by the utmost stretch of\r\ncourtesy, auburn; dry, coarse, and pertinaciously obstinate in its\r\nresistance to the civilizing efforts of comb and brush. But there is a\r\ngreat deal of big bone and muscle in him, and he may yet work out a\r\nnoble destiny. Let us see.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had spelled out the hand-bill, and found that\r\nLieutenant ---- was in town and wished to enlist recruits for\r\nCompany ----, ---- Regiment, it was nearly sunset; and he took off his\r\napron, washed his hands, looked at himself in the piece of looking-glass\r\nthat stuck in the window--a defiant look, that said that he was not\r\nafraid of all that nose--took his hat down from its peg behind the door,\r\nand in spite of the bristling resistance of his hair, crowded it down\r\nover his head, and started for his supper. And as he walked he mused\r\naloud, as was his custom, addressing himself in the second person,\r\n'Hopeful, what do you think of it? They want more soldiers, eh? Guess\r\nthem fights at Donelson and Pittsburg Lannen 'bout used up some o' them\r\nridgiments. By Jing!' (Hopeful had been piously brought up, and his\r\nemphatic exclamations took a mild form.) 'Hopeful, 'xpect you'll have to\r\ngo an' stan' in some poor feller's shoes. 'Twon't do for them there\r\nblasted Seceshers to be killin' off our boys, an' no one there to pay\r\n'em back. It's time this here thing was busted! Hopeful, you an't\r\npretty, an' you an't smart; but you used to be a mighty nasty hand with\r\na shot-gun. Guess you'll have to try your hand on old Borey's\r\n[Beauregard's] chaps; an' if you ever git a bead on one, he'll enter his\r\nland mighty shortly. What do you say to goin'? You wanted to go last\r\nyear, but mother was sick, an' you couldn't; and now mother's gone to\r\nglory, why, show your grit an' go. Think about it, any how.'\r\n\r\nAnd Hopeful did think about it--thought till late at night of the\r\ninsulted flag, of the fierce fights and glorious victories, of the dead\r\nand the dying lying out in the pitiless storm, of the dastardly outrages\r\nof rebel fiends--thought of all this, with his great warm heart\r\noverflowing with love for the dear old 'Banger,' and resolved to go.\r\nThe next morning, he notified his 'boss' of his intention to quit his\r\nservice for that of Uncle Sam. The old fellow only opened his eyes very\r\nwide, grunted, brought out the stocking, (a striped relic of the\r\ndeparted Frau Kordwäner,) and from it counted out and paid Hopeful every\r\ncent that was due him. But there was one thing that sat heavily upon\r\nHopeful's mind. He was in a predicament that all of us are liable to\r\nfall into--he was in love, and with Christina, Herr Kordwäner's\r\ndaughter. Christina was a plump maiden, with a round, rosy face, an\r\nextensive latitude of shoulders, and a general plentitude and solidity\r\nof figure. All these she had; but what had captivated Hopeful's eye was\r\nher trim ankle, as it had appeared to him one morning, encased in a warm\r\nwhite yarn stocking of her own knitting. From this small beginning, his\r\ngreat heart had taken in the whole of her, and now he was desperately in\r\nlove. Two or three times he had essayed to tell her of his proposed\r\ndeparture; but every time that the words were coming to his lips,\r\nsomething rushed up into his throat ahead of them, and he couldn't\r\nspeak. At last, after walking home from church with her on Sunday\r\nevening, he held out his hand and blurted out:\r\n\r\n'Well, good-by. We're off to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Off! Where?'\r\n\r\n'I've enlisted.'\r\n\r\nChristina didn't faint. She didn't take out her delicate and daintily\r\nperfumed _mouchoir_, to hide the tears that were not there. She looked\r\nat him for a moment, while two great _real_ tears rolled down her\r\ncheeks, and then--precipitated all her charms right into his arms.\r\nHopeful stood it manfully--rather liked it, in fact. But this is a\r\ntableau that we've no right to be looking at; so let us pass by how they\r\nparted--with what tears and embraces, and extravagant protestations of\r\nundying affection, and wild promises of eternal remembrance; there is no\r\nneed of telling, for we all know how foolish young people will be under\r\nsuch circumstances. We older heads know all about such little matters,\r\nand what they amount to. Oh! yes, certainly we do.\r\n\r\nThe next morning found Hopeful, with a dozen others, in charge of the\r\nlieutenant, and on their way to join the regiment. Hopeful's first\r\nexperience of camp-life was not a singular one. He, like the rest of us,\r\nat first exhibited the most energetic awkwardness in drilling. Like the\r\nrest of us, he had occasional attacks of home-sickness; and as he stood\r\nat his post on picket in the silent night-watches, while the camps lay\r\nquietly sleeping in the moonlight, his thoughts would go back to his\r\nfar-away home, and the little shop, and the plentiful charms of the\r\nfair-haired Christina. So he went on, dreaming sweet dreams of home, but\r\never active and alert, eager to learn and earnest to do his duty,\r\nsilencing all selfish suggestions of his heart with the simple logic of\r\na pure patriotism.\r\n\r\n'Hopeful,' he would say, 'the Banger's took care o' you all your life,\r\nan' now you're here to take care of it. See that you do it the best you\r\nknow how.'\r\n\r\nIt would be more thrilling and interesting, and would read better, if we\r\ncould take our hero to glory amid the roar of cannon and muskets,\r\nthrough a storm of shot and shell, over a serried line of glistening\r\nbayonets. But strict truth--a matter of which newspaper correspondents,\r\nand sensational writers, generally seem to have a very misty\r\nconception--forbids it.\r\n\r\nIt was only a skirmish--a bush-whacking fight for the possession of a\r\nswamp. A few companies were deployed as skirmishers, to drive out the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n'Now, boys,' shouted the captain, 'after'em! Shoot to kill, not to scare\r\n'em!'\r\n\r\n'Ping! ping!' rang the rifles.\r\n\r\n'Z-z-z-z-vit!' sang the bullets.\r\n\r\nOn they went, crouching among the bushes, creeping along under the banks\r\nof the brook, cautiously peering from behind trees in search of\r\n'butternuts.'\r\n\r\nHopeful was in the advance; his hat was lost, and his hair more\r\ndefiantly bristling than ever. Firmly grasping his rifle, he pushed on,\r\ncarefully watching every tree and bush, A rebel sharp-shooter started to\r\nrun from one tree to another, when, quick as thought, Hopeful's rifle\r\nwas at his shoulder, a puff of blue smoke rose from its mouth, and the\r\nrebel sprang into the air and fell back--dead. Almost at the same\r\ninstant, as Hopeful leaned forward to see the effect of his shot, he\r\nfelt a sudden shock, a sharp, burning pain, grasped at a bush, reeled,\r\nand sank to the ground.\r\n\r\n'Are you hurt much, Hope?' asked one of his comrades, kneeling beside\r\nhim and staunching the blood that flowed from his wounded leg.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I expect I am; but that red wamus over yonder's redder 'n ever\r\nnow. That feller won't need a pension.'\r\n\r\nThey carried him back to the hospital, and the old surgeon looked at the\r\nwound, shook his head, and briefly made his prognosis.\r\n\r\n'Bone shattered--vessels injured--bad leg--have to come off. Good\r\nconstitution, though; he'll stand it.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did stand it; always cheerful, never complaining, only,\r\nregretting that he must be discharged--that he was no longer able to\r\nserve his country.\r\n\r\nAnd now Hopeful is again sitting on his little bench in Mynheer\r\nKordwäner's little shop, pegging away at the coarse boots, singing the\r\nsame glorious prophecy that we first heard him singing. He has had but\r\ntwo troubles since his return. One is the lingering regret and\r\nrestlessness that attends a civil life after an experience of the rough,\r\nindependent life in camp. The other trouble was when he first saw\r\nChristina after his return. The loving warmth with which she greeted him\r\npained him; and when the worthy Herr considerately went out of the room,\r\nleaving them alone, he relapsed into gloomy silence. At length, speaking\r\nrapidly, and with choked utterance, he began:\r\n\r\n'Christie, you know I love you now, as I always have, better 'n all the\r\nworld. But I'm a cripple now--no account to nobody--just a dead\r\nweight--an' I don't want you, 'cause o' your promise before I went away,\r\nto tie yourself to a load that'll be a drag on you all your life. That\r\ncontract--ah--promises--an't--is--is hereby repealed! There!' And he\r\nleaned his head upon his hands and wept bitter tears, wrung by a great\r\nagony from his loving heart.\r\n\r\nChristie gently laid her hand upon his shoulder, and spoke, slowly and\r\ncalmly: 'Hopeful, your soul was not in that leg, was it?'\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if Hopeful had always thought that such was the case,\r\nand was just receiving new light upon the subject, he started up so\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n'By jing! Christie!' And he grasped her hand, and--but that is another\r\nof those scenes that don't concern us at all. And Christie has promised\r\nnext Christmas to take the name, as she already has the heart, of\r\nTackett. Herr Kordwäner, too, has come to the conclusion that he wants a\r\npartner, and on the day of the wedding a new sign is to be put up over a\r\nnew and larger shop, on which 'Co.' will mean Hopeful Tackett. In the\r\nmean time, Hopeful hammers away lustily, merrily whistling, and singing\r\nthe praises of the 'Banger.' Occasionally, when he is resting, he will\r\ntenderly embrace his stump of a leg, gently patting and stroking it, and\r\ntalking to it as to a pet. If a stranger is in the shop, he will hold it\r\nout admiringly, and ask:\r\n\r\n'Do you know what I call that? I call that _'Hopeful Tackett--his\r\nmark.'_'\r\n\r\nAnd it is a mark--a mark of distinction--a badge of honor, worn by many\r\na brave fellow who has gone forth, borne and upheld by a love for the\r\ndear old flag, to fight, to suffer, to die if need be, for it; won in\r\nthe fierce contest, amid the clashing strokes of the steel and the wild\r\nwhistling of bullets; won by unflinching nerve and unyielding muscle;\r\nworn as a badge of the proudest distinction an American can reach. If\r\nthese lines come to one of those that have thus fought and\r\nsuffered--though his scars were received in some unnoticed, unpublished\r\nskirmish, though official bulletins spoke not of him, 'though fame\r\nshall never know his story'--let them come as a tribute to him; as a\r\ntoken that he is not forgotten; that those that have been with him\r\nthrough the trials and the triumphs of the field, remember him and the\r\nheroic courage that won for him by those honorable scars; and that while\r\nlife is left to them they will work and fight in the same cause,\r\ncheerfully making the same sacrifices, seeking no higher reward than to\r\ntake him by the hand and call him 'comrade,' and to share with him the\r\nproud consciousness of duty done. Shoulder-straps and stars may bring\r\nrenown; but he is no less a real hero who, with rifle and bayonet,\r\nthrows himself into the breach, and, uninspired by hope of official\r\nnotice, battles manfully for the right.\r\n\r\nHopeful Tackett, humble yet illustrious, a hero for all time, we salute\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL TO JONATHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  You grow too fast, my child!

Commencement, with its dazzling\r\nexcitement, its galleries of fair faces to smile and approve, its\r\ngathered wisdom to listen and adjudge, was no longer the goal of our\r\nstudent-hopes; and the terrible realization that our joyous college-days\r\nwere over, now pressed hard upon us as we paced slowly along, listening\r\nto the low night wind among the summer leaves overhead, or looking up at\r\nthe darkened windows whence the laugh and song of class-mates had so oft\r\nresounded to vex with mirth the drowsy ear of night--and tutors. I\r\nthought then, as I have often thought since, that our student-life must\r\nbe 'the golden prime' compared with which all coming time would be as\r\nsilver, brass, or iron. Here youth with its keenness of enjoyment and\r\ngenerous heartiness; freedom from care, smooth-browed and mirthful;\r\nliberal studies refining and elevating withal; the Numbers, whose ready\r\nsympathy had divided sorrow and multiplied joy, were associated as they\r\nnever could be again; and so I doubt not many a one has felt as he stood\r\nat the door of academic life and looked away over its sunny meadows to\r\nthe dark woodlands and rugged hillsides of world-life. How throbbed in\r\nold days the wandering student's heart as on the distant hill-top he\r\nturned to take a last look at disappearing Bologna and remembered the\r\nfair curtain-lecturing Novella de Andrea[1]--fair prototype of modern\r\nMrs. Caudle; how his spirits rose when, like Lucentio, he came to 'fair\r\nPadua, nursery of arts;' or how he mused for the last time wandering\r\nbeside the turbid Arno, in\r\n\r\n  'Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,'\r\n\r\nwe wot not. Little do we know either of the ancient 'larks' of the\r\nSorbonne, of Leyden, Utrecht, and Amsterdam; somewhat less, in spite of\r\ngifted imagining, of _The Student of Salamanca_. But Howitt's _Student\r\nLife in Germany_, setting forth in all its noisy, smoking, beer-drinking\r\nconviviality the significance of the Burschenleben,\r\n\r\n  'I am an unmarried scholar and a free man;'\r\n\r\nBristed's _Five Years in an English University_, congenial in its\r\nsetting forth of the Cantab's carnal delights and intellectual\r\njockeyism; _The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman_,\r\nwherein one 'Cuthbert Bede, B.A.' has by 'numerous illustrations' of\r\nnumerous dissipations, given as good an idea as is desirable of the\r\n'rowing men' in that very antediluvian receptacle of elegant\r\nscholarship; are all present evidences of the affectionate interest with\r\nwhich the graduate reverts to his college days. In like manner _Student\r\nLife in Scotland_ has engaged the late attention of venerable\r\n_Blackwood_, while the pages of _Putnam_, in _Life in a Canadian\r\nCollege_,[2] and _Fireside Travels_,[3] have given some idea of things\r\nnearer home, some little time ago. But while numerous pamphlets and\r\nessays have been written on our collegiate systems of education, the\r\ngeneral development and present doings of Young America in the\r\nuniversities remain untouched.\r\n\r\nThe academic influences exerted over American students are, it must be\r\npremised, vastly different from those of the old world. Imprimis, our\r\ncolleges are just well into being. Reaching back into no dim antiquity,\r\ntheir rise and progress are traceable from their beginnings--beginnings\r\nnot always the greatest. Thus saith the poet doctor of his Alma Mater:\r\n\r\n  'Pray, who was on the Catalogue\r\n    When college was begun?\r\n  Two nephews of the President,\r\n    And _the_ Professor's son,\r\n  (They turned a little Indian by,\r\n    As brown as any bun;)\r\n  Lord! how the Seniors knocked about\r\n    That Freshman class of one!'\r\n\r\nFrom small beginnings and short lives our colleges have gathered neither\r\nthat momentum of years heavy with mighty names and weighty memories, nor\r\nof wealth heaping massive piles and drawing within their cloistered\r\nwalls the learning of successive centuries which carries the European\r\nuniversities crashing down the ages, though often heavy laden with the\r\ndead forms of mediæval preciseness. No established church makes with\r\nthem common cause, no favoring and influential aristocracy gives them\r\nthe careless security of a complete protection. Their development thus\r\nfar has been under very different influences. Founded in the wilderness\r\nby our English ancestors, they were, at first, it is true, in their\r\ncourse of study and in foolish formula of ceremony an imperfect copy of\r\ntrans-Atlantic originals. Starting from this point, their course has\r\nbeen shaped according to the peculiar genius of our institutions and\r\npeople. Republican feeling has dispensed with the monastic dress, the\r\nservile demeanor toward superiors, and the ceremonious forms which had\r\nlost their significance. The peculiar wants of a new country have\r\nrequired not high scholarship, but more practical learning to meet\r\npressing physical wants. Again, our numerous religious sects requiring\r\neach a nursery of its own children, and the great extent of our country,\r\nhave called, or seemed to call (in spite of continually increasing\r\nfacility of intercourse) for some one hundred and twenty colleges within\r\nour borders. Add to this a demand not peculiar but general--the\r\nincreased claim of the sciences and of modern languages upon our\r\nregard--and the accompanying fallacy of supposing Latin and Greek\r\nheathenish and useless, and we have a summary view of the influences\r\nbearing upon our literary institutions. Hence both good and evil have\r\narisen. Our colleges easily conforming in their youthful and supple\r\nenergy, have met the demands of the age. They have thrown aside their\r\nmonastic gowns and quadrangular caps. They have in good degree given up\r\nthe pedantic follies of Latin versification and Hebrew orations. Their\r\nwalls have arisen alike in populous city and lonely hamlet, and in\r\npoverty and insignificance they have been content could they give depth\r\nand breadth to any small portion of the national mind. They have\r\nconceded to Science the place which her rapid and brilliant progress\r\ndemanded. On the other hand, however, we see long and well-proven\r\nsystems of education profaned by the ignorant hands of superficial\r\nreformers. We see the colleges themselves dragging on a precarious life,\r\nyet less revered than cherished by fostering sects, and more hooted at\r\nby the advocates of potato-digging and other practical pursuits, than\r\ndefended by their legitimate protectors. It is not to be denied that\r\nthere is a powerful element of Materialism among us, and that too often\r\nwe neither appreciate nor respect the earnest, abstruse scholar. The\r\nprogress of humanity must be shouted in popular catch-words from the\r\nhouse-tops, and the noisy herald appropriates the laudation of him who\r\nin pain and weariness traced the hidden truth. We hear men of enlarged\r\nthought and lofty views derided as old fogies because beyond unassisted\r\nappreciation, until we are half-tempted to believe the generation to be\r\nmultiplied Ephraims given to their idols, who had best be let alone.\r\n\r\nThe American student, under these influences, differs somewhat from his\r\nEuropean brethren. He is younger by two or three years. Though generally\r\nfrom the better class, he is more, perhaps, identified with the mass of\r\nthe people, and is more of a politician than a scholar. His remarks upon\r\nthe Homeric dialects, however laudatory, are most suspiciously vague,\r\nand though he escape such slight errors as describing the Gracchi as a\r\nbarbarous tribe in the north of Italy or the Piræus as a meat-market of\r\nAthens, you must beware of his classical allusions. On the other hand he\r\nis more moral, a more independent thinker and a freer man than his\r\nprototype across the sea. His fault is, as Bristed says, that he is\r\nsuperficial; his virtue, that he is straightforward and earnest in\r\naiming at practical life.\r\n\r\nSuch may suffice for a few general remarks. But some memories of one of\r\nour most important universities will better set forth the habits and\r\ncustoms of the joyous student-life than farther wearisome generality.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant days are gone that I dreamed away beneath the green arcades\r\nof the fair Elm City. But still come the budding spring and the blooming\r\nsummer to embower those quiet streets and to fill the morning hour with\r\nbirds' sweet singing. Still comes the gorgeous autumn--the dead summer\r\nlain in state--and the cloud-robed winter to round the circling year.\r\nStill streams the golden sunlight through the green canopies of tented\r\nelms, and still, I ween, do pretty school-girls (feminine of student)\r\nloiter away in flirting fascination the holiday afternoons beneath their\r\nshade. Still do our memories haunt those old walks we loved so well: the\r\navenue shaded and silent like grove of Academe, fit residence of\r\ncolloquial man of science or genial metaphysician; the old cemetery with\r\nits brown ivy-grown wall, its dark, massive evergreens, and moss-grown\r\nstones, that, before years had effaced the inscription, told the mortal\r\nstory of early settler; elm-arched Temple street, where the midnight\r\nmoon shone so softly through the dark masses of foliage and slept so\r\nsweetly on the sloping green. Still do those old wharves and\r\nwarehouses--ancient haunts of colonial commerce and scenes of\r\ncontinental struggle--rest there in dusty quiet, hearing but murmurs of\r\nthe noisy merchant-world without; and the fair bay lies silent among\r\nthose green hills that slope southward to the Sound. Methinks I hear the\r\nripple of its moonlit waves as in the summer night it upbore our gallant\r\nboat and its fair freight; the far-off music stealing o'er the bright\r\nwaters; the distant rattling of some paid-out cable as a newly arrived\r\nbark anchors down the bay; or the lonely baying of a watch-dog at some\r\nfarm-house on the hight. I see the sail-boats bending under their canvas\r\nand dashing the salt spray from their bows as they rush through the\r\nsmooth water, and the oyster-boats cleaving the clear brine like an\r\narrow, bound for Fair Haven, of many shell-fish; while sturdy sloops and\r\nschooners--suggestive of lobsters or pineapples--bow their big heads\r\nmeekly and sway themselves at rest. I see again those long lines of\r\ngreen-wooded slope, here crowned by a lonely farm-house musing solitary\r\non the hills as it looks off on the blue Sound, there ending abruptly in\r\na weather-worn cliff of splintered trap, or anon bringing down some\r\narable acres to the very beach, where a gray old cottage, kept in\r\ncountenance by two or three rugged poplars, like the fisher's hut,\r\n\r\n  'In der blauen Fluth sich beschaut.'\r\n\r\nNor can I soon forget those wild hillsides, so glorious both when the\r\nsummer floods of foliage came pouring down their sides, and when autumn,\r\nfavorite child of the year, donned his coat of many colors and came\r\nforth to join his brethren. Then, on holiday-afternoon, free from\r\nstudent-care, we climbed the East or West Rock, and looked abroad over\r\nthe distant city-spires, rock-ribbed hillside and sail-dotted sea; or\r\nthreading the devious path to the Judges' Cave, where tradition said\r\nthat in colonial times the regicides, Goffe and Whalley, lay hidden,\r\nread on the lone rock that in the winter wilderness overhung their bleak\r\nhiding-place, in an old inscription carved not without pain, in quaint\r\nletters of other years, the stern and stirring old watchword:\r\n\r\n\r\n'RESISTANCE TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD.'\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, going further, we climbed Mount Carmel, and looked from its steep\r\ncliff down into the solitary rock-strewn valley--\r\n\r\n  'Where storm and lightning from that huge gray wall,\r\n  Had tumbled down vast blocks, and at the base\r\n  Dashed them in fragments.'\r\n\r\nOr went on to the Cheshire hillside, where the Roaring Brook, tumbling\r\ndown the steep ravine, flashed its clear waters into whitest foam, and\r\nveiled the unsightly rocks with its snowy spray; or, perchance, in\r\ncumbrous boat, floated upon Lake Saltonstall, hermit of ponds, set like\r\na liquid crystal in the emerald hills--an eyesore to luckless piscatory\r\nstudents, but highly favored of all lovers of ice, whether applied to\r\nthe bottoms of ringing High Dutchers, or internally in shape of summer\r\nrefrigerators.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these pleasant haunts and this fair city, lies a sloping\r\ngreen of twenty or twenty-five acres, girt and bisected by rows of huge\r\nelms, and planted with three churches, whose spires glisten above the\r\ntall trees, and with a stuccoed State House, whose peeled columns and\r\ncrumbling steps are more beautiful in conception than execution. On the\r\nupper side, looking down across, stretched out in a long line of eight\r\nhundred feet, the buildings of the college stand, in dense shade. Ugly\r\nbarracks, four stories high, built of red brick, without a line of\r\nbeautifying architecture, they yet have an ancient air of repose, buried\r\nthere in the deep shade, that pleases even the fastidious eye. In the\r\nrear, an old laboratory, diverted from its original gastronomic purpose\r\nof hall, which in our American colleges has dispensed with commons, a\r\ncabinet, similarly metamorphosed, and containing some magnificent\r\nspecimens of the New World's minerals; a gallery of portraits of\r\ncollege, colonial and revolutionary worthies--a collection of rare\r\nhistorical interest; a Gothic pile of library, built of brown sandstone,\r\nits slender towers crowned with grinning, uncouth heads, cut in stone,\r\nwhich are pointed out to incipient Freshmen as busts of members of the\r\ncollege faculty; and a castellated Gothic structure of like material,\r\noccupied by the two ancient literary fraternities, and notable toward\r\nthe close of the academic year as the place where isolated Sophomores\r\nand Seniors write down the results of two years' study in the Biennial\r\nExamination--make up the incongruous whole of the college proper.\r\n\r\nSuch is the place where, about the middle of September, if you have been\r\nsojourning through the very quiet vacation in one of the almost deserted\r\nhotels of New-Haven, you will begin to be conscious of an awakening from\r\nthe six weeks' torpor, (the _long_ vacation of hurried Americans who\r\nmust study forty weeks of the year.) Along the extended row of brick you\r\nwill begin to discern aproned 'sweeps' clearing the month and a half's\r\naccumulated rubbish from the walks, beating carpets on the grass-plots,\r\nre-lining with new fire-brick the sheet-iron cylinder-stoves, more\r\nfamous for their eminent Professor improver (may his shadow never be\r\nless!) than for their heating qualities, or furbishing old furniture\r\npurchased at incredibly low prices, of the last class, to make good as\r\nnew for the Freshmen, periphrastically known as 'the young gentlemen who\r\nhave lately entered college.' It may be, too, that your practiced eye\r\nwill detect one of these fearful youths, who, coming from a thousand\r\nmiles in the interior--from the prairies of the West or the bayous of\r\nthe South--has arrived before his time, and now, blushing unseen, is\r\nreconnoitering the intellectual fortress which he hopes soon to storm\r\nwith 'small Latin and less Greek,' or, perchance, remembering with sad\r\nface the distance of his old home and the strangeness of the new. A few\r\ndays more, and hackmen drive down Chapel street hopefully, and return\r\nwith trunks and carpet-bags outside and diversified specimens of\r\nstudent-humanity within--a Freshman, in spite of his efforts, showing\r\nthat his as yet undeveloped character is '_summâ integritate et\r\ninnocentiâ_;' a Sophomore, somewhat flashy and bad-hatted, a _hard_\r\nstudent in the worse sense, with much of the '_fortiter in re_' in his\r\nbearing; a Junior, exhibiting the antithetical '_suaviter in modo_;' a\r\nSenior, whose '_otium cum dignitate_' at once distinguishes him from the\r\nvulgar herd of common mortals. Then succeed hearty greetings of meeting\r\nfriends, great purchase of text-books, and much changing of rooms;\r\nstudents being migratory by nature, and stimulated thereto by the\r\nprospect of choice of better rooms conceded to advanced academical\r\nstanding. In which state of things the various employés of college,\r\nincluding the trusty colored Aquarius, facetiously denominated Professor\r\n_Paley_, under the excitement of numerous quarters, greatly multiply\r\ntheir efforts.\r\n\r\nBut the chief interest of the opening year is clustered around the class\r\nabout to unite its destinies with the college-world. A new century of\r\nstudents--\r\n\r\n  'The igneous men of Georgia,\r\n  The ligneous men of Maine,'\r\n\r\nthe rough, energetic Westerner, the refined, lethargic metropolitan,\r\nwith here and there a missionary's son from the Golden Horn or the isles\r\nof the Pacific or even a Chinese, long-queued and meta-physical, are to\r\nbe divided between the two rival literary Societies.[4] These having\r\nduring the last term with great excitement elected their officers for\r\nthe coming 'campaign,' and held numerous 'indignation meetings,' where\r\nhostile speeches and inquiries into the numbers to be sent down by the\r\nvarious academies were diligently prosecuted to the great neglect of\r\ndebates and essays, now join issue with an adroitness on the part of\r\ntheir respective members which gives great promise for political life.\r\nCommittees at the station-house await the arrival of every train, accost\r\nevery individual of right age and verdancy; and, having ascertained that\r\nhe is not a city clerk nor a graduate, relapsed into his ante-academic\r\nstate, offer their services as amateur porters, guides, or tutors,\r\naccording to the wants of the individual. Having thus ingratiated\r\nthemselves, various are the ways of procedure. Should the new-comer\r\nprove confiding, perhaps he is told that 'there is _one_ vacancy left in\r\nour Society, and if you wish, I will try and get it for you,' which,\r\nafter a short absence, presumed to be occupied with strenuous effort,\r\nthe amiable advocate succeeds in doing, to the great gratitude of his\r\nFreshman friend. But should he prove less tractable, and wish to hear\r\nboth sides, then some comrade is perhaps introduced as belonging to the\r\nother Society, and is sorely worsted in a discussion of the respective\r\nexcellencies of the two rival fraternities. Or if he be religious, the\r\nsame disguised comrade shall visit him on the Sabbath, and with much\r\nprofanity urge the claims of his supposititious Society. By such, and\r\nmore honorable means, the destiny of each is soon fixed, and only a few\r\nstragglers await undecided the so-called 'Statement of Facts,' when with\r\ninfinite laughter and great hustling of 'force committees,' they are\r\npreädmitted to 'Brewster's Hall' to hear the three appointed orators of\r\neach Society laud themselves and deny all virtue to their opponents;\r\nwhich done, in chaotic state of mind they fall an easy prey to the\r\nstrongest, and with the rest are initiated that very evening with lusty\r\ncheers and noisy songs and speeches protracted far into the night.\r\n\r\nNor less notable are the Secret Societies, two or three of which exist\r\nin every class, and are handed down yearly to the care of successors.\r\nWith more quiet, but with busy effort, their members are carefully\r\nchosen and pledged, and with phosphorous, coffins, and dead men's bones,\r\nare awfully admitted to the mysteries of Greek initials, private\r\nliterature, and secret conviviality. Being picked men, and united, they\r\neach form an _imperium in imperio_ in the large societies much used by\r\nambitious collegians. Curious as it may seem, too, many of these\r\nsocieties have gained some influence and notoriety beyond college walls.\r\nThe Psi Upsilon, Alpha Delta Phi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon Societies, are\r\nnow each ramified through a dozen or more colleges, having annual\r\nconventions, attended by numerous delegates from the several chapters,\r\nand by graduate members of high standing in every department of letters.\r\nYet they have no deep significance like that of the Burschenschaft.\r\n\r\nClose treading on the heels of Society movements, comes the annual\r\nfoot-ball game between the Freshmen and Sophomores. The former having\r\n_ad mores majorum_ given the challenge and received its acceptance, on\r\nsome sunny autumn afternoon you may see the rival classes of perhaps a\r\nhundred men each, drawn up on the Green in battle and motley array, the\r\nlatter consisting of shirt and pants, unsalable even to the sons of\r\nIsrael, and huge boots, perhaps stuffed with paper to prevent hapless\r\nabrasion of shins. The steps of the State House are crowded with the\r\n'upper classes,' and ladies are numerous in the balconies of the\r\nNew-Haven Hotel. The umpires come forward, and the ground is cleared of\r\nintruders. There is a dead silence as an active Freshman, retiring to\r\ngain an impetus, rushes on; a general rush as the ball is _warned_; then\r\na seizure of the disputed bladder, and futile endeavors to give it\r\nanother impetus, ending in stout grappling and the endeavor to force it\r\nthrough. Now there is fierce issue; neither party gives an inch. Now\r\nthere is a side movement and roll of the struggling orb as to relieve\r\nthe pressure. Now one party gives a little, then closes desperately in\r\nagain on the encouraged enemy. Now a dozen are down in a heap, and there\r\nis momentary cessation, then up and pressing on again. Here a fiery\r\nspirit grows pugnacious, but is restrained by his class-mates; there\r\nanother has his shirt torn off him, and presents the picturesque\r\nappearance of an amateur scarecrow. There are, in short, both\r\n\r\n  'Breaches of peace and pieces of breeches,'\r\n\r\nuntil the stronger party carries the ball over the bounds, or it gets\r\nwithout the crowd unobserved by most, and goes off hurriedly under the\r\ndirection of some swift-footed player to the same goal. Then mighty is\r\nthe cheering of the victors, and woe-begone the looks, though defiant\r\nthe groans of the vanquished. And thus, with much noise and dispute, and\r\ngreat confounding of umpire, they continue for three, four, or five\r\ngames, or until the evening chapel-bell calls to prayers. In the evening\r\nthe victors sing pæans of victory by torch-light on the State House\r\nsteps, and bouquets, supposed to be sent by the fair ones of the\r\nbalconies, are presented and received with great glorification.\r\n\r\nNor less exciting and interesting in college annals, is the Burial of\r\nEuclid. The incipient Sophomores, assisted by the other classes, must\r\nperform duly the funeral rites of their friend of Freshman-days, by\r\nnocturnal services at the 'Temple.' Wherefore, toward midnight of some\r\ndark Wednesday evening in October, you may see masked and\r\nfantastically-dressed students by twos and threes stealing through the\r\ndarkness to the common rendezvous. An Indian chief of gray leggins and\r\ngrave demeanor goes down arm in arm with the prince of darkness, and a\r\nportly squire of the old English school communes sociably with a\r\npatriotic continental. Here is a reïnforcement of 'Labs,' (students of\r\nchemistry,) noisy with numerous fish-horns; there a detachment of\r\n'Medics,' appropriately armed with thigh-bones, according to their\r\nseveral resources. Then, when gathered within the hall, a crowded mass\r\nof ugly masks, shocking bad hats, and antique attire, look down from\r\nthe steep slope of seats upon the stage where lies the effigy of Father\r\nEuclid, in inflammable state. After a voluntary by the 'Blow Hards,'\r\n'Horne Blenders,' or whatever facetiously denominated band performs the\r\nmusic, there is a mighty singing of some Latin song, written with more\r\nreference to the occasion than to correct quantities, of which the\r\nfollowing opening stanza may serve as a specimen:\r\n\r\n  'Fundite nunc lacrymas,\r\n  Plorate Yalenses:\r\n  Euclid rapuerunt fata,\r\n  Membra et ejus inhumata\r\n  Linquimus tres menses.'\r\n\r\nThe wild, grotesque hilarity of those midnight songs can never be\r\nforgotten. Then come poem and funeral oration, interspersed with songs,\r\nand music by the band--'Old Grimes is dead,' 'Music from the Spheres,'\r\nand other equally solemn and rare productions. Then are torches lighted,\r\nand two by two the long train of torch-bearers defiles through the\r\nsilent midnight streets to the sound of solemn music, and passing by the\r\ndark cemetery of the real dead, bear through 'Tutor's Lane' the coffin\r\nof their mathematical ancestor. They climb the hill beyond, and commit\r\nhim to the flames, invoking Pluto, in Latin prayer, and chanting a final\r\ndirge, while the flare of torches, the fearful grotesqueness of each\r\nuncouth disguised wight, and the dark background of the encircling\r\nforest, make the wild mirth almost solemn.\r\n\r\nSo ends the fun of the closing year; and with the exception of the\r\nvarious excitements of burlesque debate on Thanksgiving eve, when the\r\nsmallest Freshman in either Society is elected President _pro tempore;_\r\nof the _noctes ambrosianæ_ of the secret societies; of appointments,\r\nprize essays, and the periodical issue of the _Yale Literary_, now a\r\nvenerable periodical of twenty years' standing; the severe drill of\r\ncollege study finds little relaxation during the winter months. Three\r\nrecitations or lectures each day, a review each day of the last lesson,\r\nreview of and examination on each term's study, with two biennial\r\nexaminations during the four years' course, require great diligence to\r\nexcel, and considerable industry to keep above water. But with the\r\nreturning spring the unused walks again are paced, and the dry keels\r\nlaunched into the vernal waters. Again, in the warm twilight of evening,\r\nyou hear the laugh and song go up under the wide-spreading elms. Now,\r\ntoo, comes the Exhibition of the Wooden Spoon, where the low-appointment\r\nmen burlesque the staid performances of college, and present the lowest\r\nscholar on the appointment-list with an immense spoon, handsomely carved\r\nfrom rosewood, and engraved with the convivial motto: '_Dum vivimus\r\nvivamus_.'\r\n\r\nThen, too, come those summer days upon the harbor, when the fleet\r\nclub-boats, and their stalwart crews, like those of Alcinous,\r\n\r\n  [Greek: 'kouroi anarriptein ala pêdô,']\r\n\r\nin their showy uniforms, push out from Ryker's; some bound upward past\r\nthe oyster-beds of Fair Haven, away up among the salt-marsh meadows,\r\nwhere the Quinnipiac wanders under quaint old bridges among fair, green\r\nhills; some for the Light, shooting out into the broad waters of the\r\nopen bay, their feathered oars flashing in the sunlight; some for\r\nSavin's Rock, where among the cool cedars that overshadow the steep\r\nrock, they sing uproarious student-songs until the dreamy beauty of\r\nocean, with its laughing sunlight, its white sails, and green, quiet\r\nshores, like visible music, shall steal in and fill the soul until the\r\nnoisy hilarity becomes eloquent silence. And now, as in the\r\ntwilight-hour they are again afloat, you may hear the song again:\r\n\r\n  'Many the mile we row, boys,\r\n    Merry, merry the song;\r\n  The joys of long ago, boys,\r\n    Shall be remembered long.\r\n  Then as we rest upon the oar,\r\n    We raise the cheerful strain,\r\n  Which we have often sung before,\r\n    And gladly sing again.'\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting day of college-life is\r\n'Presentation-Day,' when the Seniors, having passed the various ordeals\r\nof _viva voce_ and written examinations, are presented by the senior\r\ntutor to the President, as worthy of their degrees. This ceremony is\r\nsucceeded by a farewell poem and oration by two of the class chosen for\r\nthe purpose, after which they partake of a collation with the college\r\nfaculty, and then gather under the elms in front of the colleges. They\r\nseat themselves on a ring of benches, inside of which are placed huge\r\ntubs of lemonade, (the strongest drink provided for public occasions,)\r\nlong clay pipes, and great store of mildest Turkey tobacco. Here, led on\r\nby an amateur band of fiddlers, flutists, etc., through the long\r\nafternoon of 'the leafy month of June,' surrounded by the other classes\r\nwho crowd about in cordial sympathy, they smoke manfully, harangue\r\nenthusiastically, laugh uproariously, and sing lustily, beginning always\r\nwith the glorious old Burschen song of 'Gaudeamus':\r\n\r\n  'Gaudeamus igitur\r\n  Juvenes dum sumus:\r\n  Post jucundam juventutem,\r\n  Post molestam senectutem,\r\n  Nos habebit humus.'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Pereat tristitia,\r\n  Pereant osores,\r\n  Pereat diabolus,\r\n  Quivis antiburschius\r\n  Atque irrisores.'\r\n\r\nThen as the shadows grow long, perhaps they sing again those stirring\r\nwords which one returning to the third semi-centennial of his Alma\r\nMater, wrote with all the warmth and power of manly affection:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Count not the tears of the long-gone years,\r\n    With their moments of pain and sorrow;\r\n  But laugh in the light of their memories bright,\r\n    And treasure them all for the morrow.\r\n  Then roll the song in waves along,\r\n    While the hours are bright before us,\r\n  And grand and hale are the towers of Yale,\r\n    Like guardians towering o'er us.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Clasp ye the hand 'neath the arches grand\r\n    That with garlands span our greeting.\r\n  With a silent prayer that an hour as fair\r\n    May smile on each after meeting:\r\n  And long may the song, the joyous song,\r\n    Roll on in the hours before us,\r\n  And grand and hale may the elms of Yale\r\n    For many a year bend o'er us.'\r\n\r\nThen standing in closer circle, they pass around to give, each to each,\r\na farewell grasp of the hand; and amid that extravagant merriment the\r\nlips begin to quiver, and eyes grow dim. Then, two by two, preceded by\r\nthe miscellaneous band, playing 'The Road to Boston,' and headed by a\r\nhuge base-viol, borne by two stout fellows, and played by a third, they\r\npass through each hall of the long line of buildings, giving farewell\r\ncheers, and at the foot of one of the tall towers, each throws his\r\nhandful of earth on the roots of an ivy, which, clinging about those\r\nbrown masses of stone, in days to come, he trusts will be typical of\r\ntheir mutual, remembrance as he breathes the silent prayer: 'Lord, keep\r\nour memories green!'\r\n\r\nSo end the college-days of these most uproarious of mirth-makers and\r\nhardest of American students; and the hundred whose joys and sorrows\r\nhave been identified through four happy years, are dispersed over the\r\nland. They are partially gathered again at Commencement, but the broken\r\nband is never completely united. On the third anniversary of their\r\ngraduation, the first class-meeting takes place; and the first happy\r\nfather is presented with a silver cup, suitably inscribed. On the tenth,\r\ntwentieth, and other decennial years, the gradually diminishing band, in\r\nsmaller and smaller numbers, meet about the beloved shrine, until only\r\ntwo or three gray-haired men clasp the once stout hand and renew the\r\nremembrance of 'the days that are gone.'\r\n\r\n  'They come ere life departs,\r\n   Ere winged death appears.\r\n  To throng their joyous hearts\r\n    With dreams of sunnier years:\r\n      To meet once more\r\n        Where pleasures sprang,\r\n      And arches rang\r\n        With songs of yore.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'In the fourteenth century, Novella de Andrea, daughter of\r\nthe celebrated canonist, frequently occupied her father's chair; and her\r\nbeauty was so striking, that a curtain was drawn before her in order not\r\nto distract the attention of the students.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Vol. i. p. 392.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Vol. iii. pp. 379 and 473.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The Linonian Society was founded in 1753; The Brothers in\r\nUnity, fifteen years later, in 1768.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGO IN AND WIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Will nothing rouse the Northmen\r\n              To see what they can do?\r\n            When in one day of our war-growth\r\n              The South are growing two?\r\n  When they win a victory it always counts a pair,\r\n  One at home in Dixie, and another _over there_!\r\n\r\n            North, you have spent your millions!\r\n              North, you have sent your men!\r\n            But if the war ask billions,\r\n              You must give it all again.\r\n  Don't stop to think of what you've done--it's very fine and true--\r\n  But in fighting for our _life_, the thing is, _what we've yet to do_.\r\n\r\n            Who dares to talk of party,\r\n              And the coming President,\r\n            When the rebels threaten 'bolder raids,'\r\n              And all the land is rent?\r\n  How _dare_ we learn 'they gather strength,' by every telegraph,\r\n  If an army of a million could have scattered them like chaff!\r\n\r\n            What means it when the people\r\n              Are prompt with blood and gold,\r\n            That this devil-born rebellion\r\n              Is growing two years old?\r\n  The Nigger feeds them as of old, and keeps away their fears,\r\n  While 'gayly into battle' go the 'Southern cavaliers.'\r\n\r\n            And the Richmond _Whig_, which lately\r\n              Lay groveling in mud,\r\n            Shows its mulatto insolence,\r\n              And prates of 'better blood:'\r\n  'We ruled them in the Union; we can thrash them out of bounds:\r\n  Ye are mad, ye drunken Helots--cap off, ye Yankee hounds!'\r\n\r\n            Yet the Northman has the power,\r\n              And the North would not be still!\r\n            Rise up! rise up, ye rulers!\r\n              Send the people where ye will!\r\n  Don't organize your victories--fly to battle with your bands--\r\n  If you can find the brains to lead, _we'll find the willing hands!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN NEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Neal was born at the close of the last century, in Portland, Maine,\r\nwhere he now resides; and during sixty years it has not been decided\r\nwhether he or his twin sister was the elder.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1793. When he was four weeks old, he was fatherless. His\r\nschool education began early, as his mother was a celebrated teacher.\r\nFrom his mother's school he went to the town school, where he once\r\ndeclared in our hearing that he 'got licked, frozen, and stupefied.'\r\nThat he had a rough time, may be inferred from the fact that his parents\r\nwere Quakers, and he, notwithstanding his peaceful birthright, _fought_\r\nhis way through the school as 'Quaker Neal.' He went barefoot in those\r\ndays through a great deal of trouble. Somewhere in his early life, he\r\nwent to a Quaker boarding-school at Windham, where he always averred\r\nthat they starved him through two winters, till it was a luxury to get a\r\nmouthful of brown bread that was not a crumb or fragment that some one\r\nhad left. At this school the boys learned to sympathize in advance with\r\nOliver Twist--to eat trash, till they would quarrel for a bit of salt\r\nfish-skin, and to generalize in their hate of Friends from very narrow\r\ndata. We have heard Neal speak of the two winters he spent in that\r\nschool as by far the most miserable six or eight months of his whole\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nVery early, we think at the age of twelve years, he was imprisoned\r\nbehind a counter, and continued there till he was near twenty; and by\r\nthe time he was twenty one, he had worked his way to a retail shop of\r\nhis own in Court street, Boston. We next track him to Baltimore, where,\r\nin 1815, if we are not out in our chronology, John Pierpont, John Neal,\r\nand Joseph L. Lord were in partnership in a wholesale trade. Neal's\r\nsomersets in business--from partnership to wholesale jobbing, which he\r\nwent into on his own hook with a capital of _one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars_, and as he once said, in speaking of this remarkable business\r\noperation, 'with about as much credit as a lamp-lighter'--may not be any\r\nmore interesting to the public than they were to him then; so we shall\r\nnot be particular about them in this chapter of chronicles.\r\n\r\nAt Baltimore he was very successful, after he got at it, in making\r\nmoney, but failed after the peace in 1816. This failure made him a\r\nlawyer. With his characteristic impetuosity, he renounced and denounced\r\ntrade, determined to study law, and beat the profession with its own\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nThis impulse drove him at rather more than railroad speed. He studied as\r\nif a demon chased him. By computation of then Justice Story, he\r\naccomplished fourteen years' hard work in four. During this time he was\r\nreading largely in half-a-dozen languages that he knew nothing of when\r\nhe began, _and maintaining himself_ by writing, either as editor of _The\r\nTelegraph_, coëditor of _The Portico_, (for which he wrote near a volume\r\noctavo in a year or two,) and also as joint-editor of Paul Allen's\r\n_Revolution_, besides a tremendous avalanche of novels and poetry. We\r\nhave amused ourself casting up the amount of this four years' labor. It\r\nseems entirely too large for the calibre of common belief, and we\r\nsuppose Neal will hardly believe us, especially if he have grown\r\nluxurious and lazy in these latter days. Crowded into these four years,\r\nwe find: for the _Portico_ and _Telegraph_, and half-a-dozen other\r\npapers, ten volumes; 'Keep Cool,' two volumes; 'Seventy-Six,' two\r\nvolumes; 'Errata,' two volumes; 'Niagara and Goldau,' two volumes; Index\r\nto Niles' Register, three volumes; 'Otho,' one volume; 'Logan,' four\r\nvolumes; 'Randolph,' two volumes; Buckingham's Galaxy, Miscellanies, and\r\nPoetry, two volumes; making the incredible quantity of thirty volumes.\r\nHe could no more have gone leisurely and carefully through this amount\r\nof work, than a skater could walk a mile a minute on his skates. The\r\nmarvel is, that he got through it on any terms, not that he won his own\r\ndisrespect forever. We do not wonder that he manufactured more bayonets\r\nthan bee-stings for his literary armory, but we wonder that he became a\r\nliterary champion at all. With all the irons Neal had in the fire, we\r\nare not to expect Addisonian paragraphs; and yet he has in his lifetime\r\nbeen mistaken for Washington Irving, as we can show by an extract from\r\nan old letter of his, which we will give by and by.\r\n\r\nA power that could produce what Neal produced between 1819 and 1823,\r\nproperly disciplined and economized, might have performed tasks\r\nanalogous to those of the lightning, since it has been put in harness\r\nand employed to carry the mail. When genius has its day of humiliation\r\nfor the wasted water of life, Neal may put on sackcloth, for he never\r\neconomized his power; but for the soul's fire quenched in idleness, or\r\nsmothered in worldliness, certainly for these years, he need wear no\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\nHis novels are always like a rushing torrent, never like a calm stream.\r\nThey all are dignified with a purpose, with a determination to correct\r\nsome error, to remedy some abuse, to do good in any number of instances.\r\nThey are not unlike a field of teasels in blossom--there are the thorny\r\npoints of this strange plant, and the delicate and exceedingly beautiful\r\nblossom beside, resting on the very points of a hundred lances, with\r\ntheir lovely lilac bloom. Those who have lived where teasels grow will\r\nunderstand this illustration. We doubt not it will seem very pointed and\r\nproper to Neal. It must be remembered that the teasel is a very useful\r\narticle in dressing cloth, immense cards of them being set in machinery\r\nand made to pass over the cloth and raise and clean the nap. A criticism\r\ntaking in all the good and bad points of these novels, would be too\r\nextensive to pass the door of any review or magazine, unless in an\r\nextra. They are full of the faults and virtues of their author's\r\nunformed character. Rich as a California mine, we only wish they could\r\nbe passed through a gold-washer, and the genuine yield be thrown again\r\ninto our literary currency.\r\n\r\nThe character of his poems is indicated by their titles, 'Niagara' and\r\n'Goldau,' and by the _nom de plume_ he thought proper to publish them\r\nunder, namely, 'Jehu O. Cataract.' But portions of his poetry repudiate\r\nthis thunderous parentage, and are soft as the whispering zephyr or the\r\ncooing of doves. The gentleness of strength has a double beauty: its\r\nown, and that of contrast. Still, the predominating character of Neal's\r\npoetry is the sweep of the wild eagle's wing and the roar of rushing\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nWe read his 'Otho' years since, when we were younger than now, and our\r\npulse beat stronger; and we read it 'holding our breath to the end'--or\r\nthis was the exact sensation we felt, as nearly as we can remember,\r\ntwelve years ago.\r\n\r\nThe character of Neal's periodical writing was just suited to a working\r\ncountry, that was in too great a hurry to dine decently. People wanted\r\nto be arrested. If they could stop, they had brains enough to judge you\r\nand your wares; but they needed to be lassoed first, and lashed into\r\nquietness afterward, and then they would hear and revere the man who had\r\nbeen 'smart' enough to conquer them. John Neal seemed to be conscious of\r\nthis without knowing it. A veritable woman in his intuitions, he spoke\r\nfrom them, and the heart of the people responded. The term 'live Yankee'\r\nwas of his coinage, and it aptly christened himself.\r\n\r\nNeal went to Europe in 1823, and remained three years. That an American\r\ncould manage to maintain himself in England by writing, which Neal did,\r\nis a pregnant fact. But his power is better proved than in this way. He\r\nleft America with a vow of temperance during his travels; he returned\r\nwith it unbroken. Honor to the strong man! He had traveled through\r\nEngland and France, merely wetting his lips with wine. He wrote volumes\r\nfor British periodicals, and also his 'Brother Jonathan' in three\r\nvolumes. After looking over the catalogue of his labors for an hour, we\r\nalways want to draw a long breath and rest. There is no doubt that since\r\nhis return from Europe in 1826, he has written and published, in books\r\nand newspapers, what would make at least one hundred volumes duodecimo.\r\nIt would be a hard fate for such an author to be condemned to read his\r\nown productions, for he would never get time to read any thing else.\r\n\r\nNeal's peculiar style caused many oddities and extravagances to be laid\r\nat his door that did not belong there. From this fact of style, people\r\nthought he could not disguise himself on paper. This is a mistake, for\r\nhis papers in Miller's _European Magazine_ were attributed to Washington\r\nIrving. We transcribe the paragraph of a letter from Neal, promised\r\nabove, and which we received years since:\r\n\r\n     'The papers I wrote for Miller's _European Magazine_ have been\r\n     generally attributed to no less a person than Washington Irving--a\r\n     man whom I resemble just about as much in my person as in my\r\n     writing. He, Addisonian and Goldsmithian to the back-bone, and\r\n     steeped to the very lips in what is called classical literature, of\r\n     which I have a horror and a loathing, as the deadest of all dead\r\n     languages; he, foil of subdued pleasantry, quiet humor, and genial\r\n     blandness, upon all subjects. I, altogether--but never mind. He is\r\n     a generous fellow, and led the way to all our triumphs in that\r\n     'field of the cloth of gold' which men call the _literary_'.\r\n\r\nNeal went to England a sort of Yankee knight-errant to fight for his\r\ncountry. He had the wisdom to fight with his visor down, and quarter on\r\nthe enemy. He took heavy tribute from _Blackwood_ and others for his\r\narticles vindicating America, which came to be extravagantly quoted and\r\nread. His article for _Blackwood_ on the Five Presidents and the Five\r\nCandidates, portraying General Jackson to the life as he afterward\r\nproved to be, was translated into most of the European languages. I\r\ntranscribe another paragraph from an old letter. It is too\r\ncharacteristic to remain unread by the public:\r\n\r\n     'For my paper on the Presidents, _Blackwood_ sent me five guineas,\r\n     and engaged me as a regular contributor, which I determined to be.\r\n     But I ventured to write for other journals without consulting him;\r\n     whereat he grew tetchy and impertinent, and I blew him up sky-high,\r\n     recalled an article in type for which he had paid me _fifteen_\r\n     guineas, (I wish he had kept it,) refunded the money, (I wish I\r\n     hadn't,) and left him forever. But this I will say: _Blackwood_\r\n     behaved handsomely to me from first to last, with one small\r\n     exception, and showed more courage and good feeling toward '_my\r\n     beloved_ country' while I was at the helm of that department, than\r\n     any and all the editors, publishers, and proprietors in Britain.\r\n     Give the devil his due, I say!'\r\n\r\nThis escapade with _Blackwood_ might have been a national loss; but\r\nhappily, Neal had accomplished his purpose--vindicated his country by\r\ntelling the truth, and by showing in himself the metal of one of her\r\nsons. He had silenced the whole British battery of periodicals who had\r\nbeen abusing America. He had forced literary England to a capitulation,\r\nand he could well enough afford to leave his fifteen guineas at\r\n_Blackwood's_, and go to France for recreation, as he did about this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 he returned to America, and applied for admission to the\r\nNew-York bar. This started a hornet's nest. He had been 'sarving up' too\r\nmany newspaper and other scribblers, to be left in peace any longer.\r\nWith an excellent opinion of himself, his contempt was often quite as\r\nlarge, to say the least of it, as his charity; and he had doubtless, at\r\ntimes, in England, ridiculed his countrymen to the full of their\r\ndeserving; knowing that if he admitted the debtor side honestly, he\r\nwould be allowed to fix the amount of credit without controversy. His\r\nYankees are alarming specimens, which a growing civilization has so\r\nnearly 'used up' that they are now regarded somewhat like fossil remains\r\nof some extinct species of animal.\r\n\r\nAbout the time Neal applied for admission to the New-York bar, a portion\r\nof the people of Portland, stimulated by the aggrieved _literati_ above\r\nmentioned, determined to elevate themselves into a mob _pro tem._, and\r\nexpel him from Portland. In the true spirit of his Quaker ancestry, who,\r\nsome one has said, always decided they were needed where they were not\r\nwanted, Neal determined to stay in Portland, The mobocrats declared that\r\nhe was sold to the British. Neal retorted, in cool irony, that 'he only\r\nwished he had got an offer.' They asserted that he was the mortal enemy\r\nof our peculiar institutions, and that therefore he must be placarded\r\nand mobbed. Hand-bills were issued, and widely circulated. But they did\r\nnot effect their object. They only drove this son of the Quakers to\r\n_swear_ that he would stay in Portland. And he did stay, and established\r\na literary paper, though he once said to us that 'he would as soon have\r\nthought of setting up a _Daily Advertiser_ in the Isle of Shoals three\r\nmonths before.'\r\n\r\nHis marriage took place about this time, and was, as he used to say, his\r\npledge for good behavior. His wife was one of the loveliest of\r\nNew-England's daughters, and looked as if she might tame a tiger by the\r\nsimple magic of her presence. It is several years since we have met\r\nNeal, and near a dozen since we saw him in his home. At that time he\r\nmust have been greatly in fault not to be a proud and happy man. If a\r\ncalm, restful exterior, and a fresh and youthful beauty, are signs of\r\nhappiness, then Mrs. Neal was one of the happiest women in the world.\r\nThe delicate softness, the perfection of youth in her beauty, lives\r\nstill in our memory. It is one of those real charms that never drop\r\nthrough the mind's meshes.\r\n\r\nJudging from Neal's impulsive nature, he was not the last man to do\r\nsomething to be sorry for; but his wife and children looked as if they\r\nwere never sorry. We remember a little girl of some five or six years;\r\nwe believe they called her Maggie. Her dimpled cheek, her white round\r\nneck and arms, and the perfect symmetry of her form, and the grace of\r\nher motions, have haunted us these twelve years. We would not promise to\r\nremember her as long or as well if we should see her again in these\r\ndays. But we made up our mind then, that we would rather be the father\r\nof that child than the author of all Neal had written, or might have\r\nwritten, even though he had been a wise and prudent man, and had done\r\nhis work as well as he doubtless wishes now that he had done it. Neal is\r\nonly half himself away from his beautiful home. There, he is in\r\nplace--an eagle in a nest lined with down, soft as eider. There his fine\r\ntaste is manifest in every thing. If we judge of his taste by his\r\nrapidly-written works, we are sure to do him injustice. We find in him a\r\nunion of the most opposite qualities. We can not say a harmonious union.\r\nAn inflexible industry is not often united with a bird-like celerity and\r\ngrace of movement. With Neal, the two first have always been\r\ncombined--the whole on occasions, which might have been multiplied into\r\nunbroken continuity if he had possessed the calm greatness that never\r\nhastens and never rests. He did not rest; but through the first half of\r\nhis life, he surely forgot the Scripture which saith: 'He that believeth\r\nshall not make haste.' It has often been asserted, that power which has\r\nrest is greater than a turbulent power. We shall not attempt to settle\r\nwhether Erie or Niagara is greater, but we should certainly choose the\r\nLake for purposes of navigation.\r\n\r\nMany men are careless of their character in private, but sufficiently\r\ncareful in public. The reverse is true of Neal. He has never hesitated\r\nto throw his gauntlet in the face of the public as he threw his letters\r\nof introduction in the fire when he arrived in Europe. But when he comes\r\ninto the charmed circle of his home, he is neither reckless nor\r\npugilistic, but a downright gentleman. We don't mean to say that Neal\r\nnever gets in a passion in private, or that he never needed the\r\nwholesome restraint of a strait-waistcoat in the disputes of a Portland\r\nLyceum or debating-club. We do not give illustrative anecdotes, because\r\na lively imagination can conceive them, and probably has manufactured\r\nseveral that have been afloat; still, we dare guess that the subject has\r\nsometimes given facts to base the fictions on.\r\n\r\nWe speak of the past. A man with a forty-wildcat power imprisoned in him\r\nis not very likely to travel on from youth to age, keeping the peace on\r\nall occasions. Years bring a calming wisdom. The same man who once swore\r\nfive consecutive minutes, because he was forbidden by his landlady to\r\nswear on penalty of leaving her house, and then made all the inmates\r\nvote to refrain from profane language, and rigidly enforced the rule\r\nthus _democratically_ established, is now, after a lapse of more than\r\nthirty years, (particularly provoking impulse aside,) a careful and\r\ndignified gentleman, who might be a Judge, if the public so willed.\r\n\r\nThat a long line of intellectual and finely developed ancestry gives a\r\nman a better patent of nobility than all the kings of all countries\r\ncould confer, is beginning to be understood and believed among us;\r\nthough the old battle against titles and privilege, and the hereditary\r\ndescent of both, for a time blinded Americans to the true philosophy of\r\nnoble birth.\r\n\r\nNeal's ancestors came originally from Scotland, and exemplify the\r\nproverb that 'bluid is thicker than water,' in more ways than one. They\r\nhave a strong feeling of clanship, or, in other words, they are\r\nconvinced that it is an honor to be a Neal, and many of the last\r\ngeneration have given proof positive that their belief is a fact. The\r\npresent generation we have little knowledge of, and do not know whether\r\nthey fulfill the promise of the name.\r\n\r\nNeal has done good service to the Democracy of our country in many ways,\r\nbesides being one of the first and bravest champions of woman's rights.\r\nHe has labored for our literature with an ability commensurate with his\r\nzeal, and he has drawn many an unfledged genius from the nest,\r\nencouraged him to try his wings, and magnetized him into\r\nself-dependence. A bold heavenward flight has often been the\r\nconsequence. A prophecy of Neal's that an idea or a man would succeed,\r\nhas seldom failed of fulfillment. We can not say this of the many\r\naspiring magazines and periodicals that have solicited the charity of\r\nhis name. We recollect, when brass buttons were universally worn on\r\nmen's coats, a wag undertook to prove that they were very unhealthy,\r\nfrom the fact that more than half the persons who wore them suffered\r\nfrom chronic or acute disease, and died before they had reached a\r\ncanonical age. According to this mode of generalization, Neal could be\r\nconvicted of causing the premature death of nine tenths of the defunct\r\nperiodicals in this country--probably no great sin, if it really lay at\r\nhis door.\r\n\r\nIn a brief outline sketch, such as we have chosen to produce, our\r\nreaders will perceive that only slight justice can be done to a man in\r\nthe manifold relations to men and things which contribute to form the\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nJohn Neal's personal appearance is a credit to the country. He is tall,\r\nwith a broad chest, and a most imposing presence. One of the finest\r\nsights we ever saw, was Neal standing with his arms folded before a fine\r\npicture. His devotion to physical exercise, and his personal example to\r\nhis family in the practice of it--training his wife and children to take\r\nthe sparring-gloves and cross the foils with him in those graceful\r\nattitudes which he could perfectly teach, because they were fully\r\ndeveloped in himself--all this has inevitably contributed to the health\r\nand beauty of his beautiful family.\r\n\r\nFew men have had so many right ideas of the art or science of living as\r\nJohn Neal, and fewer still have acted upon them so faithfully. When we\r\nlast saw him, some ten years since--when he had lived more than half a\r\ncentury--his eye had lost none of its original fire, not a nerve or\r\nsinew was unbraced by care, labor, or struggle. He stood before us, a\r\nnoble specimen of the strong and stalwart growth of a new and\r\nunexhausted land.\r\n\r\n     NOTE,--The foregoing must have been written years ago, if\r\n     one may judge by the color of the paper; and as the writer is now\r\n     abroad, so as not to be within reach, the manuscript has been put\r\n     into the hands of a gentleman who has been more or less acquainted\r\n     with Mr. Neal from his boyhood up, and he has consented to finish\r\n     the article by bringing down the record to our day, and putting on\r\n     what he calls a 'snapper.'\r\n\r\nMost of what follows, if we do not wholly misunderstand the intimations\r\nthat accompany the manuscript, is in the very language of Mr. Neal\r\nhimself word for word; gathered up we care not how, whether from\r\ncorrespondence or conversation, so that there is no breach of manly\r\ntrust and no indecorum to be charged.\r\n\r\n'As to my family,' he writes, in reply to some body's questioning, 'I\r\nknow not where they originated, nor how. Sometimes I have thought,\r\nalthough I have never said as much before, that we must have come up of\r\nourselves--the spontaneous growth of a rude, rocky soil, swept by the\r\nboisterous north-wind, and washed by the heavy surges of some great\r\nunvisited sea. Of course, the writer you mention, who says that my\r\nancestors--if I ever had any--'came from Scotland,' must know something\r\nthat I never heard of, to the best of my recollection and belief.\r\nSomewhere in England I have supposed they originated, and probably along\r\nthe coast of Essex; for there, about Portsmouth and Dover, I have always\r\nfelt so much at home in the graveyards--among my own household, as it\r\nwere, the names being so familiar to me, and the grave-stones now to be\r\nseen in Portsmouth and Dover, New-Hampshire, where the Neals were first\r\nheard of three or four generations ago, being duplicates of some I saw\r\nin Portsmouth and Dover, England.\r\n\r\n'Others have maintained, with great earnestness and plausibility, as if\r\nit were something to brag of, that we have the blood of Oliver Cromwell\r\nin us; and one, at least, who has gone a-field into heraldry, and\r\nstrengthens every position with armorial bearings--which only goes to\r\nshow the unprofitableness of all such labor, so far as we are\r\nconcerned--that we are of the '_red_ O'Neals,' not the _learned_\r\nO'Neals, if there ever were any, but the 'red O'Neals of Ireland,' and\r\nthat I am, in fact, a lineal descendant of that fine fellow who\r\n'_bearded_' Queen Elizabeth in her presence-chamber, with his right hand\r\nclutching the hilt of his dagger.\r\n\r\n'But, for myself, I must acknowledge that if I ever had a\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, I know not where to dig for him--on my father's\r\nside, I mean; for on the side of my mother I have lots of grandfathers\r\nand great-grandfathers--and furthermore this deponent sayeth not--up to\r\nthe days of George Fox; enough, I think, to show clearly that the Neals\r\ndid not originate among the aborigines of the New World, whatever may be\r\nsupposed to the contrary. And so, in a word, the whole sum and substance\r\nof all I know about my progenitors, male and female, is, that they were\r\nalways a sober-minded, conscientious, hard-working race, with a way and\r\na will of their own, and a habit of seeing for themselves, and judging\r\nfor themselves, and taking the consequences.\r\n\r\n'Nor is it true that I am a 'large' or 'tall' man, though, in some\r\nunaccountable way, always passing for a great deal more than I would\r\never measure or weigh; and my own dear mother having lived and died in\r\nthe belief that I was good six feet, and well-proportioned, like my\r\nfather. My inches never exceeded five feet eight-and-a-half, and my\r\nweight never varied from one hundred and forty-seven to one hundred and\r\nforty-nine pounds, for about five-and-forty years; after which, getting\r\nfat and lazy, I have come to weigh from one hundred and sixty-five to\r\none hundred and seventy-five pounds, without being an inch taller, I am\r\nquite sure.'\r\n\r\nMr. Neal owns up, it appears, to the following publications, omitted by\r\nthe writer of the article you mentioned: 'Rachel Dyer,' one volume;\r\n'Authorship,' one volume; 'Brother Jonathan,' three volumes, (English\r\nedition;) 'Ruth Elder,' one volume; 'One Word More;' 'True Womanhood,'\r\none volume; magazine articles, reviews, and stories in most of the\r\nBritish and American monthlies, and in some of the quarterlies, to the\r\namount of twenty volumes, at least, duodecimo. In addition to which, he\r\nhas been a liberal contributor all his life to some of the ablest\r\nnewspapers of the age, and either sole or sub-editor, or associate, in\r\nperhaps twenty other enterprises, most of which fell through.\r\n\r\nHe claims, too--being a modest man--and others who know him best\r\nacknowledge his claims, we see--that he revolutionized _Blackwood_ and\r\nthe British periodical press, at a time when they were all against us;\r\nthat he began the war on titles in this country, that he broke up the\r\nlottery system and the militia system, and proposed (through the\r\n_Westminster Review_) the only safe and reasonable plan of emancipation\r\nthat ever appeared; that with him originated the question of woman's\r\nrights; that he introduced gymnasia to our people; and, in short, that\r\nhe has always been good for something, and always lived to some purpose.\r\n'And furthermore deponent sayeth not.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER AND THE CIVILIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Dickens expressed regret for having written his foolish\r\n_American Notes_, and _Martin Chuzzlewit_, he 'improved the occasion' to\r\ncall us a large-hearted and good-natured people, or something to that\r\neffect--I have not his _peccavi_ by me, and write from 'a favorable\r\ngeneral impression.'\r\n\r\nIt is not weak vanity which may lead any American to claim that in this\r\ncompliment lies a great truth. The American _is_ large-hearted and\r\ngood-natured, and when a few of his comrades join in a good work, he\r\nwill aid them with a lavish and Jack-tar like generosity. Charity is\r\npeculiarly at home in America. A few generations have accumulated, in\r\nall the older States, hospitals, schools, and beneficent institutions,\r\npractically equal in every respect to those which have been the slow\r\ngrowth of centuries in any European country. The contributions to the\r\nwar, whether of men or money, have been incredible. And there is no\r\nstint and no grumbling. The large heart is as large and generous as\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe war has, however, despite all our efforts, become an almost settled\r\ninstitution. This is a pity--we all feel it bitterly, and begin to grow\r\nserious. Still there is no flinching. Flinching will not help; we must\r\ngo on in the good cause, in God's name. 'Shall there not be clouds as\r\nwell as sunshine?' 'Go in, then'--that is agreed upon. Draft your men,\r\nPresident Lincoln; raise your money, Mr. Chase, we are ready. To the\r\nlast man and the last dollar we are ready. History shall speak of the\r\nAmerican of this day as one who was as willing to spend money for\r\nnational honor as he was earnest and keen in gathering it up for private\r\nemolument. Go ahead!\r\n\r\nBut let us do every thing advisedly and wisely.\r\n\r\nIn the first flush of war, it was not necessary to look so closely at\r\nthe capital. We pulled out our loose change and bank-notes, and\r\nscattered them bravely--as we should. Now that more and still more are\r\nneeded, we should look about to see how to turn every thing to best\r\naccount. For instance, there is the matter of soldiers. Those who rose\r\nin 1861, and went impulsively to battle, acted gloriously--even more\r\nnoble will it be with every volunteer who _now_, after hearing of the\r\nhorrors of war, still resolutely and bravely shoulders the musket and\r\ndares fate. God sends these times to the world and to men as 'jubilees'\r\nin which all who have lost an estate, be it of a calling or a social\r\nposition, may regain it or win a new one.\r\n\r\nBut still we want to present _every_ inducement. Already the lame and\r\ncrippled soldiers are beginning to return among us. The poor souls,\r\nragged and sun-burnt, may be seen at every corner. They sit in the parks\r\nwith unhealed wounds; they hobble along the streets, many of them weary\r\nand worn; poor fellows! they are greater, and more to be envied than\r\nmany a fresh fopling who struts by. And the people feel this. They treat\r\nthem kindly, and honor them.\r\n\r\nBut would it not be well if some general action could be adopted on the\r\nsubject of taking care of all the incurables which this war is so\r\nrapidly sending us? If every township in America would hold meetings and\r\nprovide honorably in some way for the returned crippled soldiers, they\r\nwould assume no great burden, and would obviate the most serious\r\ndrawback which the country is beginning to experience as regards\r\nobtaining volunteers. It has already been observed by the press, that\r\nthe scattering of these poor fellows over the country is beginning to\r\nhave a discouraging effect on those who should enter the army. It is a\r\npity; we would very gladly ignore the fact, and continue to treat the\r\nquestion solely _con entusiasmo_, and as at first; but what is the use\r\nof endeavoring to shirk facts which will only weigh more heavily in the\r\nend from being inconsidered now? Let us go to work generously,\r\ngreat-heartedly, and good-naturedly, to render the life of every man who\r\nhas been crippled for the country as little of a burden as possible.\r\n\r\nDear readers, it will not be sufficient to guarantee to these men a\r\npauper's portion among you. I do not pretend to say what you should give\r\nthem, or what you should do for them. I only know that there are but two\r\nnations on the face of the earth capable of holding town-meetings and\r\nacting by spontaneous democracy for themselves. One of these is\r\nrepresented by the Russian serfs, who administer their _mir_ or\r\n'commune' with a certain beaver-like instinct, providing for every man\r\nhis share of land, his social position, his rights, so far as they are\r\nable. The Englishman, or German, or Frenchman, is _not_ capable of this\r\nnatural town-meeting sort of action. He needs 'laws,' and government,\r\nand a lord or a squire in the chair, or a demagogue on the rostrum. The\r\npoor serf does it by custom and instinct.\r\n\r\nThe Bible Communism of the Puritans, and the habit of discussing all\r\nmanner of secular concerns in meeting, originated this same ability in\r\nAmerica. To this, more than to aught else, do we owe the growth of our\r\ncountry. One hundred Americans, transplanted to the wild West and left\r\nalone, will, in one week, have a mayor, and 'selectmen,' a town-clerk,\r\nand in all probability a preacher and an editor. One hundred Russian\r\nserfs will not rise so high as this; but leave them alone in the steppe,\r\nand they will organize a _mir_, elect a _starosta_, or 'old man,' divide\r\ntheir land very honestly, and take care of the cripples!\r\n\r\nSuch nations, but more especially the American, can find out for\r\nthemselves, much better than any living editor can tell them, how to\r\nprovide liberally for those who fought while they remained at home. The\r\nwriter may suggest to them the subject--they themselves can best 'bring\r\nit out.'\r\n\r\nIn trials like these it is very essential that our habits of meeting,\r\ndiscussing and practically acting on such measures, should be more\r\ndeveloped than ever. We have come to the times which _test_ republican\r\ninstitutions, and to crises when the public meeting--the true\r\ncorner-stone of all our practical liberties--should be brought most\r\nboldly, freely, and earnestly into action. Politics and feuds should\r\nvanish from every honorable and noble mind, and all unite in cordial\r\ncoöperation for the good work. Friends, there is _nothing_ you can not\r\ndo, if you would only get together, inspire one another, and do your\r\n_very best_. You could raise an army which would drive these rebel\r\nrascals howling into their Dismal Swamps, or into Mexico, in a month, if\r\nyou would only combine in earnest and do all you can.\r\n\r\nHitherto the man of ease, and the Respectable, disgusted by the\r\npoliticians, has neglected such meetings, and left them too much to the\r\nBlackguard to manage after his own way. But this is a day of politics no\r\nlonger; at least, those who try to engineer the war with a view to the\r\nnext election, are in a fair way to be ranked with the enemies of the\r\ncountry, and to earn undying infamy. The only politics which the honest\r\nman now recognizes is, the best way to save the country; to raise its\r\narmies and fight its battles. It is not McClellan or anti-McClellan,\r\nwhich we should speak of, but anti-Secession. And paramount among the\r\nprincipal means of successfully continuing the war, I place this, of\r\nproperly caring for the disabled soldier, and of placing before those\r\nwho have not as yet enlisted, the fact, that come what may, they will be\r\nwell looked after, for life.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the common-sense of our minor municipalities will abundantly\r\nprovide for these poor fellows, if a spirit can be awakened which shall\r\nsweep over the country and induce the meetings to be held. In many,\r\nsomething has already been done. But something liberal and large is\r\nrequisite. Government will undoubtedly do its share; and this, if\r\nproperly done, will greatly relieve our local commonwealths. Here,\r\nindeed, we come to a very serious question, which has been already\r\ndiscussed in these pages--more boldly, as we are told, than our\r\ncotemporaries have cared to treat it, and somewhat in advance of others.\r\nWe refer to our original proposition to liberally divide Southern lands\r\namong the army, and convert the retired soldier to a small planter. Such\r\nmen would very soon contrive to hire the 'contraband,' get him to\r\nworking, and make something better of him than planterocracy ever did.\r\nAt least, this is what Northern ship-captains and farmers contrive to\r\ndo, in their way, with numbers of coal-black negroes, and we have no\r\ndoubt that the soldier-planter will manage, 'somehow,' to get out a\r\ncotton-crop, even with the aid of hired negroes! Here, again, a bounty\r\ncould be given to the wounded. Observe, we mean a bounty which shall, to\r\nas high a degree as is possible or expedient, fully recompense a man for\r\nlosing a limb. And as we can find in Texas alone, land sufficient to\r\nnobly reward a vast proportion of our army, it will be seen that I do\r\nnot propose any excessive or extravagant reward.\r\n\r\nBetween our municipalities and our government, _much_ should be done.\r\nBut will not this prove a two-stool system of relief, between which the\r\ndisbanded soldier would fall to the ground? Not necessarily. Let our\r\ntowns and villages do their share, pledging themselves to take _good_\r\ncare of the disabled veteran, and to find work for all until Government\r\nshall apportion the lands of the conquered among the army.\r\n\r\nAnd let all this be done _soon_. Let it forthwith form a part of the\r\nlong cried for 'policy' which is to inspire our people. If this had been\r\na firmly determined thing from the beginning, and if we had _dared_ to\r\ngo bravely on with it, instead of being terrified at every proposal to\r\n_act_, by the yells and howls of the Northern secessionists, we might\r\nhave cleared Dixie out as fire clears tow. 'The enemy,' said one who had\r\nbeen among them, 'have the devil in them.' If our men had something\r\nsolid to look forward to, they too, would have the devil in them, and no\r\nmistake. They fight bravely as it is, without much inducement beyond\r\npatriotism and a noble cause. But the 'secesh' soldier has more than\r\nthis--he has the desperation of a traitor in a bad cause, of a fanatic\r\nand of a natural savage. It is no slur at the patriotism of our troops\r\nto say that they would fight better for such a splendid inducement as\r\nwe hold out.\r\n\r\nWe may as well do all we can for the army--at home and away, here and\r\nthere, with all our hearts and souls. For it will come to that sooner or\r\nlater. The army is a terrible power, and its power has been, and is to\r\nbe, terribly exerted. If we would organize it betimes, prevent it from\r\nbecoming a social trouble, or rather make of it a great social support\r\nand a _help_ instead of a future hindrance and a drag, we must be busy\r\nat work providing for it. There it is--destined, perhaps, to rise to a\r\nmillion--the flower, strength, and intellect of America, our productive\r\nforce, our brain--yes, the great majority of our mills, and looms, and\r\nprinting-presses, and all that is capital-producing, are there, in those\r\nuniforms. There, friends, lie towns and cities, towers and palace-halls,\r\nliterature and national life--for there are the brains and arms which\r\nmake these things. Those uniforms are not to be, at least, _should not_\r\nbe, forever there. But manage meanly and weakly and stingily _now_, and\r\nyou destroy the cities and fair castles, the uniform remains in the\r\nmyriad ranks, war becomes interminable, the soldier becomes nothing but\r\na soldier--God avert the day!--and you will find yourself some day\r\ntelling your grand-children--if you have any, for I can inform you that\r\nthe chances of war diminish many other chances--how 'things _might_ have\r\nbeen, and how finely we _might_ have conquered the enemy and had an\r\nundivided country--God bless us!'\r\n\r\nWill the WOMEN of America take no active part in this movement?\r\n\r\nMany years ago, a German writer--one Kirsten--announced the\r\nextraordinary fact, that in the Atlantic States the proportion of women\r\nwho died unmarried, or of 'old maids,' was larger than in any European\r\ncountry. It is certainly true that, owing to the high standard of\r\nexpenses adopted by the children of respectable American parents--and\r\nwhat American is not 'respectable'?--we are far less apt to rush into\r\n'imprudent' marriages than is generally supposed. But what proportion of\r\nunmarried dames will there be, if drafting continues, and the war\r\nbecomes a permanent annual subject of draft? The prospect is seriously\r\nand simply frightful! The wreck of morality in France caused by\r\nNapoleon's wars is notorious, for previous to that time the French\r\npeasantry were not so debauched as they subsequently became. But this\r\nshocking subject requires no comment.\r\n\r\nOn with the war! Drive it, push it, send it howling and hissing on like\r\nthe wild tornado, like the mad levin-brand, right into the foe! Pay the\r\nsoldier--promise--pledge--do any thing and every thing; but raise an\r\noverwhelming force, and end the war.\r\n\r\nUp and fight!\r\n\r\nIt is better to die now than see such disaster as awaits this country if\r\nwar become a fixed disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEER BOYS. [1750.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Hence with the lover who sighs o'er his wine,\r\n    Chloes and Phillises toasting;\r\n  Hence with the slave who will whimper and whine,\r\n    Of ardor and constancy boasting;\r\n            Hence with Love's joys,\r\n            Follies and noise.\r\n    The toast that _I_ give is: 'The Volunteer Boys!''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR-BORROWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulwer, in narrating the literary career of a young Chinese, states how\r\none of his works was very severely handled by the Celestial critics: one\r\nof the gravest of the charges brought against it by these poll-shaved,\r\nwooden-shod, little-foot-worshiping, Great-Wall-building mandarins of\r\nliterature being its extreme originality! They denounced Fihoti as\r\nhaving sinned the unpardonable literary sin of writing a book, a large\r\nshare of whose ideas was nowhere to be found in the writings of\r\nConfucius.\r\n\r\nBut how strange such a charge would sound in our English ears! With us,\r\nif between two authors the most remote resemblance of idea or expression\r\ncan be detected, straightway some ultraist stickler for\r\noriginality--some Poe--shrieks out, 'Some body must be a thief!' and\r\nforthwith, all along the highways of reviewdom, is sent up the hue and\r\ncry: 'Stop thief! stop thief!' For has not the law thundered from Sinai,\r\n'Thou shalt not steal'? True, plagiarism is nowhere distinctly forbidden\r\nby Moses; but have not critics judicially pronounced it author-_theft_?\r\nHas not metaphor been sounded through every note of its key-board, to\r\nstrike out all that is base whereunto to liken it? Have not old Dr.\r\nJohnson's seven-footed words--the tramp of whose heavy brogans has\r\nechoed down the staircase of years even unto our day--declared\r\nplagiarists from the works of buried writers 'jackals, battening on dead\r\nmen's thoughts'?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, after a vast deal of such like catachresis, the orthodoxy of\r\nplagiarism remains still in dispute. What we incorporate among the\r\ncardinal articles of literary faith, China abjures as a dangerous\r\nheresy. But neither our own nor the Chinese creed consists wholly of\r\ntested bullion, but is crude ore, in which the pure gold of truth is\r\nmingled with the dross of error. That is a golden tenet of the\r\ntea-growers which licenses the borrowing of ideas; that 'of the earth,\r\nearthy,' which embargoes every one unborrowed. We build upon a rock when\r\ninterdicting plagiarism; but on sand when we make that term inclose\r\nauthor-theft and author-borrowing. The making direct and unacknowledged\r\nquotations, and palming them off as the quoter's, is a very grave\r\nliterary offense. But the expression of similar or even identical\r\nthoughts in different language, in this age of the world must be\r\ntolerated, or else the race of authors soon become as extinct as that of\r\nbehemoths and ichthyosauri; and, indeed, far from levying any imposts\r\nupon author-borrowing, rather ought we to vote bounties and pensions to\r\nencourage it.\r\n\r\nOriginality of thought with men is impossible. There is in existence a\r\ncertain amount of thought, but it all belongs to God. Lord paramount\r\nover the empire of mind as well as matter, he alone is seized, in fee\r\nsimple right, of the whole domain: provinces of which men hold, as\r\nfiefs, by vassal tenure, subject to reversion and enfeoffment to\r\nanother. Nor can any man absolve himself from his allegiance, and extend\r\nabsolute sovereignty over broad tracts of idea-territory; for while\r\nfeudal princes vested in themselves, by conquest merely, the ownership\r\nof kingdoms, God became suzerain over the empire of thought by virtue of\r\ncreation--for creation confers right of property. We do not, then,\r\noriginate the thoughts we call our own; or else Pantheism tells no lie\r\nwhen it declares that man is God, for the differentia which\r\ndistinguishes God from man is absolute creative power. And if man be\r\nthought-creative, he can as well as God give being unto what was\r\nnon-existent, and that, too, not mere gross, perishable matter, but\r\nimmortal soul; for thought is mind, and mind is spirit, soul, undying,\r\nimmortal. Grant that, and you divide God's empire, and enthrone the\r\ncreature in equal sovereignty beside his Maker.\r\n\r\nAll thought, then, belongs exclusively to God, and is parceled out by\r\nhim, as he chooses, among his creature feudatories. As the wind, which\r\nbloweth where it listeth, and no one knoweth whence it cometh, save that\r\nit is sent by God, so is thought, as it blows through our minds. Over\r\nbirds, flying at liberty through the free air, boys often advance claims\r\nof ownership more specific than are easily derived from the general\r\ndominion God gave man over the beasts of the field and the birds of the\r\nair; yet, 'All those birds are mine!' exclaims a youngster in\r\nroundabout, with just as much reason as any man can claim, as\r\nexclusively his own, the thoughts which are ever winging their way\r\nthrough the firmament of mind.\r\n\r\nBut considered apart from the relation we sustain to God, none of us are\r\noriginal with respect to our fellow-men. Few, indeed, are the ideas we\r\nderive by direct grant, or through nature, from our liege lord; but far\r\nthe greater share, by hooks or personal contact, we gather through our\r\nfellow-men. Consciously, unconsciously, we all teach--we all learn from,\r\none another. Association does far more toward forming mind than natural\r\nendowments. As not alone the soil whence it springs makes the oak, but\r\nsurrounding elements contribute. Seclude a human mind entirely from\r\nhooks and men, and you may have a man with no ideas borrowed from his\r\nfellows. Such a one, in Germany, once grew up from childhood to manhood\r\nin close imprisonment, and poor Kasper Hauser proved--an idiot. It can\r\nhardly be necessary to suggest the well-known fact, that the greatest\r\nreaders of men and books always possess the greatest minds. Such are,\r\nbesides, of the greatest service to mankind. For since God has so formed\r\nus that we love to give as well as take, a great independent mind,\r\ncomplete in itself and incapable of receiving from others, must always\r\nstand somewhat apart from men; and even a great heart, when\r\nconjoined--as it seldom is--with a great head, is rarely able to\r\ndrawbridge over the wide moat which intrenches it in solitary\r\nloneliness. Originality ever links with it something of\r\nuncongeniality--a feeling somewhat akin to the egotism of that one who,\r\nwhen asked why he talked so much to himself, replied--for two reasons:\r\nthe one, that he liked to talk to a sensible man; the other, that he\r\nliked to hear a sensible man talk. Divorcing itself from\r\nfellow-sympathies, it broods over its own perfections, till, like\r\nNarcissus, it falls in love with itself. And so, a highly original man\r\ncan rarely ever be a highly popular man or author. By the very\r\nsuper-abundance of his excellencies, his usefulness is destroyed; just\r\nas Tarpeia sank, buried beneath the presents of the Sabine soldiery. A\r\nMan once appeared on earth, of perfect originality; and in him, to an\r\nunbounded intellect was added boundless moral power. But men received\r\nhim not. They rejected his teachings; they smote him; they crucified\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut though the right of eminent domain over ideas does and should inhere\r\nin one superior to us, far different is the case with words. These\r\n'incarnations of thought' are of man's device, and therefore his; and\r\nstyle--the peculiar manner in which one uses words to express ideas--is\r\nindividually personal. Indeed, style has been defined the man himself; a\r\ndefinition, so far as he is recognized only as a revealer of thought,\r\nsubstantially correct. In an idea word-embodied, the embodier, then,\r\npossesses with God concurrent ownership. The idea itself may be\r\nborrowed, or it may be his so far as discovery gives title; but the\r\nwords, in their arrangement, are absolutely his. All ideas are like\r\nmathematical truths: eternal and unchangeable in their essence, and\r\noriginate in nature; words like figures, of a fixed value, but of human\r\ninvention; and sentences are formulæ, embodying oftentimes the same\r\nessential truth, but in shapes as various as their paternity. Words, in\r\nsentences, should then be inviolate to their author.\r\n\r\nNor is this to value words above ideas--the flesh above the spirit of\r\nwhich it is but the incarnation. It is not the intrinsic value of each\r\nthat we here regard, but the value of the ownership one has in each.\r\n'Deacon Giles and I,' said a poor man, 'own more cows than any five\r\nother men in the county.' 'How many does Deacon Giles own?' asked a\r\nbystander. 'Nineteen.' 'And how many do you?' 'One.' And that one cow,\r\nwhich that poor man owned, was worth more to _him_ than the nineteen\r\nwhich were Deacon Giles's. So, when you have determined whose the style\r\nis which enfolds a thought, whose the thought is, is as little worth\r\ndispute as, after its wrappage of corn has been shelled off, the cob's\r\nownership is worth a quarrel.\r\n\r\nAs thoughts bodied in words uttered make up conversation, thought\r\nincarnate in words written constitutes literature. The gross sum of\r\nthought with which God has seen to dower the human mind, though vast, is\r\nfinite, and may be exhausted. Indeed, we are told this had been already\r\ndone so long ago as times whereof Holy Writ takes cognizance. Since that\r\ntime, then, men have been echoing and reëchoing the same old ideas. And\r\nthough words, too, are finite, their permutations are infinite. What\r\nHimalayan piles of paper, river-coursed by Danubes and Niagaras of ink,\r\nhath the 'itch of writing' aggregated! And yet, Ganganelli says that\r\nevery thing that man has ever written might be contained within six\r\nthousand folio volumes, if filled with only original matter. But how\r\nbooks lie heaped on one another, weighing down those under, weighed down\r\nby those above them; each crushed and crushing; their thoughts, like\r\nbones of skeletons corded in convent vault, mingled in confusion--like\r\nthose which Hawthorne tells us Miriam saw in the burial-cellar of the\r\nCapuchin friars in Rome, where, when a dead brother had lain buried an\r\nallotted period, his remains, removed from earth to make room for a\r\nsuccessor, were piled with those of others who had died before him.\r\n\r\nIt is said Aurora once sought and gained from Jove the boon of\r\nimmortality for one she loved; but forgetting to request also perpetual\r\nyouth, Tithonus gradually grew old, his thin locks whitened, his wasting\r\nframe dwindled to a shadow, and his feeble voice thinned down till it\r\nbecame inaudible. And just so ideas, although immortal, were it not for\r\nauthor-borrowers, through age grown obsolete, might virtually perish.\r\nBut by and by, just as some precious thought is being lost unto the\r\nworld, let there come some Medea, by whose potent sorcery that old and\r\nwithered idea receives new life-blood through its shrunken veins, and it\r\nstarts to life again with recreated vigor--another Æson, with the bloom\r\nof youth upon him. Besides in this way playing the physician to save old\r\nideas from a burial alive, the author-borrower often delivers many a\r\nprolific mother-thought of a whole family of children--as a prism from\r\nout a parent ray of colorless light brings all the bright colors of the\r\nspectrum, which, from red to violet, were all waiting there only for its\r\nassistance to leap into existence; or sometimes he plays the parson,\r\nwedlocking thoughts from whose union issue new; as from yellow wedded to\r\nred springs orange, a new, a secondary life; or enacts, maybe, the\r\nbrood-hen's substitute. Many a thought is a Leda egg, imprisoning twin\r\nlife-principles, which,, incubated in the eccaleobion brain of an\r\nauthor-borrower, have blessed the world; but without such a\r\nfoster-parent, in some neglected nest staled and addled, had never burst\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nAuthor-borrowing should also be encouraged, because it tends to\r\nlanguage's perfection, and thus to incrementing the value of the ideas\r\nit vehicles; for though a gilding diction and elegant expression may not\r\ndirectly increase a thought's intrinsic worth, yet by bestowing beauty\r\nit increases its utility, and so adds relative value--just as a rosewood\r\nveneering does to a basswood table. There may be as much raw timber in a\r\nslab as in a bunch of shingles, but the latter is worth the most; it\r\nwill find a purchaser where the former would not. So there may be as\r\nmuch truly valuable thought in a dull sermon as in a lively lecture;\r\nbut the lecture will please, and so instruct, where the dull sermon will\r\nfall on an inattentive ear. Moreover, author minds are of two classes,\r\nthe one deep-thinking, the other word-adroit. Providence bestows her\r\nfavors frugally; and with the power of quarrying out huge lumps of\r\nthought, ability to work them over into graceful form is rarely given.\r\nThis is no new doctrine, but a truth clearly recognized in metaphysics,\r\nand evidenced in history. Cromwell was a prodigious thinker; but in\r\nlanguage, oh! how deficient. His thoughts, struggling to force\r\nthemselves out of that sphynx-like jargon which he spake and wrote,\r\nappear like the treasures of the shipwrecked Trojans, swimming '_rari in\r\ngurgite vasto_'--Palmyra columns, reared in the midst of a desert of\r\nsentences. And Coleridge--than whom in the mines of mental science few\r\nhave dug deeper, and though Xerxes-hosts of word-slaves waited on his\r\npen--often wrote apparently mere bagatelle--the most transcendental\r\nnonsense. Yet he who takes the pains to husk away his obscurity of style\r\nwill find solid ears of thought to recompense his labor. Bentham and\r\nKant required interpreters--Dumont and Cousin--to make understood what\r\nwas well worth understanding. These two kinds of\r\nauthors--thought-creditors and borrowing expressionists--are as mutually\r\nnecessary to each other to bring out idea in its most perfect shape, as\r\nglass and mercury to mirror objects. Dim, indeed, is the reflection of\r\nthe glass without its coating of quicksilver; and amalgam, without a\r\nplate on which to spread it, can never form a mirror. The metal and the\r\nsilex are\r\n\r\n  'Useless each without the other;'\r\n\r\nbut wed them, and from their union spring life-like images of life.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected that in trying to improve a thought we often mar\r\nit; just as in transplanting shrubs from the barren soil in which they\r\nhave become fast rooted, to one more fertile, we destroy them. 'Just as\r\nthe fabled lamps in the tomb of Terentia burned underground for ages,\r\nbut when removed into the light of day, went out in darkness.' That this\r\nsometimes occurs, we own. Some ideas are as fragile as butterflies, whom\r\nto handle is to destroy. But such are exceptions only, and should not\r\npreclude attempts at improvement. If a bungler tries and fails, let him\r\nbe Anathema, Maranathema; but let not his failure deter from trial a\r\ngenuine artist. Nor is it an ignoble office to be thus shapers only of\r\ngreat thinkers' thoughts--Python interpreters to oracles. Nor is his\r\nwork of slight account who thus--as sunbeams gift dark thunder-clouds\r\nwith 'silver lining' and a fringe of purple, as Time with ivy drapes a\r\nrugged wall--hangs the beauties of expression round a rude but sterling\r\nthought. Nay, oftentimes the shaper's labor is worth more than the\r\nthought he shapes. For if the stock out of which the work is wrought be\r\never more valuable than the workman's skill, then let canvas and\r\npaint-pots impeach the fame of Raphael; rough blocks from Paros and\r\nPentelicus, the gold and ivory of the Olympian Jove; tear from the brow\r\nof Phidias the laurel wreath with which the world has crowned him.\r\nSupply of raw material is little without the ability to use it. Furnish\r\nthree men with stone and mortar, and while one is building an unsightly\r\nheap of clumsy masonry, the architect will rear up a magnificent\r\ncathedral--an Angelo, a St. Peter's. And so when ideas, which in their\r\ncrudeness are often as hard to be digested as unground corn, are run\r\nthrough the mill of another's mind, and appear in a shape suited to\r\nsatisfy the most dyspeptic stomachs, does not the miller deserve a toll?\r\n\r\nFinally, author-borrowing has been hallowed by its practice, in their\r\nfirst essays, by all our greatest writers. Turn to the scroll on which\r\nthe world has written the names of those it holds as most illustrious.\r\nHow was it with him whom English readers love to call the\r\n'myriad-minded?' Shakespeare began by altering old plays, and his\r\nindebtedness to history and old legends is by no means slight. How with\r\nhim who sang 'of man's first disobedience' and exodus from Eden? Even\r\nMilton did not, Elijah-like, draw down his fire direct from heaven, but\r\nkindled with brands, borrowed from Greek and Hebrew altars, the\r\ninspiration which sent up the incense-poetry of a Lost Paradise. And all\r\nthe while that Maro sang 'Arms and the Man,' a refrain from the harp of\r\nHomer was sounding in his ears, unto whose tones so piously he keyed and\r\nmeasured his own notes, that oftentimes we fancy we can hear the strains\r\nof 'rocky Scio's blind old bard' mingling in the Mantuan's melody. If\r\nthus it has been with those who sit highest and fastest on\r\nParnassus--the crowned kings of mind--how has it been with the mere\r\nnobility? What are Scott's poetic romances, but blossomings of engrafted\r\nscions on that slender shoot from out the main trunk of English\r\npoetry--the old border balladry? Campbell's polished elegance of style,\r\nand the 'ivory mechanism of his verse,' was born the natural child of\r\nBeattie and Pope. Byron had Gifford in his eye when he wrote 'English\r\nBards and Scotch Reviewers,' and Spenser when he penned the\r\n'Pilgrimage.' Pope, despairing of originality, and taking Dryden for his\r\nmodel, sought only to polish and to perfect. Gray borrowed from Spenser,\r\nSpenser from Chaucer, Chaucer from Dante, and Dante had ne'er been Dante\r\nbut for the old Pagan mythology. Sterne and Hunt and Keats were only\r\n\r\n  Bees, in their own volumes hiving\r\n  Borrowed sweets from others' gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it ever is. The inceptions of true genius are always\r\nessentially imitations. A great writer does not begin by ransacking for\r\nthe odd and new. He re-models--betters. Trusting not hypotheses\r\nunproven, he demonstrates himself the proposition ere he wagers his\r\nfaith on the corollary; and it is thus that in time he grows to be a\r\ndiscoverer, an inventor, an _originator_.\r\n\r\nToward originality all should steer; but can only hope to reach it\r\nthrough imitation. For if originality be the Colchis where the golden\r\nfleece of immortality is won, imitation must be the Argo in which we\r\nsail thither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Intervene! and see what you'll catch\r\n  In a powder-mill with a lighted match.\r\n  Intervene! if you think fit,\r\n  By jumping into the bottomless pit.\r\n  Intervene! How you'll gape and gaze\r\n  When you see all Europe in a blaze!\r\n  Russia gobbling your world half in,\r\n  Red Republicans settling with _sin_;\r\n  Satan broke loose and nothing between--\r\n  _That's_ what you'll catch if you intervene!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'A REEL TITIANO FOR SAL.'\r\n\r\nThere was a shop occupied by a dealer in paintings, engravings,\r\nintaglios, old crockery, and _Bric-à-brac_-ery generally, down the Via\r\nCondotti, and into this shop Mr. William Browne, of St. Louis, one\r\nmorning found his way. He had been induced to enter by reading in the\r\nwindow, written on a piece of paper,\r\n\r\n'A REEL TITIANO FOR SAL,'\r\n\r\nand as he wisely surmised that the dealer intended to notify the English\r\nthat he had a painting by Titian for sale, he went in to see it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Mr. Browne, familiarly known as Uncle Bill, he had one\r\nof those faces that invariably induced Roman tradesmen to resort to the\r\nOriental mode of doing business, namely, charging three hundred per cent\r\nprofit; and as this dealer having formerly been a courier,\r\ncommissionaire and pander to English and American travelers, naturally\r\nspoke a disgusting jargon of Italianized English, and had what he\r\nbelieved were the most distinguished manners: _he_ charged five hundred\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n'I want,' said Uncle Bill to the 'brick-Bat' man, 'to see your Titian.'\r\n\r\n'I shall expose 'im to you in one moment, sare; you walk this way. He's\r\nvar' fine pickshoor, var' fine. You ben long time in Rome, sare?'\r\n\r\nNo reply from Uncle Bill: his idea was, even a wise man may ask\r\nquestions, but none but fools answer fools.\r\n\r\nBrick-bat man finds that his customer has ascended the human scale one\r\nstep; he prepares 'to spring dodge' Number two on him.\r\n\r\n'Thare, sar, thare is Il Tiziano! I spose you say you see notheeng bote\r\nlarge peas board: zat peas board was one táble for two, tree hundret\r\nyars; all zat time ze pickshoor was unbeknounst undair ze táble. Zey\r\ntorn up ze table, and you see a none-doubted Tiziano. Var' fine\r\npickshoor!'\r\n\r\n'Do you know,' asked Uncle Bill, 'if it was in a temperance family all\r\nthat time?'\r\n\r\n'I am not acquent zat word, demprance--wot it means?'\r\n\r\n'Sober,' was the answer.\r\n\r\n'Yas, zat was in var' sobair fam'ly--in convent of nons.'\r\n\r\n'That will account for its being undiscovered so long--all the world\r\nknows they are not inquisitive! If it had been in a drinking-house, some\r\nbody falling under the table would have seen it--wouldn't they?'\r\n\r\nBrick-bat reflects, and comes to the conclusion that the 'eldairly cove'\r\nis wider-awake than he believed him, at first sight.\r\n\r\n'Now I torne zis board you see on ze othaire side, ze Bella Donna of\r\nTiziano. Zere is one in ze Sciarra palace, bote betwane you and I, I\r\ndon't believe it is gin'wine.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know much about paintings,' spoke Uncle Bill, 'but I know I've\r\nseen seventy-six of these Belli Donners, and each one was sworn to as\r\nthe original picture!'\r\n\r\n'Var' true, sare, var' true, Tiziano Vermecellio was grate pantaire, man\r\nof grate mind, and when he got holt onto fine subjick he work him ovair\r\nand ovair feefty, seexty times. Ze chiaro-'scuro is var' fine, and ze\r\ndepfs of his tone somethings var' deep, vary. Look at ze flaish, sare,\r\nyou can pinch him, and, sare, you look here, I expose grand secret to\r\nyou. I take zis pensnife, I scratgis ze pant. Look zare!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Uncle Bill, 'I don't see any thing.'\r\n\r\n'You don't see anne theengs! Wot you see under ze pant?'\r\n\r\n'It looks like dirt.'\r\n\r\n'_Cospetto!_ zat is ze gr-and prep-par-ra-tion zat makes ze flaish of\r\nTiziano more natooral as life. You know grate pantaire, Mistaire Leaf,\r\nas lives in ze Ripetta? Zat man has spend half his lifes scratging\r\nTiziano all to peases, for find out 'ow he mak's flaish: now he believes\r\nhe found out ze way, bote, betwane you and I----' Here the Brick-bat\r\nman conveyed, by a shake of his head and a tremolo movement of his left\r\nhand, the idea that 'it was all in vain.'\r\n\r\n'What do you ask for the picture?' asked Uncle Bill\r\n\r\nThe head of the Brick-bat man actually disappeared between his shoulders\r\nas he shrugged them up, and extended his hands at his sides like the\r\nflappers of a turtle. Uncle Bill looked at the man in admiration; he had\r\nnever seen such a performance before, save by a certain contortionist in\r\na traveling circus, and in his delight he asked the man, when his head\r\nappeared, if he wouldn't do that once more, only once more!\r\n\r\nIn his surprise at being asked to perform the trick, he actually went\r\nthrough it again. For which, Uncle Bill thanked him, kindly, and again\r\nasked the price of the Titian.\r\n\r\n'I tak' seex t'ousand scudi for him, not one baiocch less.'\r\n\r\n'It an't dear,'specially for those who have the money to\r\nscatterlophisticate,' replied Uncle Bill cheerfully.\r\n\r\n'No, sare, it ees dogs chip, var' chip. I have sevral Englis' want to\r\nbuy him bad; I shall sell him some days to some bodies. Bote, sare, will\r\nyou 'ave ze goodniss to write down on peas paper zat word, var' fine\r\nword, you use him minit 'go--scatolofistico sometheengs--I wis' to larn\r\nze Englis' better as I spiks him.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly; give me a pencil and paper, I'll write it down, and you'll\r\nastonish some Englishman with it, I'll bet a hat.'\r\n\r\nSo it was written down; and if any one ever entered a shop in the\r\nCondotti where there was a Titiano for Sal, and was 'astonished' by\r\nhearing that word used, they may know whence it came.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne, after carefully examining the usual yellow marble model of\r\nthe column of Trajan, the alabaster pyramid of Caius Cestius, the verd\r\nantique obelisks, the bronze lamps, lizards, marble _tazze_, and\r\npaste-gems of the modern-antique factories, the ever-present Beatrice\r\nCenci on canvas, and the water-color costumes of Italy, made a purchase\r\nof a Roman mosaic paper-weight, wherein there was a green parrot with a\r\nred tail and blue legs, let in with minute particles of composition\r\nresembling stone, and left the Brick-bat man alone with his Titiano for\r\nSal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO LONG!\r\n\r\nRocjean came into Caper's studio one morning, evidently having something\r\nto communicate.\r\n\r\n'Are you busy this morning? If not, come along with me; there is\r\nsomething to be seen--something that beats the Mahmoudy Canal of the\r\nPast, or the Suez Canal of the Present, for wholesale slaughter; for I\r\ndo assure you, on the authority of Hassel, that nine hundred and\r\nthirty-six million four hundred and sixty-one thousand people died\r\nbefore it was finished!'\r\n\r\n'That must be a work worth looking at. Why, the Pyramids must be as\r\nanthills to Chimborazo in comparison to it! Nine hundred and odd\r\nmillions of mortals! Why, that is about the number dying in a\r\ngeneration--and these have passed away while it was being completed? It\r\nought to be a master-piece.'\r\n\r\n'Can't we get a glass of wine round here?' asked Rocjean, looking at his\r\nwatch; 'it is about luncheon-time, and I have a charming little thirst.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes, there is a wine-shop only three doors from here, pure Roman.\r\nLet us go: we can stand out in the street and drink if you are afraid to\r\ngo in.'\r\n\r\nLeaving the studio, they walked a few steps to a house that was\r\nliterally all front-door; for the entrance was the entire width of the\r\nbuilding, and a buffalo-team could have passed in without let. Outside\r\nstood a wine-cart, from which they were unloading several small casks\r\nof wine. The driver's seat had a hood over it, protecting him from the\r\nsun, as he lazily sleeps there, rumbling over the tufa road, to or from\r\nthe Campagna, and around the seat were painted in gay colors various\r\npatterns of things unknown. In the autumn, vine-branches with pendent,\r\nrustling leaves decorate hood and horse, while in spring or summer, a\r\nbunch of flowers often ornaments this gay-looking wine-cart.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the shop was dark, dingy, sombre, and dirty enough to\r\nhave thrown an old Flemish Interior artist into hysterics of delight.\r\nThere was an _olla podrida_ browniness about it that would have\r\nentranced a native of Seville; and a collection of dirt around, that\r\nwould have elevated a Chippeway Indian to an ecstasy of delight. The\r\nreed-mattings hung against the walls were of a gulden ochre-color, the\r\nsmoked walls and ceiling the shade of asphaltum and burnt sienna, the\r\nunswept stone pavement a warm gray, the old tables and benches very rich\r\nin tone and dirt; the back of the shop, even at midday, dark, and the\r\neye caught there glimpses of arches, barrels, earthen jars, tables and\r\nbenches resting in twilight, and only brought out in relief by the faint\r\nlight always burning in front of the shrine of the Virgin, that hung on\r\none of the walls.\r\n\r\nIn a wine-shop this shrine does not seem out of place, it is artistic;\r\nbut in a lottery-office, open to the light of day, and glaringly\r\ncommon-place, the Virgin hanging there looks much more like the goddess\r\nFortuna than Santa Maria.\r\n\r\nBut they are inside the wine-shop, and the next instant a black-haired\r\ngipsy-looking woman with flashing, black eyes, warming up the sombre\r\ncolor of the shop by the fiery red and golden silk handkerchief which\r\nfalls from the back of her head, Neapolitan fashion, illuminating that\r\ndusky old den like fireworks, asks them what they will order?\r\n\r\n'A foglietta of white wine.'\r\n\r\n'Sweet or dry?' she asks.\r\n\r\n'Dry,' (_asciùtto_,) said Rocjean.\r\n\r\nThere it is on the table, in a glass flask, brittle as virtue, light as\r\nsin, and fragile as folly. They are called Sixtusses, after that pious\r\nold Sixtus V. who hanged a publican and wine-seller sinner in front of\r\nhis shop for blasphemously expressing his opinion as to the correctness\r\nof charging four times as much to put the fluoric-acid government stamp\r\non them as the glass cost. However, taxes must be raised, and the\r\nthinner the glass the easier it is broken, so the Papal government\r\ncompel the wine-sellers to buy these glass bubbles, forbidding the sale\r\nof wine out of any thing else save the _bottiglie_; and as it raises\r\nmoney by touching them up with acid, why, the people have to stand it.\r\nThese _fogliette_ have round bodies and long, broad necks, on which you\r\nnotice a white mark made with the before-mentioned chemical preparation;\r\nup to this mark the wine should come, but the attendant generally takes\r\nthumb-toll, especially in the restaurants where foreigners go, for the\r\nRoman citizen is not to be swindled, and will have his rights: the\r\nsingle expression, 'I AM A ROMAN CITIZEN,' will at times save him at\r\nleast two _baiocchi_, with which he can buy a cigar. There was a time\r\nwhen these words would have checked the severest decrees of the highest\r\nmagistrate: now when they fire off 'that gun,' the French soldiers stand\r\nat its mouth, laugh, and say; '_Boom!_ you have no balls for your\r\ncartridges!'\r\n\r\nThe wine finished, our two artists took up their line of march for the\r\nobject that had outlived so many millions on millions of human beings,\r\nand at last reached it, discovering its abode afar off, by the crowd of\r\nfair-and unfair, or red-haired Saxons, who were thronging up a staircase\r\nof a house near the Ripetta, as if a steamboat were ringing her last\r\nbell and the plank were being drawn in.\r\n\r\n'And pray, can you tell me, Mister Buller, if it's a positive fact that\r\nthe man has been so long as they say, at work on the thing?'\r\n\r\n'And ah! I haven't the slightest doubt of it, myself. I've been told\r\nthat he has worked on it, to be sure, for full thirty years; and I may\r\nsay I am delighted, that he has it done at last, and that it is to be\r\npacked up and sent away to St. Petersburg next week. And how do you like\r\nthe Hotel Minerva? I think it's not a very dirty inn, but the waiters\r\nare very demanding, and the fleas--'\r\n\r\n'I beg you won't speak of them, it makes my blood run cold. Have you\r\nseen the last copy of _Galignani_? The Americans, I am glad to see, have\r\nhad trouble with us, and I hope they will be properly punished. Do you\r\nknow the Duke of Bigghed is in town?'\r\n\r\n'Really! and when did he come--and where is the Duchess? oh!--she's a\r\nvery amiable lady--but here's the picture!'\r\n\r\nUshered in, or preceded by this rattle-headed talk, Caper and Rocjean\r\nstood at last before Ivanhof's celebrated painting--finished at last!\r\nThirty years' work, and the result?\r\n\r\nA very unsatisfactory stream of water, a crowd of Orientals, and our\r\nSaviour descending a hill.\r\n\r\nThe general impression left on the mind after seeing it, was like that\r\nproduced by a wax-work show. Nature was travestied; ease, grace,\r\nfreedom, were wanting: evidently the thirty years might have been better\r\nspent collecting beetles or dried grasses.\r\n\r\nAround the walls of the studio hung sketches painted during visits the\r\nartist had made to the East. Here were studies of Eastern heads,\r\ncostumes, trees, soil by river-side, sand in the desert, copied with\r\nscrupulous care and precise truth, yet, when they were all together in\r\nthe great painting, the combined effect was a failure.\r\n\r\nThe artist, they said, had, during this long period, received an annual\r\npension of so many roubles from the Russian government, and had taken\r\nhis time about it. At last it was completed; the painting that had\r\noutlasted a generation was to be sent to St. Petersburg to hibernate\r\nafter a lifetime spent in sunny Italy. Well! after all, it was better\r\nworth the money paid for it than that paid for nine tenths of those\r\nkingly toys in the baby-house Green Chambers of Dresden. _Le Roi\r\ns'amuse!_\r\n\r\nAnd the white-haired Saxons came in shoals to the studio to see the\r\npainting with thirty years' labor on it, and accordingly as their\r\noracles had judged it, so did they: for behold! gay colors are tabooed\r\nin the mythology of the Pokerites, and are classed with perfumes,\r\ndance-music, and jollity, and art earns a precarious livelihood in their\r\nland, where all knowledge of it is supposed to be tied up with the\r\nenjoyers of primogeniture.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN THEATRES.\r\n\r\nThe Apollo, where grand opera, sandwiched with moral ballets, is given\r\nfor the benefit of foreigners, principally, would be a fine house if you\r\ncould only see it; but when Caper was in Rome, the oil-lamps, showing\r\nyou where to sit down, did not reveal its proportions, or the dresses of\r\nthe box-beauties, to any advantage; and as oil-lamps will smoke, there\r\nsettled a veil over the theatre towards the second act, that draped\r\nComedy like Tragedy, and then set her to coughing.\r\n\r\nDuring Carnival a melancholy ball or two was given there: a few wild\r\nforeigners venturing in masked, believed they had mistaken the house,\r\nfor although many women were wandering around in domino, they found the\r\nRoman young men unmasked, walking about dressed in canes and those\r\ndress-coats, familiarly known as tail-coats, which cause a man to look\r\nlike a swallow with the legs of a crane, and wearing on their impassive\r\nfaces the appearance of men waiting for an oyster-supper--or an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nThe commissionaire at the hotel always recommends strangers to go to the\r\nApollo: 'I will git you lôge, sare, first tier--more noble, sare.'\r\n\r\nThe Capranica Theatre is next in size and importance; it is beyond the\r\nPantheon, out of the foreign quarter of Rome, and you will find in it a\r\nRoman audience--to a limited extent. Salvini acted there in _Othello_,\r\nand filled the character admirably; it is needless to say that Iago\r\nreceived even more applause than Othello; Italians know such men\r\nprofoundly--they are Figaros turned undertakers. Opera was given at the\r\nCapranica when the Apollo was closed.\r\n\r\nThe Valle is a small establishment, where Romans, pure blood, of the\r\nmiddle class, and the nobility who did not hang on to foreigners, were\r\nto be found. Giuseppina Gassier, who has since sung in America, was\r\nprima-donna there, appearing generally in the _Sonnambula_.\r\n\r\nBut the Capranica Theatre was the resort for the Roman _minenti_, decked\r\nin all their bravery. Here came the shoemaker, the tailor, and the small\r\nartisan, all with their wives or women, and with them the wealthy\r\npeasant who had ten cents to pay for entrance. Here the audience wept\r\nand laughed, applauded the actors, and talked to each other from one\r\nside of the house to the other. Here the plays represented Roman life in\r\nthe rough, and were full of words and expressions not down in any\r\ndictionary or phrase-book; nor in these local displays were forgotten\r\nvarious Roman peculiarities of accentuation of words, and curious\r\nintonations of voice. The Roman people indulge in chest-notes, leaving\r\nhead-notes to the Neapolitans, who certainly do not possess such\r\nsmoothness of tongue as would classify them among their brethren in the\r\nold proverb: 'When the confusion of tongues happened at the building of\r\nthe Tower of Babel, if the Italian had been there, Nimrod would have\r\nmade him a plasterer!'\r\n\r\nYou will do well, if you want to learn from the stage and audience, the\r\nRoman _plebs_, their customs and language, to attend the Capranica\r\nTheatre often; to attend it in 'fatigue-dress,' and in gentle mood,\r\nbeing neither shocked nor astonished if a good-looking Roman youth\r\nshould call your attention to the fact that there is a beautiful girl in\r\nthe box to the left hand, and inquire if you know whether she is the\r\ndaughter of Santi Stefoni, the grocer? And should the man on the other\r\nside offer you some pumpkin-seeds to eat, by all means accept a few; you\r\ncan't tell what they may bring forth, if you will only plant them\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nDo not think it strange if a doctor on the stage recommends conserve of\r\nvipers to a consumptive patient; for these poisonous reptiles are caught\r\nin large numbers in the mountains back of Rome, and sold to the city\r\napothecaries, who prepare large quantities of them for their customers.\r\n\r\nWhen you see, perhaps the hero of the play, thrown into a paroxysm of\r\nanger and fiery wrath by some untoward event, proceed calmly to cut up\r\ntwo lemons, squeeze into a tumbler their juice, and then drink it\r\ndown--learn that it is a common Roman remedy for anger.\r\n\r\nOr if, when a piece of crockery, or other fragile article, may be\r\nbroken, you notice one of the actors carefully counting the pieces, do\r\nnot think it is done in order to reconstruct the article, but to guide\r\nhim in the purchase of a lottery-ticket.\r\n\r\nWhen you notice that on one of his hands the second finger is twined\r\nover the first, of the Rightful-heir in presence of the Wrongful-heir,\r\nyou may know that the first is guarding himself against the Evil Eye\r\nsupposed to belong to the second.\r\n\r\nAnd--the list could be extended to an indefinite length--you will learn\r\nmore, by going to the Capranica.\r\n\r\nAt the Metastasio Theatre there was a French vaudeville company,\r\npassably good, attended by a French audience, the majority officers and\r\nsoldiers. Here were presented such attractive plays as _La Femme qui\r\nMord_, or 'The Woman who Bites;' _Sullivan_, the hero of which gets\r\n_bien gris_, very gray, that is, blue, that is, very tipsy, and at the\r\nclose, astonishes the audience with the moral: To get tight is human!\r\n_Dalilah_, etc., etc. The French are not very well beloved by the Romans\r\npure and simple; it is not astonishing, therefore, that their language\r\nshould be laughed at. One morning Rome woke up to find placards all\r\nover the city, headed:\r\n\r\n  FRENCH\r\n\r\n  TAUGHT IN THIRTY-SIX LESSONS!\r\n\r\n  Apply to Monsieur SO-AND-SO.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward appeared a fearful wood-cut, the head of a jackass,\r\nwith his tongue hanging down several inches, and under it, these words,\r\nin Italian: 'The only tongue yet learnt in less than thirty-six\r\nlessons!'\r\n\r\nCaper, seated one night in the parquette of the Metastasio, had at his\r\nside a French infantry soldier. In conversation he asked him:\r\n\r\n'How long have you been in Rome?'\r\n\r\n'Three years, _Mossu_.'\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't you like to return to France?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?'\r\n\r\n'Wine is cheap, here, tobacco not dear, the ladies are extremely kind:\r\n_voila tout!_'\r\n\r\n'You have all these in France.'\r\n\r\n'_Oui, Mossu!_ but when I return there I shall be a farmer again; and\r\nit's a frightful fact that you may plow your heart out without turning\r\nup but a very small quantity of these articles there!'\r\n\r\nFrench soldiers still protect Rome--and 'these articles there.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEARDS OF ART.\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me,' said Uncle Bill Browne to Rocjean, with the air of a\r\nman about to ask a hard conundrum, 'why beards, long hair, and art,\r\nalways go together?'\r\n\r\n'Of course, art draws out beards along with talent; paints and bristles\r\nmust go together; but high-art drives the hair of the head in, and\r\nclinches it. Among artists first and last there have been men with giant\r\nminds, and they have known it was their duty to show their mental power:\r\nthe beard is the index.'\r\n\r\n'But the beard points downward,' suggested Caper, 'and not upward.'\r\n\r\n'That depends----'\r\n\r\n'On _pomade Hongroise_--or beeswax,' interrupted Caper.\r\n\r\n'Exactly; but let me answer Uncle Bill. To begin, we may safely assert\r\nthat an artist's life--here in Rome, for instance--is about as\r\nindependent a one as society will tolerate; its laws, as to shaving\r\nespecially, he ignores, and caring very little for the Rules of the\r\nToilette, as duly published by the--_bon ton_ journals, uses his razor\r\nfor mending lead-pencils, and permits his beard to enjoy long vacation\r\nrambles. Again: those who first set the example of long beards, Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, for example, who painted his own portrait with a full beard a\r\nfoot long, were men who moved from principle, and I have the belief that\r\nwere Leonardo alive to-day, he would say:\r\n\r\n\"My son, and well-beloved Rocjean, _zitto!_ and let ME talk. Know, then,\r\nthat I did permit my beard luxuriant length--for a reason. Thou dost not\r\nknow, but I do, that among the ancient Egyptians they worshiped in their\r\ndeity the male and female principle combined; so the exponents of this\r\nbelief, the Egyptian priests, endeavored in their attire to show a\r\nmingling of the male and female sex; they wore long garments like women,\r\n_vergogna!_ they wore long hair, _guai!_ and they SHAVED THEIR FACES! It\r\npains me to say, that their indecent example is followed even to this\r\nday, by the priests of what should be a purer and better religion.\r\n\r\n\"_Silenzio!_ I have not yet said my say. Among Eastern nations, their\r\nproverbs, and what is better, their customs, show a powerful protest\r\nagainst this impure old faith. You have seen the flowing beards of the\r\nMohammedans, especially the Turks, and their short-shaved heads of hair,\r\nand you may have heard of their words of wisdom:\r\n\r\n\"'Long hair, little brain.'\r\n\r\n\"And that eloquent sentence:\r\n\r\n\"'Who has no beard has no authority.'\r\n\r\n\"They have other sayings, which I can not approve of; for instance:\r\n\r\n\"'Do not buy a red-haired person, do not sell one, either; if you have\r\nany in the house, drive them away.'\r\n\r\n\"I say I do not approve of this, for the majority of the English have\r\nred heads, and people who want to buy my pictures I never would drive\r\nout of my house, _mai!_\"\r\n\r\n'Come,' said Caper, 'Leonardo no longer speaks when there is a question\r\nof buying or selling. Assume the first person.'\r\n\r\n'Another excellent reason for artists in Rome to wear beards is, that\r\nwhere their foreign names can not be pronounced, they are often called\r\nby the size, color, or shape, of this face-drapery. This is particularly\r\nthe case in the Café Greco, where the waiters, who have to charge for\r\ncoffee, etc., when the artist does not happen to have the change about\r\nhim, are compelled to give him a name on their books, and in more than\r\none instance, I know that they are called from their beards, I have a\r\nmemorandum of these nicknames: I am called _Barbone_, or Big-bearded;\r\nand you, Caper, are down as _Sbarbato Inglese_, the Shaved Englishman.'\r\n\r\n'Hm!' spoke Caper, 'I an't an Englishman, and I don't shave; my beard\r\nhas to come yet.'\r\n\r\n'What is my name?' asked Uncle Bill.\r\n\r\n'_Puga Sempre_, or He Pays Always. A countryman of mine is called _Baffi\r\nRici_, or Big Moustache; another one, _Barbetta_, Little Beard; another,\r\n_Barbáccia_, Shabby Beard; another, _Barba Nera_, Black Beard; and, of\r\ncourse, there is a _Barba Rossa_, or Red Beard. Some of the other names\r\nare funny enough, and would by no means please their owners. There is\r\n_Zoppo Francese_, the Lame Frenchman; _Scapiglione_, the Rowdy;\r\n_Pappagallo_, the Parrot; _Milordo_; _Furioso_; and one friend of ours\r\nis known, whenever he forgets to pay two baiocchi for his coffee, as\r\n_San Pietro_!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Uncle Bill, 'I'll tell you why I thought you artists wore\r\nlong beards: that when you were hard up, and couldn't buy brushes, you\r\nmight have the material ready to make your own.'\r\n\r\n'You're wrong, Uncle,' remarked Caper; 'when we can't buy them, we get\r\ntrusted for them--that's our way of having a brush with the enemy.'\r\n\r\n'That will do, Jim, that will do; say no more. None of the artists'\r\nbeards here, can compare with one belonging to a buffalo-and-prairie\r\npainter who lives out in St. Louis--it is so long he ties the ends\r\ntogether and uses it for a boot-jack. Good-night, boys, good-night!'\r\n\r\n\r\nA CALICO-PAINTER.\r\n\r\nRocjean was finishing his after-dinnerical coffee and cigar, when\r\nlooking up from _Las Novedades_, containing the latest news from Madrid,\r\nand in which he had just read _en Roma es donde hay mas mendigos_, Rome,\r\nis where most beggars are found; London, where most engineers, lost\r\nwomen, and rat-terriers, abound; Brussels, where women who smoke, are\r\nall round--looking up from this interesting reading, he saw opposite him\r\na young man, whose acquaintance he knew at a glance, was worth making.\r\nRefinement, common-sense, and energy were to be read plainly in his\r\nface. When he left the café, Rocjean asked an artist, with long hair,\r\nwho was fast smoking himself to the color of the descendants of Ham, if\r\nhe knew the man?'\r\n\r\n'No-o-oo, I believe he's some kind of a calico-painter.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! a feller that makes designs for a calico-mill.'\r\n\r\nNot long afterward Rocjean was introduced to him, and found him, as\r\nfirst impressions taught him he would--a man well worth knowing. Ho was\r\nmaking a holiday-visit to Rome, his settled residence being in Paris,\r\nwhere his occupation was designer of patterns for a large calico-mill in\r\nthe United States. A New-Yorker by birth, consequently more of a\r\ncosmopolitan than the provincial life of our other American cities will\r\ntolerate or can create in their children, Charles Gordon was every inch\r\na man, and a bitter foe to every liar and thief. He was well informed,\r\nfor he had, as a boy, been solidly instructed; he was polite, refined,\r\nfor he had been well educated. His life was a story often told:\r\nmercantile parent, very wealthy; son sent to college; talent for art,\r\ndeveloped at the expense of trigonometry and morning-prayers; mercantile\r\nparent fails, and falls from Fifth avenue to Brooklyn, preparatory to\r\nembarking for the land of those who have failed and fallen--wherever\r\nthat is. Son wears long hair, and believes he looks like the painter who\r\nwas killed by a baker's daughter, writes trashy verses about a man who\r\nwas wronged, and went off and howled himself to a long repose, sick of\r\nthis vale of tears, et cetera. Finally, in the midst of his despair,\r\nlong hair, bad poetry and painting, an enterprising friend, who sees he\r\nhas an eye for color, its harmonies and contrasts, raises him with a\r\nstrong hand into the clear atmosphere of exertion for a useful and\r\ndefinite end--makes him a 'calico-painter.'\r\n\r\nIt was a great scandal for the Bohemians of art to find this\r\ncalico-painter received every where in refined and intelligent society,\r\nwhile they, with all their airs, long hairs, and shares of impudence,\r\ncould not enter--they, the creators of Medoras, Magdalens, Our Ladies of\r\nLorette, Brigands' Brides, Madame not In, Captive Knights, Mandoline\r\nPlayers, Grecian Mothers, Love in Repose, Love in Sadness, Moonlight on\r\nthe Waves, Last Tears, Resignation, Broken Lutes, Dutch Flutes, and\r\nother mock-sentimental-titled paintings.\r\n\r\n'God save me from being a gazelle!' said the monkey.\r\n\r\n'God save us from being utility calico-painters!' cried the high-minded,\r\ndirty cavaliers who were not cavaliers, as they once more rolled over in\r\ntheir smoke-house.\r\n\r\n'In 1854,' said Gordon, one day, to Rocjean, after their acquaintance\r\nhad ripened into friendship, 'I was indeed in sad circumstances, and was\r\npassing through a phase of life when bad tobacco, acting on an empty\r\nstomach, gave me a glimpse of the Land of the Grumblers. One long year,\r\nand all that was changed; then I woke up to reality and practical life\r\nin a 'Calico-Mill;' then I wrote the lines you have asked me about. Take\r\nthem for what they are worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nREDIVIVUS.\r\n\r\nMDCCCLVI\r\n\r\n  'He sat in a garret in Fifty-four,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-five.\r\n  'God knows,' said he, 'if another year\r\n    Will find this man alive.\r\n  I was born for love, I live in song,\r\n  Yet loveless and songless I'm passing along,\r\n      And the world?--Hurrah!\r\n      Great soul, sing on!\r\n\r\n  'He sat in the dark, in Fifty-four,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-five.\r\n  'God knows,' said he, 'if another year\r\n    I'll any better thrive.\r\n  I was born for light, I live in the sun,\r\n  Yet in, darkness, and sunless, I'm passing on,\r\n      And the world?--Hurrah!\r\n      Great soul, shine on!'\r\n\r\n  'He sat in the cold, in Fifty-four,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-five.\r\n  'God knows,' said he, 'I'm fond of fire,\r\n    From warmth great joy derive.\r\n  I was born warm-hearted, and oh! it's wrong\r\n  For them all to coldly pass along:\r\n      And the world?--Hurrah!\r\n      Great soul, burn on!'\r\n\r\n  'He sat in a home, in Fifty-five,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-six.\r\n  'Throw open the doors!' he cried aloud,\r\n    'To all whom Fortune kicks!\r\n  I was born for love, I was born for song,\r\n  And great-hearted MEN my halls shall throng.\r\n      And the world?--Hurrah!\r\n      Great soul, sing on!'\r\n\r\n  'He sat in bright light, in Fifty-five,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-six.\r\n  'More lights!' he cried out with joyous shout,\r\n    'Night ne'er with day should mix.\r\n  I was born for light, I live in the sun,\r\n  In the joy of others my life's begun.\r\n      And the world?--Hurrah!\r\n      Great soul, shine on!'\r\n\r\n  'He sat in great warmth, in Fifty-five,\r\n    To welcome Fifty-six,\r\n  In a glad and merry company\r\n    Of brave, true-hearted Bricks!\r\n  'I was born for warmth, I was born for love,\r\n  I've found them all, thank GOD above!\r\n      And the world?--Ah! bah!\r\n      Great soul, move on!''\r\n\r\n\r\nA PATRON OF ART.\r\n\r\nThe Roman season was nearly over: travelers were making preparations to\r\nfly out of one gate as the Malaria should enter by the other; for,\r\naccording to popular report, this fearful disease enters, the last day\r\nof April, at midnight, and is in full possession of the city on the\r\nfirst day of May. Rocjean, not having any fears of it, was preparing not\r\nonly to meet it, but to go out and spend the summer with it; it costs\r\nsomething, however, to keep company with La Malaria, and our artist had\r\nbut little money: he must sell some paintings. Now it was unfortunate\r\nfor him that though a good painter, he was a bad salesman; he never kept\r\na list of all the arrivals of his wealthy countrymen or other strangers\r\nwho bought paintings; he never ran after them, laid them under\r\nobligations with drinks, dinners, and drives; for he had neither the\r\ninclination nor that capital which is so important for a\r\npicture-merchant to possess in order to drive--a heavy trade, and\r\nachieve success--such as it is. Rocjean had friends, and warm ones; so\r\nthat whenever they judged his finances were in an embarrassed state,\r\nthey voluntarily sent wealthy sensible as well as wealthy insensible\r\npatrons of art to his aid, the latter going as Dutch galliots laden with\r\ndoubloons might go to the relief of a poor, graceful felucca, thrown on\r\nher beam-ends by a squall.\r\n\r\nOne morning there glowed in Rocjean's studio the portly forms of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Cyrus Shodd, together with the tall, fragile figure of Miss Tillie\r\nShodd, daughter and heiress apparent and transparent. Rocjean welcomed\r\nthem as he would have manna in the desert, for he judged by the air and\r\nmanner of the head of the family, that he was on picture-buying bent. He\r\neven gayly smiled when Miss Shodd, pointing out to her father, with her\r\nparasol, some beauty in a painting on the easel, run its point along the\r\ncanvas, causing a green streak from the top of a stone pine to extend\r\nfrom the tree same miles into the distant mountains of the Abruzzi-the\r\npaint was not dry!\r\n\r\nShe made several hysterical shouts of horror after committing this\r\nlittle act, and then seating herself in an arm-chair, proceeded to take\r\na mental inventory of the articles of furniture in the studio.\r\n\r\nMr. Shodd explained to Rocjean that he was a plain man:\r\n\r\nThis was apparent at sight.\r\n\r\nThat he was an uneducated man:\r\n\r\nThis asserted itself to the eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nAfter which self-denial, he commenced 'pumping' the artist on various\r\nsubjects, assuming an ignorance of things which, to a casual observer,\r\nmade him appear like a fool; to a thoughtful person, a knave: the whole\r\ndone in order, perhaps, to learn about some trifle which a plain,\r\nstraightforward question would have elicited at once. Rocjean saw his\r\nman, and led him a fearful gallop in order to thoroughly examine his\r\naction and style.\r\n\r\nSpite of his commercial life, Mr. Shodd had found time to 'self-educate'\r\nhimself--he meant self-instruct--and having a retentive memory, and a\r\nnot always strict regard for truth, was looked up to by the\r\nhumble-ignorant as a very columbiad in argument, the only fault to be\r\nfound with which gun was, that when it was drawn from its quiescent\r\nstate into action, its effective force was comparatively nothing, one\r\nhalf the charge escaping through the large touch-hole of untruth.\r\nDiscipline was entirely wanting in Mr. Shodd's composition. A man who\r\nundertakes to be his own teacher rarely punishes his scholar, rarely\r\nchecks him with rules and practice, or accustoms him to order and\r\nsubordination. Mr. Shodd, therefore, was--undisciplined: a raw recruit,\r\nnot a soldier.\r\n\r\nOf course, his conversation was all contradictory. In one breath, on the\r\nself-abnegation principle, he would say, 'I don't know any thing about\r\npaintings;' in the next breath, his overweening egotism would make him\r\nloudly proclaim: 'There never was but one painter in this world, and\r\nhis name is Hockskins; he lives in my town, and he knows more than any\r\nof your 'old masters'! _I_ ought to know!' Or, '_I_ am an uneducated\r\nman,' meaning uninstructed; immediately following it with the assertion:\r\n'All teachers, scholars, and colleges are useless folly, and all\r\neducation is worthless, except self-education.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, self-education is too often only education of self!\r\n\r\nAfter carefully examining all Rocjean's pictures, he settled his\r\nattention on a sunset view over the Campagna, leaving Mrs. Shodd to talk\r\nwith our artist. You have seen--all have seen--more than one Mrs. Shodd;\r\nby nature and innate refinement, ladies; (the 'Little Dorrits' Dickens\r\nshows to his beloved countrymen, to prove to them that not all nobility\r\nis nobly born--a very mild lesson, which they refuse to regard;) Mrs.\r\nShodds who, married to Mr. Shodds, pass a life of silent protest against\r\nbrutal words and boorish actions. With but few opportunities to add\r\nacquirable graces to natural ease and self-possession, there was that in\r\nher kindly tone of voice and gentle manner winning the heart of a\r\ngentleman to respect her as he would his mother. It was her mission to\r\natone for her husband's sins, and she fulfilled her duty; more could not\r\nbe asked of her, for his sins were many. The daughter was a copy of the\r\nfather, in crinoline; taking to affectation--which is vulgarity in its\r\nmost offensive form--as a duck takes to water. Even her dress was\r\nmarked, not by that neatness which shows refinement, but by precision,\r\nwhich in dress is vulgar. One glance, and you saw the woman who in\r\nanother age would have thrown her glove to the tiger for her lover to\r\npick up!\r\n\r\nAmong Rocjean's paintings was the portrait of a very beautiful woman,\r\nmade by him years before, when he first became an artist, and long\r\nbefore he had been induced to abandon portrait-painting for landscape.\r\nIt was never shown to studio-visitors, and was placed with its face\r\nagainst the wall, behind other paintings. In moving one of these to\r\nplace it in a good light on the easel, it fell with the others to the\r\nfloor, face uppermost; and while Rocjean, with a painting in his hands,\r\ncould not stoop at once to replace it, Miss Shodd's sharp eyes\r\ndiscovered the beautiful face, and, her curiosity being excited, nothing\r\nwould do but it must be placed on the easel. Unwilling to refuse a\r\nrequest from the daughter of a Patron of Art in perspective, Rocjean\r\ncomplied, and, when the portrait was placed, glancing toward Mrs. Shodd,\r\nhad the satisfaction of reading in her eyes true admiration for the\r\nstartlingly lovely face looking out so womanly from the canvas.\r\n\r\n'Hm!' said Shodd the father, 'quite a fancy head.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! it is an exact portrait of Julia Ting; if she had sat for her\r\nlikeness, it couldn't have been better. I must have the painting, pa,\r\nfor Julia's sake. I _must_. It's a naughty word, isn't it, Mr. Rocjean?\r\nbut it is so expressive!'\r\n\r\n'Unfortunately, the portrait is not for sale; I placed it on the easel\r\nonly in order not to refuse your request.'\r\n\r\nMr. Shodd saw the road open to an argument. He was in ecstasy; a long\r\nargument--an argument full of churlish flings and boorish slurs, which\r\nhe fondly believed passed for polished satire and keen irony. He did not\r\nknow Rocjean; he never could know a man like him; he never could learn\r\nthe truth that confidence will overpower strength; only at last, when\r\nthrough his hide and bristles entered the flashing steel, did he,\r\ntottering backwards, open his eyes to the fact that he had found his\r\nmaster--that, too, in a poor devil of an artist.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes were all thrown aside; Shodd must have that portrait. His\r\ndaughter had set her heart on having it, he said, and could a gentleman\r\nrefuse a lady any thing?\r\n\r\n'It is on this very account I refuse to part with it,' answered Rocjean.\r\n\r\nIt instantly penetrated Shodd's head that all this refusal was only\r\ndesign on the part of the artist, to obtain a higher price for the work\r\nthan he could otherwise hope for; and so, with what he believed was a\r\nmaster-stroke of policy, he at once ceased importuning the artist, and\r\nshortly departed from the studio, preceding his wife with his daughter\r\non his arm, leaving the consoler, and by all means his best half, to\r\natone, by a few kind words at parting with the artist, for her husband's\r\nsins.\r\n\r\n'And there,' thought Rocjean, as the door closed, 'goes 'a patron of\r\nart'--and by no means the worst pattern. I hope he will meet with\r\nChapin, and buy an Orphan and an Enterprise statue; once in his house,\r\nthey will prove to every observant man the owner's taste.'\r\n\r\nMr. Shodd, having a point to gain, went about it with elephantine grace\r\nand dexterity. The portrait he had seen at Rocjean's studio he was\r\ndetermined to have. He invited the artist to dine with him--the artist\r\nsent his regrets; to accompany him, 'with the ladies,' in his carriage\r\nto Tivoli--the artist politely declined the invitation; to a\r\n_conversazione_, the invitation from Mrs. Shodd--a previous engagement\r\nprevented the artist's acceptance.\r\n\r\nMr. Shodd changed his tactics. He discovered at his banker's one day a\r\nkeen, communicative, wiry, shrewd, etc., etc., enterprising, etc., 'made\r\na hundred thousand dollars' sort of a little man, named Briggs, who was\r\ntraveling in order to travel, and grumble. Mr. Shodd 'came the ignorant\r\ngame' over this Briggs; pumped him, without obtaining any information,\r\nand finally turned the conversation on artists, denouncing the entire\r\nbody as a set of the keenest swindlers, and citing the instance of one\r\nhe knew who had a painting which he believed it would be impossible for\r\nany man to buy, simply because the artist, knowing that he (Shodd)\r\nwished it, would not set a price on it, so as to have a very high one\r\noffered (!) Mr. Briggs instantly was deeply interested. Here was a\r\nchance for him to display before Shodd of Shoddsville his shrewdness,\r\nkeenness, and so forth. He volunteered to buy the painting.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, an artist's studio may be his castle, or it may be an Exchange.\r\nTo have it the first, you must affix a notice to your studio-door\r\nannouncing that all entrance of visitors to the studio is forbidden\r\nexcept on, say, 'Monday from twelve A.M. to three P.M. This is the\r\nbaronial manner. But the artist who is not wealthy or has not made a\r\nname, must keep an Exchange, and receive all visitors who choose to\r\ncome, at almost any hours--model hours excepted. So Briggs, learning\r\nfrom Shodd, by careful cross-questioning, the artist's name, address,\r\nand a description of the painting, walked there at once, introduced\r\nhimself to Rocjean, shook his hand as if it were the handle of a pump\r\nupon which he had serious intentions, and then began examining the\r\npaintings. He looked at them all, but there was no portrait. He asked\r\nRocjean if he painted portraits; he found out that he did not. Finally,\r\nhe told the artist that he had heard some one say--he did not remember\r\nwho--that he had seen a very pretty head in his studio, and asked\r\nRocjean if he would show it to him.\r\n\r\n'You have seen Mr. Shodd lately, I should think?' said the artist,\r\nlooking into the eyes of Mr. Briggs.\r\n\r\nA suggestion of a clean brick-bat passed under a sheet of yellow\r\ntissue-paper was observable in the hard cheeks of Mr. Briggs, that being\r\nthe final remnant of all appearance of modesty left in the sharp man, in\r\nthe shape of a blush.\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes; every body knows Shodd--man of great talent--generous,' said\r\nBriggs.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Shodd may be very well known,' remarked Rocjean measuredly, 'but\r\nthe portrait he saw is not well known; he and his family are the only\r\nones who have seen it. Perhaps it may save you trouble to know that the\r\nportrait I have several times refused to sell him will never be sold\r\nwhile I live. The _common_ opinion that an artist, like a Jew, will sell\r\nthe old clo' from his back for money, is erroneous.'\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs shortly after this left the studio, slightly at a discount,\r\nand as if he had been measured, as he said to himself; and then and\r\nthere determined to say nothing to Shodd about his failing in his\r\nmission to the savage artist. But Shodd found it all out in the first\r\nconversation he made with Briggs; and very bitter were his feelings when\r\nhe learnt that a poor devil of an artist dared possess any thing he\r\ncould not buy, and moreover had a quiet moral strength which the vulgar\r\nman feared. In his anger, Shodd, with his disregard for truth, commenced\r\na fearful series of attacks against the artist, regaling every one he\r\ndared to with the coarsest slanders, in the vilest language, against the\r\npainter's character. A very few days sufficed to circulate them, so that\r\nthey reached Rocjean's ears; a very few minutes passed before the artist\r\npresented himself to the eyes of Shodd, and, fortunately finding him\r\nalone, told him in four words, 'You are a slanderer;' mentioning to him,\r\nbeside, that if he ever uttered another slander against his name, he\r\nshould compel him to give him instantaneous satisfaction, and that, as\r\nan American, Shodd knew what that meant.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that a liar and slanderer is a coward;\r\nconsequently Mr. Shodd, with the consequences before his eyes, never\r\nagain alluded to Rocjean, and shortly left the city for Naples, to\r\nbestow the light of his countenance there in his great character of Art\r\nPatron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'It is a heart-touching face,' said Caper, as one morning, while hauling\r\nover his paintings, Rocjean brought the portrait to light which the\r\ncunning Shodd had so longed to possess for cupidity's sake.\r\n\r\n'I should feel as if I had thrown Psyche to the Gnomes to be torn to\r\npieces, if I had given such a face to Shodd. If I had sold it to him, I\r\nshould have been degraded; for the women loved by man should be kept\r\nsacred in memory. She was a girl I knew in Prague, and, I think, with\r\nsix or eight exceptions, the loveliest one I ever met. Some night, at\r\nsunset, I shall walk over the old bridge, and meet her as we parted;\r\n_apropos_ of which meeting, I once wrote some words. Hand me that\r\nportfolio, will you? Thank you. Oh! yes; here they are. Now, read them,\r\nCaper; out with them!\r\n\r\n\r\nANEZKA OD PRAHA.\r\n\r\n  Years, weary years, since on the Moldau bridge,\r\n  By the five stars and cross of Nepomuk,\r\n  I kissed the scarlet sunset from her lips:\r\n    Anezka, fair Bohemian, thou wert there!\r\n\r\n  Dark waves beneath the bridge were running fast,\r\n  In haste to bathe the shining rocks, whence rose\r\n  Tier over tier, the gloaming domes and spires,\r\n  Turrets and minarets of the Holy City,\r\n  Its crown the Hradschin of Bohemia's kings.\r\n  O'er Wysscherad we saw the great stars shine;\r\n  We felt the night-wind on the rushing stream;\r\n  We drank the air as if 'twere Melnick wine,\r\n  And every draught whirled us still nearer Nebe:\r\n    Anezka, fair Bohemian, thou wert there!\r\n\r\n  Why ever gleam thy black eyes sadly on me?\r\n  Why ever rings thy sweet voice in my ear?\r\n  Why looks thy pale face from the drifting foam--\r\n  Dashed by the wild sea on this distant shore--\r\n  Or from the white clouds does it beckon me?\r\n\r\n  My own heart answers: On the Moldau bridge,\r\n    Anezka, we will meet to part no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY TROLLOPE ON AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony Trollope's work entitled _North-America_ has been\r\nrepublished in this country, and curiosity has at length been satisfied.\r\nGreat as has been this curiosity among his friends, it can not, however,\r\nbe said to have been wide-spread, inasmuch as up to the appearance of\r\nthis book of travels, comparatively few were aware of the presence of\r\nMr. Trollope in this country. When Charles Dickens visited America, our\r\npeople testified their admiration of his homely genius by going mad,\r\nreceiving him with frantic acclamations of delight, dining him, and\r\nsuppering him, and going through the 'pump-handle movement' with him.\r\nMr. Dickens was, in consequence, intensely bored by this attestation of\r\npopular idolatry so peculiar to the United States, and looked upon us as\r\nofficious, absurd, and disgusting. Officious we were, and absurd enough,\r\nsurely, but far from being disgusting. He ought hardly to beget disgust\r\nwhose youth and inexperience leads him to extravagance in his kindly\r\ndemonstrations toward genius. However, Mr. Dickens went home rather more\r\nimpressed by our faults, which he had had every opportunity of\r\ninspecting, than by our virtues, which possessed fewer salient features\r\nto his humorous eye. Two books--_American Notes_ and _Martin\r\nChuzzlewit_--were the product of his tour through America. Thereupon,\r\nthe American people grew very indignant. Their Dickens-love, in\r\nproportion to its intensity, turned to Dickens-hate, and ingratitude was\r\nconsidered to be synonymous with the name of this novelist. We gave him\r\nevery chance to see our follies, and we snubbed his cherished and chief\r\nobject in visiting America, concerning a copyright. There is little\r\nwonder, then, that Dickens, an Englishman and a caricaturist, should\r\nhave painted us in the colors that he did. There is scarcely less wonder\r\nthat Americans, at that time, all in the white-heat of enthusiasm,\r\nshould have waxed angry at Dickens' cold return to so much warmth. But,\r\nreading these books in the light of 1862, there are few of us who do not\r\nsmile at the rage of our elders. We see an uproariously funny\r\nextravaganza in _Martin Chuzzlewit_, which we can well afford to laugh\r\nat, having grown thicker-skinned, and wonder what there is to be found\r\nin the _Notes_ so very abominable to an American. Mr. Dickens was a\r\nhumorist, not a statesman or philosopher, therefore he wrote of us as a\r\ndisappointed humorist would have been tempted to write.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that Mr. Trollope's advent in this country would have\r\ngiven rise to any remark or excitement, his novels, clever though they\r\nbe, not having taken hold of the people's heart as did those of Dickens.\r\nHe came among us quietly; the newspapers gave him no flourish of\r\ntrumpets; he traveled about unknown; hence it was, that few knew a new\r\nbook was to be written upon America by one bearing a name not\r\nover-popular thirty years ago. Curiosity was confined to the friends and\r\nacquaintances of Mr. Trollope, who were naturally not a little anxious\r\nthat he should conscientiously write such a book as would remove the\r\nexisting prejudice to the name of Trollope, and render him personally as\r\npopular as his novels. For there are, we believe, few intelligent\r\nAmericans (and Mr. Trollope is good enough to say that we of the North\r\nare all intelligent) who are not ready to '_faire l'aimable_' to the\r\nkindly, genial author of _North-America_. It is not being rash to state\r\nthat Mr. Trollope, in his last book, has not disappointed his warmest\r\npersonal friends in this country, and this is saying much, when it is\r\nconsidered that many of them are radically opposed to him in many of\r\nhis opinions, and most of them hold very different views from him in\r\nregard to the present war. They are not disappointed, because Mr.\r\nTrollope has _labored_ to be impartial in his criticisms. He has, at\r\nleast, _endeavored_ to lay aside his English prejudices and judge us in\r\na spirit of truth and good-fellowship. Mr. Trollope inaugurated a new\r\nera in British book-making upon America, when he wrote: 'If I could in\r\nany small degree add to the good feeling which should exist between two\r\nnations which ought to love each other so well, and which do hang upon\r\neach other so constantly, I should think that I had cause to be proud of\r\nmy work.' In saying this much, Mr. Trollope has said what others of his\r\nilk--Bulwer, Thackeray, and Dickens--would _not_ have said, and he may\r\nwell be proud, or, at least, he can afford _not_ to be proud, of a\r\nsuperior honesty and frankness. He has won for himself kind thoughts on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic, and were Americans convinced that the body\r\nEnglish were imbued with the spirit of Mr. Trollope, there would be\r\nlittle left of the resuscitated 'soreness.'\r\n\r\nIn his introduction, Mr. Trollope frankly acknowledges that 'it is very\r\nhard to write about any country a book that does not represent the\r\ncountry described in a more or less ridiculous point of view.' He\r\nconfesses that he is not a philosophico-political or\r\npolitico-statistical or a statistico-scientific writer, and hence,\r\n'ridicule and censure run glibly from the pen, and form themselves into\r\nsharp paragraphs, which are pleasant to the reader. Whereas, eulogy is\r\ncommonly dull, and too frequently sounds as though it were false.' We\r\nagree with him, that 'there is much difficulty in expressing a verdict\r\nwhich is intended to be favorable, but which, though favorable, shall\r\nnot be falsely eulogistic, and though true, not offensive.' Mr. Trollope\r\nhas not been offensive either in his praise or dispraise; and when we\r\nlook upon him in the light in which he paints himself--that of an\r\nEnglish novelist--he has, at least, done his best by us. We could not\r\nexpect from him such a book as Emerson wrote on _English Traits_, or\r\nsuch an one as Thomas Buckle would have written had death not staid his\r\ngreat work of _Civilization_. Nor could we look to him for that which\r\nJohn Stuart Mill--the English De Tocqueville--alone can give. For much\r\nthat we expected we have received, for that which is wanting we shall\r\nnow find fault, but good-naturedly, we hope.\r\n\r\nOur first ground of complaint against Mr. Trollope's _North-America_, is\r\nits extreme verbosity. Had it been condensed to one half, or at least\r\none third of its present size, the spirit of the book had been less\r\nweakened, and the taste of the public better satisfied. The question\r\nnaturally arises in an inquiring mind, if the author could make so much\r\nout of a six months' tour through the Northern States, what would the\r\nconsequences have been had he remained a year, and visited Dixie's land\r\nas well? The conclusions logically arrived at are, to say the least,\r\nvery unfavorable to weak-eyed persons who are condemned to read the\r\ncheap American edition. Life is too short, and books are too numerous,\r\nto allow of repetition; and at no time is Mr. Trollope so guilty in this\r\nrespect as when he dilates upon those worthies, Mason and Slidell, in\r\nconnection with the Trent affair. It was very natural, especially as\r\nEngland has come off first-best in this matter, that Mr. Trollope should\r\nhave made a feature of the Trent in reporting the state of the American\r\npulse thereon. One reference to the controversy was desirable, two\r\nendurable, but the third return to the charge is likely to meet with\r\nimpatient exclamations from the reader, who heartily sympathizes with\r\nthe author when he says: 'And now, I trust, I may finish my book without\r\nagain naming Messrs. Slidell and Mason.'\r\n\r\nIt certainly was rash to rave as we did on this subject, but it was\r\nquite natural, when our jurists, (even the Hon. Caleb Cushing) who were\r\nsupposed to know their business, assured us that we had right on our\r\nside. It was extremely ridiculous to put Captain Wilkes upon a pedestal\r\na little lower than Bunker-Hill monument, and present him with a hero's\r\nsword for doing what was then considered _only_ his duty. But it must be\r\nremembered that at that time the mere performance of duty by a public\r\nofficer was so extraordinary a phenomenon that loyal people were brought\r\nto believe it merited especial recognition. Our Government, and not the\r\npeople, were to blame. Had the speech of Charles Sumner, delivered on\r\nhis 'field-day,' been the verdict of the Washington Cabinet _previous_\r\nto the reception of England's expostulations, the position taken by\r\nAmerica on this subject would have been highly dignified and honorable.\r\nAs it is, we stand with feathers ruffled and torn. But if, as we\r\nsuppose, the Trent imbroglio leads to a purification of maritime law,\r\nnot only America, but the entire commercial world will be greatly\r\nindebted to the super-patriotism of Captain Wilkes.\r\n\r\n'The charming women of Boston' are inclined to quarrel with their friend\r\nMr. Trollope, for ridiculing their powers of argumentation _apropos_ to\r\nCaptain Wilkes, for Mr. Trollope must confess they knew quite as much\r\nabout what they were talking as the lawyers by whom they were\r\ninstructed. They have had more than their proper share of revenge,\r\nhowever, meted out for them by the reviewer of the London _Critic_, who\r\nwrites as follows:\r\n\r\n     'Mr. Trollope was in Boston when the first news about the Trent\r\n     arrived. Of course, every body was full of the subject at once--Mr.\r\n     Trollope, we presume, not excluded--albeit he is rather sarcastic\r\n     upon the young ladies who began immediately to chatter about it.\r\n     'Wheaton is quite clear about it,' said one young girl to me. It\r\n     was the first I had heard of Wheaton, and so far was obliged to\r\n     knock under.' Yet Mr. Trollope, knowing very little more of Wheaton\r\n     than he did before, and obviously nothing of the great authorities\r\n     on maritime law, inflicts upon his readers page after page of\r\n     argument upon the Trent affair, not half so delightful as the\r\n     pretty babble of the ball-room belle. With all due respect to Mr.\r\n     Trollope, and his attractions, we are quite sure that we would much\r\n     sooner get our international law from the lips of the fair\r\n     Bostonian than from _his_.'\r\n\r\nAfter such a champion as this, could the fair Bostonians have the heart\r\nto assail Mr. Trollope?\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope treats of our civil war at great length; in fact, the\r\nreverberations of himself on this matter are quite as objectionable as\r\nthose in the Trent affair. But it is his treatment of this subject that\r\nmust ever be a source of regret to the earnest thinkers who are\r\ngradually becoming the masters of our Government's policy, who\r\nconstitute the bone and muscle of the land, the rank and file of the\r\narmy, and who are changing the original character of the war into that\r\nof a holy crusade. It is to be deplored, because Mr. Trollope's book\r\nwill no doubt influence English opinion, to a certain extent, and\r\ntherefore militate against us, and we already know how his mistaken\r\nopinions have been seized upon by pro-slavery journals in this country\r\nas a _bonne bouche_ which they rarely obtain from so respectable a\r\nsource; the more palatable to them, coming from that nationality which\r\nwe have always been taught to believe was more abolition in its creed\r\nthan William Lloyd Garrison himself, and from whose people we have\r\nreceived most of our lectures on the sin of slavery. It is sad that so\r\nfine a nature as that of Mr. Trollope should not feel\r\nconscience-stricken in believing that 'to mix up the question of general\r\nabolition with this war must be the work of a man too ignorant to\r\nunderstand the real subject of the war, or too false to his country to\r\nregard it.' Yet it is strange that these 'too ignorant' or 'too false'\r\nmen are the very ones that Mr. Trollope holds up to admiration, and\r\ndeclares that any nation might be proud to claim their genius.\r\nLongfellow and Lowell, Emerson and Motley, to whom we could add almost\r\nall the well-known thinkers of the country, men after his own heart in\r\nmost things, belong to this 'ignorant' or 'false' sect. Is it their one\r\nmadness? That is a strange madness which besets our _greatest_ men and\r\nwomen; a marvelous anomaly surely. Yet there must be something\r\nsympathetic in abolitionism to Mr. Trollope, for he prefers Boston, the\r\ncentre of this ignorance, to all other American cities, and finds his\r\nfriends for the most part among these false ones, by which we are to\r\nconclude that Mr. Trollope is by nature an abolitionist, but that\r\ncircumstances have been unfavorable to his proper development. And these\r\ncircumstances we ascribe to a hasty and superficial visit to the British\r\nWest-India colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in his entertaining book on travels in the\r\nWest-Indies and Spanish Main, Mr. Trollope undertakes to prove that\r\nemancipation has both ruined the commercial prosperity of the British\r\nislands and degraded the free blacks to a level with the idle brute. Mr.\r\nTrollope is still firm in this opinion, notwithstanding the statistics\r\nof the Blue Book, which prove that these colonies never were in so\r\nflourishing a condition as at present. We, in America, have also had the\r\nsame fact demonstrated by figures, in that very plainly written book\r\ncalled the _Ordeal of Free Labor_. Mr. Trollope, no doubt, saw some very\r\nlazy negroes, wallowing in dirt, and living only for the day, but later\r\ndevelopments have proved that his investigations could have been simply\r\nthose of a dilettante. It is highly probable that the planters who have\r\nbeen shorn of their riches by the edict of Emancipation, should paint\r\nthe present condition of the blacks in any thing but rose-colors, and\r\nwe, of course, believe that Mr. Trollope _believes_ what he has written.\r\nHe is none the less mistaken, if we are to pin our faith to the Blue\r\nBook, which we are told never lies. And yet, believing that emancipation\r\nhas made a greater brute than ever of the negro, Mr. Trollope rejoices\r\nin the course which has been pursued by the home government. If both\r\nwhite man and black man are worse off than they were before, what good\r\ncould have been derived from the reform, and by what right ought he to\r\nrejoice? Mr. Trollope claims to be an anti-slavery man, but we must\r\nconfess that to our way of arguing, the ground he stands upon in this\r\nmatter is any thing but _terra firma_. Mr. Trollope was probably\r\nthinking of those dirty West-India negroes when he made the following\r\ncomments upon a lecture delivered by Wendell Phillips:\r\n\r\n     'I have sometimes thought that there is no being so venomous, so\r\n     bloodthirsty, as a professed philanthropist; and that when the\r\n     philanthropist's ardor lies negro-ward, it then assumes the deepest\r\n     die of venom and bloodthirstiness. There are four millions of\r\n     slaves in the Southern States, none of whom have any capacity for\r\n     self-maintenance or self-control. Four millions of slaves, with the\r\n     necessities of children, with the passions of men, and the\r\n     ignorance of savages! And Mr. Phillips would emancipate these at a\r\n     blow; would, were it possible for him to do so, set them loose upon\r\n     the soil to tear their masters, destroy each other, and make such a\r\n     hell upon earth as has never even yet come from the uncontrolled\r\n     passions and unsatisfied wants of men.'\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope should have thought twice before he wrote thus of the\r\nAmerican negro. Were he a competent authority on this subject, his\r\nopinion might be worth something; but as he never traveled in the South,\r\nand as his knowledge of the negro is limited to a surface acquaintance\r\nwith the West-Indies, we maintain that Mr. Trollope has not only been\r\nunjust, but ungenerous. Four millions of slaves, none of whom have any\r\ncapacity for self-maintenance or self-control! Whom are we to believe?\r\nMr. Trollope, who has never been on a Southern plantation, or Frederick\r\nLaw Olmsted? Mr. Pierce, who has been superintendent of the contrabands\r\nat Fortress Monroe and at Hilton Head, officers attached to Burnside's\r\nDivision, and last and best, General David Hunter, an officer of the\r\nregular army, who went to South-Carolina with anti-abolition\r\nantecedents? All honor to General Hunter, who, unlike many others, has\r\nnot shut his eyes upon facts, and, like a rational being, has yielded to\r\nthe logic of events. It is strange that these authorities, all of whom\r\npossess the confidence of the Government, should disagree with Mr.\r\nTrollope. _None_ self-maintaining? Robert Small is a pure negro. Is he\r\nnot more than self-maintaining? Has he not done more for the Federal\r\nGovernment than any white man of the Gulf States? Tillman is a negro;\r\nthe best pilots of the South are negroes: are _they_ not\r\nself-maintaining? Kansas has welcomed thousands of fugitive slaves to\r\nher hospitable doors, not as paupers, but as laborers, who have taken\r\nthe place of those white men who have gone to fight the battles which\r\nthey also should be allowed to take part in. The women have been gladly\r\naccepted as house-servants. Does not this look like self-maintenance?\r\nWould negroes be employed in the army if they were as Mr. Trollope\r\npictures them? He confesses that without these four millions of slaves\r\nthe South would be a wilderness, therefore they _do_ work as slaves to\r\nthe music of the slave-drivers' whip. How very odd, that the moment men\r\nand women (for Mr. Trollope does acknowledge them to be such) _own\r\nthemselves_, and are paid for the sweat of their brow, they should\r\nforget the trades by which they have enriched the South, and become\r\nincapable of maintaining themselves--they who have maintained three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand insolent slave-owners! Given whip-lashes and\r\nthe incubus of a white family, the slave _will_ work; given freedom and\r\nwages, the negro _won't_ work. Was there ever stated a more palpable\r\nfallacy? Is it necessary to declare further that the Hilton Head\r\nexperiment is a success, although the negroes, wanting in slave-drivers\r\nand in their musical instruments, began their planting very late in the\r\nseason? Is it necessary to give Mr. Trollope one of many figures, and\r\nprove that in the British West-India colonies free labor has exported\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-five millions pounds of sugar annually, whereas\r\nslave labor only exported one hundred and eighty-seven millions three\r\nhundred thousand? And this in a climate where, unlike even the Southern\r\nStates of North-America, there is every inducement to indolence.\r\n\r\nFour millions of slaves, _none_ of whom are capable of self-control, who\r\npossess the necessities of children, the passions of men, and the\r\nignorance of savages! We really have thought that the many thousands of\r\nthese four millions who have come under the Federal jurisdiction,\r\nexercised considerable self-control, when it is remembered that in some\r\nlocalities they have been left entire masters of themselves, have in\r\nother instances labored months for the Government under promise of pay,\r\nand have had that pay prove a delusion. Certainly it is fair to judge of\r\na whole by a part. Given a bone, Professor Agassiz can draw the animal\r\nof which the bone forms a part. Given many thousands of negroes, we\r\nshould be able to judge somewhat of four millions. Had Mr. Trollope seen\r\nthe thousands of octoroons and quadroons enslaved in the South by their\r\n_own fathers_, it would have been more just in him to have attributed a\r\nwant of _self-control_ to the _masters_ of these four millions. We do\r\nnot know what Mr. Trollope means by 'the necessities of children.\r\nChildren need to be sheltered, fed, and clothed, and so do the negroes,\r\nbut here the resemblance ends; for whereas children can not take care of\r\nthemselves, the negro _can_, provided there is any opportunity to work.\r\nIt is scarcely to be doubted that temporary distress must arise among\r\nfugitives in localities where labor is not plenty; but does this\r\nestablish the black man's incapacity? Revolutions, especially those\r\nwhich are internal, generally bring in their train distress to laborers.\r\nThen we are told that the slaves are endowed with the passions of men;\r\nand very glad are we to know this, for, as a love of liberty and a\r\nwillingness to sacrifice all things for freedom, is one of the loftiest\r\npassions in men, were he devoid of this passion, we should look with\r\nmuch less confidence to assistance from the negro in this war of freedom\r\n_versus_ slavery, than we do at present. In stating that the slaves are\r\nas ignorant as savages, Mr. Trollope pays an exceedingly poor compliment\r\nto the Southern whites, as it would naturally be supposed that constant\r\ncontact with a superior race would have civilized the negro to a\r\n_certain_ extent, especially as he is known to be wonderfully imitative.\r\nAnd such is the case; at least the writer of these lines, who has been\r\nborn and bred in a slave State, thinks so. As a whole, they compare very\r\nfavorably with the 'poor white trash,' and individually they are vastly\r\nsuperior to this 'trash.' It is true, that they can not read or write,\r\nnot from want of aptitude or desire, as the teachers among the\r\ncontrabands write that their desire to read amounts to a passion, in\r\nmany cases, even among the hoary-headed, but because the teaching of a\r\nslave to read or write was, in the good old times before the war,\r\nregarded and punished as a criminal offense. What a pity it is that we\r\ncan not go back to the Union _as it was!_ In this ignorance of the\r\nrudiments of learning, the negroes are not unlike a large percentage of\r\nthe populations of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n'And Mr. Phillips would let these ignorant savages loose upon the soil\r\nto tear their masters, destroy each other, and make such a hell upon\r\nearth as has never even yet come from the uncontrolled passions and\r\nunsatisfied wants of men!' If Mr. Trollope were read in the history of\r\nemancipation, he would know that there has not been an instance of 'such\r\na hell upon earth' as he describes. The American negro is a singularly\r\ndocile, affectionate, and good-natured creature, not at all given to\r\ndestroying his kind or tearing his master, and the least inclined to do\r\nthese things at a time when there is no necessity for them. A slave is\r\nlikely to kill his master to gain his freedom, but he is not fond enough\r\nof murder to kill him when no object is to be gained except a halter.\r\nThe record so far proves that the masters have shot down their slaves\r\nrather than have them fall into the hands of the Union troops. Even\r\ngranting Mr. Trollope's theory of the negro disposition, no edict of\r\nemancipation could produce such an effect as he predicts, to the\r\n_masters_, at least. They, in revenge, might shoot down their slaves,\r\nbut, unfortunately, the victims would be unable to defend themselves,\r\nfrom the fact that all arms are sedulously kept from them. The slaves\r\nwould run away in greater numbers than they do at present, would give us\r\nvaluable information of the enemy, and would swell our ranks as\r\nsoldiers, if permitted, and kill their rebel masters in the legal and\r\nhonorable way of war. It is likely that Mr. Trollope, holding the black\r\nman in so little estimation, would doubt his abilities in this capacity.\r\nFortunately for us, we can quote as evidence in our favor from General\r\nHunter's late letter to Congress, which, for sagacity and elegant\r\nsarcasm, is unrivaled among American state papers. General Hunter, after\r\nstating that the 'loyal slaves, unlike their fugitive masters, welcome\r\nhim, aid him, and supply him with food, labor, and information, working\r\nwith remarkable industry,' concludes by stating that 'the experiment of\r\narming the blacks, so far as I have made it, has been a complete and\r\neven marvelous success. They are sober, docile, attentive, and\r\nenthusiastic, _displaying great natural capacity for acquiring the\r\nduties of the soldier_. They are eager beyond all things to take the\r\nfield and be led into action, and it is the _unanimous opinion_ of the\r\nofficers who have had charge of them, that in the peculiarities of this\r\nclimate and country, they will prove invaluable auxiliaries, fully equal\r\nto the similar regiments so long and successfully used by the British\r\nauthorities in the West-India Islands. In conclusion, I would say that\r\nit is my hope, there appearing no possibility of other reinforcements,\r\nowing to the exigencies of the campaign on the peninsula, to have\r\norganized by the end of next fall, and to be able to present to the\r\nGovernment, from forty-eight to fifty thousand of these hardy and\r\ndevoted soldiers.'\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope declares that without the slaves the South would be a\r\nwilderness; he also says that the North is justified in the present war\r\nagainst the South, and although he doubts our ability to attain our ends\r\nin this war, he would be very glad if we were victorious. If these are\r\nhis opinions, and if further, he considers slavery to be the cause of\r\nthe war, then why in the name of common-sense does he not advocate that\r\nwhich would bring about our lasting success? He expresses his\r\nsatisfaction at the probability of emancipation in Missouri, Kentucky,\r\nand Virginia, and yet rather than that abolition should triumph\r\nuniversally, he would have the Gulf States go off by themselves and sink\r\ninto worse than South-American insignificance, a curse to themselves\r\nfrom the very reason of slavery. This, to our way of thinking, is vastly\r\nmore cruel to the South than even the 'hell upon earth,' which,\r\nsupposing it were possible, emancipation would create. A massacre could\r\naffect but one generation: such a state of things as Mr. Trollope\r\nexpects to see would poison numberless generations. The Northern brain\r\nis gradually ridding itself of mental fog, begotten by Southern\r\ninfluences, and Mr. Trollope will not live to see the Gulf States sink\r\ninto a moral Dismal Swamp. The day is not far distant when a God-fearing\r\nand justice-loving people will give these States their choice between\r\nEmancipation and death in their 'last ditch,' which we suppose to be the\r\nGulf of Mexico. Repulses before Richmond only hasten this end. 'But\r\nCongress can not do this,' says Mr. Trollope. Has martial law no virtue?\r\nWe object to the title, 'An Apology for the War,' which Mr. Trollope has\r\ngiven to one of his chapters; and with the best of motives, he takes\r\ngreat pains to prove to the English public how we of the North could not\r\nbut fight the South, however losing a game it might be. No true American\r\nneed beg pardon of Europe for this war, which is the only apology we can\r\nmake to civilization for slavery. Mr. Trollope states the worn-out cant\r\nthat the secessionists of the South have been aided and abetted by the\r\nfanatical abolitionism of the North. Of course they have: had there been\r\nno slavery, there would have been no abolitionists, and therefore no\r\nsecessionists. Wherever there is a wrong, there are always persons\r\nfanatical enough to cry out against that wrong. In time, the few\r\nfanatics become the majority, and conquer the wrong, to the infinite\r\ndisgust of the easy-going present, but to the gratitude of a better\r\nfuture. The Abolitionists gave birth to the Republican party, and of\r\ncourse the triumph of the Republican party was the father to secession;\r\nbut we see no reason to mourn that it was so; rather do we thank God\r\nthat the struggle has come in our day. We can not sympathize with Mr.\r\nTrollope when he says of the Bell and Everett party: 'Their express\r\ntheory was this: that the question of slavery should not be touched.\r\nTheir purpose was to crush agitation, and restore harmony by an\r\nimpartial balance between the North and South: a fine purpose--the\r\nfinest of all purposes, had it been practicable.' We suppose by this,\r\nthat Mr. Trollope wishes such a state of things had been practicable.\r\nThe impartial balance means the Crittenden Compromise, whose\r\nimpartiality the North fails to see in any other light than a fond\r\nleaning to the South, giving it all territory South of a certain\r\nlatitude, a _latitude_ that never was intended by the Constitution. It\r\nseems to us that there can be no impartial balance between freedom and\r\nslavery. Every jury must be partial to the right, or they sin before\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope tells us that 'the South is seceding from the North because\r\nthe two are not homogeneous. They have different instincts, different\r\nappetites, different morals, and a different culture. It is well for one\r\nman to say that slavery has caused the separation, and for another to\r\nsay that slavery has not caused it. Each in so saying speaks the truth.\r\nSlavery has caused it, seeing that slavery is the great point on which\r\nthe two have agreed to differ. But slavery has not caused it, seeing\r\nthat other points of difference are to be found In every circumstance\r\nand feature of the two people. The North and the South must ever be\r\ndissimilar. In the North, labor will always be honorable, and because\r\nhonorable, successful. In the South, labor has ever been servile--at\r\nleast in some sense--and therefore dishonorable; and because\r\ndishonorable, has not, to itself, been successful.' Is not this arguing\r\nin a circle? The North is dissimilar to the South. Why? Because labor is\r\nhonorable in the former, and dishonorable, because of its servility, in\r\nthe latter. The servility removed, in what are the two dissimilar? One\r\nthird of the Southern whites are related by marriage to the North; a\r\nsecond third are Northerners, and it is this last third that are most\r\nviolent in their acts against and hatred of the North. They were born\r\nwith our instincts and appetites, educated in the same morals, and\r\nreceived the same culture; and these men are no worse than some of their\r\nbrothers who, though they have not emigrated to the South, have yet\r\nfattened upon cotton. The parents of Jefferson Davis belonged to\r\nConnecticut; Slidell is a New-Yorker; Benjamin is a Northerner; General\r\nLovell is a disgrace to Massachusetts; so, too, is Albert Pike. It is\r\nutter nonsense to say that we are two people. Two interests have been at\r\nwork--free labor and slave labor; and when the former triumphs, there\r\nwill be no more straws split about two people, nor will the refrain of\r\nagriculture _versus_ manufacture be sung. The South, especially\r\nVirginia, has untold wealth to be drained from her great water-power.\r\nNew-England will not be alone in manufacturing, nor Pennsylvania in\r\nmining.\r\n\r\nWe think that Mr. Trollope fails to appreciate principle when he likens\r\nthe conflict between the two sections of our country to a quarrel\r\nbetween Mr. and Mrs. Jones, in which a mutual friend (England) is, from\r\nthe very nature of the case, obliged to maintain neutrality, leaving the\r\nmatter to the tender care of Sir Creswell. There never yet existed a\r\nmutual friend who, however little he interfered with a matrimonial\r\ndifference, did not, in sympathy and moral support, take violent sides\r\nwith _one_ of the combatants; and Mr. Trollope would be first in taking\r\nup the cudgels against private wrong. The North has never wished for\r\nphysical aid from England; but does Mr. Trollope remember what Mrs.\r\nBrowning has so nobly and humanely written? 'Non-intervention in the\r\naffairs of neighboring States is a high political virtue; but\r\nnon-intervention does not mean passing by on the other side when your\r\nneighbor falls among thieves, or Phariseeism would recover it from\r\nChristianity.' England, the greatest of actual nations, had a part to\r\nact in our war, and that part a noble one. Not the part of physical\r\nintervention for the benefit of Lancashire and of a confederacy founded\r\nupon slavery, which both Earl Russell and Lord Palmerston inform the\r\nworld will not take place 'at present.' Not the part of hypercriticism\r\nand misconstruction of Northern 'Orders,' and affectionate blindness to\r\nSouthern atrocities. But such a part as was worthy of the nation, one of\r\nwhose greatest glories is that it gave birth to a Clarkson, a Sharpe,\r\nand a Wilberforce. And England has much to answer for, in that she has\r\nbeen found wanting, not in the cause of the North, but in the cause of\r\nhumanity. Had she not always told us that we were criminals of the\r\ndeepest dye not to do what she had done in the West-Indies, had she not\r\nalways held out to the world the beacon-light of emancipation, there\r\ncould be little censure cast upon the British ermine; but having laid\r\nclaim to so white and moral a robe, she subjects herself to the very\r\nproper indignation of the anti-slavery party which now governs the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope confesses that British sympathy is with the South, and\r\nfurther writes: 'It seems to me that some of us never tire in abusing\r\nthe Americans and calling them names, for having allowed themselves to\r\nbe driven into this civil war. We tell them that they are fools and\r\nidiots; we speak of their doings as though there had been some plain\r\ncourse by which the war might have been avoided; and we throw it in\r\ntheir teeth that they have no capability for war,' etc., etc. Contact\r\nwith the English abroad sent us home convinced of English animosity, and\r\nthis was before the Trent affair. A literary woman writes to America:\r\n'There is only one person to whom I can talk freely upon the affairs of\r\nyour country. Here in England, they say I have lived so long _in Italy\r\nthat I have become an American_.' We have had nothing but abuse from the\r\nEnglish press always, excepting a few of the liberal journals. Mill and\r\nBright and Cobden alone have been prominent in their expression of\r\ngood-will to the North. And this is Abolition England! History will\r\nrecord, that at the time when America was convulsed by the inevitable\r\nstruggle between Freedom and Slavery, England, actuated by selfish\r\nmotives, withheld that moral support and righteous counsel which would\r\nhave deprived the South of much aid and comfort, brought the war to a\r\nspeedier conclusion, gained the grateful confidence of the anti-slavery\r\nNorth, and immeasurably aided the abolition of human slavery.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that we of the North have no intention of touching the\r\n'institution,' and therefore England can not sympathize with us.\r\nWhatever the theory of the administration at Washington may have been,\r\nhe is insane as well as blind who does not see what is its practical\r\ntendency. In the same length of time, this tendency would have been much\r\nfarther on the road to right had the strong arm of England wielded the\r\nmoral power which should belong to it. Mr. Trollope says: 'The complaint\r\nof Americans is, that they have received no sympathy from England; but\r\nit seems to me that a great nation should not require an expression of\r\nsympathy during its struggle. Sympathy is for the weak, not for the\r\nstrong. When I hear two powerful men contending together in argument, I\r\ndo not sympathize with him who has the best of it; but I watch the\r\nprecision of his logic, and acknowledge the effects of his rhetoric.\r\nThere has been a whining weakness in the complaints made by Americans\r\nagainst England, which has done more to lower them, as a people, in my\r\njudgment, than any other part of their conduct during the present\r\ncrisis.' It is true that at the beginning of this war the North _did_\r\nshow a whining weakness for English approbation, of which it is\r\nsincerely to be hoped we have been thoroughly cured. We paid our\r\nmother-land too high a compliment--we gave her credit for virtues which\r\nshe does not possess--and the disappointment incurred thereby has been\r\nbitter in the extreme. We were not aware, however, that a sincere desire\r\nfor sympathy was an American peculiarity. We have long labored under the\r\ndelusion that the English, even, were very indignant with Brother\r\nJonathan during the Crimean war, when he failed to furnish the quota of\r\nsympathy which our cousins considered was their due, but which we could\r\nnot give to a debauched 'sick man' whom, for the good of civilization,\r\nwe wished out of the world as quickly as possible. But England was\r\n'strong;' why should she have desired sympathy? For, according to Mr.\r\nTrollope's creed, the weak alone ought to receive sympathy. It seems to\r\nbe a matter entirely independent of right and wrong with Mr. Trollope.\r\nIt is sufficient for a man to prove his case to be '_strong_,' for Mr.\r\nTrollope to side with his opponent. Demonstrate your weakness, whether\r\nit be physical, moral, or mental, and Mr. Trollope will fight your\r\nbattles for you. On this principle--which, we are told, is English--the\r\nexiled princes of Italy, especially the Neapolitan-Bourbon, the Pope,\r\nAustria, and of course the Southern confederacy, should find their\r\nwarmest sympathizers among true Britons, and perhaps they do; but Mr.\r\nTrollope, in spite of his theory, is not one of them.\r\n\r\nThe emancipationist should _not_ look to England for aid or comfort, but\r\nit will be none the worse for England that she has been false to her\r\ntraditions. 'I confess,' wrote Mrs. Browning--dead now a year--'that I\r\ndream of the day when an English statesman shall arise with a heart too\r\nlarge for England, having courage, in the face of his countrymen, to\r\nassert of some suggested policy: 'This is good for your trade, this is\r\nnecessary for your domination; but it will vex a people hard by, it will\r\nhurt a people farther off, it will profit nothing to the general\r\nhumanity; therefore, away with it! it is not for you or for me.'' The\r\njustice of the poet yet reigns in heaven only; and dare we dream--we\r\nwho, sick at heart, are weighed down by the craft and dishonesty of our\r\npublic men--of the possibility of such a golden age?\r\n\r\nOn the subject of religion as well, we are much at variance with Mr.\r\nTrollope. Of course, it is to be expected that one who says, 'I love the\r\nname of State and Church, and believe that much of our English\r\nwell-being has depended on it; _I have made up my mind to think that\r\nunion good, and am not to be turned away from that conviction_;' it is\r\nto be expected, we repeat, that such an one should consider religion in\r\nthe States 'rowdy.' Surely, we will not quarrel with Mr. Trollope for\r\nthis opinion, however much we may regret it; as we consider it the glory\r\nof this country, that while we claim for our moral foundation a fervent\r\nbelief in GOD and an abiding faith in the necessity of\r\nreligion, our government pays no premium to hypocrisy by having fastened\r\nto its shirts one creed above all other creeds, made thereby more\r\nrespectable and more fashionable. 'It is a part of their system,' Mr.\r\nTrollope continues, 'that religion shall be perfectly free, and that no\r\nman shall be in any way constrained in that matter,' (and he sees\r\nnothing to thank God for in this system of ours!) 'consequently, the\r\nquestion of a man's religion is regarded in a free-and-easy manner.'\r\nThat which we have gladly dignified by the name of religious toleration,\r\n(not yet half as broad as it should and will be,) Mr. Trollope degrades\r\nby the epithet of 'free-and-easy.' This would better apply were ours the\r\ntoleration of indifference, instead of being a toleration founded upon\r\nthe unshaken belief that God has endowed every human being with a\r\nconscience whose sufficiency unto itself, in matters of religious faith,\r\nwe have no right to question. And we are convinced that this experiment,\r\nwith which we started, has been good for our growth of mind and soul, as\r\nwell as for our growth as a nation. Even Mr. Trollope qualifies our\r\n'rowdyism,' by saying that 'the nation is religious in its tendencies,\r\nand prone to acknowledge the goodness of God in all things.'\r\n\r\nAnd now we have done with fault-finding. For all that we hereafter quote\r\nfrom Mr. Trollope's book, we at once express our thanks and _sympathy_.\r\nHe is '_strong_,' but he is also human, and likes sympathy.\r\n\r\nMore than true, if such a thing could be, is Mr. Trollope's comments\r\nupon American politicians. 'The corruption of the venal politicians of\r\nthe nation stinks aloud in the nostrils of all men. It behoves the\r\ncountry to look to this. It is time now that she should do so. The\r\npeople of the nation are educated and clever. The women are bright and\r\nbeautiful. Her charity is profuse; her philanthropy is eager and true;\r\nher national ambition is noble and honest--honest in the cause of\r\ncivilization. But she has soiled herself with political corruption, and\r\nhas disgraced the cause of republican government by those whom she has\r\nplaced in her high places. Let her look to it NOW. She is nobly\r\nambitious of reputation throughout the earth; she desires to be called\r\ngood as well as great; to be regarded not only as powerful, but also as\r\nbeneficent She is creating an army; she is forging cannon, and preparing\r\nto build impregnable ships of war. But all these will fail to satisfy\r\nher pride, unless she can cleanse herself from that corruption by which\r\nher political democracy has debased itself. A politician should be a man\r\nworthy of all honor, in that he loves his country; and not one worthy of\r\ncontempt, in that he robs his country.' Can we plead other than guilty,\r\nwhen even now a Senator of the United States stands convicted of a\r\nmiserable betrayal of his office? Will America heed the voice of Europe,\r\nas well as of her best friends at home, before it is too late? Again\r\nwrites Mr. Trollope: ''It is better to have little governors than great\r\ngovernors,' an American said to me once. 'It is our glory that we know\r\nhow to live without having great men over us to rule us.' That glory, if\r\never it were a glory, has come to an end. It seems to me that all these\r\ntroubles have come upon the States because they have not placed high men\r\nin high places.' Is there a thinking American who denies the truth of\r\nthis? And of our code of honesty--that for which Englishmen are most to\r\nbe commended--what is truly said of us? 'It is not by foreign voices, by\r\nEnglish newspapers, or in French pamphlets, that the corruption of\r\nAmerican politicians has been exposed, but by American voices and by the\r\nAmerican press. It is to be heard on every side. Ministers of the\r\nCabinet, Senators, Representatives, State Legislatures, officers of the\r\narmy, officials of the navy, contractors of every grade--all who are\r\npresumed to touch, or to have the power of touching, public money, are\r\nthus accused.... The leaders of the rebellion are hated in the North.\r\nThe names of Jefferson Davis, Cobb, Toombs, and Floyd, are mentioned\r\nwith execration by the very children. This has sprung from a true and\r\nnoble feeling; from a patriotic love of national greatness, and a hatred\r\nof those who, for small party purposes, have been willing to lessen the\r\nname of the United States. But, in addition to this, the names of those\r\nalso should be execrated who have robbed their country when pretending\r\nto serve it; who have taken its wages in the days of its great struggle,\r\nand at the same time have filched from its coffers; who have undertaken\r\nthe task of steering the ship through the storm, in order that their\r\nhands might be deep in the meal-tub and the bread-basket, and that they\r\nmight stuff their own sacks with the ship's provisions. These are the\r\nmen who must be loathed by the nation--whose fate must be held up as a\r\nwarning to others--before good can come.' How long are the American\r\npeople to allow this pool of iniquity to stagnate, and sap the vitals of\r\nthe nation? How long, O Lord! how long?\r\n\r\nOn the subject of education, Mr. Trollope--though indulging in a little\r\npleasantry on young girls who analyze Milton--does us full justice. 'The\r\none matter in which, as far as my judgment goes, the people of the\r\nUnited States have excelled us Englishmen, so as to justify them in\r\ntaking to themselves praise which we can not take to ourselves or refuse\r\nto them, is the matter of education.... The coachman who drives you, the\r\nman who mends your window, the boy who brings home your purchases, the\r\ngirl who stitches your wife's dress--they all carry with them sure signs\r\nof education, and show it in every word they utter.' But much as Mr.\r\nTrollope admires our system of public schools, he does not see much to\r\nextol in the at least Western way of rearing children. 'I must protest\r\nthat American babies are an unhappy race. They eat and drink just as\r\nthey please; they are never punished; they are never banished, snubbed,\r\nand kept in the background, as children are kept with us; and yet they\r\nare wretched and uncomfortable. My heart has bled for them as I have\r\nheard them squalling, by the hour together, in agonies of discontent and\r\ndyspepsia.' This is the type of child found by Mr. Trollope on Western\r\nsteamboats; and we agree with him that beef-steaks, _with pickles_,\r\nproduce a bad type of child; and it is unnecessary to confess to Mr.\r\nTrollope what he already knows, that pertness and irreverence to parents\r\nare the great faults of American youth. No doubt the pickles have much\r\nto do with this state of things.\r\n\r\nWhile awarding high praise to American women _en masse_, Mr. Trollope\r\nmourns over the condition of the Western women with whom he came in\r\ncontact, and we are sorry to think that these specimens form the rule,\r\nthough of course exceptions are very numerous. 'A Western American man\r\nis not a talking man. He will sit for hours over a stove, with his cigar\r\nin his mouth and his hat over his eyes, chewing the cud of reflection. A\r\ndozen will sit together in the same way, and there shall not be a dozen\r\nwords spoken between them in an hour. With the women, one's chance of\r\nconversation is still worse. 'It seemed as though the cares of this\r\nworld had been too much for them.... They were generally hard, dry, and\r\nmelancholy. I am speaking, of course, of aged females, from\r\nfive-and-twenty, perhaps, to thirty, who had long since given up the\r\namusements and levities of life.' Mr. Trollope's malediction upon the\r\nwomen of New-York whom he met in the street-cars, is well merited, so\r\nfar as many of them are concerned; but he should bear in mind the fact\r\nthat these 'many' are foreigners, mostly uneducated natives of the\r\nBritish isles. Inexcusable as is the advantage which such women\r\nsometimes take of American gallantry, the spirit of this gallantry is\r\nnone the less to be commended, and the grateful smile of thanks from\r\nAmerican ladies is not so rare as Mr. Trollope imagines. Mr. Trollope\r\nwants the gallantry abolished; we hope that rude women may learn a\r\nbetter appreciation of this gallantry by its abolition in flagrant cases\r\nonly. Had Mr. Trollope once 'learned the ways' of New-York stages, he\r\nwould not have found them such vile conveyances; but we quite agree with\r\nhim in advocating the introduction of cabs. In seeing nothing but\r\nvulgarity in Fifth Avenue, and a thirst for gold all over New-York City,\r\nwe think Mr. Trollope has given way to prejudice. There is no city so\r\ngenerous in the spending of money as New-York. Art and literature find\r\ntheir best patrons in this much-abused Gotham; and it will not do for\r\none who lives in a glass house to throw stones, for we are not the only\r\nnation of shop-keepers. We do not blame Mr. Trollope, however, for\r\ngiving his love to Boston, and to the men and women of intellect who\r\nhave homes in and about Boston.\r\n\r\nWe are of opinion that Mr. Trollope is too severe upon our hotels; for\r\nfaulty though they be, they are established upon a vastly superior plan\r\nto those of any other country, if we are to believe our own experience\r\nand that of the majority of travelers. Mr. Trollope sees no use of a\r\nladies' parlor; but Mr. Trollope would soon see its indispensability\r\nwere he to travel as an unprotected female of limited means. On the\r\nmatter of the Post-Office, however, he has both our ears; and much that\r\nhe says of our government, and the need of a constitutional change in\r\nour Constitution, deserves attention--likewise what he says of\r\ncolonization. We do elevate unworthy persons to the altar of heroism,\r\nand are stupid in our blatant eulogies. It is sincerely to be regretted\r\nthat so honest a writer did not devote two separate chapters to the\r\nimportant subjects of drunkenness and artificial heat, which, had he\r\nknown us better, he would have known were undermining the American\r\n_physique_. He does treat passingly of our hot-houses, but seems not to\r\nhave faced the worse evil. Of our literature, and of our absorption of\r\nEnglish literature, Mr. Trollope has spoken fully and well; and in his\r\nplea for a national copyright, he might have further argued its\r\nnecessity, from the fact that American publishers will give no\r\nencouragement to unknown native writers, however clever, so long as they\r\ncan steal the brains of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. We like Mr. Trollope's book, for we believe him when he\r\nsays: 'I have endeavored to judge without prejudice, and to hear with\r\nhonest ears, and to see with honest eyes.' We have the firmest faith in\r\nMr. Trollope's honesty. We know he has written nothing that he does not\r\nconscientiously believe, and he has given unmistakable evidence of his\r\ngood-will to this country. We are lost in amazement when he tells us: 'I\r\nknow I shall never again be at Boston, and that I have said that about\r\nthe Americans which would make me unwelcome as a guest if I were\r\nthere.' Said what? We should be thin-skinned, indeed, did we take\r\numbrage at a book written in the spirit of Mr. Trollope's. On the\r\ncontrary, the Americans who are interested in it are agreeably\r\ndisappointed in the verdict which he has given of them; and though they\r\nmay not accept his political opinions, they are sensible enough to\r\nappreciate the right of each man to his honest convictions. Mr.\r\nTrollope, though he sees in our future not two, but three,\r\nconfederacies, predicts a great destiny for the North. We can see but a\r\nunion of all--a Union cemented by the triumph of freedom in the\r\nabolition of that which has been the taint upon the nation. If Mr.\r\nTrollope's prophecies are fulfilled, (and God forbid!) it will be\r\nbecause we have allowed the golden hour to escape. Pleased as we are\r\nwith Mr. Trollope the writer--who has not failed to appreciate the\r\nself-sacrifice of Northern patriotism--Mr. Trollope the _man_ has a far\r\ngreater hold upon our heart; a hold which has been strengthened, rather\r\nthan weakened, by his book. The friends of Mr. Trollope extend to him\r\ntheir cordial greeting, and Boston in particular will offer a hearty\r\nshake of the hand to the writer of _North-America_, whenever he chooses\r\nto take that hand again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP AND ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who is not convinced, by this time, that the Union has come to\r\n'the bitter need,' must be hard to convince. For more than one year we\r\nhave put off doing our _utmost_, and talked incessantly of the 'wants of\r\nthe enemy.' We have demonstrated a thousand times that they wanted\r\nquinine and calomel, beef and brandy, with every other comfort, luxury,\r\nand necessary, and have ended by discovering that they have forced every\r\nman into their army; that they have, at all events, abundance of\r\ncorn-meal, raised by the negroes whom Northern Conservatism has dreaded\r\nto free; that they are well supplied with arms from Abolition England,\r\nand that every day finds them more and more warlike and inured to war.\r\n\r\nTime was, we are told, when a bold, 'radical push' would have prevented\r\nall this. Time was, when those who urged such vigorous and overwhelming\r\nmeasures--and we were among them--were denounced as insane and\r\ntraitorous by the Northern Conservative press. Time was, when the\r\nIrishman's policy of capturing a horse in a hundred-acre lot, 'by\r\nsurrounding him,' might have been advantageously exchanged for the more\r\ndirect course of going _at_ him. Time _was_, when there were very few\r\ntroops in Richmond. All this when time--and very precious time--was.\r\n\r\nJust now, time _is_--and very little time to lose, either. The rebels,\r\nit seems, can live on corn-meal and whisky as well under tents as they\r\nonce did in cabins. They are building rams and 'iron-clads,' and very\r\ngood ones. They have an immense army, and three or four millions of\r\nnegroes to plant for it and feed it. Hundreds of thousands of acres of\r\ngood corn-land are waving in the hot breezes of Dixie. These are facts\r\nof the strongest kind--so strong that we have actually been compelled to\r\nadopt some few of the 'radical and ruinous' measures advocated from the\r\nbeginning by 'an insane and fanatical band of traitors,' for whose blood\r\nthe New-York _Herald_ and its weakly ape, the Boston _Courier_, have not\r\nyet ceased to howl or chatter. Negroes, it seems, are, after all, to be\r\nemployed sometimes, and all the work is not to be put upon soldiers who,\r\nas the correspondent of the London _Times_ has truly said, have endured\r\ndisasters and sufferings caused by unpardonable neglect, such as _no_\r\nEuropean troops would have borne without revolt. It is even thought by\r\nsome hardy and very desperate 'radicals,' that negroes may be armed and\r\nmade to fight for the Union; in fact, it is quite possible that, should\r\nthe North succeed in resisting the South a year or two longer, or should\r\nwe undergo a few more _very_ great disasters, we may go so far as to\r\nbelieve what a great French writer has declared in a work on Military\r\nArt, that 'War is war, and he wages it best who injures his enemy most.'\r\nWe are aware of the horror which this fanatical radical, and, of course,\r\nAbolitionist axiom, by a writer of the school of Napoleon, must inspire,\r\nand therefore qualify the assertion by the word 'may.' For to believe\r\nthat the main props of the enemy are to be knocked away from under them,\r\nand that we are to fairly fight them in _every_ way, involves a\r\ndesperate and un-Christian state of mind to which no one should yield,\r\nand which would, in fact, be impious, nay, even un-democratic and\r\nun-conservative.\r\n\r\nIt is true that by 'throwing grass' at the enemy, as President Lincoln\r\nquaintly terms it, by the anaconda game, and above all, by constantly\r\nyelling, 'No nigger!' and 'Down with the Abolitionists!' we have\r\ncontrived to lose some forty thousand good soldiers' lives by disease;\r\nto stand where we were, and to have myriads of men paralyzed and kept\r\nback from war just at the instant when their zeal was most needed. We\r\nbeg our readers to seriously reflect on this last fact. There are\r\nnumbers of essential and bold steps in this war, and against the enemy,\r\nwhich _must_, in the ordinary course of events, be taken, as for\r\ninstance. General Hunter's policy of employing negroes, as General\r\nJackson did. With such a step, _honestly_ considered, no earthly\r\npolitics whatever has any thing to do. Yet every one of these sheer\r\nnecessities of war which a Napoleon would have grasped at the _first_,\r\nhave been promptly opposed as radical, traitorous, and infernal, by\r\nthose tories who are only waiting for the South to come in again to rush\r\nand lick its hands as of old. Every measure, from the first arming of\r\ntroops down to the employment of blacks, has been fought by these\r\n'reactionaries' savagely, step by step--we might add, in parenthesis,\r\nthat it has been amusing to see how they 'ate dirt,' took back their\r\nwords and praised these very measures, one by one, as soon as they saw\r\nthem taken up by the Administration. The _ecco la fica_ of Italian\r\nhistory was a small humiliation to that which the 'democratic' press\r\npresented when it glorified Lincoln's 'remuneration message,' and gilded\r\nthe pill by declaring it (Heaven knows how!) a splendid triumph over\r\nAbolition--that same remuneration doctrine which, when urged in the\r\nNew-York _Tribune_, and in these pages, had been reviled as fearfully\r\n'abolition!'\r\n\r\nHowever, all these conservative attacks in succession on every measure\r\nwhich any one could see would become necessities from a merely military\r\npoint of view, have had their inevitable result: they have got into the\r\nWest, and have aided Secession, as in many cases they were intended to\r\ndo. The plain, blunt man, seeing what _must_ be adopted if the war is to\r\nbe carried on in earnest, and yet hearing that these inevitable\r\nexpediencies were all 'abolition,' became confused and disheartened. So\r\nthat it is as true as Gospel, that in the West, where 'Abolition' has\r\nkept one man back from the Union, 'Conservatism' has kept ten. And the\r\nproof may be found that while in the West, as in the East, the better\r\neducated, more intelligent, and more energetic minds, have at once\r\ncomprehended the necessities of the war, and dared the whole, 'call it\r\nAbolition or not,' the blinder and more illiterate, who were afraid of\r\nbeing 'called' Abolitionists, have kept back, or remained by Secession\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAs we write, a striking proof of our news comes before us in a remark in\r\nan influential and able Western conservative journal, the Nebraska\r\n_News_, The remark in question is to the effect that the proposition\r\nmade by us in THE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, to partition the\r\nconfiscated real estate of the South among the soldiers of the Federal\r\narmy is nothing more nor less than 'a bribe for patriotism.' That is the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nNow, politics apart--abolition or no abolition--we presume there are not\r\nten rational men in the country who believe that the proposition to\r\ncolonize Texas in particular, with free labor, or to settle free\r\nNorthern soldiers in the cotton country of the South, is other than\r\njudicious and common-sensible. If it will make our soldiers fight any\r\nbetter, it certainly is not very much to be deprecated. To settle\r\ndisbanded volunteers in the South so as to gradually drive away slave\r\nlabor by the superior value of free labor on lands confiscated or\r\npublic, is certainly not a very reprehensible proposition. But it\r\noriginated, as all the more advanced political proposals of the day do,\r\nwith men who favor Emancipation, present or prospective, and _therefore_\r\nit must be cried down! The worst possible construction is put upon it.\r\nIt is 'a bribe for patriotism,' and must not be thought of. 'Better lose\r\nthe victory,' says Conservatism, 'rather than inspire the zeal of our\r\nsoldiers by offering any tangible reward!' We beg our thousands of\r\nreaders in the army to note this. Since we first proposed in these\r\ncolumns to _properly_ reward the army by giving to each man his share of\r\ncotton-land, [we did not even go so far as to insist that the land\r\nshould absolutely be confiscated, knowing well, and declaring, that\r\nTexas contains public land enough for this purpose,] the\r\ndemocratic-conservative-pro-slavery press, especially of the West, has\r\nattacked the scheme with unwonted vigor. For the West _understands_ the\r\nstrength latent in this proposal better than the East; it _knows_ what\r\ncan be done when free Northern vigor goes to planting and town-building;\r\nit 'knows how the thing is done;' it 'has been there,' and sees in our\r\n'bribe for patriotism' the most deadly blow ever struck at Southern\r\nAristocracy. Consequently those men who abuse Emancipation in its every\r\nform, violently oppose our proposal to give the army such reward as\r\ntheir services merit, and such as their residence in the South renders\r\npeculiarly fit. It is 'a bribe;' it is extravagant; it--yes--it is\r\nAbolition! The army is respectfully requested not to think of settling\r\nin the South, but to hobble back to alms-houses in order that Democracy\r\nmay carry its elections and settle down in custom-houses and other snug\r\nretreats.\r\n\r\nAnd what do the anti-energy, anti-action, anti-contraband-digging,\r\nanti-every thing practical and go-ahead in the war gentlemen propose to\r\ngive the soldier in exchange for his cotton-land? Let the soldier\r\nexamine coolly, if he can, the next bullet-wound in his leg. He will\r\nperceive a puncture which will probably, when traced around the edge and\r\ncarefully copied, present that circular form generally assigned to\r\na--cipher. _This_ represents, we believe, with tolerable accuracy, what\r\nthe anti-actionists and reactionists propose to give the soldier as a\r\nrecompense for that leg. For so truly as we live, so true is it that\r\nthere is not _one_ anti-Emancipationist in the North who is not opposed\r\nto settling the army or any portion of it in the South, simply because\r\nto do any thing which may in any way interfere with 'the Institution,'\r\nor jar Southern aristocracy, forms no part of their platform!\r\n\r\nWe believe this to be as plain a fact as was ever yet submitted to\r\nliving man.\r\n\r\nNow, are we to go to work in earnest, to boldly grasp at every means of\r\nhonorable warfare, as France or England would do in our case, and\r\noverwhelm the South, or are we going to let it alone? Are we, for years\r\nto come, to slowly fight our way from one small war-expediency to\r\nanother, as it may please the mongrel puppies of Democracy to gradually\r\nget their eyes opened or not? Are we to arm the blacks by and by, or\r\nwait till they shall have planted another corn-crop for the enemy? Shall\r\nwe inspire the soldiers by promising them cotton-lands now, or wait till\r\nwe get to the street of By and By, which leads to the house of Never?\r\nWould we like to have our victory now, or wait till we get it?\r\n\r\nUp and act! We are waiting for grass to grow while the horse is\r\nstarving! Let the Administration no longer hold back, for lo! the people\r\nare ready and willing, and one grasp at a fiercely brave, _decided_\r\npolicy would send a roar of approval from ocean to ocean. One tenth part\r\nof the wild desire to adopt instant and energetic measures which is now\r\nstruggling into life among the people, would, if transferred to their\r\nleaders, send opposition, North and South, howling to Hades. We find the\r\nirrepressible discontent gathering around like a thunder-storm. It\r\nreaches us in letters. We _know_ that it is growing tremendously in the\r\narmy--the discontent which demands a bold policy, active measures, and\r\none great overwhelming blow. Every woman cries for it--it is everywhere!\r\nMr. Lincoln, you have waited for the people, and we tell you that the\r\npeople are now ready. The three hundred thousand volunteers are coming\r\nbravely on; but, we tell you, DRAFT! That's the thing. The very\r\nword has already sent a chill through the South. _They_ have seen what\r\ncan be done by bold, overwhelming military measures; by driving _every_\r\nman into arms; by being headlong and fearless; and know that it has put\r\nthem at once on equality with us--they, the half minority! And they\r\nknow, too, that when WE once begin the 'big game,' all will be up with\r\nthem. We have more than twice as many men here, and their own blacks are\r\nbut a broken reed. When we begin to _draft_, however, war will begin _in\r\nearnest_. They dread that drafting far more than volunteering. They know\r\nby experience, what we have not as yet learned, that drafting contains\r\nmany strange secrets of success. It is a _bold_ conscriptive measure,\r\nand indicates serious strength and the _consciousness_ of strength in\r\ngovernment. Our government has hitherto lain half-asleep, half-awake, a\r\ngreat, good-natured giant, now and then rolling over and crushing some\r\nof the rats running over his bed, and now and then getting very badly\r\nbitten. Wake up, Giant Samuel, all in the morning early! The rats are\r\ncoming down on thee, old friend, not by scores, but by tens of\r\nthousands! Jump up, my jolly giant! for verily, things begin to look\r\nserious. You must play the Wide-Awake game now; grasp your stick, knock\r\nthem right and left; call in the celebrated dog Halleck, who can kill\r\nhis thousand rats an hour, and cry to Sambo to carry out the dead and\r\nbury them! It's rats _now_, friend Samuel, if it ever was!\r\n\r\nCan not the North play the entire game, and shake out the bag, as well\r\nas the South? They have bundled out every man and dollar, dog, cat, and\r\ntenpenny nail into the war, and done it _gloriously_. They have stopped\r\nat nothing, feared nothing, believed in nothing but victory. Now let the\r\nNorth step out! Life and wife, lands and kin, will be of small value if\r\nwe are to lose this battle and become the citizens of a broken country,\r\ngoing backward instead of forward--a country with a past, but no future.\r\nBetter draw every man into the army, and leave the women to hoe and\r\nreap, ere we come to that. _Draft_, Abraham Lincoln--draft, in\r\nGOD'S name! Let us have one rousing, tremendous pull at\r\nvictory! Send out such armies as never were seen before. The West has\r\ngrain enough to feed them, and tide what may betide, you can arm them.\r\nLet us try what WE can do when it comes to the last emergency.\r\n\r\nWhen we arise in our _full_ strength, England and France and the South\r\nwill be as gnats in the flame before us. And there is no time to lose.\r\nFrance is 'tinkering away' at Mexico; foreign cannon are to pass from\r\nMexico into the South; our foe is considering the aggressive policy.\r\nAbraham Lincoln, _the time has come!_ Canada is to attack from the\r\nNorth, and France from Mexico. Your three hundred thousand are a trifle;\r\ndraw out your million; draw the last man who can bear arms--_and let it\r\nbe done quickly!_ This is your policy. Let the blows rain thick and\r\nfast. Hurrah! Uncle Samuel--the rats are running! Strike quick,\r\nthough--_very_ quick--and you will be saved!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF ANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll public exhibitions have their peculiar physiognomies. During the\r\npassage of General Jackson through Philadelphia, there was a very strong\r\nparty opposed to him, which gave a feature to the show differing from\r\nothers we had witnessed, but which became subdued in a degree by his\r\nappearance. A firm and imposing figure on horseback, General Jackson was\r\nperfectly at home in the saddle. Dressed in black, with a broad-brimmed\r\nwhite beaver hat, craped in consequence of the recent death of his wife,\r\nhe bowed with composed ease and a somewhat military grace to the\r\nmultitude. His tall, thin, bony frame, surmounted by a venerable,\r\nweather-beaten, strongly-lined and original countenance, with stiff,\r\nupright, gray hair, changed the opinion which some had previously\r\nformed. His military services were important, his career undoubtedly\r\npatriotic; but he had interfered with many and deep interests. There was\r\nmuch dissentient humming.\r\n\r\nThe General bowed right and left, lifting his hat often from his head,\r\nappearing at the same time dignified and kind. When the cavalcade first\r\nmarched down Chestnut street, there was no immediate escort, or it did\r\nnot act efficiently. Rude fellows on horseback, of the roughest\r\ndescription, sat sideling on their torn saddles just before the\r\nPresident, gazing vacantly in his face as they would from the gallery of\r\na theatre, but interrupting the view of his person from other portions\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nJames Reeside, the celebrated mail-contractor, became very much provoked\r\nat one of these fellows. Reeside rode a powerful horse before the\r\nPresident, and with a heavy, long-lashed riding-whip in his hand,\r\nattempted to drive the man's broken-down steed out of the way. But the\r\nanimal was as impervious to feeling as the rider to sense or decency,\r\nand Reeside had little influence over a dense crowd, till the escort\r\nexercised a proper authority in front. I saw the General smile at\r\nReeside's eagerness to clear the way for him. Of course, this sketch is\r\na glimpse at a certain point where the procession passed me. I viewed it\r\nagain in Arch street, and noticed the calmness with which the General\r\nsaluted a crowd of negroes who suddenly gave him a hearty cheer from the\r\nwall of a graveyard where they were perched. He had just taken off his\r\nhat to some ladies waving handkerchiefs on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet, when he heard the huzza, and replied by a salutation to the\r\nunexpected but not despised color.\r\n\r\nAfter the fatigue of the parade, when invited to take some refreshment,\r\nJackson asked for boiled rice and milk at dinner. There was some slight\r\ndelay to procure them, but he declined any thing else.\r\n\r\nI recollect an anecdote of Daniel Webster in relation to General\r\nJackson, which I wish to preserve. On some public occasion, an\r\nentertainment was given, under large tents, near Point-no-Point, in\r\nPhiladelphia county, which the representatives to the Legislature were\r\ngenerally invited to attend. Political antipathies and prejudices were\r\nexcessive at that day. No moderate person was tolerated, in the\r\nslightest degree, by the more violent opponents of the Administration.\r\nMr. Webster was present, and rose to speak. His intelligent and serious\r\nair of grave thought was impressively felt. He spoke his objections to a\r\ncertain policy of the Administration with a gentle firmness. I sat near\r\nhim. One of his intolerant friends made an inquiry, either at the close\r\nof a short dinner-table address, or during his speech, if 'he was not\r\nstill in the practice of visiting at the White House?' I saw Webster's\r\nbrow become clouded, as he calmly but slowly explained, 'His position as\r\nSenator required him to have occasional intercourse with the President\r\nof the United States, whose views upon some points of national policy\r\ndiffered widely from those he (Webster) was well known to entertain;'\r\nwhen, as if his noble spirit became suddenly aware of the narrow\r\nmeanness that had induced the question, he raised himself to his full\r\nhight, and looking firmly at his audience, with a pause, till he caught\r\nthe eye of the inquirer, he continued: 'I hope to God, gentlemen, never\r\nto live to see the day when a Senator of the United States _can not_\r\ncall upon the Chief Magistrate of the nation, on account of _any_\r\ndifferences in opinion either may possess upon public affairs!' This\r\nhonorable, patriotic, and liberal expression was most cordially\r\napplauded by all parties. Many left that meeting with a sense of relief\r\nfrom the oppression of political intolerance, so nearly allied to the\r\ntyranny of religious bigotry.\r\n\r\nI had been introduced, and was sitting with a number of gentlemen in a\r\ncircle round the fire of the President's room, when James Buchanan\r\npresented himself for the first time, as a Senator of the United States\r\nfrom his native State. 'I am happy to see you, Mr. Buchanan,' said\r\nGeneral Jackson, rising and shaking him heartily by the hand, 'both\r\npersonally and politically. Sit down, sir.' The conversation was social.\r\nSome one brought in a lighted corn-cob pipe, with a long reed-stalk, for\r\nthe President to smoke. He appeared waiting for it. As he puffed at it,\r\na Western man asked some question about the fire which had been reported\r\nat the Hermitage. The answer made was, 'it had not been much injured,' I\r\nthink, 'but the family had moved temporarily into a log-house,' in\r\nwhich, the General observed, 'he had spent some of the happiest days of\r\nhis life.' He then, as if excited by old recollections, told us he had\r\nan excellent plantation, fine cattle, noble horses, a large still-house,\r\nand so on. 'Why, General,' laughed his Western friend, 'I thought I saw\r\nyour name, the other day, along with those of other prominent men,\r\nadvocating the cold-water system?' 'I did sign something of the kind,'\r\nreplied the veteran, very coolly puffing at his pipe, 'but I had a very\r\ngood distillery, for all that!' Before markets became convenient, almost\r\nall large plantations had stills to use up the surplus grains, which\r\ncould not be sold to a profit near home. Tanneries and blacksmiths'\r\nshops were also accompaniments, for essential convenience.\r\n\r\nMartin, the President's door-keeper, was very independent, at times, to\r\nvisitors at the White House, especially if he had been indulging with\r\nhis friends, as was now and then the case. But he was somewhat\r\nprivileged, on account of his fidelity and humor. Upon one occasion he\r\ngave great offense to some water-drinking Democrats--rather a rare\r\nspecimen at that day--who complained to the President. He promised to\r\nspeak to Martin about it. The first opportunity--early, while Martin was\r\ncool--the President sent for him in private, and mentioned the\r\nobjection. 'Och! Jineral, dear!' said Martin, looking him earnestly in\r\nthe face, 'I'de hev enough to do ef I give ear to all the nonsense\r\npeople tell me, even about yerself, Jineral! I wonther _who_ folks don't\r\ncomplain about, now-a-days? But if they are friends of yours, Jineral,\r\nthey maybe hed cause, ef I could only recollict what it was! So we'll\r\njist let it pass by this time, ef you plase, sur!' Martin remained in\r\nhis station. When the successor of Mr. Van Buren came in, the\r\ndoor-keeper presented himself soon after to the new President, with the\r\ncivil inquiry: 'I suppose I'll hev to flit, too, with the _other_\r\nMartin?' He was smilingly told to be easy.\r\n\r\nI saw General Jackson riding in an open carriage, in earnest\r\nconversation with his successor, as I was on the way to the Capitol to\r\nwitness the inaugural oath. A few days after, I shook hands with him for\r\nthe last time, as he sat in a railroad-car, about to leave Washington\r\nfor the West. Crowds of all classes leaped up to offer such salutations,\r\nall of whom he received with the same easy, courteous, decided manner he\r\nhad exhibited on other occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKSPEARE'S CARICATURE OF RICHARD III.\r\n\r\n\r\n'The youth of England have been said to take their religion from Milton,\r\nand their history from Shakspeare:' and as far as they draw the\r\ncharacter of the last royal Plantagenet from the bloody ogre which every\r\ngrand tragedian has delighted to personate, they set up invention on the\r\npedestal of fact, and prefer slander to truth. Even from the opening\r\nsoliloquy, Shakspeare traduces, misrepresents, vilifies the man he had\r\ninterested motives in making infamous; while at the death of Jack Cade,\r\na cutting address is made to the future monarch upon his deformity, just\r\nTWO _years before his birth!_ There is no sufficient authority for his\r\nhaving been\r\n\r\n  'Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\r\n  Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time\r\n  Into this breathing world, scarce half-made up,\r\n  And that so lamely and unfashionable,\r\n  The dogs bark at me, as I halt by them.'\r\n\r\nA Scotch commission addressed him with praise of the 'princely majesty\r\nand royal authority sparkling in his face.' Rev. Dr. Shaw's discourse to\r\nthe Londoners, dwells upon the Protector's likeness to the noble Duke,\r\nhis father: his mother was a beauty, his brothers were handsome: a\r\nmonstrous contrast on Richard's part would have been alluded to by the\r\naccurate Philip de Comines: the only remaining print of his person is at\r\nleast fair: the immensely heavy armor of the times may have bowed his\r\nform a little, and no doubt he was pale, and a little higher shouldered\r\non the right than the left side: but, if Anne always loved him, as is\r\nnow proved, and the princess Elizabeth sought his affection after the\r\nQueen's decease, he could not have been the hideous dwarf at which dogs\r\nhowl. Nay, so far from there being an atom of truth in that famous\r\nwooing scene which provokes from Richard the sarcasm:\r\n\r\n  'Was ever woman in this humor wooed?\r\n  Was ever woman in this humor won?'\r\n\r\nRichard actually detected her in the disguise of a kitchen-girl, at\r\nLondon, and renewed his early attachment in the court of the Archbishop\r\nof York. And while Anne was never in her lifetime charged with\r\ninsensibility to the death of her relatives, or lack of feeling, she\r\ndied not from any cruelty of his, but from weakness, and especially from\r\ngrief over her boy's sudden decease. Richard indeed 'loved her early,\r\nloved her late,' and could neither have desired nor designed a calamity\r\nwhich lost him many English hearts. The burial of Henry VI. Richard\r\nhimself solemnized with great state; a favor that no one of Henry's\r\nparty was brave and generous enough to return to the last crowned head\r\nof the rival house.\r\n\r\nGloucester did not need to urge on the well-deserved doom of Clarence:\r\nboth Houses of Parliament voted it; King Edward plead for it; the\r\nomnipotent relatives of the Queen hastened it with characteristic\r\nmalice; they may have honestly believed that the peaceful succession of\r\nthe crown was in peril so long as this plotting traitor lived. No doubt\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nIt is next to certain that Richard did not stab Henry VI., nor the\r\nmurdered son of Margaret, though he had every provocation in the insults\r\nshowered upon his father; was devotedly attached to King Edward, and\r\nhazarded for him person and life with a constancy then unparalleled and\r\na zeal rewarded by his brother's entire confidence.\r\n\r\nCertain names wear a halter in history, and his was one. Richard I. was\r\nassassinated in the siege of Chalone Castle; Richard II. was murdered at\r\nPomfret; Richard, Earl of Southampton, was executed for treason;\r\nRichard, Duke of York, was beheaded with insult; his son, Richard III.,\r\nfell by the perfidy of his nobles; Richard, the last Duke of York, was\r\nprobably murdered by his uncle, in the Tower.\r\n\r\nAt the decease of his brother Edward, the Duke of Gloucester was not\r\nonly the first prince of the blood royal, but was also a consummate\r\nstatesman, intrepid soldier, generous giver, and prompt executor,\r\nnaturally compassionate, as is proved by his large pensions to the\r\nfamilies of his enemies, to Lady Hastings, Lady Rivers, the Duchess of\r\nBuckingham, and the rest; peculiarly devout, too, according to a pattern\r\nthen getting antiquated, as is shown by his endowing colleges of\r\npriests, and bestowing funds for masses in his own behalf and others.\r\nShakspeare never loses an opportunity of painting Gloucester's piety as\r\nsheer hypocrisy, but it was not thought so then; for there was a growing\r\nProtestant party whom all these Romanist manifestations of the highest\r\nnobleman in England greatly offended, not to say alarmed.\r\n\r\nRichard's change of virtual into actual sovereignty, in other words, the\r\nLord Protector's usurpation of the crown, was not done by violence: in\r\nhis first royal procession he was unattended by troops; a fickle,\r\nintriguing, ambitious, and warlike nobility approved the change;\r\nBuckingham, Catesby, and others, urged it. No doubt he himself saw that\r\nthe crown was not a fit plaything for a twelve years' old boy, in such a\r\ntime of frequent treason, ferocious crime, and general recklessness.\r\nThere is no question but what, as Richard had more head than any man in\r\nEngland, he was best fitted to be at its head.\r\n\r\nThe great mystery requiring to be explained is, not that 'the\r\nLancastrian partialities of Shakspeare have,' as Walter Scott said,\r\n'turned history upside down,' and since the battle of Bosworth, no party\r\nhave had any interest in vindicating an utterly ruined cause, but how\r\nsuch troops of nobles revolted against a monarch alike brave and\r\nresolute, wise in council and energetic in act, generous to reward, but\r\nfearful to punish.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I am ready to admit is, the imputed assassination of\r\nhis young nephews; not only an unnatural crime, but sacrilege to that\r\ndivinity which was believed to hedge a king. The cotemporary ballad of\r\nthe 'Babes in the Wood,' was circulated by Buckingham to inflame the\r\nEnglish heart against one to whom he had thrown down the gauntlet for a\r\ndeadly wrestle. Except that the youngest babe is a girl, and that the\r\nuncle perishes in prison, the tragedy and the ballad wonderfully keep\r\npace together. In one, the prince's youth is put under charge of an\r\nuncle 'whom wealth and riches did surround;' in the other, 'the uncle is\r\na man of high estate.' The play soothes the deserted mother with,\r\n'Sister, have comfort;' the ballad with, 'Sweet sister, do not fear.'\r\nThe drama says that:\r\n\r\n  'Dighton and Forrest, though they were fleshed villains,\r\n  Wept like two children, in their death's sad story.'\r\n\r\nAnd the poem:\r\n\r\n  'He bargained with two ruffians strong,\r\n  Who were of furious mood.'\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n  'That the pretty speech they had,\r\n     Made murderous hearts relent,\r\n  And they that took to do the deed.\r\n     Full sore did now repent.'\r\n\r\nThere is a like agreement in their deaths:\r\n\r\n  'Thus, thus, quoth Dighton, girdling one another\r\n  Within their alabaster, innocent arms.'\r\n\r\nAnd the ballad:\r\n\r\n  'In one another's arms they died.'\r\n\r\nFinally, the greatest of English tragedies represents Richard's remorse\r\nas:\r\n\r\n  'My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,\r\n  And every tongue brings in a several tale,\r\n  And every tale condemns me for a villain.'\r\n\r\nWhile the most pathetic of English ballads gives it:\r\n\r\n  'And now the heavy wrath of God\r\n     Upon their uncle fell;\r\n  Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house.\r\n     His conscience felt a hell.'\r\n\r\nAs it is probable that this ballad was started on its rounds by\r\nBuckingham, the arch-plotter, was eagerly circulated by the Richmond\r\nconspirators, and sung all over the southern part of England as the\r\nfatal assault on Richard was about to be made, we shall hardly wonder\r\nthat, in an age of few books and no journals, the imputed crime hurled a\r\nusurper from his throne.\r\n\r\nBut was he really _guilty_? Did he deserve to be set up as this\r\nscarecrow in English story? The weight of authority says, 'Yes;' facts\r\nare coming to light in the indefatigable research now being made in\r\nEngland, which may yet say: 'No.'\r\n\r\nThe charge was started by the unprincipled Buckingham to excuse his\r\nsudden conversion from an accomplice, if Shakspeare is to be credited,\r\nto a bloodthirsty foe. It was so little received that, months afterward,\r\nthe convocation of British clergy addressed King Richard thus, 'Seeing\r\nyour most noble and blessed disposition in all other things'--so little\r\nreceived that when Richmond actually appeared in the field, there was no\r\npopular insurrection in his behalf, only a few nobles joined him with\r\ntheir own forces; and when their treason triumphed, and his rival sat\r\nsupreme on Richard's throne, the three pretended accomplices in the\r\nmurder of the princes were so far from punishment that their chief held\r\nhigh office for nearly a score of years, and then perished for assisting\r\nat the escape of Lady Suffolk, of the house of York. And when Perkin\r\nWarbeck appeared in arms as the murdered Prince Edward, and the\r\nstrongest possible motive urged Henry VII. to justify his usurpation by\r\nproducing the bones of the murdered princes, (which two centuries\r\nafterward were pretended to be found at the foot of the Tower-stairs,)\r\nat least to publish to the world the three murderers' confessions, and\r\ndemonstrate the absurdity of the popular insurrection, Lord Bacon\r\nhimself says, that Henry could obtain no proof, though he spared neither\r\nmoney nor effort! We have even the statement of Polydore Virgil, in a\r\nhistory written by express desire of Henry VII., that 'it was generally\r\nreported and believed that Edward's sons were still alive, having been\r\nconveyed secretly away, and obscurely concealed in some distant region.'\r\n\r\nAnd then the story is laden down with improbabilities. That Brakenbury\r\nshould have refused this service to so willful a despot, yet not have\r\nfled from the penalty of disobedience, and even have received additional\r\nroyal favors, and finally sacrificed his life, fighting bravely in\r\nbehalf of the bloodiest villain that ever went unhung, is a large pill\r\nfor credulity to swallow.\r\n\r\nAgain, that a mere page should have selected as chief butcher a nobleman\r\nhigh in office, knighted long before this in Scotland, and that this\r\nsame Sir Edward Tyrrel should have been continued in office around the\r\nmother of the murdered princes, and honored year after year with high\r\noffice by Henry VII., and actually made confidential governor of\r\nGuisnes, and royal commissioner for a treaty with France, seems\r\nperfectly incredible. All of Shakspeare's representation of this most\r\nslandered courtier is, indeed, utterly false; while Bacon's repetition\r\nof the principal charges only shows how impossible it is to recover a\r\nreputation that has once been lost, and how careless history has been in\r\nrepeating calumnies that have once found circulation.\r\n\r\nBayley's history of the Tower proves that what has been popularly\r\nchristened the Bloody Tower could never have been the scene of the\r\nsupposed murder; that no bones were found under any staircase there; so\r\nthat this pretended confirmation of the murder in the time of Charles\r\nII., on which many writers have relied, vanishes into the stuff which\r\ndreams are made of.\r\n\r\nAnd yet by this charge which the antiquarian Stowe declared was 'never\r\nproved by any credible witness,' which Grafton, Hall, and Holinshead\r\nagreed could never be certainly known; which Bacon declared that King\r\nHenry in vain endeavored to substantiate, a brave and politic monarch\r\nlost his crown, life, and historic fame! Nay, it is a curious fact that\r\nRichard could not safely contradict the report of the princes' deaths\r\nwhen it broke out with the outbreak of civil war, because it would have\r\nbeen furnishing to the rebellion a justifying cause and a royal head,\r\ninstead of a milksop whom he despised and felt certain to overthrow.\r\n\r\nAs it was, Richard left nothing undone to fortify his failing cause; he\r\nmay be thought even to have overdone. He doubled his spies, enlisted\r\nfresh troops, erected fortifications, equipped fleets, twice had\r\nRichmond at his fingers' ends, twice saw Providence take his side in the\r\ndispersion of Richmond's fleet, the overthrow of Buckingham's force;\r\nthen was utterly ruined by the general treason of his most trusted\r\nnobles and his not unnatural scorn of a pusillanimous rival. In vain did\r\nhe strive to be just and generous, vigilant and charitable, politic and\r\nenterprising. The poor excuse for Buckingham's desertion, the refusal of\r\nthe grant of Hereford, is refuted by a Harleian MS. recording that royal\r\nmunificence; yet Buckingham, without any question, wove the net in which\r\nthis lion fell; he seduced the very officers of the court; he invited\r\nRichmond over, assuring him of a popular uprising, which was proved to\r\nbe a mere mockery by the miserable handful that rallied around him,\r\nuntil Richard fell at Bosworth. And after Buckingham's death, Richmond\r\nmerely followed _his_ plans, used the tools he had prepared, headed the\r\nconspiracy which this unmitigated traitor arranged, and profited more\r\nthan Richard by his death, because he had not to fear an after-struggle\r\nwith Buckingham's insatiable ambition, overweening pride, and\r\nunsurpassed popular power.\r\n\r\nAs one becomes familiar with the cotemporary statements, the fall of\r\nRichard seems nothing but the treachery which provoked his last outcry\r\non the field of death. Even Catesby probably turned against him; his own\r\nAttorney-General invited the invaders into Wales with promise of aid;\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland, whom Richard had covered over with honor,\r\nheld his half of the army motionless while his royal benefactor was\r\nmurdered before his eyes. Stanley was a snake in the grass in the next\r\nreign as well as this, and at last expiated his double treason too late\r\nupon the scaffold. Yet while the nobles went over to Richmond's side,\r\nthe common people held back; only three thousand troops, perhaps\r\npersonal retainers of their lords, united themselves to the two thousand\r\nRichmond hired abroad. It was any thing but a popular uprising against\r\nthe jealous, hateful, bloody humpback of Shakspeare; it excuses the\r\nfatal precipitancy with which the King (instead of gathering his troops\r\nfrom the scattered fortifications) not only hurried on the battle, but,\r\nwhen the mine of treason began to explode beneath his feet on Bosworth\r\nfield, refused to seek safety by flight, but heading a furious charge\r\nupon Richmond, threw his life magnificently away.\r\n\r\nEven had he been guilty of the great crime which cost him his crown, his\r\nfate would have merited many a tear but for the unrivaled genius at\r\ndefamation with which the master-dramatist did homage to the triumphant\r\nhouse of Lancaster. Lord Orford says, that it is evident the Tudors\r\nretained all their Lancastrian prejudices even in the reign of\r\nElizabeth; and that Shakspeare's drama was patronized by her who liked\r\nto have her grandsire presented in so favorable a light as the deliverer\r\nof his native land from a bloody tyranny.\r\n\r\nEven in taking the darkest view of his case, we find that other English\r\nsovereigns had sinned the same: Henry I. probably murdered the elder\r\nbrother whom he robbed; Edward III. deposed his own father; Henry IV.\r\ncheated his nephew of the sceptre, and permitted his assassination;\r\nShakspeare's own Elizabeth was not over-sisterly to Mary of Scotland;\r\nall around Richard, robbery, treason, violence, lust, murder, were like\r\na swelling sea. Why was he thus singled out for the anathema of four\r\ncenturies? Why was the naked corpse of one who fell fighting valiantly,\r\nthrown rudely on a horse's back? Why was his stone coffin degraded into\r\na tavern-trough, and his remains tossed out no man knew where? Not\r\nmerely that the Plantagenets never lifted their heads from the gory dust\r\nany more, so that their conquerors wrote the epitaph upon their tombs,\r\nand hired the annalists of their fame; but, still more, that the weak\r\nand assailed Henry required every excuse for his invasion and\r\nusurpation; and that the principal nobility of England wanted a\r\nhiding-place for the shame of their violated oaths, their monstrous\r\nperfidy, their cowardly abandonment in the hour of peril of one of the\r\nbravest leaders, wisest statesmen, and most liberal princes England ever\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO IN THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the negro can or ought to be employed in the Federal army, or in\r\nany way, for the purpose of suppressing the present rebellion, is\r\nbecoming a question of very decided significance. It is a little late in\r\nthe day, to be sure, since it is probable that the expensive amusement\r\nof dirt-and-shovel warfare might, by the aid of the black, have been\r\nsomewhat shorn of its expense, and our Northern army have counted some\r\nthousands of lives more than it now does, had the contraband been freely\r\nencouraged to delve for his deliverance. Still, there are signs of sense\r\nbeing slowly manifested by the great conservative mass, and we every day\r\nsee proof that there are many who, to conquer the enemy, are willing to\r\ndo a bold or practical thing, even if it _does_ please the\r\nAbolitionists. Like the rustic youth who was informed of a sure way to\r\nobtain great wealth if he would pay a trifle, they would not mind\r\ngetting _that_ fortune if it _did_ cost a dollar. It _is_ a pity, of\r\ncourse, saith conservatism, that the South can not be conquered in some\r\npotent way which shall at least make it feel a little bad, and at the\r\nsame time utterly annihilate that rather respectably sized majority of\r\nAmericans who would gladly see emancipation realized. However, as the\r\npotent way is not known, we must do the best we can. In its secret\r\nconclaves, respectable conservatism shakes its fine old head, and\r\nsmoothing down the white cravat inherited from the late great and good\r\nBuchanan, admits that the _Richmond Whig_ is almost right, after\r\nall--this Federal cause _is_ very much in the nature of a 'servile\r\ninsurrection' of Northern serfs against gentlemen; '_mais que\r\nvoulez-vous?_--we have got into the wrong boat, and must sink or swim\r\nwith the maddened Helots! And conservatism sighs for the good old days\r\nwhen they blasphemed _Liberty_ at their little suppers,\r\n\r\n  'And--blest condition!-felt genteel.'\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the portraits of Puritan or Huguenot or Revolutionary\r\nancestors frowned on them from the walls--the portraits of men who had\r\nrisked all things for freedom; ''but this is a different state of\r\nthings, you know;' we have changed all that--the heart is on the other\r\nside of the body now--let us be discreet!'\r\n\r\nIt is curious, in this connection of employing slaves as workmen or\r\nsoldiers, with the remembrance of the progressive gentlemen of the olden\r\ntime who founded this republic, to see what the latter thought in their\r\nday of such aid in warfare. And fortunately we have at hand what we\r\nwant, in a very _multum in parvo_ pamphlet[5] by George H. Moore,\r\nLibrarian of the New-York Historical Society. From this we learn that\r\nwhile great opposition to the project prevailed, owing to wrong\r\njudgment as to the capacity of the black, the expediency and even\r\nnecessity of employing him was, during the events of the war, forcibly\r\ndemonstrated, and that, when he _was_ employed in a military capacity,\r\nhe proved himself a good soldier.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, great and good men during the Revolution, who\r\nwarmly sustained the affirmative. The famous Dr. Hopkins wrote as\r\nfollows in 1776:\r\n\r\n     'God is so ordering it in his providence, that it seems absolutely\r\n     necessary something should speedily be done with respect to the\r\n     slaves among us, in order to our safety, and to prevent their\r\n     turning against us in our present struggle, in order to get their\r\n     liberty. Our oppressors have planned to gain the blacks, and induce\r\n     them to take up arms against us, by promising them liberty on this\r\n     condition; and this plan they are prosecuting to the utmost of\r\n     their power, by which means they have persuaded numbers to join\r\n     them. And should we attempt to restrain them by force and severity,\r\n     keeping a strict guard over them, and punishing them severely who\r\n     shall be detected in attempting to join our opposers, this will\r\n     only be making bad worse, and serve to render our inconsistence,\r\n     oppression and cruelty more criminal, perspicuous and shocking, and\r\n     bring down the righteous vengeance of heaven on our heads. The only\r\n     way pointed out to prevent this threatening evil, is to set the\r\n     blacks at liberty ourselves by some public acts and laws, and then\r\n     give them proper encouragement to labor, or take arms in the\r\n     defense of the American cause, as they shall choose. This would at\r\n     once be doing them some degree of justice, and defeating our\r\n     enemies in the scheme they are prosecuting.'\r\n\r\n'These,' says Mr. Moore, 'were the views of a philanthropic divine, who\r\nurged them upon the Continental Congress and the owners of slaves\r\nthroughout the colonies with singular power, showing it to be at once\r\ntheir duty and their interest to adopt the policy of emancipation.' They\r\ndid not meet with those of the administration of any of the colonies,\r\nand were formally disapproved. But while the enlistment of negroes was\r\nprohibited, the fact is still notorious, as Bancroft says, that 'the\r\nroll of the army at Cambridge had from its first formation borne the\r\nnames of men of color.' 'Free negroes stood in the ranks by the side of\r\nwhite men. In the beginning of the war, they had entered the provincial\r\narmy; the first general order which was issued by Ward had required a\r\nreturn, among other things, of the 'complexion' of the soldiers; and\r\nblack men, like others, were retained in the service after the troops\r\nwere adopted by the continent.'\r\n\r\nIt was determined on, at war-councils and in committees of conference,\r\nin 1775, that negroes should be rejected from the enlistments; and yet\r\nGeneral Washington found, in that same year, that the negroes, if not\r\nemployed in the American army, would become formidable foes when\r\nenlisted by the enemy. We may judge, from a note given by Mr. Moore,\r\nthat Washington had at least a higher opinion than his _confrères_ of\r\nthe power of the black. His apprehensions, we are told, were grounded\r\nsomewhat on the operations of Lord Dunmore, whose proclamation had been\r\nissued declaring 'all indented servants, negroes or others,\r\n(appertaining to rebels,) free,' and calling on them to join his\r\nMajesty's troops. It was the opinion of the commander-in-chief, that if\r\nDunmore was not crushed before spring, he would become the most\r\nformidable enemy America had; 'his strength will increase as a snow-ball\r\nby rolling, and faster, if some expedient can not be hit upon to\r\nconvince the slaves and servants of the impotency of his designs.'\r\nConsequently, in general orders, December 30th, he says:\r\n\r\n     'As the General is informed that numbers of free negroes are\r\n     desirous of enlisting, he gives leave to the recruiting-officers to\r\n     entertain them, and promises to lay the matter before the Congress,\r\n     who, he doubts not, will approve of it.'\r\n\r\nWashington communicated his action to Congress, adding: 'If this is\r\ndisapproved of by Congress, I will put a stop to it.'\r\n\r\nHis letter was referred to a committee of three, (Mr. Wythe, Mr. Adams,\r\nand Mr. Wilson,) on the fifteenth of January, 1776, and upon their\r\nreport on the following day the Congress determined:\r\n\r\n     'That the free negroes who have served faithfully in the army at\r\n     Cambridge may be reënlisted therein, but no others.'\r\n\r\nThat Washington, at a later period at least, warmly approved of the\r\nemployment of blacks as soldiers, appears from his remarks to Colonel\r\nLaurens, subsequent to his failure to carry out what even as an effort\r\nforms one of the most remarkable episodes of the Revolution, full\r\ndetails of which are given in Mr. Moore's pamphlet.\r\n\r\nOn March 14th, 1779, Alexander Hamilton wrote to John Jay, then\r\nPresident of Congress, warmly commending a plan of Colonel Laurens, the\r\nobject of which was to raise three or four battalions of negroes in\r\nSouth-Carolina. We regret that our limits render it impossible to give\r\nthe whole of this remarkable document, which is as applicable to the\r\npresent day as it was to its own.\r\n\r\n     'I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition\r\n     from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught\r\n     to entertain for the blacks makes us fancy many things that are\r\n     founded neither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to\r\n     part with property of so valuable a kind will furnish a thousand\r\n     arguments to show the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of\r\n     a scheme which requires such sacrifices. But it should be\r\n     considered that if we do not make use of them in this way, the\r\n     enemy probably will; and that the best way to counteract the\r\n     temptations they will hold out, will be to offer them ourselves. An\r\n     essential part of the plan is to give them their freedom with their\r\n     swords. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage,\r\n     and, I believe, will have a good influence upon those who remain,\r\n     by opening a door to their emancipation.\r\n\r\n     'This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me\r\n     to wish the success of the project; for the dictates of humanity\r\n     and true policy equally interest me in favor of this unfortunate\r\n     class of men.\r\n\r\n     'While I am on the subject of Southern affairs, you will excuse the\r\n     liberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently\r\n     vigorous are pursuing for our defense in that quarter. Except the\r\n     few regular troops of South-Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly\r\n     on the militia of that and two neighboring States. These will soon\r\n     grow impatient of service, and leave our affairs in a miserable\r\n     situation. No considerable force can be uniformly kept up by\r\n     militia, to say nothing of the many obvious and well-known\r\n     inconveniences that attend this kind of troops. I would beg leave\r\n     to suggest, sir, that no time ought to be lost in making a draft of\r\n     militia to serve a twelve-month, from the States of North and\r\n     South-Carolina and Virginia. But South-Carolina, being very weak in\r\n     her population of whites, may be excused from the draft, on\r\n     condition of furnishing the black battalions. The two others may\r\n     furnish about three thousand five hundred men, and be exempted, on\r\n     that account, from sending any succors to this army. The States to\r\n     the northward of Virginia will be fully able to give competent\r\n     supplies to the army here; and it will require all the force and\r\n     exertions of the three States I have mentioned to withstand the\r\n     storm which has arisen, and is increasing in the South.\r\n\r\n     'The troops drafted must be thrown into battalions, and officered\r\n     in the best possible manner. The best supernumerary officers may be\r\n     made use of as far as they will go. If arms are wanted for their\r\n     troops, and no better way of supplying them is to be found, we\r\n     should endeavor to levy a contribution of arms upon the militia at\r\n     large. Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear\r\n     this Southern business will become a very _grave_ one.\r\n\r\n        'With the truest respect and esteem,\r\n             I am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n     'His Excellency, JOHN JAY,\r\n     President of Congress,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project was warmly approved by Major-General Greene, and Laurens\r\nhimself, who proposed to lead the blacks, was enthusiastic in his hopes.\r\nIn a letter written about this time, he says:\r\n\r\n     'It appears to me that I should be inexcusable in the light of a\r\n     citizen, if I did not continue my utmost efforts for carrying the\r\n     plan of the black levies into execution, while there remains the\r\n     smallest hope of success. The House of Representatives will be\r\n     convened in a few days. I intend to qualify, and make a final\r\n     effort. Oh! that I were a Demosthenes! The Athenians never deserved\r\n     a more bitter exprobation than our countrymen.'\r\n\r\nBut the Legislature of South-Carolina decided, as might have been\r\nexpected from the most tory of States in the Revolution, as it now is\r\nthe most traitorous in the Emancipation--for it is by _that_ name that\r\nthis war will be known in history. It rejected Laurens' proposal--his\r\nown words give the best account of the failure:\r\n\r\n     'I was outvoted, having only reason on my side, and being opposed\r\n     by a triple-headed monster, that shod the baneful influence of\r\n     avarice, prejudice, and pusillanimity in all our assemblies. It was\r\n     some consolation to me, however, to find that philosophy and truth\r\n     had made some little progress since my last effort, as I obtained\r\n     twice as many suffrages as before.'\r\n\r\n'Washington,' says Mr. Moore, 'comforted Laurens with the confession\r\nthat he was not at all astonished by the failure of the plan, adding:\r\n\r\n     ''That spirit of freedom, which at the commencement of this contest\r\n     would have gladly sacrificed every thing to the attainment of its\r\n     object, has long since subsided, and every selfish passion has\r\n     taken its place. It is not the public, but private interest, which\r\n     influences the generality of mankind, nor can the Americans any\r\n     longer boast an exception. Under these circumstances, it would\r\n     rather have been surprising if you had succeeded.'\r\n\r\nBut the real lesson which this rejection of negro aid taught this\r\ncountry was a bitter one. South-Carolina lost twenty-five thousand\r\nnegroes, and in Georgia between three fourths and seven eighths of the\r\nslaves escaped. The British organized them, made great use of them, and\r\nthey became 'dangerous and well-disciplined bands of marauders.' As the\r\nwant of recruits in the American army increased, negroes, both bond and\r\nfree, were finally and gladly taken. In the department under General\r\nWashington's command, on August 24th, 1778, there were nearly eight\r\nhundred black soldiers. This does not include, however, the black\r\nregiment of Rhode Island slaves which had just been organized.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 General Varnum proposed to Washington that a battalion of negro\r\nslaves be raised, to be commanded by Colonel Greene, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nOlney, and Major Ward. Washington approved of the plan, which, however,\r\nmet with strong opposition from the Rhode Island Assembly. The black\r\nregiment was, however, raised, tried, 'and not found wanting.' As Mr.\r\nMoore declares:\r\n\r\n     'In the battle of Rhode-Island, August 29th, 1778, said by\r\n     Lafayette to have been 'the best fought action of the whole war,'\r\n     this newly raised black regiment, under Colonel Greene,\r\n     distinguished itself by deeds of desperate valor, repelling three\r\n     times the fierce assaults of an overwhelming force of Hessian\r\n     troops. And so they continued to discharge their duty with zeal and\r\n     fidelity--never losing any of their first laurels so gallantly won.\r\n     It is not improbable that Colonel John Laurens witnessed and drew\r\n     some of his inspiration from the scene of their first trial in the\r\n     field.'\r\n\r\nA company of negroes from Connecticut was also raised and commanded by\r\nthe late General Humphreys, who was attached to the family of\r\nWashington. Of this company cotemporary account says that they\r\n'conducted themselves with fidelity and efficiency throughout the war.'\r\nSo, little by little, the negro came to be an effective aid, after all\r\nthe formal rejections of his service. In 1780, an act was passed in\r\nMaryland to procure one thousand men to serve three years. The property\r\nin the State was divided into classes of sixteen thousand pounds, each\r\nof which was, within twenty days, to furnish one recruit, who might be\r\neither a freeman or a slave. In 1781, the Legislature resolved to raise,\r\nimmediately, seven hundred and fifty negroes, to be incorporated with\r\nthe other troops.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia an act had been passed in 1777, declaring that free negroes,\r\nand free negroes only, might be enlisted on the footing with white men.\r\nGreat numbers of Virginians who wished to escape military service,\r\ncaused their slaves to enlist, having tendered them to the\r\nrecruiting-officers as substitutes for free persons, whose lot or duty\r\nit was to serve in the army, at the same time representing that these\r\nslaves were freemen. 'On the expiration of the term of enlistment, the\r\nformer owners attempted to force them to return to a state of\r\nservitude, with equal disregard of the principles of justice and their\r\nown solemn promise.'\r\n\r\nThe iniquity of such proceedings soon raised a storm of indignation, and\r\nthe result was the passage of an Act of Emancipation, securing freedom\r\nto all slaves who had served their term in the war.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal facts collected in this remarkable and timely\r\npublication. It is needless to say that we commend it to the careful\r\nperusal of all who desire conclusive information on a most important\r\nsubject. It is evident that we are going through nearly the same stages\r\nof timidity, ignorance, and blind conservatism which were passed by our\r\nforefathers, and shall come, if not too late, upon the same results. It\r\nis historically true that Washington apparently had in the beginning\r\nthese scruples, but was among the first to lay them aside, and that\r\nexperience taught him and many others the folly of scrupling to employ\r\nin regular warfare and in a regular way men who would otherwise aid the\r\nenemy.

Buttoning my outside coat\r\nclosely about me--for it was a cold, stormy night in November--I\r\ndescended the steps of the Astor House to visit, in the upper part of\r\nthe city, the blue-eyed young woman who is looking over my shoulder\r\nwhile I write this--it was nearly twenty years ago, reader, but she is\r\nyoung yet!\r\n\r\nAs I closed the outer door, a small voice at my elbow, in a tone broken\r\nby sobs, said:\r\n\r\n'Sir--will you--please, sir--will you buy some ballads?'\r\n\r\n'Ballads! a little fellow like you selling ballads at this time of\r\nnight?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir! I haven't sold only three all day, sir; do, please sir, _do_\r\nbuy some!' and as he stood under the one gas-burner which lit the\r\nhotel-porch, I saw that his eyes were red with weeping.\r\n\r\n'Come inside, my little man; don't stand here in the cold. Who sends you\r\nout on such a night as this to sell ballads?'\r\n\r\n'Nobody, sir; but mother is sick, and I _have_ to sell 'em! She's had\r\nnothing to eat all day, sir. Oh! do buy some--_do_ buy some, sir!'\r\n\r\n'I will, my good boy; but tell me, have you no father?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir, I never had any--and mother is sick, _very_ sick, sir; and\r\nshe's nobody to do any thing for her but _me_--nobody but _me_, sir!'\r\nand he cried as if his very heart would break.\r\n\r\n'Don't cry, my little boy, don't cry; I'll buy your ballads--all of\r\nthem;' and I gave him two half-dollar pieces--all the silver I had.\r\n\r\n'I haven't got so many as that, sir; I haven't got only twenty, and\r\nthey're only a cent a piece, sir;' and with very evident reluctance, he\r\ntendered me back the money.\r\n\r\n'Oh! never mind, my boy, keep the money and the ballads too.'\r\n\r\n'O sir! thank you. Mother will be so glad, _so_ glad, sir!' and he\r\nturned to go, but his feelings overpowering him, he hid his little face\r\nin the big blanket-shawl which he wore, and sobbed louder and harder\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n'Where does your mother live, my boy?'\r\n\r\n'Round in Anthony street, sir; some good folks there give her a room,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'Did you say she was sick?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, very sick; the doctor says she can't live only a little\r\nwhile, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And what will become of you, when she is dead?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know, sir. Mother says God will take care of me, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Come, my little fellow, don't cry any more; I'll go with you and see\r\nyour mother.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! thank you, sir; mother will be so glad to have you--so glad to\r\nthank you, sir;' and, looking up timidly an my face, he added: 'You'll\r\n_love_ mother, sir!'\r\n\r\nI took his hand in mine, and we went out into the storm.\r\n\r\nHe was not more than six years old, and had a bright, intelligent, but\r\npale and peaked face. He wore thin, patched trowsers, a small, ragged\r\ncap, and large, tattered boots, and over his shoulders was a worn woolen\r\nshawl. I could not see the remainder of his clothing, but I afterward\r\ndiscovered that a man's waistcoat was his only other garment.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, it was a bleak, stormy night. The rain, which had fallen\r\nall the day, froze as it fell, and the sharp, wintry wind swept down\r\nBroadway, sending an icy chill to my very bones, and making the little\r\nhand I held in mine tremble with cold. We passed several blocks in\r\nsilence, when the child turned into a side-street.\r\n\r\n'My little fellow,' I said, 'this is not Anthony street--that is further\r\non.'\r\n\r\n'I know it, sir; but I want to get mother some bread, sir. A good\r\ngentleman down here sells to me very cheap, sir.'\r\n\r\nWe crossed a couple of streets and stopped at a corner-grocery.\r\n\r\n'Why, my little 'un,' said the large, red-faced man behind the counter,\r\n'I didn't know what had become of ye! Why haven't ye bin here to-day?'\r\n\r\n'I hadn't any money, sir,' replied the little boy.\r\n\r\n'An' haven't ye had any bread to-day, sonny?'\r\n\r\n'Mother hasn't had any, sir; a little bit was left last night, but she\r\nmade _me_ eat that, sir.'\r\n\r\n'D--n it, an' hasn't _she_ hed any all day! Ye mustn't do that agin,\r\nsonny; ye must come whether ye've money or no; times is hard, but, I\r\nswear, I kin give _ye_ a loaf any time.'\r\n\r\n'I thank you, sir,' I said, advancing from the doorway where I had stood\r\nunobserved--'I will pay you;' and taking a roll of bills from my pocket,\r\nI gave him one. 'You know what they want--send it to them at once.'\r\n\r\nThe man stared at me a moment in amazement, then said:\r\n\r\n'An' do ye know 'em, sir?'\r\n\r\n'No, I'm just going there.'\r\n\r\n'Well, do, sir; they're bad off; ye kin do real good there, no mistake.'\r\n\r\n'I'll see,' I replied; and taking the bread in one hand and the little\r\nboy by the other, I started again for his mother's. I was always a rapid\r\nwalker, but I had difficulty in keeping up with the little fellow as he\r\ntrotted along at my side.\r\n\r\nWe soon stopped at the door of an old, weather-worn building, which I\r\nsaw by the light of the street-lamp was of dingy brick, three stories\r\nhigh, and hermetically sealed by green board-shutters. It sat but one\r\nstep above the ground, and a dim light which came through the low\r\nbasement-windows, showed that even its cellar was occupied. My little\r\nguide rang the bell, and in a moment a panel of the door opened, and a\r\nshrill voice asked:\r\n\r\n'Who's there?'\r\n\r\n'It's only me, ma'am; please let me in.'\r\n\r\n'What, _you_, Franky, out so late as this!' exclaimed the woman, undoing\r\nthe chain which held the door. As she was about closing it she caught\r\nsight of me, and eyeing me for a moment, said: 'Walk in, sir.' As I\r\ncomplied with the invitation, she added, pointing to a room opening from\r\nthe hall: 'Step in there, sir.'\r\n\r\n'He's come to see mother, ma'am,' said the little boy.\r\n\r\n'You can't see _her_, sir, she's sick, and don't see company any more.'\r\n\r\n'I would see her for only a moment, madam.'\r\n\r\n'But she can't see nobody now, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! mother would like to see him very much, ma'am; he's a very good\r\ngentleman, ma'am,' said the child, in a pleading, winning tone.\r\n\r\nThe real object of my visit seemed to break upon the woman, for, making\r\na low courtesy, she said:\r\n\r\n'Oh! she _will_ be glad to see you, sir; she's very bad off, very bad\r\nindeed;' and she at once led the way to the basement stairway.\r\n\r\nThe woman was about forty, with a round, full form, a red, bloated face,\r\nand eyes which looked as if they had not known a wink of sleep for\r\nyears. She wore a dirty lace-cap, trimmed with gaudy colors, and a\r\ntawdry red and black dress, laid off in large squares like the map of\r\nPhiladelphia. It was very low in the neck--remarkably so for the\r\nseason--and disclosed a scorched, florid skin, and a rough, mountainous\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nThe furnishings of the hall had a shabby-genteel look, till we reached\r\nthe basement stairs, when every thing became bare, and dark, and dirty.\r\nThe woman led the way down, and opened the door of a front-room--the\r\nonly one on the floor, the rest of the space being open, and occupied as\r\na cellar. This room had a forlorn, cheerless appearance. Its front wall\r\nwas of the naked brick, through which the moisture had crept, dotting it\r\nevery here and there with large water-stains and blotches of mold. Its\r\nother sides were of rough boards, placed upright, and partially covered\r\nwith a dirty, ragged paper. The floor was of wide, unpainted plank. A\r\nhuge chimney-stack protruded some three feet into the room, and in it\r\nwas a hole which admitted the pipe of a rusty air-tight stove that gave\r\nout just enough heat to take the chill edge off the damp, heavy\r\natmosphere. This stove, a small stand resting against the wall, a\r\nbroken-backed chair, and a low, narrow bed covered with a ragged\r\npatch-work counterpane, were the only furniture of the apartment. And\r\nthat room was the home of two human beings.\r\n\r\n'How do you feel to-night, Fanny?' asked the woman, as she approached\r\nthe low bed in the corner. There was a reply, but it was too faint for\r\nme to hear.\r\n\r\n'Here, mamma,' said the little boy, taking me by the hand and leading me\r\nto the bedside, 'here's a good gentleman who's come to see you. He's\r\n_very_ good, mamma; he's given me a whole dollar, and got you lots of\r\nthings at the store; oh! lots of things!' and the little fellow threw\r\nhis arms around his mother's neck, and kissed her again and again in his\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nThe mother turned her eye upon me--such an eye! It seemed a black flame.\r\nAnd her face--so pale, so wan, so woe-begone, and yet so sweetly,\r\nstrangely, beautiful--seemed that of some fallen angel, who, after long\r\nages of torment, had been purified, and fitted again for heaven! And it\r\nwas so. She had suffered all the woe, she had wept for all the sin, and\r\nthen she stood white and pure before the everlasting gates which were\r\nopening to let her in!\r\n\r\nShe reached me her thin, weak hand, and in a low voice, said: 'I thank\r\nyou, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You are welcome, madam. You are very sick; it hurts you to speak?'\r\n\r\nShe nodded slightly, but said nothing. I turned to the woman who had\r\nadmitted me, and in a very low tone said: 'I never saw a person die; is\r\nshe not dying?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir, I guess not. She's seemed so for a good many days.'\r\n\r\n'Has she had a physician?'\r\n\r\n'Not for nigh a month. A doctor come once or twice, but he said it wan't\r\nno use--he couldn't help her.'\r\n\r\n'But she should have help at once. Have you any one you can send?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes; I kin manage that. What doctor will you have?'\r\n\r\nI wrote on a piece of paper the name of an acquaintance--a skillful and\r\nexperienced physician, who lived not far off--and gave it to her.\r\n\r\n'And can't you make her a cup of tea, and a little chicken-broth? She\r\nhas had nothing all day.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing all day! I'm sure I didn't know it! I'm poor, sir--you don't\r\nknow how poor--but she shan't starve in my house.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose she didn't like to speak of it; but get her something as soon\r\nas you can.'\r\n\r\n'I will, sir; I'll fix her some tea and broth right off.'\r\n\r\n'Well, do, as quick as possible. I'll pay you for your trouble.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want any pay, sir,' she replied, as she turned and darted from\r\nthe doorway as nimbly as if she had not been fat and forty.\r\n\r\nShe soon returned with the tea, and I gave it to the sick girl, a\r\nspoonful at a time, she being too weak to sit up. It was the first she\r\nhad tasted for weeks, and it greatly revived her.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the doctor came. He felt her pulse, asked, her a few\r\nquestions in a low voice, and then wrote some simple directions. When he\r\nhad done that, he turned to me and said: 'Step outside for a moment; I\r\nwant to speak with you.'\r\n\r\nAs we passed out, we met the woman going in with the broth.\r\n\r\n'Please give it to her at once,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, I will; but, gentlemen, don't stand here in the cold. Walk up\r\ninto the parlor--the front-room.'\r\n\r\nWe did as she suggested, for the cellar-way had a damp, unhealthy air.\r\n\r\nThe parlor was furnished in a showy, tawdry style, and a worn, ugly,\r\nflame-colored carpet covered its floor. A coal-fire was burning in the\r\ngrate, and we sat down by it. As we did so, I heard loud voices, mingled\r\nwith laughter and the clinking of glasses, in the adjoining room. Not\r\nappearing to notice the noises, the doctor asked:\r\n\r\n'Who is this woman?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know; I never saw her before. Is she dying?'\r\n\r\n'No, not now. But she can't last long; a week, at the most.'\r\n\r\n'She evidently has the consumption. That damp cellar has killed her; she\r\nshould be got out of it.'\r\n\r\n'The cellar hasn't done it; her very vitals are eaten up. She's been\r\nbeyond cure for six months!'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible? And such a woman!'\r\n\r\n'Oh! I see such cases every day--women as fine-looking as she is.'\r\n\r\nA ring came at the front-door, and in a moment I heard the woman coming\r\nup the basement stairs. I had risen when the doctor made the last\r\nremark, and was pacing up and down the room, deliberating on what should\r\nbe done. The parlor-door was ajar, and as the woman admitted the\r\nnew-comers, I caught a glimpse of them. They were three rough,\r\nhard-looking characters; and one, from his unsteady gait, I judged to be\r\nintoxicated. She seemed glad to see them, and led them into the room\r\nfrom whence the noises proceeded. In a moment the doctor rose to go,\r\nsaying: 'I can do nothing more. But what do you intend to do here? I\r\nbrought you out to ask you.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what _can_ be done. She ought not to be left to die\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\n'She'd prefer dying above-ground, no doubt; and if you relish fleecing,\r\nyou'll get her an upper room--but she's got to die soon any way, and a\r\nday or two, more or less, down there, won't make any difference. Take my\r\nadvice--don't throw your money away, and don't stay here too late; the\r\nhouse has a very hard name, and some of its rough customers would think\r\nnothing of throttling a spruce young fellow like you.'\r\n\r\n'I thank you, doctor, but I think I'll run the risk--at least for a\r\nwhile,' and I laughed good-humoredly at the benevolent gentleman's\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\n'Well, if you lose your small change, don't charge it to me.' Saying\r\nthis, he bade me 'good-night.'\r\n\r\nHe found the door locked, barred, and secured by the large chain, and he\r\nwas obliged to summon the woman. When she had let him out, I asked her\r\ninto the parlor.\r\n\r\n'Who is this sick person?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'I don't know, sir. She never gave me no name but Fanny. I found her and\r\nher little boy on the door-step, one night, nigh a month ago. She was\r\ncrying hard, and seemed very sick, and little Franky was a-trying to\r\ncomfort her--he's a brave, noble little fellow, sir. She told me she'd\r\nbeen turned out of doors for not paying her rent, and was afeared she'd\r\ndie in the street, though she didn't seem to care much about that,\r\nexcept for the boy--she took on terrible about him. She didn't know what\r\n_would_ become of him. I've to scrape very hard to get along, sir, for\r\ntimes is hard, and my rent is a thousand dollars; but I couldn't see her\r\ndie there, so I took her in, and put a bed up in the basement, and let\r\nher have it. 'Twas all I could do; but, poor thing! she won't want even\r\nthat long.'\r\n\r\n'It was very good of you. How has she obtained food?'\r\n\r\n'The little boy sells papers and ballads about the streets. The newsman\r\nround the corner trusts him for 'em, and he's managed to make\r\ntwenty-five cents or more most every day.'\r\n\r\n'Can't you give her another room? She should not die where she is.'\r\n\r\n'I know she shouldn't, sir, but I hain't got another--all of 'em is\r\ntaken up; and besides, sir,' and she hesitated a moment, 'the noise up\r\nhere would disturb her.'\r\n\r\nI had not thought of that; and expressing myself gratified with her\r\nkindness, I passed down again to the basement. The sick girl smiled as I\r\nopened the door, and held out her hand again to me. Taking it in mine, I\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n'Do you feel better?'\r\n\r\n'Much better,' she said, in a voice stronger than before. 'I have not\r\nfelt so well for a long time. I owe it to you, sir! I am very grateful.'\r\n\r\n'Don't speak of it, madam. Won't you have more of the broth?'\r\n\r\n'No more, thank you. I won't trouble you any more, sir--I shan't trouble\r\nany one long;' and her eyes filled, and her voice quivered; 'but, O sir!\r\nmy child! my little boy! What _will_ become of him when I'm gone?' and\r\nshe burst into a hysterical fit of weeping.\r\n\r\n'Don't weep so, madam. Calm yourself; such excitement will kill you. God\r\nwill provide for your child. I will try to help him, madam.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with those deep, intense eyes. A new light seemed to\r\ncome into them; it overspread her face, and lit up her thin, wan\r\nfeatures with a strange glow.\r\n\r\n'It must be so,' she said, 'else why were you led here? God must have\r\nsent you to me for that!'\r\n\r\n'No doubt he did, madam. Let it comfort you to think so.'\r\n\r\n'It does, oh! it does. And, O my Father!' and she looked up to Him as\r\nshe spoke: 'I thank thee! Thy poor, sinful, dying child thanks thee;\r\nand, oh! bless _him_, forever bless him, for it!'\r\n\r\nI turned away to hide the emotion I could not repress. A moment after,\r\nnot seeing the little boy, I asked:\r\n\r\n'Where is your son?'\r\n\r\n'Here, sir.' And turning down the bed-clothing, she showed him sleeping\r\nquietly by her side, all unconscious of the misery and the sin around\r\nhim, and of the mighty crisis through which his young life was passing.\r\n\r\nSaying I would return on the following day, I shortly afterward bade her\r\n'good-night,' and left the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIt was noon on the following day when I again visited the house in\r\nAnthony street. As I opened the door of the sick woman's room, I was\r\nstartled by her altered appearance. Her eye had a strange, wild light,\r\nand her face already wore the pallid hue of death. She was bolstered up\r\nin bed, and the little boy was standing by her side, weeping, his arms\r\nabout her neck. I took her hand in mine, and in a voice which plainly\r\nspoke my fears, said:\r\n\r\n'You are worse!'\r\n\r\nIn broken gasps, and in a low, a very low tone, her lips scarcely\r\nmoving, she answered:\r\n\r\n'No! I am--better--much--better. I knew you--were coming. She told me\r\nso.'\r\n\r\n'_Who_ told you so?' I asked, very kindly, for I saw that her mind was\r\nwandering.\r\n\r\n'My mother--she has been with me--all the day--and I have been so--so\r\nhappy, so--_very_ happy! I am going now--going with her--I've only\r\nwaited--for you!'\r\n\r\n'Say no more now, madam, say no more; you are too weak to talk.'\r\n\r\n'But I _must_ talk. I am--dying, and I must tell--you all before--I go!'\r\n\r\n'I would gladly hear you, but you have not strength for it now. Let me\r\nget something to revive you.'\r\n\r\nShe nodded assent, and looking at her son, said:\r\n\r\n'Take Franky.'\r\n\r\nThe little boy kissed her, and followed me from the room. When we had\r\nreached the upper-landing, I summoned the woman of the house, and said\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n'Now, Franky, I want you to stay a little while with this good lady;\r\nyour mother would talk with me.'\r\n\r\n'But mother says she's dying, sir,' cried the little fellow, clinging\r\nclosely to me; 'I don't want her to die, sir. Oh! I want to be with her,\r\nsir!'\r\n\r\n'You shall be, very soon, my boy; your _mother_ wants you to stay with\r\nthis lady now.'\r\n\r\nHe released his hold on my coat, and sobbing violently, went with the\r\nred-faced woman. I hurried back from the apothecary's, and seating\r\nmyself on the one rickety chair by her bedside, gave the sick woman the\r\nrestorative. She soon revived, and then, in broken sentences, and in a\r\nlow, weak voice, pausing every now and then to rest or to weep, she told\r\nme her story. Weaving into it some details which I gathered from others\r\nafter her death, I give it to the reader as she outlined it to me.\r\n\r\nShe was the only daughter of a well-to-do farmer in the town of B----,\r\nNew-Hampshire. Her mother died when she was a child, and left her to the\r\ncare of a paternal aunt, who became her father's housekeeper. This aunt,\r\nlike her father, was of a cold, hard nature, and had no love for\r\nchildren. She was, however, an exemplary, pious woman. She denied\r\nherself every luxury, and would sit up late of nights to braid straw and\r\nknit socks, that she might send tracts and hymn-books to the poor\r\nheathen; but she never gave a word of sympathy, or a look of love to the\r\nyoung being that was growing up by her side. The little girl needed\r\nkindness and affection, as much as plants need the sun; but the good\r\naunt had not these to give her. When the child was six years old, she\r\nwas sent to the district-school. There she met a little boy not quite\r\nfive years her senior, and they soon became warm friends. He was a\r\nbrave, manly lad, and she thought no one was ever so good, or so\r\nhandsome as he. Her young heart found in him what it craved for--some\r\none to lean on and to love, and she loved him with all the strength of\r\nher child-nature. He was very kind to her. Though his home was a mile\r\naway, he came every morning to take her to school, and in the long\r\nsummer vacations he almost lived at her father's house. And thus four\r\nyears flew away--flew as fast as years that are winged with youth and\r\nlove always fly--and though her father was harsh, and her aunt cold and\r\nstern, she did not know a grief, or shed a tear in all that time.\r\n\r\nOne day, late in summer, toward the close of those four years,\r\nJohn--that was his name--came to her, his face beaming all over with\r\njoy, and said:\r\n\r\n'O Fanny! I am going--going to Boston. Father [he was a richer man than\r\nher father] has got me into a great store there--a great store, and I'm\r\nto stay till I'm twenty-one--they won't pay me hardly any thing--only\r\nfifty dollars the first year, and twenty-five more every other year--but\r\nfather says it's a great store, and it'll be the making of me.' And he\r\ndanced and sung for joy, but she wept in bitter grief.\r\n\r\nWell, five more years rolled away--this time they were not winged as\r\nbefore--and John came home to spend his two weeks of summer vacation. He\r\nhad come every year, but then he said to her what he had never said\r\nbefore--that which a woman never forgets. He told her that the old\r\nQuaker gentleman, the head of the great house he was with, had taken a\r\nfancy to him, and was going to send him to Europe, in the place of the\r\njunior partner, who was sick, and might never get well. That he should\r\nstay away a year, but when he came back, he was sure the old fellow\r\nwould make him a partner, and then--and he strained her to his heart as\r\nhe said it--'then I will make you my little wife, Fanny, and take you to\r\nBoston, and you shall be a fine lady--as fine a lady as Kate Russell,\r\nthe old man's daughter.' And again he danced and sung, and again she\r\nwept, but this time it was for joy.\r\n\r\nHe staid away a little more than a year, and when he returned he did not\r\ncome at once to her, but he wrote that he would very soon. In a few days\r\nhe sent her a newspaper, in which was a marked notice, which read\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n     'The co-partnership heretofore existing under the name and style of\r\n     RUSSELL, ROLLINS & Co., has been dissolved by the death of\r\n     DAVID GRAY, Jr.\r\n\r\n     'The outstanding affairs will be settled, and the business\r\n     continued, by the surviving partners, who have this day admitted\r\n     Mr. JOHN HALLET to an interest in their firm.'\r\n\r\nThe truth had been gradually dawning upon me, yet when she mentioned his\r\nname, I sprang involuntarily to my feet, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n'John Hallet! and were _you_ betrothed to _him_?'\r\n\r\nThe sick woman had paused from exhaustion, but when I said that, she\r\nmade a feeble effort to raise herself, and said in a stronger voice than\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n'Do you know him--sir?'\r\n\r\n'Know him! Yes, madam;' and I paused and spoke in a lower tone, for I\r\nsaw that my manner was unduly exciting her; 'I know him well.'\r\n\r\nI did know him _well_, and it was on the evening of the day that notice\r\nwas written, and just one month after David had followed his only son to\r\nthe grave, that I, a boy of sixteen, with my hat in my hand, entered the\r\ninner office of the old counting-room to which I have already introduced\r\nthe reader. Mr. Russell, a genial, gentle, good old man, was seated at\r\nhis desk, writing; and Mr. Rollins sat at his, poring over some long\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Russell and Mr. Rollins,' I said very respectfully, 'I have come to\r\nbid you good-by. I am going to leave you.'\r\n\r\n'Thee going to leave!' exclaimed Mr. Russell, laying down his\r\nspectacles; 'what does thee mean, Edmund?'\r\n\r\n'I mean, I don't want to stay any longer, sir,' I replied, my voice\r\ntrembling with emotion.\r\n\r\n'But you must stay, Edmund,' said Mr. Rollins, in his harsh, imperative\r\nway. 'Your uncle indentured you to us till you are twenty-one, and you\r\ncan't go.'\r\n\r\n'I _shall_ go, sir,' I replied, with less respect than he deserved. 'My\r\nuncle indentured me to the old firm; I am not bound to stay with the\r\nnew.'\r\n\r\nMr. Russell looked grieved, but in the same mild tone as before, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I am sorry, Edmund, very sorry, to hear thee say that. Thee can go if\r\nthee likes; but it grieves me to hear thee quibble so. Thee will not\r\nprosper, my son, if thee follows this course in life.' And the moisture\r\ncame into the old man's eyes as he spoke. It filled mine, and rolled in\r\nlarge drops down my cheeks, as I replied:\r\n\r\n'Forgive me, sir, for speaking so. I do not want to do wrong, but I\r\n_can't_ stay with John Hallet.'\r\n\r\n'Why can't thee stay with John?'\r\n\r\n'He don't like me, sir. We are not friends.'\r\n\r\n'Why are you not friends?'\r\n\r\n'Because I know him, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What do you know of him?' asked Mr. Rollins, in the same harsh, abrupt\r\ntone. I had never liked Mr. Rollins, and his words just then stung me to\r\nthe quick, I forgot myself, for I replied:\r\n\r\n'I know him to be a lying, deceitful, hypocritical scoundrel, sir.'\r\n\r\nSome two years before, Hallet had joined the church in which Mr. Rollins\r\nwas a deacon, and was universally regarded as a pious, devout young man.\r\nThe opinion I expressed was, therefore, rank heterodoxy. To my surprise,\r\nMr. Rollins turned to Mr. Russell and said:\r\n\r\n'I believe the boy is right, Ephraim; John professes too much to be\r\nentirely sincere; I've told you so before.'\r\n\r\n'I can't think so, Thomas; but it's too late to alter things now. We\r\nshall see. Time will prove him.'\r\n\r\nI soon left, but not till they had shaken me warmly by the hand, wished\r\nme well, and tendered me their aid whenever I required it. In\r\nafter-years they kept their word.\r\n\r\nYes, I did know John Hallet. The old gentleman never knew him, but time\r\nproved him, and those whom that good old man loved with all the love of\r\nhis large, noble heart, suffered because he did not know him as I did.\r\n\r\nAfter I had given her some of the cordial, and she had rested awhile,\r\nthe sick girl resumed her story.\r\n\r\nIn about a month Hallet came. He pictured to her his new position; the\r\nwealth and standing it would give him, and he told her that he was\r\npreparing a little home for her, and would soon return and take her with\r\nhim forever.\r\n\r\n[When he said that, he had been for over a year affianced to another--a\r\nrich man's only child--a woman older than he, whose shriveled, jaundiced\r\nface, weak, scrawny body, and puny, sickly soul, would have been\r\nrepulsive even to him, had not money been his god.]\r\n\r\nThe simple, trusting girl believed him. He importuned her--she loved\r\nhim--and she fell!\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterward, taking up a Boston paper, she read the marriage\r\nof Mr. John Hallet, merchant, to Miss ----. 'Some other person has\r\nhis name,' she thought. 'It can not be he, yet it is strange!' It _was_\r\nstrange, but it was _true_, for there, in another column, she saw that:\r\n'Mr. John Hallet, of the house of Russell, Rollins & Co., and his\r\naccomplished lady, were passengers by the steamer Cambria, which sailed\r\nfrom this port yesterday for Liverpool.'\r\n\r\nThe blow crushed her. But why need I tell of her grief, her agony, her\r\ndespair? For months she did not leave her room; and when at last she\r\ncrawled into the open air, the nearest neighbors scarcely recognized\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was long, however, before she knew all the wrong that Hallet had done\r\nher. Her aunt noticed her altered appearance, and questioned her. She\r\ntold her all. At first, the cold, hard woman blamed her, and spoke\r\nharshly to her; but, though cold and harsh, she had a woman's heart, and\r\nshe forgave her. She undertook to tell the story to her brother. He had\r\nhis sister's nature; was a strict, pious, devout man; prayed every\r\nmorning and evening in his family, and, rain or shine, went every Sunday\r\nto hear two dull, cast-iron sermons at the old meeting-house, but he had\r\nnot her woman's heart. He stormed and raved for a time, and then he\r\ncursed his only child, and drove her from his house. The aunt had forty\r\ndollars--the proceeds of sock-knitting and straw-braiding not yet\r\ninvested in hymn-books, and with one sigh for the poor heathen, she gave\r\nit to her. With that, and a small satchel of clothes, and with two\r\nlittle hearts beating under her bosom, she went out into the world.\r\nWhere could she go? She knew not, but she wandered on till she reached\r\nthe village. The stage was standing before the tavern-door, and the\r\ndriver was mounting the box to start. She thought for a moment. She\r\ncould not stay there. It would anger her father, if she did--no one\r\nwould take her in--and besides, she could not meet, in her misery and\r\nher shame, those who had known her since childhood. She spoke to the\r\ndriver; he dismounted, opened the door, and she took a seat in the coach\r\nto go--she did not know whither, she did not care where.\r\n\r\nThey rode all night, and in the morning reached Concord. As she stepped\r\nfrom the stage, the red-faced landlord asked her if she was going\r\nfurther. She said, 'I do not know, sir;' but then a thought struck her.\r\nIt was five months since Hallet had started for Europe, and perhaps he\r\nhad returned. She would go to him. Though he could not undo the wrong he\r\nhad done, he still could aid and pity her. She asked the route to\r\nBoston, and after a light meal, was on the way thither.\r\n\r\nShe arrived after dark, and was driven to the Marlboro Hotel--that\r\nEastern Eden for lone women and tobacco-eschewing men--and there she\r\npassed the night. Though weak from recent illness, and worn and wearied\r\nwith the long journey, she could not rest or sleep. The great sorrow\r\nthat had fallen on her had driven rest from her heart, and quiet sleep\r\nfrom her eye-lids forever. In the morning she inquired the way to\r\nRussell, Rollins & Co.'s, and after a long search found the grim, old\r\nwarehouse. She started to go up the rickety old stairs, but her heart\r\nfailed her. She turned away and wandered off through the narrow, crooked\r\nstreets--she did not know for how long. She met the busy crowd hurrying\r\nto and fro, but no one noticed or cared for her. She looked at the neat,\r\ncheerful homes smiling around her, and she thought how every one had\r\nshelter and friends but her. She gazed up at the cold, gray sky, and oh!\r\nhow she longed that it might fall down and bury her forever. And still\r\nshe wandered till her limbs grew weary and her heart grew faint. At last\r\nshe sank down exhausted, and wept--wept as only the lost and the utterly\r\nforsaken can weep. Some little boys were playing near, and after a time\r\nthey left their sports, and came to her. They spoke kindly to her, and\r\nit gave her strength. She rose and walked on again. A livery-carriage\r\npassed her, and she spoke to the coachman. After a long hour she stood\r\nonce more before the old warehouse. It was late in the afternoon, and\r\nshe had eaten nothing all day, and was very faint and tired. As she\r\nturned to go up the old stairway, her heart again failed her, but\r\nsummoning all her strength, she at last entered the old counting-room.\r\n\r\nA tall, spare, pleasant-faced man, was standing at the desk, and she\r\nasked him if Mr. John Hallet was there.\r\n\r\n'No, madam, he's in Europe.'\r\n\r\n'When will he come back, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Not for a year, madam;' and David raised his glasses and looked at her.\r\nHe had not done it before.\r\n\r\nHer last hope had failed, and with a heavy, crushing pain in her heart,\r\nand a dull, dizzy feeling in her head, she turned to go. As she\r\nstaggered away a hand was gently placed on her arm, and a mild voice\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'You are ill, madam; sit down.'\r\n\r\nShe took the proffered seat, and an old gentleman came out of the inner\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n'What! what's this, David?' he asked. 'What ails the young woman?'\r\n\r\n(She was then not quite seventeen.)\r\n\r\n'She's ill, sir,' said David.\r\n\r\n'Only a little tired, sir; I shall be better soon.'\r\n\r\n'But thee _is_ ill, my child; thee looks so. Come here, Kate!' and the\r\nold gentleman raised his voice as if speaking to some one in the inner\r\nroom. The sick girl lifted her eyes, and saw a blue-eyed, golden-haired\r\nyoung woman, not so old as she was.\r\n\r\n'She seems very sick, father. Please, David, get me some water;' and the\r\nyoung lady undid the poor girl's bonnet, and bathed her temples with the\r\ncool, grateful fluid. After a while the old gentleman asked:\r\n\r\n'What brought thee here, young woman?'\r\n\r\n'I came to see John--Mr. Hallet, I mean, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Thee knows John, then?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Where does thee live?'\r\n\r\nShe was about to say that she had no home, but checking herself, for it\r\nwould seem strange that a young girl who knew John Hallet, should be\r\nhomeless, she answered:\r\n\r\n'In New-Hampshire. I live near old Mr. Hallet's, sir. I came to see John\r\nbecause I've known him ever since I was a child.'\r\n\r\nShe drank of the water, and after a little time rose to go. As she\r\nturned toward the door, the thought of going out alone, with her great\r\nsorrow, into the wide, desolate world, crossed her mind, the heavy,\r\ncrushing pain came again into her heart, the dull, dizzy feeling into\r\nher head, the room reeled, and she fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was after dark when she came to herself. She was lying on a bed in a\r\nlarge, splendidly furnished room, and the same old gentleman and the\r\nsame young woman were with her. Another old gentleman was there, and as\r\nshe opened her eyes, he said:\r\n\r\n'She will be better soon; her nervous system has had a severe shock; the\r\ndifficulty is there. If you could get her to confide in you, 'twould\r\nrelieve her; it is _hidden_ grief that kills people. She needs rest,\r\nnow. Come, my child, take this,' and he held a fluid to her lips. She\r\ndrank it, and in a few moments sank into a deep slumber.\r\n\r\nIt was late on the following morning when she awoke, and found the same\r\nyoung woman at her bedside.\r\n\r\n'You are better, now, my sister. A few days of quiet rest will make you\r\nwell,' said the young lady.\r\n\r\nThe kind, loving words, almost the first she had ever heard from woman,\r\nwent to her heart, and she wept bitterly as she replied:\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, there is no rest, no more rest for me!'\r\n\r\n'Why so? What is it that grieves you? Tell me; it will ease your pain to\r\nlet me share it with you.'\r\n\r\nShe told her, but she withheld his name. Once it rose to her lips, but\r\nshe thought how those good people would despise him, how Mr. Russell\r\nwould cast him off, how his prospects would be blasted, and she kept it\r\nback.\r\n\r\n'And that is the reason you went to John? You knew what a good,\r\nChristian young man he is, and you thought he would aid you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!' said the sick girl.\r\n\r\nThus she punished him for the great wrong he had done her; thus she\r\nrecompensed him for robbing her of home, of honor, and of peace!\r\n\r\nKate told her father the story, and the good old man gave her a room in\r\none of his tenement houses, and there, a few months later, she gave\r\nbirth to a little boy and girl. She was very sick, but Kate attended to\r\nher wants, procured her a nurse, and a physician, and gave her what she\r\nneeded more than all else--kindness and sympathy.\r\n\r\nPrevious to her sickness she had earned a support by her needle, and\r\nwhen she was sufficiently recovered, again had recourse to it. Her\r\nearnings were scanty, for she was not yet strong, but they were eked out\r\nby an occasional remittance from her aunt, which good lady still adhered\r\nto her sock-knitting, straw-braiding habits, but had turned her back\r\nresolutely on her benighted brethren and sisters of the Feejee Islands.\r\n\r\nThus nearly a year wore away, when her little girl sickened and died.\r\nShe felt a mother's pang at first, but she shed no tears, for she knew\r\nit was 'well with the child;' that it had gone where it would never know\r\na fate like hers.\r\n\r\nThe watching with it, added to her other labors, again undermined her\r\nhealth. The remittance from her aunt did not come as usual, and though\r\nshe paid no rent, she soon found herself unable to earn a support. The\r\nRussells had been so good, so kind, had done so much for her, that she\r\ncould not ask them for more. What, then, should she do? One day, while\r\nshe was in this strait, Kate called to see her, and casually mentioned\r\nthat John Hallet had returned. She struggled with her pride for a time,\r\nbut at last made up her mind to apply to him. She wrote to him; told him\r\nof her struggles, of her illness, of her many sufferings, of her little\r\nboy--his image, his child--then playing at her feet, and she besought\r\nhim by the love he bore her in their childhood, not to let his once\r\naffianced wife, and his poor, innocent child STARVE!\r\n\r\nLong weeks went by, but no answer came; and again she wrote him.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after sending this last letter, as she was crossing\r\nthe Common to her attic in Charles street, she met him. He was alone,\r\nand saw her, but attempted to pass her without recognition. She stood\r\nsquarely in his way, and told him she _would_ be heard. He admitted\r\nhaving received her letters, but said he could do nothing for her; that\r\nthe brat was not _his_; that she must not attempt to fasten on _him_ the\r\nfruit of her debaucheries; that no one would believe her if she did; and\r\nhe added, as he turned away, that he was a married man, and a Christian,\r\nand could not be seen talking with a lewd woman like her.\r\n\r\nShe was stunned. She sank down on one of the benches on the Common, and\r\ntried to weep; but the tears would not come. For the first time since he\r\nso deeply, basely wronged her, she felt a bitter feeling rising in her\r\nheart. She rose, and turned her steps up Beacon Hill toward Mr.\r\nRussell's, fully determined to tell Kate all. She was admitted, and\r\nshown to Miss Russell's room. She told her that she had met her seducer,\r\nand how he had cast her off.\r\n\r\n'Who is he?' asked Kate. 'Tell me, and father shall publish him from one\r\nend of the universe to the other! He does not deserve to live.'\r\n\r\nHis name trembled on her tongue. A moment more, and John Hallet would\r\nhave been a ruined man, branded with a mark that would have followed him\r\nthrough the world. But she paused; the vision of his happy wife, of the\r\ninnocent child just born to him, rose before her, and the words melted\r\naway from her lips unspoken.\r\n\r\nKate spoke kindly and encouragingly to her, but she heeded her not. One\r\nonly thought had taken possession of her: how could she throw off the\r\nmighty load that was pressing on her soul?\r\n\r\nAfter a time, she rose and left the house. As she walked down Beacon\r\nstreet, the sun was just sinking in the West, and its red glow mounted\r\nmidway up the heavens. As she looked at it, the sky seemed one great\r\nmolten sea, with its hot, lurid waves surging all around her. She\r\nthought it came nearer; that it set on fire the green Common and the\r\ngreat houses, and shot fierce, hot flames through her brain and into her\r\nvery soul. For a moment, she was paralyzed and sank to the ground; then\r\nspringing to her feet, she flew to her child. She bounded down the long\r\nhill, and up the steep stairways, and burst into the room of the good\r\nwoman who was tending him, shouting:\r\n\r\n'Fire! fire! The world is on fire! Run! run! the world is on fire!'\r\n\r\nShe caught up her babe and darted away. With him in her arms, she flew\r\ndown Charles street, across the Common, and through the crowded\r\nthoroughfares, till she reached India Wharf, all the while muttering,\r\n'Water, water;' water to quench the fire in her blood, in her brain, in\r\nher very soul.\r\n\r\nShe paused on the pier, and gazed for a moment at the dark, slimy flood;\r\nthen she plunged down, down, where all is forgetfulness!\r\n\r\nShe had a dim recollection of a storm at sea; of a vessel thrown\r\nviolently on its beam-ends; of a great tumult, and of voices louder than\r\nshe ever heard before--voices that rose above the howling of the tempest\r\nand the surging of the great waves--calling out: 'All hands to clear\r\naway the foremast!' But she knew nothing certain. All was chaos.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she remembered was waking one morning in a little room\r\nabout twelve feet square, with a small grated opening in the door. The\r\nsun had just risen, and by its light she saw she was lying on a low,\r\nnarrow bed, whose clothing was spotlessly white and clean. Her little\r\nboy was sleeping by her side. His little cheeks had a rosier, healthier\r\nhue than they ever wore before; and as she turned down the sheet, she\r\nsaw he had grown wonderfully. She could hardly credit her senses. Could\r\nthat be _her_ child?\r\n\r\nShe spoke to him. He opened his eyes and smiled, and put his little\r\nmouth up to hers, saying, 'Kiss, mamma, kiss Fanky.' She took him in her\r\narms, and covered him with kisses. Then she rose to dress herself. A\r\nstrange but neat and tidy gown was on the chair, and she put it on; it\r\nfitted exactly. Franky then rolled over to the front of the bed, and\r\nputting first one little foot out and then the other, let himself down\r\nto the floor. 'Can it be?' she thought, 'can he both walk and talk?'\r\nSoon she heard the bolt turning in the door. It opened, and a pleasant,\r\nelderly woman, with a large bundle of keys at her girdle, entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n'And how do you do this morning, my daughter?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'Very well, ma'am. Where am I, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'You ask where? Then you _are_ well. You haven't been for a long, long\r\ntime, my child.'\r\n\r\n'And _where_ am I, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'Why, you are here--at Bloomingdale.'\r\n\r\n'How long have I been here?'\r\n\r\n'Let me see; it must be near fifteen months, now.'\r\n\r\n'And who brought me?'\r\n\r\n'A vessel captain. He said that just as he was hauling out of the dock\r\nat Boston, you jumped into the water with your child. One of his men\r\nsprang overboard and saved you. The vessel couldn't put back, so he\r\nbrought you here.'\r\n\r\n'Merciful heaven! did I do that?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. You must have been sorely troubled, my child. But never mind--it\r\nis all over now. But hasn't Franky grown? Isn't he a handsome boy? Come\r\nhere to grandma, my baby.' And the good woman sat down on a chair, while\r\nthe little fellow ran to her, put his small arms around her neck, and\r\nkissed her over and over again. Children are intuitive judges of\r\ncharacter; no really bad man or woman ever had the love of a child.\r\n\r\n'Yes, he _has_ grown. You call him Franky, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; we didn't know his name. What had you named him?'\r\n\r\n'John Hallet.'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke those words, a sharp pang shot through her heart. It was\r\nwell that her child had another name!\r\n\r\nShe was soon sufficiently recovered to leave the asylum. By the kind\r\noffices of the matron, she got employment in a cap-factory, and a plain\r\nbut comfortable boarding-place in the lower part of the city. She worked\r\nat the shop, and left Franky during the day with her landlady, a\r\nkind-hearted but poor woman. Her earnings were but three dollars a week,\r\nand their board was two and a quarter; but on the balance she contrived\r\nto furnish herself and her child with clothes. The only luxury she\r\nindulged in was an occasional _walk_, on Sunday to Bloomingdale, to see\r\nher good friend the kind-hearted matron.\r\n\r\nThus things went on for two years; and if not happy, she was at least\r\ncomfortable. Her father never relented; but her aunt wrote her often,\r\nand there was comfort in the thought that, at least, one of her early\r\nfriends had not cast her off. The good lady, too, sent her now and again\r\nsmall remittances, but they came few and far between; for as the pious\r\nwoman grew older, her heart gradually returned to its first love--the\r\npoor heathen.\r\n\r\nTo Kate Russell Fanny wrote as soon she left the asylum, telling her of\r\nall that had happened as far as she knew, and thanking her for all her\r\ngoodness and kindness to her. She waited some weeks, but no answer came;\r\nthen she wrote again, but still no answer came, though that time she\r\nwaited two or three months. Fearing then that something had befallen\r\nher, she mustered courage to write Mr. Russell. Still she got no reply,\r\nand she reluctantly concluded--though she had not asked them for\r\naid--that they had ceased to feel interested in her.\r\n\r\n'They had not, madam. Kate has often spoken very kindly of you. She\r\nwanted to come here to-day, but I did not know this, and I could not\r\nbring her _here_!'\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with a strange surprise. Her eyes lighted, and her face\r\nbeamed, as she said: 'And you know _her_, too!'\r\n\r\n'Know her! She is to be my wife very soon.'\r\n\r\nShe wept as she said: 'And you will tell her how much I love her--how\r\ngrateful I am to her?'\r\n\r\n'I will,' I replied. I did not tell the poor girl, as I might have done,\r\nthat Hallet had at that time access to Mr. Russell's mails, and that,\r\nknowing her hand-writing, he had undoubtedly intercepted her letters.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, she resumed her story.\r\n\r\nAt the end of those two years, a financial panic swept over the country,\r\nprostrating the great houses, and sending want and suffering into the\r\nattics--not homes, for they have none--of the poor sewing-women. The\r\nfirm that employed her failed, and Fanny was thrown out of work. She\r\nwent to her good friend the matron, who interested some 'benevolent'\r\nladies in her behalf, and they procured her shirts to make at\r\ntwenty-five cents apiece! She could hardly do enough of them to pay her\r\nboard; but she could do the work at home with Franky, and that was a\r\ncomfort, for he was growing to be a bright, intelligent, affectionate\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, her aunt and the good matron died. She mourned for them\r\nsincerely, for they were all the friends she had.\r\n\r\nThe severe times affected her landlady. Being unable to pay her rent,\r\nshe was sold out by the sheriff, and Fanny had to seek other lodgings.\r\nShe then took a little room by herself, and lived alone.\r\n\r\nThe death of the matron was a great calamity to her, for her\r\n'benevolent' friends soon lost interest in her, and took from her the\r\npoor privilege of making shirts at twenty-five cents apiece! When this\r\nbefell her, she had but four dollars and twenty cents in the world. This\r\nshe made furnish food to herself and her child for four long weeks,\r\nwhile she vainly sought for work. She offered to do any thing--to sew,\r\nscrub, cook, wash--any thing; but no! there was nothing for\r\nher--NOTHING! She must drain the cup to the very dregs, that the\r\nvengeance of God--and He would not be just if He did not take terrible\r\nvengeance for crime like his--might sink John Hallet to the lowest hell!\r\n\r\nFor four days she had not tasted food. Her child was sick. She had\r\n_begged_ a few crumbs for him, but even _he_ had eaten nothing all day.\r\nThen the tempter came, and--why need I say it?--she sinned. Turn not\r\naway from her, O you, her sister, who have never known a want or felt a\r\nwoe! Turn not away. It was not for herself; she would have died--gladly\r\nhave died! It was for her sick, starving child that she did it. Could\r\nshe, _should_ she have seen him STARVE?\r\n\r\nSome months after that, she noticed in the evening paper, among the\r\narrivals at the Astor House, the name of John Hallet. That night she\r\nwent to him. She was shown to his room, and rapping at the door, was\r\nasked to 'walk in.' She stepped inside and stood before him. He sprang\r\nfrom his seat, and told her to leave him. She begged him to hear\r\nher--for only one moment to hear her. He stamped on the floor in his\r\nrage, and told her again to go! She did not go, for she told him of the\r\npit of infamy into which she had fallen, and she prayed him, as he hoped\r\nfor heaven, as he loved his own child, to save her! Then, with terrible\r\ncurses, he opened the door, laid his hands upon her, and--thrust her\r\nfrom the room!\r\n\r\nWhy should I tell how, step by step, she went down; how want came upon\r\nher; how a terrible disease fastened its fangs on her vitals; how Death\r\nwalked with her up and down Broadway in the gas-light; how, in her very\r\nhours of shame, there came to her visions of the innocent\r\npast--thoughts of what she MIGHT HAVE BEEN and of what SHE WAS? The mere\r\nrecital of such misery harrows the very soul; and, O God! what must be\r\nthe REALITY!\r\n\r\nAs she finished the tale which, in broken sentences, with long pauses\r\nand many tears, she had given me, I rose from my seat, and pacing the\r\nroom, while the hot tears ran from my eyes, I said; 'Rest easy, my poor\r\ngirl! As sure as God lives, you shall be avenged. John Hallet shall feel\r\nthe misery he has made you feel. I will pull him down--down so low, that\r\nthe very beggars shall hoot at him in the streets!'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no; do not harm him! Leave him to God. He may yet repent!'\r\n\r\nThe long exertion had exhausted her. The desire to tell me her story had\r\nsustained her; but when she had finished, she sank rapidly. I felt of\r\nher pulse--it scarcely beat; I passed my hand up her arm--it was icy\r\ncold to the elbow! She was indeed dying. Giving her some of the cordial,\r\nI called her child.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, she took each of us by the hand, and said to Franky:\r\n'My child--your mother is going away--from you. Be a good boy--love this\r\ngentleman--he will take care of you!' Then to me she said: 'Be kind to\r\nhim, sir. He is--a good child!'\r\n\r\n'Have comfort, madam, he shall be my son. Kate will be a mother to him!'\r\n\r\n'Bless you! bless her! A mother's blessing--will be on you both! The\r\nblessing of God--will be on you--and if the dead can come back--to\r\ncomfort those they love--I will come back--and comfort _you_!'\r\n\r\nI do not know--I can not know till the veil which hides her world from\r\nours, is lifted from my eyes, but there have been times--many\r\ntimes--since she said that, when Kate and I have thought she was KEEPING\r\nHER WORD!\r\n\r\nFor a half-hour she lay without speaking, still holding our hands in\r\nhers. Then, in a low tone--so low that I had to bend down to hear--she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Oh! is it not beautiful! Don't you hear? And look! oh! look! And my\r\nmother, too! Oh! it is too bright for such as I!'\r\n\r\nThe heavenly gates had opened to her! She had caught a vision of the\r\nbetter land!\r\n\r\nIn a moment she said:\r\n\r\n'Farewell my friend--my child--I will come----' Then a low sound\r\nrattled in her throat, and she passed away, just as the last rays of the\r\nwinter sun streamed through the low window. One of its bright beams\r\nrested on her face, and lingered there till we laid her away forever.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as I sit with Kate on this grassy mound, this mild summer\r\nafternoon, and write these lines, we talk together of her short, sad\r\nlife, of her calm, peaceful death, and floating down through the long\r\nyears, comes to us the blessing of her pure, redeemed spirit, pleasant\r\nas the breath of the flowers that are growing on her grave. We look up,\r\nand, through our thick falling tears, read again the words which we\r\nplaced over her in the long ago:\r\n\r\n  FRANCES MANDELL:\r\n\r\n  Aged 23.\r\n\r\n  SHE SUFFERED AND SHE DIED.\r\n\r\n  WEEP FOR HER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKE CARE!\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the blades of shears are biting,\r\n  Finger not their edges keen;\r\n  When man and wife are fighting,\r\n  He faces ill who comes between.\r\n  JOHN BULL, in our grief delighting,\r\n  Take care how you intervene!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULDER-STRAPS;\r\n\r\nOR, MEN, MANNERS, AND MOTIVES IN 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     INTRODUCTORY AND EPISODICAL--MEASURING-WORMS, DUSSELDORF PICTURES,\r\n     AND PARISIAN FORTUNE-TELLERS.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be an odd jumble.\r\n\r\nWithout being an odd jumble, it could not possibly reflect American life\r\nand manners at the present time with any degree of fidelity; for the\r\nfoundations of the old in society have been broken up as effectually,\r\nwithin the past two years, as were those of the great deep at the time\r\nof Noah's flood, and the disruption has not taken place long enough ago\r\nfor the new to have assumed any appearance of stability. The old deities\r\nof fashion have been swept away in the flood of revolution, and the new\r\nwhich are eventually to take their place have scarcely yet made\r\nthemselves apparent through the general confusion. The millionaire of\r\ntwo years ago, intent at that time on the means by which the revenues\r\nfrom his brown-stone houses and pet railroad stocks could be spent to\r\nthe most showy advantage, has become the struggling man of to-day,\r\nintent upon keeping up appearances, and happy if diminished and doubtful\r\nrents can even be made to meet increasing taxes. The struggling man of\r\nthat time has meanwhile sprung into fortune and position, through lucky\r\nadventures in government transportations or army contracts; and the\r\njewelers of Broadway and Chestnut street are busy resetting the diamonds\r\nof decayed families, to sparkle on brows and bosoms that only a little\r\nwhile ago beat with pride at an added weight of California paste or\r\nKentucky rock-crystal. The most showy equipages that have this year been\r\nflashing at Newport and Saratoga, were never seen between the\r\nbathing-beach and Fort Adams, or between Congress Spring and the Lake,\r\nin the old days; and if opera should ever revive, and the rich notes of\r\nmelody repay the _impresario_, as they enrapture the audience at the\r\nAcademy, there will be new faces in the most prominent boxes, almost as\r\n_outre_ and unaccustomed in their appearance there as was that of the\r\nhard-featured Western President, framed in a shock head and a turn-down\r\ncollar, meeting the gaze of astonished Murray Hill, when he passed an\r\nhour here on his way to the inauguration.\r\n\r\nQuite as notable a change has taken place in personal reputation. Many\r\nof the men on whom the country depended as most likely to prove able\r\ndefenders in the day of need, have not only discovered to the world\r\ntheir worthlessness, but filled up the fable of the man who leaned upon\r\na reed, by fatally piercing those whom they had betrayed to their fall.\r\nBubble-characters have burst, and high-sounding phrases have been\r\nexploded. Men whose education and antecedents should have made them\r\nbrave and true, have shown themselves false and cowardly--impotent for\r\ngood, and active only for evil. Unconsidered nobodies have meanwhile\r\nsprung forth from the mass of the people, and equally astonished\r\nthemselves and others by the power, wisdom and courage they have\r\ndisplayed. In cabinet and camp, in army and navy, in the editorial chair\r\nand in the halls of eloquence, the men from whom least was expected have\r\ndone most, and those upon whom the greatest expectations had been\r\nfounded have only given another proof of the fallacy of all human\r\ncalculations. All has been change, all has been transition, in the\r\nestimation men have held of themselves, and the light in which they\r\npresented themselves to each other.\r\n\r\nOpinions of duties and recognitions of necessities have known a change\r\nnot less remarkable. What yesterday we believed to be fallacy, to-day we\r\nknow to be truth. What seemed the fixed and immutable purpose of God\r\nonly a few short months ago, we have already discovered to have been\r\nfounded only in human passion or ambition. What seemed eternal has\r\npassed away, and what appeared to be evanescent has assumed stability.\r\nThe storm has been raging around us, and doing its work not the less\r\ndestructively because we failed to perceive that we were passing through\r\nany thing more threatening than a summer shower. While we have stood\r\nupon the bank of the swelling river, and pointed to some structure of\r\nold rising on the bank, declaring that not a stone could be moved until\r\nthe very heavens should fall, little by little the foundations have been\r\nundermined, and the full crash of its falling has first awoke us from\r\nour security. That without which we said that the nation could not live,\r\nhas fallen and been destroyed; and yet the nation does not die, but\r\ngives promise of a better and more enduring life. What we cherished we\r\nhave lost; what we did not ask or expect has come to us; the effete old\r\nis passing away, and out of the ashes of its decay is springing forth\r\nthe young and vigorous new. Change, transition, every where and in all\r\nthings: how can society fail to be disrupted, and who can speak, write,\r\nor think with the calm decorum of by-gone days?\r\n\r\nAll this is obtrusively philosophical, of course, and correspondingly\r\nout of place. But it may serve as a sort of forlorn hope--mental food\r\nfor powder--while the narrative reserve is brought forward; and there is\r\na dim impression on the mind of the writer that it may be found to have\r\nsome connection with that which is necessarily to follow.\r\n\r\nSo let the odd jumble be prepared, perhaps with ingredients as\r\nincongruous as those which at present compose what we used to call the\r\nrepublic, and as unevenly distributed as have been honors and emoluments\r\nduring a struggle which should have found every man in his place, and\r\nevery national energy employed to its best purpose.\r\n\r\nI was crossing the City Hall Park to dinner at Delmonico's, one\r\nafternoon early in July, in company with a friend who had spent some\r\nyears in Europe, and only recently returned. He may be called Ned\r\nMartin, for the purposes of this narration. He had left the country in\r\nits days of peace and prosperity, a frank, whole-souled young artist,\r\nhis blue eyes clear as the day, and his faith in humanity unbounded. He\r\nhad resided for a long time at Paris, and at other periods been\r\nsojourning at Rome, Florence, Vienna, Dusseldorf, and other places where\r\nart studies called him or artist company invited him. He had come back\r\nto his home and country after the great movements of the war were\r\ninaugurated, and when the great change which had been initiated was most\r\nobvious to an observing eye. I had heard of his arrival in New York, but\r\nfailed to meet him, and not long after heard that he had gone down to\r\nvisit the lines of our army on the Potomac. Then I had heard of his\r\nreturn some weeks after, and eventually I had happened upon him drinking\r\na good-will glass with a party of friends at one of the popular\r\ndown-town saloons, when stepping in for a post-prandial cigar. The\r\nresult of that meeting had been a promise that we would dine together\r\none evening, and the after-result was, that we were crossing the Park to\r\nkeep that promise.\r\n\r\nI have said that Ned Martin left this country a frank, blue-eyed,\r\nhappy-looking young artist, who seemed to be without a care or a\r\nsuspicion. It had only needed a second glance at his face, on the day\r\nwhen I first met him at the bar of the drinking-saloon, to know that a\r\ngreat change had fallen upon him. He was yet too young for age to have\r\nleft a single furrow upon his face; not a fleck of silver had yet\r\ntouched his brown hair, nor had his fine, erect form been bowed by\r\neither over-labor or dissipation. Yet he was changed, and the second\r\nglance showed that the change was in the _eyes_. Amid the clear blue\r\nthere lay a dark, sombre shadow, such as only shows itself in eyes that\r\nhave been turned _inward_. We usually say of the wearer of such eyes,\r\nafter looking into them a moment, 'That man has studied much;' 'has\r\nsuffered much;' or, '_he is a spiritualist_.' By the latter expression,\r\nwe mean that he looks more or less beneath the surface of events that\r\nmeet him in the world--that he is more or less a student of the\r\nspiritual in mentality, and of the supernatural in cause and effect.\r\nSuch eyes do not stare, they merely gaze. When they look at you, they\r\nlook at something else through you and behind you, of which you may or\r\nmay not be a part.\r\n\r\nLet me say here, (this chapter being professedly episodical,) that the\r\npainter who can succeed in transferring to canvas that expression of\r\n_seeing more than is presented to the physical eye_, has achieved a\r\ntriumph over great difficulties. Frequent visitors to the old Dusseldorf\r\nGallery will remember two instances, perhaps by the same painter, of the\r\neye being thus made to reveal the inner thought and a life beyond that\r\npassing at the moment. The first and most notable is in the 'Charles the\r\nSecond Fleeing from the Battle of Worcester.' The king and two nobles\r\nare in the immediate foreground, in flight, while far away the sun is\r\ngoing down in a red glare behind the smoke of battle, the lurid flames\r\nof the burning town, and the royal standard just fluttering down from\r\nthe battlements of a castle lost by the royal arms at the very close of\r\nCromwell's 'crowning mercy.' Through the smoke of the middle distance\r\ncan be dimly seen dusky forms in flight, or in the last hopeless\r\nconflict. Each of the nobles at the side of the fugitive king is heavily\r\narmed, with sword in hand, mounted on heavy, galloping horses going at\r\nhigh speed; and each is looking out anxiously, with head turned aside as\r\nhe flies, for any danger which may menace--not himself, but the\r\nsovereign. Charles Stuart, riding between them, is mounted upon a dark,\r\nhigh-stepping, pure-blooded English horse. He wears the peaked hat of\r\nthe time, and his long hair--that which afterward became so notorious in\r\nthe masks and orgies of Whitehall, and in the prosecution of his amours\r\nin the purlieus of the capital--floats out in wild dishevelment from his\r\nshoulders. He is dressed in the dark velvet, short cloak, and broad,\r\npointed collar peculiar to pictures of himself and his unfortunate\r\nfather; shows no weapon, and is leaning ungracefully forward, as if\r\noutstripping the hard-trotting speed of his horse. But the true interest\r\nof this figure, and of the whole picture, is concentrated in the eyes.\r\nThose sad, dark eyes, steady and immovable in their fixed gaze, reveal\r\nwhole pages of history and whole years of suffering. The fugitive king\r\nis not thinking of his flight, of any dangers that may beset him, of the\r\ncompanions at his side, or even of where he shall lay his periled head\r\nin the night that is coming. Those eyes have shut away the physical and\r\nthe real, and through the mists of the future they are trying to read\r\nthe great question of _fate_! Worcester is lost, and with it a kingdom:\r\nis he to be henceforth a crownless king and a hunted fugitive, or has\r\nthe future its compensations? This is what the fixed and glassy eyes are\r\nsaying to every beholder, and there is not one who does not answer the\r\nquestion with a mental response forced by that mute appeal of suffering\r\nthought: 'The king shall have his own again!'\r\n\r\nThe second picture in the same collection is much smaller, and commands\r\nless attention; but it tells another story of the same great struggle\r\nbetween King and Parliament, through the agency of the same feature. A\r\nwounded cavalier, accompanied by one of his retainers, also wounded, is\r\nbeing forced along on foot, evidently to imprisonment, by one of\r\nCromwell's Ironsides and a long-faced, high-hatted Puritan cavalry-man,\r\nboth on horseback, and a third on foot, with _musquetoon_ on shoulder.\r\nThe cavalier's garments are rent and blood-stained, and there is a\r\nbloody handkerchief binding his brow and telling how, when his house was\r\nsurprised and his dependents slaughtered, he himself fought till he was\r\nstruck down, bound and overpowered. He strides sullenly along, looking\r\nneither to the right nor the left; and the triumphant captors behind him\r\nknow nothing of the story that is told in his face. The eyes, fixed and\r\nsteady in the shadow of the bloody bandage, tell nothing of the pain of\r\nhis wound or the tension of the cords which are binding his crossed\r\nwrists. In their intense depth, which really seems to convey the\r\nimpression of looking through forty feet of the still but dangerous\r\nwaters of Lake George and seeing the glimmering of the golden sand\r\nbeneath, we read of a burned house and an outraged family, and we see a\r\nprophecy written there, that if his mounted guards could read, they\r\nwould set spurs and flee away like the wind--a calm, silent, but\r\nirrevocable prophecy: 'I can bear all this, for my time is coming! Not a\r\nman of all these will live, not a roof-tree that shelters them but will\r\nbe in ashes, when I take my revenge!' Not a gazer but knows, through\r\nthose marvelous eyes alone, that the day is coming that he _will_ have\r\nhis revenge, and that the subject of pity is the victorious Roundhead\r\ninstead of the wounded and captive cavalier!\r\n\r\nI said, before this long digression broke the slender chain of\r\nnarration, that some strange, spiritualistic shadow lay in the eyes of\r\nNed Martin; and I could have sworn, without the possibility of an error,\r\nthat he had become an habitual reader of the inner life, and almost\r\nbeyond question a communicant with influences which some hold to be\r\nimpossible and others unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe long measuring-worms hung pendent from their gossamer threads, as we\r\npassed through the Park, as they have done, destroying the foliage, in\r\nalmost every city of the Northern States. One brushed my face as I\r\npassed, and with the stick in my hand I struck the long threads of\r\ngossamer and swept several of the worms to the ground. One, a very large\r\nand long one, happened to fall on Martin's shoulder, lying across the\r\nblue flannel of his coat in the exact position of a shoulder-strap.\r\n\r\n'I say, Martin,' I said, 'I have knocked down one of the worms upon\r\n_you_.'\r\n\r\n'Have you?' he replied listlessly, 'then be good enough to brush it off,\r\nif it does not crawl off itself. I do not like worms.'\r\n\r\n'I do not know who _does_ like them,' I said, 'though I suppose, being\r\n'worms of the dust,' we ought to bear affection instead of disgust\r\ntoward our fellow-reptiles. But, funnily enough,' and I held him still\r\nby the shoulder for a moment to contemplate the oddity, 'this\r\nmeasuring-worm, which is a very big one, has fallen on your shoulder,\r\nand seems disposed to remain there, in the very position of a\r\n_shoulder-strap_! You must belong to the army!'\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine what would be the quick, convulsive writhing\r\nmotion with which one would shrink aside and endeavor to get\r\ninstantaneously away from it, when told that an asp, a centipede or a\r\nyoung rattlesnake was lying on the shoulder, and ready to strike its\r\ndeadly fangs into the neck. But it is not easy to imagine that even a\r\nnervous woman, afraid of a cockroach and habitually screaming at a\r\nmouse, would display any extraordinary emotion on being told that a\r\nharmless measuring-worm had fallen upon the shoulder of her dress. What\r\nwas my surprise, then, to see the face of Martin, that had been so\r\nimpassive the moment before when told that the worm had fallen upon his\r\ncoat, suddenly assume an expression of the most awful fear and agony,\r\nand his whole form writhe with emotion, as he shrunk to one side in the\r\neffort to eject the intruder instantaneously!\r\n\r\n'Good God! Off with it--quick! Quick, for heaven's sake!' he cried, in a\r\nfrightened, husky voice that communicated his terror to me, and almost\r\nsinking to the ground as he spoke.\r\n\r\nOf course I instantly brushed the little reptile away; but it was quite\r\na moment before he assumed an erect position, and I saw two or three\r\nquick shudders pass over his frame, such as I had not seen since, many a\r\nlong year before, I witnessed the horrible tortures of a strong man\r\nstricken with hydrophobia. Then he asked, in a voice low, quavering and\r\nbroken:\r\n\r\n'Is it gone?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly it is!' I said. 'Why, Martin, what under heaven can have\r\naffected you in this manner? I told you that I had knocked a worm on\r\nyour coat, and you did not appear to heed it any more than if it had\r\nbeen a speck of dust. It was only when I mentioned the _shape_ it had\r\nassumed, that you behaved so unaccountably! What does it mean? Are you\r\nafraid of worms, or only of _shoulder-straps_?' And I laughed at the\r\nabsurdity of the latter supposition.\r\n\r\n'Humph!' said Martin, who seemed to have recovered his equanimity, but\r\nnot shaken off the impression. 'You laugh. Perhaps you will laugh more\r\nwhen I tell you that it was not the worm, _as_ a worm, of which I was\r\nthinking at all, and that my terror--yes, I need not mince words, I was\r\nfor the moment in abject terror--had to do altogether with the shape\r\nthat little crawling pest had assumed, and the part of my coat on which\r\nhe had taken a fancy to lodge himself!'\r\n\r\n'No, I should not laugh,' I said; 'but I _should_ ask an explanation of\r\nwhat seems very strange and unaccountable. Shall I lacerate a feeling,\r\nor tread upon ground made sacred by a grief, if I do so?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' was the reply. 'In fact, I feel at this moment very much\r\nas the Ancient Mariner may have done the moment before he met the\r\nwedding-guest--when, in fact, he had nobody to button-hole, and felt the\r\nstrong necessity of boring some one!' There was a tone of gayety in this\r\nreply, which told me how changeable and mercurial my companion could be;\r\nand I read an evident understanding of the character and mission of the\r\nnoun-substantive 'bore,' which assured me that he was the last person in\r\nthe world likely to play such a part. 'However,' he concluded, 'wait a\r\nbit. When we have concluded the raspberries, and wet our lips with\r\ngreen-seal, I will tell you all that I myself know of a very singular\r\nepisode in an odd life.'\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after, the conditions of which he spoke had been\r\naccomplished, over the marble at Delmonico's, and he made me the\r\nfollowing very singular relation:\r\n\r\n'I had returned from a somewhat prolonged stay at Vienna,' he said, 'to\r\nParis, late in 1860. During the fall and winter of that year I spent a\r\ngood deal of time at the Louvre, making a few studies, and satisfying\r\nmyself as to some identities that had been called in question during my\r\nrambles through the Imperial Gallery at Vienna. I lodged in the little\r\nRue Marie Stuart, not far from the Rue Montorgeuil, and only two or\r\nthree minutes' walk from the Louvre, having a baker with a pretty wife\r\nfor my landlord, and a cozy little room in which three persons could sit\r\ncomfortably, for my domicil. As I did not often have more than two\r\nvisitors, my room was quite sufficient; and as I spent a large\r\nproportion of my evenings at other places than my lodgings, the space\r\nwas three quarters of the time more than I needed.\r\n\r\n'I do not know that I can have any objection to your knowing, before I\r\ngo any further, that I am and have been for some years a believer in\r\nthat of which Hamlet speaks when he says: 'There are more things in\r\nheaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.' You\r\nmay call me a _Spiritualist_, if you like, for I have no reverence for\r\nor aversion to names. I do not call _myself_ so; I only say that I\r\nbelieve that more things come to us in the way of knowledge, than we\r\nread, hear, see, taste, smell, or feel with the natural and physical\r\norgans. I know, from the most irrefragable testimony, that there are\r\ncommunications made between one and another, when too far apart to reach\r\neach other by any of the recognized modes of intercourse; though how or\r\nwhy they are made I have no definite knowledge. Electricity--that\r\n'tongs with which God holds the world'--as a strong but odd thinker once\r\nsaid in my presence, may be the medium of communication; but even this\r\nmust be informed by a living and sentient spirit, or it can convey\r\nnothing. People learn what they would not otherwise know, through\r\nmediums which they do not recognize and by processes which they can not\r\nexplain; and to know this is to have left the beaten track of old\r\nbeliefs, and plunged into a maze of speculation, which probably makes\r\nmadmen of a hundred while it is making a wise man of _one_. But I am\r\nwandering too far and telling you nothing.\r\n\r\n'One of my few intimates in Paris, a young Prussian by the name of\r\nAdolph Von Berg, had a habit of visiting mediums, clairvoyants, and, not\r\nto put too fine a point upon it, fortune-tellers. Though I had been in\r\ncompany with clairvoyants in many instances, I had never, before my\r\nreturn to Paris in the late summer of 1860, entered any one of those\r\nplaces in which professional fortune-tellers carried on their business.\r\nIt was early in September, I think, that at the earnest solicitation of\r\nVon Berg, who had been reading and smoking with me at my lodgings, I\r\nwent with him, late in the evening, to a small two-story house in the\r\nRue La Reynie Ogniard, a little street down the Rue Saint Denis toward\r\nthe quays of the Seine, and running from Saint Denis across to the Rue\r\nSaint Martin. The house seemed to me to be one of the oldest in Paris,\r\nalthough built of wood; and the wrinkled and crazy appearance of the\r\nfront was eminently suggestive of the face of an old woman on which time\r\nhad long been plowing furrows to plant disease. The interior of the\r\nhouse, when we entered it by the dingy and narrow hallway, that night,\r\nwell corresponded with the exterior. A tallow-candle in a tin sconce was\r\nburning on the wall, half hiding and half revealing the grime on the\r\nplastering, the cobwebs in the corners, and the rickety stairs by which\r\nit might be supposed that the occupants ascended to the second story.\r\n\r\n'My companion tinkled a small bell that lay upon a little uncovered\r\ntable in the hall, (the outer door having been entirely unfastened, to\r\nall appearance,) and a slattern girl came out from an inner room. On\r\nrecognizing my companion, who had visited the house before, she led the\r\nway without a word to the same room she had herself just quitted. There\r\nwas nothing remarkable in this. A shabby table, and two or three still\r\nmore shabby chairs, occupied the room, and a dark wax-taper stood on the\r\ntable, while at the side opposite the single window a curtain of some\r\ndark stuff shut in almost one entire side of the apartment. We took\r\nseats on the rickety chairs, and waited in silence, Adolph informing me\r\nthat the etiquette (strange name for such a place) of the house did not\r\nallow of conversation, not with the proprietors, carried on in that\r\napartment sacred to the divine mysteries.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps fifteen minutes had elapsed, and I had grown fearfully tired of\r\nwaiting, when the corner of the curtain was suddenly thrown back, and\r\nthe figure of a woman stood in the space thus created. Every thing\r\nbehind her seemed to be in darkness; but some description of bright\r\nlight, which did not show through the curtain at all, and which seemed\r\nalmost dazzling enough to be Calcium or Drummond, shed its rays directly\r\nupon her side-face, throwing every feature from brow to chin into bold\r\nrelief, and making every fold of her dark dress visible. But I scarcely\r\nsaw the dress, the face being so remarkable beyond any thing I had ever\r\nwitnessed. I had looked to see an old, wrinkled hag--it being the\r\ngeneral understanding that all witches and fortune-tellers must be long\r\npast the noon of life; but instead, I saw a woman who could not have\r\nbeen over thirty-five or forty, with a figure of regal magnificence, and\r\na face that would have been, but for one circumstance, beautiful beyond\r\ndescription. Apelles never drew and Phidias never chiseled nose or brow\r\nof more classic perfection, and I have never seen the bow of Cupid in\r\nthe mouth of any woman more ravishingly shown than in that feature of\r\nthe countenance of the sorceress.\r\n\r\n'I said that but for one circumstance, that face would have been\r\nbeautiful beyond description. And yet no human eye ever looked upon a\r\nface more hideously fearful than it was in reality. Even a momentary\r\nglance could not be cast upon it without a shudder, and a longer gaze\r\ninvolved a species of horrible fascination which affected one like a\r\nnightmare. You do not understand yet what was this remarkable and most\r\nhideous feature. I can scarcely find words to describe it to you so that\r\nyou can catch the full force of the idea--I must try, however. You have\r\noften seen Mephistopheles in his flame-colored dress, and caught some\r\nkind of impression that the face was of the same hue, though the fact\r\nwas that it was of the natural color, and only affected by the lurid\r\ncharacter of the dress and by the Satanic penciling of the eyebrows! You\r\nhave? Well, this face was really what that seemed for the moment to be.\r\nIt was redder than blood-red as fire, and yet so strangely did the\r\nflame-color play through it that you knew no paint laid upon the skin\r\ncould have produced the effect. It almost seemed that the skin and the\r\nwhole mass of flesh were transparent, and that the red color came from\r\nsome kind of fire or light within, as the red bottle in a druggist's\r\nwindow might glow when you were standing full in front of it, and the\r\ngas was turned on to full height behind. Every feature--brow, nose,\r\nlips, chin, even the eyes themselves, and their very pupil seemed to be\r\npervaded and permeated by this lurid flame; and it was impossible for\r\nthe beholder to avoid asking himself whether there were indeed spirits\r\nof flame--salamandrines--who sometimes existed out of their own element\r\nand lived and moved as mortals.\r\n\r\n'Have I given you a strange and fearful picture? Be sure that I have not\r\nconveyed to you one thousandth part of the impression made upon myself,\r\nand that until the day I die that strange apparition will remain stamped\r\nupon the tablets of my mind. Diabolical beauty! infernal ugliness!--I\r\nwould give half my life, be it longer or shorter, to be able to explain\r\nwhence such things can come, to confound and stupefy all human\r\ncalculation!'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     MORE OF PARISIAN FORTUNE-TELLERS--THE VISIONS OF THE WHITE\r\n     MIST--REBELLION, GRIEF, HOPE, BRAVERY AND DESPAIR\r\n\r\nIt was after a second bottle of green-seal had flashed out its sparkles\r\ninto the crystal, that Ned Martin drew a long breath like that drawn by\r\na man discharging a painful and necessary duty, and resumed his story:\r\n\r\n'You may some time record this for the benefit of American men and\r\nwomen,' he went on, 'and if you are wise you will deal chiefly in the\r\nlanguage to which they are accustomed. I speak the French, of course,\r\nnearly as well and as readily as the English; but I _think_ in my native\r\ntongue, as most men continue to do, I believe, no matter how many\r\ndialects they acquire; and I shall not interlard this little narrative\r\nwith any French words that can just as well be translated into our\r\nvernacular.\r\n\r\n'Well, as I was saying, there stood my horribly beautiful fiend, and\r\nthere I sat spell-bound before her. As for Adolph, though he had told me\r\nnothing in advance of the peculiarities of her appearance, he had been\r\nfully aware of them, of course, and I had the horrible surprise all to\r\nmyself. I think the sorceress saw the mingled feeling in my face, and\r\nthat a smile blended of pride and contempt contorted the proud features\r\nand made the ghastly face yet more ghastly for one moment. If so, the\r\nexpression soon passed away, and she stood, as before, the incarnation\r\nof all that was terrible and mysterious. At length, still retaining her\r\nplace and fixing her eyes upon Von Berg, she spoke, sharply, brusquely,\r\nand decidedly:\r\n\r\n''You are here again! What do you want?'\r\n\r\n''I wish to introduce my friend, the Baron Charles Denmore, of England,'\r\nanswered Von Berg, 'who wishes----'\r\n\r\n''Nothing!' said the sorceress, the word coming from her lips with an\r\nunmistakably hissing sound. He wants nothing, and he is _not_ the Baron\r\nCharles Denmore! He comes from far away, across the sea, and he would\r\nnot have come here to-night but that you insisted upon it! Take him\r\naway--go away yourself--and never let me see you again unless you have\r\nsomething to ask or you wish me to do you an injury!'\r\n\r\n''But----' began Yon Berg.\r\n\r\n''Not another word!' said the sorceress, 'I have said. Go, before you\r\nrepent having come at all!'\r\n\r\n''Madame,' I began to say, awed out of the feeling at least of equality\r\nwhich I should have felt to be proper under such circumstances, and only\r\naware that Adolph, and possibly myself, had incurred the enmity of a\r\nbeing so near to the supernatural as to be at least dangerous--'Madame,\r\nI hope that you will not think----'\r\n\r\n'But here she cut _me_ short, as she had done Von Berg the instant\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n''Hope nothing, young artist!' she said, her voice perceptibly less\r\nharsh and brusque than it had been when speaking to my companion. 'Hope\r\nnothing and ask nothing until you may have occasion; then come to me.'\r\n\r\n''And then?'\r\n\r\n''Then I will answer every question you may think proper to put to me.\r\nStay! you may have occasion to visit me sooner than you suppose, or I\r\nmay have occasion to force knowledge upon you that you will not have the\r\nboldness to seek. If so, I shall send for you. Now go, both of you!'\r\n\r\n'The dark curtain suddenly fell, and the singular vision faded with the\r\nreflected light which had filled the room. The moment after, I heard the\r\nshuffling feet of the slattern girl coming to show us out of the room,\r\nbut, singularly enough, as you will think, not out of the _house_!\r\nWithout a word we followed her--Adolph, who knew the customs of the\r\nplace, merely slipping a five-franc piece into her hand, and in a moment\r\nmore we were out in the street and walking up the Rue Saint Denis. It is\r\nnot worth while to detail the conversation which followed between us as\r\nwe passed up to the Rue Marie Stuart, I to my lodgings and Adolph to his\r\nown, further on, close to the Rue Vivienne, and not far from the\r\nBoulevard Montmartre. Of course I asked him fifty questions, the replies\r\nto which left me quite as much in the dark as before. He knew, he said,\r\nand hundreds of other persons in Paris knew, the singularity of the\r\npersonal appearance of the sorceress, and her apparent power of\r\ndivination, but neither he nor they had any knowledge of her origin. He\r\nhad been introduced at her house several months before, and had asked\r\nquestions affecting his family in Prussia and the chances of descent of\r\ncertain property, the replies to which had astounded him. He had heard\r\nof her using marvelous and fearful incantations, but had never himself\r\nwitnessed any thing of them. In two or three instances, before the\r\npresent, he had taken friends to the house and introduced them under any\r\nname which he chose to apply to them for the time, and the sorceress had\r\nnever before chosen to call him to account for the deception, though,\r\naccording to the assurances of his friends after leaving the house, she\r\nhad never failed to arrive at the truth of their nationalities and\r\npositions in life. There must have been something in myself or my\r\ncircumstances, he averred, which had produced so singular an effect upon\r\nthe witch, (as he evidently believed her to be,) and he had the\r\nimpression that at no distant day I should again hear from her. That was\r\nall, and so we parted, I in any other condition of mind than that\r\npromising sleep, and really without closing my eyes, except for a moment\r\nor two at a time, during the night which followed. When I did attempt to\r\nforce myself into slumber, a red spectre stood continually before me, an\r\nunearthly light seemed to sear my covered eyeballs, and I awoke with a\r\nstart. Days passed before I sufficiently wore away the impression to be\r\ncomfortable, and at least two or three weeks before my rest became again\r\nentirely unbroken.\r\n\r\n'You must be partially aware with what anxiety we Americans temporarily\r\nsojourning on the other side of the Atlantic, who loved the country we\r\nhad left behind on this, watched the succession of events which preceded\r\nand accompanied the Presidential election of that year. Some suppose\r\nthat a man loses his love for his native land, or finds it comparatively\r\nchilled within his bosom, after long residence abroad. The very opposite\r\nis the case, I think! I never knew what the old flag was, until I saw it\r\nwaving from the top of an American consulate abroad, or floating from\r\nthe gaff of one of our war-vessels, when I came down the mountains to\r\nsome port on the Mediterranean. It had been merely red, white and blue\r\nbunting, at home, where the symbols of our national greatness were to be\r\nseen on every hand: it was the _only_ symbol of our national greatness\r\nwhen we were looking at it from beyond the sea; and the man whose eyes\r\nwill not fill with tears and whose throat will not choke a little with\r\noverpowering feeling, when catching sight of the Stars and Stripes where\r\nthey only can be seen to remind him of the glory of the country of which\r\nhe is a part, is unworthy the name of patriot or of man!\r\n\r\n'But to return: Where was I? Oh! I was remarking with what interest we\r\non the other side of the water watched the course of affairs at home\r\nduring that year when the rumble of distant thunder was just heralding\r\nthe storm. You are well aware that without extensive and long-continued\r\nconnivance on the part of sympathizers among the leading people of\r\nEurope--England and France especially--secession could never have been\r\naccomplished so far as it has been; and there never could have been any\r\nhope of its eventual success if there had been no hope of one or both\r\nthese two countries bearing it up on their strong and unscrupulous arms.\r\nThe leaven of foreign aid to rebellion was working even then, both in\r\nLondon and Paris; and perhaps we had opportunities over the water for a\r\nnearer guess at the peril of the nation, than you could have had in the\r\nmidst of your party political squabbles at home.\r\n\r\n'During the months of September and October, when your Wide-Awakes on\r\nthe one hand, and your conservative Democracy on the other, were\r\nparading the streets with banners and music, as they or their\r\npredecessors had done in so many previous contests, and believing that\r\nnothing worse could be involved than a possible party defeat and some\r\nbad feelings, we, who lived where revolutions were common, thought that\r\nwe discovered the smoldering spark which would be blown to revolution\r\nhere. The disruption of the Charleston Convention and through it of the\r\nDemocracy; the bold language and firm resistance of the Republicans; the\r\nwell-understood energy of the uncompromising Abolitionists, and the less\r\ndefined but rabid energy of the Southern fire-eaters: all these were\r\nknown abroad and watched with gathering apprehension. American\r\nnewspapers, and the extracts made from them by the leading journals of\r\nFrance and Europe, commanded more attention among the Americo-French and\r\nEnglish than all other excitements of the time put together.\r\n\r\n'Then followed what you all know--the election, with its radical result\r\nand the threats which immediately succeeded, that 'Old Abe Lincoln'\r\nshould never live to be inaugurated! 'He shall not!' cried the South.\r\n'He shall!' replied the North. To us who knew something of the Spanish\r\nknife and the Italian stiletto, the probabilities seemed to be that he\r\nwould never live to reach Washington. Then the mutterings of the thunder\r\ngrew deeper and deeper, and some disruption seemed inevitable, evident\r\nto us far away, while you at home, it seemed, were eating and drinking,\r\nmarrying and giving in marriage, holding gala-days and enjoying\r\nyourselves generally, on the brink of an arousing volcano from which the\r\nsulphurous smoke already began to ascend to the heavens! So time passed\r\non; autumn became winter, and December was rolling away.\r\n\r\n'I was sitting with half-a-dozen friends in the chess-room at Very's,\r\nabout eleven o'clock on the night of the twentieth of December, talking\r\nover some of the marvelous successes which had been won by Paul Morphy\r\nwhen in Paris, and the unenviable position in which Howard Staunton had\r\nplaced himself by keeping out of the lists through evident fear of the\r\nNew-Orleanian, when Adolph Von Berg came behind me and laid his hand on\r\nmy shoulder.\r\n\r\n''Come with me a moment,' he said, 'you are wanted!'\r\n\r\n''Where?' I asked, getting up from my seat and following him to the\r\ndoor, before which stood a light _coupé_, with its red lights flashing,\r\nthe horse smoking, and the driver in his seat.\r\n\r\n''I have been to-night to the Rue la Reynie Ogniard!' he answered.\r\n\r\n''And are you going there again?' I asked, my blood chilling a little\r\nwith an indefinable sensation of terror, but a sense of satisfaction\r\npredominating at the opportunity of seeing something more of the\r\nmysterious woman.\r\n\r\n''I am!' he answered, 'and so are _you_! She has sent for you! Come!'\r\n\r\n'Without another word I stepped into the _coupé_, and we were rapidly\r\nwhirled away. I asked Adolph how and why I had been summoned; but he\r\nknew nothing more than myself, except that he had visited the sorceress\r\nat between nine and ten that evening, that she had only spoken to him\r\nfor an instant, but ordered him to go at once and find his friend, _the\r\nAmerican_, whom he had falsely introduced some months before as the\r\nEnglish baron. He had been irresistibly impressed with the necessity of\r\nobedience, though it would break in upon his own arrangements for the\r\nlater evening, (which included an hour at the Chateau Rouge;) had picked\r\nup a _coupé_, looked in for me at two or three places where he thought\r\nme most likely to be at that hour in the evening, and had found me at\r\nVery's, as related. What the sorceress could possibly want of me, he had\r\nno idea more than myself; but he reminded me that she had hinted at the\r\npossible necessity of sending for me at no distant period, and I\r\nremembered the fact too well to need the reminder.\r\n\r\n'It was nearly midnight when we drove down the Rue St. Denis, turned\r\ninto La Reynie Ogniard, and drew up at the antiquated door I had once\r\nentered nearly three months earlier. We entered as before, rang the bell\r\nas before, and were admitted into the inner room by the same slattern\r\ngirl. I remember at this moment one impression which this person made\r\nupon me--that she did not wash so often as four times a year, and that\r\nthe _same old dirt_ was upon her face that had been crusted there at the\r\ntime of my previous visit. There seemed no change in the room, except\r\nthat _two_ tapers, and each larger than the one I had previously seen,\r\nwere burning upon the table. The curtain was down, as before, and when\r\nit suddenly rose, after a few minutes spent in waiting, and the\r\nblood-red woman stood in the vacant space, all seemed so exactly as it\r\nhad done on the previous visit, that it would have been no difficult\r\nmatter to believe the past three months a mere imagination, and this the\r\nsame first visit renewed.\r\n\r\n'The illusion, such as it was, did not last long, however. The sorceress\r\nfixed her eyes full upon me, with the red flame seeming to play through\r\nthe eyeballs as it had before done through her cheeks, and said, in a\r\nvoice lower, more sad and broken, than it had been when addressing me on\r\nthe previous occasion:\r\n\r\n''Young American, I have sent for you, and you have done well to come.\r\nDo not fear----'\r\n\r\n''I do _not_ fear--you, or any one!' I answered, a little piqued that\r\nshe should have drawn any such impression from my appearance. I may have\r\nbeen uttering a fib of magnificent proportions at the moment, but one\r\nhas a right to deny cowardice to the last gasp, whatever else he must\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\n''You do not? It is well, then!' she said in reply, and in the same low,\r\nsad voice. 'You will have courage, then, perhaps, to see what I will\r\nshow you from the land of shadows.'\r\n\r\n''Whom does it concern?' I asked. 'Myself, or some other?'\r\n\r\n''Yourself, and many others--all the world!' uttered the lips of flame.\r\n'It is of your country that I would show you.'\r\n\r\n''My country? God of heaven! What has happened to my country?' broke\r\nfrom my lips almost before I knew what I was uttering. I suppose the\r\nwords came almost like a groan, for I had been deeply anxious over the\r\nstate of affairs known to exist at home, and perhaps I can be nearer to\r\na weeping child when I think of any ill to my own beloved land, than I\r\ncould be for any other evil threatened in the world.\r\n\r\n''But a moment more and you shall see!' said the sorceress. Then she\r\nadded: 'You have a friend here present. Shall he too look on what I have\r\nto reveal, or will you behold it alone?'\r\n\r\n''Let him see!' I answered. 'My native land may fall into ruin, but she\r\ncan never be ashamed!'\r\n\r\n''So let it be, then!' said the sorceress, solemnly. 'Be silent, look,\r\nand learn what is at this moment transpiring in your own land!'\r\n\r\n'Beneath that adjuration I was silent, and the same dread stillness fell\r\nupon my companion. Suddenly the sorceress, still standing in the same\r\nplace, waved her right hand in the air, and a strain of low, sad music,\r\nsuch as the harps of angels may be continually making over the descent\r\nof lost spirits to the pit of suffering, broke upon my ears. Von Berg\r\ntoo heard it, I know, for I saw him look up in surprise, then apply his\r\nfingers to his ears and test whether his sense of hearing had suddenly\r\nbecome defective. Whence that strain of music could have sprung I did\r\nnot know, nor do I know any better at this moment. I only know that, to\r\nmy senses and those of my companion, it was definite as if the thunders\r\nof the sky had been ringing.\r\n\r\n'Then came another change, quite as startling as the music and even more\r\ndifficult to explain. The room began to fill with a whitish mist,\r\ntransparent in its obscurity, that wrapped the form of the sybil and\r\nfinally enveloped her until she appeared to be but a shade. Anon another\r\nand larger room seemed to grow in the midst, with columned galleries and\r\na rostrum, and hundreds of forms in wild commotion, moving to and fro,\r\nthough uttering no sound. At one moment it seemed that I could look\r\nthrough one of the windows of the phantom building, and I saw the\r\nbranches of a palmetto-tree waving in the winter wind. Then amidst and\r\napparently at the head of all, a white-haired man stood upon the\r\nrostrum, and as he turned down a long scroll from which he seemed to be\r\nreading to the assemblage, I read the words that appeared on the top of\r\nthe scroll: 'An ordinance to dissolve the compact heretofore existing\r\nbetween the several States of the Federal Union, under the name of the\r\nUnited States of America.' My breath came thick, my eyes filled with\r\ntears of wonder and dismay, and I could see no more.\r\n\r\n''Horror!' I cried. 'Roll away the vision, for it is false! It can not\r\nbe that the man lives who could draw an ordinance to dissolve the Union\r\nof the United States of America!'\r\n\r\n''It is so! That has this day been done!' spoke the voice of the\r\nsorceress from within the cloud of white mist.\r\n\r\n''If this is indeed true,' I said, 'show me what is the result, for the\r\nheavens must bow if this work of ruin is accomplished!'\r\n\r\n''Look again, then!' said the voice. The strain of music, which had\r\npartially ceased for a moment, grew louder and sadder again, and I saw\r\nthe white mist rolling and changing as if a wind were stirring it.\r\nGradually again it assumed shape and form; and in the moonlight, before\r\nthe Capitol of the nation, its white proportions gleaming in the wintry\r\nray, the form of Washington stood, the hands clasped, the head bare,\r\nand the eyes cast upward in the mute agony of supplication.\r\n\r\n''All is not lost!' I shouted more than spoke, 'for the Father of his\r\nCountry still watches his children, and while he lives in the heavens\r\nand prays for the erring and wandering, the nation may yet be\r\nreclaimed.'\r\n\r\n''It may be so,' said the voice through the mist, 'for look!'\r\n\r\n'Again the strain of music sounded, but now louder and clearer and\r\nwithout the tone of hopeless sadness. Again the white mists rolled by in\r\nchanging forms, and when once more they assumed shape and consistency I\r\nsaw great masses of men, apparently in the streets of a large city,\r\nthrowing out the old flag from roof and steeple, lifting it to heaven in\r\nattitudes of devotion, and pressing it to their lips with those wild\r\nkisses which a mother gives to her darling child when it has been just\r\nrescued from a deadly peril.\r\n\r\n''The nation lives!' I shouted. 'The old flag is not deserted and the\r\npatriotic heart yet beats in American bosoms! Show me yet more, for the\r\nnext must be triumph!'\r\n\r\n''Triumph indeed!' said the voice. 'Behold it and rejoice at it while\r\nthere is time!' I shuddered at the closing words, but another change in\r\nthe strain of music roused me. It was not sadness now, nor yet the\r\nrising voice of hope, for martial music rung loudly and clearly, and\r\nthrough it I heard the roar of cannon and the cries of combatants in\r\nbattle. As the vision cleared, I saw the armies of the Union in tight\r\nwith a host almost as numerous as themselves, but savage, ragged, and\r\ntumultuous, and bearing a mongrel flag that I had never seen before--one\r\nthat seemed robbed from the banner of the nation's glory. For a moment\r\nthe battle wavered and the forces of the Union seemed driven backward;\r\nthen they rallied with a shout, and the flag of stars and stripes was\r\nrebaptized in glory. They pressed the traitors backward at every\r\nturn--they trod rebellion under their heels--they were every where, and\r\nevery where triumphant.\r\n\r\n''Three cheers for the Star-Spangled Banner!' I cried, forgetting place\r\nand time in the excitement of the scene. 'Let the world look on and\r\nwonder and admire! I knew the land that the Fathers founded and\r\nWashington guarded could not die! Three cheers--yes, nine--for the\r\nStar-Spangled Banner and the brave old land over which it floats!'\r\n\r\n''Pause!' said the voice, coming out once more from the cloud of white\r\nmist, and chilling my very marrow with the sad solemnity of its tone.\r\n'Look once again!' I looked, and the mists went rolling by as before,\r\nwhile the music changed to wild discord; and when the sight became clear\r\nagain I saw the men of the nation struggling over bags of gold and\r\nquarreling for a black shadow that flitted about in their midst, while\r\ncries of want and wails of despair went up and sickened the heavens! I\r\nclosed my eyes and tried to close my ears, but I could not shut out the\r\nvoice of the sorceress, saying once more from her shroud of white mist:\r\n\r\n''Look yet again, and for the last time! Behold the worm that gnaws away\r\nthe bravery of a nation and makes it a prey for the spoiler!'\r\nHeart-brokenly sad was the music now, as the vision changed once more,\r\nand I saw a great crowd of men, each in the uniform of an officer of the\r\nUnited States army, clustered around one who seemed to be their chief.\r\nBut while I looked I saw one by one totter and fall, and directly I\r\nperceived that _the epaulette or shoulder-strap on the shoulder of each\r\nwas a great hideous yellow worm, that gnawed away the shoulder and\r\npalsied the arm and ate into the vitals_. Every second, one fell and\r\ndied, making frantic efforts to tear away the reptile from its grasp,\r\nbut in vain. Then the white mists rolled away, and I saw the strange\r\nwoman standing where she had been when the first vision began. She was\r\nsilent, the music was hushed, Adolph Von Berg had fallen hack asleep in\r\nhis chair, and drawing out my watch, I discovered that only ten minutes\r\nhad elapsed since the sorceress spoke her first word.\r\n\r\n''You have seen all--go!' was her first and last interruption to the\r\nsilence. The instant after, the curtain fell. I kicked Von Berg to awake\r\nhim, and we left the house. The _coupé_ was waiting in the street and\r\nset me down at my lodgings, after which it conveyed my companion to his.\r\nAdolph did not seem to have a very clear idea of what had occurred, and\r\nmy impression is, that he went to sleep the moment the first strain of\r\nmusic commenced.\r\n\r\n'As for myself, I am not much clearer than Adolph as to how and why I\r\nsaw and heard what I know that I did see and hear. I can only say that\r\non that night of the twentieth December, 1860, the same on which, as it\r\nafterward appeared, the ordinance of secession was adopted at\r\nCharleston, I, in the little old two-story house in the Rue la Reynie\r\nOgniard, witnessed what I have related. What may be the omens, you may\r\njudge as well as myself. How much of the sybil's prophecy is already\r\nhistory, you know already. That SHOULDER-STRAPS, which I take to be _the\r\ndesire of military show without courage or patriotism_, are destroying\r\nthe armies of the republic, I am afraid there is no question. Perhaps\r\nyou can imagine why at the moment of hearing that there was a worm on my\r\nshoulder for a shoulder-strap, I for the instant believed that it was\r\none of the hideous yellow monsters that I saw devouring the best\r\nofficers of the nation, and shrunk and shrieked like a whipped child. Is\r\nnot that a long story?' Martin concluded, lighting a fresh cigar and\r\nthrowing himself back from the table.\r\n\r\n'Very long, and a little mad; but to me absorbingly interesting,' was my\r\nreply, 'And in the hope that it may prove so to others, I shall use it\r\nas a strange, rambling introduction to a recital of romantic events\r\nwhich have occurred in and about the great city since the breaking out\r\nof the rebellion, having to do with patriotism and cowardice, love,\r\nmischief, and secession, and bearing the title thus suggested.'\r\n\r\nA part of which stipulation is hereby kept, with the promise of the\r\nwriter that the remainder shall be faithfully fulfilled in forthcoming\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.\r\n\r\n  Tell us--poor gray-haired children that we are--\r\n  Tell us some story of the days afar,\r\n  Down shining through the years like sun and star.\r\n\r\n  The stories that, when we were very young,\r\n  Like golden beads on lips of wisdom hung,\r\n  At fireside told or by the cradle sung.\r\n\r\n  Not Cinderella with the tiny shoe,\r\n  Nor Harsan's carpet that through distance flew,\r\n  Nor Jack the Giant-Killer's derring-do.\r\n\r\n  Not even the little lady of the Hood,\r\n  But something sadder--easier understood--\r\n  The ballad of the Children in the Wood.\r\n\r\n  Poor babes! the cruel uncle lives again,\r\n  To whom their little voices plead in vain--\r\n  Who sent them forth to be by ruffians slain.\r\n\r\n  The hapless agent of the guilt is here--\r\n  From whose seared heart their pleading brought a tear--\r\n  Who could not strike, but fled away in fear.\r\n\r\n  And hand in hand the wanderers, left alone,\r\n  Through the dense forest make their feeble moan,\r\n  Fed on the berries--pillowed on a stone.\r\n\r\n  Still hand in hand, till little feet grow sore,\r\n  And fails the feeble strength their limbs that bore;\r\n  Then they lie down, and feel the pangs no more.\r\n\r\n  The stars shine down in pity from the sky;\r\n  The night-bird marks their fate with plaintive cry;\r\n  The dew-drop wets their parched lips ere they die.\r\n\r\n  There clasped they lie--death's poor, unripened sheaves--\r\n  Till the red robin through the tree-top grieves,\r\n  And flutters down and covers them with leaves.\r\n\r\n  'Tis an old legend, and a touching one:\r\n  What then? Methinks beneath to-morrow's sun\r\n  Some deed as heartless will be planned and done.\r\n\r\n  Children of older years and sadder fate\r\n  Will wander, outcasts, from the great world's gate,\r\n  And ne'er return again, though long they wait.\r\n\r\n  Through wildering labyrinths that round them close,\r\n  In that heart-hunger disappointment knows,\r\n  They long may wander ere the night's repose.\r\n\r\n  Their feeble voices through the dusk may call,\r\n  And on the ears of busy mortals fall,\r\n  But who will hear, save God above us all?\r\n\r\n  Will wolfish Hates forego their evil work,\r\n  Nor Envy's vultures in the branches perk,\r\n  Nor Slander's snakes within the verdure lurk?\r\n\r\n  And when at last the torch of life grows dim,\r\n  Shall sweet birds o'er them chant a burial-hymn,\r\n  Or decent pity veil the stiffening limb?\r\n\r\n  Thrice happy they, if the old legend stand,\r\n  And they are left to wander hand in hand--\r\n  Not driven apart by Eden's blazing brand!\r\n\r\n  If, long before the lonely night comes on--\r\n  By tempting berries wildered and withdrawn--\r\n  One does not look and find the other gone;\r\n\r\n  If something more of shame, and grief, and wrong\r\n  Than that so often told in nursery song,\r\n  To their sad history does not belong!\r\n\r\n  O lonely wanderers in the great world's wood!\r\n  Finding the evil where you seek the good,\r\n  Often deceived and seldom understood--\r\n\r\n  Lay to your hearts the plaintive tale of old,\r\n  When skies grow threatening or when loves grow cold,\r\n  Or something dear is hid beneath the mold!\r\n\r\n  For fates are hard, and hearts are very weak,\r\n  And roses we have kissed soon leave the cheek,\r\n  And what we are, we scarcely dare to speak.\r\n\r\n  But something deeper, to reflective eyes,\r\n  To-day beneath the sad old story lies,\r\n  And all must read if they are truly wise.\r\n\r\n  A nation wanders in the deep, dark night,\r\n  By cruel hands despoiled of half its might,\r\n  And half its truest spirits sick with fright.\r\n\r\n  The world is step-dame--scoffing at the strife,\r\n  And black assassins, armed with deadly knife,\r\n  At every step lurk, striking at its life.\r\n\r\n  Shall it be murdered in the gloomy wood?\r\n  Tell us, O Parent of the True and Good,\r\n  Whose hand for us the fate has yet withstood!\r\n\r\n  Shall it lie down at last, all weak and faint,\r\n  Its blood dried up with treason's fever-taint,\r\n  And offer up its soul in said complaint?\r\n\r\n  Or shall the omen fail, and, rooting out\r\n  All that has marked its life with fear and doubt,\r\n  The child spring up to manhood with a shout?\r\n\r\n  So that in other days, when far and wide\r\n  Other lost children have for succor cried,\r\n  The one now periled may be help and guide?\r\n\r\n  Father of all the nations formed of men,\r\n  So let it be! Hold us beneath thy ken,\r\n  And bring the wanderers to thyself again!\r\n\r\n  Pity us all, and give us strength to pray,\r\n  And lead us gently down our destined way!\r\n  And this is all the children's lips can say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL UNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPride in the physical grandeur, the magnificent proportions of our\r\ncountry, has for generations been the master passion of Americans. Never\r\nhas the popular voice or vote refused to sustain a policy which looked\r\nto the enlargement of the area or increase of the power of the Republic.\r\nTo feel that so vast a river as the Mississippi, having such affluents\r\nas the Missouri and the Ohio, rolled its course entirely through our\r\nterritory--that the twenty thousand miles of steamboat navigation on\r\nthat river and its tributaries were wholly our own, without touching on\r\nany side our national boundaries--that the Pacific and the Atlantic, the\r\ngreat lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, were our natural and conceded\r\nfrontiers, that their bays and harbors were the refuge of our commerce,\r\nand their rising cities our marts and depots--were incense to our vanity\r\nand stimulants to our love of country. No true American abroad ever\r\nregarded or characterized himself as a New-Yorker, a Virginian, a\r\nLouisianian: he dilated in the proud consciousness of his country's\r\ntranscendent growth and wondrous greatness, and confidently anticipated\r\nthe day when its flag should float unchallenged from Hudson's Bay to the\r\nIsthmus of Darien, if not to Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nIt was this strong instinct of Nationality which rendered the masses so\r\nlong tolerant, if not complaisant, toward Slavery and the Slave Power.\r\nMerchants and bankers were bound to their footstool by other and\r\nignobler ties; but the yeomanry of the land regarded slavery with a\r\nlenient if not absolutely favoring eye, because it existed in fifteen of\r\nour States, and was cherished as of vital moment by nearly all of them,\r\nso that any popular aversion to it evinced by the North, would tend to\r\nweaken the bonds of our Union. It might _seem_ hard to Pomp, or Sambo,\r\nor Cuffee, to toil all day in the rice-swamp, the cotton-field, to the\r\nmusic of the driver's lash, with no hope of remuneration or release, nor\r\neven of working out thereby a happier destiny for his children; but\r\nafter all, what was the happiness or misery of three or four millions of\r\nstupid, brutish negroes, that it should be allowed to weigh down the\r\ngreatness and glory of the Model Republic? Must there not always be a\r\nfoundation to every grand and towering structure? Must not some grovel\r\nthat others may soar? Is not _all_ drudgery repulsive? Yet must it not\r\nbe performed? Are not negroes habitually enslaved by each other in\r\nAfrica? Does not their enslavement here secure an aggregate of labor and\r\nproduction that would else be unattainable? Are we not enabled by it to\r\nsupply the world with Cotton and Tobacco and ourselves with Rice and\r\nSugar? In short, is not to toil on white men's plantations the negro's\r\ntrue destiny, and Slavery the condition wherein he contributes most\r\nsensibly, considerably, surely, to the general sustenance and comfort of\r\nmankind? If it is, away with all your rigmarole declarations of 'the\r\ninalienable Rights of Man'--the right of every one to life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness! Let us have a reformed and rationalized\r\npolitical Bible, which shall affirm the equality of all _white_\r\nmen--_their_ inalienable right to liberty, etc., etc. Thus will our\r\nconsistency be maintained, our institutions and usages stand justified,\r\nwhile we still luxuriate on our home-grown sugar and rice, and deluge\r\nthe civilized world with our cheap cotton and tobacco!--And thus our\r\ncountry--which had claimed a place in the family of nations as the\r\nlegitimate child and foremost champion of Human Freedom--was fast\r\nsinking into the loathsome attitude of foremost champion and most\r\nconspicuous exemplar of the vilest and most iniquitous form of\r\nDespotism--that which robs the laborer of the just recompense of his\r\nsweat, and dooms him to a life of ignorance, squalor, and despair.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n  'The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\r\n  Make whips to scourge us.'\r\n\r\nFor two generations our people have cherished, justified, and pampered\r\nslavery, not that they really loved, or conscientiously approved the\r\naccursed 'institution,' but because they deemed its tolerance essential\r\nto our National Unity; and now we find Slavery desperately intent on and\r\nformidably armed for the destruction of that Unity: for two generations\r\nwe have aided the master to trample on and rob his despised slave; and\r\nnow we are about to call that slave to defend our National Unity against\r\nthat master's malignant treason, or submit to see our country shattered\r\nand undone.\r\n\r\nWho can longer fail to realize that 'there is a God who judgeth in the\r\nearth?' or, if the phraseology suit him better, that there is, in the\r\nconstitution of the universe, provision made for the banishment of every\r\ninjustice, the redress of every wrong?\r\n\r\n'Well,' says a late convert to the fundamental truth, 'we must drive the\r\nnegro race entirely from our country, or we shall never again have union\r\nand lasting peace.'\r\n\r\nAh! friend? it is not the negro _per se_ who distracts and threatens to\r\ndestroy our country--far from it! Negroes did not wrest Texas from\r\nMexico, nor force her into the Union, nor threaten rebellion because\r\nCalifornia was admitted as a Free State, nor pass the Nebraska bill, nor\r\nstuff the ballot-boxes and burn the habitations of Kansas, nor fire on\r\nFort Sumter, nor do any thing else whereby our country has been\r\nconvulsed and brought to the brink of ruin. It is not by the negro--it\r\nis by injustice to the negro--that our country has been brought to her\r\npresent deplorable condition. Were Slavery and all its evil brood of\r\nwrongs and vices eradicated this day, the Rebellion would die out\r\nto-morrow and never have a successor. The centripetal tendency of our\r\ncountry is so intense--the attraction of every part for every other so\r\noverwhelming--that Disunion were impossible but for Slavery. What\r\ninsanity in New-Orleans to seek a divorce from the upper waters of her\r\nsuperb river! What a melancholy future must confront St. Louis,\r\nseparated by national barriers from Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado,\r\nNebraska, and all the vast, undeveloped sources of her present as well\r\nas prospective commerce and greatness! Ponder the madness of Baltimore,\r\nseeking separation from that active and teeming West to which she has\r\nlaid an iron track over the Alleghanies at so heavy a cost! But for\r\nSlavery, the Southron who should gravely propose disunion, would at once\r\nbe immured in a receptacle for lunatics. He would find no sympathy\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut a nobler idea, a truer conception, of National Unity, is rapidly\r\ngaining possession of the American mind. It is that dimly foreshadowed\r\nby our President when, in his discussions with Senator Douglas, he said:\r\n'I do not think our country can endure half slave and half free. I do\r\nnot think it will be divided, but I think it will become all one or the\r\nother.'\r\n\r\n'A union of lakes, a union of lands,' is well; but a true 'union of\r\nhearts' must be based on a substantial identity of social habitudes and\r\nmoral convictions. If Islamism or Mormonism were the accepted religion\r\nof the South, and we were expected to bow to and render at least outward\r\ndeference to it, there would doubtless be thousands of Northern-born men\r\nwho, for the sake of office, or trade, or in the hope of marrying\r\nSouthern plantations, would profess the most unbounded faith in the\r\ncreed of the planters, and would crowd their favorite temples located on\r\nour own soil. But this would not be a real bond of union between us, but\r\nmerely an exhibition of servility and fawning hypocrisy. And so the\r\nNorthern complaisance toward slavery has in no degree tended to avert\r\nthe disaster which has overtaken us, but only to breed self-reproach on\r\nthe one side, and hauteur with ineffable loathing on the other.\r\n\r\nHereafter National Unity is to be no roseate fiction, no gainful\r\npretense, but a living reality. The United States of the future will be\r\nno constrained alliance of discordant and mutually repellent\r\ncommonwealths, but a true exemplification of 'many in one'--many stars\r\nblended in one common flag--many States combined in one homogeneous\r\nNation. Our Union will be one of bodies not merely, but of souls. The\r\nmerchant of Boston or New-York will visit Richmond or Louisville for\r\ntobacco, Charleston for rice, Mobile for cotton, New-Orleans for sugar,\r\nwithout being required at every hospitable board, in every friendly\r\ncircle, to repudiate the fundamental laws of right and wrong as he\r\nlearned them from his mother's lips, his father's Bible, and pronounce\r\nthe abject enslavement of a race to the interests and caprices of\r\nanother essentially just and universally beneficent. That a Northern man\r\nvisiting the South commercially should suppress his convictions adverse\r\nto 'the peculiar institution,' and profess to regard it with approval\r\nand satisfaction, was a part of the common law of trade--if one were\r\nhostile to Slavery, what right had he to be currying favor with planters\r\nand their factors, and seeking gain from the products of slave-labor? So\r\nqueried 'the South;' and, if any answer were possible, that answer would\r\nnot be heard. 'Love slavery or quit the South,' was the inexorable rule;\r\nand the resulting hypocrisy has wrought deep injury to the Northern\r\ncharacter. As manufacturers, as traders, as teachers, as clerks, as\r\npolitical aspirants, most of our active, enterprising, leading classes\r\nhave been suitors in some form for Southern favor, and the consequence\r\nhas been a prevalent deference to Southern ideas and a constant\r\nsacrifice of moral convictions to hopes of material advantage.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased God to bring this demoralizing commerce to a sudden and\r\nsanguinary close. Henceforth North and South will meet as equals,\r\nneither finding or fancying in their intimate relations any reason for\r\nimposing a profession of faith on the other. The Southron visiting the\r\nNorth and finding here any law, usage, or institution revolting to his\r\nsense of justice, will never dream of offending by frankly avowing and\r\njustifying the impression it has made upon him: and so with the Northman\r\nvisiting the South. It is conscious wrong alone that shrinks from\r\nimpartial observation and repels unfavorable criticism as hostility. We\r\nfreely proffer our farms, our factories, our warehouses, common-schools,\r\nalms-houses, inns, and whatever else may be deemed peculiar among us, to\r\nour visitors' scrutiny and comment: we know they are not perfect, and\r\nwelcome any hint that may conduce to their improvement. So in the broad,\r\nfree West. The South alone resents any criticism on her peculiarities,\r\nand repels as enmity any attempt to convince her that her forced labor\r\nis her vital weakness and her greatest peril.\r\n\r\nThis is about to pass away. Slavery, having appealed to the sword for\r\njustification, is to be condemned at her chosen tribunal and to fall on\r\nthe weapon she has aimed at the heart of the Republic. A new relation of\r\nNorth to South, based on equality, governed by justice, and conceding\r\nthe fullest liberty, is to replace fawning servility by manly candor,\r\nand to lay the foundations of a sincere, mutual, and lasting esteem. We\r\nalready know that valor is an American quality; we shall yet realize\r\nthat Truth is every man's interest, and that whatever repels scrutiny\r\nconfesses itself unfit to live. The Union of the future, being based on\r\neternal verities, will be cemented by every year's duration, until we\r\nshall come in truth to 'know no North, no South, no East, no West,' but\r\none vast and glorious country, wherein sectional jealousies and hatreds\r\nshall be unknown, and every one shall rejoice in the consciousness that\r\nhe is a son and citizen of the first of Republics, the land of\r\nWashington and Jefferson, of Adams, Hamilton, and Jay, wherein the\r\ninalienable Rights of Man as Man, at first propounded as the logical\r\njustification of a struggle for Independence, became in the next\r\ncentury, and through the influence of another great convulsion, the\r\npractical basis of the entire political and social fabric--the accepted,\r\naxiomatic root of the National life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n    'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Everyone _lives_ it--to\r\n    not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n    interesting.'--_Goethe_.\r\n\r\n    'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n    intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nHIRAM MEEKER VISITS MR. BURNS\r\n\r\nMr. Burns had finished his breakfast.\r\n\r\nA horse and wagon, as was customary at that hour, stood outside the\r\ngate. He himself was on the portico where his daughter had followed him\r\nto give her father his usual kiss. At that moment Mr. Burns saw some one\r\ncrossing the street toward his place. As he was anxious not to be\r\ndetained, he hastened down the walk, so that if he could not escape the\r\nstranger, the person might at least understand that he had prior\r\nengagements. Besides, Mr. Burns never transacted business at home, and a\r\nvisitor at so early an hour must have business for an excuse. The\r\nnew-comer evidently was as anxious to reach the house before Mr. Burns\r\nleft it, as the latter was to make his escape, for pausing a moment\r\nacross the way, as if to make certain, the sight of the young lady\r\nappeared to reassure him, and he walked over and had laid his hand upon\r\nthe gate just as Mr. Burns was attempting to pass out.\r\n\r\nStanding on opposite sides, each with a hand upon the paling, the two\r\nmet. It would have made a good picture. Mr. Burns was at this time a\r\nlittle past forty, but his habit of invariable cheerfulness, his\r\nenergetic manner, and his fine fresh complexion gave him the looks of\r\none between thirty and thirty-five. On the contrary, although Hiram\r\nMeeker was scarcely twenty, and had never had a care nor a thought to\r\nperplex him, he at the same time possessed a certain experienced look\r\nwhich made you doubtful of his age. If one had said he was twenty, you\r\nwould assent to the proposition; if pronounced to be thirty, you would\r\nconsider it near the mark. So, standing as they did, you would perceive\r\nno great disparity in their ages.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to fancy individuals whom we have never seen, but of whom we\r\nhear as accomplishing much, older than they really are. In this instance\r\nHiram had pictured a person at least twenty years older than Mr. Burns\r\nappeared to be. He was quite sure there could be no mistake in the\r\nidentity of the man whom he beheld descending the portico. When he saw\r\nhim at such close quarters he was staggered for a moment, but for a\r\nmoment only. 'It must be he,' so he said to himself.\r\n\r\nNow Hiram had planned his visit with special reference to meeting Mr.\r\nBurns in his own house. He had two reasons for this. He knew that there\r\nhe should find him more at his ease, more off his guard, and in a state\r\nof mind better adapted to considering his case socially and in a\r\nfriendly manner than in the counting-room.\r\n\r\nAgain: Sarah Burns. He would have an opportunity to renew the\r\nacquaintance already begun.\r\n\r\nWell, there they stood. Both felt a little chagrined--Mr. Burns that an\r\nappointment was threatened to be interrupted, and Hiram that his plan\r\nwas in danger of being foiled.\r\n\r\nThis was for an instant only.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns opened the gate passing almost rapidly through, bowing at the\r\nsame time to Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Do you wish to see me?' he said, as he proceeded to untie the horse and\r\nget into the wagon.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Joel Burns, I presume?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'I did wish to see you, sir, on matters of no consequence to you, but\r\npersonal to myself. I can call again.'\r\n\r\n'I am going down to the paper-mill to be absent for an hour. If you will\r\ncome to my office in that time, I shall be at liberty.'\r\n\r\nHiram had a faint hope he would be invited to step into the house and\r\nwait. Disappointed in this, he replied very modestly: 'Perhaps you will\r\npermit me to ride with you--that is, unless some one else is going. I\r\nwould like much to look about the factories.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. Jump in.' And away they drove to Slab City.\r\n\r\nHiram was careful to make no allusion to the subject of his mission to\r\nBurnsville. He remained modestly silent while Mr. Burns occasionally\r\npointed out an important building and explained its use or object.\r\nArriving at the paper-mill, he gave Hiram a brief direction where he\r\nmight spend his time most agreeably.\r\n\r\n'I shall be ready to return in three quarters of an hour,' he said, and\r\ndisappeared inside.\r\n\r\n'I must be careful, and make no mistakes with such a man,' soliloquized\r\nHiram, as he turned to pursue his walk. 'He is quick and rapid--a word\r\nand a blow--too rapid to achieve a GREAT success. It takes a man,\r\nthough, to originate and carry through all this. Every thing flourishes\r\nhere, that is evident. Joel Burns ought to be a richer man than they say\r\nhe is. He has sold too freely, and on too easy terms, I dare say. No\r\ndoubt, come to get into his affairs, there will be ever so much to look\r\nafter. Too much a man of action. Does not think enough. Just the place\r\nfor me for two or three years.'\r\n\r\nHiram had no time for special examination, but strolled about from point\r\nto point, so as to gain a general impression of what was going on. Five\r\nminutes before the time mentioned by Mr. Burns had elapsed, Hiram was at\r\nhis post waiting for him to come out. This little circumstance did not\r\npass unnoticed. It elicited a single observation, 'You are punctual;' to\r\nwhich Hiram made no reply. The drive back to the village was passed\r\nnearly in silence. Mr. Burns's mind was occupied with his affairs, and\r\nHiram thought best not to open his own business till he could have a\r\nfair opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns's place for the transaction of general business was a small\r\none-story brick building, erected expressly for the purpose, and\r\nconveniently located. There was no name on the door, but over it a\r\npretty large sign displayed in gilt letters the word 'Office,' simply.\r\nMr. Burns had some time before discovered this establishment to be a\r\nnecessity, in consequence of the multitude of matters with which he was\r\nconnected. He was the principal partner in the leading store in the\r\nvillage, where a large trade was carried on. The lumber business was\r\nstill good. He had always two or three buildings in course of erection.\r\nHe owned one half the paper-mill. In short, his interests were extensive\r\nand various, but all snug and well-regulated, and under his control. For\r\ngeneral purposes, he spent a certain time in his office. Beyond that, he\r\ncould be found at the store, at the mill, in some of the factories, or\r\nelsewhere, as the occasion called him.\r\n\r\nDriving up to the 'office,' he entered with Hiram, and pointing the\r\nlatter to a seat, took one himself and waited to hear what our hero had\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nHiram opened his case, coming directly to the point. He gave a brief\r\naccount of his previous education and business experience. At the\r\nmention of Benjamin Jessup's name, an ominous 'humph!' escaped Mr.\r\nBurns's lips, which Hiram was not slow to notice. He saw it would prove\r\na disadvantage to have come from his establishment. Without attempting\r\nimmediately to modify the unfavorable impression, he was careful, before\r\nhe finished, to take pains to do so.\r\n\r\n'I have thus explained to you,' concluded Hiram,'that my object is to\r\ngain a full, thorough knowledge of business, with the hope of becoming,\r\nin time, a well-informed and, I trust, successful merchant.'\r\n\r\n'And for that purpose--'\r\n\r\n'For that purpose, I am very desirous to enter your service.'\r\n\r\n'Really, I do not think there is a place vacant which would suit you,\r\nMr. Meeker.'\r\n\r\n'It is of little consequence whether or not the place would suit me,\r\nsir; only let me have the opportunity, and I will endeavor to adapt\r\nmyself to it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! what I mean is, we have at present no situation fitted for a young\r\nman as old and as competent as you appear to be.'\r\n\r\n'But if I were willing to undertake it?'\r\n\r\n'You see there would be no propriety in placing you in a situation\r\nproperly filled by a boy, or at least a youth. Still, I will not forget\r\nyour request; and if occasion should require, you shall have the first\r\nhearing.'\r\n\r\n'I had hoped,' continued Hiram, no way daunted, 'that possibly you might\r\nhave been disposed to take me in your private employ.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'You have large, varied, and increasing interests. You must be severely\r\ntasked, at least at times, to properly manage all. Could I not serve you\r\nas an assistant? You would find me, I think, industrious and\r\npersevering. I bring certificates of character from the Rev. Mr.\r\nGoddard, our clergyman, and from both the deacons in our church.'\r\n\r\nThis was said with a naïve earnestness, coupled with a diffidence\r\napparently _so_ genuine, that Mr. Burns could not but be favorably\r\nimpressed by it. In fact, the idea of a general assistant had never\r\nbefore occurred to him. He reflected a moment, and replied:\r\n\r\n'It is true I have much on my hands, but one who has a great deal to do\r\ncan do a great deal; besides, the duties I undertake it would be\r\nimpossible to devolve on another.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you would give me a trial. The amount of salary would be no\r\nobject. I want to learn business, and I know I can learn it of _you_.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was not insensible to the compliment. His features relaxed\r\ninto a smile, but his opinion remained unchanged.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Hiram, in a pathetic tone, 'I hate to go back and meet\r\nfather. He said he presumed you had forgotten him, though he remembered\r\nyou when you lived in Sudbury, a young man about my age; and he told me\r\nto make an engagement with you, if it were only as errand-boy.'\r\n\r\n[O Hiram! how could that glib and ready lie come so aptly to your lips?\r\nYour father never said a word to you on the subject. It is doubtful if\r\nhe knew you were going to Burnsville at all, and he never had seen Mr.\r\nBurns in his life. How carefully, Hiram, you calculated before you\r\nresolved on this delicate method to secure your object! The risk of the\r\nfalsity of the whole ever being discovered--that was very remote, and\r\namounted to little. What you were about to say would injure no\r\none--wrong no one. If not true, it might well be true. Oh! but Hiram, do\r\nyou not see you are permitting an element of falsehood to creep in and\r\nleaven your whole nature? You are exhibiting an utter disregard of\r\ncircumstances in your determination to carry your point. Heretofore you\r\nhave looked to but one end--self; but you have committed no overt act.\r\nHave a care, Hiram Meeker; Satan is gaining on you.]\r\n\r\nMr. Burns had not been favorably impressed, at first sight, with his\r\nvisitor. Magnetically he was repelled by him. He was too just a man to\r\nallow this to influence him, by word or manner. He permitted Hiram to\r\naccompany him to the mill and return with him.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the latter had learned something of his man. He saw\r\nquickly enough that he had failed favorably to impress Mr. Burns.\r\nDetermining not to lose the day, he assumed an entire ingenuousness of\r\ncharacter, coupled with much simplicity and earnestness. He appealed to\r\nthe certificates of his minister and the deacons, as if these would be\r\nsure to settle the question irrespective of Mr. Burns's wants; and at\r\nlast the _lie_ slipped from his mouth, in appearance as innocently as\r\ntruth from the lips of an angel.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Sudbury and the time when he was a young man, Hiram,\r\nwho watched narrowly, thought he could perceive a slight quickening in\r\nthe eye of Mr. Burns--nothing more.\r\n\r\nHis only reply, however, to the appeal, was to ask:\r\n\r\n'How old are you?'\r\n\r\n'Nineteen,' said Hiram softly. (He would be twenty the following week,\r\nbut he did not say so.)\r\n\r\n'Only nineteen!' exclaimed Mr. Burns, 'I took you for five-and-twenty.'\r\n\r\n'It is very singular,' replied Hiram mournfully; 'I am not aware that\r\npersons generally think me older than I am.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! I presume not; and now I look closer, I do not think you _do_\r\nappear more than nineteen.'\r\n\r\nIt was really astonishing how Hiram's countenance had changed. How every\r\ntrace of keen, shrewd apprehension had vanished, leaving only the\r\nappearance of a highly intelligent and interesting, but almost diffident\r\nyouth!\r\n\r\nMr. Burns sat a moment without speaking. Hiram did not dare utter a\r\nword. He knew he was dealing with a man quick in his impressions and\r\nrapid to decide. He had done his best, and would not venture farther.\r\nMr. Burns, looking up from a reflective posture, cast his eyes on Hiram.\r\nThe latter really appeared so amazingly distressed that Mr. Burns's\r\nfeelings were touched.\r\n\r\n'Is your mother living,' he asked.\r\n\r\nHiram was almost on the point of denying the fact, but that would have\r\nbeen too much.\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes, sir,' he replied.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Burns was silent. Again Hiram calculated the chances, and\r\nwould not venture to interrupt him.\r\n\r\nThis time Mr. Burns's thoughts took another direction. It occurred to\r\nhim that he had of late overtasked his daughter. 'True, it is a great\r\nsource of pleasure for us both that she can be of so much assistance to\r\nme, but her duties naturally accumulate; she is doing too much. It is\r\nnot appropriate.'\r\n\r\nSo thought Mr. Burns while Hiram Meeker sat waiting for a decision.\r\n\r\n'It is true,' continued Mr. Burns to himself, 'I think I ought to have a\r\nprivate clerk. The idea occurred even to this youth. I will investigate\r\nwho and what he is, and will give him a trial if all is right.'\r\n\r\nHe turned toward Hiram:\r\n\r\n'Young man, I am inclined to favor your request. But if I give you\r\nemployment in my _office_, your relations with me will necessarily be\r\nconfidential, and the situation will be one of trust and confidence. I\r\nmust make careful inquiries.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir,' replied Hiram, drawing a long breath, for he saw the\r\nvictory was gained. 'I will leave these certificates, which may aid you\r\nin your inquiries. I was born and brought up in Hampton, and you will\r\nhave no difficulty in finding persons who know my parents and me. When\r\nshall I call again, sir?'\r\n\r\n'In a week.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Won! won! yes, won!' exclaimed Hiram aloud, when he had walked a\r\nsufficient distance from the 'office' to enable him to do so without\r\ndanger of being overheard. 'A close shave, though! If he had said 'No,'\r\nall Hampton would not have moved him. What a splendid place for me! How\r\ndid I come to be smart enough to suggest such a thing to him? I rather\r\nthink three years here will make me all right for New-York.'\r\n\r\nHiram walked along to the hotel, and ordered dinner. While it was\r\ngetting ready, he strolled over the village. He was in hopes to meet, by\r\nsome accident, Miss Burns.\r\n\r\nHe was not disappointed. Turning a corner, he came suddenly on Sarah,\r\nwho had run out for a call on some friend. Hiram fancied he had produced\r\na decided impression the evening they met at Mrs. Crofts', and with a\r\nslight fluttering at the heart, he was about to stop and extend his\r\nhand, when Miss Burns, hardly appearing to recognize him, only bowed\r\nslightly and passed on her way.\r\n\r\n'You shall pay for this, young lady,' muttered Hiram between his\r\nteeth--'you shall pay for this, or my name is not Hiram Meeker! I would\r\ncome here now for nothing else but to pull _her_ down!' continued Hiram\r\nsavagely. 'I will let her know whom she has to deal with.'\r\n\r\nHe walked back to the hotel in a state of great irritation. With the\r\nsight of a good dinner, however, this was in a degree dispelled, and\r\nbefore he finished it, his philosophy came to his relief.\r\n\r\n'Time--time--it takes time. The fact is, I shall like the girl all the\r\nbetter for her playing _off_ at first. Shan't forget it though--not\r\nquite!'\r\n\r\nHe drove back to Hampton that afternoon. His feelings were placid and\r\ncomplacent as usual. He had asked the Lord in the morning to prosper his\r\njourney and to grant him success in gaining his object, and he now\r\nreturned thanks for this new mark of God's grace and favor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Burns did not inquire of the Rev. Mr. Goddard, nor of either of the\r\ndeacons mentioned by Hiram. He wrote direct to Thaddeus Smith, Senior,\r\nwhom he knew, and who he thought would be able to give a correct account\r\nof Hiram. Informing Mr. Smith that the young man had applied to him for\r\na situation of considerable trust, he asked that gentleman to give his\r\ncareful opinion about his capacity, integrity, and general character. As\r\nthere could be but one opinion on the subject in all Hampton, Mr. Smith\r\nreturned an answer every way favorable. It is true he did not like Hiram\r\nhimself, but if called on for a reason, he could not have told why. As\r\nwe have recorded, every one spoke well of him. Every one said how good,\r\nand moral, and smart he was, and honest Mr. Smith reported accordingly.\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' said Mr. Burns, 'if Smith gives such an account of him\r\nwhile he has been all the time in an opposition store, he must be all\r\nright.... Don't quite like his looks, though ... wonder what it is.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen at the expiration of the week Hiram went to receive an answer from\r\nMr. Burns, he did not attempt to find him at his house. He was careful\r\nto call at the office at the hour Mr. Burns was certain to be in.\r\n\r\n'I hear a good account of you, Meeker,' said Mr. Burns, 'and in that\r\nrespect every thing is satisfactory. Had I not given you so much\r\nencouragement, I should still hesitate about making a new department.\r\nHowever, we will try it.'\r\n\r\n'I am very thankful to you, sir. As I said, I want to learn business and\r\nthe compensation is no object.'\r\n\r\n'But it _is_ an object with me. I can have no one in my service who is\r\nnot fully paid. Your position should entitle you to a liberal salary. If\r\nyou can not earn it, you can not fill the place.'\r\n\r\n'Then I shall try to earn it, I assure you,' replied Hiram, 'and will\r\nleave the matter entirely with you. I have brought you a line from my\r\nfather,' he continued, and he handed Mr. Burns a letter.\r\n\r\nIt contained a request, prepared at Hiram's suggestion, that Mr. Burns\r\nwould admit him in his family. The other ran his eye hastily over it. A\r\nslight frown contracted his brow.\r\n\r\n'Impossible!' he exclaimed. 'My domestic arrangements will not permit of\r\nsuch a thing. Quite impossible.'\r\n\r\n'So I told father, but he said it would do no harm to write. He did not\r\nthink you would be offended.'\r\n\r\n'Offended! certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' continued Hiram, 'you will be kind enough to recommend a good\r\nplace to me. I should wish to reside in a religious family, where no\r\nother boarders are taken.'\r\n\r\nThe desire was a proper one, but Hiram's tone did not have the ring of\r\nthe true metal. It grated slightly on Mr. Burns's moral nerves--a little\r\nof his first aversion came back--but he suppressed it, and promised to\r\nendeavor to think of a place which should meet Hiram's wishes. It was\r\nnow Saturday. It was understood Hiram should commence his duties the\r\nfollowing Monday. This arranged, he took leave of his employer, and\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nThat evening Mr. Burns told his daughter he was about to relieve her\r\nfrom the drudgery--daily increasing--of copying letters and taking care\r\nof so many papers, by employing a confidential clerk. Sarah at first was\r\ngrieved; but when her father declared he should talk with her just as\r\never about every thing he did or proposed to do, and that he thought in\r\nthe end the new clerk would be a great relief to him, she was content.\r\n\r\n'But whom have you got, father,' (she always called him 'father,') 'for\r\nso important a situation?'\r\n\r\n'His name is Meeker--Hiram Meeker--a young man very highly recommended\r\nto me from Hampton.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder if it was not he whom I met last Saturday!'\r\n\r\n'Possibly; he called on me that day. Do you know him?'\r\n\r\n'I presume it is the same person I saw at Mrs. Crofts' some weeks since.\r\nLast Saturday a young man met me and almost stopped, as if about to\r\nspeak. I did not recognize him, although I could not well avoid bowing.\r\nNow I feel quite sure it was Mr. Meeker.'\r\n\r\n'Very likely.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I do hope he will prove faithful and efficient. I recollect every\r\none spoke very highly of him.'\r\n\r\n'I dare say.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was in a reverie. Certain thoughts were passing through his\r\nmind--painful, unhappy thoughts--thoughts which had never before visited\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Sarah, how old are you?'\r\n\r\n'Why, father, what a question!' She came and sat on his knee and looked\r\nfondly into his eyes. 'What _can_ you be thinking of not to remember I\r\nam seventeen?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I remember it, dear child,' replied Mr. Burns tenderly; 'my\r\nmind was wandering, and I spoke without reflection.'\r\n\r\n'But you were thinking of me?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps.'\r\n\r\nHe kissed her, and rose and walked slowly up and down the room. Still he\r\nwas troubled.\r\n\r\nWe shall not at present endeavor to penetrate his thoughts; nor is it\r\njust now to our purpose to present them to the reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker had been again _successful_. He had resolved to enter the\r\nservice of Mr. Burns and he _had_ entered it. He came over Monday\r\nmorning early, and put up at the hotel. In three or four days he secured\r\njust the kind of boarding-place he was in search of. A very respectable\r\nwidow lady, with two grown-up daughters, after consulting with Mr.\r\nBurns, did not object to receive him as a member of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARMY CONTRACTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lived a man of iron mold,\r\n    Crafty glance and hidden eye,\r\n  Dead to every gain but gold,\r\n    Deaf to every human sigh.\r\n  Man he was of hoary beard,\r\n    Withered cheek and wrinkled brow.\r\n  Imaged on his soul, appeared:\r\n    'Honest as the times allow.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WHY PAUL FERROLL KILLED HIS WIFE. By the Author of Paul\r\n     Ferroll. New-York: Carleton, 413 Broadway. Boston: N. Williams &\r\n     Co.\r\n\r\nThose who remember _Paul Ferroll_, probably recall it as a novel of\r\nmerit, which excited attention, partly from its peculiarity, and partly\r\nfrom the mystery in which its writer chose to conceal herself--a not\r\nunusual course with timid debutantes in literature, who hope either to\r\n_intriguer_ the public with their masks, or quietly escape the disgrace\r\nof a _fiasco_ should they fail. Mrs. Clive is, however, it would seem,\r\nsatisfied that the public did not reject her, since she now reäppears to\r\ninform us, 'novelly,' why the extremely ill-married Paul made himself\r\nthe chief of sinners, by committing wife-icide. The work is in fact a\r\nvery readable novel--much less killing indeed than its title--but still\r\ndeserving the great run which we are informed it is having, and which,\r\nunlike the run of shad, will not we presume--as it is a very summer\r\nbook--fall off as the season advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE CHANNINGS. A Domestic Novel of Real Life. By Mrs.\r\n     Henry Wood. Philadelphia: T. B. Peterson. Boston: Crosby and\r\n     Nichols.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the praise which has been so lavishly bestowed on this\r\n'tale of domestic life,' the reader will, if any thing more than a mere\r\nreader of novels for the very sake of 'story,' probably agree with us,\r\nafter dragging through to the end, that it would be a blessing if some\r\nmanner of stop could be put to the manufacture of such books. A really\r\n_original_, earnest novel; vivid in its life-picturing, genial in its\r\ncharacters; the book of a man or woman who has thought something, and\r\nactually _knows_ something, is at any time a world's blessing. But what\r\nhas _The Channings_ of all this in it? Every sentence in it rings like\r\nsomething read of old, all the incidents are of a kind which were worn\r\nout years ago--to be sure the third-rate story-reader may lose himself\r\nin it--just as we may for a fiftieth time endeavor to trace out the plan\r\nof the Hampton Labyrinth, and with about as much real profit or\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy sign of the times to learn that such hackneyed\r\nEnglish trash as _The Channings_ has sold well! It has not deserved it.\r\nAmerican novels which have appeared nearly cotemporaneously with it, and\r\nwhich have ten times its merit, have not met with the same success, for\r\nthe simple and sole reason that almost any English circulating library\r\nstuff will at any time meet with better patronage than a home work. When\r\nour public becomes as much interested in itself as it is in the very\r\ncommon-place life of Cockney clergymen and clerks, we shall perhaps\r\nwitness a truly generous encouragement of native literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE PEARL OF ORR'S ISLAND. A Story of the Coast of Maine.\r\n     By Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nIn reading this quiet, natural, well-pictured narrative of Northern\r\nlife, we are tempted to exclaim--fresh from the extraordinary contrast\r\npresented by _Agnes of Sorrento--O si sic omnes!_ Why can not Mrs. Stowe\r\n_always_ write like this? Why not limit her efforts to subjects which\r\ndevelop her really fine powers--to setting forth the social life of\r\nAmerica at the present day, instead of harping away at the seven times\r\nworn out and knotted cord of Catholic and Italian romance? _The Pearl of\r\nOrr's Island_, though not a work which will sweep Uncle Tom-like in\r\ntempest fashion over all lands and through all languages, is still a\r\nvery readable and very refreshing novel--full of reality as we find it\r\namong real people, 'inland or on sounding shore,' and by no means\r\ndeficient in those moral and religious lessons to inculcate which it\r\nappears to have been written. Piety is indeed the predominant\r\ncharacteristic of the work--not obtrusive or sectarian, but earnest and\r\nactual; so that it will probably be classed, on the whole, as a\r\nreligious novel, though we can hardly recall a romance in which the\r\npious element interferes so little with the general interest of the\r\nplot, or is so little conducive to gloom. The hard, '_Angular_ Saxon'\r\ncharacteristics of the rural people who constitute the _dramatis\r\npersonæ_, their methods of thought and tone of feeling, so singularly\r\ndifferent from that of 'the world,' their marked peculiarities, are all\r\nset forth with an apparently unconscious ability deserving the highest\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE GOLDEN HOUR. By MONOURE D. CONWAY, Author of\r\n     the 'Rejected Stone,' '_Impera Parendo_.' Boston: Ticknor and\r\n     Fields.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable work which the war has called out is beyond question\r\nthe _Rejected Stone_. Wild, vigorous, earnest, even to suffering, honest\r\nas truth itself, quaint, humorous, pathetic, and startlingly eccentric.\r\nThose who read it at once decided that a new writer had arisen among us,\r\nand one destined to make no mean mark in the destinies of his country.\r\nThe reader who will refer to our first number will find what we said of\r\nit in all sincerity, since the author was then to us unknown. He is--it\r\nis almost needless to inform the reader--a thorough-going abolitionist,\r\nyet one who, while looking more intently at the welfare of the black\r\nthan we care to do in the present imbroglio, still appreciates and urges\r\nEmancipation, or freeing the black, in its relation to the welfare of\r\nthe white man. Mr. Conway is not, however, a man who speaks ignorantly\r\non this subject. A Virginian born and bred, brought up in the very heart\r\nof the institution, he studied it at home in all its relations, and\r\nfound out its evils by experience. A thoroughly honest man, too\r\nclear-headed and far too intelligent to be rated as a fanatic; too\r\nfamiliar with his subject to be at all disregarded, he claims close\r\nattention in many ways, those of wit and eloquence not being by any\r\nmeans the least. In the work before us, he insists that there is a\r\ngolden hour at hand, a title borrowed from the quaint advertisement, of\r\n'Lost a golden hour set with sixty diamond minutes'--which if not\r\ngrasped at by the strong, daring hand will see our great national\r\nopportunity lost forever. We are not such disbelievers in fate as to\r\nimagine that this golden hour ever can be inevitably lost. If the cause\r\nof freedom rolls slowly, it is because even in free soil there are too\r\nmany Conservative pebbles. Still we agree with Conway as to his estimate\r\nof the great mass of cowardice, irresolution, and folly which react on\r\nour administration. If the word 'Emancipationist,'--meaning thereby one\r\nwho looks to the welfare of the _white_ man rather than the negro--be\r\nsubstituted for 'Abolitionist' in the following, our more intelligent\r\nreaders will probably agree with Mr. Conway exactly:\r\n\r\n     'If this country is to be saved, the Abolitionists are to save it;\r\n     and though they seem few in numbers, they are not by a thousandth\r\n     so few as were the Christians when JESUS suffered, or Protestants\r\n     when Luther spoke. There is need only that we should stand as one\r\n     man, and unto the end, for an absolutely free Republic, swearing to\r\n     promote eternal strife until it be attained--until in waters which\r\n     Agitation, the angel of freedom, has troubled, the diseased nation\r\n     shall bathe and be made every whit whole.\r\n\r\n     'The Golden Hour is before us: there is in America enough wisdom\r\n     and courage to coin it, ere it passes, into national honor and\r\n     peace, if it is all put forth.\r\n\r\n     'Up, hearts!'\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that we earnestly commend this book to all who\r\nare truly interested in the great questions of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TRAGEDY OF SUCCESS. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nAnother of the extraordinary series bearing the motto, '_Aux plus\r\ndesheritées le plus d'amour_'--works as strongly marked by talent as by\r\nmisapplied taste. The dramatic ability, the deep vein of poetry, the\r\nearnest thought, faith, and humanity of these dramas or drama, are\r\nbeyond question--but very questionable to our mind is the extreme love\r\nof over-adorning truth which can induce a writer to represent plantation\r\nnegroes as speaking elegant language and using lofty, tender, and poetic\r\nsentiments on almost all occasions, or at least to a degree which is\r\nexceptional and not regular. If we hope that the time may come when all\r\nof GOD'S children will be raised to this high standard of\r\nthought and culture, so much the more reason is there why they should\r\nnot now be exaggerated and placed in a false light. Yet, as we have\r\nsaid, the work abounds in noble thoughts and true poetry. It may be read\r\nwith somewhat more than 'profit,' for it has within it a great and\r\nloving heart. True _humanity_ is impressed on every page, and where that\r\nexists greatness and beauty are never absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. By VICTOR HUGO.\r\n     New-York: Dick and Fitzgerald. 1862.\r\n\r\nMany years ago--say some thirty-odd--when French literature still walked\r\nin the old groves, and the classic form and style of the old revolution\r\nstill swayed all the minor minds, there sprung up a reäction in the\r\nso-called romantic school of which Victor Hugo became the leader. The\r\nmedieval renaissance, which fifty years before had penetrated Germany\r\nand England, and indeed all the North, was late in coming to France, but\r\nwhen it did come it stirred the Latin Quarter and Young France\r\nwonderfully. If its results were less remarkable in literature than in\r\nany other country, they were at least more admired in their day.\r\nPrincipal among these results was the novel now before us. And this book\r\nis really a tolerable imitation of Walter Scott. The feverish spirit of\r\nmodern France craved, indeed, stronger ingredients than the Wizard of\r\nthe North was wont to gather, and the _Hunchback_ is accordingly\r\n'sensational.' It has in fact been called extravagant--yes, forced and\r\nunnatural. Even ordinary readers were apt to say as much of it. We well\r\nremember meeting many years ago in a well-thumbed circulating-library\r\ncopy of the _Hunchback of Notre Dame_ the following doggerel on the last\r\npage:\r\n\r\n  'In Paris when to the Grève you go,\r\n  Pray do not grieve if VICTOR HUGO\r\n  Should there be hanging by a rope,\r\n  Without the blessing of the Pope,\r\n  Or that of any human creature\r\n  On him who libels human nature.'\r\n\r\nYet we counsel all who would be well-informed in literature--as well as\r\nthe far greater number of those who read only for entertainment, to get\r\nthis work. It is exciting--full of strange, quaint picturing of the\r\nMiddle Ages, has vivid characters, and is full of life. Among the series\r\nof books with fewer faults, but, alas! with far fewer excellencies,\r\nwhich are daily printed, there is, after all, seldom one so well worth\r\nreading as _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last we are wide awake. At last the nation has found out its\r\nstrength, and determined, despite doughface objections and impediments\r\nto every proposal of every kind, to push the war with energy, so that\r\nthe foe _shall_ be overwhelmed. Six hundred thousand men, as we write,\r\nwill soon swell the ranks of the Federal army, and if six hundred\r\nthousand more are needed they can be had. For the North is arming in\r\nreal earnest, thank God! and when it rises in _all_ its force, who shall\r\nwithstand it? It is a thing to remember with pride, that the\r\nproclamation calling for the second three hundred thousand by draft, was\r\nreceived with the same joy as though we had heard of a great victory.\r\n\r\nGovernment has not gone to work one day too soon. From a rebellion, the\r\npresent cause of strife has at length assumed the proportion of equal\r\nwar. The South has cast its _whole_ population, all its means, all its\r\nenergy, heart and soul, life and future, on one desperate game; while we\r\nwith every advantage have let out our strength little by little, so as\r\nto hurt the enemy as little as possible. Doughface democracy among us\r\nhas squalled as if receiving deadly wounds at every proposal to crush or\r\ninjure the foe. It opposed, heart and soul, the early On to Richmond\r\nmovement, when the Republicans clamored for an overwhelming army, a\r\ngrand rally, and a bold push. It rejoiced at heart over Bull Run--for\r\nthe South was saved for a time. It upheld the wounded snake, 'anaconda'\r\nsystem, it opposed the using of contrabands in any way, it urged, heart\r\nand soul, the protection of the property of rebels, it warred on\r\nconfiscation in any form, it was ready with a negative to every\r\nproposition to energetically push the war, and finally its press is now\r\nopposing the settling our soldiers on the cotton-lands of the South.\r\nThus far the slow course of this war of ten millions against twenty\r\nmillions is the history of the action of falsehood and treason benumbing\r\nthe majority. They have lied against us, and against millions, that the\r\nnegro was all we cared for, though it was the WHITE MAN, far, far above\r\nthe black for whom we spoke and cared, or how else could that _free_\r\nlabor in which the black is but a small unit have been our principal\r\nhope and thought?\r\n\r\nBut treason at home could not last forever, nor will lies always endure.\r\nThe people have found out that the foe _can not_ be gently whipped and\r\namiably reinstated in their old place of honor. Moreover we have no time\r\nto lose. Another year will find us financially bankrupt, and the enemy\r\nin all probability, in that case, free and fairly afloat by foreign aid.\r\n\r\nAnd if the South goes, _all_ may possibly go. In every city exist\r\ndesperate and unprincipled men--the FERNANDO WOODS of the\r\ndangerous classes--who to rule would do all in their power to break our\r\nremaining union into hundreds of small independencies. The South would\r\nflood us with smuggled European goods--for, be it remembered, this\r\niniquitous device to beat down our manufacture has always been prominent\r\non their programme--our industry would be paralyzed, exchanges ruined,\r\nand the Eastern and Middle States become paltry shadows of what they\r\nonce were.\r\n\r\nThe people have at last seen this terrible ghost stare them full in the\r\nface. They have found out that it is 'rule or ruin' in earnest. No time\r\nnow to have every decisive and expedient measure yelled down as\r\n'unconstitutional' or undemocratic or unprecedented. No days these to\r\nfight a maddened foe with conservative kid-gloves and frighten the fell\r\ntiger back with democratic rose-water. We must do all and every thing,\r\neven as the foe have done. We have been generous, we have been\r\nmerciful--we have protected property, we have returned slaves, we have\r\nlet our wounded lie in the open air and die rather than offend the\r\nfiendish-hearted women of Secessia--and what have we got by it? Lies and\r\nlies, again and yet again. For refusing to touch the black, Mr. Lincoln\r\nis termed by the Southern press 'a dirty negro-stealer,' and our troops,\r\nfor _not_ taking the slaves and thereby giving the South all its present\r\ncrop and for otherwise aiding them, are simply held up as hell-hounds\r\nand brigands. Much we have made by forbearance!\r\n\r\nThe miserable position held by Free State secessionists, Breckinridge\r\nDemocrats, rose-water conservatives, and other varieties of the great\r\nNorthern branch of Southern treason, is fully exemplified by the\r\nfollowing extract from Breckinridge's special organ, the Louisville\r\n_Courier_, printed while Nashville was still under rebel rule, an\r\narticle which has been of late more than once closely reëchoed and\r\nimitated by the Richmond _Whig_.\r\n\r\n     'This,' says the _Courier_, 'has been called a fratricidal war by\r\n     some, by others an irrepressible conflict between freedom and\r\n     slavery. We respectfully take issue with the authors of both these\r\n     ideas. We are not the brothers of the Yankees, and the slavery\r\n     question is merely the _pretext, not the cause of the war_. The\r\n     true irrepressible conflict lies fundamentally in the hereditary\r\n     hostility, the sacred animosity, the eternal antagonism, between\r\n     the two races engaged.\r\n\r\n     'The Norman cavalier can not brook the vulgar familiarity of the\r\n     Saxon Yankee, while the latter is continually devising some plan to\r\n     bring down his aristocratic neighbor to his own detested level.\r\n     Thus was the contest waged in the old United States. So long as\r\n     _Dickinson dough-faces were to be bought_, and _Cochrane cowards to\r\n     be frightened_, so long was the Union tolerable to Southern men;\r\n     but when, owing to divisions in our ranks, the Yankee hirelings\r\n     placed one of their own spawn over us, political connection became\r\n     unendurable, and separation necessary to preserve our\r\n     _self-respect_.\r\n\r\n     'As our Norman friends in England, always a minority, have ruled\r\n     their Saxon countrymen in political vassalage up to the present\r\n     day, so have we, the slave oligarchs, governed the Yankees till\r\n     within a twelve-month. We framed the Constitution, for seventy\r\n     years molded the policy of the Government, and placed our own men,\r\n     or '_Northern men with Southern principles_,' in power.'\r\n\r\nCool--and in part true. They _did_ rule us in political vassalage, they\r\n_did_ place their own men, or 'Northern men with Southern principles,'\r\nin power, and there are scores of such abandoned traitors even now\r\ncrying out 'pro-slavery' and abusing Emancipation among us, in the hope\r\nthat if some turn of Fortune's wheel should separate the South, they may\r\nagain rise to power as its agents and representatives! GOD help them! It\r\nis hard to conceive of men sunk so low! Nobody wants them now--but a\r\ntime _may_ come. They are in New-York--there is a peculiarly\r\ncontemptible clique of them in Boston, and the Philadelphia _Bulletin_\r\ninforms us that there is exactly such another precious party in the city\r\nof Brotherly Love, who are 'in a very awkward position just now,\r\ninasmuch as there is no market for them. They are in the position of\r\nJohnson and Don Juan in the slave-market at Constantinople, and ready to\r\nexclaim:\r\n\r\n  'I wish to G--d that some body would buy us!''\r\n\r\nThe first draft for the army was a death-blow to the slow-poison\r\ndemocracy, and it has been frightened accordingly. Like a slug on whom\r\nsalt has just begun to fall, the crawling mass is indeed manifesting\r\nsymptoms of frightened activity--but it is the activity of death. For\r\nthe North is awake in real earnest; it is out with banner and bayonet;\r\nthere is to be no more playing at war or wasting of lives--the foe is to\r\nbe rooted out--_delanda est Dixie_. And in the hour of triumph where\r\nwill the pro-slavery traitors be then? Where? Where they always strive\r\nto be--on the _winning_ side. They will 'back water' as they have done\r\non progressive measure which they once opposed, since the war begun;\r\nthey will eat their words and fawn and wheedle those in power until the\r\nopportunity again occurs for building up on some sham principle a party\r\nof rum and faro-banks, low demagogue-ism, ignorance, reaction, and\r\nvulgarity. Then from his present toad-like swelling and whispering, we\r\nshall hear the full-expanded fiend roar out into a real life. It is the\r\nold story of history--the corrupt and venal arraigning itself against\r\ntruth and terming the latter 'visionary' and 'fanatical.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who visit the sick soldiers and do good in the hospitals\r\noccasionally get a gleam of fun among all the sad scenes--for any wag\r\nwho has been to the wars seldom loses his humor, although he may have\r\nlost all else save that and honor. Witness a sketch from life:\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE HEAVY.\r\n\r\nC----, good soul, after taking all the little comforts he could afford\r\nto give to the wounded soldiers, went into the hospital for the fortieth\r\ntime the other day, with his mite, consisting of several papers of\r\nfine-cut chewing-tobacco, Solace for the wounded, as he called it. He\r\ncame to one bed, where a poor fellow lay cheerfully humming a tune, and\r\nstudying out faces on the papered wall.\r\n\r\n'Got a fever?' asked C----.\r\n\r\n'No,' answered the soldier.\r\n\r\n'Got a cold?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, cold--lead--like the d----l!'\r\n\r\n'Where?'\r\n\r\n'Well, to tell you the truth, it's pretty well scattered. First, there's\r\na bullet in my right arm, they han't dug that out yet. Then there's one\r\nnear my thigh--it's sticking in yet: one in my leg--hit the bone--_that_\r\nfellow _hurts_! one through my left hand--that fell out. And I tell you\r\nwhat, friend, with all this lead in me, I feel, ginrally speaking, _a\r\nlittle heavy all over_!'\r\n\r\nC---- lightened his woes with a double quantity of Solace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC---- was a good fellow, and the soldier deserved his 'Solace.' Many of\r\nthem among us are poor indeed. 'Boys!' exclaimed a wounded volunteer to\r\ntwo comrades, as they paused the other day before a tobacconist's and\r\nexamined with the eyes of connoisseurs the brier or bruyére-wood pipes\r\nin his window, 'Boys! I'd give fifty dollars, if I had it, for four\r\nshillins to buy one of them pipes with!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a late number of an English magazine, Harriet Martineau gives some\r\naccount of her conversations, when in America in 1835, with\r\nChief-Justice Marshall and Mr. Madison. These men then represented the\r\nold ideas of the Republic and of Virginia as it had been. The following\r\nextract fully declares their opinions:\r\n\r\n     'When I knew Chief-Justice Marshall he was eighty-three--as\r\n     bright-eyed and warm-hearted as ever, while as dignified a judge as\r\n     ever filled the highest seat in the highest court of any country.\r\n     He said he had seen Virginia the leading State for half his life;\r\n     he had seen her become the second, and sink to be (I think) the\r\n     fifth.\r\n\r\n     'Worse than this, there was no arresting her decline if her\r\n     citizens did not put an end to slavery; and he saw no signs of any\r\n     intention to do so, east of the mountains, at least. He had seen\r\n     whole groups of estates, populous in his time, lapse into waste. He\r\n     had seen agriculture exchanged for human stock-breeding; and he\r\n     keenly felt the degradation.\r\n\r\n     'The forest was returning over the fine old estates, and the wild\r\n     creatures which had not been seen for generations were reäppearing,\r\n     numbers and wealth were declining, and education and manners were\r\n     degenerating. It would not have surprised him to be told that on\r\n     that soil would the main battles be fought when the critical day\r\n     should come which he foresaw.\r\n\r\n     'To Mr. Madison despair was not easy. He had a cheerful and\r\n     sanguine temper, and if there was one thing rather than another\r\n     which he had learned to consider secure, it was the Constitution\r\n     which he had so large a share in making. Yet he told me that he was\r\n     nearly in despair, and that he had been quite so till the\r\n     Colonization Society arose.\r\n\r\n     'Rather than admit to himself that the South must be laid waste by\r\n     a servile war, or the whole country by a civil war, he strove to\r\n     believe that millions of negroes could be carried to Africa, and so\r\n     got rid of. I need not speak of the weakness of such a hope. What\r\n     concerns us now is that he saw and described to me, when I was his\r\n     guest, the dangers and horrors of the state of society in which he\r\n     was living.\r\n\r\n     'He talked more of slavery than of all other subjects together,\r\n     returning to it morning, noon, and night. He said that the clergy\r\n     perverted the Bible because it was altogether against slavery; that\r\n     the colored population was increasing faster than the white; and\r\n     that the state of morals was such as barely permitted society to\r\n     exist.\r\n\r\n     'Of the issue of the conflict, whenever it should occur, there\r\n     could, he said, be no doubt. A society burdened with a slave system\r\n     could make no permanent resistance to an unencumbered enemy; and he\r\n     was astonished at the fanaticism which blinded some Southern men to\r\n     so clear a certainty.\r\n\r\n     'Such was Mr. Madison's opinion in 1855.'\r\n\r\nBut the trial has come at last, and it is for the country to decide\r\nwhether the South is to be allowed to secede, or to remain strengthened\r\nby their slaves, planting and warring against us until our own resources\r\nbecoming exhausted, Europe can at an opportune moment intervene. But\r\nwill that be the end? Will not Russia revenge the Crimea by aiding\r\nus--will not Austria be dismembered, France on fire, Southern Europe in\r\narms, and one storm of anarchy sweep over the world? It is all possible,\r\nshould we persevere in fighting the enemy with one hand and feeding him\r\nwith the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is such a thing as silly theatrical sentiment, and much of it is\r\nshown in the vulgar, melodramatic acting out of popular songs, as shown\r\nby the subjoined brace of anecdotes:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: I have had, in my time, not a little experience\r\n     of jailer, warden, and, of late, camp life, and would like to say a\r\n     word about silly, misplaced sympathy, of which I have witnessed\r\n     enough in all conscience.\r\n\r\n     At one time, while officering it in a prison not one thousand\r\n     miles--as the penny papers say--from the State of New-York, we\r\n     received into our hands about as degraded a specimen of the _genus_\r\n     'murderer,' as it was ever my lot to see. He had killed a woman in\r\n     a most cowardly and cruel manner, and was, to my way of thinking,\r\n     (and I was used to such fellows,) about as brutal-looking a human\r\n     beast as one need look at. However, we had hardly got him into a\r\n     cell, before a carriage drove up to the door, and a\r\n     splendidly-dressed lady, with a basket of oranges and a five-dollar\r\n     camellia bouquet, asked to see the prisoner.\r\n\r\n     '_Do_ let me see him!' she cried, 'I read of him in the newspaper,\r\n     and, guilty as he is, I would fain contribute my mite to soothe\r\n     him.'\r\n\r\n     'He is a rough customer, marm,' said my assistant.\r\n\r\n     'Yes, but you know what the poet says:\r\n\r\n     \"Bring flowers to the captive's lonely cell.\"\r\n\r\n     So she went in. She took but small notice of the prisoner, however,\r\n     arranged her bouquet, left her oranges, and departed. It occurred\r\n     to me to promptly search the bouquet for a concealed note or file,\r\n     so I entered the cell as she went out. I found Shocky, as we called\r\n     him, sucking away at an orange, and staring at the flowers in great\r\n     amazement. Finally, he spoke.\r\n\r\n     'Wat in ----'s the use a sendin' them things to a feller fur,\r\n     unless they give him the rum with 'em?'\r\n\r\n     'What do you suppose they are meant for?' I replied.\r\n\r\n     'Why, to make bitters with, in course. An't them come-a-mile\r\n     flowers?'\r\n\r\n     The second is something of the same sort. Not long since, a lot of\r\n     us--I am an H. P., 'high private,' now--were quartered in several\r\n     wooden tenements, and in the inner room of one lay the _corpus_ of\r\n     a young Secesh officer, awaiting burial. The news soon spread to a\r\n     village not far off. Down came tearing a sentimental and not\r\n     bad-looking specimen of a Virginny dame.\r\n\r\n     'Let me kiss him for his mother!' she cried, as I interrupted her\r\n     progress. '_Do_ let me kiss him for his mother!'\r\n\r\n     'Kiss whom?'\r\n\r\n     'The dear little lieutenant, the one who lies dead within. P'int\r\n     him out to me, sir, if you please. I never saw him, but--oh!'\r\n\r\n     I led her through a room in which Lieutenant ----, of Philadelphia,\r\n     lay stretched out on an up-turned trough, fast asleep. Supposing\r\n     him to be the 'article' sought for, she rushed up, and exclaiming,\r\n     'Let me kiss him for his mother,' approached her lips to his\r\n     forehead. What was her amazement when the 'corpse,' ardently\r\n     clasping its arms around her, returned the salute vigorously, and\r\n     exclaimed:\r\n\r\n     'Never mind the old lady, Miss, go it on your own account. I\r\n     haven't the slightest objection!'\r\n\r\n     Sentiment is a fine thing, Mr. Editor, but it should be handled as\r\n     one handles the spiked guns which the rebels leave behind, loaded\r\n     with percussion-caps--very carefully.\r\n\r\n     Yours amazingly,\r\n\r\n     WARDEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReaders who are desirous of seeing Ravenshoe fully played out will\r\nplease glance at the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nRAVENSHOE--ITS SEQUEL.\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThere are those who assert that the doctrine of Compensation is utterly\r\nignored in Ravenshoe. They instance the rewarding Welter, a coarse,\r\nbrutal scoundrel and sensual beast, with wealth and title, and such\r\nhonor as the author can confer, as an insult to every rational reader;\r\nnor can they think Charles Ravenshoe, or Horton, who endeavored right\r\nmanfully to support himself, repaid for this exertion, and for bearing\r\nup stoutly against his troubles, by being compelled 'to pass a dull,\r\nsettled, dreaming, melancholy old age' as an invalid.\r\n\r\nIt may naturally be thought that a residence of years in Australia, the\r\nmother of Botany Bay, where not exactly the best of American society\r\ncould be found, has had its effect in embittering even an Englishman\r\nagainst Americans, and of embroiling him with his own countrymen;\r\ntherefore the reader must smile at this principle of rewarding vice and\r\npunishing virtue; it is what Ravenshoe pretends to be--something novel.\r\n\r\nThe extreme dissatisfaction of the public with this volume calls\r\nimperatively for a satisfactory conclusion to it, consequently a sequel\r\nis now presented in what the Australians call the most 'bloody dingo[6]\r\npoliteful' manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA small boy with a dirty face met another small boy similarly\r\ncaparisoned. Said the first: 'Eech! you don' know how much twicet two\r\nis?'\r\n\r\n'You are a ----' (we suppress the word he used; suffice it to say, it\r\nmay be defined, 'a kind of harp much used by the ancients!')--'twicet\r\ntwo is four. Hmm!' replied the second.\r\n\r\nThe reader may not see it, but the writer does, that this trivial\r\nconversation has important bearing on the fate of William Ravenshoe, the\r\nwrongful-rightful, rightful-wrongful, etcetera, heir. For further\r\nparticulars, see the Bohemian Girl, where a babe is changed by a nurse\r\nin order that the nurse may have change for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Horton Ravenshoe returned once more to his paternal acres,\r\nit will be remembered he settled two thousand pounds a year, rent-charge\r\non Ravenshoe, in favor of William Ravenshoe. Over and above this,\r\nCharles enjoyed from this estate and from what Lord Saltire (Satire?)\r\nwilled him, no less than fourteen thousand pounds; his settlement on\r\nWilliam was therefore by no means one half of the income, consequently\r\nunfair to the exiled Catholic half-brother.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Father Mackworth he was followed by a gentleman in\r\ncrow-colored raiment, named Father Macksham, who accompanied William,\r\nthe ex-heir, to a small cottage, where the plots inside were much larger\r\nthan the grass-plots outside, and where Father Macksham hatched the\r\nfollowing fruit, which only partially ripened. He determined to\r\noverthrow Welter by the means of Adelaide, then overthrow Adelaide by\r\nmeans of Charles Ravenshoe, then overthrow the latter by his\r\nillegitimate brother, and finally throw the last over in favor of the\r\nJesuits. He occupied all his spare moments preparing the fireworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that Adelaide, wife of Welter, or Lord Ascot,\r\nbroke her back while attempting to jump a fence, mounted on the back of\r\nthe Irish mare 'Molly Asthore,' but the reader does not know that Welter\r\nwas the cause of his wife's fall, and that he actually hired a groom to\r\nscare 'Molly Asthore' so that she would take the fence, and also his\r\nwife out of this vale of tears. (This sentence I know is not\r\ngrammatical; who cares?) Welter, when he saw that his wife was not\r\nkilled, was furious. His large red brutal face turned to purple; he\r\nsmote his prize-fighting chest with his huge fists, he lowered his\r\neyebrows until he resembled an infuriated hog, and then he retired to\r\nhis house and drank a small box of claret--pints--twenty-four to the\r\ndozen!\r\n\r\nAdelaide, too, was furious, but she sent privately to London for Surgeon\r\nForsups--he came; then in the night season, unbeknown to Welter, an\r\noperation was performed, and behold! in the morning light lay Adelaide,\r\ntall, straight, commanding, proud--well as ever! in fact, straight as a\r\nshingle. Do you think she wanted to choke Welter? I do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNature was in one of her gloomiest moods, the clouds were the color of\r\nburnt treacle, the sombre rain pelted the dismal streets; mud was\r\neverywhere, desolation, misery, wet boots, and ruined hats. In the midst\r\nof such a scene, Welter, Lord Ascot, died of apoplexy in the throat,\r\ncaused by a rope. Who did the deed? Owls on the battlements answer me.\r\nDid he do it himself or was it done for him? Shrieking elements respond.\r\nEcho answers: Justice!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRavenshoe bay again. Sunlight on the waters; clear blue sky; all nature\r\nsmiling serenely; Charles Ravenshoe--I adore the man when I think of\r\nhim--landing a forty-four-pound salmon; ruddy with health, joyous in\r\ncountenance; two curly-headed boys screaming for joy; his wife, 'she\r\nthat was' (Americanism picked up among Yorkshiremen in Australia) Mary\r\nCorby, laughing heartily at the _tout ensemble_. William Ravenshoe\r\naffectionately helping Charles with a landing-net to secure the salmon,\r\nthus speaks to him:\r\n\r\n'Charles, this idea of yours of dividing the 'state evenly between us is\r\nnoble, but I shall not accept it. I would like a small piece of the tail\r\nof this salmon for dinner, though, if it will not rob you.'\r\n\r\n'William, halves in every thing between us is my motto; so say no more\r\nabout it. The delightful news that Father Macksham has at last fallen a\r\nvictim to his love of gain, while trying to run a cargo of cannons,\r\npowder, and Enfield rifles to the confederate States, IN DIRECT\r\nOPPOSITION TO HER BLESSED MAJESTY'S COMMANDS, rejoices my heart to that\r\nextent that I exclaim, perish all Jesuits! Now that you have turned\r\nProtestant, and are thoroughly out of the woods of medieval romance, I\r\nmay say,\r\n\r\n  'The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold,'\r\n\r\nand quote Tennyson, like poor Cuthbert, all day long. Who is there to\r\nhinder?'\r\n\r\n'No one,' replied William, with all the warmth of heart of a man who was\r\nonce a groom and then a bridegroom. 'No one. I saw Adelaide this morning\r\na-carrying flannels and rum to the poor of the parish; how thoroughly\r\nshe has reformed, I'm sure.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader, let us pause here and dwell on the respective merits of the\r\nBohemian Girl, and Father Rodin in the _Mysteries of Paris_, compared\r\nwith the characters described in _Ravenshoe_. Let us ask if an English\r\nnovel can be written without allusion to the Derby or Life at Oxford,\r\nthe accumulation of pounds or the squandering of pounds, rightful heirs\r\nor wrongful heirs, false marriages, or the actions of spoiled children\r\ngenerally? An answer is looked for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'And further this deponent sayeth not.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Nashville _Union_--the new Union newspaper of that city--is\r\nemphatically 'an institution,' and a dashing one at that. Its every\r\ncolumn is like the charge of a column of infantry into the unhallowed\r\nRebel-ry of Disunion. 'Don't compromise your loyalty with rebels,' says\r\nthe _Union_, 'until you are ready to compromise your soul with the\r\ndevil.'\r\n\r\nSome of the humor of this brave pioneer sheet is decidedly piquant.\r\nAmong its quizzical literary efforts the review of Rev. Dr. McFerrin's\r\n_Confederate Primer_ is good enough to form the initial of a series. We\r\nmake the following extracts:\r\n\r\n     'Nothing is more worthy of being perpetuated than valuable\r\n     contributions to literature. The literature of a nation is its\r\n     crown of glory, whose reflected light shines far down the\r\n     swift-rolling waves of time and gladdens the eyes of remote\r\n     generations. This beautiful and--to our notion--finely-expressed\r\n     sentiment was suggested to our mind in turning over the pages of\r\n     Rev. Dr. McFerrin's _Confederate Primer_, which we briefly noticed\r\n     yesterday. We feel that we then passed too hastily over a work so\r\n     grand in its conception.... The _Primer_, after giving the alphabet\r\n     in due form, offers some little rhymes for youngsters, which are\r\n     perfect nosegays of sentiment, of which the following will serve\r\n     as samples:\r\n\r\n  N.\r\n\r\n  At Nashville's fall\r\n  We sinned all.\r\n\r\n  T.\r\n\r\n  At Number Ten\r\n  We sinned again.\r\n\r\n  F.\r\n\r\n  Thy purse to mend,\r\n  Old Floyd, attend.\r\n\r\n  L.\r\n\r\n  Abe Lincoln bold,\r\n  Our ports doth hold.\r\n\r\n  D.\r\n\r\n  Jeff Davis tells a lie,\r\n  And so must you and I.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  Isham doth mourn\r\n  His case forlorn.\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\n  Brave Pillow's flight\r\n  Is out of sight.\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  Buell doth play,\r\n  And after slay.\r\n\r\n  O.\r\n\r\n  Yon Oak will be the gallows-tree\r\n  Of Richmond's fallen majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Ishain Harris 'catches it' in the following extract from the\r\nEasy Reading Lessons for Children:\r\n\r\n\r\n'LESSON FIRST.\r\n\r\n'THE SMART DIX-IE BOY.\r\n\r\n     'Once there was a lit-tle boy, on-ly four years old. His name was\r\n     Dix-ie. His fa-ther's name was I-sham, and his moth-er's name was\r\n     All-sham. Dix-ie was ver-y smart, He could drink whis-ky, fight\r\n     chick-ens, play po-ker, and cuss his moth-er. When he was on-ly two\r\n     years old, he could steal su-gar, hook pre-serves, drown kit-tens,\r\n     and tell lies like a man. By and by Dix-ie died, and went to the\r\n     bad place. But the dev-il would not let Dix-ie stay there, for he\r\n     said: 'When you get big, Dix-ie, you would be head-devil yourself.'\r\n     All little Reb-els ought to be like Dix-ie, and so they will, if\r\n     they will stud-y the _Con-fed-e-rate Prim-er_.'\r\n\r\nVery good, too, is the powerful and thrilling sermon on the 'Curse of\r\nCowardice,' delivered by the Rev. Dr. Meroz Armageddon Baldwin, from\r\nwhich we take 'the annexed:'\r\n\r\n     'Then there is Gideon Pillow, who has undertaken a contract for\r\n     digging that 'last ditch,' of which you have heard so much. I am\r\n     afraid that the white 'feathers will fly' whenever _that_ Case is\r\n     opened, and that Pillow will give us the slip. 'The sword of the\r\n     Lord' isn't 'the sword of Gideon' Pillow--_that's_ certain--so I\r\n     shall bolster him up no longer. Gideon is 'a cuss,' and a 'cuss of\r\n     cowardice.''\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see that the good cause has so stalwart and keen a\r\ndefender in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have our opinion that the following anecdote is true. If not, it is\r\n'well found'--or founded.\r\n\r\nNot long since, an eminent 'Conserve' of Boston was arguing with a\r\ncertain eminent official in Washington, drilling away, of course, on the\r\nold pro-slavery, pro-Southern, pro-give-it-up platform.\r\n\r\n'But what _can_ you do with the Southerners?' he remarked, for 'the\r\nfrequenth' time. 'You can't conquer them--you can't reconcile them--you\r\ncan't bring them back--you can't do any thing with them.'\r\n\r\n'But we may _annihilate_ them,' was the crushing reply.\r\n\r\nAnd CONSERVE took his hat and departed.\r\n\r\nIt is, when we come to facts, really remarkable that it has not occurred\r\nto the world that there _can_ be but one solution to a dispute which has\r\ngone so far. _There is no stopping this war._ Secession is an\r\nimpossibility. If we _willed_ it, we could not prevent 'an institutional\r\nrace' from absorbing one which has no accretive principle of growth. It\r\nis thought, as we write, that during the week preceding July 4th,\r\n_seventy thousand_ of the Secession army perished! They are exhausting,\r\nannihilating themselves; and by whom will the vacancy be filled? Not by\r\nthe children of States which, under the old system, fell behindhand in\r\npopulation. By whom, then? By Northern men and European emigrants, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBut European intervention? If Louis Napoleon wants to keep his crown--if\r\nEngland wishes Europe to remain quiet--if they both dread our good\r\nfriend Russia, who in event of a war would 'annex,' for aught we can\r\nsee, all Austria and an illimitable share of the East--if they wish to\r\navoid such an upstirring, riot, and infernal carnival of revolution as\r\nthe world never saw--they will let us alone.\r\n\r\nThe London _Herald_ declares that 'America is a nuisance among nations!'\r\nWhen they undertake to meddle with us, they will find us one. We would\r\nnot leave them a ship on the sea or a seaboard town un-ruined. The whole\r\nworld would wail one wild ruin, and there should be the smoke as of\r\nnations, when despotism should dare to lay its hand on the sacred cause\r\nof freedom. For we of the North are living and dying in that cause which\r\nnever yet went backward, and we shall prevail, though the powers of all\r\nEurope and all the powers of darkness should ally against us. Let them\r\ncome. They do but bring grapes to the wine-press of the Lord; and it\r\nwill be a bloody vintage which will be pressed forth in that day, as the\r\ngreat cause goes marching on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet no one imagine that our military draft has been one whit too great.\r\nOur great folly hitherto has been to underrate the power of the enemy.\r\nIn the South every male who can bear arms is now either bearing them or\r\notherwise directly aiding the rebellion. When the sheriffs of every\r\ncounty in the seceding States made their returns to their Secretary of\r\nWar, they reported one million four hundred thousand men capable of\r\nbearing arms. And they have the arms and will use them. It is 'an united\r\nrising of the people,' such as the world has seldom seen.\r\n\r\nBut then it is _all_ they can do--it is the last card and the _last_\r\nman, and if we make one stupendous effort, we must inevitably crush it.\r\nThere is no other course--it is drag or be dragged, hammer or anvil now.\r\nIf we do not beat _them_ thoroughly and completely, they will make us\r\nrue the day that ever we were born.\r\n\r\nThe South is stronger than we thought, and its unity and ferocity add to\r\nits strength. It will never be conciliated--it must be crushed. When we\r\nhave gained the victory, we can be what our foes never were to\r\nus--generous and merciful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA GENTLEMAN of Massachusetts, who has held a position in McClellan's\r\narmy that gave him an opportunity to know whereof he speaks, states that\r\nfor weeks, while the army on the Peninsula were in a grain-growing\r\ncountry, surrounded by fields of wheat and oats belonging to well-known\r\nrebels, the Commissary Department was not allowed to turn its cattle\r\ninto a rich pasturage of young grain, from the fear of offending the\r\nabsent rebel owners, or of using in any way the property of Our Southern\r\nBrethren in arms against us. The result was, that the cattle kept with\r\nthe army for the use of our hard-worked soldiers, were penned up, and\r\nhalf-starved on the forage carried in the regular subsistence trains,\r\nand the men got mere skin and bones for beef.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo endeth the month. The rest with the next. But may we, in conclusion,\r\nbeg sundry kind correspondents to have patience? Time is scant with us,\r\nand labor fast and hard. Our editorial friends who have kindly cheered\r\nus by applauding 'the outspoken and straightforward young magazine,'\r\nwill accept our most grateful thanks. It has seldom happened to any\r\njournal to be so genially and _warmly_ commended as we have been since\r\nour entrance on the stormy field of political discussion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The _dingo_, or native dog of Australia, looks like a cross\r\nbetween the fox or wolf and the shepherd-dog; they generally hunt in\r\npacks, and destroy great numbers of sheep. I have never eaten one.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL MONTHLY\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY has passed its experimental ordeal, and\r\nstands firmly established in popular regard. It was started at a period\r\nwhen any new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the\r\npublisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.\r\nFearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,\r\nfor the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has\r\nfound favor in quarters where censure was expected, and patronage where\r\nopposition only was looked for. While holding firmly to its _own\r\nopinions_, it has opened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS _of\r\nwidely different views_, and has made a feature of employing the\r\nliterary labors of the _younger_ race of American writers. How much has\r\nbeen gained by thus giving, practically, the fullest freedom to the\r\nexpression of opinion, and by the infusion of fresh blood into\r\nliterature, has been felt from month to month in its constantly\r\nincreasing circulation.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE\r\nCONTINENTAL many of its political articles, and the result is, it\r\nhas not given labored essays fit only for a place in ponderous\r\nencyclopedias, but fresh, vigorous, and practical contributions on men\r\nand things as they exist.\r\n\r\nIt will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a\r\nguarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant\r\ntalent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able\r\npolitical articles which have given it so much reputation will be\r\ncontinued in each issue, together with the new Novel by Richard B.\r\nKimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents of Wall-Street,' 'St.\r\nLeger,' etc., entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\nAn account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading\r\nmen in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the\r\nChurch, recounting what he did, and how he made his money. This work\r\nexcels the previous brilliant productions of this author. In the present\r\nnumber is also commenced a new Serial by the author of 'Among the\r\nPines,' entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY,\r\n\r\nwhich will depict Southern _white_ society, and be a truthful history of\r\nsome eminent Northern merchants who are largely in 'the cotton trade and\r\nsugar line.'\r\n\r\nThe UNION--The Union of ALL THE STATES--that indicates\r\nour politics. To be content with no ground lower than the highest--that\r\nis the standard of our literary character.\r\n\r\nWe hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and\r\nall who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic\r\nliterature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is\r\nnot one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there\r\nis in every town in the loyal States some active person whose time might\r\nbe justifiably employed in procuring subscribers to our work.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 10                25 Cents.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nContinental\r\n\r\nMonthly\r\n\r\n\r\nDevoted To Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK AND BOSTON:\r\nJ.

Devoted to the NATIONAL CAUSE, it\r\nwill ardently and unconditionally support the UNION. Its scope\r\nwill be enlarged by articles relating to our public defenses, Army and\r\nNavy, gunboats, railroads, canals, finance, and currency. The cause of\r\ngradual emancipation and colonization will be cordially sustained. The\r\nliterary character of the Magazine will be improved, and nothing which\r\ntalent, money, and industry combined can achieve, will be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe political department will be controlled by Hon. ROBERT J.\r\nWALKER and Hon. FREDERIC P. STANTON, of Washington, D.C.\r\nMr. WALKER, after serving nine years as Senator, and four years\r\nas Secretary of the Treasury, was succeeded in the Senate by\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS. Mr. STANTON served ten years in\r\nCongress, acting as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and of Naval\r\nAffairs. Mr. WALKER was succeeded as Governor of Kansas by Mr.\r\nSTANTON, and both were displaced by Mr. BUCHANAN, for\r\nrefusing to force slavery upon that people by fraud and forgery. The\r\nliterary department of the Magazine will be under the control of\r\nCHARLES GODFREY LELAND of Boston, and EDMUND KIRKE of\r\nNew-York. Mr. LELAND is the present accomplished Editor of the\r\nMagazine. Mr. KIRKE is one of its constant contributors, but\r\nbetter known as the author of 'Among the Pines' the great picture true\r\nto life, of Slavery as it is.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL, while retaining all the old corps of writers,\r\nwho have given it so wide a circulation, will be reinforced by new\r\ncontributors, greatly distinguished as statesmen, scholars, and savans.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1862, by JAMES R.\r\nGILMORE, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New-York.",
