'Never, brother. When we are not engaged\r\nin our traffic we are engaged in our relaxations.'”--BORROW.\r\n\r\nOn the smooth beaches and in the silent bush, where time is not\r\nregulated by formalities or shackled by conventions, there delicious\r\nlapses--fag-ends of the day to be utilised in a dreamy mood which\r\nobserves and accepts the happenings of Nature without disturbing the\r\nshyest of her manifestations or permitting 'the-mind to dwell on any but\r\nthe vaguest speculations.\r\n\r\nSuch idle moments are mine. Let these pages tell of their occupation.\r\n\r\nAs the years pass it is proved that the administration of the affairs of\r\nan island, the settled population of which is limited to three, involves\r\npleasant though exacting duties. It is a gainful government--not\r\ngainful in the accepted sense, but in all that vitally matters--personal\r\nfreedom, absence of irksome regulations remindful of the street, liberty\r\nto enjoy the mood of the moment and to commune with Nature in her most\r\nfascinating aspects. Those who are out of touch with great and dusty\r\nevents may, by way of compensation, be the more sensitive to the\r\nprocesses of the universe, which, though incessantly repeated, are\r\nblessed with recurrent freshness.\r\n\r\nThe sun rises, travels across a cloudless sky, gleams on a sailless sea,\r\ndisappears behind purple mountains gilding their outline, and the day is\r\ndone. Not a single dust-speck has soiled sky or earth; not the faintest\r\necho of noisy labours disturbed the silences; not an alien sight has\r\nintruded. What can there be in such a scene to exhilarate? Must not\r\nthe inhabitants vegetate dully after the style of their own bananas?\r\nActually the day has been all too brief for the accomplishment of\r\ninevitable duties and to the complete enjoyment of all too alluring\r\nrelaxations.\r\n\r\nHere is opportunity to patronise the sun, to revel in the companionship\r\nof the sea, to confirm the usage of beaches, to admonish winds to\r\nseemliness and secrecy, to approve good-tempered trees, to exchange\r\nconfidences with flowering plants, to claim the perfumed air, to rejoice\r\nin the silence--\r\n\r\n    “Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,\r\n    Which pries not to th' interior.”\r\n\r\nHow oft is the confession that the fullest moments of life are achieved\r\nwhen I roam the beaches with little more in the way of raiment than\r\nsunburn and naught in hand save the leaves of some strange, sand-loving\r\nplant? Then is it that the individual is magnified. The sun salutes. The\r\nwind fans. The sea sighs a love melody. The caressing sand takes print\r\nof my foot alone. All the world might be mine, for none is present to\r\ndispute possession. The sailless sea smiles in ripples, and strews its\r\nverge with treasures for my acceptance. The sky's purity enriches my\r\nsoul. Shall I not joy therein?\r\n\r\nThough he may be unable to attain those moments of irresistible\r\nintuition which came to Amiel, when a man feels himself great like the\r\nuniverse and calm like a god, one may thrill with love and admiration\r\nfor Nature without resigning sense of superiority over all other of her\r\nworks or abating one jot of justifiable pride.\r\n\r\nEven in tropical Queensland there is a sense of revivification during\r\nthe last half of August and first of September, and the soul of man\r\nresponds thereto, as do plants and birds, in lawful manner. Perhaps it\r\nis that the alien dweller in lands of the sun, when he frisks mentally\r\nand physically at this sprightly season, is merely obeying an imperative\r\ncharacteristic bred into him during untold generations when the winter\r\nwas cruelly real and spring a joyful release from cold and distress. The\r\ncause may be slight, but there is none to doubt the actual awakening,\r\nfor it is persuasive and irresistible.\r\n\r\nThe lemon-trees are discarding the burden of superfluous fruit with\r\nalmost immoderate haste, for the gentle flowers must have their day.\r\nPomeloes have put forth new growth a yard long in less than a fortnight,\r\nand are preparing a bridal array of blooms such as will make birds\r\nand butterflies frantic with admiration and perfume the scene for the\r\ncompass of a mile. The buff-and-yellow sprays of the mango attract\r\nmillions of humming insects, great and small. Most of the orchids are\r\nin full flower, the coral-trees glow, the castanospermum is full of\r\nbud, loose bunches of white fruit decorate the creeping palms, and\r\nthe sunflower-tree is blotched with gold in masses. The birds make\r\ndeclaration of attachment for the season.\r\n\r\nGreat trees, amorous birds, frail insects, perceive the subtle influence\r\nof the season, and shall not coarse-fibred man rejoice, though there\r\nbe little or nothing to which he may point as special evidence of\r\ninspiration? He may feel the indefinable without comprehending any\r\nmaterial reason why. He may confess, although there is but a trifle more\r\nsunshine than a month ago--and what influence a trifle where there is\r\nso much--and scarcely any difference of temperature, that Nature is\r\ninsisting on obedience to one of her mighty laws--the law of heredity.\r\nWhy, therefore, refrain from justifying the allusion? Why persist in\r\ndeclining the invitations of the hour? Far be it from me to do so. Is\r\nsufferance the cognizance of this Free Isle?\r\n\r\nAll my days are Days of the Sun. All my days are holy. Duty may suggest\r\nthe propriety of contentment within four walls. Inclination and the\r\nthrill of the season lure me to gloat over the more manifest of its\r\nmagic. Be sure that, unabashed and impenitent, shall I riot over\r\nsordid industry during the most gracious time of year to hearken to the\r\neloquence and accept the teachings of unpeopled spaces.\r\n\r\nSuch is the silence of the bush that the silken rustle of the\r\nbutterflies becomes audible and the distinctive flight of birds is\r\nrecognised--not alone such exaggerated differences as the whirr of\r\nquail, the bustle of scrub fowl, and the whistle and clacking of nutmeg\r\npigeons, but the delicate and tender characteristics of the wing\r\nnotes of the meeker kinds of doves and the honey-eaters, and also the\r\ncalculated flutterings of the fly-catchers. In the whistling swoop of\r\nthe grey goshawk there is a note of ominous blood-thirstiness, silent\r\nthough the destroyer has sat awaiting the moment for swift and decisive\r\naction.\r\n\r\nSeldom, even on the stillest evening, may the presence of the night-jar\r\nbe detected, except by its coarse call, while the sprightly little\r\nsun-bird flits hither and thither, prodigal of its vivid colours\r\nand joying with machine-like whirring. The sun-bird exemplifies the\r\nbrightness of the day. All its activities are bold and conspicuous.\r\nAptly named, it has nothing to hide, no deeds which will not withstand\r\nthe scrutiny of the vividest rays.\r\n\r\nTo work out its destiny the night-jar depends on secret doings and on\r\nflight soft as a falling leaf. It is a bird of the twilight and night.\r\nStartled from brooding over its eggs or yet dependent chicks, it is\r\nghost-like in its flittings and disappearances. In broad daylight it\r\nmoves from its resting-place as a leaf blown by an erratic and sudden\r\npuff, and vanishes as it touches the sheltering bosom of Mother Earth.\r\nMark the spot of its vanishment and approach never so cautiously, and\r\nyou see naught. Peer about and from your very feet that which had been\r\ndeemed to be a shred of bark rises and is wafted away again by a phantom\r\nzephyr.\r\n\r\nThe chick which the parent bird has hidden remains a puzzle. It moves\r\nnot, it may not blink. Its crafty parent has so nibbled and frayed the\r\nedges of the decaying brown leaves among which it nestles that it has\r\nbecome absorbed in the scene. There is nothing to distinguish between\r\nthe leaf-like feathers and the feather-like leaves. The instinct of\r\nthe bird has blotted itself out. It is there, but invisible, and to\r\nbe discovered only by the critical inspection of every inch of its\r\nenvironment. You have found it; but not for minutes after its instinct\r\nhas warned it to possess its soul calmly and not to be afraid. So firm\r\nis its purpose that if inadvertently you put your foot on its tender\r\nbody it would not move or utter cry. All its faculties are concentrated\r\non impassiveness, and thus does Nature guard its weakest and most\r\nhelpless offspring.\r\n\r\nWhile you ponder on the wonderful faith of the tiny creature which\r\nsuffers handling without resistance, the shred of bark, driven by the\r\nimperceptible zephyr, falls a few yards away, and in an agony of anxiety\r\nutters an imploring purr, or was it an imprecation? That half purr, half\r\nhiss has been the only sound of the episode. It is a warning to be gone\r\nand leave Nature to her secrets and silences.\r\n\r\nA month's abstinence may not be a very severe penance for an island on\r\nwhich the rainfall averages 124 inches per year; but when vegetation\r\nsuffers from the cruelty of four almost rainless months, promises and\r\nslights amount to something more than mere discourtesy. How genuine\r\nthe thanksgiving to the soft skies after an incense-stimulating shower.\r\nInsects whirl in the sunshine. Among the pomelo-trees is a cyclone of\r\nscarcely visible things. Motes and specks of light dance in disorderly\r\nfigures, to be detected as animated objects only by gauzy wings catching\r\nthe light and reflecting it. Each insect, wakened but an hour ago by\r\nthe warmth of the moist soil, in an abandonment of the moment, is a\r\nhelioscope transmitting signals of pure pleasure. Drops still linger\r\non myriads of leaves, and glitter on the glorious gold of the Chinese\r\nlaburnum; the air is saturated with rich scents, and the frolicking\r\ncrowd, invisible but for the oblique light, does not dream of disaster.\r\nTheir crowded hour has attracted other eyes, appreciative in another\r\nsense. Masked wood-swallows, swiftlets, spangled drongos, leaden\r\nfly-eaters, barred-shouldered fly-eaters, hurry to the circus to\r\ndesolate it with hungry swoops. The assemblage is noisy, for two or\r\nthree drongos cannot meet without making a clatter on the subject of the\r\nmoment. They cannot sing, but clink and jangle with as much intensity\r\nand individual satisfaction as if gifted with peerless note. It is the\r\nheight of the season, and a newly matched pair, satisfied with an\r\nample meal, sit side by side on a branch to tell of their love, and\r\nin language which, though it may lack tunefulness, has the outstanding\r\nquality of enthusiasm. But why waste clamorous love-notes on a world\r\nbusy with breakfast? The sportful, tail-flicking dandy flits and alights\r\nso that he may address himself solely to his delighted and accepting\r\nspouse, peering into her reddish eyes the while, and in ecstasy\r\nproclaiming, in tones as loud and unmusical as her own, that life\r\noverflows with joy when mutual admiration surcharges the breast.\r\n\r\nThe noise stays a company of metallic starlings in headlong flight from\r\nthe nest-laden tree in the forest to the many-fruited jungle. Though\r\nthey most conscientiously search the fronds of coco-nut palms for\r\ninsignificant grubs and caterpillars, starlings do not hawk for insects.\r\nHeld up by the excitement--for by this time other birds have darted\r\nto the feast--the starlings alight among the plumes of the laburnum,\r\ninterrogating in acidulous tones, their black, burnished, iridescent\r\nfeathers and flame-hued eyes making a picture of rare vividness and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nHow thin becomes the throng! Last night's shower, the morning warmth of\r\nthe soil, have brought forth a gush of life that wheels and sparkles in\r\nthe sun and becomes bait for birds. Are droughts designed by Nature to\r\ntest endurance on the part of animal and vegetable life? Leaves fall\r\nfrom evergreen trees almost as completely as from the deciduous, and\r\neven the jungle is thickly strewn, while every slight hollow is filled\r\nwith brittle debris where usually leaves are limp with dampness and\r\nmould. The jungle has lost, too, its rich, moist odours. Whiffs of the\r\npleasant earthy smell, telling of the decay of clean vegetable refuse,\r\ndo issue in the early morning and after sundown; but while the sun is\r\nsearching out all the privacies of the once dim area, the wholesome\r\nfragrance does not exist.\r\n\r\nDrought proves that certain species of exotic plants are hardier than\r\nnatives. Wattles suffer more than mangoes, and citrus fruits have powers\r\nof endurance equal to eucalyptus. Whence does the banana obtain the\r\nliquid which flows from severed stem and drips from the cut bunch? Dig\r\ninto the soil and no trace of even dampness is there; but rather parched\r\nsoil and unnatural warmth, almost heat. Heat and moisture are the\r\nelements which enable one of the most succulent of plants to bear a\r\nbunch of fruit luscious and refreshing, and when heat alone prevails,\r\nthe wonder is that the whole patch of luxuriant greenness does not\r\ncollapse and wither. But the broad leaves woo the cool night airs, and\r\nwhile the thin, harsh, tough foliage of the wattles becomes languid and\r\ndroops and falls, the banana grove retains its verdancy, each plant a\r\nreservoir of sap.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy feature of the botany of the coast of tropical Queensland\r\nis its alliance with the Malayan Archipelago and India. Most of the\r\nrelated plants do not occur in those parts closest to other equatorial\r\nregions in the geographical sense, but in localities in which climate\r\nand physical conditions are similar. Probably there are more affinities\r\nin the coastal strip of which this isle is typical than in all the\r\nrest of the continent of Australia. One prominent example may be\r\nmentioned-viz., “the marking-nut tree.” When the distinctiveness of\r\nthe botany of the southern portions of Australia from that of the old\r\ncountry began to impress itself on the earliest settlers, the miscalled\r\nnative cherry was the very first on the list of reversals. The good\r\nfolks at home were told that the seeds of the Australian cherry “grow\r\non the outside.” The fruit of the cashew or marking-nut tree betrays\r\na similar feature in more pronounced fashion. The fruit is really the\r\nthickened, succulent stalk of the kidney-shaped nut. The tint of the\r\nfruit being attractive, unsophisticated children eat of it and earn\r\nscalded lips and swollen tongues, while their clothing is stained\r\nindelibly by the juice. Botanists know the handsome tree as SEMECARPUS\r\nAUSTRALIENSIS, but by the indignant parent of the child with tearful\r\nand distorted features and ruined raiment it is offensively called the\r\n“tar-tree,” and is subject to shrill denunciations. The fleshy stalk\r\nbeneath the fruit is, however, quite wholesome either raw or cooked, but\r\nthe oily pericarp contains a caustic principle actually poisonous, so\r\nthat unwary children would of a certainty eat the worst part. The tree,\r\nwhich belongs to the same order as the mango, has a limited range, and\r\nthere are those who would like to see it exterminated, forgetful that in\r\nother parts of the world the edible parts are enjoyed, and also that a\r\nvaluable means to the identification of linen is manufactured from it.\r\nA tree that is ornamental, that provides dense shade, that bears pretty\r\nand strange fruit, an edible part, and provides an economic principle,\r\nis not to be condemned off-hand because of one blot on its character.\r\n\r\nAn Indian representative of the genera produces a nut which when\r\nroasted is highly relished, though dubiously known as the coffin-nail\r\nor promotion nut, but there is no reason to believe that it is specially\r\nindigestible unless eaten in immoderate quantity.\r\n\r\nOne of the many bewilderments of botany is that plants of one family\r\nexhibit characteristics and habits so divergent that the casual observer\r\nfails to recognise the least signs of relationship. Similar confusion\r\narises in the case of plants of the same species producing foliage of\r\nvaried form. One of the figs (FICUS OPPOSITA) displays such remarkable\r\ninconsistency that until reassured by many examples it is difficult to\r\ncredit an undoubted fact. The typical leaf is oblong elliptical, while\r\nindividual plants produce lanceolate leaves with two short lateral\r\nlobes, with many intermediate forms. As the plant develops, the abnormal\r\nforms tend to disappear, though mature plants occasionally retain them.\r\nThere seems to exist correlation between foliage and fruit, for branches\r\nexhibiting leaves with never so slight a variation from the type are,\r\naccording to local observation, invariably barren. The leaves, which,\r\nwhen young, are densely hairy on the underside, on maturity become so\r\nrough and coarse that they are used by the blacks as a substitute for\r\nsandpaper in the smoothing of weapons. The fruit is small, dark purple\r\nwhen ripe, sweet, but rough to the palate.\r\n\r\nDuring the fulness of the wet season, a diminutive orchid, the roots,\r\ntuber, leaf, and flower of which may be easily covered by the glass of a\r\nlady's watch, springs upon exposed shoulders of the hills. So far it\r\nhas not been recorded for any other part of Australia, or, indeed, the\r\nworld. Science has bestowed upon it the title of CORYSANTHES FIMBRIATA,\r\nfor it is all too retiring of disposition to demand of man a familiar\r\nname. Probably it may be quite common in similar localities, but its\r\nsize, its brief periodicity, and inconspicuousness, contribute to make\r\nit, at present, one of the rarities of botany. Beneath a kidney-shaped\r\nleaf a tiny, solitary, hooded, purple flower shelters with becoming\r\nmodesty, the art of concealment being so delicately employed that it\r\nseems to preserve its virginal purity. There is proof, however, that the\r\nflower does possess some “secret virtue,” for if the plant be immersed\r\nin glycerine the preservative takes the hue of the flower. Nature having\r\nordained that the plants should be elusive, they appear in remote spots\r\nand unlikely situations with foothold among loose and gritty fragments\r\nof rock, and with cessation of the sustaining rains disappear, each\r\nhaving borne but a single leaf and produced but a solitary flower.\r\nThe leaf does not seem to be attractive to insects, nor is the flower\r\ndespoiled or the tuber interfered with. The first dry day sears the\r\nplants, and succeeding days shrivel them to dust and they vanish. What\r\npart in the great scheme of Nature does the humble flower fulfil? Or is\r\nit merely a lowly decoration, not designed to court the ardent gaze of\r\nthe sun, but to brighten an otherwise bare space of Mother Earth with a\r\nspot of fugitive purple?\r\n\r\nWidely different are the ant-house plants, of which North Queensland has\r\ntwo genera. One is purely an epiphyte, growing attached to a tree\r\nlike many of the orchids. In both genera the gouty stems are hollow, a\r\nfeature of which ants take advantage; they are merely occupiers, not the\r\nmakers of their homes. Few, if any, of the plants are uninhabited by\r\na resentful swarm, ready to attack whomsoever may presume to interfere\r\nwith it. It is discomposing to the uninitiated to find the curious\r\n“orchid,” laboriously wrenched from a tree, overflowing with stinging\r\nand pungent ants, nor is he likely to reflect that the association\r\nbetween the plant and the insect may be more than accidental.\r\n\r\nSome of the commonest wattles exhibit singularity of foliage well\r\nworth notice. Upon the germination of the seeds the primary leaves are\r\npinnate. After a brief period this pretty foliage is succeeded by a\r\nboomerang-shaped growth, which prevails during life. Botanists do not\r\nspeak of such trees as possessing leaves, but “leaf-stalks dilated into\r\nthe form of a blade and usually with vertical edges, as in Australian\r\nacacias.” If one of these wattles is burnt to the ground, but yet\r\nretains sufficient life to enable it to shoot from the charred stem, the\r\nnew growth will be of pinnate leaves, shortly to be abandoned for the\r\nsubstitutes, which are of a form which checks transpiration and fits\r\nthe plant to survive in specially dry localities. Several of the species\r\nthus equipped to withstand drought are extremely robust in districts\r\nwhere the rainfall is prolific. There are no data available to support\r\nthe theory that such species in a wet district are more vigorous and\r\nattain larger dimensions than representatives in drier and hotter\r\nlocalities. In her distribution of the Australian national flower,\r\nNature seems to be “careless of the type,” or rather regardless in\r\nrespect of conditions of climate.\r\n\r\nHuman beings, and occasionally animals lower in the scale, deviate\r\ndistressingly in their conduct from the general. Plants, too, though\r\nlacking the organ of brain, are subject to aberrations of foliage almost\r\nas fantastical as the mental bent which in man is displayed by the\r\nsticking of straws in the hair. “Phyllomania” is the recognised term for\r\nthis waywardness. One of the trees of this locality, the raroo (CAREYA\r\nAUSTRALIS), seems singularly prone to the infirmity, for without\r\napparent cause it abandons habitual ways and clothes its trunk and\r\nbranches with huge rosettes of small, slight, and ineffective leaves,\r\nevidence, probably, of vital degeneration.\r\n\r\nAmong the beautiful trees of this Island there is one, PITHECOLOBIUM\r\nPRUINOSUM, possessing features of attraction during successive phases of\r\ngrowth. The young branches, foliage, and inflorescence, are coated with\r\nminute silky hair, as if dusted with bronze of golden tint. The dense,\r\nlight, semi-drooping foliage produces a cloud-like effect, to which the\r\ngreat masses of buff flowers add a delightful fleeciness, while the ripe\r\npods, much twisted and involved (to carry similitude as far as it\r\nmay), might be likened to dull lightning in thunderous vapour. The tree\r\nflourishes in almost pure sand within a few yards of salt water, and,\r\nbeing hardy and of clean habit, might well be used decoratively.\r\n\r\nStanding with its feet awash at high tide, the huge fig-tree began life\r\nas a parasite, the seed planted by a beak-cleaning bird in a crevice of\r\nthe bark of its forerunner. In time the host disappeared, embraced and\r\nabsorbed. Now the tree is a sturdy host. Another fig envelops some\r\nof its branches, two umbrella-trees cling stubbornly to its sides, a\r\npandanus palm grows comfortably at the base of a limb, tons of staghorn,\r\nbird's-nest, polypodium, and other epiphytal ferns, have licence\r\nto flourish, orchids hang decoratively, and several shrubs spring\r\naspiringly among its roots. But the big tree still asserts its\r\nindividuality. It is the host, the others merely dependents or tenants.\r\nMost of the functions of the tree are associated with the sea. Twice a\r\nyear it studs its branches with pink fruit, food for many weeks for a\r\ncarnival of birds, the relics of the feast dully carpeting the sand.\r\nBefore the first fruiting the old leaves fall, and for a brief interval\r\nthe shadows of branches and twigs, intricate, involved, erratic, might\r\nbe likened to unschooled scribblings, with here a flourish and there\r\na blot and many a boisterous smudge. Soon--it is merely a question of\r\ndays--the swelling buds displace millions of leaf-sheaves, pale green\r\nand fragile, which fall and, curling in on themselves, redden, and again\r\nthe yellow sand is littered, while overhead fresh foliage, changing\r\nrapidly from golden, glistening brown to rich dark green, makes one\r\ncompact blotch. And when the wind torments sea and forest, and branches\r\nbend and sway, and creepers drift before it, the white blooms of the\r\norchids, so light and delicate that a sigh agitates them, might be “foam\r\nflakes torn from the fringe of spray” and tossed aloft.\r\n\r\nThe technical description of a fairly common tree--IXORA TIMORENSIS--is\r\nsilent on a quality that appeals to the unversed admirer almost as\r\nstrongly as the handsome flowers, which occur in large, loose panicles\r\nat the terminals of the branches. Boldly exposed, the white flowers as\r\nthey lose primal freshness change to cream, but last for several weeks.\r\nThe omitted compliment from formal records is the singular fragrance\r\nof the flowers--strong, sweet, and enticing, though with a drug-like\r\nsavour, as if rather an artificial addition than a provision of Nature.\r\nDuring December the perfume hangs heavily about the trees, being\r\nspecially virile in the cool of evening and morning. Being confined to\r\nthe tropical coast, away from the centres of population, and flowering\r\nat a season when visitors avoid the north, the scented Ixora has so far\r\nremained uncommended. Those who are familiar with it in its native scene\r\ndwell on its unique excellence, and are proud to reflect that when\r\na comprehensive catalogue of the flowering and perfumed plants of\r\nAustralia comes to be compiled it will stand high in order of merit,\r\nbeing unique and characteristic of the richness of that part of the\r\ncontinent in which it exists naturally.\r\n\r\nTwice during lengthy intervals have I been perturbed by the conduct of\r\nthe sea-swallows (terns) which breed in this neighbourhood. They select\r\nfor their nurseries coral banks, depositing large numbers of eggs beyond\r\nthe limit of high tides. In obedience to some law, the joyful white\r\nbirds began to lay in September, five or six weeks earlier than usual.\r\nIt seemed to be a half-hearted effort to maintain the strength of the\r\ncolony, the unanimous and general purpose being postponed for three\r\nmonths, when numerous clutches and marvellously variegated eggs\r\nembellished the coral. But that which was a perfectly safe and wise\r\nundertaking in September was a foolish and dangerous experiment in\r\nDecember. The tides then approach their maximum, flooding areas denied\r\nthree months previously. Wholesale tragedy was inevitable. The full\r\nmoon brought bereavement to many parents, for the sea overwhelmed the\r\nnurseries, or the best part of them. Many wise birds had laid their eggs\r\nabove the limit of the highest tide. Others screamed in protest against\r\nthe cruelty of the sea, for eggs and fluffy chicks do not surely\r\nrepresent legitimate tribute to Neptune. Several fledglings were found\r\nhalf buried in sand and coral chips, some with merely the head with\r\nbright and apprehensive eyes obtruding. Why were not the whole of\r\nthe parents of the colony prudent when in default the penalty was\r\ninevitable? Five score were wise, five hundred were foolish, and\r\nthe natural increase from the second brood must have been seriously\r\ndiminished. Several of the parent birds had brooded over their eggs\r\nuntil overwhelmed by the surges and drowned. Some on the tide limit\r\nsquatted buried to the eyes in sand and seaweed. Of one the tip of a\r\nwing only protruded. It was alive, fostering unbroken eggs.\r\n\r\nThe metallic starlings have again built on a favourite tree--not massive\r\nand tough, but a slim though tall Moreton Bay ash, the branchlets of\r\nwhich are not notoriously brittle. They withstand a certain weight,\r\nbeyond which they snap. Why do these otherwise highly intelligent birds\r\nso overstrain branches with groups of nests that “regrettable incidents”\r\n cannot be averted? First there came to the ground a group of four, and\r\nthen twenty nests, all containing eggs or helpless young. By these and\r\nsimilar mishaps during the season the colony suffered loss to the extent\r\nof at least a hundred.\r\n\r\n        “But, like the martlet,\r\n    Builds in the weather on the outward wall\r\n    Even in the force and road of casualty.”\r\n\r\nHow often, too, do we find nests in places absurdly wrong? Wonderfully\r\nand skilfully constructed nests are attached to supports obviously\r\nweak, and eggs are laid on the ground right in the track of man and less\r\nconsiderate animals. Some birds seem to lay eggs and rear young solely\r\nthat snakes may not lack and suffer hunger, while how large a proportion\r\nof beautiful and innocent creatures are destined to become prey to\r\nhawks?\r\n\r\nYears ago scientific visitors to a coral islet found almost innumerable\r\nsea birds and eggs. The multitude of birds and their prodigious\r\nfecundity inspired the thought that the “rookery” for the whole breadth\r\nof the Indian Ocean had been discovered. Investigations showed that the\r\nislet was also the abiding-place of a certain species of lizard which\r\nsubsisted entirely on eggs. It was calculated that not one egg in\r\nseveral hundred was hatched out; yet in spite of such an extraordinary\r\nnatural check the islet was enormously overpopulated. Thousands of birds\r\nevery year laid eggs for the maintenance of fat and pompous reptiles,\r\nwithout reflecting that there were other and lizardless isles on which\r\nthe vital function of incubation might be performed without loss.\r\nYears after other men of science sought the isle. Birds seemed to be as\r\nnumerous as ever, but the lizards had disappeared. Had the birds been\r\nwise enough to perceive that the plague of lizards had been sent as\r\nreproof for overcrowding, or did the lizards become victims to physical\r\ndeterioration incident upon gluttony and sloth?\r\n\r\n“Into every instinctive act there is an intrusion of reasoned act.”\r\n No doubt; but in the case of the terns--sea-frequenting and\r\nsea-loving--which had not the wit to lay their eggs beyond the reach of\r\nspring tides, the reasoning is the merest intrusion. Yet an instance of\r\nwhat seems to be the reasoned act of a wasp may be cited. The insect had\r\nselected a dead log of soft wood as a site for its egg-shaft. It was at\r\na spot to which the occupations of the season took me daily, so that the\r\nboring operations were watched from beginning to end. The work was done\r\nrapidly and neatly, and when all was ready for the deposit of the eggs\r\nthe insect constructed from papier-mache-like material a disc-shaped lid\r\nexactly fitting the mouth of the excavation, to which it was attached on\r\nits upper edge by a hinge. Then round and about the disc similar stuff\r\nwas plastered, so as to form an irregular splash, imitative of a bird's\r\ndroppings to the-degree of perfect deception. In the centre was the lid\r\nwith the hinge, and whensoever the insect visited its nursery the lid\r\nswung up, closing behind it. On departure it fell into position. Unless\r\nthe insect by its presence betrayed its secret, the shrewdest observer\r\nat close quarters would have been misled.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons for the belief that green tree-ants understand and\r\nrespect the laws of neutrality. There are several communities in the\r\nmango-trees, and since some of the trees overhang the fence, the top\r\nwire is used as a highway. When a gate is opened traffic is suspended.\r\nIn a minute or two of a busy day there will be considerable gatherings\r\non the latch-style, and if the intervening space is narrowed by the\r\nswing of the gate the impatient insects begin to make a living bridge\r\nacross the perilous gap. At one particular gate, which is opened and\r\nshut many times a day, it has been noticed that the ants never seem to\r\nresent interruptions or to be vexed by them. If they happen to get on\r\nthe hands or fingers, they submit to be restored to the gate; but go\r\nto the formicary on the mango-tree half a dozen yards away and offer\r\na friendly finger, and you will find dozens of pugnacious individuals\r\nready to defend their home. Do they recognise that they are but pilgrims\r\nof the fence, enjoying certain rights on sufferance, that it is a path\r\nof peace on which belligerents must not intrude, a neutral tract under\r\nthe custody of the law of nations, which ants, as well as men, must\r\nrespect? Whatsoever the reason, the deportment of the truculent ant on\r\nthe highway is that of an upholder of peace at any price. It is to be\r\ndoubted if the animal world holds more illustrious examples of heroism\r\nthan a green tree-ants' nest. Two or three individuals may be despised\r\nas long as their assaults are confined to the less sensitive parts of\r\nthe body; but let a huge colony up among the branches of an orange-tree\r\nbe disturbed, and the first army corps instantly mobilised, and it\r\nwill not be cowardly hastily to retreat. So eager for the fray are\r\nthe warriors, so well organised, so completely devoted to the\r\nself-sacrificing duty of protecting the community, that two distinct\r\nmethods of advance and attack are exercised forthwith in the midst of\r\nwhat appears to be calamitous confusion. Swarming on the extremity of\r\nthe branches among which the formicary is constructed, the defenders,\r\nprojecting their terminal segments as far into space as possible, eject\r\nformic acid in the direction of the enemy. Like shrapnel from machine\r\nguns, the liquid missile sweeps a considerable area. Against the\r\nsunlight it appears as a continuous spray, and should one infinitesimal\r\ndrop descend into the eye the stoutest mortal will blink. Attacks are\r\nmade singly and in detachments. Heroes actually hurl themselves from\r\nthe branches, and, failing to reach the enemy, run along the ground and,\r\nscaling his legs, inflict punishment on the first convenient patch of\r\nunprotected skin. Detachments muster in blobs, fall in a mass to\r\nthe ground, and charge. If one of these forlorn hopes happens to be\r\nsuccessful, the observant man will retire with little of his dignity\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how readily birds acquire tastes for the sweet\r\nfruits which man cultivates. One of the honey-eaters, the diet of which\r\nranges from nectar to the juice of one of the native cucumbers, as\r\nbitter as colocynth, has become an ardent advocate for the thorough\r\nripening of bananas. While on the plant the fruit is not appreciated,\r\nbut after the bunch has been hung for a week or so and the first fruits\r\nare changing colour the bird is enthusiastic. Formerly bunches were\r\nripened in a thatched building for the the most part open, and the bird\r\ngot the very best of the bunch. Now the process takes place where the\r\nbird has to venture through wire-netting. It has no fear, entering\r\nwithout ceremony, loudly complaining when inadvertently disturbed, and\r\nflying to other parts of the house to express remonstrance when the\r\nsupply is exhausted.\r\n\r\nScarcity of surface-water sharpens the powers of observation of some\r\nbirds and increases the trustfulness of certain species towards human\r\nbeings in a region wherein they are held to have rights on equality with\r\nthose of their superiors in the animal world. For years, during the few\r\nweeks which generally intervene between the disappearance of\r\naccustomed water reserves and the beginning of the wet season, with\r\nits super-abundance, the metallic starlings have been wont to obtain\r\nrefreshment from a hollow far up a huge tea-tree, the supply in which\r\nseemed to be inexhaustible. The tyrant's plea, necessity, ordained the\r\ndestruction of the never-failing tree, and now the starlings descend by\r\nthe hundred into the deep and shady ravine whence water is pumped,\r\nand drink also from the cattle-trough and bathe therein with noise and\r\nexcitement of happy children on the beach. It is quite within the mark\r\nto compute the starlings by the hundred. The trough is edged nearly all\r\nday long by thirsty or dirty birds, while scores sit round among the\r\nshrubs waiting turn and commenting on the frolics and splashings of\r\nothers in excitable tones. When, perhaps, there are but a poor dozen or\r\nso round the trough, you may chance to see the birds in attitudes more\r\nvaried than those of Pliny's doves, and catch the shadows of burnished\r\nnecks darkening the water, as in that famous mosaic, and even the\r\nglistening reflection of the red, jewel-like eyes. Other birds, with far\r\nless assurance and shrill clamour than the lovely starlings, visit\r\nthe trough regularly and by the score. Two species of honey-eaters are\r\nseldom unrepresented. The barred-shouldered dove, the spangled drongo,\r\nthe noisy pitta, the red-crowned fruit pigeon, the pheasant-tailed\r\npigeon, are less frequent visitors; and though the purple-breasted\r\nfruit pigeon--the most magnificent of all--talks to his mate in coarse\r\ngutturals from the trees above, he has not been seen actually drinking.\r\nSo shy and furtive a bird would choose his time for refreshment when\r\nthere is little likelihood of interruption. In the ravine there are\r\noften metallic starlings by the dozen, and little green pigeons--for\r\nthose domiciled come and go at all hours of the day. Occasionally a\r\nsulphur-crested cockatoo comes sailing down to the diminishing pool\r\nthrough interwoven leafage noiselessly as a butterfly; but scrub\r\nfowls, scared by the apparition in white, scamper off with a clatter,\r\nscattering the dead leaves. In such narrow quarters, birds are under\r\nrestraint, and show anxiety and apprehension. There is no sport or\r\nplay. They drink quickly and with faculties strained, and flutter off\r\nexcitedly on the least alarm. Well may they be suspicious, for is\r\nnot the cool spot attractive to the sly enemy, the green snake, which\r\nconceals its presence by faithful resemblance to the creepers among\r\nwhich it glides? Here, too, come millions of industrious bees, and in\r\nthe dusk the big pencil-tailed water-rat, which the masterful dog kills\r\nwith as little ceremony as he does the bird-scaring snakes.\r\n\r\nIt was late for cockatoos to start on their daily flight to the mainland\r\nfrom the big tree close to the twin palms half-way up the hill, and\r\nas they flew hastily and in close company they scolded each other in\r\nunmannerly terms. The language must have been vexing, for as they sped\r\nalong far above the passionless sea one jostled the other. It was just\r\nthe sort of action to provoke hungry, peevish birds to vindictiveness.\r\nThat which had been jostled turned on the offender with angry\r\nshrieking, and instantly a clamorous fight was in progress. Claws became\r\ninterlocked, and they fell each with distended crest, like a gilt-edged\r\ncloudlet following the setting sun. Shadow and substance met with a\r\nsplash. The sea momentarily swallowed the combatants. Then a yellow note\r\nof exclamation appeared, and with laboured flutterings, using his\r\nenemy as a base, one rose and struggled to the beach oaks. Frantic\r\nwing-beating showed that the other bird was in serious difficulties.\r\nIt was a hundred yards out, but the enjoyment of a sunbath after a sea\r\nfrolic enabled one to proceed to the rescue without preliminaries. Half\r\ndrowned and completely cowed, the bird was now confronted by a more\r\nawful peril than that of the sea. A bedraggled crest indicated horror\r\nat the steady approach of the enemy man, whose presence stimulated the\r\nsodden bird to such extraordinary efforts that it succeeded in rising\r\nand in making slow, low flight to the beach.\r\n\r\nAt dawn a bat flew into a spider's web spun during the night, the\r\nextremities of the wings being so entangled that struggling was almost\r\nimpossible. A big spider pounced on it. Not a minute elapsed from the\r\nentanglement until the bat was released, but the venom of the spider had\r\ndone its work. There was not a sign of life. The spider is dark grey\r\nin colour, bloated of body, slothful, and of most retiring disposition.\r\nHuddled up into almost spherical form, it lurks in dark places, which it\r\nsoon makes insanitary. In the open it crouches among dead leaves which\r\nhave gathered in the fork of a tree, and will construct a web which\r\nspans the coconut avenue with its stays. From one aspect its rotund body\r\ninvites a good-humoured smile, for the marking exactly simulates the\r\nfeatures of a tabby cat, well fed, sleepy, and in placid mood. Venom\r\nof virulence to kill a bat almost instantly would be severe enough to a\r\nhuman being. This dirty, obese spider deserves little consideration at\r\nthe hand of man.\r\n\r\nA moonless, cloudless night. The little praam takes the ground in the\r\nbay a few yards from the beach, and in the midst of a constellation of\r\n“jelly-fishes” spherical in form and varying in size. The larger are so\r\nmany pale blue orbs floating lazily in a luminous mist, the only visible\r\nmanifestation of life being a delicate but rhythmical deepening of the\r\ncentral hue. The wash of my wading seems not to affect them. I become\r\nconscious of the sudden appearance and swift disappearance of lesser\r\nspheres of startling brilliance. They emerge from nothingness, pause\r\nfor a moment, and shoot towards me with extraordinary impulse. Each is\r\na mere globule, resplendently blue. The tint intensifies as with\r\naccelerated velocity the atom flies until of its own excessive energy\r\nit explodes with a shell-like flash, leaving a sinuous trail of\r\ngolden light. To burst into sight, gather force, to flash and slowly\r\nvanish--such is the sum of life of a speck of sea-jelly. To be the\r\ncentre towards which scores of the watery meteors gravitate, to\r\nwitness their apparently spontaneous beginning, their swift, brief, but\r\nineffectual career and lingering end, delights this night of darkness.\r\nHow many of the race of man are there whose post-mortem glory outshines\r\nlife tenfold?\r\n\r\nBeneath a slab of dead coral on the reef there was revealed one of those\r\nprimitive and curious marine animals which has no common name, but\r\nwhich science recognises as SYNAPTA BESELLI. It is a relation of the\r\nbéche-de-mer, of snake-like form, with a group of gills differentiating\r\nthe head. Playing about it were three or four little fish which\r\nimmediately took advantage of the only remaining cover, the body of the\r\nSynapta, snoodling beside it so artfully that they were quite concealed.\r\nThe protector did not appear to resent the close company of the fish,\r\nwhich remained perfectly motionless. In a few seconds the Synapta\r\nbegan to extrude its feathery gills, which had been partly retracted on\r\ndisturbance. I counted the gills, and while my forefinger indicated the\r\nsixth, a little fish, not previously noticed, appeared at the focus\r\nand edged off to the margin of the pool, now and again making decided\r\nefforts to regain its sanctuary. It was about an inch long and a third\r\ndeep, ruby red, with pink undersides and pink, transparent fins. Three\r\nnarrow bands of silver edged with lavender extended across the shoulder.\r\nLife gave it jewel-like lustre. The companionship between the slow\r\nand feeble Synapta, one of the most primitive of sea things, and the\r\nbrilliant, agile fish may be another instance of commensalism.\r\n\r\nNo one who parades a coral reef can fail to be impressed by the various\r\nmeans adopted by its weaker denizens to evade the consequences of\r\nconspicuousness. Among the vast multitude of creatures, mostly hostile\r\nto each other, few are more remarkable than the crabs, not only on\r\naccount of form and habit, but for care of themselves during the\r\nperiodic casting of their shells. They therefore represent an\r\nentertaining study and a never-ending source of pleasure to the\r\nobserver, who, as he happens on some fantastic member of the family,\r\nwonders, remembering his Shakespeare, what impossible matter will Nature\r\nmake easy next. Dreamy little ripples were laying on the strands sprays\r\nof seaweed, torn from the reef which was not quite out of the influence\r\nof the easterly swell. The conditions were ordinary, but one fragment\r\nmade itself noticeable by slight, almost undiscernible, but still\r\ndistinctive efforts to regain the water, whence it was separated by a\r\nfew inches. Seaweed alone was visible as it rested on the palm of the\r\nhand. Presently it moved hesitatingly and with infinite slowness,\r\nand, being reversed, revealed itself as a “watery” crab under living\r\ndisguise. The specimen was sent to the Australian Museum, Sydney, where\r\nit came under the hands of my friend Mr. Allan R. McCulloch, who devotes\r\nhimself to the phenomena of the sea; and since his references to it\r\nare explicit and authoritative, they will be more acceptable than\r\ngeneralities from an uninformed pen: “The crab you sent is the second\r\nspecimen known of ZEWA BANFIELDI, which I described from a dried\r\nspecimen received from you some years ago. Not only the species, but the\r\ngenus also, was unknown until you gave me the opportunity of describing\r\nthis interesting beast. It is one of the spider crabs, or Oxyrhynchus,\r\nmost of which have long horns projecting from the rostrum, and are more\r\nor less thickly covered with stiff curled setae, to which seaweeds,\r\nsponges, and other marine growths--selected according to the taste of\r\nthe bearer--are attached. When these crabs shed their shells, which they\r\nmust do periodically to allow of growth, they retire to a dark corner\r\nand draw themselves out of a slit between the back and the abdomen,\r\nlegs and all, which must, I imagine, be a delicate and somewhat painful\r\nproceeding. After emerging, they are, of course, quite soft, and the\r\nsetae on the carapace and legs are flexible. The crab then selects\r\nchoice bits of weed from its old shell and fastens them to itself by the\r\nsetae, which soon curl at the tips like the tendrils of a vine, and so\r\nhold them firmly. The weeds and sponges, requiring no roots, but merely\r\na secure base, readily grow in their new position, and so cover their\r\nhost with a sheltering disguise, enabling it to sally forth in quest\r\nof fresh loves and other adventures. I am sending the reprint with the\r\noriginal description and figure, also a sketch of the crab with its\r\nweedy garments. Much of the weed had become detached on its arrival\r\nhere, which is, perhaps, fortunate, since the sketch would otherwise\r\nhave shown merely a cluster of weeds.” It could be well wished that the\r\nspecimen had retained the whole of its floral cloak, for then the sketch\r\nwould have shown its deceptive qualities in perfection. Masquerading as\r\na spray of seaweed, the crab eludes its enemies, the mask being of such\r\nhigh order that even man, with his perceptions, does not penetrate it\r\nunless he exercises his reasoning faculties. Because he knows that a\r\nspray of seaweed is not endowed with independent movement, when it does\r\nwalk about he, at first, is as incredulous as was Macbeth when told of\r\nthat “moving grove” of Birman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETERNAL SUNSHINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“North Queensland is my country. I love it. I live in it. I would die\r\nfor it.”--DODD S. CLARKE.\r\n\r\nTo those who earnestly believe that a country exercises dominance over\r\nits inhabitants, mental as well as physical, the present state of North\r\nQueensland offers interesting problems. Save for a fast-disappearing\r\nremnant, gone are the original occupiers of the land. The most\r\nlistless, the least thrifty of the old peoples, have given place to\r\nrepresentatives of the most adventurous, the most successful--men and\r\nwomen of British blood, of progressive ideas, vaunting and independent\r\nspirit, but with slight respect for the traditions of their race. Apt\r\nto regard their own land as all-sufficient, to resent the incoming of\r\nstrangers (especially those of dark complexion), determined to exclude\r\ncoloured labour from tropical fields, while demanding higher and yet\r\nhigher recompense for work which in other equatorial regions is deemed\r\nto be servile, on what grounds do they base the hope of adapting\r\nthemselves to their environment, of becoming children of the soil?\r\n\r\nThe genius of the race forbids degeneracy. Marked and sudden improvement\r\nmay be expected if examples drawn from the lower animals and certain\r\nplants are applicable. Huxley laid it down that “the animals and plants\r\nof the Northern Hemisphere are not only as well adapted to live in\r\nthe Southern Hemisphere as its own autochones, but are in many cases\r\nabsolutely better adapted, and so overrun and extirpate the aborigines.\r\nClearly, therefore, the species which naturally inhabits a country is\r\nnot necessarily the best adapted to its climate and other conditions.”\r\n Australian aboriginals having given way before a race better fitted\r\nto flourish, what will the future of the new race be? What ideal is at\r\npresent pursued?\r\n\r\nTo one who firmly upholds the theory of the evolution of Australian\r\ntypes, and who thinks he perceives convincing evidence in support of his\r\nbelief, it seems likely that on the tropical coast, where the influence\r\nof the sun is all-powerful, rainfall abundant, and vegetation prolific,\r\nthe type will not only be more rapidly developed, but that it will be\r\npronounced in bodily form, in tongue, and in temperament. One of the\r\nreasons compelling towards such conclusion is the decided desire--nay,\r\nthe ambition--on the part of native-born Australians to do glad and\r\nseemly homage to the sun.\r\n\r\nIf a traveller from distant and friendly lands were to accept as germs\r\nof a type those who sport in the surf at fashionable watering-places, he\r\nmight infer from the display of brown backs and shoulders that Australia\r\nhad not escaped a smudge of aboriginal blood. But this ardently\r\ncultivated tint is notoriously impermanent. Contradictory as it may be,\r\nthe most earnest advocates of the “White Australia” principle use more\r\nthan the average quantity of oil, which makes the skin to shine\r\nand embrown under the influence of the much-loved sun. Do not their\r\nshoulders bear testimony to the sun's wholesome salutations, and does\r\nnot the too fair and thin-skinned individual smart under his peeling\r\nand display envy against the favoured ones who burn to the tint of\r\nold copper? Naturally, those who have the most intense longing for a\r\ncoloured skin, who persistently seek to acquire it by exposure to\r\nthe sun seconded by anointings, will prevail. In the course of a few\r\ngenerations--it would be idle to say how many--the type will be fixed\r\nand the unguent superfluous; in the meantime the use of coco-nut oil\r\nhas become one of the confirmed customs of the country, as in Fiji and\r\nelsewhere in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIf “beauty born of murmuring sound” may enhance the charms of\r\nmaidenhood, is it too much to expect that sunburn, fervently desired,\r\nmay not only permanently darken the complexion, but affect the mien of\r\nthe race? And thus in years to come the white Australian may be of\r\nthe past--transformed physically by the supremacy of soil and sun,\r\nand improved in disposition and character by economic observances as\r\nirrefutable as the laws of Nature. The horses of out dry, stony uplands\r\nhave already developed hoofs in shape and texture well adapted to the\r\ncountry over which they roam, and have become surer-footed and more\r\nactive and durable. Conditions and circumstances which in a few\r\ngenerations effect desirable changes in horses will assuredly be\r\ninfluential in respect of the physique and stamina and moralities of\r\nman. North Queensland will establish a type, just as Tierra del Fuego\r\ndid many centuries since, and the type will be that which is best fitted\r\nto maintain itself. It will be brown of complexion, hardy and alert.\r\nNorth Queensland is expansive and varied. It comprises a marvellous\r\nrange of geological phenomena, from which may be expected remarkable\r\nvariants. The sheep-grower of the treeless downs will differ from the\r\ndenizen of the steamy coast who supplies him with sugar and bananas. The\r\nman from among the limestone bluffs may be in temperament strange to the\r\ndweller on the black soil plains and to the individual who lives among\r\nbarren hills seamed with copper. Readers of English books and magazines\r\nare familiar with the little prominence given to matters which stand for\r\ngood and worthiness and the stress laid on the seeming disadvantages of\r\nlife in tropical Australia. A favourite magazine may contain a series\r\nof articles, sumptuously illustrated, conveying information concerning\r\ncountry life in Canada. It is impossible not to visualise the miles\r\nof wheat-fields, the imposing elevators, the railways cutting across\r\nendless prairies or winding among wonderful mountains, snowcapped as a\r\nstage effect merely. The pictures of chubby children and buxom girls and\r\nsturdy boys tell of the healthfulness and invigorating qualities of the\r\nclimate. Is it not always spring or summer in Canada? Would not the man\r\nwho whispered of snow and ice be a renegade, a dastard, a rebel? North\r\nQueenslanders do not attempt to belittle the reputation of Canada as a\r\nfield for the activities of the surplus population of the old country.\r\nWe are of the same blood and breed, and merely ask for a proper\r\nunderstanding of our own good land. The comfort given to Canada is all\r\nin the family, and an Empire which extends from pole to pole must needs\r\nembrace differences of climate and productions.\r\n\r\nDo not we all take upon our shoulders the burden of Empire? Here we bear\r\nour share stripped to the buff, while Canada bustles under an equally\r\nhonourable but heavier load. Occasionally, no doubt, the most patriotic\r\nson of our Lady of Snows would joy in the heat of North Queensland noon;\r\nwhile the sweatful North Queenslander may often pant for the superfluous\r\nice of his far-away cousin.\r\n\r\nThe denizens of the different parts of the Empire quite understand\r\none another, and realise that to be great the Empire must disregard\r\ntemperatures as it does prickly heat and chilblains. Only the casual\r\nvisitor fails in this.\r\n\r\nSun Days are essential to the production of sugar and bananas and\r\nmangoes, to say nothing of pineapples and other fruits of the tropics.\r\nWhen we are called upon to endure extraordinary heat, we tell one\r\nanother of the penance and find excuse for extra drinks. But neither\r\nthe heat nor the comparison of personal experiences is of the injurious\r\nnature of some of the refreshments. The weather is not compounded of\r\nexcesses, but of means. Is it not true that few countries in the wide\r\nworld would be considered fit for habitation by human beings if the\r\ncharacter of the climate was estimated by its extremes?\r\n\r\nNo North Queenslander will resent records of high temperatures. He will\r\nbe quite content to be shown enjoying and flourishing in the heat in\r\nwhich sugar-cane thrives, for thereby is to be proved a fact theorists\r\nseem unable to grasp--viz., that such is the soundness and virtue of the\r\nBritish race that it adapts itself with equal success to the long, dark,\r\ncold winter of Canada and the perpetual summer of North Queensland.\r\nWho is to say that the Canadian in his thick woollens and furs is\r\na healthier subject, a worthier type, than the North Queenslander,\r\nstripped to the waist in the full blaze of the sun, glorying in his own\r\nvigour, proud of his magnificent heritage, and scornful of the\r\nopinions of those who have never experienced that supreme zest of life\r\nunpurchasable outside the tropic zone?\r\n\r\nWith intent to picturesquely demonstrate that soil will tell, some are\r\nready to assert that we owe Christianity to the horizontal limestone\r\nformation of Palestine. Accepting the theory with whole-hearted\r\nenthusiasm, and admitting that North Queensland comprehends tracts of\r\ncountry not dissimilar from the Holy Land, mark what the future may have\r\nin store for the race. Do you want old age?--Methuselah, Noah, Isaac.\r\nStrong men?--Gosselin, Samson, Saul. Beautiful women?--Ruth, Rebecca,\r\nEsther. Does not David, the man after God's own heart, appeal? Was not\r\nSolomon, the wise, the glorious, the prolific, a superior type? And,\r\nwith all reverence be it said, was not the Founder of the Christian\r\nreligion a solar product?\r\n\r\nHotter lands beyond the bounds of Palestine gave to the world men and\r\nwomen whose deeds and influence still astound and stimulate millions\r\nof mankind--the Queen of Sheba, Cleopatra, Pharaoh the Great, Moses the\r\nleader, whom the Lord knew face to face, Joseph the organiser, Mahomet,\r\nthe benign Buddha, and all the sages, the poets, the historians, the\r\narchitects of the gorgeous East. May not those who elect to live in\r\nlands of high temperature and who are strong in their faith cite apt\r\nand illustrious precedents, and make bold to say that none has exercised\r\nmore influence on the minds and destinies of mankind than those born in\r\nthe lands of the Sun?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGRANCE AND FRUIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant\r\nto the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise.”--Holy Writ.\r\n\r\nWhile the remnant of the crop of citrus fruits still hangs on the trees,\r\nafter providing refreshing food for six months and more, the blooms\r\nwhich promise next year's supplies decorate the branches. Is it not\r\npleasing to have such graceful promises before the burden of the passing\r\nseason has disposed of all its sweetness? Possibly these early flowers\r\nare destined to produce fruit for the admiration of living things\r\nupon which the gardener bestows anything but a welcome. It may come\r\nto maturity just after the wet season, when flies and moths feast and\r\ncorrupt in riot which provokes to wrath. Inconsequent feeders, they\r\nprobe the fruit and flit away after a sip which does not absorb a\r\nthousandth part of its keen juices, or they use a comely specimen in\r\nwhich to deposit eggs, which in the course of Nature become grubs. All\r\nsuch infected fruit the trees abandon until the ground is strewn with\r\nwaste. Such disaster happens when the air is favourable to the breeding\r\nof quivering gauze wings; but there comes a time when the fruit suffers\r\nlittle or no ill, and then the heart of the orchardist rejoices as does\r\nthat of the fisher when the wind comes up from the sea. Then does he\r\naccept fine promises in good faith, for it has come to be the fashion\r\nfor certain varieties of citrus fruits to provide two crops, and the\r\nsecond, which ripens about the beginning of August, the superior in\r\nsize, appearances generally, and distinctly in flavour. The fruit is\r\njust as juicy as that which ripens when the air is saturated with the\r\nmoisture of the wet season, while its fragrance almost equals that\r\nof the snowy flowers whence it sprang. These facts hasten to this\r\nconclusion--that the orange-grower has something beyond mere money in\r\ncompensation for his toil. Can it be called toil? Does he not for the\r\nmost part, after the first and essential preliminaries are of the past,\r\npermit Nature to have her own wayward will with his dutiful trees? Does\r\nhe always and invariably cut out the dead wood which tells of much too\r\nstrenuous efforts on their part to justify their existence and his care?\r\nDoes he attempt to exterminate the pretty flies which send to the ground\r\na certain percentage, while yet the fruit is immature and bitter? Does\r\nhe let the light of the caressing sun into the hearts of his pet trees\r\nby removing superfluous twigs? Well does he know that if he tended them\r\nas he should their bounty to him would be much magnified. Yet does\r\nhe dream on, accepting that which comes, admiring leafage, bloom, and\r\nfragrant fruit, and always postponing the day when substantial aid and\r\ncredit should be given. There is something to be said in favour of this\r\nhappy attitude towards good-natured trees. Should it not suffice to\r\nhave given them monopoly and choice? Many others, and some of far\r\nnobler proportions, have been exterminated for their special benefit and\r\nadvantage. They have been grown from seed of most highly complimented\r\nfruit; their infancy and youth have been nurtured and protected; each\r\nhas been assigned its proper place with due regard to the welfare of\r\nneighbours; less promising vegetation has been summarily checked; the\r\nfirst flowers have been sniffed with high delight, the first fruits\r\nsampled with extravagant praise. Having bestowed upon trees care and\r\nattention, while they were yet mere sprouts of tender green, and admired\r\ntheir sturdy development, and approved their best efforts, is it not\r\nyours to accept whatsoever they offer as reward and recompense for past\r\nlabour and present appreciation?\r\n\r\nFrom the artistic standpoint the most admirable of all the citrus-trees\r\nis the pomelo, which, however, lacks merit from the commercial side.\r\nThe tree grows more sedately than the orange or the mandarin, but on\r\na grander scale. The leaves are bigger, tougher, and the appendages\r\non either side of the stalk (which botanists call the stipules) more\r\ndeveloped. The blooms are greater, and endowed with a much richer\r\nperfume than the orange; the fruit is huge and fragrant, though somewhat\r\ndisappointing to the individual who expects the sweetness of the\r\nmandarin; while, if the views of the learned in such attributes are\r\ntrustworthy it possesses medicinal qualities which are foreign to its\r\ndainty, diminutive relative. It would be mere affectation to refrain\r\nfrom these compliments to the pomelo when the atmosphere is saturated\r\nwith the perfume from lusty trees. Certainly one has to wait patiently\r\nfor many a long year ere his trees greet him with white flowers which\r\npour out perfume of rare density and enrich him with golden fruit\r\nalmost as big as footballs. From nine to twelve years must elapse, but\r\nexpectancy is not wholly measurable by the arbitrariness of time. The\r\ntrue standard is the desire, tempered by the patience of the custodian\r\nof the trees.\r\n\r\nIn August the pomeloes put on their most attractive appearances. The\r\nyoung leaves of lively tint contrast with the almost sombre green of the\r\nolder foliage, and flowers in clusters give a most becoming adornment.\r\nBig and beautiful as they are, scent is their most conspicuous feature.\r\nEven in the open air it is rich almost to cloyness. It hangs about the\r\ntree while the wind is still, and the slightest movement of the air\r\nwafts it hither and thither. It stings sensitive folk with its intensity\r\nat close quarters, but when diffused is fragrance of ethereal delight.\r\nAll day long birds frolic in the trees, some to cull the nectar, some\r\nto search for insects attracted for like purpose, some to nibble and\r\ndiscard white petals. All the moist soil beneath is strewn with snowy\r\nflakes, for at night flying foxes blunder among the branches, destroying\r\nmore blooms than they eat. But why grumble? Birds which nip off petals\r\nand musty foxes which brush down whole posies in their clumsiness are\r\nbut positive checks to overproduction. Do they not avert the unthankful\r\ntask of carting away dozens of barrow loads of superfluous fruit? Last\r\nnight at dusk there was a sensation of the coming of rain, though the\r\nair was still and the sky clear. I paused under the trees to expand my\r\nlungs with their scented breathings. A semi-intoxicated bird twittered\r\ndrowsily among the branches,\r\n\r\n    “His happy good-night air,\r\n    Some blessed hope, whereof he knew,\r\n    And I was unaware.”\r\n\r\nDozens of sphinx moths--big torpedo-shaped bodies carried by wings of\r\nsoft brown and dull red--floated about, sipping where and when and as\r\nlong as they liked. Sometimes the sphinx has almost an aggressive tone\r\nIn his flight--hasty, important, brooking no interference. Last night's\r\nnote was of supreme content. A rich and overflowing feast was spread\r\nand the insects hovered over the posies and sipped and fluted like\r\nmerry roysterers, without a care or thought of the morrow. It was a\r\nlove-feast, for the still night seemed to invite the trees to give of\r\ntheir richest and best; the psalm of the insects was audible, not to the\r\ndistance whence the perfume was dissipated, but for many a scented yard.\r\nThe trees seemed sanctified, and I stood bare-headed among them and gave\r\nmy silent praise for a delightsome experience. Expectancy and patience\r\nhad been overpaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE-SHIFTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We are all going to the play or coming from it.”--DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few hours came “the season's difference.” The scene-shifter worked\r\nwith almost magical haste, with silence, and with supreme effect. The\r\ngloomy days and nights of misty hill-tops and damp hollows, where the\r\ngrass was sodden and the air dull and irresponsive to sound, gave way\r\nto bright sunshine, cloudless skies, calm seas, echoing hills, and the\r\ntinge of that which for lack of the ideal word we call “spring.” Spring\r\ndoes not visit the tropical coast, where vegetation does not tolerate\r\nany period of rest. When plants are not actually romping with excess of\r\nvital force, as during the height of the wet season, they grow with the\r\nhaste of summer. And yet immediately on the dispersal of the mists of\r\nJuly the least observance could not fail to recognise that a certain and\r\nelaborate change had taken place. The mango-trees had been flowering for\r\nseveral weeks in a trivial, half-hearted way, but when the sun sent\r\nits thrills down into the moist soil the lemons and pomeloes began to\r\nsweeten the air; the sunflower-tree displayed its golden crowns among\r\nhuge soft leaves, and the last blooms of belated wattles fell, showing\r\nthat it is possible for tributes representative of May and September to\r\nbe paid on one and the same date.\r\n\r\nThe scene-shifter came softly “as the small rain upon the tender herb,”\r\n but with an orchestra of his own. Years of observation have shown that\r\nthe weather does control the habits of some birds--birds of distinct and\r\nregular methods of life. Two such are common--the nutmeg pigeon and the\r\nmetallic starling. Both species leave this part of the North during the\r\nthird week of March, flying in flocks to regions nearer the equator.\r\nFor several weeks the starlings train themselves for the long Northern\r\nflight and its perils, dashing with impetuous speed through the forest\r\nand wheeling up into the sky until they disappear, to become visible\r\nagain as black dots hurtling through space when the sunlight plays on\r\ntheir glossy feathers as the course of the flock is changed. With the\r\nrush of a wind of small measure but immense velocity, the flock descends\r\nearthwards, among and over the trees, perfecting itself by trials of\r\nendurance and intricate alertness. The birds return during the first\r\nweek in August, in small and silent companies, to reoccupy favourite\r\nresorts in common. The nutmeg pigeons are also of exact habit, the time\r\nfor their return generally coinciding with that of the starlings. This\r\nyear (1916) both birds were noticed just after the scene-shifter had\r\nswept the hills of mists, and now other birds seem to have awakened to\r\nthe conditions which the starlings and the nutmegs brought with them\r\nfrom hotter lands. The swamp pheasants are whooping and gurgling, and\r\nthat semi-migratory fellow, the spangled drongo--a flattering name, for\r\nhe jangles but does not spangle--sits on the slim branch of the Moreton\r\nBay ash which held last year's nest and chatters discordances in the\r\nvery ears of his responsive mate. They will start building a loose nest\r\non the brittlest branch forthwith, and while the lady sits on her three\r\neggs he will screech defiances to the high heavens and perform aerial\r\ngymnastics with delirious delight.\r\n\r\nThe sun-birds are searching the lemon blooms. The breast of the gay,\r\nassertive little bird is far richer in tint than the brightest of the\r\nlemons. A minute ago one perched on a ripe fruit as if to shame it by\r\ncontrast, and the fruit has since seemed a trifle dull of tint, and with\r\nlight-hearted inconsequence the pair are now probing narrow throats of\r\npapaw flowers. The ground has been too much overgrown with grass and\r\nweeds for the comfort of the little green pigeons which come strutting\r\ndown the paths for seeds and crumbs. Dry soil, which may be easily\r\nscanned and scratched, is more to their liking, so they keep to the\r\nforest, where in some places the undergrowth of wattles is so dense that\r\nthe sun may not visit the ground, and the bare places glitter with seed.\r\n\r\nWhen rain was seriously deficient, proof was given that some proportion\r\nof the wattle seeds eaten by pigeons are not digested. In the crevices\r\nof logs supporting the water-trough, which proved to be a popular\r\nrefreshment spot of many species of birds, clamorous with thirst, seeds\r\nwere deposited, and when the rains came the trough was fringed and\r\ndecorated with pinnate leaves of sprouting wattles, some of which grew\r\nso strongly, notwithstanding the absence of soil, save that which occurs\r\nfrom the slow decay of seasoned bloodwood, that if summary measures had\r\nnot been taken the trough might have been embowered. The season seems to\r\nhave been too damp for the night-jars, though quite to the taste of\r\nall species of pigeons. In the course of a few minutes the voice of\r\nthe timid, tremulous, barred-shouldered dove came from among the\r\nyellow-flowered hibiscus of the beach, while the pheasant-tailed pigeon\r\nsounded its rich, dual note, the red-crowned fruit pigeon tolled its\r\nmournful chime, and the guttural of the magnificent fruit pigeon--often\r\nheard, but seldom seen--came from the jungle close at hand. Not one of\r\nthese birds was visible, nor was the fluty-voiced shrike thrush, which\r\nanswers every strange call and mimics crude attempts to reproduce its\r\nvaried notes. The blue kingfisher is investigating the tumour made by\r\nwhite ants in the bloodwood wherein the nest is annually excavated,\r\nand soon the chattering notes of the pair will be heard. A week ago\r\nfew signs of the approach of the scene-shifter were discernible. He\r\nhas come, and plants and birds respond to his genial and becoming\r\npresence--plants with richer growth and more abundant flowers, birds\r\nwith the unreflecting gaiety of nuptial days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACH PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Remove the vegetable kingdom, or interrupt the flow of its unconscious\r\nbenefactions, and the whole higher life of the world ends.”--HENRY\r\nDRUMMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrolling on the curving footway of broken shells and coral chips\r\nmarking the limit of the morning's tide, a vague attempt was made to\r\ncatalogue the plants which crowd each other on the verge of salt water,\r\nand so to make comparison with that part of Australia the features\r\nof which provoked Adam Lindsay Gordon to frame an adhesive phrase\r\nconcerning bright scentless blossoms and songless, bright birds.\r\nExcluding the acacias and eucalypts, said to have given sameness to\r\nthe scenes among which the exotic poet ranged, a long list might be\r\ncompiled; nor will the pleasant sounds of the afternoon be set down in\r\nformal order to the vexing of his memory, for possibly he never heard\r\nthe whoop and gurgle of the swamp pheasant or the blended voices of\r\nhundreds of nutmeg pigeons mellowed by half a mile of still, warm air.\r\n\r\nNor may such unassuming vegetation as the grasses--at least a dozen\r\nvarieties--find place in an enumeration which appeals primarily on the\r\ngrounds of prominence, though it would not do to despise the soft and\r\npleasant carpet beneath the orderly row of Casuarinas which the tide\r\nplanted during the last big cyclone with gardener's art. The common\r\nname for the trees--“she” (or “shea” oaks, as the late F. Manson Bailey\r\npreferred)--mimics the sound of the wind among the branches, which the\r\nslightest zephyr stirs and, the storm lashes into sea-like roar. The\r\nbright green of the grasses sets off the dull green and bronze of the\r\nsteadfast harps of the beach. At certain seasons and in some lights,\r\nwhen the sun is in the west, the minute scales at the joints of\r\nthe slender, pendulous branchlets shine like old gold, producing a\r\ntheatrical effect which, if not experienced before, startles and almost\r\npersuades to the belief that the complaining trees have been decorated\r\nby one who “has sought out many inventions.” But the slant of the sun\r\nalters, the light fades, leaving them sombre in hue and whispering\r\nmore and more discreetly as the night calm settles over the scene. Such\r\ncommunicable trees should stand together, commenting on passing events,\r\nbooming in unison with the cyclone, and mimicking the tenderest tones of\r\nthe idlest wind. During a storm, when the big waves crash on the beach\r\nand the Casuarinas are tormented, the tumult is bewildering; but however\r\nloud their plaint, very few suffer, though growing in loose sand; for\r\nthe roots are widespread and, like the trunk and main branches, tough,\r\nwhile the branchlets stream before the wind.\r\n\r\nClose behind the screen of Casuarinas is a magnificent specimen of a\r\nwide-spreading shrub, in form a squat dome, which commemorates the name\r\nof a French naturalist--TOURNEFORTIA ARGENTA. The leaves, crowded at\r\nthe ends of thick branchlets, are covered with soft, silky hairs of\r\na silvery cast, which reflect the sun's rays. It would be gross\r\nexaggeration to say that the finely shaped shrub shines like silver, for\r\nthe general hue of the foliage is sage green, but that it has a silvery\r\ncast, which in certain lights contrasts with the dull gold of its\r\nneighbours, is an alluring fact which must not be strained. Moreover,\r\nthe shrub covers an almost perfect circle, about thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, and since it is not more than ten feet high, its form is as if\r\nNature had designed the creation of a circus of shadow, dense and cool,\r\nfor the comfort of mankind.\r\n\r\nAt high-water mark stands one of the Terminalias with big terminal light\r\ngreen leaves, musty flowers, and purple fruit--gold, silver, and purple\r\nin close array--while over the sand the goat-footed convolvulus sends\r\nlong, succulent shoots bearing huge pink flowers complementary to the\r\npurple of the beach-pea (CANVALIA OBTUSIFOLIA).\r\n\r\nUnder the she-oaks young coral trees have sprung up, but the red flowers\r\nare of the past, and so also have the gold and white of the Calophyllums\r\ndisappeared. But in the evening the breeze brings whiffs of a singular\r\nsavour, pleasant yet not sweet, which comes from the acre or two of\r\nnative hops a few yards back. The bruised leaves thereof give off\r\nanything but an attractive odour, yet the faint natural exhalations\r\nfrom the plant are sniffed eagerly and to the revivification of pleasant\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\nAmong a crowd of massive shrubs sprawls a plant of loose habit known as\r\nCAESALPINA BONDUCELLA, the long clinging branches and the pods of which\r\nare armed with hooked prickles. It is a plant of wide range, for the\r\nbluish-grey seeds are said to be used in Arabia for necklets. In the\r\nidle days of the past the blacks were wont to enclose a single seed in\r\na miniature basket woven of strips of cane for the amusement of\r\ninfants--probably the first of rattles. It has seized for support some\r\nof the branches of a rare tree (CERBERA ODOLLAM) which bears long,\r\nglossy, lanceolate leaves, large, pink-centred, white flowers,\r\ndelicately fragrant, and compressed oval fruit, brilliantly scarlet. The\r\ntempting appearance of the fruit is all that may be said in its favour,\r\nfor it is hard and bitter, and said to be vicious in its effects on\r\nthe human system; hence the generic title, after the three-headed dog,\r\nguardian of the portals of the infernal regions.\r\n\r\nGrouped here and there are pale green, big-leaved shrubs (PREMNA\r\nOBTUSIFOLIA,) bearing flowers and fruit calling to mind the elder of\r\nthe old country. The wood is deep yellow in colour, but apparently of no\r\npractical use.\r\n\r\nAnother small tree, suggesting in its regular and well-balanced shape\r\nthe use of the pruning-knife, is GUETTARDIA SPECIOSA, the flowers of\r\nwhich are white with a tinge of pink in the centre and highly fragrant.\r\nThe fruit is a hard, woody drupe, containing small seeds. TIMONIUS\r\nRUMPHII, belonging to the same Family, but of more frequent occurrence,\r\nbears small white flowers and globular fruit. The white, finely grained\r\nwood is said to resemble English sycamore. Though harsh and flaky, the\r\nsurface of the bark seems to retain moisture, making it attractive to\r\nseveral species of fungi and epiphytal ferns, the most conspicuous of\r\nthe latter being the stag's-horn. Few of the trees near the beach are\r\nfree from such encumbrances.\r\n\r\nTo unaccustomed eyes the Pandanus palm is chief among the noticeable\r\nfeatures of the flora of the coast of tropical Queensland. Two species\r\nare represented on these accommodating sands, each suffering no ill,\r\nfrom imbibing salt water, each exhibiting the peculiarity whence the\r\ngenus derives its common name--the screw palm, the arrangement of the\r\nlong, narrow, prickle-edged leaves displaying in the most regular\r\nand demonstrative style the perfect spiral. The single stem of youth\r\nfrequently deteriorates and occasionally disappears altogether,\r\nadventitious roots, descending from various heights, forming an\r\nelaborate and sure and ever-developing support. The huge, bright\r\norange-tinted fruit of the species known as Odoratissimus is highly\r\nattractive in appearance, and to the uninitiated offers pleasing hopes\r\nand delicious expectations. It is, however, delusive, being constituted\r\nof woody drupes in close clusters collected into a globular head,\r\nwith meagre yellow pulp at the base of each group, the pulp having an\r\naromatic and unsatisfactory flavour. Each drupe contains an oblong oval\r\nkernel, pleasant to the taste, but so trivial in size as to be hardly\r\nworth the trouble of extraction unless there is little else to occupy\r\nattention save the pangs of hunger. These defects do not detract from\r\nthe parade of the tree--picturesque, singular, and replete with interest\r\nto the observer of the infinite variety of the vegetation of the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nThe cockatoo apple (CAREYA AUSTRALIS), which has several useful\r\nqualities, flourishes exceedingly. The ripe fruit, green and insipid,\r\nwas wont to be eaten by the blacks, bark from the branches was twisted\r\ninto fishing-lines, that of the roots used for poisoning fish, while\r\nthe leaves, heated over the fire until the oil exuded, were applied to\r\nbruised and aching parts of the body. Extraordinary tenacity of life\r\ndistinguished the tree, the axe, fire, and poison failing under some\r\ncircumstances to vanquish it.\r\n\r\nAnother and closely related member of the same Family (Myrtaceae)\r\nis BARRINGTONIA SPECIOSA, which, so far as local experience is to be\r\ntrusted, is restricted to the beaches, growing lustily in pure sand\r\nat the very verge of high-water mark. The glossy leaves of this\r\nmany-branched tree often exceed a foot in length; the flowers, too,\r\nare large and singular in style, the petals being comparatively\r\ninsignificant, while the numerous stamens attain a length of four inches\r\nand are of a lovely shade of red. Like its relative, the cockatoo apple,\r\nthe flowers of the Barringtonia have a meaty smell, which seems to\r\nattract many species of insects. In keeping with other characteristics,\r\nthe fruit is large, consisting of a thick, woody covering, as if Nature\r\ndesigned that the single seeds should be adequately protected during a\r\nprotracted oceanic drift. It is often cast up on the sand, but the seed\r\ndoes not germinate as consistently as that of the cannon-ball-tree; but\r\nwhen it does it rarely fails to become established.\r\n\r\nTwo species of Ficus deserve to be mentioned, though this catalogue does\r\nnot claim to be exhaustive. FICUS FASCICULATA, as the title implies,\r\nbears its inedible fruit in bundles, branches, trunk, and exposed roots,\r\nbeing alike fertile, and is almost as retentive of life as the cockatoo\r\napple. Opposita is remarkable for varied form of foliage, referred to\r\nparticularly elsewhere, and for the sweetness of its fruit.\r\n\r\nOne of the loveliest and most remarkable plants of the beach is the\r\nseacoast laburnum (SOPHORA TOMENTOSA), with its pinnate leaves of sage\r\ngreen, hoary with silvery fur as soft as seal-skin, and bearing terminal\r\nspikes of golden flowers with scent invoking slight comparison with\r\nmignonette. The thick, silky leaves, the yellow flowers, and the strange\r\npods, are distinctive qualities, which atone for the absence of the\r\nspecial sweetness of the garden favourite. The pods begin as slender,\r\nsilvery, dangling threads, which speedily lengthen and become\r\nconstricted. When the breeze flusters the shrubs, revealing the\r\nundersides of the leaves at a reflective angle and shaking the tasselled\r\npods, and the splashes of gold sway hither and thither, the character\r\nof the shrub as one of the most attractive ornaments of the beach is\r\nso truly displayed that it might be likened to the tree of the sun\r\ndescribed by Marco Polo--green on one side, but white when perceived on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThis quality, however, is not special or peculiar. The brown kurrajong\r\n(COMMERSONIA ECHINATA) exhibits it even more conspicuously, and, when\r\nthe dusty white flowers--displayed in almost horizontal planes--are\r\nbuffeted by the winds and the white undersides of the leaves are\r\nrevealed, the whole style of the tree is transformed as a demure damsel\r\nis by tempestuous petticoats.\r\n\r\nWith the grey-green of the Sophora is often intertwined the leafless\r\ncreeper CASSYTHA FILIFORMIS, which in the days of the past the blacks\r\nwere wont to use with other beach plants in the composition of a crude\r\nseine net. The long-reaching, white-flowered CLERODENDRON INERME and the\r\ntough, sprawling BLAINVILLEA LATIFOLIA, with its small, harsh flowers,\r\nyellow as buttercups but resembling a daisy in form, were also embodied\r\nin the net.\r\n\r\nThe Poonga oil-tree, the new and old leaves the colour of new copper,\r\nand the mature the darkest of green, bears spikes of pale lavender\r\nflowers, and makes a decided blotch among the light green succulent\r\nleaves of the native cabbage (SCAEVOLA KOENIGII), with its strange white\r\nflowers and milk-white fruit. All parts of the plant are said to be\r\nemetic.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of VITEX TRIFOLIA, each bearing pretty lavender flowers,\r\nbut in other respects sharply contrasted, are among the commonest of\r\ndenizens of the beach. The one is a prostrate plant with sage-coloured\r\nand sage-scented leaves; the other a shrub or small tree with light\r\ngreen foliage, the underside of which is mealy-white, and flowers paler\r\nthan those of its lowly kin. Each is pretty, and the creeping variety\r\n(known in Egypt as the “Hand of Mary”) decidedly one of the most eager\r\nlovers of the sand, to which it keeps strictly.\r\n\r\nAlmost within reach from high water are representatives of a tall,\r\nshining-leaved shrub known as MORINDA CITRIFOLIA, the flower-heads of\r\nwhich merge into a berry which has a most disagreeable odour and a still\r\nmore objectionable flavour. It is related that when La Perouse was cast\r\naway on one of the islands of the South Pacific, a native undertook\r\nto ward off the pangs of hunger by converting the fruit into an\r\nedible dish. But his manipulation seemed but to intensify original\r\nnauseousness, and the brave Frenchman and his companions found\r\nsemi-starvation more endurable than the repugnant mess.\r\n\r\nMagnificent representatives of the umbrella-tree (BRASSAIA\r\nACTINOPHYLLA), unique among the many novelties of the tropical coast,\r\nare massed in groups or stand in solitary grace close to the sea.\r\nQueensland has a monopoly over this handsome and remarkable tree, the\r\ngenus to which it belongs being limited to a single species occurring\r\nnowhere else in a native state. Discovered by Banks and Solander at\r\nCooktown in 1770, the second record of its existence, it is believed,\r\nwas made from specimens obtained on this island by Macgillivray and\r\nHuxley in 1848. Possibly the very trees which attracted their attention\r\nstill crown their rayed and glossy leaflets with long, radiating rods\r\nthickly set with red, stud-like flowers. Such foliage and such flowers\r\nwould appeal gloriously to an enthusiastic botanist, and to so devoted,\r\nindefatigable, and successful a searcher after the wonders and the\r\nhigher truths of the world as Huxley.\r\n\r\nFew of the ornaments of the beach are more noticeable than that known\r\ncommonly as the sunflower-tree and by the natives as Gingee (DIPLANTHERA\r\nTETRAPHYLLA), with its big leaves, soft of surface when young, but harsh\r\nand coarse at maturity. The golden flowers, grouped in huge heads, are\r\nrich in nectar, attracting birds and butterflies by day and flying foxes\r\nat night. The fruit, enclosed in a crisp capsule, is tough and leathery,\r\nin shape a flattened oval, and is entirely covered with silken seeds\r\nlying close and dense as the feathers of the grebe. When numbers of the\r\ncapsules open simultaneously, the seeds float earthwards like a silvery\r\nmantle or stream before the wind like a veil. Rarely the capsule falls\r\nto the ground complete, and then the parting of the valves reveals the\r\nfruit, in form not unlike a small fish covered with glistening scales.\r\nThe soft white wood is generally condemned, but duly seasoned it becomes\r\ntough, and is durable when not exposed to the weather. Like other\r\nquick-growing trees, the Gin-gee takes no long time in arriving at\r\nmaturity, and its life is comparatively brief. Often big trees die from\r\nno apparent cause, and the wood becoming dry and tindery, the limbs\r\ncrash to the ground suddenly, and in a few months the whole substance\r\ndisappears in dust and mould.\r\n\r\nThough the flowering season of the Calophyllum is of the past, the tree\r\nwhich bestows on the beaches the deepest shade and is handsome in all\r\nits parts must not be disregarded, for does it not, ever and anon,\r\nstrive after a higher purpose than the production of goodly leaves,\r\nwhite flowers, and nuts “harsh and crude”? On rare occasions the\r\nexternal covering of the nut turns yellow on the tree, and is then found\r\nto enclose a thin envelope of pulp of aromatic and rather gratifying\r\nflavour. Such a phenomenon seems to manifest inherent excellencies, a\r\nlaudable effort towards self-improvement, a plea for assistance on the\r\npart of some approving and patient man, an indication of the lines on\r\nwhich he might co-operate. The tree does not need gloss for its perfect\r\nleaves or fragrance for its flowers, nor need the qualities of its pink\r\nwood of wavering figure be extolled. With the exception of the stamens,\r\nall parts of the inflorescence, inclusive of the long pedicles, are\r\nmilk-white, and the perfume is as sweet and refreshing as an English\r\nspring posy. Chemists tell us that the oil from the kernels contains a\r\ngreen pigment which changes to yellow on saponification, and that the\r\nresin is emetic and purgative, and healing when applied as plaster.\r\nIf botanical science can develop the meritorious tendencies the fruit\r\noccasionally exhibits, the Calophyllum would certainly rank as one of\r\nthe most wonderful of all tropical fruits. And may it not be wise to\r\nindulge the highest hopes when it is borne in mind that at the head\r\nof the Family to which the Calophyllum belongs stands that queen of\r\nfruits--the mangosteen? Faith in the probable idealisation of the\r\nCalophyllum is justified by reference to the “Prefatory and Other Notes”\r\n to the late F. M. Bailey's great work, the “Comprehensive Catalogue of\r\nQueensland Plants,” where is to be found these encouraging words: “When\r\nany particular plant is said to furnish a useful fruit, it must not be\r\nimagined that the fruit equals the apple, pear, or peach of the present\r\nday, but all so marked are superior to the fruits known to our far-back\r\nforefathers.”\r\n\r\nTwo eucalypts--bloodwood and Moreton Bay ash (CORYMBOSA and TESSELLARIS\r\nrespectively)--and two acacias are represented, the former developing\r\ninto great trees of economic value, the latter being comparatively\r\nshort-lived and ornamental. The young shoots of Acacia flavescens are\r\ncovered as with golden fleece, and its globular flowers are pale yellow.\r\nThe wood resembles in tint and texture its ally, the raspberry-jam wood\r\nof Western Australia, though lacking its significant and remarkable\r\naroma. ACACIA AULACOCARPA displays in pendant masses golden tassels rich\r\nin fragrance.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-flowered hibiscus (cotton-tree) overhangs the tide, and the\r\nsmall-leaved shrub the blacks name Tee-bee (WIKSTRAEMIA INDICA), the\r\npink, semi-transparent fruit of which is eaten in times of stress,\r\nsprings from pure sand.\r\n\r\nA tall, almost branchless shrub (MACARANGA TANARIUS), the Toogantoogan\r\nof the natives, grows in close clumps conducive to the production of\r\nlight, straight, slim stems used as fish-spears. The bark peels readily\r\nin long strands, easily convertible into lines, and the sap from incised\r\nstems, which crystallises with a reddish tint, is a fast cement. Huge\r\nplatter-shaped leaves are supported on long stalks from nearly the\r\ncentre, whence radiate prominent nerves of pale green. Some plants\r\nexhibit leaf-stalks of ruby red, with central leaf-spot and nerves like\r\nin hue, producing the most beautiful effect. If the growth of the plant\r\ncould be kept within bounds it would be gladly admitted as a garden\r\nshrub. The stems and the base of the leaf-stalk are coated with,\r\nglaucous bloom, like that of a ripe plum. The bloom, easily to be rubbed\r\noff, is said to derive its title from that Glaucus who took part in the\r\nTrojan War and had the simplicity, or the wisdom, to exchange his suit\r\nof golden armour for one of iron.\r\n\r\nThe length of the beach thus casually examined is not more than a\r\nquarter of a mile long, and no plant mentioned is more than a few yards\r\nfrom high-water mark, the soil being almost pure sand. Imagine some\r\nthree square miles of country varied by hills and flats of rich soil,\r\nwith creeks and ravines, precipices and bluffs, dense jungle and thick\r\nforest, hollows wherein water lodges in the wet season, and granite\r\nridges, and then endeavour to comprehend the botany of one small island\r\nof the tropical coast!\r\n\r\nTo obtain demonstration of the vitalising and nourishing principles in\r\nmaritime sands under the effects of heat, light, and moisture, it\r\nis necessary to retrace our steps and walk round the sandspit to the\r\ntransfigured and degenerate mouth of that once mangrove-creek known to\r\nthe blacks by a name signifying that a boy once tethered in it a sucking\r\nfish (Remora). Obstructed by a bank, the creek is dead and dry save when\r\nthe floods of the wet season co-operate with high tides and effect a\r\nbreach, to be repaired on the cessation of the rains. No more than four\r\nyears have passed since the formation of the bank began. It is now a\r\nshrubbery made by the incessant and tireless sea from materials hostile,\r\ninsipid, and loose-sand, shells, and coral debris, with pumice from some\r\nfar-away volcano. On this newly made, restricted strip one may peep and\r\nbotanise without restraint, discovering that though it does not offer\r\nconditions at all favourable to the retention of moisture, plants of\r\nvaried character crowd each other for space and flourish as if drawing\r\nnutriment from rich loam.\r\n\r\nSeveral botanical Families are represented, the genera and species\r\nbeing:\r\n\r\n   Casuarina equisetifolia (she-oak)\r\n   Avicennia officinalis (white mangrove).\r\n   Clerodendron inerme.\r\n   Premna obtusifolia.\r\n   Vitex trifolia.\r\n   Vitex trifolia, var. obovata.\r\n   Carapa moluccensis (cannon-ball-tree).\r\n   Erylhrina indica (coral-tree).\r\n   Sophora tomentosa (sea-coast laburnum).\r\n   Pongamia glabra (poonga oil-tree).\r\n   Vigna luteola (yellow-flowered pea).\r\n   Calophyllum inophyllum (Alexandrian laurel).\r\n   Terminalia melanocarpa.\r\n   Ximenia americana (yellow plum).\r\n   Scoevola koenigii (native cabbage).\r\n   Hibiscus tiliaceus (cotton-tree).\r\n   Wikstroemia indica. Macaranga tanarius.\r\n   Euphorbia eremophilla (caustic bush).\r\n   Dodonaea viscosa (hop-bush).\r\n   Passiflora foetida (stinking passion fruit).\r\n   Ipomea pes caprae (goat-footed convolvulus).\r\n   Ionidium suffruticosum, Form A.\r\n   Ionidium suffruticosum, Form B (spade-flower).\r\n   Blainvillea latifolia.\r\n   Gnaphalium luteo-album (flannel-leaf or cud-weed).\r\n   Vernonia cinerea (erect, fluffy-seeded weed).\r\n   Remirea maritima (spiky sand-binder).\r\n   Cyperus decompositus (giant sedge).\r\n   Erigeron linifolius (cobbler's pegs or rag-weed).\r\n   Tribulus terrestris (caltrops).\r\n   Triumfetta procumbens (burr).\r\n   Salsola kali (prickly salt-wort).\r\n   Mesembryanthemum aequilaterale (pig's face).\r\n   Anthistria ciliata (kangaroo-grass).\r\n   Paspalum distichum (water couch-grass).\r\n   Zoysia pungens (coast couch-grass).\r\n   Lepturus repens (creeping wire-grass).\r\n   Panicum leucophaeum (pasture-grass).\r\n   Andropogon refractus (barbed wire-grass).\r\n   Tragus racemosus (burr-grass).\r\n   Eragrostis brownii, var. pubescens (love-grass).\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some of the grasses and two noxious weeds, this\r\nassemblage is representative of plants which grow just beyond the\r\nsweep of the waves, and are prosperously at home nowhere else. One,\r\nthe cannonball-tree, is so highly specialised that its presence is but\r\ntemporary, for it endures but a single set of conditions--saline mud\r\nand the shade of mangroves. The thick, leathery capsule contains several\r\nirregularly shaped seeds, somewhat similar to Brazil nuts, but larger in\r\nsize and not to be reassembled readily after separation. When stranded,\r\ngermination is prompt, but the young plants, lacking essential\r\nconditions, invariably perish. One of the trailers--the caltrops--has\r\ntrilobed, saw-edged leaves (harsh on both sides), yellow flowers of\r\nunpleasant odour, and fruit which, perhaps, formed the model of the war\r\nweapon of the time of the Crusaders. In whatever position it rests on\r\nthe ground it presents an array of spikes to the bare foot. Though\r\nall its superficial qualities are graceless, it performs the admirable\r\noffice of binding sand, and thus prepares the way for benign and\r\nfaultless vegetation.\r\n\r\nThat his garden might not only be instructive but profitable to mankind,\r\nNeptune heaved on to its verge three coco-nuts, the goose-barnacles on\r\ntwo of which bore testimony to a long drift. That which retained the\r\ngerm of life fell into the hands of a visiting black boy, who split it\r\nopen to feast on the pithy and insipid “apple” within its shell at\r\nthe base of the sprout. This mischance ruined for the time being the\r\nprospect of a fine effect; but the perseverance and prodigality of\r\nNeptune none may estimate. He will certainly bring from distant\r\ndomain another nut which may escape the observation of the\r\nnever-to-be-satisfied black boys until the young plant itself has\r\nassimilated its concentrated food, and begins to spread its glossy\r\nfronds in the face of the sun. In the meantime the garden displays four\r\nweeds, two of the nature of pests, two of discomfort merely; ornamental,\r\nscented, and flowering shrubs, and trees promising to be conspicuous and\r\npicturesque, so that credit is to be divided--the sea made the site, the\r\nadjacent land provided all the becoming plants.\r\n\r\nWhat are the elements in this primitive spot which afford nutriment\r\nto vegetation of such varied character? Probably there are few of the\r\nbeaches of islands within the Great Barrier Reef on which the majority\r\nof the plants do not exist. It is typical, therefore, not of isolated\r\nexperiments on the part of Nature, but of conditions and processes\r\nrepeated in similitude wheresoever in the region raw sand heals the\r\nwounds inflicted by the sea or the grumbling sea retreats before the\r\nsibilant, incessant sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADOWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The wish--that ages have not yet subdued--In man to have no master save\r\nhis mood.”\r\n\r\n                                   BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of the obscuring grey of these wet-season days, when\r\nthe tranquil sea absorbed the lustrous blue of the sky, I discovered\r\nmyself day-dreaming for a blissful moment or two ere the crude anchor of\r\nthe flattie slipped slowly to the mud twelve feet below. The rough iron\r\nand rusty chain cast curious crinkled shadows, and presently, as the\r\niron sank into the slate-coloured mud and the chain tightened, the\r\nshadow was single but infirm. Light and the magic of the sea, which,\r\nthough it takes its ease, is forbidden absolute rest, transformed\r\nit until imagination created similitude to a serpent in its natural\r\nelement. Its half-concealed, formless head was verified by a flake of\r\nrust just where a watchful eye might have been, and the sun played upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo here at last was the sea-serpent with alert eye and without end. It\r\nwas all so realistic and endowed with such benignity and such gentleness\r\nof motion that I gazed at it with the gladness of a discoverer. In\r\nresponse to a slight motion of the hand, the sea-serpent wriggled as\r\nthough in haste; but wriggle as it might the end never came.\r\n\r\nThe boat drifted back. The serpent became seriously elongated, but\r\nthough the beginning was now a grey blotch in the mud, the end was not.\r\nI might beat up a little foam with the chain, and see below a giddy\r\ndance or at least lively flourishes and swaying. Yet there was something\r\nlacking--the end. But for that very commonplace default did there not\r\nhere exist a very good beginning for another romance of the sea?\r\n\r\nThe phantom, born of light and limpid salt water and iron into which\r\nrust had deeply gnawed, gave zest to the pursuit of shadows. What is\r\ncommoner under the tropic sun? The boat was now over the sand of the\r\nsteeply shelving beach, where the water takes the tint of the chrysolite\r\nand creatures of fairy lightness come into view. Often on still days\r\nsmall sea-spiders sport under the lea of the boat, each of the eight\r\nlegs supported by a bubble. With astonishing nimbleness, the spider\r\nslips and glides over the surface as a man in laborious snow-shoes over\r\nthe snow. Having basked in the sun and frolicked with its kind, the\r\nspider abandons its pads, takes to its hairy bosom a bubble of air,\r\nand dives below. The shadows, not the spiders alone, gave pleasing\r\nentertainment. Each vague shadow and the eight bubble-shod feet formed\r\na brooch-like ornament on the yellow sand--a grey jewel surrounded by\r\ndiamonds, for every bubble acted as a lens concentrating the light. When\r\nthe frail creatures darted hither and thither--the majestic sun does not\r\ndisdain to lend his brilliance to the most prosaic of happenings--the\r\nshadows of the bubbles became jewels or daylight lightnings. The hour\r\nwas so restful, the light so searching, that many of the spiders, long\r\nof leg and pearly-grey of body, gathered about the boat, the shade\r\nof which seemed to be grateful. A wave of the hand dispersed the gay\r\nassemblage, but in a few seconds the playful creatures--not too easily\r\nto be deprived of their place in the sun--reappeared from nowhere,\r\nand the beads and flashes on the floor of old Ocean once more began to\r\nglitter.\r\n\r\nSmall, slim fish took shelter from the intense light. Some hung\r\nmotionless in the water; others nibbled daintily the green and lazy\r\nslime on the batten at the bilge, their gently waving shadows being\r\nbarely perceptible, for their delicate, semi-transparent bodies absorbed\r\nbut the merest particle of the brightness of noonday.\r\n\r\nThe unnoticeable swing of the tide took the responsive boat out from\r\nthe beach, and again the serpent swayed sleepily. Down in the mud an\r\norganised conflict was taking place between a tiny soft-bodied crab\r\nand four molluscs which used whip-like tentacles with unceasing energy,\r\nwhile the crab defended itself with ever-ready claws. Borne down by\r\nnumbers, it sank into the mud, the energy of the victors creating a\r\ntiny spiral of slush. A huge stingray passed on its way, the edges of\r\nextended wings rippling never so gently, its shadow half the size of the\r\nboat; and presently, with ghostly glide, a dull-skinned shark came into\r\nview with motion so steady and apparently effortless that it might have\r\nbeen a spectre. The pectoral fins swayed listlessly. The swirl of the\r\ntail was as tender as a caress. Passing the boat a few yards, it turned\r\nwith a gracious sweep and nestled in its shade, and, though motionless,\r\nit was wide awake. The eyes on each end of the projecting extremities of\r\nthe head blinked up at the boat. It was comfortable, but suspicious. Was\r\nits conscience quite clear? The hammer-head has not the reputation\r\nof being an active enemy of man. Why should it be distrustful? This\r\nhammer-head would not sleep in the shadow, so let it be made aware of\r\nthe serpent. I took hold of the chain cautiously, the shark watching,\r\nand with a quick turn of the wrist the docile serpent lashed\r\noffensively. Then did the shark, frightened of a shadow, flee with\r\nmud-stirring haste, like the wicked when no man pursueth.\r\n\r\nThe hour of day-dreaming was past. I slip over the side of the boat to\r\nroll and splash in tepid water limpid almost to invisibility, and to\r\ntest the wondrous buoyancy of the substantial part of man. Sit down, the\r\nlips just awash, so that the accurately ballasted portion cushions on\r\nthe cleanly sand. Stretch out the legs so that the heels barely rest.\r\nHead thrown back and arms extended, fill the lungs to their utmost\r\ncapacity with the placid, revivifying air, and you will find yourself so\r\nuplifted that the heels alone gently touch the sand. At each inspiration\r\nalmost sufficient air is imbibed to float the whole bulk and machinery\r\nof the body. And when the radiant air is all one's own, why be\r\nniggardly? Let it be gulped greedily, strongly, wilfully, and let the\r\nsmiling sea, responding to the embraces of your widespread arms, salute\r\nyour lips with ripples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SMILING MORN”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The light of the morning, When the sun riseth, even a morning without\r\nclouds; As the tender grass springing out of the earth By clear shining\r\nafter rain.”\r\n\r\n                                         Holy Writ.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cloudless sky, the long grass wet with the night's gentle shower,\r\na thin veil of mist on the hills, a glassy, steel-blue sea, the air\r\nsaturated with the essences from myriads of leaves and scented with\r\nthe last whiffs from the tea-trees and the primal blossoms of the\r\nwattles--such are the features of this smiling morn.\r\n\r\nA spangled drongo--ardent lover of light and free air--talkatively\r\nannounced the dawn long before its coming; the noisy pitta--bird of the\r\nmoist soil and leafy gloom--triumphs in three notes. For an hour the\r\nscrub fowl have been violently noisy, but have retired to the recesses\r\nof the jungle, whence comes an occasional chuckle of satisfaction or\r\na coarse, triumphant crow. The fasciated honey-eater has loudly called\r\n“with a voice that seemed the very sound of happiness”; the leaden\r\nflycatcher, often silent but seldom still, has twittered and whispered\r\nplaintively; the sun-birds are playing gymnastics among the lemon\r\nblossoms, and the centre of activity for butterflies is the red-flowered\r\nshrub bordering the wavering path.\r\n\r\nSince--sometimes wantonly, often thoughtlessly--man interferes with\r\nplants, time out of mind the banqueting-table of the butterflies, is\r\nit not a duty to provide substitutes for devastated natural vegetation?\r\nWhen it is discovered that a plant, introduced to give satisfaction to\r\nthe lust of the eye, provides from year's end to year's end nectar as\r\nunfailing as the widow's cruse of oil, is it not becoming to reproduce\r\nit plentifully so that excited and virtuous insects may be encouraged\r\nto return to former scenes? If not a duty, at least it is a source of\r\nhappiness, for the particular insects which revel in the nectar of the\r\nperpetually flowering shrub are the two most gorgeous butterflies of the\r\nland--pleasantly known as Ulysses and Cassandra.\r\n\r\nScience changes its titles so frequently that unless the intellect is\r\nto be increasingly burdened it is well to refuse to be divorced from\r\nthe old and often explicit and fulfilling names. Cassandra is the lovely\r\ngreen and gold fly which dances in the air so delightfully when he\r\nwoos his sober, fluttering mate. That of gorgeous royal blue with black\r\nedging to the wings and dandyish swallow-tails, which wanders far and\r\nwide and flies high and swiftly, is Ulysses.\r\n\r\nThis glorious morn the ruddy shrub is as lively as a merry-go-round with\r\nthe feasting and antics of flitting gems, and there are others by the\r\ndozen attentive to less seductive fare. For half an hour the courtship\r\nof a perfect Ulysses has interfered with the staid ways of those not\r\nin holiday humour. Unlike Cassandra, there is little in appearance to\r\ndistinguish the sexes, nor in the wooing does the dame exhibit staid\r\ndemeanour. The object of Ulysses' love is almost, if not quite,\r\nas brilliantly decorated as himself. She is not, therefore, to be\r\nfascinated by the display of blue no more lustrous than that of her\r\nown proud wings. He may flit and toss about her, but she seems to take\r\nscanty notice of his affected aerial limpings. Her raiment is just as\r\nbrave, and she has swallow-tails too. The wider black margin on her\r\nwings is no badge of subserviency, but rather an additional charm\r\ninciting tremulous fascination. She may soar over the mango-trees with\r\nease as careless as his, and slide down straight to the red flowers\r\nwith like certainty. She is not to be bewildered by his gyrations, nor\r\nthrilled by mock hostile swoops. However sprightly his activities,\r\nshe has a mood to correspond and power to mimic. Indeed, is she not\r\nindifferent?--so much on an equality with him that she might say:\r\n\r\n“If thou thinkest I am too easily won, I'll frown and be perverse, and\r\nsay thee nay.”\r\n\r\nMight she not say more at the moment, since her airs are those of\r\nindependence? Possibly she imagines hers to be the superior sex. Is she\r\nto be distinguished from her wooer as she flits from him disdainfully?\r\nCan she not imitate his most audacious feats? Ah! but for how long may\r\nshe restrain primal emotions? The blue-mantled dandy understands his\r\nart. His wings beat with the passion of the dominant lover. He tosses\r\nhimself before her, impeding her flight until she imitates his antics.\r\nTossing is not the privilege of his sex. She exercises her right to\r\ntoss, and the pair toss in delightful but bewildering confusion, like\r\njewels sent skyward by a conjurer. And thus having established her\r\nrights if not her equality, she consents to play the part Nature\r\ndecrees, and the pair tumble and toss over the mango-trees, while half a\r\ndozen others sip contentedly the red flowers.\r\n\r\nMany other winged creatures flit and glisten in the garden and down\r\nalong the grass-invaded path between the coco-nuts. Dragon-flies hover\r\nover the moist spots, transparent wings carrying coral-red bodies,\r\nand two sand-wasps pilot my steps, following the narrow ribbon of bare\r\nground as a fish the course of a shallow stream, buzzing ominously as if\r\nin warning of some possible mischance. They are friends, and will in a\r\nmoment swerve, and boom back to the shafts they have excavated in sand\r\nas depositaries for their eggs, and into which they will pack living\r\ncaterpillars as fresh food for their young. They dig with such deftness\r\nand vigour that the sand is expelled in a continuous jet. When the mouth\r\nof the shaft, round to exactness, is lumbered with soil, the insect\r\nemerges backward and shovels away dog-like with its forelegs. Then it\r\ndisappears again, until the sand-jet has made another encumbering heap.\r\n\r\nThese alert and furiously resentful insects are endowed with\r\nresourcefulness and “intelligence” in keeping with their physical\r\nactivities. One had foraged a caterpillar in bulk and weight beyond\r\nits flight strength, and was, therefore, compelled to haul it along the\r\ntoilful earth. On the wing the wasp finds its home unhesitatingly. On\r\nthe unfamiliar ground it lost its bearings, and, moreover, the lumbering\r\ncaterpillar had to be tugged through a bewildering forest of grass\r\nstems, among which it went astray. During a pause the wasp surveyed the\r\nscene, and, locating the shaft, after stupendous exertions deposited\r\nits prey conveniently thereto, to find itself confronted with a problem,\r\nsince the diameter of the caterpillar exceeded that of the shaft.\r\nIt seemed to reflect for a few moments, and then with feverish haste\r\nenlarged the shaft. Another difficulty had then to be overcome. Was it\r\npossible to force such a bulky and unwieldy body head first down--the\r\nhabitual way? The insect came to a rapid decision in the negative.\r\nBacking into the shaft, it seized the caterpillar by the head and drew\r\nit down, presently emerging, and how it managed to squeeze past so tight\r\na plug is another of the magics of the morn. Having butted with its\r\nhighly competent head the caterpillar well home, the wasp selected\r\na neatly fitting stone as a wad, and, filling the shaft with earth,\r\nstrewed the surface with grass fragments, to the artistic concealment of\r\nthe site.\r\n\r\nOn the beach is another industrious winged miner which has not learned\r\nthe art of the rapid evacuation of the spoil, but follows the slower\r\nways of the crab, carrying the sand in a pellet between the forelegs,\r\nand as it backs out jerking it rearward until a tidy heap is made. But\r\nit is a fussy worker, so charged with nervous energy that its glittering\r\nwings quiver even while down in the depths of its shaft, as you may\r\nassure yourself if you hearken attentively when neither the sea nor air\r\nmakes competitive noises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCESTRAL SHADE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Time was when, settling on thy leaf, a fly Could shake thee to the\r\nroot--and time has been When tempests could not.”\r\n\r\n                                       COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to recall the spirits of the departed of this Isle\r\nto solemn session and to exact from them expression of opinion as to\r\nthe central point of it, the popular, most comfortable and convenient\r\ncamping-place, there can be no question that the voice of the majority\r\nwould favour the curve of the bay rendered conspicuous by a bin-gum\r\nor coral tree. Within a few yards of permanent fresh water, on sand\r\nblackened by the mould of centuries of vegetation, close to an almost\r\ninextricable forest merging into jungle, whence a great portion of the\r\nnecessaries of life were obtained, and but ten paces from the sea,\r\nthe tree stood as a landmark, not of soaring height, but of bulk and\r\ncomeliness withal.\r\n\r\nGeneration after generation of careless coloured folk must have been\r\nborn and bred under its branches. When the soil became rank because of\r\ncontinuous residence and insects of diabolical activity pestered its\r\noccupants, the camp would shift to another site; but there existed\r\nproofs that the bin-gum-tree localised the thoughts of those aimless,\r\nunstable wanderers to whom a few bushes stuck in the sand as a screen\r\nfrom prevailing winds represent the home of the hour and all that the\r\nword signifies and embodies. Many a one was laid to rest beneath its\r\nspreading branches, for it was the custom of the pre-white folk's days\r\nto swathe the dead in frail strips of bark, knees to chin, and place the\r\nstiffened corpse in a shallow pit in the humpy which had been in most\r\nrecent occupation. If the dead during life had possessed exceptional\r\nqualities, burial rites would be ceremonious and prolonged. With tear\r\nand blood stained faces (for the mourners enforced grief by laceration\r\nof the flesh) incidents in the admirable career of the departed would\r\nbe rehearsed in pantomime. The enactment of scenes from the life of the\r\nhunter and fighter might occupy hours. The art of the canoe or sword\r\nmaker would be graphically mimicked. The life of the woman found\r\nrehearsal from infancy until she passed from the protection of her\r\nfather into the arms of her lover. If she had died childless, a\r\nprotesting infant or an effigy in bark would be placed on her shrunken\r\nbosom, so that she might not suffer the reproach of matrons who had\r\npreceded her to the mysterious better country.\r\n\r\nThe ancestral shade was a birth-place, an abiding-place, a cemetery,\r\nand the soil grew ever richer, and the thick-trunked tree displayed its\r\nruddy flowers and gave of its best in nectar for birds and butterflies\r\nand gauze-winged, ever-flitting creatures.\r\n\r\nIt was not a comfortable tree to climb, for its grey-green branches were\r\nstudded with wens each armed with a keen prickle, long and tough. It\r\noffered the hospitality of its shade to man, but little else, save\r\nflowers to gladden his eyes, though it stood as a perpetual calendar, or\r\nrather floral harbinger, of some of the most excellent things in life.\r\nAt a certain season its big, trilobed, hollow-stalked leaves changed\r\nfrom bright green to pale yellow and lingeringly fell, and often before\r\nthe last disappeared, flower-buds registered the date with almost\r\nalmanac exactitude. Then, as the rich red began to glow here and there,\r\nand impatient small birds to assemble in anticipation of the annual\r\nfeast, the old inhabitants of the Isle would comfort one another with\r\nreminiscences of the “Oo-goo-ju,” the nutmeg pigeon, which was wont to\r\ncongregate in such numbers that adjacent and easily accessible isles\r\nwere whitened. There would be plenty of eggs then, and in a few weeks\r\nsquabs quiveringly, helplessly fat.\r\n\r\nIt was a good tree, for it gave good tidings, and it centralised the\r\nshelter of the Isle. Its blooms were delightfully, dashingly red, and\r\nthey lasted long--that is, if the camp--the soil rectified by sun\r\nand rain--happened to be in residence, for then the sulphur-crested\r\ncockatoos would be scared. Otherwise the profligate birds would sever\r\nthe heavy racemes of flower in their eagerness for honey until the\r\nground beneath glowed with a furnace-hued shadow. But there would be\r\nstill plenty for the gay sun-birds and the honey eaters, while the grey\r\ngoshawk would make the site of regular call, for the bibulous lesser\r\nbirds could not always be on the alert, ready to dart into adjacent\r\ntea-trees. The hawk would abide its time, and have occasion, after its\r\nkind, to be grateful because of the tree and its seductive nectar which\r\ntranslated artless little songsters into shrill-tongued roysterers,\r\ncareless of the ills of life, or at least less watchful for the presence\r\nof crafty enemies. Flying foxes would swoop into the tree at sundown to\r\nsqueak and gibber among its repellent branches till dawn, when some, too\r\nfull for flight, would hang among the lower limbs all day, sleeping with\r\neyes veiled by leathery wings.\r\n\r\nFor many a long day the bin-gum tolerated no undergrowth. Despotic over\r\nits territory, the shade was clean but for a carpet of ferns, and its\r\nbranches free from the embraces of orchids, save that which bears the\r\nghostly white flowers which set off its own of bold red. But as it\r\npassed its maturity shrubs and saplings began to encroach, until it was\r\nthe centre of a circus of upstart vegetation, though still stretching\r\nbig, knotty limbs over the slim youths of yesterday. Anterior to this\r\nera a neglected fire had scorched a portion of its trunk. Decay set in.\r\nA huge cavity gradually appeared, betokening vital injuries. The soft\r\nthough tough wood does not patiently endure the annihilating fret of\r\ntime. Far up in a recess of this cavity a toy boomerang was found,\r\nplaced there by some provident but forgetful piccaninny. At the date of\r\nthe discovery of the missile the age of the resident blacks had passed\r\naway; but still the tree stood, stout of limb, while the encompassing\r\nsaplings shot up until sun-seeking shoots caressed the branches and\r\nfamiliarised with the blooms, as if taking credit for the seasonal\r\ngaiety of the patriarch.\r\n\r\nIn the prime of life the wood of the bin-gum is of pale straw colour\r\nwith a faint pinkish tinge, and tough though light. Sapless age makes\r\nit tindery, and the decaying fibre descends in dust--glissades of dust\r\nwhich form moraines within the hollow of the base. Then the end is not\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\nThe old tree might have been credited with premonition of its fate.\r\nHowever fanciful to ascribe to it power of utterance, some phenomena,\r\nperhaps associated with the dusty flux draining its vitals, gave\r\nit distinct voice. On silent days it was often heard--a whispering,\r\nwhimpering sing-song, pitifully weak for so great a tree, but not\r\nwithout appeal. Did it not suggest the sanctuary of some wood-nymph\r\nchanting never so faint a death psalm--a monotone which the idlest\r\nzephyr might still?\r\n\r\nDisdaining to die while consenting to disappear, the great tree, proudly\r\ngreen of head, did not fall headlong, like a giant, in its pride, but\r\nsubsided silently behind its leafy screen while all the winds were\r\nstill, and as one who passes away full of years and with untarnished\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThough the saplings and shrubs which fought for its place decently\r\nconceal its shattered relics, addressing glossy leaves to the face of\r\nthe sun, is it quite vain to expect that its graceful proportions--a\r\ntrue and stately dome--will be transmitted to the most worthy of its\r\ndescendants? Or that they will escape for so long a term the many\r\nmischances that befall soft-wooded trees? No; the bin-gum of the bay was\r\nunique. Afar off its flowers assumed a bricky shade, which contrasted\r\nwith the sage-green background of huge and overtopping melaleucas, while\r\nbut a strip of creamy sand intervened between its low and spreading\r\nbranches and the shallow sea, with its varying tints of pale green and\r\nblue. So lovely and conspicuous a feature is not to be reconstituted\r\nunder a century.\r\n\r\nIf it be permitted to assume that trees are sentient, that each--since\r\nit differs from all others in some material quality and condition--has\r\nits individuality, and that one may stand out from the rest as a\r\nfigure and representative of its age, then was this old monarch which\r\nmaintained its red robes to the last an examplar of the race whose\r\nbirths, nuptials, pastimes, deaths and burials it witnessed from the\r\ndate when the good ship ENDEAVOUR slowly plodded along the alien coast.\r\nThe dust of the witness is blending in common decay. A few months and\r\nnot a trace will be discoverable, and what is left of those who rested\r\nin its shade? In the pages of history they will be unchronicled, for\r\nwere not their lives less beautiful than the life of a tree, and their\r\nrenown no more durable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIET WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Like playhouse scenes the shore slid past.”\r\n\r\n                                     KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nLovable as is the open sea when the spray drenches the scanty clothing\r\nof the steersman and rains upon his lips salty salutation, yet is there\r\nrare delightsomeness in reverse of the wet frolic.\r\n\r\nA few minutes past the deck glistened in the sun as each rollicking\r\nbillow sent its herald over the bows, and here the surface of the river\r\nis almost rippleless. Shallows and uncertainties perplex its union with\r\nthe ocean. Sombre green mangroves screen its muddy banks at full tide\r\nand trail leathery leaves and the tips of spindly fruit on its placid\r\nsurface. Pendant roots and immersed branches create on each hand a\r\ncontinuous scroll of wavering ridges and eddies bordered with the\r\nliving tints of the steadfast wall of leafage. The sun so burnishes the\r\nmidstream ribbon that the boat seems to float on an invisible element.\r\nThough the topmost leaves of the mangroves fail to disclose any movement\r\nin the air, an unceasing and inharmonious hum tells of the sea idly\r\nshouldering the orange-hued sands outside.\r\n\r\nThe original inhabitants of the country knew the stream as Marang.\r\nNone call it so; but half stranded on the bank at the mouth lies a raft\r\ntypical of the past, and of the ease and resource with which those of\r\nthe day are wont to avail themselves of Nature's suggestions in the art\r\nof crossing flooded waters. The name of the river has gone, but not that\r\nof the three buoyant logs lashed together with strips of cane which with\r\nsullen lurch, take the wash of the boat. The boys jerk their heads in\r\nthe direction and murmur “wur-gun,” and speculate on the last user.\r\nThe day is young. For the time being the best the ancient river has to\r\nshow--the quintessence of the season, superb October--shall be ours. The\r\ncloudless sky is richly blue, lighter in shade than the shapely mountain\r\nwhich seems to block the way miles ahead. The sun gives a taste of its\r\nquality, not to fret or discomfort, but merely to add a slightly richer\r\ntint to skin glowing with previous marks of his fervour and favour.\r\n\r\nAll the sounds of the little engine are maliciously exaggerated as the\r\nboat forges ahead. The silent green river has become vociferous with\r\nechoes, which snap and grunt, groan and hiss, in mockery of inevitable\r\nand earnest doings. Out at sea the merry moods of the boat and hasty\r\nand determined throbs of the engine are manifestations of something\r\naccomplished in the overcoming of distance. Here it is all mere idle\r\nfancy, while the echoes jeer. Surely the uncouth imps of the dimly-lit\r\njungles need not proclaim their spite with such exaggerated fuss.\r\n\r\nWith but little effort of imagination the boat becomes stationary on\r\na shining ribbon with strips of dark green on each side, and the banks\r\nglide past with never so gentle undulations. The tide screens most of\r\nthe mud on which the many-rooted trees stand. Some are in full bloom,\r\nthe hawthorn-like flowers breathing perfume as from an orangery\r\nsoliciting the raids of millions of bees. Scents cling to the placid\r\nsurface. It is as a stream of scent, bounded and confined by changeful\r\ntints as the sun toys with the shadows, and curve after curve, reach\r\nafter reach, slip by. Sometimes the chattering boat heads due east.\r\nSouth she knows too, and then she bows her duty to the west, along\r\nreaches which run straight and clean as a canal; and round hairpin bends\r\nshe sweeps with disdainful air, as if conscious of besoiling banks.\r\n\r\nGradually the monopolistic mangroves become more tolerant of the rights\r\nof other vegetation. Tea-trees with white papery bark and pale yellow\r\nflowers dripping with spirity nectar, the sunflower-tree with its masses\r\nof gold, an occasional wattle, and slim palms mirror themselves, and\r\nhere and there compact jungle, with its entanglement of ponderous vines\r\nand smothering creepers, shoulders away the salt-loving plants.\r\nScents may vary as the river's fringe; but only a delicate blend is\r\nrecognised--the breathings of honey-secreting flowers and of sapful\r\nplants free from all uncleanliness. Many trees endure sadly the\r\ndecoration of orchids in full flower, some lovely to look on and\r\ndeliciously scented. The snowy plumes of one species sway gently, as\r\nif offering friendly greeting. A worthy similitude to the lily of the\r\nvalley clings to a decaying limb, and a passing smudge of lustrous brown\r\nis but the reflection from a mass of the commonest of the Dendrobiums\r\nwhich encumbers a long-suffering host. Where forest trees and wattles\r\nguard the bank the water is of a different hue, as if the face of the\r\nriver had absorbed less of the actualities of the sun. The screen\r\nof vegetation is not only higher, but it is varied and impresses its\r\nindividuality. Only during the pelting rains of the wet season may\r\nthis delightful stream be monotonous, for at intervals brief and\r\nnarrow vistas open out on patches of yellowing grass, and beyond lie\r\nforest-clad hills.\r\n\r\nAll save the boat is wonderfully still. The birds are silent, for this\r\nis the first hot day of the season, and they have retired to the patches\r\nof jungle where shade and dimness afford relief from the sunlight\r\nspaces. For many a mile a cormorant, lacking valour to double on its\r\ntracks, has fled before the boat, settling out of sight ever and anon,\r\nonly to be scared further from its nest. A mangrove bittern sitting\r\nhumpbacked on a root and roused from its night thoughts has flown ahead,\r\nfollowing the bends of the stream until it crossed a familiar loop and\r\nso evaded incessant harrying.\r\n\r\nNo murmur of the sea is audible, though the water is as briny as at the\r\nmouth. Mangroves still reinforce the muddy banks at intervals, and big\r\nbarramundi swirl aside to give the boat precedence in the narrow way.\r\nIf in no impetuous haste, one might drift with the tide up and down with\r\nbut little exertion except during periods of flood, which quickly rise\r\nand quickly subside. Drifters become familiar with characteristics of\r\nthe stream unknown to those who hurry up and down in an echo-rousing\r\nmotor-boat. They see crocodiles basking on their sides, as many as\r\nseven on a sunny morning in the cool season, and many curse them in\r\nDe Quincey's phrase as “miscreated gigantic vermin” because the rifle\r\nhappens to be unavailable. Crocodiles have their moods. Sometimes they\r\nare lazy and indifferent and will not be disturbed though the boat may\r\nclink and chatter as it passes, and the then easygoing man disposes\r\nof them. More often the faculties of the crocodile are disappointingly\r\nacute. He is visible for such a fragment of time that the authoritative\r\nman who has promised sport looks foolish and tries to relieve the strain\r\nby the relation of anecdotes in which circumstances have not been all\r\nin favour of the illusive creature. He tells of the slumbering one which\r\nlay on a mud-bank with its jaws distended, weary of the monotony of\r\nthe mangroves, and took but sleepy notice when upbraided for being a\r\nsluggard. And of that other monstrous beast which, with eyelids like\r\nsaucers and a bulk which filled a narrow tributary of the river,\r\nfloundered, splashed, and flurried into deep water, while the awestruck\r\nindividual with the rifle was too astounded to fire a shot. He may tell,\r\ntoo, of another instance of good luck on the part of the crocodile.\r\nHow, drifting down silently with the ebb, the black boy indicated the\r\npresence of game on a slide overhung by a deep verandah of mud; how a\r\nshot was fired and a big log splashed into the water and the little\r\none remained bearing the bullet-wound, the real having been too big and\r\nimpressive for sight.\r\n\r\nThe day is well spent among strange plants. Here is a tall hibiscus with\r\ncoarse leaves, diversely lobed, and great pink, fragile flowers, each\r\nwith a blotch of maroon at the base and each containing a fat and\r\nlumbering bee spangled with maroon-tinted pollen. A trailing eugenia\r\nbears dark red flowers shaped like a mop, and a tiny white lily with\r\npetals and strangely protuberant anthers scents the air as with honey\r\nand almonds.\r\n\r\nThe tide ebbs fast. All the country teems with entertainment, and the\r\nriver, cool in the dusk, and black, reflects the dead mangroves, white\r\nand spectral, on its brink.\r\n\r\nThis breathless night the sea is as tetchy as petrol. Trailing fingers\r\nare terminals which ignite living flames, and the propeller of the\r\nlittle boat creates an avengeful commotion of light which trails far\r\nastern. Blobs of light are cast off from her bows as she rounds the\r\nfamiliar sandspit and glides to her moorings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE LOWING HERD”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your cattle, too--Allah made them; serviceable, dumb creatures;\r\nthey change the grass into milk; they come ranking home at evening\r\ntime.”--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemote from the manners and the sights of the street, here are we secure\r\nagainst most of the pains which come of the contemplation, casual\r\nor intimate, of other folk's sufferings. No hooded ambulance moves\r\njoltlessly, tended by enwrapt bearers, on pathless way; no formal\r\nprocession paces from the house of death to the long last home. Immune\r\nfrom the associations which oft subdue the crowd, as well as from\r\nits too exciting pleasures, and participating only indirectly in its\r\ninevitable sorrows, yet we are occasionally forced to remember that\r\ntroubles do come to all that is flesh, and that keen is the grief\r\nattendant upon enforced separations even among animals which cannot call\r\nreason to their solace. Man cannot claim to be the sole proprietor\r\nof the luxury of woe, and may he not draw edifying lessons from\r\ncontemplating the transient sorrows of his pets and domestic animals?\r\nIs he to confine his schooling on the wholesome theme of the frailty\r\nof flesh solely to his own species? It is not to be denied that animals\r\nlower in the scale than mankind have acute sense of bereavement, though\r\nit is equally certain that in their case the healing influences of time\r\nare more prompt and potent.\r\n\r\nAn illustration may be cited. Two favourite Irish terriers, in violation\r\nof an all-precautionary training, molested a death adder, the emulation\r\nof each inciting the other to recklessness. When the fray was over and\r\nthe wicked little serpent lay squirming in death, both dogs took joyful\r\ncredit on account of the feat. An hour after one began to froth at the\r\nlips, and in another hour he lay dead. His son and companion, as well as\r\nrival in all rat and lizard hunts, softly approached the body, lifting\r\neach foot with almost solemn deliberation. He sniffed, and catching a\r\nwhiff of the scent of death, sat on his haunches, threw back his head,\r\nand in loud and piercing tones lamented the tragedy until from very\r\nhoarseness he could howl no longer. He stood the solitary spectator of\r\nthe burial, and as the soil was patted down tenderly, sniffed the spot,\r\nwhimpered plaintively, and followed with downcast mien. Unable to fathom\r\nthe mystery of death, yet fearful, if not resentful, he wandered about\r\nfor days rebuking the moon, or its dire influence, and hailing passing\r\nsteamers with weak whines. Time soon soothed the mental hurt.\r\n\r\nSince I became a milker and tender of pet cows many instances have been\r\nrevealed of the patience and amiability of these inestimable beasts. The\r\nman who owns the cattle on a thousand hills, who employs stockmen by the\r\ndozen, who sends off hundreds of fat, contented, happy, liberty-loving\r\noxen in droves to end their days in an unknown locality amid the clatter\r\nand swish of machinery and with the fearful scents of blood and decaying\r\noffal defiling the air, has few opportunities of studying the nicer\r\nqualities of his possessions. He may be full of bullock lore and able to\r\nrecite sensational and entertaining stories illustrative of the ways of\r\nthe big mobs which tramp from native hills and downs to the city of the\r\nthousand deaths. He knows, perhaps, something of the individualities of\r\nhis herds, and will tell how fat beasts form friendships, and how\r\nthey pine when separated. Then will he register his personal regrets,\r\ncounting in the measure for fat, for, refusing food, the animals fall\r\naway in condition, so that the sorrows of two fat bullocks due to\r\nparting, enforced by determined men on horseback, cracking whips and\r\nusing violent and threatening language, come home to the owner in terms\r\nof pounds, shillings, and pence.\r\n\r\nHere are few sordid considerations, for does not the full-fed and\r\ncontented herd supply generously milk and cream with no apprehensions\r\nof the butcher? Perhaps on that account the sentiments of the sleek cows\r\nare more tender. At least it has been noticed that when the time comes\r\nfor the flash young bulls to be banished, and they are transported, the\r\nmother's grief is loud-voiced and prolonged. Under stress of departure\r\nand all the novel excitement of a first experience of the motion of the\r\nsea, the fat calf, which has rollicked in all that makes for good temper\r\nand ease and comfort, becomes mute. Tears trickle from big, affrighted\r\neyes, and the head is turned wistfully when terms of comfort are\r\nuttered. He is of the make of man and will not whimper. But the mother,\r\non the discovery of her bereavement, arouses the echoes of the hills\r\nwith her calls.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to the voices of the individuals of your herd, your ears are\r\nalso attuned to the significant tones of each--the low warning hum of\r\nthe mother to her safely hidden new-born, the imperative command to\r\nobedience, the note of inquiry when the wandering offspring is out of\r\nsight, the anxious call when it is absent from her side unaccountably,\r\nthe angry bellow when she thinks injury is being done.\r\n\r\nThe other day a lusty young bull which had been wont to treat me as a\r\nchum, and perhaps as a slightly inferior animal, was reluctantly\r\nparted from. His face displayed his emotions-astonishment, grief,\r\nresignation--and once, and only once, did he permit himself to protest\r\nvocally. But for a week his mother's sorrow has been insistent. Early on\r\nthe morning following, the banishment, she led off the rest of the\r\nherd in Indian file, to search accustomed scenes. At times she\r\nhastened--perhaps she heard in fancy the loved one's voice--but more\r\noften and with rare persistency she shrewdly scrutinised every possible\r\nhiding-place, lowing plaintively and with a coaxing, wistful tone.\r\nFrequently, attended by silent, sympathising companions, she made\r\nfrantic appeals to me, and then there seemed to be a note as of\r\nupbraiding, if not accusation, in her voice. Knowing her feelings, it\r\nwas easy to interpret them, and her doleful mood and loud yet melodious\r\nprotests against the arbitrary usage of man affected the wonted serenity\r\nof the Isle.\r\n\r\nHow many lusty, fat, sleek, good-humoured, straight-backed, frolicsome\r\ncalves had she reared, and when they had come to the age when a\r\nmother's pride must be in the full, each in its turn had mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. Was this not a subject of moan? Why should she not tell\r\nher grief to the responsive hills, and send it as far as her voice might\r\ncarry over the irresponsive sea?\r\n\r\nTime soothes all such pangs. She calls now when she spies me in the\r\nforest, still suspecting where responsibility rests, and mumbles as she\r\ncrops the succulent herbage. A few more days and her sturdy offspring\r\nwill be forgotten; but the recollection of her material woes excites the\r\nthought that human beings, in guiding the destinies of domestic animals,\r\nmay not always be conscious of certain moral aspects of such incidents.\r\nAre we justified in lacerating the feelings of those creatures, which\r\nhave become accustomed to our ways, which submit to our arbitrary\r\nauthority with wondrous patience, which depend on us in many ways, and\r\nwhich trust us with unquestioning fidelity?\r\n\r\nAgainst all precedent, the dairy herd was started with a bull. Though\r\nsuch a beginning is not to be recommended as a general precept, it must\r\nbe confessed that in this particular instance developments proved its\r\nwisdom. Unjust fears were overcome while yet he was undistracted by\r\nsociety of his kind. Having no other company, he sought ours in frank\r\nand friendly manner. Occasionally he would accompany me on indefinite\r\nexcursions in the bush, and would oft tempt me to play. With the fable\r\nof the frogs and the boys in mind, I had to decline participation in his\r\nsportful moods, for what would have proved pure frolic to him might have\r\nbeen fraught with disaster to me. At this period of the dairy herd,\r\nhe spent most of his leisure moments in the paddock where poultry\r\ncongregates, and where many of the domestic rites are performed. He\r\nwas at home, and he was a gentleman, and did no one premeditated ill.\r\nLonging for something to play with, he would make hostile demonstration\r\nagainst the wheelbarrow, but that dull-hearted vehicle never responded\r\nexcept by ignominious collapse at tenderest touch of horn. One evening,\r\nwhen all the good little chicks had been put to bed for the night, the\r\nbull, impatient for play, overturned two coops so suddenly that two of\r\nthe inmates were crushed flat. There was no sheltering mother to protest\r\nagainst such violation, and so the adjoining coop was visited. But for\r\nonce he went wrong in strategy. The coop contained an exceptionally\r\nnumerous family, the mother of which richly deserved the name of\r\n“Scotty.” The coop was overturned none too politely; the squeaking\r\nchicks vanished in the grass and remained discreetly silent; the irate\r\nhen, with the valour of ignorance and all feathers on end, flew in the\r\nface of the startled bull. Though a white leghorn, she has fighting\r\nblood in her veins, and as she hurled herself--stuttering with\r\nfrantic exclamations--at the violator of her home, he backed with a\r\nmirth-provoking look of surprise and dismay. He seemed to wish to say\r\nthat he regretted the intrusion, and would apologise and ask permission\r\nto retire. The hen was not in the mood to accept apologies, however\r\nseemly the cringing attitude of the bull. Making herself ever so much\r\nbigger than Nature intended, she followed up her advantages, slapping\r\nher enemy's face with widespread wings until he winced again, and\r\nclawing with truly feminine extravagance and uncertainty of aim. The\r\nfirst round was all to the credit of the hen, and the startled poultry\r\ncackled derisively as the bull retreated. Sure of victory, the hen\r\nfollowed him up, skipping, flapping, clawing, and scolding as only an\r\nirate hen in transports of rage can. Still the bull backed. He was a\r\ngentleman, and genuinely afraid of female tantrums. With half-shut eyes,\r\nhe submitted to the buffets of the wings, while encouraging remarks\r\nfrom friends and companions further excited the delirious pugnacity\r\nof “Scotty.” Then it seemed to dawn on him that honour was at stake.\r\nGallantry forbade him to do violence to a lady; honour forbade him to\r\nrun away. What other recourse was open? He must treat the whole episode\r\nas a joke. So, rubbing his muzzle on the ground, he invited the hen to\r\ncome on. She did so. There was a splash of outspread feathers against\r\nhis front and more clatter than ever. He pawed the ground, jerking\r\nlittle clods over his shoulders, and, lowering his head, menaced the\r\nhen with horns that could have tossed her over the highest of the\r\nmango-trees. But there was a smile on his face the while, and the\r\nspectators knew, though “Scotty” did not, that it was all a joke. Again\r\nand again she flew in his face. Just as often he refused to take her\r\nseriously, though all the pantomime of battle was displayed. She cackled\r\nin impotent anger. He bellowed with gratification. Not a fowl in the\r\nyard saw the joke, and all the little chicks in adjacent coops strained\r\ntheir necks to watch the battle and their voices in shrill comments.\r\nHaving made not the slightest impression on the jovial little bull,\r\n“Scotty” retired, feinting and scolding, while he, still blue mouldy\r\nfor a game, coaxed her by unmistakable gesticulation to one round\r\nmore. Twice during the night “Scotty” dispelled the silences with loud\r\nexclamations of wrath and defiance. She was fighting her battle again in\r\nher dreams, and though I was not there to see, I am very sure that the\r\ngentle bull beguiled his wakeful moments with smiles. There are several\r\nwhite hens in the yard, and whensoever one crosses his path the\r\nbull, who does not pretend to discriminate, tosses his head with an\r\ninterrogative gesture. “Do you want to fight?” he says, and the hens\r\nflee--all except “Scotty.”\r\n\r\nThe herd comprises a dainty little cow of most placid disposition.\r\nNothing disturbs her placidity, incites her to hurry, or bewilders her.\r\nCure the dove of its timidity and shrinking and you will have a good\r\nprototype of Parilla, who, taking life easily and affably, is fat and\r\namiable. When she brought home her firstborn, mooing plaintively, he,\r\nbig and fat for his age, walked into the byre as a matter of course.\r\nHere was the first evidence of heredity. It was patent that Fillo\r\nBillaroo was born with a mind like that of his sweet-tempered mother.\r\nHe earned his name because of acute dissimilarity to the swiftlet which\r\nswoops about the cleared spaces, never resting save in a dark and dirty\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nThough, apparently, entirely unselfconscious, Fillo Billaroo at once\r\nestablished himself as a superior sort of creature. He did not exact any\r\nrights. They were conceded with all possible grace. He enjoys privileges\r\nnone other dares to imagine. When he has exhausted for the time being\r\nthe maternal source of refreshment, he visits other mothers, and with\r\nsuch a pompous, patronising, good-humoured, thoroughly appreciative and\r\nyet gentle way, that the absurd creatures are flattered. They realise he\r\nis something quite out of the common, and give agreeably of their best.\r\nThus he has become a favourite, and he drinks so much and has become so\r\nfat that he could not for a couple of weeks accompany his lazy-pacing\r\nmother on her daily rounds, but would be planted in shade and coolness\r\nwith cautions against straying until called for late in the afternoon.\r\nOften would Parilla forget the hiding-place, or rather pretend to,\r\nand beseech in wistful tones for help in the search, and when it was\r\nsuccessful the greetings she bestowed displayed the bigness of her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nOnce the little mother left Fillo Billaroo in charge of Lady Clare,\r\na much more experienced matron, who cannot bear to permit her frisky\r\nheifer out of her sight for a moment unless safely planted, and then the\r\ntreasure must not be wandered from more than a hundred yards. Parilla\r\nwent off for the day. Late in the afternoon, Lady Clare with her heifer\r\nand Fillo Billaroo were found far away from the mob and driven home. It\r\nhad been hot, and the big calf has an enormous appetite and apparently\r\nLady Clare had been coy. When he saw his mother and his mother saw him,\r\nhe stooped with uplifting nose, sniffing; she stopped feeding and begin\r\nto sniff. He seemed to say to himself, “I do believe I know that little\r\ncreature. Yes; I am certain I must have met her before. She rather\r\nresembles my own mother; but I have so many fond, kind, and obliging\r\naunts that it is not so very easy to make sure. She has a special look.\r\nCan I be mistaken? I really hope not, for I am painfully hungry.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Parilla was saying to herself--you could see it all\r\nplainly written in her big, round, bulging eyes, so full of inquiry,\r\nhope and longing--! “The sight of that really fine fellow reminds me\r\nthat I, too, am a mother. He is a pretty fellow; I fancy that Fillo\r\nBillaroo is not unlike him. I now recollect with dismay that I have not\r\nseen him since morning, when Lady Clare condescended to look after him.\r\nAnd there's Lady Clare! Oh! if she's mislaid Fillo Billaroo! But can\r\nthat fine, beautiful fellow be mine? I must inquire. Come!” And she\r\nmoo'd, and Fillo Billaroo murmured “Mum,” and they rushed to one\r\nanother, and the look in Parilla's face was that of perfect happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABBLING BEACHES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“By the wisdom of Nature it has been appointed that more pleasure may be\r\ntaken in small things than in great.”--Ruskin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a breezy day, when the sun scorches the sand and the wind\r\ncontinuously sweeps off the dry surface, and your ears detect the\r\nmusical sound accompanying the process--vague as the visible part of it\r\nis blurred and misty--then it is that you are made aware of the agencies\r\nby which time creates geographical differences. Precipitated at the apex\r\nof the spit, the sand as it sinks tints the verge of the sea, while\r\nthe lighter spoil, leaves and wisps of seaweed, trip off on independent\r\nvoyage. The current from the south pares the spit, preserving its\r\nshapeliness. The ebb from the bay maintains the fluent inner curve.\r\nThe dry wind, the current with its northerly set, and the ebb in\r\nconjunction, push the spit to the north, and as the sand advances,\r\nvegetation consolidates the work. Then comes the season of northerly\r\nwinds, when the apex of the spit is forced backwards and outwards into\r\na brief but graceful flourish, in the bight of which small boats may\r\nnestle, though the seas roar and show white teeth a few yards away.\r\nSince the winds of the north are less in duration and persistency than\r\nthose from the south and east, the tendency of the spit--in defiance\r\nof the yearly setback--is to the north. Driftwood, logs, and huge trees\r\nwith bare, branchless limbs become stranded, to dry and whiten in the\r\nsun and reinforce the sand, and in their decay, with ever contributed\r\nseaweed, to make mould for vegetation. The work of encroachment and\r\nconsolidation is incessant and strangely rapid, for vegetation never\r\nlacks pioneers of special character to prepare the way for the less\r\nventuresome and less hardy. Often before vegetation appears, coral\r\nchips, shells, small stones, and sharp gravel, are concreted into\r\nplatter-shaped masses which seem to become the base of blocks of rough\r\nconglomerate, capable of resisting the attacks of the sea; and a few\r\nyards back, where a mangrove-bordered creek once existed, the mud and\r\ndecayed fragments of wood have been transformed into a black, cheesy\r\nsubstance which might be mistaken for soft coal. So do these beaches lay\r\nbare their secrets.\r\n\r\nWhen the mainland streams pour out their floods and the commingled\r\nvolume hurries north in a mud-tinted, sharply delimited current, and\r\nwhole trees are cast up on the beaches of far-away isles, vivid examples\r\nof the dispersion of animate and inanimate things by purely natural\r\nmeans are afforded. Weighty stones are found locked among roots which,\r\nas the wood decays, are deposited on alien sands, thereafter to invite\r\nspeculation as to origin and means of transport. On one such raft\r\nvoyaged a living specimen of the white and black banded snake, one of\r\nthe most singular of the family, for Nature has bestowed on it a placid\r\ndisposition, and provided it with an unmischievous mouth and fangs\r\nso minute that, although classed as venomous, it is not considered\r\ninjurious to man. Though strange and interesting, on the plea that the\r\nfamily is quite sufficiently represented, the derelict was unwelcome,\r\nsave as a living proof of the practicability of natural transports.\r\nBy what grace, indeed, could the creature which earned the Almighty's\r\nbitter curse be accepted as “wilsam”--goods of God's mercy driven\r\nashore, no wreck or ship being visible?\r\n\r\nThis small bay never ceases the laying of tribute at one's feet. There\r\nare seasons when the amount is less than at others; but how seldom\r\nare its sands trodden without a display of the infinite variety of\r\nproductions of the ocean? When the mood of the sea is savage and the\r\nspoil from the reef is flung in ridges among the vegetation of the\r\nshore--coral in blocks and shattered masses, shells, seaweed, sponges,\r\nand other dead marine animals and driftwood, heap on heap--days of\r\nenthusiastic toil might be spent in sorting out the oversurplus of the\r\nsecrets of the sea. But for months together the beach maintains its\r\ncleanly orderliness, and during these dreamy days the sea will tell of\r\nmany a pretty treasure which the sands will reveal in the face of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of botanists compiled a floral almanac; the months,\r\nand in some cases the weeks, being associated with the development and\r\nflowering of significant plants. So might it be possible to ascribe to\r\nparticular months the tokens with which the obliging sea bestrews the\r\nbeaches. It is not proposed herein to attempt any such design, which\r\nwould involve special knowledge of the science of conchology and the\r\ncompilation of the records of years of patient observation. A few\r\nexamples of the material on which the delightful work might be\r\nundertaken are given, so that the wealth of one brief strip of beach may\r\nbe taken as typical of a vast stretch of calm waters within the Great\r\nBarrier Reef.\r\n\r\nThe ridges and furrows of the cyclone season, when the clean sand is\r\ncovered and stained with weed, dead and living molluscs, coral, leaves\r\ncarried from the hills by flooded streams, all fermenting in the heat,\r\ntell that Christmas is past and March not yet over. Many a year passes\r\nwithout such a storm as compels the groaning ocean to ravage its reefs.\r\nThen the beaches, during the first three months are not particularly\r\nfertile, nor are the shells to be found special or peculiar. In April\r\nmany specimens of the mollusc known as Tapes, of which there are several\r\nspecies, are cast ashore, empty but fresh. In life the animal buries\r\nitself in the mud at the edge of the sand, and some disturbance of\r\nnatural conditions, possibly due to the fresh water from flooded rivers,\r\ncauses seasonal mortality. The most conspicuous of the species is that\r\nknown as “literati,” because of the erratic scribblings decorating its\r\nvalves. With others of the genera, it is to be found cast away at other\r\ntimes of the year, but the end of the wet season seems exceptionally\r\ndireful.\r\n\r\nApril is confirmed, too, but transiently, by the presence of a frail\r\nmollusc (HAMINAEA CYMBALUM) which is washed ashore attached to seaweed,\r\nsoon to disappear desiccated by the sun and ground to powder. The shell\r\nis semi-transparent with a sandy tint, and in form not unlike that of\r\na common snail. As the weather becomes cooler, a thin, delicate bivalve\r\ndecorates high-water mark. It is one of the tellinas--semi-transparent,\r\nlustrous, and fragile--which occurs in muddy sand, but why the species\r\nshould be more susceptible to the ills of life during a particular\r\nseason is not apparent. When the fates do conspire against its welfare\r\ndozen of bright specimens may be picked up during a casual stroll, the\r\nanimal having disappeared. The epidemic the beach thus announced\r\nwith pink and glittering shells coincides with low night tides, which\r\npossibly leave the inefficiently protected animals exposed to the\r\nattacks of uncustomary enemies which thrive only when the muddy banks\r\nare exposed. The cause of the exhibition of the relics is not of so much\r\nconcern to the unlearned observer as the relics themselves and the part\r\nthey play in signifying the progress of the season. If strong winds\r\noccur during the cool months, among the wreaths of broken seaweed thrown\r\non the beach may be found unbroken and fresh specimens of a singularly\r\nbeautiful and fragile univalve known commonly and most appropriately as\r\nthe “bubble shell” (HYDATINA PHYSIS), which when alive is a most lovely\r\nobject, its fine spiral lines being black and faint yellow with faint\r\npurple edges, while the mantle is fringed with light blue intermingled\r\nwith pale yellow. In some specimens the base colouring is fawn, the\r\nlines, of varying width, being brown and “comely crinkled,” like the\r\nface of the pleasant old woman of whom a poet wrote. Such a frail shell\r\nis subject to many mischances before it reaches the beach, and a few\r\nhours of exposure to the sun tarnishes its lustre. To obtain it in\r\nperfection the beach must be patrolled every day during due season,\r\nand very rarely is the collector rewarded by the discovery of unsullied\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nWhen the chill is out of the surface the spring-time of the sea begins.\r\nVegetable life is strenuous, so that one may chance to see a lazy turtle\r\nbearing on its back a weedy garden. The water is alive. Miles of space\r\nare belted with that plant to which Captain Cook applied a significant\r\nname, likening it in its myriads to “sea sawdust.” Some dare call it\r\n“whale spawn,” forgetful that the whale is not a fish. Others assert it\r\nto be none other than the “coral insect,” which does not exist save in\r\nthe minds of those who write odes to such creatures:\r\n\r\n    “Ye build, ye build, but ye enter not in,\r\n    Like the tribes whom the desert devoured in their sin.”\r\n\r\nIt consists of minute vegetation in bundles, to be individualised under\r\na strong microscope, though when countless billions drift on to the\r\nbeaches and die and become green and grey with corruption, the fumes are\r\nby no means in proportion to the marvellous littleness of the individual\r\nplants. Then we know by the organs of scent and sight that August has\r\ncome. The beaches are foul. The breakers roll in unbroken or with a\r\nmuddy, froth, for the scum acts as oil, calming even troubled water.\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea is said by some authorities to derive its title from the\r\nscum formed by this plant (TRICHODESMIUM ERYTHRAEUM), which is strongly\r\nimpregnated with iodine. It emits a most disagreeable odour and exhales\r\na gas which affects the mucous membrane, causing in some individuals\r\nsneezing and inflammation of the eyes. One amateur fisherman of\r\nconsiderable experience and by no means susceptible to intangible\r\nirritations, and not to be diverted from his sport by trifles, has\r\nfrequently been compelled to move from a favourite ground by a stream of\r\nthe scum drifting to his anchored boat. The fumes gave intense smartness\r\nto the eyes, which were relieved by a gush of tears, but keen discomfort\r\nrecurred when the tears were wiped away.\r\n\r\nFollowing the least desirable of marine phenomena is that which is known\r\nas the “blanket weed,” which floats ashore in loathsome blobs, a hand's\r\nbreadth and more, the centre a grey, solidified slime, with a periphery\r\nof long, dull green, slimy, shapeless fringes Individual plants coalesce\r\non the sand and, mingling with other weeds, cover respectable beaches\r\nwith a woolly, compact mass not unlike a rough, thick blanket, but\r\nteeming with unpleasantnesses. Isolated plants cling to ropes, which\r\nbecome garlanded with thickened slime, from which evil-smelling mud\r\noozes. Offensive to man afloat and ashore, the “blanket weed” is a\r\nluxury to mullet and garfish, for during its period both may be seen\r\nin shoals skimming the surface of the sea in abandonment of habitual\r\nshyness, and the stomachs of both are found to be full of the\r\ngreenish-grey slime. With the compliance of the sun the impurity\r\ndisappears, giving place to the graceful weed of vivid green that\r\nattaches itself to dead and whitened shells and fingers of coral covered\r\nat low water. Every flood-tide deposits a zone of shells splashed\r\nwith green, while the shallows glow as a field of rich pasturage. In\r\nfavourable situations, such as the upper part of a long immersed log,\r\ncoated to the water-line with goose barnacles, the plant grows long and\r\nluxuriantly, falling on each side like a silken mantle.\r\n\r\nOne other season, ephemeral but universal, do the babbling but\r\ntruth-telling beaches record. No rocky cove, no smooth strand, no\r\nrubbish-accumulating creek, no mangrove-fringed islet, no coral\r\nesplanade white under the tropic sun, no sand-bank with crest of\r\nwindshaken bush, is free. It is Christmas. Christian and pagan alike\r\ntell it to the sea, and the sea tells it to the beaches in--corks.\r\n\r\nThough there are grounds for the belief that some molluscs are seasonal\r\nin their appearances and disappearances, the majority are always with\r\nus, though subject to many casualties. A few months since an epidemic\r\nbroke out among a certain species of sea urchins (Echinus), spherical\r\nanimals with shells thickly set with spines, keen and exceedingly\r\nbrittle. The beaches were strewn with thousands of the dead, no apparent\r\nexterior injury having been suffered. The particular species afflicted\r\ngathers to itself, seemingly as a disguise, but perhaps as ballast, the\r\ndead shells of cockles, which are retained by the spines. It was noticed\r\nthat the dead were not encumbered.\r\n\r\nA curious and one of the rarest of local shells is that known as the\r\nelephant's tusk (DENTALIUM APTINUM). Pure white and slightly fluted\r\nlongitudinally, it typifies the marvellous extent of Nature's\r\nrequirements and her fertility in design. It is especially interesting\r\nto note that the existence of the species in Australian waters has not\r\nhitherto been recorded, the nearest known locality being the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe DRUPA RICINUS (so specifically called because of resemblance to\r\nthe prickly seeds of the castor-oil plant) has another feature almost\r\nunique--two ivory-white projections in the mouth, singularly like a\r\nbaby's teeth. In the waters of Florida is a distinct curiosity in the\r\nform of an altogether different mollusc which is commonly known as the\r\n“bleeding-tooth shell,” the gory stains about the base of the tooth\r\nbeing highly significant. The local example of the whimsicality of\r\nNature owes its excellence to absolute purity. No fond mother crooning\r\nto her first-born ever looked on budding teeth more delightful in\r\nmodelling and pearliness.\r\n\r\nCHAMA LAXARUS belongs to the same family as the clams, the largest of\r\nliving molluscs, its specific title being an allusion to the tattered\r\nraiment of the beggar of the most edifying of parables. Occasionally the\r\nchina-white upper valve is decorated with a broad streak of buff. Some\r\nof the genera are attached to coral or rock indifferently by\r\neither valve, and it is exceptional to find on the beach a perfect\r\nspecimen--that is, the valves united. Since on the reef the shells are\r\nfrequently protectively disguised with seaweed and other growth, it is\r\nonly after the violence of a cyclone that the amateur collector expects\r\nto be rewarded.\r\n\r\nUnlike some others of the family, the cockscomb oyster, though not\r\nobjecting to the near-by presence of its kind, seems to hate a crowd.\r\nHalf a dozen may occupy separate areas on a rock, and solitary specimens\r\nlie embedded and strongly anchored in the sand. A typical example may\r\nweigh over seven pounds. So big and weighty a shell can scarcely\r\nbe sensible of its invariable burden of parasites and other\r\nencumbrances--but the variety of such tenants never fails to excite\r\ncuriosity. That which is illustrated accommodated another oyster of\r\ndelicate texture, a thorny clam (which has the reputation of being\r\npoisonous), a mass of seaweed, a serpentine mollusc, two species of\r\ncoral--the red organ-pipe and a mushroom--three burrowing crabs, besides\r\na number of smaller animals, fixed and mobile, in addition to the\r\ncongregation of less obvious life critical examination would undoubtedly\r\nhave revealed.\r\n\r\nMost species of univalves are wanderers, many bivalves are free,\r\nand multivalves become fixed at an early stage of existence. The\r\ngoose-necked barnacle, with its five valves, comes in its myriads\r\nattached to derelict coco-nuts, floating logs, and pumice-stone. The\r\nspecies owes its name to the fabulous belief that it was the preliminary\r\nstate of the barnacle goose of the Arctic regions, the filaments\r\nrepresenting the plumage and the valves the wings. It has been found on\r\nshells, whales, turtles, and marine snakes.\r\n\r\nIn the mud close to the edge of the beach sand one of the most singular\r\nof marine animals exists, and often its empty, horny, flexible,\r\nsemi-transparent shell, always tinted green, may be found. It is known\r\nin some works as LINGULA ANATINA, and by the natives of this Isle, by\r\nwhom a certain part of it is eaten, as “Mill-ar-ing.” A pinhole in the\r\nmud indicates the presence of the animal, and the hungry black boy,\r\nthrusting his hand with outspread fingers below it, closes the fingers\r\nand withdraws anything but an inviting morsel. To the tongue-shaped\r\nshell is attached a pedicle or stalk, attaining a length of ten inches,\r\nopaque and tough, which is broken off, seared over the fire, and eaten\r\nwith apparent relish. It is remarkable that in localities in which this\r\nmollusc is found a seaweed occurs similar in shape and size, the chief\r\ndifference in appearance being in the length of the stalk, which in the\r\nplant is thin and membranous.\r\n\r\nThe Phorous, or carrier, otherwise the mineralogist, is remarkable for\r\nits extraordinary habit of cementing to its exterior stones of irregular\r\nsize, and in some cases dead shells of other species, an office\r\nperformed by the use of an exceptionally long tongue. Its movements are\r\nsaid to be very clumsy and erratic, as if its self-imposed burden was\r\ntoo cumbersome for its strength. Personal observation fails to verify\r\nits staggering gait, for dead specimens only have been found. The\r\nstones are, no doubt, designedly acquired as a disguise and so represent\r\nanother form of life insurance. When stationary the mineralogist\r\nsuccessfully baffles observation; but some day, peradventure, in a\r\nmoment of preoccupation, it will reveal itself lurching along over the\r\nrough country it favours. How few living things escape the “penalties of\r\nAdam.” Some bear sorrows, some stones.\r\n\r\nAmong the fixed molluscs are what is known as the winged shells, to\r\nwhich the “pearl oysters” belong. The name is apt, for the expanded\r\nvalves are not unlike the form of a bird in flight. The illustration\r\nshows a rare species, several specimens of which were found attached to\r\nthe mooring-chain of a buoy by what is known as the “byssus,” a bunch\r\nof tough fibres which passes through an hiatus in the margins of the\r\nvalves. Like the king's daughter of the Psalmist, PTERIA PEASEI is “all\r\nglorious within,” the nacreous surface, margined with lustrous black,\r\nshining like silver with a tinge of blue.\r\n\r\nOnly a very small proportion of the species of shells to be found on the\r\nshore of this bay have been enumerated. In a work of general character a\r\ncomplete commentary on any particular branch of natural science would\r\nbe out of place, nor is it competent for one who has but a trifling\r\nknowledge of a special subject to deal with it in an enlightening\r\nmanner. It would be highly interesting to ascertain by study and\r\nobservation why the denizens of so many parts of the ocean meet in\r\ncommunity in such a narrow space, though it may not be very difficult to\r\npresent a fairly satisfactory theory for the continuous presence of\r\nmany species by reference to existing features and prevalent conditions.\r\nWithin the area of the bay the water varies in depth from a few feet to\r\nfour fathoms, the rise and fall of the tide being about two fathoms. The\r\nfringing coral reef represents all stages of development and decay--live\r\ngrowth on the outer edge, ever encroaching on the deeper water, and\r\ncomprising many varieties; dying masses on the shore-side, and a\r\nconsiderable extent of dead and denuded relics lying in mud. There are\r\nalso weedy patches, bare sand-banks of limited extent, uncovered at low\r\nwater, and muddy depressions both in the deep and shallow portions and\r\nclean sand. Strong currents race past the sand-spit and across the bay,\r\ncarrying, no doubt, continual supplies of spat from elsewhere to settle\r\nin quiet places. No one who has lived on the margin of the tropic sea\r\ncan be astounded at its prolific life, though it may be a matter of\r\nunceasing wonder that along a beach not more than four hundred yards\r\nin extent should be found shells representative of species existing in\r\nnearly all the warm waters of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other isles with other beaches. One may present a narrow\r\nstrip of soft sand, cringing and squeaking under foot, almost entirely\r\ncomposed of finely ground coral and shells, among which polished\r\nfragments of red coral are to the beach-comber as the “colours” the gold\r\nfossicker may find in his dish--prospective of reward. They reinspire\r\nthe like fervour which leads to the discovery of mountains as well as\r\nmicrobes, for may they not signify the existence within the bounds of\r\nthe Great Barrier Reef of the precious coral of the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Red Sea? Above such hopeful sands lies a band formed of stag's-horn\r\ncoral, bleached snow-white, each time lying at right angles to the sea,\r\nand higher up on the strand are blocks and lumps of weather-stained\r\ncoral among which vegetation is springing. A few yards further back\r\nstands a group of Pandanus palms, the van of the dense and intricate\r\njungle covering rock and ridge.\r\n\r\nThe shore of the sister islet may at the moment be but series of steeply\r\nshelving banks of coral debris, to the base of the granite ramparts over\r\nwhich the luxuriant foliage falls.\r\n\r\nEach islet has its distinguishing features, each beach its budget of\r\nnews for ears attuned to “small measures,” each its display of seemly\r\nthings--the sweepings of the floor of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST ISLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Some unsuspected Isle in far-off seas.”\r\n\r\n                               BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a region of rare serenity it lay--a blue stud on a silver\r\nshield--aloof from other lands--unmapped, untarnished, pure, gleaming in\r\nthe dawn of exultant day.\r\n\r\nEmblem of perfection, its charms were imperative, partly because of\r\nremoteness from the taint of man-trodden land, mainly because, by right\r\nof discovery, it was joyfully mine. Could anything be more desirable\r\nthan such a blending of jungle-clad mountains, verdurous hills,\r\nsheltered valleys, orange-tinted beaches, with the shadows of white\r\nheadlands staining the sea purple?\r\n\r\nAn all-comprehending glance revealed the Isle in the shape of a\r\nfive-rayed star, each ray irregularly serrated. Here was promise of many\r\na landlocked cove to which the breathings of the sea would be foreign.\r\nUnsalted streams wound among the foothills of the central mountain,\r\nwhence a spire of rose-red porphyry shot into the luminous sky from\r\nunbroken jungle, the superficies of which were soft and brilliant as\r\nsodden moss.\r\n\r\nSome of the valleys showed in succession ever-green, flower-bedecked\r\nglades, with great trees and blossoming shrubs in scattered clumps and\r\npatches, among which sinuous ribbons of jungle denoted the courses of\r\ndeep hidden streams. Others were merely precipitous depressions in the\r\nunbroken mass of foliage, variegated with aspiring palms so slender of\r\nshaft that their unceasing swaying in the still air seemed an act of\r\nunconscious affectation for the display of huge bunches of gaudy fruit,\r\nseductive and dulcet to the taste. Spider-webbed tree-ferns with\r\nfurry, water-bespangled trunks stood in crowded groves on the brink of\r\nspray-creating cascades and along the margins of cool rivulets which\r\nmurmured as they hurried to the sea.\r\n\r\nWater-dripping moss padded the lintels of grottos, before which dangled\r\ntranslucent ferns of delicate form, yet so rich and intense with\r\nlife that crozier-tipped fronds took the hue of flowers--coral-red,\r\ngolden-bronze, and yellow; while golden dust clung to hairy undersides\r\nlike pollen to the thighs of hive-returning bees. Deep in perpetual\r\nshadow lived a shy plant with heart-shaped leaves, so succulent and\r\ndistended as to resemble green capsules, and in association with each\r\nleaf was a single semi-transparent fruit, pink with a central glow\r\nlike the fire of opal, but so frail that upon touch it resolved into a\r\ndewdrop which glistened, trembled, and was gone in a moment.\r\n\r\nIn the full blaze, feather-foliaged trees crowned with gigantic red\r\nblossoms offered as a sacrifice fruit which blushed before the insistent\r\ngaze of the sun; while beneath this gay canopy vine and creeper and\r\npliant shrub wove an undergarment which screened the moist earth and\r\ncreated a realm of subdued light in which all the flowers were pale of\r\ntint and tremulously fragile, though of almost forbidding magnitude of\r\nform.\r\n\r\nBirds of painted plumage and loud and sonorous note sang and fluttered\r\namong the flowers and fruit with no ill thing to disturb them, no\r\ndissonance to compel them to silence and fear.\r\n\r\nWhithersoever I gazed, the lone and lovely Isle denoted a paradise of\r\nunkempt vegetation, unfeared birds. No stump was there to betray\r\nthe passing of the devastating axe. No footprint except that of\r\nbirds--erratic, rectangular, scribbling--dented the sand. No human being\r\nhad ever visited those groves perfumed by orchids, gauzy as the wings of\r\nthe butterflies which poised over them and sipped the nectar stored in\r\ntheir slender throats.\r\n\r\nEach bay and inlet and cove differed in delightsomeness. Unsoiled,\r\nweedless sand littered with shells floored this deep and sheltered nook,\r\nwhere shadow and substance blended to the complete deceit of the closest\r\nscrutiny. The next was as a garden of shrubs with living blossoms and\r\nfruit in strange shapes and gaudy colours. Many of the subaqueous plants\r\nexpanded and retracted their blossoms harmoniously, as if to the strains\r\nof music audible only to the mute denizens of the sea--a measured,\r\nwaving dance, fantastic and wondrously beautiful. Crystalline clearness\r\nmagnified the detail of the next, the portals of which were coral, dyed\r\nextravagantly and variously according to the secret of the sea, with its\r\ninexhaustible chemicals. Fish in unimaginable shapes, fantastic hues,\r\nand sea-things harmless and educative to the sight, roamed the coral\r\ngardens, retiring at will into sapphire-blue caverns or flashing in\r\nthe clearness with lightning speed and scarce visible effort. Cream\r\nand yellow, old gold, blue, pink and lavender, the corals flourished in\r\nmyriad shapes. Anemones, large as plates, royal blue and greyish-green,\r\nand each bristling with thousands of independent activities, embossed\r\nsnow-white blocks.\r\n\r\nOpening out into an oval basin, the inlet was again constricted, the\r\nbottle-neck entrance to a perfect haven being guarded by huge masses of\r\nlimestone, weathered grotesquely, from the crevices of which sprays\r\nof peach-coloured orchids quivered, while the flora of land and sea\r\ncommingled on the lustrous surface. Beyond again, the inlet wound round\r\nthe base of it cliff vocal with the fugue of birds which flew from\r\nflowery parapet to flowery parapet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually the cliffs retreated, leaving fair banks with shrubs and great\r\ntrees with branches pendulous over unbroken placidity, and there, on\r\na knoll, stood a palm, rigid and straight as a column, crowned with\r\nshimmering fronds which shielded masses of nuts, brown and green,\r\nand great sprays of straw-coloured infloresence. More palms beyond,\r\nthick-set; and beyond again an avenue in perfect alignment, each tree\r\nperfect in stately form, with one blotch of glorious purple--as high and\r\ncompact as a church--to block the diminished distance.\r\n\r\nThe boat drifted to the landing never touched by foot of man. Lost in\r\nadmiration of the imposing and manifold perfections of the Isle, eager\r\nto wander at will among those enticing glades, and to make festival with\r\ntheir genial gods, I stepped out--and into nothingness!\r\n\r\nCan it be that never again shall be discovered in the Land of Dreams the\r\nLost Isle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--THE PASSING FACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORROBOREE\r\n\r\n\r\n“No ceremony that to great ones 'longs.”\r\n\r\n                            SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummoned, invited, children, men, women, and piccaninnies assembled to\r\nparticipate in the duties and recreations of the moment.\r\n\r\nMessage-sticks had been carried into unfamiliar country by nervous boys.\r\nOne of the organisers at ease with his pen sent to his kin formal and\r\nofficial invitations mingled with social and affectionate greetings. All\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nThe beach sent its silent-footed contingents trailing along the yellow\r\nsands, carrying in well-worn dilly-bags oysters and scraps of half-baked\r\nfish smeared with smoke, and gritty. All their lives had they trudged\r\nalong the convenient margin of the sea, where the receding tide leaves\r\na firm, level, springy track. They were familiar with all its moods, and\r\ntook little heed of any.\r\n\r\nThe fame of a previous Parliament had spread far and wide, even to that\r\naspect of the Dividing Range which sends its waters to the great shallow\r\ngulf to the west. Natives who, though living among the mountains but two\r\ndays' journey from the coast, had never seen the sea, hastened thither\r\nin bee-line, passing through unknown but not unfriendly country. Though\r\nthe age of tribal feuds was past, special weapons of defence were\r\ncarried, for did not strange jungles teem with spectral denizens whom\r\nimagination endowed with appalling shape, with cunning, and with rending\r\nferocity? Unmolested, the party arrived one evening, to gaze with\r\nmute astonishment on the sea. It was almost as incomprehensible, and\r\ntherefore almost as fearsome, as the phantoms of the bush. Mysterious,\r\nvast beyond the range of vision, here grumbling on the sand, there\r\nmingling with the sky, the strangers peered at it through the screen\r\nof whimpering casuarinas and trembled. The rustle of the subsiding\r\nnorth-easter made for fear. They told one another that the big salt\r\nwater was alive. It talked in austere tones, while their own sleepy\r\nlagoons were silent and tame. Wonderingly, they retreated to the jungle\r\nfor the night, there to take counsel of the long-shoremen.\r\n\r\n“That b-i-g fella salt water, him talk all asame?”\r\n\r\n“Yowi! Him sing out plenty. Mak'm b-i-g fella row!”\r\n\r\n“That fella him walk about lika that?”\r\n\r\n“Yowi! Him walk about. Quiet little bit. Sometime run about splash'm\r\nwater; mak'm boat capsize. Plenty men drown finis!”\r\n\r\nThe strangers shivered and longed to return to their cool hills; but the\r\nlong-shoremen beguiled them with descriptions of the fish and the crabs\r\nand oysters the generous sea gave, and told that in the morning it would\r\nbe “quiet fella” and that they need not be afraid.\r\n\r\nWith taut-strung nerves, the highlanders approached the sea, which shone\r\nin matutinal placidity. When the ripples wavered on the smooth sand and\r\nran in caressing ripples towards their feet, they started and shrunk.\r\nThe incomprehensible ocean was alive and much to be feared, for was it\r\nnot so big that no one could see where it ended? They sat and watched\r\nits enticing gestures, and, gathering courage, stood tremulously while\r\nthe tide splashed their feet and retreated. The boldest walked in\r\nankle-deep and danced in daredevilry, and soon young and old were\r\ngambolling uncouthly, tasting the sea's quality, shouting and splashing.\r\nNone ventured more than knee-deep; some crawled and wallowed in the wet\r\nsand, too fearful to trust their lives to so big a thing which showed\r\nitself to be alive by breathing and moving. The morning was spent in\r\nmoist frolics, and when the north-easter began to work up a little sea,\r\nwhich spoke in menacing tones, the terrified strangers withdrew.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the corroboree began, many of the participators\r\nhaving spent hours in the assumption of the festive costume of the down\r\nof sulphur-crested cockatoos plastered to the skin with grease and\r\nthe blood. It is not to be supposed that white down in the hands\r\nof experienced dressers is incapable of variation in style. Several\r\noriginal designs excited the approbation of spectators. The down was\r\narranged in tufts following the perpendiculars of the body from shoulder\r\nto shin, or in a series of circles accurately spaced, or in intersecting\r\nspirals, while the heads of all performers and combatants were converted\r\ninto white mops.\r\n\r\nAnd with the clapping of hollowed hands and the clicking of boomerangs\r\nthe function began. And having danced to their own satisfaction and the\r\ndelight of the crowd, the warriors with ostentation and bluster recited\r\nprivate grievances and challenged those against whom they had real or\r\nfancied wrongs to combat. Most of the noisy declamation was ill-founded.\r\nThe many had no grievances and no intentions of fighting, but out of the\r\nshouting crowd stepped two big men who sought compensation for “another\r\nHelen.” Though not lovely or winsome or an heiress, she sufficed as the\r\nmotive for an honourable and public strife, quite as sincere as many\r\nof the scuffles without the walls of Troy. Spears and boomerangs were\r\nthrown viciously and dodged and evaded skilfully until one of the men\r\nfound a boomerang sticking fast in his leg. The wound was decisive, and\r\nwith much hullabaloo the defeated warrior limped away, while the lady,\r\nwhom niggardly Nature had denied the grace of blushing, passively went\r\nto the victor.\r\n\r\nAmong the strangers to the coast was an old man but a yard and a\r\nquarter high, with unkempt, grisly beard, a head which needed not the\r\nglorification of cockatoo's down, long, thin arms, huge hands, thick,\r\nstump legs, and sprawling feet. No far-reaching crab of the reef just\r\nshowing its worn brown tusks off-shore was more grotesque of mien and\r\ngait. To emphasise his malignant mood, he carried a huge boomerang,\r\nwhich seemed to obey and embody his whims. It sprang from his powerful\r\nhands in resolute and impetuous flight, whirred threateningly overhead,\r\nand returned to foot, fluttering and purring, as if endowed with\r\naffection for its unlovable master. None so mastered the missile; but\r\nfor all his weird influence over it, he was subject to the restraints of\r\nanother weapon which seldom left his hands. Is there not a spiritual\r\nlaw which imposes checks on the bombastic tricks of crude and cultured\r\nalike, or was it by force of gravity that the point of the dwarf's\r\nlong and slender spear dipped into the ground, punctuating mock martial\r\nstruts with perverse irregularity? Prodigious in his own estimation, his\r\njibes and taunts were almost as terrifying as the erratic flights of his\r\nboomerang; for the dwarf was a privileged individual, the Thersites\r\nof the campaign, and with one advantage over his prototype--he really\r\nwanted to fight. So he swaggered, heeding not the reproving spear; he\r\nfumed; he mocked; for no warrior affected to notice his vainglorious\r\nabsurdities. He was as much in earnest as those who fought on account\r\nof elemental love, and far more so than any of the blusterers who talked\r\nbig and looked small. He longed to fight, and for money.\r\n\r\nEach warrior was challenged individually, and when none responded he\r\nrailed against all for cowards and sent the boomerang hissing defiance\r\nagainst the blue sky, to fall with mutter and thud at his feet. In his\r\nrage the little man became hysterical, and the more he scolded the less\r\nimportant, while the swaying spear emphasised increasing agitation,\r\nbut brought him neither humility nor jibe, for the race does not\r\nintentionally relieve its drama with comedy.\r\n\r\nNo more influential personage was present than “Mooty,” the crafty,\r\ndetermined, plausible philosopher--the sagest of the counsellors, the\r\nmost flowery of orators, the most weird of the wizards. Long before\r\nhe had established his reputation as a medicine-man. A settler had\r\npurchased some cast-off goats in a distant town, and had employed a\r\nblack boy of the district as assistant drover, and the name of the boy\r\nwas Tom. Since there are many “Toms,” a distinguishing surname had to\r\nbe bestowed, so “Goat” was affixed, and as “Tom Goat” the stranger was\r\nknown. Having no sweetheart, he made love to several dusky dames, all\r\nof whom rejected him because his absurd name made him a figure for\r\nfun. Rosey, wife of Jack, was persistently courted, and scornfully she\r\ndespised her wooer. That individual, however, was not without malignant\r\nresource. Rosey complained of a sore throat, and as she got worse her\r\nboy became similarly afflicted. The faces and throats of both swelled\r\nalarmingly, so that Mooty, who had the cases in hand, gave up hope. Both\r\nwere resigned, when Mooty, to his own horror and the dismay of everyone,\r\ncaught the dread disease.\r\n\r\nNo such illness had ever been known in the district, and since it had\r\nnot only baffled Mooty's skill, but had irreverently seized him--the\r\nonly physician of credit and renown--its cause must be supernatural.\r\nThus did he reason, as he began occult investigations. Jack and Rosey\r\nlay in their camp passively dying. Mooty prowled about, the sleeves of\r\na discarded shirt tied under his distended jaws. No physical origin\r\nfor the mysterious disease was found during the two days he devoted to\r\nmethodic search and secret rite. Then an anticipated discovery rewarded\r\nhim and made his name thrill among his race. To a condescending white\r\nman he told of his skill in these terms:\r\n\r\n“Two fella him close up finis. Me bin look out camp belonga two fella.\r\nB'mbi me bin find'm little fella fork stick close up alonga groun'. Me\r\nfrait. My word, me bin pick'm up easy fella. Me look out longa little\r\nfella hole. Me bin see hair, too much, belonga Tom Goat. That hair bin\r\nmak'm two fella no good. Him mak'm me fella no good. Me catch'm that\r\nfella hair along two fella stick. Tchuck'm along ribber. My word! That\r\nfella hair no good! Him go phuff! Kill'm fish, too many. B'mbi me fella\r\ngo alonga camp. Me tell'm two fella, 'You no more mak'm die. Me bin\r\nfind'm that fella hair belonga Tom Goat.' B'mbi two fella him get up;\r\nhim no more die; he walk about.”\r\n\r\nExasperated by such impropriety, aghast at the consequences,\r\nMooty--doctor alike of laws, of science, and of medicine, and a man of\r\nimperative mood--sharpened his tomahawk at the Chinaman's grindstone,\r\ntheatrically testing its edge with distorted thumb. Tom Goat disappeared\r\nas silently as last night's dew, for Mooty does not hesitate to\r\nsummarily administer his own judgment when his professions are scorned,\r\nhis family bewitched, his countenance distorted with mumps.\r\n\r\nWith feasting and fighting, with dancing and storytelling, quarrelling\r\nand reconciliations, the assemblage spent a happy week. Then the jungle\r\nreabsorbed the nervous hillmen, and beach-combers straggled along the\r\nyellow sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANOE-MAKER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Last scene of all, . . . Is second childishness and mere oblivion.”\r\n\r\n                              SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA tottering old man, frail alike in frame and mind, squats dying in an\r\nalien camp. His teeth have almost disappeared, worn to the gums by\r\nthe mastication of food in which sand has been mingled in immoderate\r\nproportion. All his life has been spent on the verge of the sea. He has\r\nnever known smooth food. Before he left his mother's breast grit was on\r\nhis lips, for in her sleep she snoodled naked in the sand. Hers was the\r\nage of bark rugs or none, and was ever lord of the beach who shared with\r\nhis lady so rare a comfort?\r\n\r\nCounterparts of Cassowary's babyhood are extant to this\r\nday--milk-bellied, nose-neglected, fumbling-fingered toddlers, who\r\nsmash with stones almost beyond their strength infant oysters and gulp a\r\nmixture of squash and sand.\r\n\r\nAs he grew up his food, seared on a fire on the beach, was always more\r\nor less gritty. Possibly it would hardly have been relished if the\r\naccustomed condiment had been absent.\r\n\r\nFor many a long year Cassowary was a sort of king in the locality of his\r\nbirth, though this rank brought him no isolation. Now he is without rank\r\nand grim in his lonesomeness. True to the sentiments of his race, the\r\nmen and women who knew him when he was strong and lusty strive to make\r\nhim comfortable in his dotage; but he is repellent. His surliness does\r\nnot vex them. They pity and excuse and endeavour to soothe. To strangers\r\nwhom Cassowary has never loved and would now assault with spear and\r\nnulla-nulla, they apologise.\r\n\r\n“Poor fella, Cassowary. Him no good. Close up that fella finis.”\r\n\r\nThen they tell of his strange fantasies. Similar delusions have\r\nafflicted notable men of the world, and even to this day are there not\r\napprehensive monarchs whose precautions are similar to those of\r\nthe age-worn savage? He imagines that he is regarded as a useless\r\nencumbrance, and that his fellows would gladly hasten his departure to\r\nthat country on the bourne of which he painfully lingers. Suspicious of\r\nplots to rob him of the poor vestiges of life, he is ever on his guard\r\nagainst poison, his special dread. Rather than run risk he submits to\r\nsemi-starvation, for the decayed monarch of a narrow strip of shore\r\nhas no servitor on whom to impose the office of taster of his dishes. A\r\nstranger may of his goodwill offer a tribute of tobacco. It is cast away\r\nwith every manifestation of indignation and haste. He is sure that the\r\none solace of existence has been drugged, and that if he indulges he\r\nmust die. How marvellous the self-denial! How many of us would purchase\r\nhalf an hour's existence such as his at the cost of declining the one\r\nluxury of life!\r\n\r\nFlour from his master's hands is served like the stranger's tobacco,\r\nthough he may not have tasted food for days; nor does he accept a\r\nportion of the damper cooked in his presence until he has seen others\r\neat. Then he feeds reluctantly and with extreme caution, not to gratify\r\nthe palate, but to maintain life.\r\n\r\nWas ever monarch or Roman pontiff beset by more vindictive and envious\r\nfoes than this helpless old savage who possesses nothing save a grimy\r\nshirt and the fragments of a blanket?\r\n\r\nCassowary, an old man when I first met him, was of the sort which does\r\nnot make friends with white men. Silent, resolute, reserved, a man\r\napart, he disdained the race-shattering language his fellows hastened\r\nto acquire. His pidgin English, limited to a few words, was almost as\r\nunintelligible as his own rude tongue. Once I landed on the beach which\r\nwas his favourite resort, and as the anchor slipped into the sea, smoke\r\npuffed and drifted from the camp and the lonesome man's dogs barked; but\r\nby the time the camp was reached the smell of the fire had gone, and all\r\ntracks had been obliterated as if by the efficient touch of the wind.\r\nThe heat of the sand at the entrance of the dome-shaped humpy revealed\r\nthe site of the covered embers, and the rest was silence.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the humpy, concealed by carelessly disposed bark and\r\ngrass, was a bark canoe which Cassowary, fisherman and oyster-eater,\r\nwas never without. In those days he deserved the reputation of being an\r\nunrivalled maker of canoes which, during the first few weeks of their\r\nprime, were sound, neat of appearance, quite seaworthy, though of small\r\ndimensions and exceedingly light. Others might be expert fishermen and\r\nskilful in more exacting sport of turtle and dugong catching, but all\r\nacknowledged his special superiority. Though custom had made him a king,\r\nNature had designed him for a canoe-maker, while with that invincible\r\nirony with which she rebukes the self-esteem and baffles the ambitions\r\nof mortals, she discounted her gift by the bestowal of frank distrust\r\nof the sea. He was so impelled to the exercise of the one talent that\r\nduring youth and manhood his chief occupation and never-ending delight\r\nlay therein. That which his right hand had found to do he did with\r\nall his might, his frail craft being the admiration of all, while the\r\nconfidence with which others managed them proved their quality. They\r\ntoyed with the sea in its placid moods, and were deferential in its\r\nill-humour. But Cassowary never ventured beyond easy hail from the\r\nshore, however urgent the occasion or propitious the day.\r\n\r\nFear also restricted his wanderings in the bush, which kept him within\r\nsound of the dreaded waves. He was an unaffected beach-comber. Neither\r\nthe food-bestowing sea nor the safe dry land was for him.\r\n\r\nBy instinct he seemed to be guided to the best trees for bark, generally\r\nselecting “gulgong,” though others were equally pliant in his hands. Raw\r\nfrom the tree, he would soak the single sheet in water, and while sodden\r\nsteam it over a smoky fire, and, as it softened, mould it with hand\r\nand knee. Bringing the edges of the end designed for the stem into\r\napposition, using a device on the principle of the harness-maker's\r\nclamp, he sewed them together with strips of freshly cut cane.\r\nTwo stretchers gave to the craft beam, and the necessary sheer and\r\nthwart-ship stays of twisted cane stiffness. Gunwales of cane were\r\nsewn on, the stitches being cemented with gum made plastic by frequent\r\nrenderings over the fire on a flat stone, and then the canoe was\r\ncomplete save for the hand-paddles, spoon-bowl-shaped pieces of bark.\r\n\r\nEach canoe sat well down by the stern when the fisherman knelt in it,\r\ncrouching forward like a jockey on the withers of his mount, and sending\r\nit along by the alternate strokes.\r\n\r\nCassowary was wont to scan each new work with the tilted head of an\r\nartist. All the stitches were regularly spaced, and since they were\r\nburnished with smoke, the canoe became a study in brown, braided with\r\ngold, representative of something more than a means towards earning\r\na diet of fish, and inevitable grit. It was neat and of harmonious\r\ncolouring; innocent of the least touch of finery; not a scratch expended\r\non ornament. All its lines, save those of the stretchers and stays\r\nwhich stood for rigidity, were fluent. It was not made to model or\r\nmeasurement, but developed under the maker's hard hands and tough\r\nfingers--a tribute to his artistry and skill. On the water it was as\r\nblithe as a bubble.\r\n\r\nOften had the wish to possess one of Cassowary's masterpieces arisen.\r\nHe scorned barter by abandoning his property whenever the interferer\r\nappeared. When the camp was deserted while the boat was being brought\r\nto anchor there was a strong temptation to take the canoe, leaving some\r\nadequate reward. The self-denial is almost regretted, for the old\r\nman with the thin white tuft on his chin, his shyness, his hatred of\r\nstrangers, and delusions of his decrepitude, are characteristic of an\r\nage soon to be of the irrecoverable past. A canoe from such accomplished\r\nhands would have represented a complimentary record of a race deficient\r\nin the elements of history.\r\n\r\nSeveral years have elapsed since Cassowary made his last canoe. He\r\nacknowledged that his fingers had lost their cunning, but the fates\r\nordained that his ideas should blossom as his manipulatory skill\r\nwithered Gradually he became feeble in mind and body, and was wont to\r\nspend his time crouched in a rough shelter dreaming prodigious dreams.\r\nHe would wake not only his fellows, but a pitying neighbour of other\r\ncomplexion, with enthusiastic shouts announcing that a “big fella\r\nsteamer” was whistling out at sea; that it was his steamer; that it\r\ncarried two bags of flour, and tea and sugar and tobacco, and one\r\n“good fella trousis”; and he would demand help in the landing of his\r\nmerchandise. Worn with age, sleep would soon again claim him, but never\r\nand anon his great cry, hailing the phantom steamer with her beneficent\r\ncargo, would wake the poor and squalid camp.\r\n\r\nThe time came when Cassowary could no longer obtain for himself the\r\ncoarse and trivial food essential to life, and he and another outcast,\r\nblind and maimed, quartered themselves on the camp on the beach; arid\r\nin spite of fretfulnesses and suspicions, their fellows administered\r\nto their wants. Being brought face to face with facts, the State gave\r\norders which meant an old-age pension for the outcasts. The dole was\r\nliberal enough. The mistake was that it came too late.\r\n\r\nThere was no reaction, as is oft the case with those who retire after\r\nthe bustling phase to live on the bounty of the State, for Cassowary and\r\nhis blind companion had never been strenuous workers or brain-compelling\r\nmen. The pension represented unexampled abundance. It was real, and yet\r\nit came from a source almost as intangible as Cassowary's ship. Food\r\nand tobacco! What more could the heart of a casual relic of such a race\r\nwant? Actually he wanted nothing more, save, peradventure, a blanket;\r\nbut he dreamt he did, and no earthly agent could diminish the festal\r\nextravagance of the scenes among which he revelled, conducted by the\r\nenchanted sleep.\r\n\r\nCassowary had at last come to his kingdom. His time had always been his\r\nown. The ready-to-hand food gave him leisure. His days were all dreams.\r\nWeary of crouching over the fire before the opening of his humpy, he\r\nbegan to wander in the flesh as he was wont to wander in mind. He was\r\nseen a mile away from the cheerless camp, where his companions, with\r\nsmoke-dried eyes, lamented his absence.\r\n\r\nWas he searching for a tree which might provide bark for yet another\r\ncanoe--his last work, a paragon? A few days passed and it became known\r\nthat Cassowary was missing. His shrunken body disordered a patch of buff\r\nsand just above high water.\r\n\r\nHad the desolate old man, in his fancy, made the best of all canoes, and\r\nfor once ventured out to sea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO LADIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“To one, resolution; to another, a disposition to dance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNELLY, THE SHREW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the steamer from the South enters the bay, the traveller sees ahead\r\nthe fringe of houses on the low lands fronting the inlet where shipping\r\nfinds safe and convenient harbourage. To the left he may be introduced\r\nto a strip of open beach between two low points of grey granite, back\r\nfrom which are scattered groups of modest buildings and huts which form\r\nthe aboriginal settlement. The choice of the site for the settlement\r\nwas influenced by the character of the country. Although but a short\r\ndistance by sea from the port, it is isolated by its background of hard\r\nand inhospitable hills patched with almost impenetrable jungle. Few\r\nconsigned there ever leave of their own motive, however earnest the\r\nlonging may be. The home-sick realise that escape is difficult and, if\r\nsuccessful, futile, for are not the police everywhere, and strong and\r\ncompelling? Why undertake the unknown perils of unknown hills--spiritual\r\nperils more to be dreaded than physical--when capture and again\r\nbanishment are certain?\r\n\r\nNellie Oongle-bi, among whose matrimonial experiences was Tom, of this\r\nIsle, and who since his death has gone from bad to worse, had been\r\nfound under the protection of a coloured alien, sadly degenerated and\r\nsaturated with opium. For her own salvation she was transported to\r\nthe settlement afar off, with its frontier of sea and background of\r\nrepulsive hills. She went, being in the clutches of a superior force,\r\ntractably enough, but with none of her unconquerable love of country\r\nsubdued. Nelly has nothing of an attractive nature. She has a vixenish\r\ntemper at times; is always on the alert for fancied slights; is by no\r\nmeans cleanly, unless under duress; and does not hesitate to foment\r\nsubjects of quarrel. Few among her relations and friends would mourn her\r\nexile. Even her own son, Jim, was scoffingly indifferent. She was far\r\nfrom being so, but played her part well, being obedient, quite tame, and\r\never observant.\r\n\r\nShe “sat down” at the settlement, and made friends with two or three of\r\nthe women there with whom she had previously been acquainted; but while\r\nshe talked with apparent resignation, she scanned the hills, especially\r\nfixing in her mind a particular gully which leads up to a ridge\r\npromising an outlook to the south, upon which her hopes were fixed.\r\nSoon after dark on the second night she took to the bush, carrying\r\na dilly-bag and a blanket. She is now one of the population of a\r\nfar-distant settlement, the site of which happens to be within her\r\nown country. How she overcame the distance without food, friends, or\r\nresources, has to be told, though not altogether in her own language,\r\nfor such would be unintelligible to the ordinary reader.\r\n\r\nShe was determined to run away as soon as the steamer landed her, for\r\nthat part of the North was not her country, and she could not live\r\nanywhere else. Besides, she was “sorry belonga that boy Jim.” During the\r\nfirst night of her homeward pilgrimage she never ceased walking among\r\nrocks and through the scrub, for she was fearful of being recaptured.\r\nWithout pause she clambered on until well into the next day, when she\r\nslept for a little while. Then on again until dark. One big “mung-um”\r\n (mountain) stood in the hopeful direction. Thitherwards she hastened,\r\nlosing count of the days and nights. Nelly has no conception of figures\r\nbeyond one, two, and a great many. The climbing of the mountain\r\noccupied many days. She was bewildered, for she could not “catch'm\r\nthat sal'water” which would lead her home. At last from a spur of the\r\nmountain she saw the sea--“L-o-n-g way. Too far. Me close up sing out.”\r\n Though she might cry, the sight of big salt water beside which all her\r\nlife had been spent was a joy and a stimulant. Pushing and worming her\r\nway through the jungle, she encountered nothing but birds, wallabies,\r\nand snakes.\r\n\r\nOnce she was startled by what seemed to be a worn narrow track.\r\nAdvancing cautiously along it, she came across a huge carpet snake\r\ncoiled “all a same rope alonga boat.” It was asleep where an opening in\r\nthe roof of vegetation made a patch of sunlight on the jungle floor, and\r\nshe passed by, treading noiselessly. For food she had the fruits of the\r\njungle, crude, harsh, and bitter. Food, indeed, was almost repugnant,\r\nfor her thoughts were concentrated on her country, so she hastened down\r\ntowards the now hidden sea. Far inland she heard its welcome noise--a\r\ngreeting and a call from home which made her forgetful of all weariness\r\nand fret.\r\n\r\nIn course of time--a weak woman carrying a blanket and living on\r\ninnutritious foods does not struggle through jungle at any remarkable\r\nspeed--the foothills and then the low-lying country at the junction\r\nof two rivers were reached. Here she took off her few and bedraggled\r\ngarments, and, making them into a bundle with her blanket and bag, waded\r\nthrough swamps, eventually emerging on a sandy beach, which she intended\r\nto follow until she regained her country, many a weary mile to the\r\nsouth. Providence provided an easy means of crossing the estuary of the\r\nrivers--a kindly white man, owner of a “little fella boat, little fella\r\ningin.” To him she told the story of her escape and her longing for her\r\nown country and her own people, and was ferried across. Then she picked\r\nup a camp of her race, the members of which, sympathising with her,\r\naccompanied her on her way for a couple of days. One day she woke from\r\nher sleep on the edge of the mangroves with her blanket sopping with\r\nblood which had flowed from her mouth and nose during sleep. “Me bin\r\nsorry belonga that boy Jim. Me bin sorry belonga country. That 'nother\r\ncountry no good belonga me. Me think me die. Me walk alonga sandy beach.\r\nSome time alonga b-i-g fella rock. Me close up tumble down altogether.\r\nMe tired. B'mbi catch'm Liberfool Crik (Liverpool Creek). Plenty fella\r\nsit down. He bin sing out, 'Hello! You come back from that place?' Me\r\nbin say 'Yes; that country no good belonga me.'”\r\n\r\nA month or so after Nelly was again found in the service of a coloured\r\nalien, tugging away with another weak gin at what she calls a “two-fella\r\nsaw.” For her task of sleeper-cutting her reward would probably be a\r\nhandful of rice and a dose of opium per day.\r\n\r\nNelly is now at her leisure within a mile or so from the place of\r\nher birth, hardly conscious of the feat represented by her solitary\r\npilgrimage. Occasionally she has the company of her tall and indifferent\r\nboy. She enjoys the society of her relations, and indulges as oft as\r\nmay be in exhilarating misunderstandings with them. Without a vehement\r\nsquabble now and again life would be intolerably insipid. Anger,\r\naccompanied by fluent abuse, is to her a kind of spiritual blood-letting\r\nfor the casement of her suddenly plethoric temperament. But such is of\r\nher frailty. Proof of her strength of purpose, has it not been given?\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIA DANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her youth Maria gave promise of a rare condition among coastal\r\nblacks--tendency to width and breadth. As she grew in bulk she seemed,\r\nif not to decrease in stature, at least to remain stationary. Thus it\r\nwas that her figure became perfect.\r\n\r\nIf there be one feature of animal physiology more adorable than aught\r\nelse in the eyes of the lords of the soil, it is fat--fat under any\r\nand every circumstance. They admire it in animals of the chase, and\r\nthe paltry, greasy relics of a feast may be smeared over the body with\r\nsomething of the pride and gratification derivable in other and cleaner\r\nwalks of life from perfumed powder, pink and white.\r\n\r\nBeing fat and shiny as a girl, Maria had keen and ardent lovers. She was\r\nan adorable novelty.\r\n\r\nBlacks do not gaze into the faces of their sweethearts. They have\r\nnever found chaste delight in the writing of woeful ballads to their\r\nmistress's eyebrows, or to the glorification of their snubby and\r\nexpansive noses. If any of Maria's admirers had been lyrical, her buxom\r\ncondition would have been the theme of their idealisations. In time she\r\nbecame the mother of children, still retaining that charming superiority\r\nof bulk which excited the rage of sisters whose skins did not shine,\r\nwhose flesh did not quiver whensoever they walked, talked, or even\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nNo marvel that her matrimonial experiences were the comment of the camp\r\nand gave rise to many differences, but, since placidity and fat have\r\nbeen known among so-called civilised peoples to blend in the individual,\r\nMaria's demeanour called for no comment. It was not her fault, but the\r\nflightiness and whimsicality of Nature which had contrived to make her\r\nthe belle of the camp. And why not enjoy the obvious admiration of the\r\nstalwart youths as well as the discomfort of the sisters who had not an\r\nounce of irresistible fascination of which to boast.\r\n\r\nFor some years the form of Maria had not waddled across accustomed\r\nscenes. Quite unexpectedly it loomed up as large and buoyant as ever.\r\nThe light-hearted denizens of the camp had arranged an evening's\r\nentertainment. The fires burned low, the sea babbled, making\r\nwhite-skirted frolic on the hard level sand, and the piping voices of\r\nthe honey-seeking flying foxes among the tea-trees seemed to chide\r\nthe parrots of the day for having left so little refreshment in the\r\nblossoms. Behind a screen of faded blankets the warriors of the camp\r\nwere adorning themselves with white clay and feathers and long, shaggy\r\nbeards of bark, while the leader of the orchestra began to tune his\r\nboomerang and fire-hardened sticks, and his attendants to squat ready to\r\ndrum on thighs and lap with hollowed hand in time with his refrain and\r\nclicking music. The fires flared up, and the band emerged with thumping\r\nstep and emphatic grunts to illustrate the ceremonious visit of\r\nstrangers to a camp at which the nature of the reception was in doubt.\r\nOne individual, in chalk for the most part, advanced, half nervously,\r\nhalf anxiously, to the musician, and modestly retired, and advanced\r\nagain and retired, until reassured, and then the crowd came forward\r\nwhirling and grunting, and, with high-waving arms in unison and swaying\r\nbodies, gave token of happiness.\r\n\r\nACT II.--The master of ceremonies carried to the front a big and rough\r\nsapling. The fires glowed again, the orchestra clicked and thumped, and\r\na single boy in an ancient red handkerchief and chalks danced into the\r\nlight, and, keeping time with the music, began in pantomime to fashion\r\nthe sapling into a sword, using a fictitious shell, with which he\r\nscraped off imaginary bark. While absorbed in his work, his companions\r\ncame from the screen in haste, skipping round him and mimicking all his\r\nactions and grunting in unison with him, while making the sand-ridge to\r\nquiver with intensity of tread. Presently all flopped down on haunches\r\nin close formation round the sword-maker, still maintaining rhythmical\r\nsway of body and limb, and while some held the sapling, others toiled\r\nstrenuously towards the completion of a good and true weapon, the master\r\nof ceremonies encouraging and exhorting the workers until nature could\r\nhold out no longer, and they bounded to their feet and, with grunts\r\nand signs and with bodies reeking with perspiration, whirled away into\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nACT III.--Each of the noisy players came suddenly into the glare\r\ncarrying a rotund, compact bundle, and, squatting down, began with\r\ngrunts and sighs the great “coco-nut” act, obviously one of the\r\nmasterpieces of the corroboree. In perfect time the sham coco-nuts\r\nwere beaten with hands in lieu of sticks or tomahawks, while the\r\naccompaniment became faster and faster. Ever and anon each, still\r\nrocking, would peer closely at his prize to satisfy himself as to its\r\nquality, and forthwith continue the resonant belabouring of the shell,\r\nuntil the meat therein was available with joyous shout.\r\n\r\nACT IV.--Most of the accumulated bark and leaves having by this time\r\npassed into flame and smoke, the attendants raided the nearest gunyah\r\nfor fresh supplies of material for illumination. The big fires lit up\r\nthe arena anew, and, marshalled by the conductor, the band rushed out\r\nof the darkness uttering grunts which rang a change on the monotony of\r\nprevious vocal efforts. A masterpiece of composition, it conjured up the\r\ndimness of the jungle and the smell of damp vegetation. All squatted in\r\na double ring, back to back. This formation was not strictly maintained,\r\nfor each individual made half turns to right and left alternately,\r\nsimultaneously scratching the sand with distended fingers and kicking\r\nvigorously until the sand ascended in the smoke-tinged glow, heads\r\nbowing and ducking with mechanical regularity, as the entertainers\r\nsought--and with conspicuous success--to portray a community of scrub\r\nturkeys building an incubating mound.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the favourite and belle of the camp, the fascinating\r\ncreature whose magnificent condition bestowed privileges undreamt of\r\nby other ladies, became conspicuous. Her costume had evidently been\r\ndesigned for a lady not divinely tall, but considerably less of flesh\r\nthan the wearer. Maria did not actually overflow, though perilously near\r\nthat point. Surely buttons were never designed to resist such strain.\r\nColoured ladies generally sit meekly among the audience and chatter\r\nand maintain the drum-beats, lacking which no corroboree could be\r\nsuccessful. During the intervals they may emboss pictures in the\r\nimpressionable sand with cunning forefinger and giggle, for the subjects\r\nare often quaint. Maria, sure of her privileges, waddled out from the\r\nflame-obscuring dusk, turned an ample back upon the double ring of boys,\r\nand played her part as one of the giddy and industrious wild-fowls. Her\r\nfingers scratched the air and her feet the dust with a realism not to\r\nbe excelled by the most gifted of the boys, while her half grunt, half\r\nchuckle, exactly imitative of the social garrulity of the turkey, gave\r\nartistic finish to a scene which would have been absolutely delusive\r\nif feathers had been in fashion. Maria, a fleer at mere ponderosity,\r\nskipped and whisked from left to right with fay-like airiness of foot\r\nuntil a thrill of delight went through the camp. The frolicsome turkeys\r\nscratched and scattered leaves that were not, and gobbled and clucked,\r\nuntil, panting and perspiring, all rose, and with a simultaneous\r\nshout scampered for the screen, while the master of ceremonies shouted\r\n“Finis!” The music ceased, the flames faded, and substantial Maria\r\ndissolved in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOOSIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No legend! Well, let us invent one.”--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crinkled fist, fumbling and twisting, protruded from a rent in a\r\ndilapidated dilly-bag. It had done so with infinite feebleness for many\r\nan hour in unavailing protest against the woes and weight of life, for\r\nfaint scratch smeared with blood denoted the friction of tender skin\r\nagainst the broken edges of the cane-made bag.\r\n\r\nA scarcely audible, inhuman wail--pathetically staccato--told of\r\nunceasing pain. Whomsoever the bag contained was enduring martyrdom.\r\n\r\n“That fella, him no good. Close up finis. B'mbi me plant'm along scrub.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke the pleasant-faced gin who passed with the dilly-bag along a\r\nnarrow aisle of the jungle, intent upon ridding herself of a vexatious\r\nencumbrance, and at the same time performing the rite of unrighteous\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nSquirming in dirt was a naked infant-black, foul, and but a few days\r\nold.\r\n\r\n“Mother belonga that fella him dead--finis. That fella, him no good. Him\r\nsing out all a time. More better tchuck'm away.”\r\n\r\nFrail outcast--the very scum of a blacks' camp, its repulsiveness was\r\ntragic. Dirt and odour sickened, yet its appeal was irresistible. That\r\nuniversal language, a human cry, which everywhere and always quickened\r\nthe pulse, stirred pity to its depths. I seized the stained bag (it\r\nwas a desperate deed) and, breaking down its worn sides, displayed its\r\ncontents--a girl in all the infamy of neglect, starvation, and dirt--a\r\npanting mummy reeking with offence.\r\n\r\nSpreading out a handkerchief, I put the awful atom on it gingerly, while\r\nthe foster-mother reiterated her counsel to “tchuck'm alonga scrub.”\r\n\r\nIn the guise of a frail bundle at arm's-length was Soosie conducted to a\r\ncivilised home.\r\n\r\nDismay tempered with pity greeted her.\r\n\r\n“How horrible! How dirty!”\r\n\r\n“Is it really a little girl? It looks like a wild animal.”\r\n\r\n“Do let me nurse it.”\r\n\r\nThus was crinkled-faced Soosie welcomed.\r\n\r\nMany successive baths did she endure, faintly wailing, until dirt soaked\r\noff and the wails ceased for the time being as Soosie sucked ravenously\r\nat a tiny sugar-bag.\r\n\r\nWhat a frail little life it was--feeble beyond expression, and ugly\r\nwith the ugliness of savagery. She wriggled and screwed up her skinny\r\nfeatures with inane ferocity. A motherless wallaby would have submitted\r\nto human solace and ministrations with daintier mien; but the whole\r\nhousehold thrilled with excitement. Could the spluttering spark of life\r\nbe made to glow? That was the all-absorbing topic for days. Gradually\r\nsome sort of a human rotundity became manifest, and on the occasion\r\nof the bath it was more and more apparent that instead of being\r\nimpenetrably black the skin-tint was a mingling of pale brown and pink;\r\nand as regular nourishment began to be effective the features changed,\r\nlosing their gross animalism.\r\n\r\nJust because of the waif's helplessness was repugnance to her conquered.\r\nShe had no other redeeming quality. In a certain sense she was fearsome;\r\nshe required unremitting attention and care; her whimpering fits,\r\nin beast-like monotone, shook the nerve of the most patient of her\r\nattendants. She was a charge to keep and foster, and the duty was\r\nperformed with devotion, which took little concern for self-sacrifice.\r\nBefore many months had passed Soosie had been transformed into a fat\r\nroly-poly with a perpetual smile and gurgles of satisfaction, which even\r\nvocalised sleep.\r\n\r\nAll this happened years ago. In infancy Soosie had been informally\r\nadopted. She was now a bright, sensible, slender girl, whose full,\r\nmelting eyes pleaded for inevitable facial defects, and whose complexion\r\nwas very greatly at fault. She grew up more averse from the manners\r\nand moods of her mother than those of us who better understand the\r\ndifferences of race. To her a black was more abhorrent than a snake.\r\nShe loathed the sight of those who came about the place, and would not\r\ndefile herself by touching the cleanest--kind-hearted “Wethera,” who had\r\nso nearly interred her, and to whom she was as a princess; “Wethera,”\r\n who was wont to say, “That fella Tchoosie, too flash. Close up me bin\r\ntchuck'm away. Boss he bin catch'm.”\r\n\r\nSoosie evaded all possible reference to her kin, and when others spoke\r\nin sympathetic terms would say: “How can you bear to think of those\r\nhorrible people who live in dirt and only half dressed in the bush? I\r\nlove the scrub, and but for them would like to wander in it all day. I\r\ndare not while they are about, for some day one of them might touch me,\r\nand I would never feel clean again.”\r\n\r\nWe often wondered at the irreconcilable attitude which Soosie (she was\r\nalways “Miss Soosie” to all but members of the household) adopted to her\r\nown race, for she well understood where she had been born and the manner\r\nof her salvation from imminent death.\r\n\r\nThough no special training had been hers, none of the domestic arts were\r\nunknown to her. She acquired them with ease and practised them with the\r\nair of a dignified princess and neat-handed facility. While the other\r\nchildren of the house stewed over lessons and rebelled against essential\r\ntasks, to Soosie everything seemed to make for holiday. She read\r\nvoraciously, so that her application of English became so keen that she\r\nwas the first to detect verbal dissonances. She, the youngest of two\r\ngirls and a boy, would often correct their speech, not as a budding\r\npedant, but because her ears were delicately attuned to the music of the\r\ntongue and could not, without offence, hearken to discords. She was an\r\naffected prude. Her self-chosen style of dress, her pose, her disdainful\r\nairs, her repugnance to coarse work, her inclination towards occupations\r\nand pastimes which involved isolation, showed that self-consciousness\r\nruled her life. She lived within herself, and her life was gentle,\r\ncontrasting with the boisterous playfulness of her foster sisters and\r\nbrother, upon whose romps she smiled indulgently, but in which she\r\nnever took part. In her own estimation she was a girl quite out of the\r\nordinary, and one to whom the most honoured of guests must be polite, if\r\nnot deferential. She exacted little niceties of demeanour from all,\r\nher equals and inferiors, for was she not treated as a daughter of the\r\nhouse? Often, however, in her preoccupied moods would she assume an air\r\nof detachment and jealousy towards the other children, for she could not\r\nbut contrast herself with them. They were white; she was pronouncedly of\r\nthe despised race. How wistfully would she scan the face of strangers!\r\nHow teeming with resentment against fate her inevitable conclusions!\r\nIn all save features she was white. Over her inheritance, the cruellest\r\nwhich fortune could bestow, she was shudderingly horrified. Not all the\r\nlongings of an untainted mind could make her skin less tawny. Its stain\r\nwas too deep to be blanched by the most fervent of prayers. Her outlook\r\non life, her intensest wishes, were those of a white girl of more\r\nthan decent perceptions--of actual refinement, for they tended to the\r\navoidance of everything unpleasant and unsightly. In other respects,\r\ntoo, she was an absolute variant from the type, for her sensitiveness to\r\nthe pain of others and of the lower animals amounted almost to a mania;\r\nfor though she had a girlish horror of blood, her eagerness to solace\r\nsufferings made her so courageous that she became most apt and prompt\r\nin the administration of first aid. Her big, startled eyes showed\r\nthe sincerity of her feelings, while her firm, slender fingers deftly\r\napplied bandages as she spoke in soothing tones.\r\n\r\nThe soul of a white damsel was in habitation of the body of one whose\r\nparents had been black and utterly degraded. In the days of old evil\r\nspirits were believed to be capable of taking spiteful possession of the\r\nbodies of the weak to work, in unseemlinesses and indecencies, for the\r\nmischief of the soul. Here was a good and gentle spirit which strove\r\nundemonstratively for the salvation of a being the circumstances of\r\nwhose birth bordered on the infernal. It was as if the baths of infancy\r\nhad purified the soul, while the permanence and perversity of blood\r\ntriumphed in feature and complexion.\r\n\r\nWhile the other children of the house deserved and obtained love\r\nand affection in full measure, towards Soosie were exhibited similar\r\nsentiments, with, perhaps, more consideration, for was it not plain that\r\nher life was a continual conflict--a conflict between body and soul--a\r\nbody self-abhorred, a soul which needed no purification?\r\n\r\nA creek which had its source in a ravine of the huge mountain which\r\nintercepted the rising sun and caused accustomed shadow an hour after\r\nthe illumination of the western hills, ran past the lonely little\r\nhouse, which stood in a clearing the upright walls of which were on the\r\nsky-line scalloped with fan-palms. For many years Soosie never ventured\r\ninto the jungle unaccompanied, yet she seemed to possess a sense of\r\nhappenings beyond the almost solid screen of vegetation. Primal instinct\r\ncontended against her affections and her love for a sheltered, clean\r\nlife. Though she had always avoided association with the children of the\r\ncamp, and her knowledge by imitation or precept was negative, yet\r\nwas the bush an open book to her. She knew when and where to look for\r\nbirds'-nests. She knew at a glance a venomous from a non-venomous snake,\r\nan edible from an inedible nut. As a child her favourite head-dress was\r\na squat, fat mantis, the bright orange and yellow of which contrasted\r\nboldly with her fuzzy, coarse hair; and when the insect palled as an\r\nornament it would be frizzled and slyly eaten.\r\n\r\nOnce as we strolled on the bank of the creek gazing at the lazy,\r\nred-finned fish among the swaying weeds, her wandering eyes detected\r\na neat circular bore in the trunk of a huge silky oak. Having shrewdly\r\nscrutinised the bark, she judged the tenant to be at home. With a\r\nportion of one of the “feelers” of creeping palm stripped of all the\r\nprickles save two, she probed the tunnel and, screwing the instrument\r\ntriumphantly, withdrew a huge white grub, which she ate forthwith; and\r\nthen, with a grimace, assumed an air of shame and contrition, for she\r\nhad astonished herself as well as others by an exhibition of untaught\r\nbush-craft and ancestral appetite.\r\n\r\nShe more than once confessed in shamefaced terms to an almost\r\nuncontrollable impulse to rush away to the mountain, that she might\r\nsolace herself with the solitude and food in plenty there; but that when\r\nshe conjured up the chance of meeting some “dreadful native” she thanked\r\nGod for home and loving companions. How frequent and how intense was\r\nthis unconfessed lust for the bush we knew not.\r\n\r\nWhen Soosie was fourteen there came to the neighbourhood a hardy young\r\nfellow who began to clear a small area of jungle land; for civilisation,\r\nwhich had been marking time for nigh upon two decades, now marched\r\nslowly, and to no throb of drum, in our direction. Times were changing,\r\nand in some details less desirable conditions arose. The infinite\r\nprivacy of the bush suffered. The little clearing was no longer our own.\r\nSoosie's demeanour became more reposeful. She had seemed to think that\r\nit might be her fate, in common with others, to become a ward of the\r\nState at some mission-station; but as settlement advanced, though still\r\nmiles away, for we were the furthest out, and no interfering guardian of\r\nthe peace came to enforce officialdom and insist upon obedience to the\r\nletter of the law, it was comforting to reflect that this unofficial\r\ndaughter might be permitted to live out her life unhampered even by the\r\ngoodwill expressed, in the first stages, by the visit of a policeman.\r\n\r\nHer presence was necessary, not only on account of her amiable\r\ndisposition and self-sacrificing ways, but for the actual load she bore\r\nof the duties of a quiet home. We had failed, however, to take into\r\ncalculation the chances of another means of separation. There was now\r\nno disguising the fact that our new neighbour, Dan, was casting sheep's\r\neyes in Soosie's direction, and to her evident dismay. It was of little\r\navail to upbraid him as to the unseemliness of attachment to a girl who,\r\nhowever civilised, was of inferior race and despised colour. He frankly\r\nconfessed that he wanted a wife as a companion and helpmeet; that he\r\ncould not hope, in consideration of his own lowly birth and slender\r\nmeans and uphill task, to induce a white girl to halve his loneliness.\r\nHe had studied Soosie, and was sure that she was his superior except\r\nin matter of colour. She was far better schooled and had been used to\r\nsofter life.\r\n\r\n“What,” he asked, “don't you and the Missis and Miss Clare and Fan, and\r\nBob, here, love her? You couldn't help it; and you are not ashamed. You\r\ntreat her as your own child. It would be no sin for me to take her as my\r\nown wife. If she'll have me I'll marry her before the best parson in\r\nthe North. What of her complexion? It's only a little more sunburnt than\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nBut Soosie was shy--more than shy. Her sensitiveness amounted to\r\nphysical repulsion. She declared that, though she liked Dan, she would\r\nnever marry.\r\n\r\n“I do feel in my heart that I am nothing more than a black girl, and\r\nalmost a savage. What if some day the horrible part of me got stronger,\r\nand I did go to the mountain by myself? I have heard you say that blood\r\nwill tell. Often I am frightened of myself, especially when the nights\r\nare very still and I listen to the scrub hens chuckling and the flying\r\nfoxes squealing, and smell the scents of the scrub. It must be very\r\nnice to live away from everybody in the very loneliest part of the big\r\nmountain, and to feel at home with actually wild things.”\r\n\r\nThere was no affectation between us, so I said in comfort: “But my dear\r\ngirl, you are whiter at heart than many a girl born white. It is only\r\nyour skin that is dark. Perhaps if in a year or so you did marry Dan it\r\nwould be the best, for a good woman, no matter what her complexion, will\r\nalways earn respect. Society may not want you, but you would not want\r\nsociety; and it will be very many years before society hampers life in\r\nthis part of the bush.”\r\n\r\nSoosie thought for a few minutes, and then replied with delicate\r\ndiscretion. “I can never marry Dan. Sooner or later he would despise\r\nme. It might be all right while I was young, but--we--we--blacks get\r\nold very soon. Fancy Dan having an old gin in his house; for he won't be\r\nliving in a one-roomed hut all his life!”\r\n\r\n“You are spiteful against yourself, and that's not like you, Soosie.”\r\n\r\n“I have my feelings. How else may I restrain them?” she petulantly\r\nexclaimed. “He must never think of me. It might drive me to the\r\nmountain--just to save him from me.”\r\n\r\nDan, good fellow, was discreet. He decided to play the laggard in love,\r\nrealising that any show of impetuosity might frighten Soosie. It came\r\nto be understood that in time she might see the wisdom of accepting\r\nhim, and I, knowing both, and to whom mixed marriages are abhorrent,\r\nwas convinced that no girl could have been better qualified to fill the\r\nposition of a bushman's wife. Modest, clever, sympathetic, healthful,\r\nnone of the stains of the town had ever tarnished her mind. Her\r\nvoice was that of a well-schooled white girl, and all her perceptions\r\ncoincided. If the wander lust was to be suppressed for ever, it seemed\r\nto me that Soosie must marry, and marry young.\r\n\r\nWhile Soosie's demeanour was still the cause of earnest solicitude, a\r\nperplexing complication arose. An old man of the camp whence she had\r\nbeen discarded began to do his best to attract her attention.\r\n\r\nGifts of birds'-nests, eggs, ferns, orchids in flower, a cassowary\r\nchick, neat dilly-bags, gay with crude Pigments, were brought to the\r\nhouse with messages such as this:\r\n\r\n“That fella 'Pad-oo-byer' he bin gib'em alonga 'Ky-ee-rah.'”\r\n\r\n“Ky-ee-rah” (the evening star) had been proclaimed to be Soosie's\r\ntotemic name, and “Pad-oo-byer” we knew as “Duckbill,” because of a\r\nfancied resemblance to a platypus.\r\n\r\nThe gifts were tearfully repudiated. They seemed to announce that\r\nSoosie, was regarded by her mother's kin as one of themselves,\r\nnotwithstanding her civilised environment.\r\n\r\nThough for the girl's sake, not on account of any personal repugnance or\r\ndespiteful attitude, the blacks had been kept at arm's length, I was on\r\ngood terms with all in the district, and took interest in their doings\r\nand folk-lore. One of their primary beliefs was that children, black\r\nand white, were actually the produce of the locality, belonging, not to\r\nchance parents, but to the very land on which they were born. The germs\r\nof life, they assumed, came from the soil; the soil assimilated all\r\nflesh after death. Infants were but phases of the life with which the\r\nsoil teemed. All the neighbourhood belonged to the camp--the land and\r\neverything which sprang from it, for they were the original possessors.\r\nIt was their country. They argued that such things as sweet potatoes,\r\npumpkins and mangoes, the very roses which adorned a sprawling bush, the\r\nrichly tinted crotons, the flaunting alamanda over the gateway, were,\r\nstrictly speaking, common property. So, too, over those children born\r\non the place certain proprietary rights were claimed. They were akin\r\nto them, alien to their parents. Whites and blacks born in the same\r\ndistrict must, according to their ideas, be more closely related\r\nthan folks whose birthplaces were separated by distances beyond\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nSuch being the general opinion, fortified by undeviating oral tradition,\r\nin Soosie's case the theory was ever so much the more arguable. She was\r\nclaimed, not alone on the grounds that she was a native of their own\r\nland, but because, having been born in their own camp, she must be\r\nsubject to it.\r\n\r\nDuckbill intercepted me on the edge of the clearing one morning\r\nespecially to propound the law of the land.\r\n\r\nSoosie, he told in his pidgin English, had been given to him by her\r\nuncle. She was to be his gin now that she was grown up. “More better you\r\nhunt that fella. Him want sit down alonga camp.”\r\n\r\nThe bald proposition shook me, for I could not but see the logic of it\r\nfrom Duckbill's standpoint. He was the “big man,” a wizard--ugly, old,\r\nand villainously dirty. Here was the camp's husband for the coloured\r\ngirl with the white heart. The idea was revolting, and then and there I\r\nresolved at whatever cost to save the girl from such degradation.\r\n\r\n“Clear out!” I shouted, assuming frantic anger. “You fella chuck'm\r\nSoosie away when she little fella piccaninny. That one belonga me now.\r\nSuppose you fella kick'm up row big fella government come clear you\r\nfella out. No more let you sit down longa this country.”\r\n\r\n“Country belonga me. You no humbug. You bin catch'm that fella Tchoosie\r\nl-o-n-g time. You bin make'm good fella. Belonga me now.”\r\n\r\nThe disgusting old fellow went on to explain that he intended to come up\r\nto the house that evening. “You hunt'm that fella Tchoosie, me catch'm.\r\nNo good belonga you.”\r\n\r\nI was to drive the gently nurtured girl out of the house so that this\r\nfoul creature might seize her as he would a struggling wallaby, and take\r\nher to live a degraded life in the camp! Explanations and threats were\r\nof no avail. Duckbill, who was unable to comprehend that he and others\r\nof the camp had by abandonment forfeited all rights to Soosie and that\r\nshe was now a “white Mary,” made it plain that he would forcibly\r\nabduct her if I would but give him the slight assistance of expulsion.\r\nOtherwise he would catch her himself.\r\n\r\nThreatening the camp with the presence of the “big fella government” if\r\nhe or any of them dared to interfere, I went off, while he shouted his\r\norders to “hunt that fella close up karrie badgin!” (sunset).\r\n\r\nForthwith the house was put in a state of semi-siege. Soosie, with\r\ntearful eyes and tremulous hands, hysterically implored us to protect\r\nher from a fate worse than death. A message brought Dan, who first\r\ndisdained to take Duckbill seriously. Told how Soosie had been wooed\r\nwith gifts, and that her maternal uncle had officiously bestowed her\r\nupon the gaunt, ill-favoured king of the camp in accordance with tribal\r\nlaw, which regarded her as a mere chattel at the disposal of the\r\nwhim and fancy of the nearest relative or at the demand of the most\r\nauthoritative man, he became concerned and installed himself as Soosie's\r\nspecial guardian.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after sundown Duckbill appeared, quite unconscious of\r\noffence against civilised customs, carrying a waddy with which to\r\nadminister an anodyne should his capture prove the least refractory.\r\nThreats and scoldings were lost. He was incapable of comprehending\r\nwhy there should be a moment's hesitation about the fulfilment of his\r\nlegitimate rights and demands.\r\n\r\nThough protests were vain, the fact that Soosie did not show herself\r\nimparted some glimmering of sense of the situation to him, and he\r\nwandered off in the gloom grumbling “That fella too flash,” and frankly\r\nannouncing “B'mbi me catch'm.”\r\n\r\nFor weeks Soosie kept within doors, or if she ventured out was\r\naccompanied by one or other well able and determined to protect her. Her\r\nnerves were at acute tension; her life that of a hunted creature; for\r\nthough she thought her fate inevitable, she concentrated her mind on\r\nwhat seemed to others pitiably weak and inconsequent schemes for the\r\nbafflement of Duckbill.\r\n\r\nWas it that some ineffaceable trait told her that the tribal law as\r\nexpounded by Duckbill was so wise that resistance to it was vain, and\r\nthat the trivial plans over which she worried were merely invented as a\r\nsort of temporary palliative? She scorned the possibility of existence\r\nin the camp, yet strove to contest it by the use of fantastical devices.\r\nShe urged that Dan and I should get some fearsome masks and rush the\r\ncamp in the gloom, at the same time setting off fireworks, and so create\r\nsuch terrifying effects that none would venture near the spot again.\r\nWith bated breath, she even suggested that I should make a “death-bone”\r\n to be employed for the secret ill of Duckbill; she thus exposed the\r\ndross of hereditary superstition which rose to the surface during mental\r\nebullition.\r\n\r\nIt was quite in the nature of things that under stress such a nature\r\nshould break down. She nestled close to Dan, promising to be his\r\nsweetheart on the condition that, rather than that Duckbill should take\r\nher away, he would shoot her. If it came about that the dreadful black\r\nman was himself driven off or disposed of by some other means and the\r\ncountry made safe for her, then she would marry the man who had saved\r\nher, and she hoped that she might never disgrace him.\r\n\r\nDan accepted the guardianship. His hut was two miles away and on the far\r\nside of the river. He saw little of it for the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nDuckbill and his friends, as we were well aware, knew of our plans for\r\nthe defeat of his proposed outrage. If Soosie could be ceremoniously\r\nmarried to the faithful Dan, no black in the neighbourhood would\r\nendeavour to molest her. Indeed, all, even to Duckbill, would be\r\nflattered and demonstrative of pride in the alliance.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Duckbill again intercepted me. Since the previous\r\nverbal encounter I had gone armed. He carried, somewhat ostentatiously,\r\na tomahawk and a couple of nulla-nullas.\r\n\r\n“No good you keep'm that fella Tchoosie. Me bin look out plenty. That\r\nfella belonga me. Suppose you no lat'm come, more worse b'mbi. Me want\r\nmak'm that fella all asame black fella. You gib it Clare belonga Dan.”\r\n\r\nMy fingers twitched on the butt of the revolver. It was an ultimatum.\r\nThat which from other lips would have been resented as complacent\r\ninsolence had to be endured with apparent calmness. Threatening him\r\nwith all the consequences of a visit from the “big fella government,” I\r\nhurriedly left, for I was not too sure of self-control.\r\n\r\nA stricter watch than ever was maintained, for the least relaxation of\r\nprecautions might have involved results for which a lifetime of regrets\r\nwould not have atoned. Though of such a low type of the human race, the\r\nNorth Queensland aboriginal possesses certain admirable characteristics.\r\nHis mind seldom swerves from a set purpose within view of attainment.\r\nHe may be rebuffed and disappointed, and may assume indifference to or\r\nforgetfulness of his purpose; but in his heart he does not accept defeat\r\nuntil an absolutely decisive blow is received. Invisible to us, the old\r\nman persistently waited, and watched. The dogs frequently detected\r\nhis presence, if their eloquent alarms and their excursions were to\r\nbe credited. Though she continued to pit her wits against the secret\r\ncunningness of the dreaded old man, Soosie was often preoccupied,\r\nseeming to regard herself as one not primarily concerned. Her calmness\r\nwas preternatural, contrasting strangely with her previous petulant\r\nagitation and tragic despair. She avoided Dan, while clinging with\r\nprofuse demonstrations of affection to her foster-sisters.\r\n\r\nThe reason for her change of policy and manner was revealed with\r\ndistressing suddenness. At daylight one morning the door of the room in\r\nwhich she slept under lock and key was wide open, and on her quaintly\r\nembellished table a primly written note:\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR MUM,\r\n\r\n“That horrible man who wants to take me away is right, and the Bible is\r\nright. I belong to this country, and must go. I would rather die than go\r\nto the camp; but I must know the big mountain. The dreadful people don't\r\ngo there. They are frightened of it; I love it. I shall live there by\r\nmyself till I die, and Dan will never be disgraced. You and Dada and\r\nClare and Fan and Bob have been all the world to me. You did your best\r\nto make me white at heart; but since this trouble began I have thought\r\nand thought, and found that the black in me smudges all the good out.\r\nDon't try to come after me. I shall hide. I would be too much ashamed\r\never to look at you again. Forget me, for I am nothing but an ungrateful\r\nlittle savage.\r\n\r\n“SOOSIE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all haste Dan and I set out for the camp, a mile or so further in\r\nthe jungle. It was situated in a natural, symmetrical clearing, a circus\r\nhemmed in by sullen vegetation, and upon which no plant save blady grass\r\never invaded.\r\n\r\nThe camp was deserted. Save for a few still warm spots indicative\r\nof artfully smothered fires, there were few signs to indicate recent\r\noccupation. An hour's search revealed definite tracks leading east--to\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nNo pains had been taken to baffle pursuers. Apparently the blacks had\r\njust wandered off aimlessly in obedience to a whim of the moment. There\r\nwas nothing but conjecture to support the opinion that the decampment\r\nhad anything to do with the disappearance of Soosie. Probably the blacks\r\nwere aware, in advance of ourselves, that she had stolen away. If so,\r\nthey would inevitably get her, having, possibly, the advantage of hours\r\nof start and being efficient in the art of tracking. Our plan was to\r\nhasten so that we might, if fortune favoured, be in time to save the\r\ndistracted girl from the repulsive and obscene ceremonies to which she\r\nwould be subject if she fell into the hands of Duckbill.\r\n\r\nAn hour's walk brought us to the foothills of the mountain. The tracks\r\nturned abruptly north, winding indeterminately as if no special object\r\nhad been in view. It might be that while the men of the camp had\r\nbeen intent on following Soosie's tracks, the women and children had\r\nstraggled after as if the quest was of no special concern to them.\r\n\r\nIn the broken country well in to the base of the mountain all traces of\r\nthe exodus was lost, though bush instinct, supplemented by the actions\r\nof the dogs, gave sense of its direction. Blundering down into a ravine\r\nwhere blanched vegetation betokened complete seclusion from the sun, we\r\nclambered up the opposing steep emerging from an entanglement of jungle\r\non a high and open ridge which commanded an unimpeded view to the\r\nwest--a scene of theatrical clarity with a single theatrical smear. From\r\na hollow far below slothful smoke filtered through the matted,\r\nsombre, dew-bespangled foliage, rose a few feet, and drifted abruptly,\r\ndissolving from diaphanous blue to nothingness. The resonant whooping\r\nof a swamp pheasant, antiphonal to a bell-voiced, crimson-crowned fruit\r\npigeon in a giant fig-tree, the screeches of a sulphur-crested cockatoo\r\nas it tumbled in the air, evading the swoops of a grey goshawk,\r\nmaterialised the peace and the conflicts of a scene upon which no man\r\nhad made mark.\r\n\r\nThe phantom trail of smoke betrayed the resting-place of the fugitives,\r\nthough all tracks on the uneasy earth had failed. Odours of the jungle\r\nsoothed my mind, contradicted the transaction of any unholy orgy, and\r\ngave assurance that the men had unravelled Soosie's wanderings until she\r\nhad begun to ascend the mountain, and that, being then on strange and\r\nterrifying ground, they had abandoned the search, returning to familiar\r\nlevel country free from the excursions of dreaded spirits.\r\n\r\nWith light hearts we descended the ridge, and, plunging again into the\r\ndimness of the jungle, struck as direct a route as possible for the\r\nsmoke-revealed camp. Crossing a narrow creek, we peered silently through\r\nthe screen of ferns and banana plants, where in a secluded glade were\r\nthe wanderers in happy festival.\r\n\r\nCould any scene approach nearer the ideal? Men, women and children,\r\nmostly unclad, talking and laughing in modulated tones, while amusing\r\nthemselves with trivial occupations and eating convenient food in the\r\ndepths of the jungle, sanctified by distance and scene and sound! Peace\r\nsmiled, propriety approved. They ate of the fruits of the earth. The\r\nfern-embowered stream gave them to drink. No sign of the white man, with\r\nhis interfering and desolating ways, assailed the sight. It was as if\r\nthe mist of centuries had lifted, and for once time-soiled mortals were\r\npermitted to gaze on a Garden of Eden free from danger and innocent of\r\nsin. There was none here to make the quiet folk afraid or discontented.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped out, the scene changed with pantomimic celerity. We were in\r\nthe midst of a community of excitable and resentful people, who, viewing\r\nus, if not with active hostility, at least with surprise and anger,\r\nseemed embarrassed by guilty knowledge. None of the customary greetings\r\nwelcomed us. None offered other than scowls.\r\n\r\n“Where Soosie?” I demanded in authoritative tones of a boy accustomed to\r\ntreat my slightest word with respect.\r\n\r\nWith averted face he sullenly said: “That fella Tchoosie he run away. He\r\ngo l-o-n-g way, alonga mountain!”\r\n\r\n“Look here! You no humbug. Where Soosie sit down? Plenty row along\r\nwhite man suppose Soosie no come back. That fella Soosie belonga Missis.\r\nMissis very sorry. She bin make'm Soosie all asame white Mary.”\r\n\r\nStill the face-averting boy reiterated: “That fella Soosie he bin go\r\nlong way--more far. You fella make'm Soosie no good.”\r\n\r\nOthers gathered round. Several carried weapons--nulla-nullas and wooden\r\nswords--and assumed hostile attitudes.\r\n\r\nDan became uncontrollably excited, storming for the production of\r\nSoosie, and being met with inconclusive statements and evasions. Being\r\none who knew no fear, who deemed his questions justifiable, who felt\r\nhimself more than a match for the whole camp, and was convinced that the\r\nblacks were in possession of essential information, he urged the policy\r\nof chastising the sullenness out of a couple of incommunicative boys.\r\nHis attitude, and mine, hitherto, towards the blacks had been of cheery\r\ngood-nature tempered with considerate authority. Present moroseness was\r\nnovel, and he was eager to sweep it away with a sturdy stick, and thus\r\nto demonstrate that when a friendly white man visited a camp blacks\r\nshould be deferential and alert to assist his mission.\r\n\r\nIn the mood of the men tragedy was inevitable unless both of us kept\r\ncool. What would be the ending of a fray between two white men and\r\nmany armed blacks, some of whom were aching under a prolonged, however\r\ninconsequent, grievance against a white family?\r\n\r\n“Look here, Dan. Leave those fellows alone,” I said firmly but quietly.\r\n“There'll be sorrow for some if you begin a row.”\r\n\r\n“I don't care for a hundred blacks! I'd kick myself if I could not floor\r\nhalf a dozen single-handed! Where that Soosie?”\r\n\r\nTo distract attention from Dan, I moved off a few yards.\r\n\r\n“What you ki-ki?” I asked of Wethera, who gnawed with concentrated\r\nsatisfaction at a charred bone. “You ki-ki wallaby?”\r\n\r\n“No wallaby! This one 'mandee' (hand) belonga Tchoosie!”\r\n\r\nScorched flesh and blackened bone had left their smear on the face of\r\nthe kindest cannibal of them all. On the fire was a foot with\r\ncharred ankle-bones; in a dilly-bag other fragments, but in Wethera's\r\ncountenance no consciousness of evil-doing.\r\n\r\n“Come here!” I shouted.\r\n\r\nThe excited man strode to the spot.\r\n\r\n“Soosie,” I said, in the calmest tones I could command, “has been\r\nmurdered. This is a cannibal feast!”\r\n\r\nWith a bound he upset the gin, who shrieked as she grovelled in the\r\nembers.\r\n\r\n“You wretches! You kill Soosie! I kill you!”\r\n\r\nAs he drew his revolver from his belt I seized his hand, and,\r\nrestraining him as best I could for a moment, spoke authoritative and\r\nsoothing words, and led him away weak and tremulous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot for many months--long after Dan had left the district--did exact\r\ninformation as to the fate of the hapless girl reach our ears. Wethera\r\ntold of the tragedy. Duckbill had followed her tracks from the house\r\ntowards the mountain, had overtaken her, and, since she had fought\r\nfrenziedly, had “killed her alonga head little bit,” not intending to\r\nkill her “dead, finis.” Carried to the camp, it had been found out that\r\nshe was actually dead. Then all had become stricken and run away.\r\n\r\nBy her obstinacy Soosie had offended tribal law. She had suffered. In\r\nthe necessitous jungle animal food is never wasted, be it beast, bird,\r\nor reptile.\r\n\r\nIt had been an edifying sacrament, too, founded on immemorial truth,\r\nfor had it not been devoutly believed that Soosie's most excellent and\r\npotent personality would remain with and glorify every participant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE SHIRT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“A strong, untutored intellect, eyesight, heart; a strong, wild\r\nMan.”--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago, when hardy and adventurous men made laws unto\r\nthemselves, and their somewhat hasty and inconsiderate hands began to\r\nsting the aboriginal population, there lived on this Isle a stalwart\r\nnative whose force of character constituted him a captain among his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nPossibly he was Tom's father. Before he passed away, Tom had often told\r\nthat his father was king of this realm and a man of parts. He it was\r\nwho harpooned a huge green turtle to the east. The game was so\r\nextraordinarily strong that others hastened to his aid, for the capture\r\nwas beyond the capabilities of one man kneeling in a tucked-up sheet of\r\nbark. The whole fleet of canoes barely succeeded in towing the massive\r\nand reluctant creature to the nearest beach, and Tom was wont to\r\ntell that it took eight strong men to turn it on its back. It was\r\n“kummaoried” on the sand, and Tom oft pointed out the very spot as proof\r\nof the most famous feast within the range of tradition.\r\n\r\nLet it be accepted, then, that Blue Shirt was Tom's father, since\r\nhistory is silent on the point, and none is left to question or\r\nauthenticate it. He was a big man, and his son was like him. He was\r\nfond of colours; so, too, was his son. He was a fighter; his son's\r\nmeritorious scars proved him worthy of his blood. He was a man in\r\nauthority and full of territorial pride; his son's dominance was\r\nundoubted, for did he not chide the “big fella gubbermen” on its\r\naudacity in disposing of his Island--his country--even to a friendly\r\nwhite man?\r\n\r\nBlue Shirt was the ruler and lawgiver of this Island when a barque\r\nstrove with a cyclone which eventually shattered her to pieces and\r\nscattered her cargo of cedar-logs to the four winds. After the wreck a\r\nboat put out from a not distant port on a beach-combing cruise. The boat\r\nwas known as the CAPTAIN COOK. About a hundred years before her namesake\r\nhad reported that he had seen about thirty natives, all unclad, on an\r\nadjacent islet. With the captain was his mate, two other white men, a\r\nblack boy, and a young gin. Many derelict logs were seen and certain\r\nwreckage, which made the boat's company inclined to the belief that some\r\nof the castaways might have landed on Dunk Island. They steered hither,\r\nanchoring in the evening.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning three stalwart black boys put off in canoes to\r\nthe CAPTAIN COOK, and, making friendly demonstrations, were invited on\r\nboard. Food was given them, and to the leader the captain presented a\r\nblue shirt. No dweller of the Island had ever before possessed such a\r\nsumptuous and glorious garment. Indeed, if the absolute truth must\r\nbe told, no dweller had dreamt of anything more desirable than an\r\ninadequate cloak laboriously wrought from the inner bark of a fig-tree,\r\nraiment sanctioned by the first of fashions.\r\n\r\nHaving made it known that they belonged to a neighbouring islet at the\r\nmoment unfriendly to the overbearing Dunk Island tribe, Blue Shirt and\r\nhis attendants mentioned that cedar-logs and other attractive flotsam\r\nbestrewed the beaches, and volunteered to conduct the strangers to the\r\nbest places on the understanding that they, being alien and hostile,\r\nshould remain under the protection of the rifle-carrying white men.\r\n\r\nThe captain, two men, and the black boy, followed Blue Shirt ashore;\r\nbut, although he was conspicuously clad, could not find him or any other\r\nman. A few old and casual women represented the hospitable inhabitants,\r\nwhile Sabbath quietude brooded over the scene as they strolled along the\r\nyellow beach. By chance one of the party glanced towards the spot where\r\nthey had landed, and saw half a dozen vigorous gins endeavouring to haul\r\nthe boat above tideway.\r\n\r\nHow excellent the strategy!\r\n\r\nThe designing but faint-hearted women fled when the white men charged\r\nfor the boat, which now was seen to be endowed with an incredible,\r\nuncanny rocking movement of its own. Looking beneath, they saw a huge\r\ncripple straining himself, Atlas-like, to heave it over. In spite of\r\ninferior legs, his brawny shoulders had almost accomplished the feat\r\nwhen he was unceremoniously interrupted. While he sprawled away, a mob\r\nof blacks rushed suddenly from the cover of some rocks, the leader\r\nof the assailants being Blue Shirt, who had painted his unclad parts\r\nmartial red and white. The strength of the party was guessed at thirty.\r\nAn exact census was not taken, for with spears and nulla-nullas and big\r\nswords, each warrior having the protection of a shield, the treacherous\r\nband swept on the deluded guests of their leader, whose hostile yells\r\nscandalised the meek phrases and friendly signs of a short hour before.\r\n\r\nThe captain, poor, outwitted man, had laid his rifle beside the boat.\r\nIt was too late now to bring it into decisive action. Keeping close\r\ntogether, the defenders warded off the first rush with whatever came\r\nto hand. The rifle was recovered; but Blue Shirt, recognising that it\r\nrepresented victory, struggled for it determinedly. A spear was thrown\r\nat close quarters straight for the captain's neck, but one of the men\r\ndeftly twitched it off, a feat that so enraged the warriors that they\r\nmade him their special target, until at last one of their spears pierced\r\nhis hand. Being rough and thready, the black palm-point made an ugly\r\nwound; but the resolute man drew it out, and, breaking the spear in\r\ntwain, threw it into the boat, and as he did so, another grazed his\r\nabdomen. While he was thus defending himself against the spears and\r\nnulla-nullas of outrageous fortune, the captain made wide, sweeping\r\nmovements with the butt of his rifle, and the other man and the boy, the\r\nboat being by this time afloat, tugged at the oars. The attacking party\r\nfollowed, the captain making good misuse of the rifle, the odd man and\r\nthe boy occasionally perverting an oar to wrongful but, at the crisis,\r\neffective purpose, while the wounded suffered the hate of him who earns\r\npersonal as well as racial animosity. He sustained a cut on the head\r\nfrom a wooden sword, yet he fought on, retaining his wits, while a\r\nkind Providence, and his own artfulness and agility protected him from\r\nhurtling spears.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the little excursion was paid in wounds and bruises and,\r\neventually, putrefying sores, while the souls of all instantly mortified\r\nunder the sight of triumphant Blue Shirt jeering and gesticulating as\r\nonly an uncouth black dare, as he waved over his head a tomahawk he had\r\nabstracted from the boat during the morning's pleasant entertainment.\r\n\r\nNo one of the poor, depraved representatives of the race has any\r\nknowledge of the event in which Blue Shirt showed himself to be a\r\nsuccessful plotter, a bold strategist, an original tactician, and a\r\nbrave fighter. His son is dust. His grandson, though true in complexion,\r\nknows more about engines than he does of wooden swords and how to use\r\nthem. The zest of life was with his ancestor, who during a long life had\r\nbut one shirt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORGOTTEN DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Of lonely folk cut off unseen.”\r\n\r\n                          HOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months ago chance bestowed the opportunity of listening to the\r\nconversation of one who for very many yearn has hung upon the skirts of\r\ncivilisation. A bushman of rare resourcefulness, wide knowledge of the\r\ndry as well as the moist parts of North Queensland, a reader, and\r\nan acute and accurate observer of natural phenomena, he has often\r\nentertained me with the relation of episodes in his career which, though\r\nquite unsensational, is of the material of which the history of the\r\nbush must be compiled. He is now settled on a tidal creek, his nearest\r\nneighbours miles away. Independent of the regular assistance of\r\nblacks in the cultivation of his land, he is one of those who, while\r\nacknowledging no such thing as comradeship, and who, true to his\r\nsentiments, keeps them at arm's-length, has, albeit, acquired\r\nconfidences rather unusual.\r\n\r\nWhen his reading matter has become exhausted, he has sat night after\r\nnight for months together absorbing the lore of the camp. To him has\r\nbeen disclosed many a well-guarded secret. Not unto every man who asks\r\ndo the blacks tell their thoughts or impart their legends. You may study\r\nthem; but they, too, are discreet students, who often keep their counsel\r\nwhile seeming to comply with your anxiety to learn of their ways and be\r\nwise as they are wise.\r\n\r\nMy friend is one of those undemonstrative, self-contained men in whom\r\nsome of the coloured, cautious metaphysicians find a congenial\r\nsoul. Therefore is he a compendium of much out-of-the-way and covert\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAs we talked on the subject of the unexplained disappearances of men in\r\nthe bush of Australia, he told the incidents of the forgotten dead to\r\nwhich these writings have special reference. I use my own words, so do\r\nnot bind myself to historic exactness.\r\n\r\nHe had been away earning his own living, for his estate, fruitful as it\r\nis, did not then quite provide for his sustenance, markets being\r\ndistant and far from consistent. Returning, he found the blacks who had\r\nassociated themselves with his humble establishment had in the interval\r\nsought change of scene. The land that he called his had belonged\r\nto their ancestors centuries before Cook tied the ENDEAVOUR to that\r\ndisputed and historic tree, and was theirs when he had first intruded.\r\nHis hut, his horses, his implements, were much as he had left them. The\r\ncamping-place of the blacks appeared to have been unoccupied for some\r\ntime. Such was in accordance with usual happenings. Going about his\r\nlonesome work, he reflected that his dusky acquaintances would return\r\nin their own good time, and being a man of mental resource, the solitude\r\nwas by no means irksome.\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight they appeared unceremoniously, and, taking casual\r\npart in the ordinary work, the affairs of the isolated estate went on as\r\nsmoothly as before. There was a stranger in the camp, a middle-aged man,\r\ntimorous, and knowing little of the ways of white men. Of him scarcely\r\nany notice was taken. Yet in a few weeks it was evident that the\r\nstranger was determined to make himself pleasant. Accordingly, the white\r\nman refrained from advances, while for the love of mental exhilaration\r\nhe pondered: “That boy wants to tell me something. He shall tell me all\r\nhe wants to in his own way, while I will play the part of an indifferent\r\nauditor.”\r\n\r\nThat the stranger had some secret on his soul was apparent. My friend\r\nresolved to receive that secret in the spirit of gracious condescension.\r\nSo played he his part, and line upon line, here a little and there a\r\nlittle, the story was told.\r\n\r\nFew of the tribe of the stranger had ever seen a white man. None\r\nhad ever visited the coast. All were myalls, living naked among the\r\nmountains in gorges gloomy with jungle, and but rarely hunting on the\r\nfoothills. One day consternation and curiosity spread through the camp.\r\nThree strange men with yellow faces and short black hair had been seen.\r\nThey carried nothing in their hands, and seemed frightened. Thus the\r\nnervous couriers of the camp spoke.\r\n\r\nNext morning the men took up the tracks, and, sneaking close up,\r\nfollowed, alert and unseen, the unsuspecting visitors to their country.\r\n\r\nBewildered in the jungle, the queer-looking men wandered aimlessly,\r\nmoaning and wailing. They were lost. Suddenly the blacks appeared.\r\nTwo of the strangers, glad of the company of any sort of human beings,\r\nsmiled and gesticulated pleasantly, making it plain that they were\r\nhungry, tired, and frightened, and, longing to get back to the coast,\r\nwould bestow upon their guides unheard-of blessings for safe-conduct\r\nthither. Strangely, the black men accepted the trust. Four each took\r\na hand of the confiding strangers, and, pointing ahead and chattering,\r\ninduced them to walk quickly in a direction in which by signs they\r\nindicated the dwelling of a white man.\r\n\r\nThe third wanderer had run away, blundering through the jungle, and the\r\nblacks had refrained from following him. Nodding gaily and jabbering\r\nvolubly, but with mutual intelligibility, hosts and guests paced along a\r\nnarrow track, each of the latter personally and firmly conducted by\r\ntwo of his newly found and most attentive friends. Others of the tribe,\r\n“like frightful fiends, did close beside them tread”; and while the\r\nescorts lured the yellow men with comforting pantomime, the frightful\r\nfiends fell on them suddenly with great wooden swords, killing them\r\noff-hand and on the very verge of the camp.\r\n\r\nWillingly hurrying to the place of execution, the murdered men had saved\r\nthe calculating blacks the trouble of carrying their carcasses.\r\n\r\nThen four went back for the nervous escapee. He was safe, for the tracks\r\nwere as obvious to them as a plough furrow to a European. Crouching\r\nbeside a fallen, decaying tree, where bird's-nest ferns grew\r\noutrageously gross, they found him; and they jeered. He screamed and\r\nshouted in unknown tongue, while the brisk, stubby hair of his head\r\nstood on end. (My friend's hair-brush was alluded to in graphic\r\nillustration.) They struck him down, and, smashing in his head and\r\nseizing arms and legs, jogged back to the camp.\r\n\r\nAnd the festival lasted many days, though plenty made gluttons of them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe forgotten dead were Javanese--deserters from a sugar-plantation; for\r\nthe tragedy happened long ago, when labour was being drawn from Java\r\nand other oversupplied countries. Desertions were not uncommon, for the\r\nsanguine men of the equator endure with less philosophy than others that\r\nsickness of the heart which comes from love of one's native land when\r\nabsent from it.\r\n\r\nFrom Java's seething millions were the nostalgic three ever missed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEAGLES-NEST FLOAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.”\r\n\r\n                                              ROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who study primitive races, applying their wisdom and learning to\r\nthe investigation of the origin of domestic and other implements and\r\ncontrivances, inform us that the first boat was probably a log, on which\r\nthe man sat astride, using a stick as a means of propulsion. In time the\r\nidea of hollowing the log occurred, Nature undoubtedly presenting\r\nthe model and inviting the novice to squat inside. But what was the\r\ninhabitant of a certain island in the Gulf of Carpentaria to do since\r\nNature failed to provide a tree big enough to possess the degree of\r\nbuoyancy necessary for his frail frame, when he wished to cross the\r\nnarrow channel separating him from a lesser island where turtle are\r\nplentiful and unsuspicious?\r\n\r\nBeing in status something above a wallaby--the largest animal other than\r\nhimself of his native land which, when hunted, occasionally swam towards\r\nthe opposite shore, he constructed one or other of two rafts or floats,\r\nboth derivable from Nature's models. One was in the form of an eagle's\r\nnest, and not nearly so large as that in which some eaglets are reared,\r\nmade by interlacing branchlets of white mangrove until the mass was\r\nsufficient to support his weight. With a double ended paddle rudely\r\nshaped from the thin buttress roots of the red mangrove, and comic in\r\nthe crudeness and disproportion of its parts, he felt himself safe\r\nmiles out to sea. When he approached a passing vessel he presented the\r\nillusion, not of walking, but of sitting on the water, for the float\r\nwas almost completely submerged. If it became necessary for his wife to\r\nattend him on his marine excursions, she was towed behind, and used her\r\nown pedal power. Possibly this primitive raft is the pathetic expression\r\nof man's first struggle against the restrictions of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe other resource of the boatless islander was another description of\r\nfloat, also retrogressive from the log; the idea not transmitted to\r\nhim by any high-minded bird, but forced upon his attention by elemental\r\nstrife. He would have seen that the wind and the waves occasionally\r\ntore from his beaches Pandanus palms, and that the matted, fibrous roots\r\nthereof floated. Pondering in his dim way, and being sadly an hungered\r\nand aware that fat and lazy turtle were basking in the sighed-for\r\nshallows, he took a bundle of buoyant roots and light sticks and lashed\r\nit securely at one end with strips of bark. He then spread out the other\r\nend until it took the shape of a fan, and weaved the strands loosely\r\ntogether with beach trailers. His raft was complete. At least this\r\ndescription applies to that in use to-day, which represents the highest\r\nstage to which the design has been brought.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the peril-ignoring hunger, the hunter sat on\r\nthe float with legs extended frontally. Across his thighs crouched\r\nhis favourite dog, and behind him, her thin shanks outside his and her\r\nskinny arms round his slim waist, sat, uncomfortable, his cowed wife--a\r\nnecessary part of his equipment. Can he be imagined half turning to his\r\ndeferential spouse, and saying: “My dear, in the words of Shakespeare,\r\n\r\n    “On such a full sea are we now afloat\r\n    And we must take the current when it serves\r\n    Or lose our'--turtle”?\r\n\r\nIs it not edifying, too, to reflect that the timid man, encouraged\r\nby the object-lessons of Nature, given in pity of his simplicity, had\r\ncontrived the only rafts the resources of his island made possible?\r\nAnd does not the fact that he had courage to cross the estranging deep\r\nthereon give graphic proof of the inhospitality of his native soil?\r\n\r\nFlat and generally of sad aspect, the country of the raftsman lies\r\nremote and uncommended. The scented sandalwood is there, dwarfed,\r\nattenuated, worthless. The most fragrant of the Pandanus palms is\r\nplentiful, the fruit forming the chief part of the vegetable diet of the\r\nlean and stunted inhabitants, who find difficulty in fashioning weapons\r\nwith which to obtain fish and turtle, the land failing to supply\r\nstraight sticks of the length needed for spears. Each has to be spliced.\r\nThe islands are expressed in the race they sustain--possibly the lowest\r\nof Australian types. Does it not bespeak much to the credit of men\r\nand women who have been used to the cities where the advantages of\r\ncivilisation are at command and its comforts available, that they should\r\nabandon the society of kin and friends and isolate themselves in a drear\r\nand unfriendly tract for the sake of a few coloured folk whose mental\r\ncapacities are feeble and whose habits are shockingly disgusting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE IN RETALIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Red in tooth and claw.”\r\n\r\n               TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a mangrove creek a shoal of barramundi had been bombed with dynamite.\r\nImmediately after the explosion the white onlookers as well as the\r\nblacks dived off-hand into the stream to secure the helpless fish. One\r\nof the party seized a weighty and unconscious victim of the outrage, and\r\nto retain it thrust his fist through the gills and found himself unable\r\nto withdraw, and when the fish began to revive he realised that he was\r\nnot master. With a supreme effort he did manage to get his head above\r\nwater to gulp a mouthful of air, but the gallant fish promptly exerted\r\nitself, and a deadly struggle took place on the muddy bottom. Once more\r\nthe fish was tugged to the surface, only to dive just as the man became\r\nconscious of the applause of the interested spectators. When they came\r\nto the surface again ill luck on the part of the fish had brought it\r\ninto the shallows caused by a ridge of rocks, and the man hauled his\r\nprize ashore, frankly acknowledging that the happy chance of the rocks\r\nand not his own wits and strength had given the victory into his hands.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion heartless dynamite was used in a creek, where had\r\nassembled many blacks, who scrambled riotously in the muddy water for\r\nthe spoil, among which were several huge crabs, some dismembered by the\r\nforce of the explosion, some stunned, some merely agitated. Dilly Boy,\r\nthe biggest and the greediest of the crowd, acquired several fish and\r\nthree or four crabs, the largest of the latter of which seemed sound\r\nasleep. The dynamite had ministered an anodyne from which, apparently,\r\nthere would be no awakening. It the boy disregarded, while he secured\r\nthose which were more or less active. Busily engaged, he was not aware\r\nthat a crab when he seems asleep may be merely plotting. This hero was\r\nhatching out a scheme whereby it might be revenged for the outrage.\r\nIt watched and deliberated, and as the boy sat down grabbed him with\r\nponderous and toothed pinchers on that part of the body which is said to\r\nbe most susceptible to insult. The boy rose. Not half a plug of\r\ndynamite could have given more hearty impulse, not all the clamour of a\r\ncorroboree equal his yell of surprise and anguish. He capered. The crab,\r\nwhich had not speculated on the caper, and to avert summary divorce,\r\nlocked its claws, now guaranteed to hold to death and beyond it--to\r\ndestruction. Astounded--indeed, petrified--by the high antics of the\r\nboy, none of the spectators could venture to his aid. They were fully\r\nengaged with unrestrained and joyful hysteria. The more the boy\r\nyelled and cavorted, the more frantic the fun. Blood trickled down the\r\nchocolate-coloured skin, but the valiant crab held on. It was there for\r\na definite purpose. The hour and the crab had arrived. Vengeance for\r\ncenturies of wrongs to the race and heroic self-sacrifice animated brain\r\nand inspired the claw with the dynamics of ten; while the afflicted\r\nvictim imagined--he had no mirror to hold up to Nature--that he was the\r\nsport of a lusty crocodile.\r\n\r\nAmidst his shrieks he commanded the ministration of his wife. She ran\r\nto meet him with a waddy. True to the limitations of her sex, though her\r\nintentions were admirable and dutiful, the result was disastrous. The\r\nboy got a paralysing blow on the small of the back, and flopped down. Up\r\njumped Dilly Boy, and the gin raced after him, murderously inclined\r\nto the crab. Half her blows were misses and the other half seriously\r\nembarrassed her husband, as his tumbles testified. She belaboured him\r\nimpartially and with perverted goodwill from shoulder to heel, for she\r\naimed invariably at the crab, and where is the woman who ever hit where\r\nshe designed? The crab was merely tickling; the faithful spouse, with\r\nthe tenderest motives, was cruelly beating her lord and master to\r\ndisablement, and it can scarcely be credited that the echo of his\r\nremarks has yet subsided. In his fervour the boy made an exceptionally\r\nvicious threat against the gin, and in response she missed him and hit\r\nthe crab. Under such forceful compulsion the crab parted with its claw.\r\nIt was ponderous and toothed, be it remembered, and well and truly\r\nlocked, and retained its grip. The target being smaller, the aims of\r\nthe gin went more and more astray. The back of the boy, owing to the\r\nincessant misses of the waddy, changed from brown to purple, and a red\r\nribbon wavered down his thigh. Still he ran, and the devoted gin coursed\r\nafter him with the energy of a half-back, the fury of a disappointed\r\npolitician, and the riot of three-dozen cockatoos scared from a\r\ncorn-field. Almost worn out, the boy sprang round, and, seizing the\r\nwaddy, began to chastise the gin, whose screams blended with his\r\nunwholesome threats. But the claws held on--not like grim death; they\r\nwere grim death. Every second blow was directed aft--one blow forward,\r\nwhich generally severely disagreed with the gin; one blow astern, which\r\nafforded neither mental relief nor physical comfort. The gin fled from\r\nthe infuriated boy; the boy from the fearsome relic of the crab, and\r\ncalled louder as he ran. When in full flight, the gin tripped over a\r\nmangrove root, and, spread-eagled, fell. The boy came tumbling after,\r\nbut the remnants of the crab--the bony bud of a tail--stood erect and\r\nfirm. Then the pitying spectators seized Dilly Boy, and, holding\r\nhim, unlocked the pinchers. He rolled over--it was the only easeful\r\nattitude--as he cursed all gins, crabs, and dynamiters with wondrous\r\nfluency. And may the potency of those coloured curses rest upon the\r\nlatter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“STAR RUN ABOUT”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        “It is the stars,\r\n    The stars above us, govern our conditions.”\r\n\r\n                                   SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimitive folk have ever looked up to the heavens for signs of good and\r\nill. Celestial appearances have fought for them terrestrial battles, or\r\nhave weakened their arms by prognostications of impending disaster.\r\n\r\nAppeals have been made to passionless planets for justice against\r\nmundane decrees, and when coincidences have been favourable the devout\r\nstudent of the skies has loudly proclaimed them as proof of supernatural\r\ninterest in trivial, transient occurrences. In accordance with the\r\ndegree of poetry in the fibre of the people, so, in a certain degree,\r\nhas the belief in stellar influence been manifest.\r\n\r\nThe blacks of North Queensland, being, possibly, the least of the races\r\nin a poetic sense, have but slight regard for the interference of the\r\nstars in their poor little affairs, and in this respect are saner than\r\nmany a nation which has given abundant proof of wisdom. One of their\r\nbeliefs is that meteors are baleful, though under given conditions they\r\nderive from such phenomena longed-for assurance. A meteor is described\r\nas “Star run about.” “That fella no good; him kill'em man!” Yet in\r\ncircumstances to be mentioned they find in a meteor a sign that life has\r\nbeen restored to an individual whom they have done to death. It is the\r\nopinion of men who have studied the customs of the blacks that they--and\r\nto their honour be it said--were never among themselves premeditated,\r\ngluttonous cannibals. Human flesh was eaten, if not with solemnity, at\r\nleast with ceremony, for the belief exists to this day that the moral\r\nand physical excellencies of the victim are assimilated by those who\r\npartake of his flesh.\r\n\r\nReincarnation is prompt and practical, and unaccompanied by wasteful\r\nand delusive hope. Herein lies the explanation of many a deliberate and\r\nconfessed killing, while to the meteor have the perpetrators looked for\r\nabsolution and remission of their sin. That which in the eyes of the\r\nwhite man is regarded as an atrocious murder has not been, in their\r\nsemi-religious code, in any sense criminal, but a rite from which many\r\nif not all the camp must inevitably benefit.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the killing of a boy is the highest compliment which may\r\nbe paid him, for it is proof that he has personal qualities which are\r\nthe envy and admiration of others, and for general welfare should be\r\nshared by all. The boy who so dies is an unconscious patriot. This is\r\nproved sufficiently by the fact that only what are considered to be\r\nthe more vitalising portions of the boy's body are eaten, whereas if\r\ngluttony were the impulse of the deed the whole of the body would be\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nAn illustrative incident has been told me by one who has gained the\r\nconfidence of the blacks, and to whom other facts connected with it were\r\npersonally known. Not many years ago a boy from from a distant locality\r\nvisited a certain district in company with his master. He was tall, well\r\nfavoured, a good rider, quite an athlete, an accomplished performer with\r\nthe mouth-organ and concertina; ready and persuasive of tongue. These\r\nqualities provoked unaffected admiration; for the natives of the place\r\nare undersized, ill-looking, and deficient generally in the arts of\r\npleasing. Before the master left, Caesar was persuaded by his envious\r\nfellow-countrymen to remain with them to be flattered and courted.\r\n\r\nTo evade trouble, the whole camp took to the hills for a while. In the\r\nmeantime Caesar's master departed, thinking, no doubt, that the boy\r\nwould follow him to his own “more better country.” After several weeks\r\nthe local blacks returned, but Caesar was not of the party, and it did\r\nnot occur to any of the white residents to ask questions concerning\r\nhim. In accordance with the love of notoriety which affects humanity\r\nirrespective of complexion, one of the boys began to boast of being as\r\ngood as Caesar, and to prove his contentions by aping the manners of his\r\nabsent friend. It was not long before he blurted out the secret by which\r\nhe had become superfine--he had participated with others in a cannibal\r\nrite after Caesar had been good-naturedly killed.\r\n\r\nRumours of the tragedy came to the ears of the police. The ringleaders\r\nof the assassins were arrested, and one at least endured a term of\r\nimprisonment as punishment. Caesar had been lured away and killed\r\nbecause he was a good fellow and strong, and because his murderers\r\nwanted to be good and strong like him. Certain parts of his body were\r\neaten, without relish, but with fervent hope. A remarkable circumstance\r\nin connection with the sacrifice and ceremonial rite for the general\r\nwelfare is that the perpetrators console and comfort themselves with the\r\nbelief that should a meteor appear it is a sign that the victim did not\r\nactually die, or if he died under their hands, that he has come to life\r\nagain. Those who were concerned in the killing and who had partaken of\r\nthe flesh sat together for several evenings gazing with expectation into\r\nthe sky. A meteor flashed across it, and it was hailed as a sign that\r\nCaesar was alive and had gone to his own country. The contrary\r\nevidence of relics of the dead was waved away before the imperious and\r\ndisinterested testimony of the falling star. “No matter. That fella him\r\nno dead--finish. Him walk about 'nother country. Him good fella. That\r\nfella star run about bin tell 'em.”\r\n\r\nThey felt themselves to have benefited materially and spiritually by\r\nparticipation in the rite, and were calm in their belief that the victim\r\nwas none the worse for the temporary misfortune from which he suffered.\r\n\r\nIn another locality a meteor signifies the death of an individual,\r\nand is referred to as “Tee-go-binah.” When a death cannot be directly\r\nattributed to it locally, the phenomenon is referred to with such rustic\r\nlogic as this: “Some fella dead alonga 'nother camp. Might be longa\r\nway.” The ancients felt “the sweet influences of the Pleiades.” One\r\nof the two intimacies of the blacks of North Queensland with\r\nstellar phenomena which has come to my knowledge is associated with\r\nreincarnation after a deed of blood. Their faith is as absolute,\r\nperhaps, as was that of the men of old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKS AS FISHERMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“For I tell you, scholar, fishing is an art, or at least it is an art to\r\ncatch fish.”--IZAAK WALTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of North Queensland evidence may still be obtained,\r\nthough it ever becomes more difficult to secure practical demonstration,\r\nof several novel methods of killing fish in vogue among the blacks prior\r\nto the advent of civilisation. In many parts, indeed, the presence of\r\nthe white man has swept away not only the use of decent, if trivial,\r\npursuits and handicrafts, but the knowledge also that they ever existed.\r\n\r\nThe few facts here presented are, with some slight reservations, drawn\r\nfrom actual observation. No doubt the well-informed on such subjects\r\nwill have plenary reasons--if ever these lines are honoured by perusal\r\nof the class--for the accusation that there is nothing in them having\r\nthe virtue of newness or novelty. But I am not a professor with a mind\r\nlike a warehouse, rich with the spoils of time, but a mere peddler,\r\nconscious of the janglings of an ill-sorted, ill-packed knapsack of\r\nunconsidered trifles.\r\n\r\nSome pioneers know more about the acts of the past than the best\r\ninformed of the younger blacks, who look with wonder and unconstrained\r\ndoubt when shown articles similar to those which their grandfathers must\r\nhave used almost every day.\r\n\r\nThough the blacks of the past had but casual knowledge of the cruel\r\nlittle barb that the resourceful white fisherman finds essential to\r\nsport, and had neither neat tackle, nor reels, nor creels; though they\r\nwere denied the solace of tobacco, and every other accessory, they were\r\nadepts at fishing. They had at command a stock of accumulated lore so\r\ngraphically transmitted that the babe and suckling must have seemed to\r\nacquire it almost intuitively. They knew much of the habits of fish.\r\nTheir methods of laying under tribute the harvest of the sea were\r\nso varied and unconventional that when one expedient failed, others,\r\nequally free from the ethics of sport, were available at the shortest\r\nnotice. Fishing was not a pastime, but a serious occupation in which\r\nnearly everyone was proficient.\r\n\r\nTimes are changing; but still the mouths of smaller creeks are sometimes\r\ndammed, save for certain sluices and by-washes where puzzling pockets\r\nare set. Weirs formed by stakes driven into the sand and interwoven with\r\ntwigs guide incoming fish into ingenious traps, whence they are scooped\r\nup in dilly-bags. Occasionally the whole camp, dogs and piccaninnies\r\nincluded, take part in a raid upon the sea. Men in deeper water, women\r\nand boys and girls forming wings at right angles to the beach, enclose\r\na prescribed area in the ever shifting, mobile fence. Certain of the men\r\nhave huge dilly-bags made of strips of lawyer-cane, and shaped like a\r\nninepin with a funnel for a head. The tactics of the party combine to\r\ndrive the fish towards the silent men having charge of the dilly-bags,\r\nwho manipulate what certainly has the appearance of being a very awkward\r\nutensil in the water with great skill and alertness. Hurried to frenzy\r\nby the shouting and splashing of the crowd, and the flurrying of the\r\nsurface with bushes, the fish dart hither and thither until most of them\r\nhave found their way into the bags, at the only spots where, for the\r\ntime being, peace and quietude prevail. At other times a somewhat\r\nsimilar design of basket is used for trapping eels.\r\n\r\nMen armed with spears surround and exterminate a shoal detected in\r\nshallow water; and the boomerang and the nulla-nulla as well as the\r\nspear form the weapons of the solitary fisherman. On one of the islands\r\nof the Gulf of Carpentaria the boomerang (I am told) alone is used, the\r\nblacks being so expert that little is left to chance.\r\n\r\nThough the wommera, or, as it is known locally, the yellamun, is common\r\nin the neighbourhood of Dunk Island, it is not employed as an accessory\r\nin the spearing of fish. Further north it is so almost universally, a\r\ncombination of boomerang and wommera being the most popular form. This\r\ndual-purpose weapon is merely a boomerang to one of the ends of which is\r\nfitted a spur, which engages the socket in the butt of the spear. While\r\non this subject, it is interesting to note that, though the common form\r\nof the implement for increasing the velocity and range of the spear\r\nis generally considered to be peculiar to Australia, its principle is\r\nembodied in a contrivance which was used for a similar purpose in the\r\nNew Hebrides in Captain Cook's day.\r\n\r\nDescribing some of the arts of the inhabitants of Tanna, Cook (“Voyages\r\nof Captain Cook round the World,” vol. i., chapter vi.) says that in\r\nthe throwing of darts “they make use of the becket, that is, a piece of\r\nstiff plaited cord, about six inches long, with an eye in one end and a\r\nknot in the other. The eye is fixed on the forefinger of the right hand,\r\nand the other end is hitched round the dart where it is nearly on\r\nan equipoise. They hold the dart between the thumb and the remaining\r\nfinger, which serve only to give direction, the velocity being\r\ncommunicated by the becket and forefinger. The former flies off from the\r\ndart the instant its velocity becomes greater than that of the hand, but\r\nit remains on the finger ready to be used again.”\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the Australian implement is much the more reliable\r\nand effective. Cook mentions that with the dart the Tanna Islanders “are\r\nsure of hitting a mark within the compass of the crown of a hat at a\r\ndistance of eight or ten yards; but at double that distance it is chance\r\nif they hit a mark the size of a man's body, though they will throw the\r\nweapon sixty or seventy yards.” Such a standard of marksmanship would be\r\nregarded with contempt by the average black of North Queensland. The\r\nuse of this becket (introduced very many years ago by the Kanaka) is a\r\nfairly common accomplishment among coastal blacks.\r\n\r\nIn shallow water, too, fish are chased until they become so exhausted\r\nand nerve-shaken that they partially bury themselves in the sand, or\r\nendeavour to elude observation by concealing themselves beneath stone\r\nor coral, or by remaining passive among seaweed, trusting, no doubt, to\r\nprotective tints and assimilation with their surroundings. Few of these\r\nstratagems of the fish are of avail when once a hungry black is on its\r\ntrack. The science of war, we are bidden to believe, is not designed\r\nfor the slaughter of mankind, but so to impress the enemy with a\r\ndemonstration of overwhelming power, force, and majesty, that he may\r\nbecome mentally unable or unwilling to offer resistance, because of its\r\nobvious futility. So it is with the black in pursuit of a fish or turtle\r\nin shallow water. By noise and bluster he works on the senses of the\r\nfish until it becomes semi-paralysed. Then he proceeds callously to the\r\nkilling, which, in the case of fish, if his right hand is encumbered,\r\nhe generally accomplishes by a crunching bite into the back-bone at the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nAt rare intervals the black varies his tactics by a night attack, which\r\nis often highly demoralising. When the moon is on the other side of the\r\nworld, with spears and flaring torches of paper-bark, he rushes in a\r\nband to raid the reef, to the dismay of startled and bewildered fish.\r\nSubstitute for the gurgling cadences of semi-submerged coral and\r\nmuteness and universal dimness instant noise and splashing, and dazzling\r\nlights here and there and everywhere, and it is not to be considered\r\nstrange that the fish--tipsy with panic and confusion--fail to exercise\r\ntheir habitual alertness.\r\n\r\nAt a certain season of the year--November and December in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dunk Island--myriads of fish, about the size of a\r\nsardine, appear in shoals, an acre or so in area, or encircle the\r\nislands with a living, bluish-grey frill yards broad. The blacks bestow\r\non this godsend, popularly known as “sprats”--HARENGULA STEREOLEPIS\r\n(Ogilby)--the name of “Oon-gnahr.”\r\n\r\nHow skilfully does Nature dovetail her designs! This great multitude\r\nof fish appears when it is most needed. The terns (sea-swallows)\r\nare rearing their families, and ever need fresh food in unstinted\r\nquantities. The small fry come to an excited and enthusiastic market.\r\nSlim, silvery kingfish, grey sharks, and blue bonito, harry the shoals,\r\nripping through them with steel-like flashes, and as the little fish\r\nruffle the surface of sea or emerge therefrom in living silvery spray,\r\nin frantic efforts to escape, the terns take all they want, screaming\r\nwith satisfaction. Then, too, the blacks join in the work of\r\ndestruction. When the frill of fish lies limp on the beach, they\r\nfabricate a seine net, cheap, but admirably suited for the purpose. Long\r\nstrands of beach trailers and grass and slender twigs are rolled and\r\ntwisted up--apparently without the slightest art--into a huge loose\r\ncable eight inches in diameter. The men run out the cable into the water\r\nat right angles to the beach while still the gins, with nervous haste,\r\nare adding to its length. If it breaks, a few twists and pokes suffice\r\nto repair it. The men at the lead curve in towards the beach, and the\r\ngins and piccaninnies wade out in line to meet them. Gradually the\r\ncable, shocking in its frailty, is worked in, enclosing a patch of\r\nthe fish in a perilous coffer dam. Tumult and commotion are almost\r\nas necessary contributories to the success of the stratagem as is the\r\ncable. But before they realise what has happened, they are in such close\r\ncompany that escape is impossible; dilly-bags are filled in a single\r\ndip, and it may take half an hour to pick out those “meshed” in the\r\ncable. It is all the work of a few minutes, and the haul often amounts\r\nin quantity to a surfeit for the whole camp.\r\n\r\nOne of these rude seines which was overhauled was composed largely\r\nof the long, leafless, twine-like branches of the leafless parasite\r\nCASSYTHA FILIFORMIS (which the blacks term “Bungoonno”), IPOMEA\r\nPESCAPRAE (“Koree”), Blady-grass (“Jin-dagi”), and the tough sprawling\r\nbranches of BLAINVILLEA LATIFOLIA (“Gallan-jarrah”), the whole being\r\nreinforced with withes of CLERODENDRON IMERME (“Missim”), all of which\r\nplants grow on the verge of the sea.\r\n\r\nVast as is the congregation of small fry, it gradually fritters away,\r\nmartyred to fish, flesh, and fowl. By the time the little terns are\r\nthrown upon their own resources the violet frill of the sweet islands is\r\nfrayed and ragged, and drifts loosely in shabby remnants.\r\n\r\nFor large fish--groper, the giant perch, king, bonito, rhoombah,\r\nsweet-lips, parrot-fish, sea-mullet, and the sting-rays (brown and\r\ngrey)--a harpoon and long line are used. When iron is not available a\r\npoint is made of one of the black palms, the barb being strapped on with\r\nfibre, the binding being made impervious to water by a liberal coating\r\nof a pitch-like substance prepared from the resinous gum of the\r\narral-tree (EVODIA ACCEDENS).\r\n\r\nThe point is eight or ten inches long, the barbless end being swathed in\r\nfibre so that it may fit easily into the socket of the eight or ten feet\r\nshaft. A long line is tied to a point above the swathing, and, being\r\ndrawn taut along the shaft, is secured to the end by a series of\r\nclove-hitches. When the fish is struck the point is drawn from the\r\nsocket, while the shaft acts as a cheek on, and an indicator of, its\r\ncourse when just below the surface. Such harpoons and lines are also\r\nused for the capture of dugong and turtle, the line being made of the\r\ninner bark (the bast layer) of one of the fig-trees, and is of two\r\nstrands only. Occasionally the HIBISCUS TILLIACEUS is laid under tribute\r\nfor ropes and lines, which, however, are not considered as durable as\r\nthose from the fig. Nets, set and hand, are also made with twine from\r\nthe fig or hibiscus.\r\n\r\nWhen, at low spring tides, the coral reef is uncovered, small rock-cod,\r\nslim eels, parrot-fish, perch, soles, the lovely blue-spotted sting-ray,\r\ncatfish, flathead, etc., are poked out unceremoniously with spears or\r\nsharp-pointed sticks from labyrinthine mazes, or from the concealment\r\nafforded by the flabby folds and fringes of the skeleton-less coral\r\n(ALCYONARIA), or from among the weeds and stones--a kind of additional\r\nsense leading the black to the discovery of fish in places that a white\r\nman would never dream of investigating. At this opportune time, too,\r\nhuge, defiantly armed and brilliantly coloured crayfish are exposed to\r\ncapture. A statement was published recently that this was the speediest\r\nof all marine animals. The assertion is much to be questioned, but there\r\ncan be no doubt that the crayfish is a wonderful sprinter. Familiar with\r\nits lack of staying power, blacks race after it uproariously as it flees\r\nface to foe, all the graduated blades of its turbine apparatus beating\r\nunder high pressure. Two or three rushes and the crayfish pauses, and\r\nthen the agile black breaks its long, exquisitely sensitive and brittle\r\nantennae, deprived of which it becomes less capable of taking care of\r\nitself; or it may find its gorgeous armour-plates smashed with a stone\r\nor penetrated by a spear. For the most part, however, the crayfish\r\nlurks in coral caves, sweeping a considerable frontal radius with\r\never-shifting antennae--not in pride or conceit of their beautiful tints\r\nand wonderful mechanism, but with a pitiful apprehension of danger, for\r\nthe admirers of the creature are many and ever so much in earnest--the\r\nearnestness of unceasing voracity.\r\n\r\nHaving a decided partiality for eels, the blacks of North Queensland\r\nhave devised several means of capture, one of which does not call for\r\nthe exercise of the least skill on the part of the individual whose\r\nlonging for the dainty becomes imperative. His placid perseverance,\r\ntoo, is of no avail, unless luck favours. Wading in a shallow,\r\nmangrove-bordered creek, he blindly probes the bottom with a six-feet\r\nlength of fencing wire, the modern substitute for the black palm spear.\r\nFrequently he trifles thus with coy Fortune for hours, an inch or so\r\nseparating each prod; and again, in a spasm of indignant impatience,\r\nhe stabs determinedly into the mud at random. Non-success does not make\r\nshipwreck of his faith in the existence of the much-desired food in\r\nthe black mud, for as far back as his own experience and the camp's\r\ntraditions go, substantial reason for that faith has been plentifully\r\nrevealed. He returns to the monotonous occupation until an unlucky eel\r\nis impaled, and then it is given no chance of escape.\r\n\r\nPushing his spear a couple of feet through, the boy grips the prize\r\nwith both hands, or bends the wire into the form of a hook. Fortune may\r\ncontinue to smile, and the boy takes several during the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMany boys enhance the charms of solitude by ingeniously tricking\r\neels, Nature presenting them with an efficient engine of deceit and\r\ndestruction, so designed that neither the agitations of art nor the\r\ninvention of science could much improve it. About two feet of the thong\r\nor lorum of one of the creeping palms (CALAMUS OBSTRUENS) is all that\r\nis necessary. These lora are armed with definitely spaced whorls of\r\nrecurved hooks, keen as needles, true as steel, about one-eighth of\r\nan inch long. Three or four of the whorls are removed to provide an\r\nunfretful but firm grip. The pot-holes and shallow pools and gullies\r\nand trickling creeks are populated by nervous, yet inquisitive,\r\nsemi-transparent prawns, upon which eels liberally diet. So silent and\r\nsteady of movement is the boy that even the alert prawns are unaware\r\nof, or become accustomed to, his presence; and what is there to warn the\r\neel, enjoying its comfort among the dead leaves in the gloomiest corner\r\nof the pool, of danger? Could any but a black boy detect the difference\r\nbetween the brown sodden leaves and the half-inch of body which the eel\r\nhas unwittingly exposed? The “pig-gee” (as some term the lorum) is used\r\nwith almost surgical delicacy of touch to hook away two or three of the\r\nleaves. Then it is placed parallel to whatever increased length has thus\r\nbeen made visible, and with a decisive twitch the eel is torn from its\r\nretreat and killed off-hand.\r\n\r\nEven the shy, long-armed little prawns (PALAEMON AUSTRALIS) do not\r\nescape special means for their destruction. A pliant rod about four\r\nfeet long is improvised from the midrib of the creeping palm before\r\nmentioned, to the end of which is fastened a slender thread of the same\r\nmaterial, split off by using the nails of the thumb and second finger.\r\nThis strand, which is about four inches long, is delicately noosed.\r\nStanding a few feet away from the water-hole, the black so manipulates\r\nthe line that the noose encircles the tail of the prawn, which, making\r\na retrogressive dart upon alarm, finds itself fatally snared. The prawns\r\nare not, as a rule, eaten, being reserved for bait.\r\n\r\nIn creeks and lagoons thin, hollow logs are submerged. Eels naturally\r\nseek such refuges, and in due course the boy dives, and, sealing the\r\nends with his hands, brings log and eel to land. Dr. W. E. Roth mentions\r\nthat crayfish and a certain fish resembling the rock-cod are similarly\r\ncaptured, and remarks that the log is lifted at an angle, with one hand\r\nclosing the lower aperture, in which position it is brought to and held\r\nabove the surface, when the water trickles out between the fingers of\r\nthe sealing hand.\r\n\r\nYet another method (analogous to “bobbing”) is practised for securing\r\neels. Huge worms, found under decaying logs, are threaded by means of a\r\nneedle formed of a thin strip of cane on a line from ten to twelve\r\nfeet long until several feet of bait are available. The line is merely\r\ndoubled, the ends made fast to a stout pole, and the loop dangled in the\r\nwater. The boy fishes patiently, nor does he strike at the first nibble,\r\nbut permits the eel to swallow slowly what might be considered an undue\r\nproportion of the bait, when it is landed and compelled to disgorge for\r\nthe benefit of the next comer.\r\n\r\nAmong coastal blacks--all of whom may be said to be fishermen--some are\r\nardent devotees to the sea. Others of the same camp restrict themselves\r\nto unsensational creeks and lagoons. The frog in the well knows nothing\r\nof the salt sea, and its aboriginal prototype contents himself with\r\nmilder and generally less remunerative kind of sport than that in which\r\nhis bolder cousins revel. Such a man, however, may possess aquatic lore\r\nof which the other is admittedly ignorant, and be apt in devices\r\ntowards which the attitude of the salt-water man is adverse, if not\r\ncontemptuous. The fresh-water man is skilful in the use of a net shaped\r\nsomething like the secondary wings of a certain species of moth, and\r\nexpanding and closing similarly. It is made of fine twine (one-inch\r\nmesh), preferably from the bark of one of the fig-trees or the brown\r\nkurrajong, tightly stretched on two pieces of lawyer-cane each bent\r\nto form the half of an irregular ellipse. This net (“moorgaroo”) is\r\nmanipulated by two men working in concert, principally for the capture\r\nof eels. They do not wait for the eel to come to them, but by shrewd\r\nscrutiny discover its whereabouts under the bank of the creek or among\r\nthe weeds and roots. Then one silent man holds the net widespread, or\r\nadroitly dodges it into intercepting positions, while the other beats\r\nthe luckless fish in its direction with more or less fluster. The\r\npersistency with which the creeks are patrolled by men with spears,\r\nnetted and poisoned, invites one to marvel that any fish escape, and yet\r\nonce again quite a haul is made.\r\n\r\nThat great philosopher, Herbert Spencer, once in his life made a joke\r\nand confessed to it, with apologies for its littleness. Lunching at a\r\ntavern in the Isle of Wight, he asked: “Oh, is not this a very large\r\nchop for such a small island?” Similarly, I have been astonished at\r\nthe apparent disproportion between the size of the eel and the\r\ninsignificance of the creek whence the exultant black has hauled it.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the poor part which the slimmest eel plays when pitted\r\nagainst the Smartness and resourcefulness of the black may be related.\r\nA large eel, in a moment of indiscretion, showed itself in a fairly deep\r\ncreek. Bewailing the absence of his wing-net, or “moorgaroo,” the boy\r\nhunted the elusive fish hither and thither with cunning determination.\r\nAt last it disappeared under a log. In most of his activities the black\r\nboy sniffs at conventions. Hastily stripping, the boy dived and when\r\nhe reappeared the eel was vainly squirming in one of the legs of his\r\ntrousers which had been knotted below the knee.\r\n\r\nAnother boy, a stranger, brought with him traditions which he\r\nsuccessfully materialised in favour of the employment of several light\r\ndarts instead of a single heavy spear for fishing. The subject was\r\nfrequently debated, but none of the camp adopted George's theories. His\r\nfavourite weapons were the dried stems of an all too common weed, which\r\ngenerally grows straight and true. Into the thick end he would insert a\r\nfour-inch length of No. 10 fencing wire, sharpened to a delicate point,\r\nand with a battery of eight or ten of these he would sally forth. His\r\nbag averaged high. Often he treated me to practical demonstrations of\r\nthe success of his methods. A big flathead reposed in two feet of\r\nwater, half buried in the sand. George had one of his darts fast in a\r\ntwinkling, and the fish flashed away, the tip indicating its movement.\r\nIn a few minutes the hapless flathead was carrying no less than six\r\ndarts, and as such a handicap was absurd it abandoned the race for life.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he struck a big sting-ray so full of his impish\r\ndarts that it resembled an animated pincushion of monstrous proportions.\r\nIt, too, realised the futility of kicking against so many pricks. On\r\nthe other hand, Tom, with his heavy shaft and barbed point, relied on\r\na single weapon. It seldom failed, for his right arm was strong and\r\ndisciplined to a nicety.\r\n\r\nOn a shallow tidal creek a settler had made a corduroy crossing of\r\nthe fibrous trunks of the Pandanus palms, which the blacks of the\r\nneighbourhood turned to account in the capture of fish. A few frail\r\nsticks, artlessly interwoven with grass, formed a primitive weir at\r\nthe down-stream end of the crossing. Fish which went up with the tide\r\nfrequently found themselves stranded on the way down, for the water\r\npassed freely between the palm-tree trunks without affording them right\r\nof way, and the rude weir often stopped for ever belated bream, mullet,\r\nand barramundi. This simple trap, though it does not appear to be put\r\ninto use on the coast generally, seems almost to indicate an instinctive\r\nknowledge of a studied design described to me by an observant friend who\r\nhas travelled into many an odd nook and corner of Queensland. On a deep\r\nbut narrow tributary of the Georgina River a permanent trap on a large\r\nscale was wont to be maintained. A tree had been felled across the\r\nstream so that each end of the trunk was supported by the respective\r\nbank. Straight stakes were driven firmly into the bed of the creek as\r\nclosely together as possible, the heads resting against the horizontal\r\ntree-trunk. This palisading formed the base of an embankment of packed\r\ngrass and rubbish, sufficiently tight to raise the level of the stream\r\nabout three feet. In the middle of the embankment, and about one foot\r\nbelow water-level, a hole about one foot square had been cut. A platform\r\nabout ten feet long by three feet wide, having a fall of about one\r\nfoot and formed of a number of straight saplings laid parallel with the\r\nstream, and supported by a couple of transverse bearers on four stout\r\nforked sticks, received the escape from the sluice. At the lower end of\r\nthe platform was a rough weir of twisted grass, which was continued up\r\neach side for about half its length. Water passed with little hindrance\r\nthrough the platform, while jew-fish, yellow-tail, and bream, were\r\nretained in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nMany years have elapsed--peradventure centuries--since the blacks of\r\nMissionary Bay, Hinchinbrook Island, built a weir of blocks and boulders\r\nof granite which oysters cemented here and there. On the fulness of\r\nspring tides fish frolicked over and among the boulders. Those which\r\ndelayed their exit found themselves in an enclosed pool which at certain\r\nseasons of the year runs dry. To this day the sea continues to pay\r\ntribute, though the blacks of the locality have passed away, and there\r\nis none but the red-backed sea-eagle or the heavy-flighted osprey and a\r\nrare and casual white man, to receive it. Among the few emblems of the\r\nvanishing race, this persistent weir-taking toll of the fish month after\r\nmonth, year after Year, for the benefit of successive generations of\r\neagles and ospreys, appeals vividly to the imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what can be ascertained at this late date, pearl shell hooks\r\nwere very sure and killing, but seem to have been used principally for\r\nsmaller fish--whiting, perch, bream, flathead, etc.--the occurrence\r\nof large hooks being exceedingly rare. Mullet (if tradition is to be\r\ncredited) were seldom caught by hook and line, but were speared among\r\nthe mangroves at high tide--a practice which prevails to this day.\r\nThe Dunk Island examples have a resemblance to one of the forms of\r\npearl-shell hooks used by the Tahitians in Captain Cook's day.\r\n\r\nTortoise-shell hooks capable of holding large kingfish and fair sized\r\nsharks are common among the natives of Darnley Island, Torres Straits.\r\nDuring the process of cutting and paring the hooks to the size and\r\ndesign required, the shell is frequently immersed in boiling water,\r\nwhich temporarily overcomes its inherent toughness. Incidentally, it may\r\nbe pointed out that the evidence derivable from these fish-hooks does\r\nnot afford proof of Papuan influence on the mind of the Australian\r\naboriginal, except at the extreme north of Cape York Peninsula and a few\r\nmiles down the eastern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. This default\r\nseems the more remarkable in face of the fact that outrigger canoes,\r\ndoubtless of Papuan or Malayan origin, were known as far south as the\r\nJohnstone River.\r\n\r\nTo say that the coastal blacks of North Queensland had no knowledge of\r\nthe use of barbed hooks is misleading. In sheer desperation, when the\r\nsupply of pearl-shell hooks was exhausted, they were wont to attach\r\nbait to their harpoon-points, and they used such unpropitious means\r\nsuccessfully, and occasionally made a miniature hook by tying a sharp\r\nspur to a thin, straight stick. Recent proof has been obtained of the\r\nuse of the lorum of one of the creeping palms, from which all the spurs\r\nsave three at the thicker end were scraped off. With the knowledge of\r\nthe efficacy of the barb under extraordinary circumstances, is it not\r\nthe more remarkable that they failed to employ it systematically? Dr.\r\nW. E. Roth describes crescentic hooks of coco-nut shell and wooden hooks\r\nwith bone barb, and also barbs improvised from one of the spines of the\r\ncatfish. He also mentions as “the most primitive form of hook” the\r\ndried tendril of HUGONIA JENKENSII (“pattel-pattel” of the Dunk Island\r\nblacks). To anyone familiar with the crescent pearl-shell hooks, the use\r\nof the singular tendrils of the Hugonia would immediately be suggested;\r\nbut my observation, inquiries, and opinion do not support the theory.\r\nThe shape of the tendril is all that can be said in its favour. It is\r\nneither sharp nor tough enough for actual use.\r\n\r\nWith these barbless hooks the bait was not impaled, but strapped on with\r\nshreds of bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCOTICS AND POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said of the great Mogul Emperor Babur that he boasted of being\r\nable to make fish drunk so that he might haul them in shoals, and when\r\n“Carathis” pronounced her “barbarous incantations” the fish with one\r\naccord thrust forth their heads from the water. Is it generally known\r\nthat the North Queensland blacks also are expert in the use of narcotics\r\nand indifferent to the ethics of sport? The most commonly used of the\r\nfish poisons on the coast of North Queensland is likewise employed by\r\nthe natives of Zambesi Land for a similar purpose. The plant is known\r\nbotanically as “Derris.” Two varieties, “scandens” and “uligijiosa,” are\r\nknown in this State. The aboriginal titles vary in different localities,\r\nbut “Paggarra” will suit the present purpose. Some blacks are so\r\noffensively civilised that they know the plant by the name of “Wild\r\nDynamite.” Possibly it owes its popularity among fish poisons to the\r\nfact that it is the handiest of all. It trails over the rocks, just out\r\nof touch of high-water mark, but not beyond the reach of the spray\r\nof surges. With roots investigating inclement crevices, and salt air\r\ndamping its leaves, the plant flourishes, and flowers prettily in\r\ngraceful racemes. In the semi-obscurity of the crevices the flowers put\r\non a tinge of pink, literally blushing unseen. The heartless blacks tear\r\nup the plant, branches, leaves, flowers and all, coarsely bundle them\r\ntogether, and, wading into an enclosed pool where fish are observed,\r\nbeat the mass (after dipping it into the water and while held in the\r\nleft hand) with a nulla-nulla. The action is repeated until the bark and\r\nleaves are macerated, and then the bundle is thrown into the pool. In\r\na few minutes the fish rise to the surface, gasping and making\r\nextraordinary efforts to get out of the infected water. Death ensues\r\nrapidly, but the fish are quite wholesome as food.\r\n\r\nAnother of the vegetable poisons is known as “Raroo” (CAREYA AUSTRALIS).\r\nThe bark at the base of the trunk and of the roots contains an effective\r\nprinciple, which is released in a somewhat similar fashion to that\r\nemployed with “Paggarra.”\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the handsome, shrubby tree known botanically as DIOSPYROS\r\nHEBECARPA is also a most effective fish poison. It is oval-shaped, red\r\nwhen ripe, and, as the name implies, covered with soft, fine hair. For\r\nall its lofty title and attractive appearance, the fruit is deceptive,\r\nfor it bites and blisters the lips and tongue like caustic, and on\r\nbeing bruised and thrown into a pool on the reef, all fish are killed\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nA different and, for a black, singularly complicated process is employed\r\nfor the extraction of the noxious principle residing in the plant known\r\nas “Koie-yan” (FARADAYA SPLENDIDA). This is one of the most rampant and\r\nambitious of the many vines of the jungle.\r\n\r\nIt combines exceeding vigour with rare gracefulness. The leaves are a\r\nlight glossy green, ovate, and often a foot long, while the flowers\r\nare pure white (resembling slightly the azalea, but free from its\r\nfragility), large, and with an elusive scent, sweet and yet indefinite.\r\nThe fruit, smooth and of porcelain whiteness, varies in size and shape,\r\nand is said to be edible, though blacks ignore it. A large marble and\r\nan undersized hen's egg may dangle together, or in company with others,\r\nfrom the topmost branches of some tall tree, which has acted as host to\r\nthe clinging vine. The handsome but inconsiderate plant is turned\r\nfrom its purpose of lending fictitious and fugitive charms to quite\r\ncommonplace but passive trees to the office of stupefying uncomplaining\r\nfish. But the element which holds such deadly enmity to the sense of the\r\nfish is not obtainable by the simple primary means successful with other\r\nplants. Indeed, the process is quite elaborate, and goes to prove that\r\nthe Australian aboriginal has to his credit as a chemist the results of\r\nsuccessful original research, and that he is also a herbalist from whom\r\nit is no condescension to learn. In this detail, at any rate, he is\r\ndistinctly an accomplished person. Portions of the vine are cut into\r\nfoot lengths; the outer layer of bark is removed and rejected, the\r\nmiddle layer alone being preserved. This is carefully scraped off and\r\nmade up into shapely little piles on fresh green leaves. One might\r\nimagine that a black boy preparing the deadly “Koie-yan” was really\r\nplaying at chemist's shop with neat-handed scrupulousness. When a\r\nsufficiency is obtained it is rubbed on to stones previously heated by\r\nfire. The stones then being thrown into a creek or a little lagoon left\r\nby the receding tide, the poison becomes disseminated, with fatal effect\r\nto all fish and other marine animals.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out, however, by Dr. Hamlyn-Harris that the nature of the\r\nactive principle of the “Koie yan” does not permit of elaboration by\r\nsuch means. The heating of the shredded bark would, therefore, appear\r\nto fall into line with the gibberish of ancient alchemists. It would\r\nbewilder the uninitiated without enhancing results.\r\n\r\nMany other plants supply the means of killing small fish wholesale, or\r\nof reducing them to palsied cripples. The three described are fairly\r\ncommon, and have, therefore, been selected to point a moral. Poisoning\r\nfish is a poor sort of sport, perhaps, but there are two classes of\r\nfishermen--the hungry and the artistic. The latter use flimsy tackle and\r\ncomplicated gear, and play the game, giving the victims to their wiles a\r\nsporting chance. Though not the only representative of the hungry class,\r\nthe black boy generally fishes on an empty stomach, and his demeanour\r\ncoincides. No slobbering sentiment affects him. Yet he is not so cruel\r\nas the mean white who throws a plug of dynamite into the river while\r\nthe fish are enjoying their crowded hour, though he will with as little\r\ntaint upon his conscience poison a pool full of fish as drag with hooked\r\nstick a reluctant crab piecemeal from its burrow among the mangrove\r\nroots. But then he is responding to the appeals of a clamant and\r\nnot over-particular stomach, while your dynamitard is occasionally a\r\nwell-fed barbarian with a queasy palate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY-FISHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neatest and most artistic method by which the blacks kill fish\r\nnecessitates the employment of a particular species of spider known to\r\nthe learned as NEPHILA MACULATA PISCATORUM. This spider was discovered\r\non Dunk Island by Macgillivray, the naturalist of the expedition of\r\nH.M.S. RATTLESNAKE in 1848. It has a large ovate abdomen of olive-green\r\nbespangled with golden dust; black thorax, with coral-red mandibles;\r\nand long, slender legs, glossy black, and tricked out at the joints with\r\ngolden touches. A fine creature, gentle and stately in demeanour, it\r\nspins a large web, strong enough to hold the biggest of beetles\r\nand other insects, and, to harmonise with the superior air of the\r\nmanufacturer, the gossamer is of golden-green. The great spider at the\r\nfocus of the resplendent web is a frequent and conspicuous ornament\r\nto the edges of the jungle, and having no fear, and no indocility of\r\ntemper, it undergoes the ordeal of admiration with an assumption\r\nof disdainful coquettism. The local name of this comely creature\r\nis “Karan-jamara.” Shameless polyandrist, she maintains several\r\nconsorts--from three to five seems to be the average number--and\r\nthey, semi-transparent, feeble, meek, subdued little fellows, maintain\r\nprecarious isolated existences in the outskirts of the web.\r\n\r\nThough my own experience is negative, direct incontrovertible evidence\r\nis extant to the effect that birds often meet their fate by blundering\r\ninto the web, to be devoured by the nimble and gaily decorated owner. I\r\nhave frequently seen karan-jamara disposing of hard-shelled beetles\r\nas big in bulk as some birds, and the strongest of butterflies, once\r\nentangled, is powerless. The long-legged spider leaps on the struggling\r\nprey and stills its beating wings with one pinch of powerful red\r\nmandibles. March flies form the most frequent diet. One has been\r\nobserved to dispose of fourteen of the great stupid flies in a single\r\nevening, and if the flies could reason they might, while whimpering\r\nbecause of the existence of such voracious spiders, acknowledge that\r\nthey design their webs in a very perplexing and masterly manner.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of inquiries--the results of which are herein recorded--a\r\ncasual black boy, a stranger to these parts, and therefore unfamiliar\r\nwith the local name and the special purpose to which the spider is put,\r\nwas cross-examined. At first he failed to recognise the photograph, but\r\nwhen it was explained by the pointed allusion to a living Maltese-cross\r\nspider close at hand, a gleam of intelligence brightened his bewildered\r\nface, and he delivered a self-satisfied dissertation on the order\r\nArachnida that is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n“That fella Oo-boo-boo. That fella mammy belonga 'nother fella\r\naltogether. You no savee, come close up--that fella ply way. You no\r\nsavee, come close up, that fella no good; that fella vite.”\r\n\r\nAnd the boy looked gravely sagacious and smiled the wide, wise smile\r\nbetokening proud superiority of information. Had Macgillivray but known\r\nthat the “Oo-boo-boo” was the parent of all the many species, and that\r\nit belongs to the discreetly valorous class that “vites” and flies away,\r\nand lives to “vite” another day, he might have achieved renown of a\r\nmore popular kind than is the reward of the unromantic naturalist who\r\ndiscovers merely a superior spider.\r\n\r\nThis spider is used on some of the rivers as a lure, virtues almost\r\nirresistible being ascribed to it. Experiments in salt water, though not\r\nabsolutely negative in their results, have not afforded any specially\r\nexciting sport; but possibly the fascination of the lure is more\r\nefficient in fresh than in salt water, and is influential over the\r\nhabitual caution throughout a certain species of fish only. The trick is\r\nworked in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe angler takes a light, thin switch and entangles one end in the web,\r\nwhich, by dexterous waving action, is converted (without being touched\r\nwith the fingers) into a strand about two feet long. The spider is\r\nsecured and squashed, and the end of the line moistened in the juices of\r\nthe body, some of the fragments of which are reserved for bait, and\r\nalso to be thrown into the water as a preliminary charm. These buoyant\r\ntitbits attract shoals of small fish, among which the line, with its\r\nextract of spider, is delicately trailed; a fish rises to the lure, the\r\ngossamer becomes entangled in its teeth, and it is landed by a brisk yet\r\neasy movement of the wrist. A great angler recently said that throwing\r\na fly is an act of feeling or instinct rather than reason. So the black\r\nboy with a careless flourish fills his dilly-bag, while he smiles at the\r\nserious attempts of the white man to imitate his skill.\r\n\r\nOwing to the brevity and the frailness of the line, the catch is limited\r\nto fish under the recognised standard as to size. Tests prove that the\r\nbreaking strain of the line is nearly three-quarters of a pound, but the\r\nweight of the individual is of no great consideration, since numbers are\r\ncaught quickly. The gossamer is singularly sticky. The viscid substance\r\nwith which it is coated is not readily dissolvable in water; indeed,\r\nwater seems to have the effect of hardening it, so that the line'\r\nwears longer than might be expected. Piquant morsels of the spider are\r\nentangled in the frayed end of the line as its original potency becomes\r\nnon-effective.\r\n\r\nA friend for whose edification this novel method was demonstrated thus\r\nwrites it:\r\n\r\n“It did not take the boy long to get ready. They simply broke a switch\r\nabout three feet long and attached a portion of the web about six inches\r\nlong to the end; squeezed out on to a leaf the fluid internals of the\r\nspider, into which they dipped the end of the line, started a rather\r\nmelodious chant, and put the line in shallow water. I was only a few\r\nfeet away and could see no fish at first, but they came very soon. They\r\nwere very small, about one and a half inches long. They fasten their\r\nteeth in the web, and are lifted out quite slowly. Some require to be\r\npulled off the line after being landed. I watched for about ten minutes,\r\nduring which time seventeen were caught.”\r\n\r\nSir William Macgreggor, ex-Governor of Queensland, has described the\r\nPapuan art of fishing by means of kites, the lure being a tassel of the\r\nweb of a spider of the Nephila species. No doubt the blacks here made an\r\nindependent and original discovery, and in their simplicity applied\r\nit in a different, but none the less effective, style from that of the\r\nadvanced Papuan.\r\n\r\nThus, to use the web and the fragments of a spider for fly-fishing is\r\ncertainly meting out poetic justice to the spider on account of the many\r\nensnared flies; and the black angler never pauses to reflect whether\r\nthe comminuted remains of a spider can possibly be construed into a fair\r\nfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II--MISCELLANEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A PEARL?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a pearl? The substance of a sensation--the consolidation of\r\ndiscomfort on the part of an oyster or other nacre-secreting mollusc. It\r\nis a globular deposit of carbonate of lime, with a very small proportion\r\nof water, generally enclosing a trifle which is its cause and core\r\nand, so to speak, is a waste product of the body's chemistry. In the\r\nrestricted, scientific sense, “true pearls are bodies consisting of\r\ncalcareous material with an organic basis.” Similar bodies having cores\r\nof sand grains or other foreign substance are known as “blisters.”\r\n\r\nScience, which peers and probes into the innermost affairs of oysters,\r\nand speaks of them in terms of uneasy familiarity, asserts that pearls\r\nare frequently caused by a parasite to which they are subject.\r\n\r\nIt would ill become one who has no scientific pretensions to suggest\r\nother definitions, though he may claim to be among the few who have\r\nbeen privileged to observe a pearl in the making, or, rather, to watch\r\nNature's finishing touches.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the oyster the radical home cure for the living irritant\r\nor insoluble substance which had gained entrance between its valves\r\nis an encasement of pearl-film. If this encasement is globular or\r\npear-shaped, or takes the form of a button and is lucid, lustrous,\r\nflawless, and of large size, it may be of almost inestimable worth.\r\n\r\nDoes the proud beauty who glories in the possession of a pearl\r\ncondescend to imagine that she flaunts on her bosom just so many tombs\r\ncontaining the dust of the germs of a parasite? Does she not rather love\r\nto think of the gems as emblems of almost celestial purity, and to dwell\r\non the fable of the Persians rather than the audacious modern fact?\r\n\r\nAddison has set the fable in imperishable gold: A drop of water fell out\r\nof a cloud into the sea, and finding herself lost in such immensity of\r\nfluid matter, broke out into the following reflection: “Alas! What an\r\ninconsiderable creature am I in this prodigious ocean of waters; my\r\nexistence is of no concern to the universe; I am reduced to a kind of\r\nnothing, and am less than the least of the works of God.” It so happened\r\nthat an oyster which lay in the neighbourhood chanced to gape and\r\nswallow it up in the midst of this its humble soliloquy. The drop, says\r\nthe fable, lay a great while hardening in the shell, until by degrees it\r\nwas ripened into a pearl, which, falling into the hands of a diver after\r\na long series of adventures, is at present that famous pearl which is\r\naffixed on the top of the Persian diadem.\r\n\r\nThough one may count his pearls by the score, the hoard may be\r\nvalueless. Upon such examples entertaining, if not valuable, experiments\r\nmay be made without affectation or giving hostages to fortune. In all\r\nthe little deformed specimens thus dissected the core has been found to\r\nconsist of a foreign substance, generally what seemed under a microscope\r\nof limited power a speck of dirt. The heart of one was a blob of\r\nmud, which gave off a most baleful vapour. This was the result of the\r\nhouse-cleaning of a common, edible rock oyster, and the pearl, dirty\r\ngreen and lustreless, merely a thin casket, for the noisome mud had not\r\nsolidified. The care with which the impurity had been rendered innocuous\r\ndemonstrated the correct ideas of the oyster on sanitation. No doubt the\r\ngerm of the special form of tape-worm which troubles oysters, irritates\r\nto pearl-making, and passes through other transformations in other\r\nhosts, and completes its cycle in the body of a shark, would be too\r\nminute for inexpert detection. The fact that molluscs do intern foreign\r\nand obnoxious substances is testimony to their decency and love of\r\ncleanliness, and so may the pearl be still accepted as the embodiment of\r\npurity. Though all its little soul be dirt, the pearl is pure, and but\r\nfor the dirt or the germ of a filthy ailment it would not be pearl.\r\n\r\nSo many molluscs produce pearls that it would be absurd for the great\r\noyster family to set up exclusive rights. They do not, for your oyster\r\nis ever humble even when tenanted with a rivalless pearl. On the coast\r\nof North Queensland, within the Great Barrier Reef, pinnas of at least\r\ntwo species are among the producing agents, which, covering a wide\r\nrange, seem to meet in two distinct genera, far apart in appearance and\r\nhabit. There is the frail, flat, translucent “window-shell” (Placuna),\r\nthe valves of which fit so closely that the poor little inhabitant\r\nis squeezed to a wafer, a film, a fragment of muscle. Yet in some\r\nlocalities nearly every individual has a pearl, pretty in tint, but\r\ntoo minute to be of value. An allied species is common on the coast of\r\nChina, where the pearls are collected for export to India, to be reduced\r\nto lime by calcination for the use of luxurious betel-nut chewers. These\r\nalmost microscopic pearls are also burnt in the mouths of the dead who\r\nhave been influential and wealthy.\r\n\r\nCoal-black pearls occur in one of the pinnas, the interior of which\r\nis sooty, shot with iridescent purple, and since the pearl, whether\r\nproduced by oyster, mussel, pinna, or window-shell, is generally more\r\nbrilliant than the containing shell, that of the black pinna, with the\r\nhigh lights of its environment concentrated, may be a gem of surpassing\r\nnovelty and beauty. But the habitual product of this pinna is small,\r\ndull, mud-tinted or brown, and of no value whatever. Another of the\r\ngenera grows “seed” of excellent lustre, corresponding with the azure\r\nbrightness of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe chief source of orient pearls on the coast of North Queensland\r\nis the gold-lip mother-of-pearl PINCTADA MAXIMA, while the black lip\r\nPINCTADA MARGARITIFERA occasionally yields fine and flawless specimens\r\nof a silvery lustre. One which is still lovingly remembered was of pale\r\nblue and wonderfully lighted. The commonest of the giant clams TRIDACNA\r\nGIGAS sometimes betrays evidence of past internal trouble by the\r\npresence of a concretion of porcelain whiteness and of porcellaneous\r\ntexture, but such are not to be described as pearls and to be prized as\r\nrarities only.\r\n\r\nThat some huge molluscs produced pearls before man, with his faculty for\r\nadmiration, came on the scene is proved by their existence as fossils in\r\nchalk. Hemispherical specimens have been found on the inner surface of a\r\nshell which has no living representative--viz., the Inoceramus (some\r\nof which attained a length of two feet)--and spherical ones of the same\r\nprismatical structure occur detached in the chalk. It were curious\r\nto let the imagination run over the fact that the hosts of these\r\nuncommended gems died ages before the advent of man. The best of modern\r\nprizes may be puny in comparison with those which caused distress to\r\nthe giant molluscs of the age when the Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus, and\r\nPterodactylus were the aristocrats of the animal world. Such gems have\r\ngone for ever, and even during this age of insatiable and adventurous\r\nsearch man does not secure a tithe of the ocean's tribute, for, since a\r\npearl is a source of discomfort to its host, the unceasing effort of\r\nthe animal is towards expulsion. The greatest and possibly the most\r\nmagnificent are cast out as rubbish on the ocean floor, or are retained\r\nwithin the valves when the animal dies of old age.\r\n\r\nSo-called pearls have been found in elephants' tusks and semi-adherent\r\nto the bones of fish, and concretions--hard, smooth, and round, and\r\nof the flat hue of skimmed milk--in coconuts and in the cavities of\r\nbamboos; but in the production of the real gem neither oyster nor mussel\r\nnor pinna need fear the rivalry of anything on the earth's surface. The\r\npearl belongs to the sea.\r\n\r\nCompletely spherical pearls can be formed only loose in the mantle or\r\nsoft parts of the body of the animal; but intrusions incite a deposit\r\nof nacre in the form of a projection on the interior, which projection,\r\noften a mere bubble, but sometimes semi-detached, may take the shape and\r\ndimensions of the foreign substance. Or an inoffensive mollusc may be\r\ngoaded by the piercing of its shell from the exterior to create that\r\nfor which men venture into the depths of the sea. If a pearl-secreting\r\noyster be inherently robust, its defence against assault from without\r\nmay consist of the strengthening of the interior at the point of attack\r\nby deposits of nacre. Thus, a slight protuberance arises which becomes\r\nthe base of a blister or button or the starting-point of a pear-shaped\r\ngem. Many a lovely gem is, therefore, nothing more than the imperishable\r\nrecord of aggression on the part of a flabby sponge on a resourceful\r\noyster. Occasionally valuable pearls are found within huge blisters.\r\nSuch pearls originate, no doubt, in the ordinary way, but, becoming\r\nan intolerable nuisance on account of increasing size, are confined in\r\nnacre.\r\n\r\nOne of the accompanying illustrations shows the fate which befell\r\nan infant chiton upon intrusion on a small black-lip oyster, and\r\ncoincidentally the origin of a blister. The chiton family being\r\nnotorious for stolidity, the infant could not have realised the risks of\r\nits trespass until the strait-jacket made its retirement impossible.\r\nThe nacre has reproduced the details of the chiton's exterior with the\r\nfidelity of a casting, and further reveals the fact that it was alive\r\nwhen entombed, for its struggles to escape are solidified.\r\n\r\nThis deliberate act of the oyster may not stand comparison with the\r\nstone of Pyrrhus's ring, which had the figure of Apollo and the nine\r\nMuses in the veins of it produced by the spontaneous handiwork of Nature\r\nwithout any help from art. The marvellous stone belonged to the fabulous\r\npast; the imprisoned chiton to the prosaic present.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration is that of an accumulation of nacre which has\r\nassumed accidental resemblance to a miniature shark. It was found in a\r\ngold-lip pearl shell in Torres Straits. The like quantity in globular\r\nshape would represent a pearl of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEARL IN THE MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a calm and luminous day I waded, disrobed, in shallow water as limpid\r\nas the fictitious stream which legend says King Solomon improvised\r\nat the foot of his throne when the Queen of Sheba attended his court.\r\nLifting her robes--for she imagined the crossing of the water to be a\r\nceremonial device--the gorgeous Queen displayed her shapely calves. The\r\nwater resting on the verge of the lovely Isle was as delusively clear,\r\nbut was not deceptive.\r\n\r\nIt revealed living coral, good to avoid by the barefooted; clams with\r\npatterned mantles of various tints--grey, slate-blue, sea-green, brown,\r\nand buff; anemones in many shapes, some like spikes of lavender,\r\nand irritant and repellent to the touch; some platter-shaped and\r\ncobalt-blue; some as living vases with the opalescent tints of Venetian\r\nglass, which, abhorring the hand of man, retreat into the sand until\r\nonly an inconspicuous fringe of neutral tint is visible. Sea-slugs\r\nin almost endless form and variety of hue, and many other strange sea\r\nthings, were among the inhabitants of the reef--a closely packed arena\r\nof never-ceasing slaughter.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a clump of brown seaweed, which had fallen apart like\r\nthe neatly dressed hair of a woman, was a black streak, signifying the\r\ngape of a wedge-shaped mollusc known as a pinna. The gape was about as\r\nlong as the parting of a woman's hair and about thrice as wide. As I\r\ncrouched to note the functions of the animal, my shadow intervened and\r\nthe caution of the creature was roused, the valves closing so that no\r\nsign of the presence of the shell was distinguishable among the slightly\r\nwavering, minute particles of alga. Changing my position, so that the\r\npinna might not be deprived of its share of the rays of the sun, the\r\nvalves soon furtively opened. A slight movement on my part and they\r\nclosed again, without having revealed any hidden charms.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, a certain confidence being established between us,\r\nthe pinna emerged from its retirement, in so far as such creatures are\r\npermitted by Nature. The mantle of this particular species is shown as\r\na delicate fringe of lace in old gold and black. It ripples along the\r\nupper edges of the confining valves, which are intensely black with a\r\npearly lustre. The pretty movements of the mantle--like the swinging\r\nof the skirts of a well-apparelled damsel--attracted admiration, and on\r\npeering into the shell a glimpse of something precious was obtained.\r\n\r\nTossed and twirled about just below the old gold fringe was a black\r\npearl about the size of a pea. The prize was safe. Without risk of loss\r\nit could be watched in its unceasing revolutions. It seemed as if the\r\nanimal, with automatic perseverance, attempted to eject the incubus, the\r\nweight of which kept it about an inch below the aperture of the valves.\r\nSuch motion would naturally tend to perfection. Whatsoever its lustre,\r\nit would certainly be a sphere. Besides, it was a pearl in the making.\r\nAs long as it remained within the pinna and it could not be voluntarily\r\nrejected, its size would inevitably increase. It was the rolling stone\r\nto which time and the secretions of the animal would add weight and,\r\nperadventure, beauty.\r\n\r\nWas mortal ever before privileged to watch over the growth of a black\r\npearl? The activities of the mantle, a blending of enticing colour\r\nand poetic motion, were slow, free, and light-attracting. The ancients\r\nbelieved that some pearls were constituted by flashes of lightning\r\nplaying on bubbles within the oyster. A relative of the family here\r\nseemed to be wooing the tropic sun of its beams, if not to vitalise, at\r\nleast to burnish its treasure.\r\n\r\nClose scrutiny showed that the pearl was not absolutely free. It was\r\nenclosed in a transparent membrane, the merest film, which confined\r\nit to a particular position in the mantle, while it seemed to possess\r\nindependent actions--vertical and revolutionary. Perhaps the rays of\r\nlight which fell unequally on it through the water created the illusion\r\nof revolutions, but it is certain that the pearl seemed to be playing a\r\ngame of hide-and-seek.\r\n\r\nWas it possible for human nature to deny itself so easily gotten\r\nand pretty a prize? I confess, though the possibility of the pearl\r\nincreasing in size and loveliness was obvious, that the fact that pinnas\r\nare subject to ills, chances, and mishaps, was also recognised. Left to\r\nbe slowly tossed about, the pearl would become greater; but size, though\r\nan important feature, is not the only desirable quality. And while it\r\ngrew might not another barefooted beach-comber discover it? Or might not\r\none of the many unintelligent admirers of the pinna itself find entrance\r\nby drilling or by the violent crushing of the valves, and, ignoring the\r\ntreasure, destroy the organs and the substance by and from which it\r\nwas being delicately elaborated? Suppose, I argued, I remove the gaping\r\nshell, I shall no longer be able to enjoy the rare, the unique pleasure\r\nof presiding over the gradual perfection of a pearl, an aesthetic\r\nadvantage to which I alone had been made free. Could present possession\r\nof a little sphere of carbonate of lime, polished and sooty black,\r\ncompensate for the continuance of the chaste joy of watching one of the\r\nmost covert and intimate processes of Nature? Balancing the immediate\r\nmaterial gain against the inevitable moral loss, I was almost persuaded\r\nto self-denial, when, with a sudden impulse, begot of the consciousness\r\nof rightful acquisition, the pinna was forcibly yet carefully drawn out\r\nof the sand in which it was deeply embedded and in which it was anchored\r\nby toughened byssus. Directly the valves were prised apart the pearl\r\nfell into my hand. Never before had I seen one so loosely retained\r\nwithin its shell. Generally, in the case of the pinna, pearls\r\nare embedded in the muscles or soft parts, and are not primarily\r\ndiscernible, but have to be sought for by passing the “meat” through\r\nthe fingers. On this occasion all previous experience had been set at\r\nnaught, so that it might seem that the prize had been presented by the\r\nanimal as its perfect and most opulent work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE PEARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engaging theory of the ancients that pearls were made of glutinous\r\ndewdrops condensed by the sun's heat does not take into account the\r\nfact that some of the rarest, though not the most valuable, have assumed\r\ncontrary and fantastic shape. Fish, crabs, and marine insects have\r\nproved a common origin of pearly developments while they have been\r\nregarded by some as almost miraculous conceptions on the part of the\r\nafflicted mollusc.\r\n\r\nHamed of Jeddah, the stubby Arab who deals in fish and oysters, and who\r\nprofesses to have groped over in his youth a considerable extent of\r\nthe Red Sea for coral and pearls, relates many experiences in which\r\nthe popular gem takes pride of place. Oriental that he is, he loves\r\nexaggeration, and while lending a propitious car to the stories in which\r\nhe enshrines his prime, when he could dive deep and long, and when the\r\nprecious red coral was “thick” and every shell contained a pearl, it is\r\ndiscreet to disregard obvious breaks and bulges along the prim path of\r\ntruth. The very crudeness of his embellishments invests with kind of\r\ncomic relief some of his fables, which end invariably with insipid\r\nuniformity. All the pearls which have slipped through Hamed's rough\r\nhands have been valued at five hundred pounds, never more or less. It is\r\nnot for me to rub the gilt off the innocent inventions of the emotional\r\nArab, but merely to relate one of his time-beguiling tales, and one\r\nwhich, probably, is of clean-cut truth.\r\n\r\nA huge gold-lip, found four fathoms deep, where the sea grass sways\r\nindolently long, contained a tinted pearl like:\r\n\r\n“That fella sitting down along a tree and sing out along night time.”\r\n\r\n“Flying fox?” I guessed grimly.\r\n\r\n“No!” snapped Hamed indignantly. “'Nother fella.”\r\n\r\n“That bird which says 'chump, chump, chump?'” I meekly asked.\r\n\r\nAgain Hamed sneered ironically. “No bird. No bird carn get along oyster.\r\nLittle fella-green like leaf. Sing out 'Ko-rog, ko-rog, ko-rog!'”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Frog!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Like frog. Me call him 'ghouk' along my country. That fella inside\r\ngold-lip. One inch long. Leg, hand, mouth, eyes all asame. I bin get\r\nfive hundred pounds for that fella.”\r\n\r\nAzure pearls in the similitude of tiny fish can be vouched for by people\r\nfar more careful of their facts than Hamed--fish which have intruded\r\nthemselves on the oysters and have been encased in nacre. Probably the\r\nrarity which fell into Hamed's hands was the pearly presentment of a\r\ncrustacean, for marine frogs are infinitely rarer than pearls. Several\r\nmolluscs admit tenants, one particular species a rotund crab; but in\r\nthe case in point the wrong mansion was entered and, so to speak, the\r\nobtruder was transformed.\r\n\r\nA common and neat industry in China is the production of fraudulent\r\npearls, pretty and in accordance with submitted design, in which the\r\nco-operation of the obedient but frail mussel is necessary. If a round\r\npearl is desired, a naked shot is introduced between the valves so much\r\nto the discomfort of the animal that it proceeds to cover it decently\r\nwith layer after layer of pearl-film, the bulk of which depends upon\r\nthe length of life granted to the mussel. Sometimes little josses are\r\nstamped out in thin uncorrosive metal, which, being presented to the\r\nmussel, are faithfully modelled, the thrifty Chinese obtaining in course\r\nof time quaint pearly gods--as potent as the best--without money and\r\nwithout price.\r\n\r\nNot so long as a quarter of a century ago a spirit-bottle full\r\nof pearls--buttons, blisters, and chips of all sorts, sizes, and\r\nshapes--was purchased in North Queensland by one who had but the crudest\r\nideas as to the value of such gems. The vendor was a whity-brown man,\r\nthin, and thinly clad in cotton. The complexion of the buyer was ruddier\r\nthan the cherry, for the tropic sun had beamed ardently on his peachy\r\nScotch skin, proclaiming him a new-chum, a bright and shining new-chum.\r\nBecause he was new he was alert to the value of money. Had he not come,\r\nas all new-chums do, to Tom Tiddler's ground to pick up gold and silver?\r\nHence, when the hatless, spare, whity-brown man in soiled cotton offered\r\nfor sale the odd-shaped beads in a besmeared whisky-bottle for five\r\npounds, his national trait expressed itself in a scoff.\r\n\r\nThe whity-brown man's seriousness, his confidentiality, his keen\r\ndesire to sell, his mysticism and misty English, the ruddy young man\r\ninterpreted as manifestations of the arts and wiles by means of which\r\ninnocent strangers from far away lands are tempted into bankruptcy\r\nbargains. The seller, anxious to dispossess himself of ill-gotten gains\r\nprejudicial to his love of liberty, pursued the Scotch youth almost\r\ntearfully, until the bottle changed hands, but at a considerable\r\nreduction on the price originally demanded. Shortly after a friend\r\nenlightened the youth as to the probable value of the collection, and\r\ngave him some cheap advice, especially on the desirableness of secrecy.\r\nThe youth accepted the advice so literally that the story ends. No one\r\never knew how, when, where, and for what consideration, he disposed of\r\nhis embarrassments. Fresh from the land of his birth, and with the text\r\nof Burns's poetic letter in his mind, he kept that something to himself.\r\n\r\nThe days of such sensational deals are past. The primal crop has long\r\nsince been harvested. Science is now bidden to stimulate the docile\r\noyster, for the rage for pearls is as the rage of the heathen. Is it\r\nnot the wish of every woman, old and young, to possess pearls? And while\r\nsubject man, flushed with hope, ventures to the “utmost port, washed by\r\nthe furthest sea,” for such merchandise at the caprice of woman, Science\r\nplods sedately after man, beguiling him with the hope of some less risky\r\nand laborious means of acquiring the gems, while at the same time\r\nshe soothes the irrepressible passion of every damsel with strings of\r\nartistic counterfeits manufactured from the scales of silvery fish, and\r\nas pleasant to glance at as many an orient.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards say that a paper cigarette, a glass of water, and the kiss\r\nof a pretty girl, will sustain a man for a day without eating. But what\r\nis a man to do who has no tobacco, only stale water, who is separated\r\nfrom the nearest girl by seventy miles of perilous seas forlorn, and\r\nwhose appetite sickens at the sight of the coarse fare of a béche-de-mer\r\nboat? There is but one resource for such a martyr. He must do “a\r\nperisher.” That is precisely what the master of a lonely boat in an\r\nodd angle of the Coral Sea was doing when a joyful sail appeared--a\r\ndove-like messenger from civilisation and shops. It was a pitiable\r\nfamine. No one had had a smoke for a week. The black boys had broken\r\nup their nicotine-saturated clay pipes and masticated them to pulp, and\r\nstill treasured the quids, while the “Boss” pondered cigars during the\r\nday and dreamt them at night. But relief was at hand. The master of the\r\nstrange craft, though well stocked, was not disposed to be generous,\r\nuntil tempted by the sight of a lovely yellow pearl, about the size of a\r\nsmall marble and of satiny lustre--sweet to look upon, sweeter still\r\nto possess. Aware of the other man's agonising needs, he drove a hard\r\nbargain, and the gem became his at the cost of a box of tobacco. He\r\nhugged himself for joy, and after a decent lapse, during which he acted\r\nthe part of the virtuous who had relieved another's necessities out of\r\nsheer goodwill (for the pearl was only a curio, was it not?), he set\r\nsail for the nearest port.\r\n\r\nCertain that fortune had at last beamed upon him, he laid up his lugger,\r\nwound up his affairs, and hurried off to Sydney, secretly, to dispose\r\nof his prize first-hand. An expert weighed the treasure, scrutinised it\r\nshrewdly through a microscope, and handed it back with a casual remark\r\nthat it was a pretty curio, but that its market value was about half a\r\ncrown. “It has been exposed to great heat, and may crumble to pieces at\r\na change of temperature. Get me one like that uncooked and I'll give you\r\ntwelve hundred pounds.”\r\n\r\nSome time after, the grasping man discovered that the pearl had been\r\nfound in the “meat” of a “helmet” shell which had been roasted by a\r\nhungry and tobaccoless boy.\r\n\r\nWithout appearing to suggest anything beyond a trifling blemish in this\r\nstory, replete as it is with edifying illustrations of the frailties of\r\nhuman nature, it would be well to remember that the helmet shell (CASSIS\r\nFLAMMEA) is not nacreous and could not therefore produce a true pearl,\r\nbut merely g porcellaneous concretion, which, however, might possess a\r\nmost attractive tint, possibly pale salmon or orange. Such a gem might\r\nbe valuable.\r\n\r\nGreat pearls are not generally found on shallow reefs. He who would\r\nsearch for them systematically must dive, and if he does not possess the\r\nproper costume and accessories his trips below are but brief, and not\r\nalways profitable. When a diver boasts that he can remain under water\r\ntwo or three minutes--and the boast is very common--he has gauged his\r\nendurance by his sensations, not by the clock. Once an expert was timed,\r\na coloured gentleman who had great repute among his companions, all\r\ncapable divers. He made a special and supreme effort, and though the\r\nwatch recorded barely seventy seconds, he was much distressed. Recovery\r\nwas, however, speedy; of ten subsequent minutes he spent more than\r\nhalf out of sight. It is not argued that human beings cannot remain\r\nvoluntarily under water more than seventy seconds, but the feat is so\r\nrare that those who accomplish it are not usually pearl-divers.\r\n\r\nThe natives of some parts of Borneo declare that the valves of the\r\noysters containing the largest pearls are always open, and that by\r\npeering into the water the pearls may be seen. They tell a story of a\r\ngigantic pearl which was thus discovered by the men of old and actually\r\nbrought while within the oyster into a canoe, but had slipped from the\r\nfingers of a careless holder into deep water.\r\n\r\nSpencer St. John, author of “Life in the Forests of the Far East,” had\r\namong his friends a chief who ventured most of his possessions in a\r\npearling cruise. Disaster attended the enterprise, but without subduing\r\nhis faith in luck; mortgaging everything, even to his wife and child, he\r\nwent out to woo fortune again. His slave-boy was preparing to dive one\r\nday when he started back, touched his master's hand, and with signs of\r\ngreat emotion pointed into the water. The chief looked, and there, seven\r\nfathoms below, lay an oyster with an enormous pearl distinctly visible.\r\nWithout a moment's reflection he plunged in, and, diving with skill\r\nand speed, reached the shell before it closed, his fingers being caught\r\nbetween the valves. He quickly rose to the surface, and was helped into\r\nthe boat by his anxious follower. Upon the oyster being forced open, a\r\npearl, unsurpassed in size and of extraordinary beauty, was revealed.\r\nReturning to his native village, the chief sold all his smaller pearls,\r\nand having redeemed his wife and child, set sail for Manila, where lived\r\nan English friend who advanced him money, to whom he said: “Take this\r\npearl, clear off my debt, give me what you like in return. I shall be\r\nsatisfied.” The author adds: “The merchant took the pearl, gave him what\r\nhe considered its value--at all events enough to make Sulu ring with\r\nhis generosity--and sent the pearl to China; but what became of it\r\nafterwards I could never distinctly trace; but I learned that a pearl in\r\nBengal called 'The Mermaid' originally came from China, and as the one\r\nfound in Sulu was said to be shaped like a woman's bust, it is probably\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly the golden age of the pearl is passing as the golden age of the\r\nreptile has passed, for can it not be imagined that, in those far-back\r\ndays when oysters attained a length of two feet and better deserved\r\nthe title of Tridacna (three bites) than the present clams, pearls\r\nof corresponding magnificence of size were produced? Or are robust\r\npearlless oysters to be accepted as the type of the strong era, and\r\nsmall oysters and pearls merely as signs of degeneracy? The largest of\r\nmodern pearls measured two inches long by a circumference of four inches\r\nand weighed eighteen hundred grains. The containing shell may have been\r\nbig only in comparison with its contemporaries. A very small man has\r\nbeen known to be afflicted with a disproportioned goitre, and there are\r\nsome who argue that the goitre may be but the prototype of the pearl.\r\n\r\nIs fact or fable to claim the most glorious of pearl stories? Some\r\nverily believe that Cleopatra did quaff the costliest beverage the world\r\nhas ever known. The incident is so faithful to the character of “that\r\nrare Egyptian” that all sober record shall not discount delight in its\r\ntranscendent sumptuousness. Though the pearl may have been worth eighty\r\nthousand pounds of our money, though Cleopatra was gay, though her\r\nextravagance was impious, she was a glorious woman, and she had at least\r\none glorious, if nauseating, drink. The pearl decoction was merely an\r\nepisode in her policy, which was to fascinate Antony--Antony who had\r\ncalled her to account for having aided his enemies in their war against\r\nhim. And what was an eighty thousand pound bauble in the high affairs\r\nof State? “She was at the age when a woman's beauty is at its prime, and\r\nshe was also of the best judgment. So she furnished herself with a world\r\nof gifts, stores of gold and silver, and of riches and other sumptuous\r\nornaments as is credible she might bring from so great a house and from\r\nso wealthy and rich a realm as Egypt. But yet she carried nothing\r\nwith her wherein she trusted more than herself, and in the charms and\r\nenchantment of her surpassing beauty and grace.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the supper following the magnificent pageant! Anything less\r\nthan an eighty thousand pound pearl would have been an anti-climax, a\r\nmean and clumsy culmination of a “gaudy night.” That soul-delighting gem\r\nwhich vanished in foam told of a superb Cleopatra's “calm felicity and\r\npower.”\r\n\r\nSome say that, the jewel--cast away so majestically was one of a pair\r\nwhich Cleopatra wore as ear-rings, and that when Antony restrained\r\nhis hostess from a repetition of the draught, she presented the now\r\nmatchless pearl to him. Another version implies that the ear-ring had\r\nbeen originally one monster pearl, which Cleopatra had caused to be sawn\r\nin two to gratify her lust for unique and lavish ornament.\r\n\r\nIt is said, too, that the pearl was dissolved in wine. By a simple\r\npractical test and at the sacrifice of a small quantity of baroque,\r\nproof was obtained that ordinary culinary vinegar is a solvent of\r\npearls. The experiment also yielded these notable conclusions--that\r\neither the wine of Cleopatra's age was much more corrosive than the\r\nvinegar of ours, or that the costly beverage was prepared beforehand,\r\nor that the stately banquet was long-drawn-out while the inestimable gem\r\nspluttered and simmered in the goblet. The dissolution of such a large\r\npearl must have been slow, and the product far from nice, but it was one\r\nof the effects by which a sovereign woman conquered the “most courteous\r\nlord” of his day.\r\n\r\nA curious superstition prevails in some parts of the East Indies, it\r\nbeing believed that if gold and pearls are placed by themselves in a\r\npacket they will certainly decrease in quantity or number, and in the\r\nend totally disappear; but, if a few grains of rice are added, the\r\ntreasure is safe. Rice is thought not only to preserve the original\r\nnumber of pearls, but to actually cause increase.\r\n\r\nTarnished pearls are occasionally submitted to the process of\r\n“skinning”--the removal with fine steel files under a magnifying\r\nglass of the outer 'layer, on the chance of the existence of a better\r\nunderneath. The ancients treated lustreless gems differently, placing\r\nthem before doves, under the belief that they could be polished by being\r\npecked and played with by the gentle birds.\r\n\r\nIn some respects pearls are superior to all other gems. They are\r\nemblematic of serenity, and serenity is often power in the highest\r\nmanifestation. None ever said an unkind word of pearls; no dubious\r\nlegend clings to them, making the timid afraid. They come to us\r\nperfectly fashioned. No coarse handiwork has touched them, no soulless\r\nmachine ground them to conventional pattern. The last diamond may be,\r\nthe last pearl never, until the sea gives up more than its dead, its\r\nvery being. Pearls may begin and end in foam; but the beginning is now\r\nand always, and the ending rare, for the Cleopatras are gone. Emblems\r\nof purity, refinement, and peace, they are truly the gems for woman.\r\nQueenly or demure, they become her, and she bestows on them a quality\r\nhard to define, but singularly sweet and acceptable. Gold and precious\r\nstones may occupy billions of years in the making, or may be the product\r\nof--\r\n\r\n\r\n        “The war of elements,\r\n    The wrecks of matter, and the crash of worlds.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we find these hard, cold things and take hold of and seize them, we\r\nknow that we have, to use a homely simile, eaten our cake. The supply\r\nof pearls is continuous, and under the control of the cruel ingenuity of\r\nman they grow to an ordinary size in less than a decade.\r\n\r\nMany years ago an opinion was expressed that the increasing knowledge\r\n'of the mollusc and its habits would enable man literally to sow the sea\r\nwith pearls as he sows a field with grain, and that the harvest would\r\nbe certain. Under natural conditions not one oyster in a hundred is\r\ntroubled with a pearl, and not one pearl in the hundred is of any real\r\nvalue. It is demanded that unsuspecting oysters shall be inflicted with\r\na kind of plague, so that there shall be not one but several pearls\r\nin every suffering individual, and in the greater number chance\r\nwill contrive a larger proportion of orients. Every oyster has\r\nits potentialities; Science seeks to convert potentialities into\r\ncertainties.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS AND HIGH TRAGEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch merchandise has ever provoked the spirit of adventure in hardy,\r\nhealthy men, and pearls have claimed the lives of the best among them.\r\nThe health and figure of the friend who beguiled many an evening were\r\nsacrificed to the lustrous gem so prized of women. A model of stalwart\r\nmanhood of the Viking strain, he died early, worn out with the stress\r\nwith which he sought the most serene of personal adornments. There may\r\nhave been some slight exaggeration in the popular belief that he had\r\nwalked along the bottom of the sea from one end of the Great Barrier\r\nReef to the other, a stretch of over one thousand miles; but that he had\r\naccomplished more than that distance in the aggregate of his submarine\r\nwanderings may be quite credible. Probably there was no human being who\r\npossessed such intimate knowledge of the character of the ocean floor\r\nwithin the living bounds of the Great Barrier; and since he was silent,\r\nreserved, and self-contained to all save friends of long standing, was\r\nnever guilty of boasting, and ever reluctant to tell of his adventures,\r\nthe world is little the wiser from his work, though at the best time\r\nof his life most of his days were spent under water in fairyland-like\r\nscenes. It may seem absurd to associate fairyland with the depths of the\r\nsea; but the shy explorer of many a coral grove has been heard to say\r\nthat the scenes fulfilled his ideals of what the realms of the fairies\r\nmight be like.\r\n\r\nPearl-divers are more susceptible to the charms of wayward Fortune than\r\nthose who have not realised the thrill of expectancy with which a huge\r\ngoldlip, encrusted with coral and swathed with seaweed, is seized. It\r\nmay contain a gem worth a king's ransom, or but an animal which, though\r\nit may be crossed in love, is not engaging in appearance or in any\r\nfeature or quality commendable. There is the chance; and it appeals\r\nto most rational men. Secretive Fortune lures on, promising the bubble\r\npearl 'and proffering that which satisfieth not, until the stress and\r\nperils of the avocation tell on the enthusiast, who finds himself not\r\nexuberant as wont; that Fortune has been tricking him; that in the\r\npursuit of pearls Chance is oft repellent; and that the prize which\r\nseemed impossible to avoid has eluded the most devoted seekers.\r\n\r\nIt may be that my captain did not seek his pearls with zeal beyond that\r\nwhich is common to the calling the world over; but that his enthusiasm\r\nbeguiled him into remote and odd parts of the Barrier, that he became\r\nfamiliar with rare scenes (denied to all save submarine adventurers\r\nin tropical waters), that he was oft in peril of his life, and that he\r\ncould pause in the midst of strenuous, nerve-racking work to watch\r\nthe never-ceasing hostilities of the denizens of the sea, may not be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nNot long before he passed away he told of one of his adventures in a\r\nfew hurried words, after the manner of one who loves not to dwell on\r\npersonal reminiscences, save as a text for the rectification of popular\r\nerror in respect of sensational happenings. The story is here repeated,\r\nfor it throws light on an incident which sent one ship of warfare on\r\ndubious patrol, and reveals the manner of the men who sought pearls in\r\nthe old days.\r\n\r\n“Have you found that pearl?” he asked smilingly; for we had often talked\r\nof the possibility of being rewarded with a fortune-bestowing gem.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I have; and a real beauty. I very much doubt if you, for\r\nall your experience, ever saw such perfect shape and fine lustre. Here\r\nis an instance of the perversity of Chance. You, tied up in a rubber\r\nbag, rake the floor of the Barrier, fighting sharks and being hustled\r\nby turtle, and never find anything out of the way. I stroll about the\r\nbeaches, and see what Fortune bestows!”\r\n\r\nThe size of a small marble, it lay swathed in white wadding. Minute\r\nfurrows sculptured the surface in radiating lines from pole to pole,\r\nenhancing rare radiance.\r\n\r\nThe captain took the little casket in his hand that he might gloat over\r\nthe treasure, as, his eyes shining, he said:\r\n\r\n“You lucky fellow! Where did you get it? I never saw a finer pearl, and\r\nI have seen a few in my days. Fair numbers have passed through my hands;\r\nbut--you fraud!”\r\n\r\nHe lifted it, revealing a counterfeit, which had once ornamented a\r\nhatpin.\r\n\r\nIn good-humour he settled down on a lounge and gradually drifted into\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\n“About two years before what I am going to tell you happened, I heard\r\nof a patch of shell off an island Sud-Est way; I kept the tip to myself,\r\ndetermined to work the spot on my own account if ever I got the chance.\r\nI waited till I saved a few pounds, and, taking in a mate, fitted out a\r\ncraft, and with a crew of very fair boys sailed away. I found the spot\r\nall right; but--my usual luck--someone had been there before me. Strange\r\nto say, the spot was by no means worked out, though it was fairly good\r\nground and easy working, and the shell large. We did good business for\r\na while, until one day I got a proper start. The life-line fouled on\r\nsomething, and I found that it had taken a turn round the bowsprit of a\r\nwreck. I got on top pretty quick, and, having had a talk with my mate,\r\nwent down again. Very soon I knew the boat. It was the ----, and she\r\nhad belonged to a man I had known very well. The strange part about the\r\nbusiness was that the boat had been burned. Her deck was gone; she had\r\nburned to the water's edge and had sunk, and there she rested on her\r\nkeel. I knew that the owner had left port some months before on a secret\r\ncruise. Someone must have given him the tip, too. He was well known and\r\nliked, and generally did good business. My mate and I talked over the\r\nbusiness. We wanted to clean up that patch, so decided to remain a few\r\ndays longer before clearing out to report. I was convinced that murder\r\nhad been committed-that the natives of the island had massacred the\r\nparty and had sunk the lugger.\r\n\r\n“While I was below next day an urgent message came down. I bobbed up\r\npretty quickly. A boat was sneaking out from the beach, apparently with\r\nthe plan of cutting us off from our lugger, which was anchored some\r\ndistance off, with only a couple of boys on board. You bet, we got up\r\nsteam pretty quickly. When we got on board we reached for our rifles,\r\nand then felt safe.\r\n\r\n“The boat was then making straight for us, and it appeared to be crowded\r\nwith darkies. We had been off the island for four days, and had not seen\r\nthe sight of a native. I knew there were plenty, and the fact that they\r\nhad kept away had made me a bit suspicious. As the boat came along I\r\nwas sure they meant mischief, and was determined, no matter how friendly\r\nthey wanted to be, not to let one of the beggars on deck.\r\n\r\n“About half a mile away we saw one of them, who appeared to be a bit\r\nlighter in colour than the rest, stand up in the bow and wave a kind\r\nof message. He kept one arm going like a semaphore. Then we saw that\r\nhe carried under the other arm a basket--a peace-offering of yams and\r\nfruit, no doubt. He had only a shirt on, and still he kept his right\r\narm working. When he got within hailing distance, the man in the bows\r\nshouted my name. He was a brawny chap. I thought to myself that if it\r\ncame to a row I would pot him first, for he was ringleader.\r\n\r\n“All the rest were naked. His scanty uniform marked him out. Probably\r\nhe got that shirt from the owner of the sunken lugger. I wetted my lips\r\nwith my tongue as I thought it might be my duty to wipe him out. Then my\r\nname was shouted out again, and, recognising the voice, I discovered the\r\nman in the shirt to be a well-known character who goes under the name of\r\n----.\r\n\r\n“I've got something nice for you, captain! Don't look so nasty with that\r\nrifle to an old friend!'\r\n\r\n“Still keeping our rifles ready, we let the boat come alongside and the\r\ntinted man passed up the basket, It was native-made, and all the top was\r\ncovered with green leaves. Thinking of fresh yams and fruit, I pulled\r\noff the leaves, and there--poof!--the head of a man-an old man who must\r\nhave died a violent death about two days before.\r\n\r\n“The man in the shirt laughed loud and long at the disgust in my face,\r\nand, coming on board, soon told of the tragedy of which the awful head\r\nwas a symbol of retaliation.\r\n\r\n“The owner of the sunken lugger had fitted her out with unusual care.\r\nHis crew consisted of natives of the island off which we were lying. As\r\na special inducement to one of the boys, whose name was Massai, he had\r\npromised a rifle, but designedly withheld the gift until towards the end\r\nof the term of agreement. Massai had persistently begged for the rifle,\r\nand it having become necessary for the Boss' to take a trip to the port,\r\nhe had definitely, promised to bring it with him. Again he designedly\r\nforgot. Massai became morose. Things went on calmly enough until one\r\nday, when the mate was below, the 'Boss' was suddenly thrown overboard.\r\nAs he floundered on the surface one of the boys struck at him with a\r\ntomahawk, and then he must have realised that his life was at stake.\r\n\r\n“Diving until well clear of the boat, he swam off to the lugger, about\r\na quarter of a mile away. As his master came up, Massai leaned over the\r\nside, his master's rifle in his hand.\r\n\r\n“'Don't shoot me, Massai,' he shouted. 'I give you good rifle belonga\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n“Massai shouted back, 'Me catch 'em plenty riple! You no good!' and\r\nfired. The bullet splashed over the man's head. The next struck him fair\r\nin the forehead, and he sank.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime Massai's confederates were sporting with the diver,\r\nhauling him up to the surface, pumping sufficient air to keep him alive,\r\nshutting it off until he must have been nearly suffocated, reviving him\r\nwith fresh supplies, and with joy prolonging life until the fun of the\r\nthing ceased; then they had cut the pipe so that he might drown.\r\n\r\n“The lugger having been ransacked, she was fired, and she had sunk at\r\nher anchorage.\r\n\r\n“A few days after the man with the shirt arrived at the island, and\r\nsince these simple children of Nature cannot keep their doings to\r\nthemselves, he very soon was made a confidant, learning the whole\r\ndetails of the tragedy by pidgin English and expressive pantomime, and\r\nobtaining as proof the coat of the reckless man who had made a promise\r\nto Massai which, possibly, he had never intended to fulfil. The plot of\r\nthe revenge and murder had been hatched out ashore at the instigation of\r\nMassai's mother.\r\n\r\n“Fortified with full information, he sailed away to a neighbouring port,\r\nwhere he exhibited the coat of the murdered 'Boss.' Being impressed, the\r\nofficial representing the majesty of the law gave some vague commission\r\nto the man, who now wears other clothes than a shirt, and he sailed away\r\nfor ports unknown.\r\n\r\n“Interpreting his commission to make further inquiries very broadly,\r\nhe appeared off the island, and received a cordial welcome, for he was\r\n'Hail fellow well met' with the inhabitants of many a remote isle. He\r\nmade himself very friendly, and the frank natives rather gloried than\r\notherwise in the recitation of evidence which condemned them.\r\n\r\n“Then he made plans for unauthorised punishment. Having disarmed\r\nsuspicion--just as the boat's crew had done in the case of his\r\nfriend--he waited, and one dark night surrounded the village with a\r\nwell-armed, hostile force. These Papuan villages are fortified in a\r\ncertain sense. Some of the exits are set with traps and spring spears,\r\nand none but those in the secret dares venture along a track when the\r\nvillage has been made secure for the night.\r\n\r\n“The man with the shirt posted his forces so that the exits were\r\ncommanded, and waited for dawn, his instructions being that no\r\ndemonstration was to be made until he gave the signal. Before the\r\ndesigned time a shot was fired, and the conscience-stricken community\r\nfled, all save one old man and infant, who met their fate.\r\n\r\n“The village was spoiled and fired, and thus retributive justice done\r\nto those who had wantonly murdered two white men and destroyed their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n“Once again,” said the captain, “my luck was out. Goodness knows! There\r\nmight have been a big pearl in that patch. We didn't wait to find it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKE AND FROG PRATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Surely, then, it interests us to know the lot of other animal\r\ncreatures. However far below us, they are still the sole created things\r\nwhich share with us the capability of pleasure and the susceptibility to\r\npain.”--HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be edifying to confess a particular interest in man's first\r\nenemy-not such interest as the man of science displays when he seeks to\r\nadd to the knowledge of the world, but a kind of social concern. None\r\nof us is likely to forget that on the authority of Holy Writ the serpent\r\nbecame familiar with mankind very shortly after his appearance on earth,\r\nand whispered injurious secrets into guileless ears. Ever since the\r\nscene in the Garden of Eden, war between man and the serpent has\r\nprevailed, and now, if we are to credit the sayings of the wise, the end\r\nof all reptiles, if not actually in view, cannot be long postponed.\r\nIs it not mete, therefore, to take fair opportunity of studying the\r\ncharacteristics and qualities of an animal, closely associated with\r\nus by fable and in fact, which is doomed to extinction by the ruthless\r\nstrides of civilisation, which is regarded by some as cleanly and\r\ndecent, and by others as repulsive and direful? Plain, unromantic,\r\nunsensational statements make for the acquirement of knowledge\r\nillustrative of the habits and faculties of the creature against\r\nwhich the hand of the average man is raised with a mixture of wrath,\r\nvengeance, and fear.\r\n\r\nBy study and observation one may come to understand the higher\r\nprinciples of Nature, and so learn how to withstand influences inimical\r\nto his interests without upsetting laws which tend to his welfare.\r\n\r\nOccasionally quite casual happenings and bare and slight matters of fact\r\nshow that those who study natural history first-hand acquire information\r\nnot to be obtained from authoritative works. Let one instance concerning\r\nthe varied diet of the death adder be quoted, since it confounds the\r\nexperience of one of the most learned men in Australia on the subject.\r\nOn the beach just at high-water mark, beneath an overhanging shrub,\r\nseveral birds sounded an alarm, notifying by peculiar and persistent\r\nscreeching the presence of an enemy. After a few minutes' search, for\r\nthe strained attitudes of the birds indicated the direction, a death\r\nadder was seen gliding among thickly strewn brown leaves with a limp\r\nbird between its jaws. It was quickly killed, and then the bird, a dusky\r\nhoney-cater, was seen to be dead. Dusky honey-eaters generally spend\r\ntheir days among the topmost sprays of flowering trees and shrubs, while\r\ndeath adders habitually seek the seclusion of the shadiest places on the\r\nsurface of the soil. In this case the adder was small, so small that it\r\nseemed to be a vain if not impossible feat for it to swallow the bird.\r\n\r\nHitherto the food of the adder had been deemed to be frogs, lizards,\r\nbeetles, and such game of the ground. Was it curiosity which brought\r\nthe sun-loving bird within reach of the shade-loving snake? Upon the\r\nincident being referred to Mr. Dudley Le Souef, who has quite an uneasy\r\nfamiliarity with Australian snakes, dating from the days of ardent\r\nyouth, when he was wont to carry some species about with him in his\r\npockets, that authority wrote: “I did not know that death adders ever\r\nkilled birds; I did not think they were active enough, their usual\r\nprey being frogs, lizards, etc. The honey-eater must have been taken\r\nunawares.”\r\n\r\nThough scientifically regarded as “the most dangerous and probably the\r\nmost deadly” of Australian snakes, the death adder has to its credit\r\nmany everyday proofs to the contrary: so many, indeed, that some are\r\ninclined to class it as comparatively harmless, the reasons for such\r\nopinion being--(1) the small size of the creature, reducing the risks\r\nof its being interfered with inadvertently; (2) its amiability; (3) the\r\nfact that unless the sensitive membrane at the end of the tail, to which\r\nthe curved spine is the culminating-point, is trodden on or otherwise\r\ninsulted, the chances are that there will be, no active resentment.\r\nWhile adopting all precautions, accepting no risks, and being very eager\r\nto reduce the number by all and every possible means, it is well to\r\navoid overexcitement; for though the reptilian age is passing away,\r\nthose who live in the bush are too often reminded that snakes are still\r\nnumerous, and some of them decidedly vicious.\r\n\r\nTo disappoint the snake and at the same time to discredit its\r\nreputation, calmness on the part of the individual who may happen to be\r\nbitten is counselled. He should behave as a neighbour who one dark night\r\nstepped off his verandah barefooted on to nearly cleared land. As he\r\nstrode along the scarcely distinguishable track, he trod on something\r\nother than a half-burnt stick. Almost instantaneously the Scripture was\r\nfulfilled--the serpent had bruised the man's heel. Now, this man has\r\nbeen in many strange, not to say fear-provoking, situations, and has\r\nlistened to more than one close call without spoiling the occasion by\r\nanticipatory and hideous outcry. He does not smoke or drink whisky or\r\ngive way to any nerve-affecting habit. He lives within hearing of the\r\nsoothing lullaby of the sea. When his heel was gripped he did not\r\njump or offend the air with unmanly plaint and ineffectual clamour,\r\nor otherwise fluster his heart with pernicious apprehension. With calm\r\ndeliberation he put his hand into his pocket and drew forth--no! not a\r\nrazor-edged knife, with which to slash the region of the punctures, but\r\na box of matches, so that the scene might temporarily be surveyed. He\r\nsaw, not the expected death adder, not a deadly copper head, not the\r\nvenomous black which flattens and distends the neck like a cobra when\r\nits passions are roused, not the great red pugnacious beast which has\r\nbeen known to kill off-hand a big horse, but a shame-faced carpet snake,\r\nwhich, though innocent and inoffensive, will, like the worm, turn if\r\nrudely trodden on. The snake was quite ready to apologise for impulsive\r\nand graceless misbehaviour; but it seemed fascinated by the sudden\r\nlight--how little of brightness bewilders such lovers of darkness--and\r\nmaintained its repentant attitude until the sacred law was finally\r\nvindicated by the fatal bruising of its head.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a locality a few miles away suffered from a raid by bush\r\nrats, which congregated in great numbers. Similar plagues have often\r\nbeen recorded from the western downs; but the coastal visitation was\r\nsingular, for it was associated with death adders, which seemed to be on\r\ngood terms with the rats. One of the settlers was growing sweet-potatoes\r\non a fairly large scale for pig food, the plough being used for the\r\nharvesting of the crop. Seldom was a furrow run for the full length of\r\nthe field without turning up both adders and rats. Suddenly the rats\r\nmigrated, and then the death adders disappeared, few of either\r\nbeing seen for a decade, when the association between them was again\r\nsensationally illustrated. The daughter of a settler rose at dawn, and\r\nwith others ran off to the vegetable garden for salads for breakfast.\r\nWhile she was looking for a seemly cucumber, a rat was disturbed, and\r\nalmost immediately after she was bitten by a death adder which had lain\r\ninert at the very spot whence the rat had fled. The child recovered,\r\nwhile the deceptive snake, which will not submit to have its tail\r\nsaluted even by the airiest of treads, was killed. Not only have we here\r\nanother proof of the non-fatal character of the bite of an adder, but a\r\nsingular instance of association between an adder and a rat. Why and for\r\nwhat purpose does this apparent amicability exist?\r\n\r\nSometimes mankind is startled by the unexpected appearance of a snake.\r\nWill credit be given to an almost magic disappearance? Those who hearken\r\nto the voices of birds learn to discriminate between the language of\r\ncontent and happiness and love and that of dismay and terror. A number\r\nof loud and pleasant-noted fasciating honey-eaters suddenly changed\r\ntheir tune to that indicative of fear. They were, gathered on a\r\nthick-leaved tree on the edge of the jungle in a crude circle, with\r\nheads pointing to a common centre. It was simplicity to conclude that\r\na snake was present, but not at all easy to see it, for the flustered\r\nbirds began to change their manoeuvres directly help was at hand.\r\nEventually a thin brown snake was seen doubled up and apparently sound\r\nasleep among the branchlets The gun was called for, and two others\r\nhastened to the scene, each of whom distinctly saw the snake. When the\r\nshot was fired, a peephole was made through dense leafage just where the\r\nsnake had reposed, but with the report it had 'disappeared. Fragments\r\nof twigs and leaves came to Mother Earth, but even a smart black tracker\r\nfailed to find a trace of the snake, though the force of the explosion\r\nmust have carried portions out into the open. The point of this artless\r\nnarrative is that the black boy formed the firm opinion that that which\r\nhe and two others had concluded to be a snake must have been “'Nother\r\nkind. Him no good. Close up 'debil-debil!'” To him a visible snake was\r\nquite commonplace; but one that vanished under the impulse of a charge\r\nof shot represented a mystery which called for caution and hasty\r\ndeparture, and the boy strode away with the suggestion of hot bricks\r\nbelow. But the tell-tale birds, suspicious of the material only,\r\nreturned, stared at the vacancy, and fluttered off with--was it?--a note\r\nof thankfulness.\r\n\r\nThe serpent has one infallible, perhaps because it is automatic, regard\r\nfor its own comfort and well-being--it cannot be induced to tie itself\r\ninto a knot. It is in mind that once in the old country a very long\r\nand very cold lethargic boa constrictor became benumbed and forgot the\r\nprimal instinct of the family, and paid for its absent-mindedness\r\nwith its life. But the ordinary snake under extraordinary conditions,\r\nwhatsoever its length, is most careful to disentangle itself even when\r\nknots are designed for the special purpose of embarrassing it. Though\r\nthe head of a snake be battered until all apparent sense is obliterated,\r\nthe lithe body will cleverly evade attempts to cause it to disregard the\r\ngreat law. However tight the corner into which it may squeeze or narrow\r\nthe quarters into which it may be driven, and though head and tail may\r\nbe close together and in the midst of a complication of coils, and the\r\ntwisting and writhing may appear to be without method, yet the snake\r\nemerges a triumph of single purpose.\r\n\r\nA complication was presented to a 6 foot 8 inch specimen, and truth bids\r\nme say that the snake did not seem in the least bewildered. From a nest\r\nof eggs six had disappeared in one night. The loss was debited to a\r\nsnake, and it being calculated that the meal would suffice for several\r\ndays, no particular zeal was displayed in tracing out the thief.\r\nExperience has taught that snakes do not wander very far when good and\r\nnutritious food is to be obtained by intrusion on the cosy quarters of a\r\npet hen., Three days were permitted to pass, and then in the nest a rat\r\ntrap was placed baited with two eggs, the door being secured with\r\nwire. The bait proved to be irresistible and the trap effective. In\r\nthe morning the trap was crowded with snake, which had thrust its head\r\nbetween the wires, swallowed the eggs, and was a prisoner until they\r\nwere dissolved by the processes of digestion or the door was unbolted.\r\nThe natural process was not complete when the discovery was made, but\r\nthe snake had managed to make itself as comfortable as possible in its\r\ntemporary habitation. The trap seemed almost suffocatingly full, and\r\nwhen the occupant thrust its head and more than half its length between\r\nthe bars, only to be checked by the hard-hearted eggs, it was thought\r\nthat possibly, in its confusion, the snake might entangle itself; but\r\ninvariably it retired into the trap without putting itself into any\r\nfalse position. It was killed, the executioner justly reflecting that a\r\nsnake has mental limitations. Nothing could induce it to tie itself into\r\na knot, and yet, wilfully and with its eyes open, it had entered a trap\r\nfrom which there was no possibility of escape until in the course of\r\nnature it had digested the bait.\r\n\r\nIs it generally known that a snake does everything with its eyes\r\nopen--that it is denied the privilege of closing its eyes? Such is the\r\nindisputable fact. 'But without presuming to trespass on the preserves\r\nof men of science, the belief may be expressed that some species, if\r\nnot in possession of a movable eyelid, have some means of suspending the\r\nfaculty of sight. Indeed, there is evidence in support of the view that\r\none species has a membranous eyelid similar to, but slighter than,\r\nthat of a bird. It is not to be doubted that another reptile--the green\r\nturtle--is thus endowed, and that the “winking membrane” is found in\r\nmany animals at the inner angle or beneath the lower lid of the eye.\r\nThis membrane is represented in animals by a rudiment only. In the eyes\r\nof human beings the small reddish patch in the corner corresponds to the\r\nwinking membrane--indeed, is the vestige of it. In monkeys, and in most\r\nmammals below them, there is present in this vestige a small piece of\r\ncartilage, and this is found occasionally in man. In white races it is\r\nvery rare, occurring, as far as observations have shown, in less than\r\none per cent. Recent investigations by Dr. Paul Bartels show that in\r\ntwenty-five South African natives whom he had examined it occurred\r\nin twelve. Another investigation found it five times in twenty-five\r\nJapanese. It is curious to find that vestige more common in certain\r\nraces, as it shows that in this small point they are less advanced than\r\nthe white race.\r\n\r\nThis quotation from a forgotten source supplies important links in the\r\nchain of evidence in favour of the theory that certain species of snakes\r\nmay have the winking muscle, which exists in marine reptiles and\r\nis present in some human beings. Apart from theory, it has been my\r\ngood-fortune to see a sleeping snake the eyes of which were obscured\r\nby a greyish film, giving it the appearance of being “wall-eyed.”\r\n Being satisfied that it was blind, for it betrayed no uneasiness at a\r\nthreatening demonstration, a determination was made to preserve it for\r\ncritical examination. As soon as the snake was touched the cloudy veils\r\nwere withdrawn, and the eyes flashed with the fire of malignity. It\r\nappeared to be spiteful because it had been caught napping. The specimen\r\nwas not preserved, although it was bottled.\r\n\r\nThe blacks of this district are more nervous about adders than any\r\nother snake, with the exception of that known to them as the “Wat-tam”\r\n (pronounce the “a” as in cat), and believed to belong to the same genus\r\nas the brown snake. This is a large snake, reddish-brown in colour,\r\nthe underside, for about half the length, being bright orange, the\r\ntint gradually subsiding to pale yellow towards the tail. Post-mortem\r\nexamination of the first specimen detected on this Island cleared up a\r\nbush tragedy. A nest had been built in a conspicuous spot by a pair\r\nof shrike thrushes, which the blacks, according to locality, know as\r\n“Moorgoody” and “Too-dring.” The birds are the sweetest-voiced of all\r\nnatives, and become wondrous tame and confiding. After the big spotted\r\nand blotched eggs were hatched, the hen would perch on the side of the\r\nnest within a foot of admirers, accepting compliments with tilted head\r\nand bright and twinkling eyes. One night the brood disappeared, and\r\ndesperate things were held in store if ever a snake were found in the\r\nneighbourhood. Two days after, the alert dog gave tongue, his language\r\ndemanding urgency and extreme caution. Within twenty yards of the site\r\nof the violated nest he was found “setting” at a big snake, which had\r\nraised the forepart of its body and appeared to be concentrating\r\nits strength and agility on one fatal and perfidious spring. But the\r\nfaithful dog was watchful too, and agile, as he crouched fearlessly\r\nacross the track of man's first enemy, with its crafty pose and\r\nglittering eyes. The black boys stood afar off, for the “Wat-tam” is\r\nso arrogant and pugnacious that it does not hesitate to attack a man,\r\ninvariably with fatal results if great vigilance be not exercised--at\r\nleast, such is their belief. Science, however, shows that though the\r\nsnake has poison fangs, they are located so far back in the jaws as to\r\nbe practically ineffective. Its fierce demeanour is probably, therefore,\r\nassumed for the purposes of intimidation. The gun speedily put the\r\nwicked-looking snake out of action, and a bulge in the body indicated\r\nthe site of the last meal--the confiding thrush and her fledgeless\r\nbrood. The incident illustrates another favourite theory--viz., that\r\nvenomous snakes have a specific, distinctive odour, which warns animals\r\nlikely to be attacked of their presence. The dog kills green tree,\r\nordinary whip snakes, and the black, white-bellied species fond of\r\nreposing in the mounds of scrub hens, without ceremony and with all the\r\nzest and enthusiasm of a good sport; but in the case of venomous species\r\nso far he has not failed to call for help, but if assistance be delayed\r\nhe takes the law into his own hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe it far from me to cast doubt on the truth of that which follows. The\r\nrecord is found in “Memoirs of the Queensland Museum,” vol. ii., page\r\n43: “Although the scientific worker is hopelessly handicapped by\r\nthe vividly imaginative journalist when snake stories are told, yet\r\noccasionally there are noticed incidents startling enough in their way.\r\nDuring the cooler months a young and lithe DIEMENIA PSAMMOPHIS, Schleg,\r\npopularly known as a 'whip snake,' usually retired under a piece of bark\r\nplaced in its case, and it was only to be tempted out on warm and sunny\r\ndays. On one occasion a small skink lizard was introduced, and the snake\r\ncommenced a lively chase. The lizard ran under the bark, and on reaching\r\nthe other side scampered back over the top, closely pursued by the\r\nsnake. Again the lizard entered the bark tunnel, through which the tail\r\nof the snake was rapidly disappearing, making a spurt to keep up with\r\nthe main body. The snake darted for the lizard, missed it, and then\r\nseized its own retreating tail about two inches from the tip. With\r\ncharacteristic pertinacity it held on, and apparently the classic\r\nepisode of a snake swallowing itself was to be attempted. It was not\r\nuntil the snake was taken, out of the case and forcibly handled that\r\nit let go, there being apparently no distinction to the ophidian palate\r\nbetween its own flesh and that of its favourite lizard.” The only\r\ncomment that an unversed student of Nature may presume to make on this\r\nincident is that, possibly, the snake retained its tail because it\r\ncould not do otherwise. Are not the jaws and teeth of some snakes so\r\nconstructed, that the privilege of rejection is denied? The interests\r\nalike of science and the speculative world demanded that in the\r\ncircumstances Nature should not have been balked. Why deprive the\r\nserpent of having its own blundering way with its own tail?\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that man does directly benefit by the conflicts which\r\nrage continuously between living things lower in the scale of life\r\nthan himself; but the common slaughter is at times so cruel and so\r\ninexplicable that it is not given the average intellect to discover good\r\nand sufficient cause, though he may observe the more obvious habits and\r\nappetites of frogs and snakes. The former oft implore aid against the\r\nattacks of green tree snakes and of a big light brown lizard, fond of\r\nsleeping in hollow logs, and since one does not understand from the\r\nbeseeching tones of the frog whether it is being molested by the\r\nuniversal enemy or not, he often hastens to the rescue, laboriously cuts\r\ndown to the scene, to find, instead of a snake, a lizard, perhaps\r\nmore useful in the harmony of Nature than a frog, and certainly more\r\nendearing, since it possesses the habit of silence. Unless the frog\r\nis past recovery it has become a practice to scare the lizard, and to\r\nsuggest to the frog the sanctuary of another hollow.\r\n\r\nBut frogs are not always considerate of other and gayer creatures. A\r\nfriend who possessed a pet canary noticed that one morning in the cage\r\nof his pet there sat a panting frog, blinking in the sunlight. Thinking\r\nthat the intruder had entered the cage to assuage his thirst, he did not\r\neject it. It was the habit of the canary to hail the smiling morn with\r\ncheerful carol. In a few minutes unaccustomed silence prevailed, and\r\nthen it was noticed that the frog was distended to a degree which must\r\nhave caused it infinite satisfaction, while the canary had vanished. The\r\nconclusion was obvious and damning. Being accustomed to post mortems, my\r\nfriend settled the point forthwith, the warm canary being revealed, with\r\nbut slightly disarrayed feathers.\r\n\r\nA further illustration of the capacious and criminal appetite of the\r\nfrog may be quoted. The wet season had been generous and prolonged, the\r\ncrop of frogs prolific. The verge of a lagoon was crowded with active\r\nand lusty creatures, belonging, if colour was to be accepted as\r\nevidence, to different species, in fairly equal numbers. A casual glance\r\ninspired the thought that the occasion was nothing more than a vast\r\nassembly of greys and greens enjoying the pastime which boys imitate.\r\nAll round were leaping frogs engaged in contests--greys against\r\ngreens. Suspecting no evil intent, it was interesting thus to note the\r\nderivation of the game we have all played in sportful youth; but closer\r\ninspection proved that, instead of a friendly tournament on the grand\r\nscale, the rival frogs were indulging in shocking cannibalism. A grey\r\nfrog would approach a green, when each would appear to become fascinated\r\nby the appearance of the other. Thus would they squat for several\r\nminutes, contemplating each other's proportions and perfections. Then\r\nboth would leap high with mouths agape, and that which timed the feat to\r\nthe best advantage, or had the widest gape, seized the less fortunate,\r\nand slowly and with much straining and little apparent joy swallowed it.\r\nOften the rivals would not meet in mid air, and the lapse provided the\r\ndelusion of innocent play. There were hundreds of examples of absorption\r\nof the least fit by the fittest to survive, and the chronicling of the\r\ncannibal feast would be incomplete if a singular detail were unrelated.\r\nThe participators seemed of like size. Complexion alone varied and\r\nfoppish discrimination was exercised, for since dog does not in a\r\ngeneral way eat dog, greys did not eat greys or greens greens. With\r\nunswerving decision, greys swallowed greens and greens greys, and\r\nextreme corpulency was the inevitable result. Does this not smack of\r\nthe snake story? It certainly does, but it has the virtue of being\r\nunexaggerated, and why shrink from the telling of the plain truth?\r\n\r\nAn unwitnessed tragedy may be told in a very few words. About\r\ntwenty-five feet above high-water mark was the shaft of a white\r\nsand-crab. The site was not common, for the crabs are in the habit of\r\nburrowing well within the range of the tide. For two or three\r\ndays--for the spot was at the back of the boat-shed and under daily\r\nobservation--the alert creature was oft disturbed by my coming and\r\ngoing. One morning it remained motionless on the verge of its retreat.\r\nIt seemed to be on guard, and as a companionable feeling had been\r\naroused, I was careful as I passed not to unduly affright it. The\r\nstatuesque position being abnormally retained, I stooped down, to find\r\nthe crab dead, with the froth still on the complicated lips, while\r\nbeside it was a huge wolf spider, “tremendous still in death,” with head\r\ncrushed to pulp. One may theorise that the spider invaded the crab's\r\nburrow and was promptly evicted; a fight took place for possession of\r\nthe retreat, resulting in untoned tragedy. Venom and ponderous weapon\r\neach had done its work. Each participant had been victorious, each a\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nA still more singular bush conflict was witnessed by a friend. He heard,\r\nand not without concern, the pleading of a frog from the assaults of\r\nan enemy, but having far too many of them about the premises decided on\r\nnoninterference, thinking that the hungry snake would soon silence\r\nthe clamour. But the cries becoming shriller and more piteous, he\r\ninvestigated, finding among the leaves of a creeper on the verandah a\r\nlarge green Mantis--religiosa, too--voraciously making a meal off the\r\nhind-leg of a little green frog, which it grasped firmly. Almost the\r\nwhole of the flesh of the limb had been eaten, and the observer was\r\nof opinion from the rapacity of the insect that there would have been\r\nlittle left of the screaming frog if he had not interfered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSH TRACK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“They trade with Nature and the earth--a trade by which all that breathe\r\nupon the earth live.”--RALEIGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has no beginning. It ends--who shall say where Every high tide\r\nsmooths away the footprints of those who use it now, just as it did the\r\nerratic tramplings of the host of the past. In those free, unregulated\r\ndays piccaninnies sprawled and scampered hard, glistening beach; young\r\nmen and girls there; men lazed and fought on its convenient spaces;\r\nwomen wandered on the serious business of food-getting. The camps stood\r\na pace or two above high-water mark in the meagre shelter of sighing\r\ncasuarinas, and were often changed, for there were six miles of gently\r\ncurving, ripple-embroidered shore on which to rest. To this day most of\r\nthe traffic is regulated by the tide. High water drives the wayfarer\r\nto the loose, impeding sand, over which the great convolvulus sends its\r\ntireless tentacles, to be thrown back twisted and burnt by salt surges.\r\n\r\nThe ebb discovers a broad space, firm and wellnigh unimpresslonable. The\r\nbarefooted traveller may walk for miles and be trackless, so tough and\r\nelastic the moist sand. It is not an officious thoroughfare, made formal\r\nand precise by coarse hands working to plans correct to a hair, but\r\nsubject to economic deviations of some soulless contractor. It was not\r\nlaid with the foundation of the earth, and compacted by heat and stress.\r\nIt is still in the making, and sand, coral, and shell-grit ground to\r\npollen-like fineness and certain chemicals from the reef outside\r\nare among its component parts. One other element invokes perpetual\r\nthanksgiving--the flaked mica, which glistens delusively with hues of\r\nsilver and gold, and gives to the tide-swept track that singular pliancy\r\nwhich resists the stamp of passing generations.\r\n\r\nMidway between high and low water is a zone sensible to the airiest\r\ntread, being fitted for such temporary effect by a mechanical operation.\r\nMillions of the smallest of crabs, sand-tinted, delicate, apprehensive\r\nand alert, possess this area, working out their destiny by digging\r\ncircular shafts. Obedient agents in the execution of the imperative\r\nordinances of Nature, they have the quality of compacting the almost\r\nfluid spoil and carrying it to the surface in pellets complementary to\r\nthe size of the individual, and such pellets retain their rotundity.\r\nThey are scattered about, not without design, as may be seen if the\r\nindustrious workers are closely observed, and in such profusion that the\r\nfeet of the user of a crab-infested zone must press them flat. Then\r\nit is that the track becomes visible as far as the eyes reach. But\r\nthe incoming wavelets, babbling in unison, dissolve the myriads of\r\nlaboriously lifted pellets, effacing the record of the passing of man.\r\nAs the tides ebb, the crabs begin their work again, preparing for the\r\nnext-coming wayfarer. There is something almost incomprehensively great\r\nin the tireless activities of the nervous crabs, for not only do they\r\ncarry compacted sand from their burrows, but they seem to spend odd\r\nmoments in forming similar globes from material gathered from the\r\nsurface. Digging, furrowing the surface in stellate patterns, moulding\r\npellets which to the tenderest ripple are but the plaything of a moment,\r\nso are the lives of the shy crustaceans spent. What may be the motive\r\nfor the perpetual labour, as useless, apparently, as the rolling of\r\nSisyphus's stone? For part of the year the beach is the resort of the\r\nred-necked sandpiper, which has an enormous appetite for the small, live\r\nthings of the sea's margin. To bewilder the birds and so reduce the risk\r\nto life, Nature imposes the task upon the crabs of forming replicas of\r\nthemselves not readily distinguishable in size and tint, which\r\nrepresent labour unconsciously expended as life insurance, and serve the\r\nsubsidiary purpose of detecting the passing of man.\r\n\r\nWhat material has been left by the wayside for the history, not to be\r\naltogether despised because of its rusticity, of the unstable ways of\r\none of the ancient peoples of the world, now few in numbers, forgetful\r\nof the past, estranged from the customs of their fathers, and dying\r\nwithout mourners and without records? Search the sites of camps the\r\ntrack passes, and there is naught to tell of the manner of those who\r\nrecently occupied them save a tomahawk or a rare domestic implement of\r\nstone, and such stones do not preach thrilling but distinctive sermons.\r\nWhy hurry along this pleasant way? Is not the one domestic appliance of\r\nthe long-deserted camps worthy of passing notice? There it rests, half\r\nburied in the sand--a worn stone, with two others complementary to it\r\nto be had for the searching. It is meet that the most primitive of mills\r\nshould be examined, and that one of the several and slow processes\r\nby which a poisonous, repugnant, and intractable nut was wont to be\r\nconverted into food should be cited to the credit of the economic\r\nforethought of the most thriftless of people.\r\n\r\nOn adjacent flats and slopes grow survivals from one of the most ancient\r\nof all plants--a Cycad, that botanical paradox, combining some of the\r\ncharacteristics of the lie palm and of the pine with the appearance of a\r\ntree-fern, while being of distinctive order, which flourished during\r\nthe age when the Iguanodon and the Polacanthus and other monstrous and\r\nungainly reptiles roamed the land.\r\n\r\nLet us rest awhile reviewing the earlier operations by which its nuts\r\nwere rendered innocuous, and while the ghosts of the past make and bake\r\ntheir bread.\r\n\r\nThe fresh nuts of the plant (CYCAS MEDIA) known as Kim-alo, were\r\nroasted, and while hot bruised between two stones, the upper (Ookara) a\r\nsphere flattened at the poles into which the use of ages wore thumb\r\nand finger indentations, the nether (Diban) flat with a saucerlike\r\ndepression. Fragments of the husks were carefully eliminated. The coarse\r\nmeal was put into a dilly-bag and placed in running water below a slight\r\nfall, from the lip of which fluming, improvised from the leaf of native\r\nginger, conducted a gentle stream. Two days were sufficient to leach the\r\npoisonous principle; but if the initial process of roasting the nuts\r\nwas omitted--as in some districts--the meal was submitted to the\r\npurification of water for as long as two months, when it would be\r\ntasteless. It was then ground on the nether stone by the Moo-ki\r\n(almost a perfect sphere), used with a rotary action, until reduced to\r\nflour-like fineness, when it was made into flat or sausage-shaped cakes,\r\nwrapped in green leaves and baked. The intractability of the Cycad\r\nis such that if cattle eat the leaves they die or become permanently\r\nafflicted with a disease of the nature of rickets. To the human palate\r\nthe fresh nuts-are inflammatory, and are said to cause intense pain\r\nending with death. That the blacks discovered the means of converting\r\nsuch a substance into desirable food proves that they were often\r\nenterprisingly, daringly hungry.\r\n\r\nLet us push on, there is far to go. Chance rather than principle, it\r\nhas been said, turned the paths of old England into roads. Here may\r\nbe studied the germ of the primal path worn by the tread of the least\r\nreflective and least mobile of human beings, the causes of its erratic\r\ncourse, and the transitions by which, with amendments due to the\r\nirrefutable facts of topography, it becomes formal and authoritative--a\r\nhighway for the usurping race.\r\n\r\nLeaving the shore, one branch of the track crosses the high-water fold,\r\nfollows the bend of a mangrove creek, through which it Makes a muddy\r\nford, and is firmly impressed through forest country where every tree is\r\norchid-encumbered, and where the eager soil produces its own varieties.\r\nIt wriggles up and along a ridge, with the glaucous spathes of grass\r\ntrees standing like spears on each hand, and where wattle and tough\r\nshe-oaks grow leanly out of hard soil, thickly strewn with buckshot\r\ngravel, rust-coloured.\r\n\r\nSoon it descends into a low valley and through a belt of fan-palms\r\nand jungle bordering an ever-flowering stream the banks of which are\r\nknee-deep in fat, rich loam. Huge tea-trees stand in the water, where\r\nthe fibrous roots are matted like peat.\r\n\r\nOut of the moist coolness the track abruptly ascends to a pleasant\r\nforest, and thence drops almost imperceptibly to tea-tree flats\r\nintersected by Pandanus creeks, which bulge here and there into\r\nsedge-margined lagoons. In this “devil-devil” country it is barely the\r\nwidth of the foot, and it wanders sinuously like the trail of a lazy\r\nsnake. Sometimes it is barely more discernible than such a trail, and\r\nagain in the soft places it broadens and deepens, for the man with boots\r\nhas taken the place of the original soft-footed traveller, and horses\r\nand cattle are ever fond of the short-cuts which their owners design.\r\n\r\nHere a distinct branch is made towards a river, across which Nature, the\r\nfirst of bridge-builders, many a generation ago afforded an easy, dry\r\npassage by throwing down a huge tree. It spans from bank to bank, and\r\nthe wood is worn to slippery smoothness by the passing of shoeless feet.\r\nThence it leads through forest and jungle and mangrove belts to another\r\nriver, and away south.\r\n\r\nThe western branch keeps to forest and jungle, following, generally,\r\nthe ridges, for in the wet season the grass lands are flooded, when the\r\ntrack is but a silvery grey ribbon on a carpet of green. With careless\r\nindecision it trends west, with here an angle and there a curve, dipping\r\nand twisting, crossing gullies and creeping up slopes. The men whose\r\nfeet made it in ancient days knew all the landmarks. Mostly it keeps to\r\nsound ground, albeit its wanderings perpetuate wayward impulses.\r\n\r\nImagination may follow the blacks of bygone days as they swung past,\r\na fallen tree; where sportful youths wandered a few yards to throw\r\ngrass-tree spears at white-ants' nests on bloodwood-trees; where\r\nthey turned aside for a drink from the palm creek. Possibly the track\r\ndeviated to follow the run of a scrub turkey, or because the boys knew\r\nof a scrub hen's mound, where the rich pink eggs were raked out by the\r\ngins. It was gin's work to overhaul the mounds; the boys did not like\r\nto do the digging with their hands, for often little snakes bedded\r\nthemselves in the warm compost--snakes, though they bite not to the\r\ndeath, make one's hands big and sore. Why incur any risk when there was\r\na well-disciplined woman to take it? There was a turn off (which was\r\nofficially followed) leading to a huge tree where in the hollow bees had\r\nhived; and another straggled up the creek to the pool where eels secrete\r\nthemselves in the moist, decaying leaves.\r\n\r\nSix or seven miles from the beach, where the scarcely discernible\r\ncrabs, with persistency as eternal as the sea, are strewing the way with\r\nmillions of tell-tale pellets, the track, skirting swamps, following\r\nthe bends of a river, passing through forest and jungle, is lost in\r\nvagueness and indecision.\r\n\r\nWhen it was ordained that roads should be defined in the interests\r\nof settlers, it was natural that the original track as it then\r\nexisted--broadened and amended and bridged by the good bushmen who had\r\nused it for practical purposes--should be followed. On the plan the\r\nformal road runs a strangely erratic course, for in many places it is\r\nfaithful to the footpad. Some of the zigzags of the long past, some of\r\nits elbows and angles, its stringent lines and curves, have been copied\r\nand confirmed, for the bush track is one of the fundamental things,\r\nbearing the stamp of Nature, and no more to be obliterated by the\r\ntrivialities of art than is the sand of the shore and the illimitable\r\ncrabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE BROWN MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Care, that troubles all the world, was forgotten in his\r\ncomposition.”--CHARLES LAMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you chance to visit the Chief Protector of Aborigines on board\r\nhis yacht the MELBIDIR, one of the first to greet you, be you an old\r\nacquaintance or a stranger, may be “Jimmy,” the cook.\r\n\r\nHe is a little brown man who wears blue shoes, which are also socks, and\r\na perpetual smile. The shoes, which are of some soft material, have\r\na separate compartment for the great-toe, and hook down the heel. The\r\nChief Protector has a similar pair of combination shoes--a gift from\r\n“Jimmy”--and is given to smiling; but he does not pretend to compete\r\nwith his cook in that quality. “Jimmy's” smile is almost a fixture. It\r\nis set, yet not professional. It is the smile of a happy man, and of one\r\nwho is a diplomat as well as a ship's cook. His customary costume is of\r\nholland. When on duty he wears an exaggerated bib, and “Jimmy” without\r\nhis bib would be as little conceivable as “Jimmy” without his smile. He\r\nmay discard it when he puts on his sky-blue pyjamas for the night, but\r\nthat he smiles in his sleep is sure. The honourable wrinkles on his\r\nmahogany-hued face forbid him to relax the appearance of unceasing\r\ngood-humour, and who would suggest that his serenity is artificial?\r\n\r\nWhen he takes a hand with the whole of the ship's company to get up sail\r\nor hoist the dinghy on board, he whistles as well as smiles, and then\r\nthe black boys laugh, and life on the trim ship is more buoyant than\r\never. He goes down into the doll's-house galley backwards, smiling. Now,\r\nit is no smiling matter to be jambed up against a hot stove on a hot\r\nday when the seas run high and the yacht digs her crescent nose into the\r\nblue and washes her own decks with Neptune's suds. But “Jimmy” will bob\r\nup again in due season with a plate of hot cakes or, perhaps, even cool\r\ncakes--and the smile. He has been smiling to the oven, which is inclined\r\nto gymnastics, only it is restrained by effectual bolts. “Jimmy” is a\r\ngymnast, and his free great-toes enable him to cook under circumstances\r\nand conditions which others not so equipped would profane.\r\n\r\nSmiles are his antidote for all injurious mental ferments, and how many\r\ndiseases of the mind are there which are not to be alleviated by such\r\napt physic?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that “Jimmy” is a diplomat. He certainly is. The\r\nMELBIDIR had run within hailing distance of another yacht, the owner and\r\ncommander of which is an old friend of the Protector and “Jimmy.” When\r\nwe did hail, a silvery head and a sunburnt pair of shoulders popped\r\nup from below, and with a comprehensive wave of sunburnt arms--the red\r\ntype--vanished. Soon the same head and the same shoulders, decently\r\nbut loosely clad in blue and followed by the rest of the hearty body,\r\nemerged, and in a few minutes friends were gripping each other's hands\r\nand talking furiously about a particular island, pilots, pearls, and\r\nTorres Straits “Jimmy” passed, and the florid man in blue said, nudging\r\nhis friend, “I seem to know that boy.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you do,” replied the Protector; “that's 'Jimmy' from T. I.”\r\n\r\nWhen “Jimmy” next appeared he had a jug of water in his hand and a\r\nbigger smile than ever.\r\n\r\n“Well, 'Jimmy,' you haven't forgotten me?” suggested the big man in\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n“No. You capitain! My word, you young fellow now!”\r\n\r\nAnd we all laughed, for though the years had been tender to the man in\r\nblue, still, they had come and gone by the decade since the previous\r\nmeeting. “Jimmy's” smiles became vocal. Professional diplomats use\r\nthe great gift of speech, it is said, to delude the enemies of their\r\ncountry. “Jimmy's” adroit compliment was the more delicate in that it\r\nwas not official and he cannot possess an enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen he puckers his lips to whistle, “Jimmy's” smiles are singularly\r\ninfectious. The Protector's yacht is not a missionary, but merely, as\r\nher name signifies, a messenger; but the Protector does not forbid the\r\nhymnal. “Jimmy” has one, and as he studies the pious poems, for he reads\r\nfluently, whistles appropriately. While we lolled on deck, familiar\r\ntunes wooed my wandering thoughts. “Jesu, Lover of my Soul,” came line\r\nafter line, verse after verse, precisely, though the tone was soft.\r\nWas the black boy thus accompanying his work at the pump? No; for the\r\nstrokes were not in time, and the boy occasionally chatted with his\r\nchum. I asked, and was told that “'Jimmy' mak'm good fellow corroboree.”\r\n Presently he came up--smiling, and with the last notes of “Abide with\r\nMe” on his lips. Then I questioned him, and for a space we discussed our\r\nfavourite hymns and hummed them, or rather I did, for “Jimmy” was too\r\nshy to do more than nod in time before a stranger. He confided, almost\r\nin a whisper, that when he was alone he learned the words of the hymns,\r\nand afterwards picked up the tunes. Is it not pretty to think of the\r\nwrinkled Japanese in bunk beside the hot and clamorous engine conning\r\nhymnal--a trifle blotched with grease here and there--and whistling\r\nsoftly those endearing tunes on which so many of us were brought up?\r\n\r\nLong may “Jimmy” cook and wear blue shoes a modestly supplicate “For\r\nthose in Peril on the Sea”! That he may smile to the last would be a\r\nsuperfluous prayer. He cannot do else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP AND AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Man is the merriest species of creation; all above and below him are\r\nserious.”--ADDISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let's up and away, Bill,” said Breezy Jim, as he started to his feet.\r\n“I'm dog tired of this game. We're just working for tucker for the boys\r\nand nothing--not even a smoke--for ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Don't be in such a flurry. We might drop on a patch yet. I vote we stay\r\nfor another week. The anchorage is all right, and the season's\r\nyoung. The little bit of fish we've got ain't too stinking. It'll pay\r\nexpenses.” Placid and patient, the half-caste Solomon Islander, Billy\r\nBoolah, kept cheek on his impetuous partner, whose restless disposition\r\nforbade him to continue long in one stay unless circumstances were\r\nessentially favourable.\r\n\r\nCertainly fish were not too plentiful, but the aboriginal crew worked\r\nwell, and were lighthearted almost to a fault. They had had no credit\r\nto pledge for the season's stores. They had merely to pick up inert and\r\nunresisting béche-de-mer from among the coral five fathoms down, where\r\nthe deceptive sea looked no more than ten feet deep under the squalid\r\nflatties; to smoke and jabber in idle moments; to eat and to sleep, and\r\nto listen to Mammerroo's version of the opening phrases of “The Last\r\nRose of Summer” on a mouth-organ worn with inveterate usage to the bold\r\nbrass. The tune was not quite beyond recognition, and no musician was\r\never more in earnest, ever more soul-tied to an elusive, unwritten air\r\nthan the black boy who wore little else than his own unwashed complexion\r\nand a strip of red Turkey twill. For long months he had pursued it with\r\nall the fervour of his simple soul, and though it said him nay, still\r\ndid he hope and woo. Out of his scanty earnings he bought mouth-organs\r\nby the dozen, for he believed that owing to some defect on the part\r\nof such instruments the tune was impossible save to one. Would he ever\r\nobtain that prize? The organ which could play that tune as he had\r\nonce heard it when his boss took him to a concert at Cairns had to\r\nbe discovered, and to earn money to buy it Mammerroo shipped on these\r\ndetestable béche-de-mer cruises. In the meantime he would play with all\r\nhis energies and with endless repetition the halting, nerve-disturbing\r\nnotes he knew to be incorrect.\r\n\r\n“That boy will drive me mad. He bought ten mouth-organs at Cooktown, and\r\nhe hasn't got the one that plays the tune yet. Does this smell like 'The\r\nLast Rose of Summer'? Why, you can hear those fish of yours humming!\r\nWhat with hardly any fish, the stink of the whole boat, and that\r\nmaddening mouth-organ, I feel almost inclined to jump overboard and\r\nmarry a mermaid. Let's chuck it.”\r\n\r\n“It's you as got the bad breath, Jim. Every man when he gets nasty\r\ntemper he gets bad breath. That tune it's little bit close up. He can\r\nplay right up to the 'left blooming alone' sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“He's taken four months to get up to the 'left blooming alone'! At that\r\nrate it will be years before he gets to the finish. I'll be mad if he\r\nstays on this hooker another month. I'll chuck the three of them--organ,\r\nboy, and tune--overboard.”\r\n\r\n“If you make yourself a fool like that, no more work from that boy.\r\nDon't be a fool and spoil this game. We're out till November. Let's make\r\nthe best of it.”\r\n\r\nIt was not clean work. The reek of the fish-raw, cooked, smoked, and\r\ndrying in the sun-saturated everything, even the damper. The brown,\r\nshrivelled things were scattered in orderly profusion wherever the\r\nsun could catch them to top them off prior to bagging. The bitter,\r\neye-searing smoke from the red mangrove fire in the hold, where the\r\nmeagre catch of yesterday was lying on a couple of trays, stung the\r\nnostrils. The odour was as interminable as the half-accomplished tune,\r\nand Breezy Bill writhed. He was not new to the game, but bad luck had\r\nbeen the portion of the ship from the start, and small things irritated\r\nhim, rasping his far from sensitive soul.\r\n\r\n“I think you are going to catch fever, Jim. That's what's the matter\r\nwith you. At the mission I used to read about that bird you call the\r\nbrain-fever bird. It just keeps on whistling the same old thing, and\r\nwhite men go mad. That 'Last Rose of Summer,' it's got hold of you.\r\nDon't be a fool! It's only a good tune half done. It won't kill\r\nanybody--at any rate, a tough old shell-back like you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, bother! Stinks and rotten 'Last Rose of Summer' are driving me mad.\r\nI could stand lots of both if we were doing well. They might be forty\r\noverproof and played by forty bands, and every darned piccolo of them\r\nout of tune, if only we were making money. Come, let's up stick and\r\naway. We can't do worse and we might do better on that bit of 'reef\r\nMammerroo talks about. Here, Mammerroo, stop that blasted corroboree!\r\nCome and tell us where that little fella reef sit down.”\r\n\r\nMammerroo shuffled down to the hatchway covering and traced a chart of\r\nthe locality with a grimy forefinger.\r\n\r\n“That fella reef sit down 'nother side Red Hill alongside mainlan'. No\r\ndeep water. Plenty mangrove--my word full up pigeon. Reef him little\r\nfella. Full up tit fish, calla-calla, mainlan' black. Fill'um up boat.\r\nTake'm alonga Thors'dilan'. Come back. Fill'm up one time more. Too\r\nmuch. Full up.”\r\n\r\n“The same old yarn. I've been all over that ground. There's no reef\r\nthere, and if there had been it would have been found and skinned years\r\nago,” said dogmatic Billy, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Jim; “the season's over as far as you are concerned. You\r\ncan go where you like. I'm sick of it now.”\r\n\r\nTROPIC DAYS\r\n\r\nThe next morning saw the NAUTILUS scudding before a strong south-east\r\nbreeze, Jim, true to his name, sulky as a toad-fish. The good wind\r\nharped on the rigging as Mammerroo tirelessly lagged after the ever\r\nevasive tune. Jim heard him not. Billy, in a rage, was inclined to\r\nbundle the boy and his battered instrument overboard, for he saw in the\r\nrace north nothing but a waste of time.\r\n\r\nThree days later the NAUTILUS anchored to the north of Red Hill under\r\nthe lee of a low mangrove island uproarious with nutmeg pigeons.\r\n\r\nAll hands turned out to prospect, with Mammerroo as pilot. He was not\r\nlong in locating the reef--a forgotten and neglected patch that teemed\r\nwith fish. Béche-de-mer lay in shallow water, thick and big, by\r\nthe ton.. The reef, with its clear sandy patches, seemed to be the\r\ngathering-ground, the metropolis, the parliament of the curious creature\r\nwhich makes feeble eddies with its distended gills, moves with infinite\r\nand mysterious deliberation, and which, though it may be two feet long\r\nand three inches thick, can pass through a half-inch space, constricting\r\nits bulging body during the progress.\r\n\r\nThe mangroves of the islet provided the best of fuels for the\r\npreservative smoke. The fortnightly steamer passed not so very far out,\r\nso that it would be possible to send away a couple of tons at a time\r\nwithout leaving the locality or suspending work for more than an hour or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nWith cheerfulness and enthusiastic haste all started to work. No\r\nirritating odour, no vexing tune, was perceptible or audible. Boys\r\nbrought in such quantities of fish that the mates could hardly cook and\r\ncure them. Money was being coined, and the making of money begat dreams.\r\nSeamen do not invariably build castles in the air. They devise aerial\r\nfleets. They build bigger, better, and faster boats to sail on bluer\r\nseas into more prosperous and happy havens than belong to this too\r\nsubstantial world. Each sketches out the boat of his desire, and fits\r\nher with wondrous comfort and conveniences. He glances, approving head\r\nthrown back, up her tall, tapering, well-oiled masts, silver-topped\r\nwith golden trucks. He paints her in rival colours, rigs her with silken\r\nsails, names her after a sweetheart, and sails away to lands fairer than\r\nany of the isles of the Pacific--those isles of dreams where in coral\r\ngroves the gold-lip is embarrassed with pearls of ineffable lustre and\r\nof excessive size.\r\n\r\nAs they day-dreamed they gathered in actual riches, for the lazy fish\r\nwere big and almost overlying each other in their crowded spaces.\r\n\r\nNever was there a happier béche-de-mer cruise, for the prospects of good\r\nwages soon and a quick return to accustomed camps overladen with the\r\nspoils of the Cooktown stores made each boy as joyful as a cherub and as\r\nindustrious as a scrub hen. Mammerroo saw visions of mouth-organs,\r\none of which was sure to contain the coveted tune. Little deaf Antony\r\nthought of tobacco unlimited, a silver-mounted pipe, and plenty of\r\nunforbidden rum. Indeed, most of the boys contented themselves with\r\nthese ingredients to fill the cup of happiness. But big lazy Johnnie's\r\nfancy went to a small jockey's cap of red and yellow, to be worn with a\r\nfootball jersey of orange and green in stripes, and blue trousers. This\r\ngorgeous costume was to compensate for present pains and humiliation,\r\nfor he had nothing but a scanty and dirty loin-cloth, a necklace of\r\ngrass beads, and a chip of lustrous black-lip pearl-shell stuck in one\r\near. As they worked they let their fancies range, and thus was the\r\ntoil eased and the bags of dried fish safely stowed in the hold.\r\nWith twenty-eight bags in prime condition, the NAULITUS sailed out to\r\nintercept the steamer--the LAVA KAVA. The honest stuff was sent off to\r\nthe agent at the Island post, and back the stout little vessel went to\r\nthe reef.\r\n\r\n“As good as a gold-mine,” said Breezy Jim, who every day became\r\nbreezier, so that he threatened to develop into a gale of good humour.\r\n\r\n“Better than splitting coco-nuts at the Mission Station,” said Billy\r\nBoolah.\r\n\r\n“Do you ever feel like chucking Mammerroo overboard now?”\r\n\r\nAnother fortnight saw another big load on the way to the agents.\r\nMammerroo poured out his soul in fervency over the limping phrases of\r\nhis besetting tune, and even Boisterous Jim applauded his persistency.\r\n\r\n“That boy will catch 'The Last Rose of Summer' some day if the\r\nmouth-organ market holds out. I'll give him the best to be got in\r\nCooktown, and I'm bothered if I don't teach him the tune!”\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon a strange sail came into view. Slowly the big cutter\r\nmade for the anchorage, for the wind, busy elsewhere, could spare only a\r\nfew idle puffs for her business.\r\n\r\n“That's a dago, I bet,” said Bill. “And I know who it is! Why, it's that\r\nhumbug, Black Charley!”\r\n\r\n“We'll have to be pretty spry, or he'll have some of this patch. We'll\r\nhead him off, and ship what we've got to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nA flattie slid over the side of the cutter and plopped into the water,\r\nand Black Charley, with a couple of downcast boys, came alongside the\r\nNAUTILUS.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Bill! Hullo, Jim! How's yous getting on? Yous drop on good\r\nplace. I see yous boys picking up fish like a hen picking up corn.”\r\n\r\n“Not much,” replied Jim. “It was pretty thick, but it was only a small\r\npatch, and we've pretty well cleaned it up. Sent away half a dozen bags,\r\nmostly mainlan' black. Too close in to be much good.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose you'se no objection to me anchoring here for a bit and\r\n'seeing what I can do with the leavings?” said Black Charley.\r\n\r\n“We found the patch, and it's too small for two boats. We'd be better\r\nfriends if you cleared off and left it to us,” replied Jim. “But if\r\nyou're up to dirty tricks stay where you are. We don't want sneaks on\r\nboard this craft.”\r\n\r\n“It's no good being nasty. All the fish on the Barrier don't belong to\r\nyous. I got a ton and more on board now, and I'm going to run out with\r\nit to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“So are we. Come on board and have a drink”\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when the smoke of the LAVA KAVA showed\r\nsouth-east. Both boats were waiting as she slowed down in her course,\r\nand while they made fast transhipment began. Then she steamed slowly\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n“Better send you'se boys back with the NAUTILUS,” suggested Black\r\nCharley, “and me and my mate will take yous back when we've had a drink\r\nand a bit to eat. It's a long time since I've had a decent feed, and\r\nCaptain Andrews, he won't mind.”\r\n\r\nBreezy Jim and Bill agreeing, the NAUTILUS cast off, with instructions\r\nto anchor at the old spot and to work until the bosses returned.\r\n\r\nThere was more than one drink as the steamer forged ahead, with Black\r\nCharley's cutter romping and curtseying behind. Then tea-time came, and\r\nthe captain asked his guests to remain. Black Charley had had so many\r\nrefreshments that he was scarcely fit company for the saloon, so he\r\noffered his excuses and they were accepted with politely veiled relief.\r\n\r\nThe mates told of their bad luck down at the Barnards and the Palms;\r\nhow they had been driven away by the unmusical black boy in desperate\r\npursuit of “The Last Rose of Summer,” and of their great stroke of luck\r\non the reef of which he had told.\r\n\r\n“There's plenty more fish on it yet. We'll be troubling you to stop for a\r\ncouple of months yet.”\r\n\r\n“You won't be making a very early start to-morrow if we jerk your boat\r\nmuch further,” remarked Captain Andrews, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Come,” urged Bill. “We'll hunt up Charley and cut away back.”\r\n\r\nThe well-contented partners strolled on deck, anticipating a very tipsy\r\nCharley, whom neither steward nor bo'sun could discover.\r\n\r\nThe sun had just set. A bewildering blank astern excited a wide and\r\ncomprehensive survey, and there in the blue-grey of the south-east Black\r\nCharley's big white-winged cutter was fast fading from view.\r\n\r\nWhen the partners got back to the reef, via Thursday Island and\r\nCooktown, a fortnight later, the boys were there, looking somewhat\r\njaded. The NAUTILUS was as trim as ever, for which the owners were\r\nsufficiently thankful; but cute Black Charley, working both crews day\r\nand night like galley slaves, had mopped up the patch as clean as the\r\nfloor of a hospital ward.\r\n\r\n“We've bin had proper, Bill, old fellow. Let's up and away for Cooktown.\r\nMammerroo moans for that mouth-organ!”\r\n\r\nAnd the Christian in Billy Boolah smiled as he hummed “Left blooming\r\nAlone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Whence has the man the balm that brightens all?”\r\n\r\nBROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not popular, perhaps Tsing Hi was the best known of his\r\ncontemporaries on the tableland through which the Palmer River wanders\r\na hundred miles from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Short, slimly made as a\r\nfourteen-year-old boy, nimble, fussy, plausible, he stood out from\r\namong his countrymen as one having authority, while he posed among\r\nthe Europeans as a kind of diplomatic agent, explaining away\r\nmisunderstandings, conciliating grievances, and generally comporting\r\nhimself as the chartered representative of the horde of yellow new-chums\r\nwhich invaded the most sensational of all Australian goldfields. He\r\nappeared to have cousins among every fresh shipload from China, as well\r\nas among the hundreds who ferreted in the gullies. There was not a white\r\nman, from the Police Magistrate to Frank Deester's off-sider, with whom\r\nhe was not on terms of easy familiarity.\r\n\r\nHad he not often confidentially consulted the Warden when a cousin had\r\nblundered into the hands of the police, embarrassing that flustered\r\nofficial with torrents of half intelligible speech, the purport of which\r\ngenerally was to flout the proceedings with evidence of indubitable\r\nalibi? All this he translated to his countrymen as proof of personal\r\ninfluence with court authorities, and, what was more to the point, made\r\nthem pay for it.\r\n\r\nNo case in which a Chinaman was concerned as the accused, or plaintiff,\r\nor disinterested witness, but Tsing Hi took, if not an official, an\r\nofficious part. Every new-comer from the Flowery Land passed through his\r\nhands. He knew what personal property each possessed, and the value of\r\nthe gold of the lucky departing ones. That he prospered exceedingly was\r\nevident. The fact was expressed in his costume. Beyond the court fees\r\nas interpreter, the merry, chirping little fellow had really no lawful,\r\nvisible means of support. Yet he glistened and gleamed with emblems of\r\nriches. He was a dandy from the soles of his shiny elastic-side boots\r\nto the crown of his jaunty hard-hitter. Across a yellow waistcoat hung\r\na very aggressive chain, from which dangled a huge masonic jewel\r\nin gold-and-blue enamel, and the frequently consulted watch--a big,\r\nbold-faced lever--ticked with snappy determination. Tsing Hi had much\r\nmore to live up to than the huge watch, the chain, and the emblem;\r\nbut they seemed to constitute special and peculiar insignia. They were\r\nalways to the front. He was one of the men of his day and scene--to\r\nbe admired, feared, and to be conciliated by his fellow-countrymen all\r\nalong the traffic-torn road.\r\n\r\nThe dust from that tortuous road rose in an earth adhering cloud from\r\nout which honest, clean-souled men came like pain-distorted spectres,\r\nwearing grey tear stained masks with pink-rimmed eyeholes and mud edged\r\nmouths. But the dust was less distressing than that which Tsing Hi threw\r\nin the eyes of bewildered mankind by this burst and gusts of speech.\r\n\r\nIn the heyday of his fame and prosperity Tsing Hi disappeared.\r\nHis absences were customary, for did he not flit here, there, and\r\neverywhere? The police were not troubled to make inquiries. They knew\r\nwhere he was, and the reason for his sudden retirement from accustomed\r\nscenes. The next day all Byerstown knew also.\r\n\r\nTsing Hi, within the rough-hewn walls of the lock-up, was sad and\r\nsilent. He had been arrested for gold-stealing.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear case. Hundreds of complaints had been made. Dozens of\r\nsuspects had been shadowed, until a quick-witted detective intuitively\r\nfastened the responsibility on the court interpreter, who, on the\r\ninstant of arrest, had become dumb.\r\n\r\nThe ransacking of his hut revealed a magazine of riches, the earthen\r\nfloor beneath the bunk being honeycombed with pits containing easily\r\nportable but valuable property. In a jam-tin were several nuggets, among\r\nthem the very specimen which Bill Haddon had given to Mrs. Sinclair,\r\nlandlady of the Carriers' Arms--a plane of crystal from which rose a\r\nwonderfully true pyramid of gold. It had been admired by hundreds,\r\nand could be sworn to by everyone who had seen it. There was the white\r\nsapphire, with a tell-tale flaw running down the middle, which had been\r\nfound in the hopperings at Revolver Point (where fighting Cameron made\r\nhis pile) by Sam Kickford, and likewise bestowed on Mrs. Sinclair as a\r\n“curio,” and because that bounteous lady had mothered the unlucky Sam\r\nand nursed him through the fever which took him to the very gates of\r\na filthy hell. Dozens could swear to it, but ever so many more were\r\ncapable of bearing witness against Tsing Hi on account of the specimen\r\nwhich Sam's mate, who had died of the fever, had given to Mrs. Sinclair,\r\nhaving picked it out from the face of his drive. It was a slug of rough\r\ngold in the shape of a tiny canoe, with an upright splinter of white\r\nquartz at each end. Sam's mate had intended it for a girl down at\r\nBallarat, and she eventually got it--an emblem of what might have been.\r\nDozens of fancy slugs were brought to light, in addition to two hundred\r\nounces of fine gold against which no one could make good claim.\r\n\r\nAnother tin held six rings, two of decidedly suspicious metal, the\r\nothers genuine and with good stones. A fine pearl was wrapped in a\r\nfragment of silk. A pale green jade amulet, with three sets of. Chinese\r\ntoilet contrivances--ear-cleaners, tongue-scrapers, back-scratchers--in\r\nivory, were in a box with two rolls of gold-embroidered silk illustrated\r\nwith weirdly indecent scenes. Three gold watches wrapped in silk\r\nhandkerchiefs were stuffed into a ginger-jar. The sordid hut was a mine\r\nof wealth, and the buzzing town became furious. It had accepted Tsing\r\nHi as a character, but not as a bad one. Being deceived, it swerved\r\nfrom tolerance to righteous indignation and absolute wrath. The quaking\r\nthief, not too comfortable, for the bloodwood slabs seemed too frail\r\na partition against the virtuous anger of the crowd, was condemned\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nAll the identifiable gold and other property was handed over to those\r\nwho successfully established claims, and Tsing Hi, limp and dejected,\r\npassed into the custody of Tim Mullane for escort to Cooktown.\r\n\r\nTim was rough and raw, teeming with good-nature and blessed with a\r\nbrogue as thick as the soles of the massive boots made for him by\r\nhis cousin Terence at misty Ballinrobe. The once perky Tsing Hi slunk\r\nalongside the far-striding Tim, and Tim looked down at him and was half\r\nashamed of such a “wee scrap of a Chinkee” as his first prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Come away wid ye, me little fella--come away. Doan give me trouble, and\r\nye'll fin' me gintle wid ye. Thry to maake a fool af me, and be the Holy\r\nSaints ye'll have occasion to be sorrowful.” And he picked Tsing Hi\r\nup with one hand and set him down again with as big a jolt as such a\r\nfag-end of humanity could expect to produce. Tsing Hi remained meek.\r\nThe crowd was unanimously against him. Big Tim might jolt him again and\r\nagain rather than he would take the risk of venturing among his recent\r\nfriends, for tales of his thieving, his acceptance of bribes, and\r\nimposition of levies, were coming in so fast and thick that the crowd\r\nwould have relished adding something on its own account.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight next morning Tim left with his disconsolate captive, who\r\nwore handcuffs and was manacled to the “D's” in the saddle of the horse\r\nwhich he bestrode manifestly ill at case. In front of him was a huge\r\nswag containing the unidentifiable gold, three watches, three rings,\r\nsilk stuffs, three pairs of elastic-side boots., several pairs of\r\npuce-coloured socks, flash neckties, four hats, three suits of clothes,\r\nand other clothing., All this was his own, to be handed over at the\r\nexpiration of the sentence. Tim merely held the inventory. There was\r\nsome sort of gratification for ill-doing, for the swag contained a\r\nfortune. He savagely reflected that six months would soon pass. He would\r\nthen vanish from “Qee'lan,” to enjoy himself for the rest of his days.\r\nThe sadness which had stagnated during the past week began to dissolve.\r\nHe sought to make a friend of his escort.\r\n\r\n“I tink we cam' harp way to-ni', Tim.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, you implicating tadpole! Wasn't I ordhered to hold convarse\r\nwid me prisoner? Spake win Ye're spoke ter and be civil, Or I'll jolt\r\nthe teeth troo your hat!”\r\n\r\nTim jogged on, and the led horse bearing Tsing Hi jogged after. Tsing Hi\r\nbumped until he was fain to lean heavily on his precious swag, trying to\r\ndiscover by sensation an' unbruised part of his body on which to jolt.\r\n\r\n“Hi! hi!” he shouted. “Horsey, him no goo'! You l'me walk!”\r\n\r\nTim whistled and jogged. Tsing Hi jolted and whimpered. The hot miles\r\nwriggled slowly past. Dust lay a foot deep on the track. It was a\r\nwindless day. Tsing Hi, gripping with fearful intensity his swag, could\r\nnot lift a finger to wipe the stains which stood for many tears and\r\ncoursed down his cheeks in tiny rivulets, making puddles on his cramped\r\nhands. He, the dandy, smothered in dust, weeping, sore in every\r\nbone, blistered and scalded, pondered over his petty sins, moaned\r\ncontinuously, and longed for the hard floor of the gaol.\r\n\r\nHe, a disciple of Confucius, found no present relief in the tags of the\r\nmaster's philosophy that he could call to mind. Tears made him a grim\r\nspectacle. The beautiful yellow waistcoat was indistinguishable beneath\r\ndirt and dust. His carefully tended queue shook out in disordered\r\nloops, and finally dangled, dust-soiled, behind. His trousers worked and\r\nwrinkled up to the knees, chafed his unaccustomed skin, and still Tim in\r\na cloud of dust jogged on singing:\r\n\r\n    “Until that day, plase God, I'll shtick\r\n    To the wearin' o' the green.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a poor little prisoner, but his first and his own, and Tim\r\nwas elated, and when a true Irishman is happy he becomes poetically\r\npatriotic. But happy though he undoubtedly was, even Tim was not sorry\r\nwhen the chance came of stretching his legs and incidentally sluicing\r\ndown the dust. The halfway house looked cool and clean to him. In fact\r\nit was neither. It must have appeared a celestial scene to moaning Tsing\r\nHi. The rough upright slabs (once rich yellow, now dingy) promised some\r\nsort of refuge from the dust, and the narrow strip of verandah a thin\r\nslice of shade. The mound of broken bottles at the rear betokened\r\nthe drinks of the past, while the mind dwelt lovingly on those of\r\nthe present. Three panting goats, all aslant, but tressed themselves\r\ndeterminedly against the end of the house, and two boys, long since dust\r\nimmune, occasionally hunted the goats into the sun and away among the\r\nant-hills. But when Tsing Hi slid from the horse and into the shade, he\r\nfelt like a saint in bliss. They gave him water, and he wailed until\r\nTim silenced him with threats of jolts and locked the manacles round the\r\nmiddle post.\r\n\r\nTim sighed profoundly as he scented beer. “I do belave I'm dhry, Jerry.\r\nGive's a long un. I've swallowed mud by the bucket. Give the wee little\r\ndivil outside a pannikin o' tay. Maybe it'll revoive, him!”\r\n\r\nTim drank long and well.\r\n\r\n“I've heard about the case,” Jerry said, as he filled the thick glass a\r\nthird time. “Fancy the little beggar, an' him commin' and goin' as flash\r\nas ye make 'ern, and pickin' and thavin' all the time. Maybe he got the\r\near-rings the missis is after missin'.”\r\n\r\n“Nawthin' o' the sort's in the swag we took with the raskil.”\r\n\r\nA bit of dinner in the back room waited, for Jerry believed in keeping\r\nwell in with the force. Tim fed heartily, and, in spite of dust, heat,\r\nand the chatter of the children, dozed, to wake with a start.\r\n\r\n“Me sowl to glory! It's aslape I've bin! Let's hav' a look at the little\r\nfella and be off.”\r\n\r\nThe horses stood limply, as much out of the shade as in, the big swag\r\nleaned against the wall, the handcuffs lay half buried in the dust, but\r\nTsing Hi had vanished.\r\n\r\n“Me sowl to glory! The little divil's scooted! It's a ruined man I am!\r\nIn the name of the Saints, why is blasted Chinkees made with han's an'\r\n'em like a 'possum? Look at the wee han's on 'em to slip out of\r\ndarbies like the same. He's slipped out as aisily as meself out of a\r\nhorse-collar, and the face a' him as bould and as big as the hill o'\r\nhope! I'm the ruined man, I am!”\r\n\r\n“Off after him,” advised Jerry. “There's his tracks.”\r\n\r\n“Just none o' your blasted interfarances! Lave 'm to me. He's away back\r\nto hell, an' I'll folly him! How much does I owe yer, Jerry!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all, sure, Tim. 'Tis little ye've had, and yer welcome as\r\nposies in May, though it's little we see of 'em here. And good luck.\r\nShall I tell him away, back to look out V'\r\n\r\n“Say nothing and be damned to yer! Keep your mout closed and lave me to\r\ndo the bizinis me own road,” shouted Tim as he disappeared in the dust,\r\nled horse, swag and all.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half back and a bit off the road lay the narrow, sheltered\r\nflat between two forbiddingly barren ridges which Hu Dra, the gardener,\r\nhad converted into an oasis. Thin-leaved tea-trees fringed the little\r\ndam whence the industrious fellow hauled water for his vegetables.\r\nDrought-stricken, broad, blue-leaved, scented ironbarks stood in envious\r\narray on the steep sides of the ridges, and grass-trees, blackened at\r\nthe butts, struggled with loose boulders for foothold. The muddy water\r\nwhich the forethought of Hu Dra had conserved created the green patch\r\nwhich insulted the aridity of the ridge. He was a proud and happy man,\r\na follower of the healing Buddha, a new-churn with scarce a word of\r\nEnglish, and a gardener. He had a way with vegetables. They prospered\r\nunder his hands, and he also prospered, for next to gold, vegetables\r\nwere highly prized in that dry, almost verdureless country. Just now he\r\nswayed along with a pair of heavy baskets slung on a bamboo all the way\r\nfrom Wu Shu, as the pilgrim under his load of sin, and as he swayed he\r\nsang in a weak falsetto a ditty which sounded like--\r\n\r\n    “Nam mo pen shih shih chia\r\n    Man tan lai lei tsun fo;\r\n    Hu fa chu t'ien p'u sa,\r\n    An fu ssu, Li she tzn.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis baskets, each screened with languid gum-leaves, held the week's\r\noutput of his garden, representing in money value at least two pounds.\r\nIt wag not likely to yield half as much, for, being a new-chum, he was\r\nfair game, and it was considered smart to impose on his good-nature.\r\nHe also paid through an agent a weekly levy to Tsing Hi, which he\r\nunderstood purchased the tolerance, if not goodwill, under all and every\r\ncircumstance of the dreaded police and the populace generally. It was a\r\ntax; but Hu Dra was patient under such exactions, as all his ancestors\r\nhad been. They were unavoidable, inevitable, a part of the mystery of\r\nlife, and consequently to be endured, if not with complacency, at\r\nleast without murmur. His profits for the week might total one pound,\r\na princely sum considering the scene and circumstances of his birth and\r\nupbringing in far Li-Chiang, where his father had reared a large family\r\nin a shed over a sewer, and had never possessed property or estate worth\r\nmore than five shillings. Soon, if this money-making business continued\r\nto thrive, he would return thither. He might--for had he not been reared\r\nto the art of living in such places?--resume the sewer habit; but with\r\nthree hundred pounds in good English gold what sewer in Li-Chiang could\r\nnot be transformed into Paradise?\r\n\r\nOne basket contained a huge fruit which he understood his white\r\ncustomers to term “plonkn”; with it was a broad-bladed knife, with which\r\nhe would slice off slabs according to demand. That one item might\r\nbring him in more money than his revered father's fortune. Wrapped in\r\nday-dreams, he hummed again his chant, dwelling on the refrain with\r\nlyrical gladness--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Li she tzu.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the name of the maiden he proposed to ask to share his\r\nfortune and his portion of the sewer, and so he repeated--\r\n\r\n---“Li she t----!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA big, strong, authoritative hand had gripped him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe screamed. The baskets sat down plump.\r\n\r\n“Come away wid ye! I've cotched yer! I'll tache ye to escape from lawful\r\ncustody!”\r\n\r\n“No savee! No savee!” screamed Hu Dra.\r\n\r\n“I'll tache ye, thin V' shouted Tim, and Hu Dra reeled under the\r\nseverity of the first lesson--a back-hander across the face.\r\n\r\n“Wha' for?” asked Hu Dra, still staggering.\r\n\r\n“Come on! You know wha' for! I'll stan' none o' yer wha' for's!”\r\n\r\nHu Dra clung to the basket-stick threateningly.\r\n\r\n“Fwhat! Resisting the pollis in the execution of dooty. Me bhoy, ye're a\r\nnew-chum or yer niver wad be so bould. It is sarious bizinis.” The stick\r\nflew out of Hu Dra's hands, and, as if by magic, he found his hands\r\nclamped in iron bands, which pinched his wrists excruciatingly.\r\n\r\nHe yelled with vexation, fear, and pain.\r\n\r\n“Ye can holler as much as ye have the moind ter. Be jabers, the next\r\nhaythen Chinkee that gits out of the darbies I clap on'm 'll be a\r\nslippery, slathery eel, and meself after fergittin' to maake a knot in\r\nhis taale! Come quiet, me good haythen, and I'll dale aisy wid yer.”\r\n\r\nHu Dra securely manacled to a scented gum, Tim dealt with the baskets,\r\ncapsizing the contents and belabouring them with the bamboo until they\r\nlooked as if they had been the playthings of a baboon. Hu Dra watched\r\nthe foundation of his fortune vanish. He wailed.\r\n\r\n“Come away, me bhoy! I arrest ye, Tsing Hi, fer escaping from lawful\r\ncustody. Ye may be charged also with resisting the pollis in the\r\nexecution of dooty. It's a sarious charge. If ye come quiet I'll maake\r\nit aisy fer ye. If ye maake it a haard job for me, be gorra I'll inuake\r\nye sorryful!”\r\n\r\nHu Dra gathered that it was a case of mistaken identity. He endeavoured\r\nto explain that he was Hu Dra, and not Tsing Hi. Tim curtly informed\r\nhim that he was none other than Tsing Hi, that he had been convicted of\r\nstealing gold, and while on the way to Cooktown had wilfully and with\r\nmalice aforethought escaped from legal custody. He would be taken to\r\nCooktown at once. Hu Dra understood but little of the harangue, but\r\nbeing a pious Buddhist, having once climbed the Holy Mountain to gain\r\nmerit, and being in the hands of a strong man armed, he accepted the\r\nfate of the moment. Meekly he followed Tim to the spot where the horses\r\nhad been left, and was hoisted into the saddle and manacled. It was all\r\na dreadful mystery, but he was sage enough to accept hard facts.\r\n\r\n“Me Hu Dra,” he explained over and over again, in vain repetition.\r\n\r\n“Ye're Tsing Hi, I tell yer. Ye're Tsing Hi in the name of Her Majesty.\r\nHaven't I arrested ye as sich?”\r\n\r\n“Me Hu Dra,” reiterated the captive as they jogged on. “Me come Coo'tow'\r\none yar.”\r\n\r\n“Shut yer mout! Didn't I tell yer before that ye're Tsing Hi? Didn't yer\r\nwilfully and knowingly escaape from me whin I was having a bite to ate,\r\nand I had yer tied to the post at the shanty back beyant there! Naw,\r\nI'll hear no more of yer Hu Rahin'. Kape a civil tongue betune yer\r\ntaath, or, be gorra, worse 'll happen yer.”\r\n\r\nHu Dra was patient. He thought of his pilgrimage long ago to the top of\r\nMount Omei. Was this the reward he had gained?\r\n\r\nHe solaced his soul by murmuring the pious invocation which all pilgrims\r\nto the Sacred Mount have perpetually on their lips--“Om mane padme om!”\r\n\r\nTorn from his secluded garden and happy and profitable toil, bruised and\r\nmanacled, bundled on to a fear-provoking horse, hurried off he knew not\r\nwhither, through a drought-stricken land under a searing sun, the road\r\nreeking with dust--what a plight for a devout Buddhist, who had sought\r\nto avert calamity and prolong life by the ascent of the chill mount\r\nwhere, alone in all the world, is revealed the “Glory of Buddha.”\r\n\r\nMystic that he was, he found sure comfort in pious meditations. Present\r\npains of body and mind vanished as with half-shut eyes he drifted into\r\nthe chill realm where he hearkened to chants of priests, the tinkling of\r\nthe temple bells, the fervent response of hundreds of pilgrims as meek\r\nas himself--“Om mane padme om!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the potency of the mechanical repetition of the all-healing\r\nwords that Tim presently found himself echoing them, and brought himself\r\nup with a jerk.\r\n\r\n“It's all haythen rubbish and cussing. The pore fule's daft wid the hate\r\nand the dust and the welt I give him. Shure it's the way I have to be\r\nsorry for the crature.”\r\n\r\nLike the refrain of an infectious song, the musical phrase would not be\r\nbanished from Tim's mind and lips, and so the tough, rough Irishman\r\nand the gentle exile from the Flowery Land went on their way, scarce\r\nconscious of the grimy miles, both dreamingly hailing the jewel in the\r\nlotus.\r\n\r\nThree days later the travel-stained pair arrived at Cooktown, where Hu\r\nDra--henceforth to be known officially and authoritatively, and in spite\r\nof all protest, as Tsing Hi--was duly consigned to the custody of the\r\nlock-up keeper, to await escort to the town where his sentence was to be\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n“He's that quare in his hid,” Tim informed Jock Egan, who now had\r\ncharge. “He's bin Tsing Hi-in and Hu Rah-in' and Paddy Om-in' (d'ye know\r\nthe maan, Jock?) all along the thrack till it's fair fascinated I am.\r\nAnd barrin' him bein' the very thafe o' the wurrld, it's a poor honest\r\nbody he be. Shure it's little enough truble he give me, and me all alone\r\nbe meself. An' the swag of him! Glory be to God, I dunno but it's wort\r\nfive hundred pounds if it's wort a sint! Yirra! but it's weery I am.\r\nIt's little slape I've had. Shure the whole beesely thrack be lousy wid\r\nshnaakes; and show me the man as cud slape shweet wid maybe four of the\r\nvarmint all ascroodging and squaaking nath his blanket!”\r\n\r\n“It's quare in yer head yerself,” ye're exclaimed Jock. “Be off to bed\r\nwid ye. If the sargint gets ye a-talkin' like that, he'll be afther\r\nthinkin' ye're in dhrink.”\r\n\r\n“Then, me sowl to glory; he'll jist be thinkin' fwhat I'm wishful for.\r\nIt's that farefull dhry up there on the Palmer I could dhrain a bucket.”\r\n\r\n“Get to bed, yer fool! Ye're talkin' that wild, ye'll have no care for\r\nyerself. It's meself that'll git the good woman beyant there to git ye a\r\ncup o' biling hot tay.”\r\n\r\nWith that Jock got him out, with papers all in order.\r\n\r\nHu Dra had disappeared from the tableland as suddenly but not as'\r\ntracklessly as a phantom. Lonely men in their tents and three or four\r\nmothers of families in their slab humpies looked out vainly for him for\r\nthree days, anticipating necessary vegetables, and, being disappointed,\r\nslandered him courageously, while they found consolation in the\r\nreflection that if he ever came his round again they would distress and\r\nvex him by withholding payments for the vegetables of the past. Not\r\na customer but owed him something. His country men gave notice of his\r\ndisappearance to the police, and black-trackers off-hand told a graphic\r\nand obvious story. Hu Dra had begun his weekly round when he had been\r\nattacked by myalls. They had capsized his baskets and wantonly battered\r\nthem to pieces. For him had been reserved the customary fate. He had\r\nbeen hustled off to the gorges contiguous to Hell's Gates, to be killed\r\nand eaten in peace and comfort. His hut, his cherished garden\r\nwere forthwith occupied and tended by another of the race-claiming\r\ncousinship. The newcomer even demanded payment of debts owing to his\r\nunfortunate relation, but the whole population sniffed with such vigour\r\nthat the claim was not persisted in. Once a Chinaman had left the\r\ndistrict unceremoniously, more especially at the forcible persuasion\r\nof flesh-hungry blacks, his dues lapsed by unanimous consent. He became\r\nmerely a fragrant remembrance. It is so still, and the virtue is as\r\nvirile as the odour of musk.\r\n\r\nTo himself Hu Dra was always so. Be his official and authoritative title\r\nfor the time being what it might, he was determined not to sacrifice his\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nThe gaoler found him a docile and obedient creature with an abiding\r\naffection for plants, which sprang up under his hands like magic.\r\nWithin two months corners of the desert yard began to blossom, to bear\r\ncucumbers and radishes, and to be fragrant with shallots.\r\n\r\nThe pride of the gentle gardener lay in a few plants of zinnias close\r\nto a dripping tap. In bright red, gold, and white, he accepted them as\r\nsubstitutes for the sacred lotus, and prison flowers never flaunted more\r\nfreely. As innocent as they, he deftly, tirelessly trained each plant,\r\ncaressed each opening bud, cherished it as if it were a jewel, and\r\nfound surcease of the pangs of exile, easement for the restraints upon\r\nliberty, and blissful consolation. Tendance upon the garden under the\r\nstrait shadow of wall was to him, not a duty, not a pastime, but a\r\nritual. The captive was happy, for here was the end of his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nExemplary conduct, combined with the art with which he forced salads\r\nfrom the boorish soils, found him favour and earned privileges and\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nHu Dra kept no count of the passing months. What was time to a\r\ncontemplative Buddhist whose being was permeated with the hope of\r\nrelease from delusions and sorrow and of attaining final sanctification?\r\n\r\nOne morning he was summarily marched into the presence of the big\r\nloud-voiced man whose orders were obeyed with instant smartness, who\r\ntold him, to his amazement and despair, that he must depart with his\r\nproperty. The seals of a sack were broken before him, and its contents\r\ndisplayed and duly accounted for--a sleeping-mat, a small red blanket,\r\nthe elastic-side boots, two scrolls of sinfully painted silk, a hard\r\nround hat stuffed with gaudy handkerchiefs, three watches and varied\r\njewellery in a ginger-jar, the quaintly carved toilet devices, the\r\njam-tin full of nuggets, and a chamois-leather bag delusively heavy with\r\nfine gold.\r\n\r\nThe same authority which had ordered his affairs ever since he had been\r\ntorn from the burnt hills now commanded him to begone.\r\n\r\nFor nigh upon two years he had dwelt passively in dream-land. This was\r\nbut another wonderment entrancingly agreeable. Without endeavouring to\r\nelucidate the incomprehensible, he accepted the gifts of the gods, and\r\nasked for a yellow zinnia. It was a reality, a guarantee, an assurance.\r\n\r\nGood, though gruff, the gaoler was wont to say that his departing guest\r\ngazed on the flower with almost religious fervour and mumbled over it\r\na prayer; and the gaoler's insight was true, for in comparison with a\r\nflower, the masonic emblem, the pride of Tsing Hi's life was to Hu Dra\r\nbut tinsel.\r\n\r\nIt passed all understanding.,\r\n\r\nHastening to escape from the land of bewilderment and easily gotten\r\nriches, Hu Dra-the quietest, the happiest, the wealthiest of a great\r\ncompany of his fellows boarded a steamer for Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany a long year after, Tim, who had blossomed into a sub-inspector,\r\nhad retired on pension, and had lost most of his brogue in the process,\r\nconfided in me the whole story.\r\n\r\n“You see, my friend, it was either the sack or Chinkee for me. I got the\r\nChinkee. There were plenty of 'em!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME'S FINGER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The more cleer and the more shynynge that Fortune is, the more brutil\r\nand the sooner breketh she.”--CHAUCER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh up on the auspicious shoulder of the Island mountain stands\r\nthe Sentinel, a coarse, truncated pinnacle of granite, roughened\r\nand wrinkled by the toll of the moist breezes, alternating with the\r\nscorching flames of the sun. It overlooks the league-long sweep of\r\nthe treacherous bay, with its soft and smothering sands, the string of\r\nislets of the Yacka Eebah group, while Bli and Coobie lie close under\r\nfoot, set in a swirling sea.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the Sentinel commands all the map-like detail of Pun-nul\r\nBay, with its labyrinthian creeks among a flat density of mangroves,\r\nlike lustrous, uncertain byways in a sombre field, erratic of shape,\r\nmagnificent of proportion. Beyond are many islets--dark blue on a\r\nlighter plain. In the distance, on the other hand, islands and islets\r\ntrail away until lost in the vague blending of sea and sky; and for a\r\nbackground is all Australia. In front alone does the Sentinel peer\r\nover uninterrupted space, and not always, for at times patches of white\r\nfiligree mark the outliers of the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nLooking up from Pun-nul Bay before sunrise, the base of the Sentinel\r\n'was swathed in white--night's rumpled draperies not yet tossed aside.\r\nAs the east glowed it stained the mist pink, and so warmed it that it\r\nparted into patches of luminous fluff which floated up and dissolved\r\ninto crystalline air, and the great lumbering rock stood naked and bold\r\nin the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the apex of a splintered peak beyond the Sentinel\r\nglittered, and that Chutter-murra Wylo, the one survivor of the\r\ntruculent natives, told once more of the wonderful stone for which\r\nmany had ventured, which had caused the disappearance of several, which\r\ndecoyed man and beast, and stored their bones close to the awful hole\r\nwhence issued the smoke which made the rain, and the dread lightning,\r\nand the thunder.\r\n\r\nNone ever ventured there now; but sometimes in the early morning the\r\nstone twinkled for a moment like a malignant sprite, watchful all night,\r\nbut abashed yet impudent to the authoritative sun.\r\n\r\nChutter-murra Wylo had so often indicated the exact locality of the\r\nstone, and had described its dire influence with such sincerity that,\r\nwhen it twinkled, a resolution which had been long in the back of my\r\nmind became wilful and imperative. He said that it was “on top, along\r\noo-nang-mugil”--a gloomy place among rocks--and that the old men of the\r\ncountry had been wont to say that this particular “oo-nang-mugil” was\r\nthe favourite resort of the “debil-debil,” the to whose arrogance and\r\nawful deeds the bones of man and beast bore terrifying testimony.\r\n\r\nBetween the Sentinel and a spur to the south is a narrow ravine, from\r\nwhich in the rainy season mist rises like jets of steam, and this\r\nwas the very spot whence the lightning and thunder ranged when the\r\n“debil-debil” lifted the mighty stone which blocked the entrance to\r\nthe cave of the winds. All about was fantastic ground, peopled by evil\r\nspirits who resented the intrusion of human beings and inflicted upon\r\ntrespassers peculiar punishments. Ill befell everyone who invaded that\r\nremote, almost inaccessible, uninviting region, at the very centre of\r\nwhich the alluring stone glittered. Of those who rashly determined to\r\ngaze at the prodigy at close quarters, some never returned. Those who\r\ndid come back were vexed with burning and smarting pains; they suffered\r\nillnesses; their skin broke out into blotches; they became old\r\nand enfeebled prematurely and all, whether they survived for a few\r\nirritating weeks or a few sad years, wore to the end a startled,\r\nawe-struck air. “That fella no more sit down quiet; him frait all time,”\r\n Wylo explained. And the stone was good to look at. Sometimes it was\r\nwhite like water; sometimes blue, like the sea; sometimes red, like\r\n“carrie-wy-in-gin” (sunrise). Sometimes it shook, and then it became so\r\nbright that the eyes were dazzled. The star-like stone had been on\r\nthe rock for all time, protected by distance and mystery. Was it not,\r\nindeed, the eye of the “debil-debil” who had custody of the lightning\r\nand thunder imps, and could it not be elevated or depressed like the\r\neye of a sand-crab? No intruder had ever escaped its vigil or the\r\nconsequences of his temerity.\r\n\r\nWe were camped under the lee of a low sand-dune, the top of which\r\ncommanded Pun-nul Bay. As the wind swayed its scalp-lock of twisted\r\nshrubs, the dune quivered, and rivulets of singing sand, almost as\r\nfluid and as unstable as water, trickled down, for it was one of the\r\nrubbish-heaps of the sea, over the brink of which waste was unceasingly\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nThe maze of mangroves whence weird hoots and bubbling cries and sharp\r\nclicks came at night, the stealthy sand marching over the land, the\r\nbarren slopes of the mountain, and the misshapen rock, gave one's\r\nthoughts a twist in the direction of the vague and mysterious. Wylo's\r\ncontinual harping on the wonderful stone renewed the old longing for\r\nadventure. He had seen it from a safe distance, but from the present\r\naspect only the indecorous glint at sunrise was visible.\r\n\r\nThe stone was a crystallised fact, but why had the blacks invested it\r\nwith such ill omen? Here was a worthy quest--a beautiful if not precious\r\ncrystal betokening the actual presence of a wary demon guardant over\r\nthe mouldering skeletons of Wylo's forefathers! What quest could be more\r\nsensational or likely to be so famously rewarded?\r\n\r\nWylo was prepared to climb the mountain to the base of the Sentinel,\r\nbut no higher. Secrets hidden from his intemperate, insistent gaze must\r\nsurely be inconsequent. Once and for all, the legend of the crystal\r\nmight be disposed of at the cost of two or three hours' climbing. I\r\nwould bring it back to prove to Wylo that no irreverent “debil-debil”\r\n would ever again blink at the sun from that particular spot. As for the\r\nskeletons, they were, without doubt, as mythical as the evil spirit, and\r\nin any case a few old bones were not to scare me from venturing to the\r\nboldly obvious summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWylo went wellnigh naked, carrying a day's provisions and the rifle. I,\r\ntoo, was lightly clad, but wore thick-soled boots, freely studded, and\r\nwith a tomahawk felt efficiently armed.\r\n\r\nBeyond the entanglement of the beach scrub the way was open, though\r\nrough, with granite boulders half hidden among rampant blady grass. The\r\ncountry was decidedly hostile to the climber, though far from actually\r\nforbidding, and with Wylo in the lead--for I held myself in reserve for\r\nthe final clamber up the ravine, to which the ascent to the base of the\r\nSentinel was merely a prelude--the pace was respectable and sure. Closer\r\nacquaintance forced a certain sort of respect for the Sentinel, which\r\nwas more massive, more venerable and time-worn than could be imagined\r\nfrom afar off, while all the scene below seemed softer and smoother and\r\nmore fairyland-like than in reality.\r\n\r\nHaving indicated what he deemed to be the direct route, and firmly\r\nresolving to take no risks by peering into the domain of the\r\n“debil-debil,” Wylo sat in the shadow of a huge boulder whence he could\r\ncommand a view of the entrance to the rock-bestrewn gorge. Not more than\r\neight hundred feet separated the spot from the summit of the peak. A\r\ncouple of hours at most and I would be down again, and, semi-seriously,\r\nI counselled Wylo to stop where he was until late in the afternoon, and\r\nif I had not then appeared to return to the camp, where he was to remain\r\nfor a couple of days, when he would be at liberty to make his way to the\r\nhead of the mangrove creek where the boat was anchored, with the design\r\nof bringing help to kill the “debil-debil” that detained me in his\r\nclutches. He was not too cheerful in his parting injunctions. “No\r\ngood you fight'm that fella. Suppose he catch'm you, he kill you one\r\ntime--finis. No good me come back. Me clear out quick!”\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness he undertook to “sit down” for two days, and\r\nfinally imparted advice which might enable me to out-manoeuvre the\r\n“debil-debil,” and either curb him or throw him out from his lair “with\r\nwondrous potency.” Up the gorge I would find a prickly bush, from which\r\nI was to cut a leafy branch as a frontal shield. Then, when the\r\nfiend swooped upon me, its long arms and pliant hands, furnished with\r\nneedle-like nails, would become embarrassed by the “nails,” of the\r\nbranch, and while it howled and danced I could “kill'm alonga leg” with\r\nthe tomahawk. I was to be careful not to look up, for the eye of the\r\n“debil-debil” was so bright and hot that it burnt up mortal sight,\r\nleaving the intruder a blind and hopeless victim.\r\n\r\nDiscreetly valorous, Wylo was quite enthusiastic, anxious, indeed, that\r\nthe quest should be accomplished by an audacious white man and at no\r\nrisk to himself. Therefore did I accept his counsel gravely, and in\r\nparting promised to bring down one of the hands of the long-standing\r\nterror of the mountain as proof that I had exacted the last penalty for\r\nmany demonic deeds.\r\n\r\nThus, good-humouredly, I began to clamber up the ravine through a\r\nperplexity of shrubs growing among loosely packed stones, thankful\r\nfor strong boots and hands toughened by the sun. Overhanging trees and\r\nshrubs almost converted the ravine into a tunnel, but here and there a\r\ngreenish light wrought changeful patterns on the gloomy rocks, and ferns\r\nof sombre green with unfolding fronds of ruddy brown occupied crannies\r\nand crowned rocks favoured by drips. No sound of animal life came to my\r\ncars, but an ever-increasing current of air was perceptible as the walls\r\nclosed in and became almost precipitous.\r\n\r\nThe narrow footway was swept bare of loose stones and vegetable rubbish,\r\nsave where the wet-season torrents had scooped out basins, or where a\r\nledge of resisting rock made a wet-season water fall. Such places had to\r\nbe discreetly scaled, for the rock was worn to polished smoothness and\r\nhand and foot holds were few and far between. Aerial roots, thin as\r\nwhipcord, hung from the branches of trees crowding on the brink of the\r\nravine, and with tasselled terminals sopped up moisture. A melancholy,\r\nhumming monotone pervaded the ravine, seeming to increase in\r\nremonstrance and warning the higher I ascended. Wylo had told of the\r\nnoise like a steamer's whistle a long way off. His local knowledge was\r\nbeing authenticated at every step. Such a sound was almost uncouth in\r\nsuch a locality; and there, overhanging a jutting angle of red rock, was\r\nthe predicted bush with keen prickles thickset on limber branches.\r\nHalf amused, I climbed to the spot, and, clinging precariously to the\r\nprincipal stem, cut off a branch which, falling into the ravine, slipped\r\nseveral yards down the smooth floor. It was not worth recovering, but\r\na certain half-humorous sense of obedience to the black boy's cautions\r\ninduced me to return for it; and as I trimmed off some of the prickles\r\nthat it might be grasped comfortably, a stone clattered down, bouncing\r\non the rock almost at my feet.\r\n\r\nA substantial mystery! What invisible agency had given this hard fact\r\nits force? A gleeful chuckle followed by a discordant crow dissipated\r\ndoubt-the stone had been dislodged by an industrious scrub fowl raking\r\non the brink of the ravine. A sense of fellowship with the harsh-voiced\r\nbird manifested itself. A transient sensation of relief--I had not been\r\nconscious of the least mental depression--followed the thought that in\r\nand about the ravine there were other living things besides myself and\r\nsnakes. The death adder, the head of which I had fatally bruised just\r\nnow, had been the only sign of life, and it had been as dull-coloured\r\nand almost as inert as the rock on which it lay--an emblem of death\r\nat home in this almost lifeless seclusion. Dwelling with amusement on\r\nWylo's suggested precautions, I bore the branch before me as I climbed\r\na steep face, the tomahawk in my belt, intent for the time being, and as\r\ncautious and suspicious as a black boy. On the lip of what seemed to be\r\na hollow a fig-tree grew, the naked, interlacing roots of which made the\r\nfinal stages of the ascent easy and safe. Briskly hauling myself up, I\r\nstepped over the edge of the depression, and the solid rock lapsed and\r\nslid underfoot.\r\n\r\nIn a flash the head of a python arose, and with gaping jaws struck as\r\nthe branch fell from my hand.' In a moment I had whipped the tomahawk\r\nfrom my belt and slashed at the body of the snake squirming at my feet,\r\nas, baffled for a moment by the falling branch, it gathered itself for a\r\nsecond attack.\r\n\r\nFew of the enemies of man are more easily disabled than a snake. Always\r\nzealous in obedience to the Biblical law, it is honest to confess to a\r\ndecided preference for elbow-room when engaged in its actual fulfilment.\r\nThis was a fight with man's first enemy in close and awkward quarters--a\r\nprecipice behind, walls of rock in front and at either hand. Three times\r\nmy length, strong enough to constrict to death a giant, wily enough to\r\nseek the cover of the matted roots of the tree, several points were in\r\nfavour of the snake. My first wild haphazard stroke, which had merely\r\nscored its flesh, seemed to have roused its vindictiveness. Once in\r\nthose coils, the chances of victory would be remote indeed.\r\n\r\nPart of the python's still gliding length was within reach, while (the\r\nforepart resting on a branch) the head was but slightly higher than\r\nmine, though beyond the radius of the tomahawk.\r\n\r\nThe bulging head drew slowly back, as the snake released sufficient of\r\nits length to encompass me. The yellow, blinkless eyes, with knife-edge\r\npupils, flashed with the hate of agelong feud as I edged against the\r\nwall. My arm was free. The lust of battle tightened every nerve. Neither\r\nflashing eyes nor strangulating length made for fear. The hitherto\r\nall-conquering snake, lord and master of the ravine, bade defiance,\r\njoining issue with the craft of its kind.\r\n\r\nSlowly the pendant portion increased as the subtle beast seemed to\r\nconcentrate all its energies on one triumphant, invincible effort.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the fateful instant, I slashed with all my force at the\r\nportion of the body within reach, ducking simultaneously. Shooting over\r\nme, the head of the enemy struck the rock with brain-bemuddling impact.\r\nFor once the serpent had been foiled. With jaws awry, the head swung\r\nlimply, like a ceasing pendulum. One blow with the back of the tomahawk\r\nestablished the right of man to wander at will among the rough and\r\nsecret places of the mountain.\r\n\r\nStill did the swaying reptile cling with a single coil round the\r\nfigtree's branch, while chill blood dripped and splashed among the\r\nintertwined and snake-like roots. A sudden tug brought the body down a\r\nsquirming mass. With rough-shod heel, I fulfilled the letter of the law,\r\nbruising the battered head, and then were revealed the bosses by which,\r\nwith the tail, the snake had sustained its dead weight.\r\n\r\nWas this the “debil-debil” which had scared so many from the quest--a\r\npython which any man might kill in the open without running any risk,\r\nand which a black boy, with time on his hands, would joy to eat? Yet I\r\nown that I was somewhat flustered, and not a little tired and bruised\r\nand angry, because such an impediment had had to be cleared from the\r\ntrack. Was there not cause for indignation? Why should a gormandising\r\nserpent, full to repletion, lie slothfully across a highway open to\r\nall, to the checking of a holiday-making mortal in lawful pursuit of\r\na demon-protected crystal? Let me once more vindictively stamp on its\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBut which way? Here was a dead and unscalable wall to right and left and\r\nin front, and all in deep shadow. I estimated that another one hundred\r\nfeet would take me to the mountain-top, whence it would be possible to\r\nsurvey the scene in relation to the bejewelled rock. Descent was the\r\nonly practicable preliminary towards further ascent. Utilising the\r\ninterlacing roots of the fig-tree, the way down was easy enough, and,\r\nchoosing the left wall of the ravine, I began a perilous climb out of\r\ngloom into sunshine, upon a conglomeration of immense granite boulders,\r\nover which the Sentinel cast a shadow. This shadow indicated that the\r\nascent had occupied at least three hours, and in my self-complacency\r\nI had calculated to beard the “debil-debil” in his den, dislodge the\r\ncrystal, and be back at the camp gloating over the escapade to open-eyed\r\nWylo in less time.\r\n\r\nThough a night was to be spent in the haunt of the evil spirit, yet\r\nwould I proceed. I found not one but many “oo-nang-mugils,” lowering\r\ncaves and clefts in which scores of fearsome “debil-debils” might lurk,\r\nbut which, as far as a vigilant mortal could detect, were given over to\r\ninnocent bats and those sun-loving swiftlets which rear their young in\r\nnests adherent to rocks in dusky places.\r\n\r\nOver and beneath boulders, squirming through bolt-holes and up flue-like\r\nopenings, bruised and with bleeding hands, at last the top was reached,\r\nharsh with granite, and there to the right, on a gigantic splintered\r\nboulder which seemed to block the end of the ravine and to peer down\r\ninto the blue bay below, was the crystal glinting in sunshine. It was\r\nnot more than fifty yards away, and, easeful of mind, I sat down to\r\nmunch a piece of damper. Close by a patch of vivid green moss indicated\r\nthe existence of moisture and the further possibility of water. Sure\r\nenough, twenty yards down spongy moss and fern spread over a lip of\r\nrocks, and from dangling tufts and drooping fronds water dripped in\r\nmelodious splashes into a shallow depression, and overflowed in a\r\nfan-shaped film. The facets and apex of the crystal reflected harsh\r\nbrightness as unsullied as the moss-filtered, unstable drips which\r\ngathered second by second and were gone. How like those drips, how\r\nunlike the scarred, time-chastened rock, that steadfast slip of light\r\nwhich since the dawn of creation had flashed messages across the\r\nunresponsive sea.\r\n\r\nFrom a ledge in which ferns and orchids grew in careless\r\nprofusion--bird's-nest fern and polypodium and white-flowering\r\norchid--the crystal might be reached by a little manoeuvring. But why\r\nhurry? Every minor crevice was embossed with spongy moss, from which\r\nsprang modest little flowers, a flower of mountaintops alone, lacking a\r\nfamiliar name, but which in its dainty form and rich mauve is none the\r\nless precious. While all the rest of the way had been barren or gloomy,\r\nhere was brave sunshine and space, a jewel-like crystal, and moss and\r\nferns and flowers, and calm and cool serenity which' bespoke remoteness\r\nfrom the “debil-debil” and all his works, and from the noisy cave of\r\nthe winds. Magic there was in plenty-the air tingled with it--that\r\nexhilarating, mind-expanding silence of mountain-tops which is the most\r\nthrilling magic of all.\r\n\r\nLeisurely glances at the mass of granite from which the crystal shone\r\nshowed that from the ferny ledge it would be beyond reach, and that\r\nunless care was exercised in the dislodgment it might fall among a\r\nconfusion of boulders far below and be lost for ever. My plan was of\r\nto build a buttress of loose stone on which to stand to tap it with the\r\ntomahawk. Like a miniature railway cutting, the ledge ran out on the\r\nface of the rock, so that standing upon it one looked down into the\r\nravine; but it was broad enough to afford safe and even convenient\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nAs a final preliminary to the beginning of operations, I clambered up\r\non to the ledge. Ferns grew among decaying vegetable matter in masses\r\ndifficult to push through. Polypodiums with brown, oak-leaf like,\r\ninfantile fronds clung tightly to the rocks with furry fingers, and the\r\nbirds'-nests were big enough to conceal a man. A broad and comfortable\r\npath it was, leading directly under the crystal, and with haste and\r\nconfidence I pushed along, smiling inwardly at “shynynge” fortune, to be\r\nin another moment dismayed by her “brutilness.” The earth sank under me.\r\nI shot into an acute fissure with ferns and dust piled overhead!\r\n\r\nGasping and coughing, I cleared away the smothering rubbish, to find\r\nmyself a fixture--jambed fast between walls of granite. Deceptive ferns\r\nhad masked the crevice. I had walked along a treacherous track until at\r\na weak spot it had given way as the gallows' trap beneath the feet of a\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\nLight came from ahead, too. There the lancehead-shaped fissure opened on\r\nthe ravine, whence it was flushed with cool air.\r\n\r\nWas ever mortal in such a plight? A drop of eight from the spacious\r\ntop of the mountain had lodged me a prisoner in the narrowest of cells.\r\nDismayed but not despairing, I struggled frantically, working with\r\nshoulder and arms against the walls of granite. The right foot was\r\nfirmly fixed, while a sensation of easiness was perceptible with regard\r\nto the left. Gently yet firmly, and fearful lest the slight grain of\r\ncomfort might be fraudulent, I felt the weight of my body on the left\r\nfoot, while scrutinising in detail the horrible trap into which the\r\ncrystal bait had lured me.\r\n\r\nThere, a few feet below and further towards the ravine, was the skull\r\nof a human being, and still further down, where space was more confined,\r\nother bones were fixtures. There was a weird fascination about the\r\nskull, for at noon it would receive the benediction of the sun, and the\r\ndiurnal glare into the secrets of the crevice had made a patch of white\r\ndesert in an oasis of grey mould. The bones below, green and earthly\r\nwith age, lay in disorder and confusion--poor fragments of the framework\r\nof man and harmless beasts, sharing a common fate.\r\n\r\nThough fast a prisoner, nothing to live on but hope and fresh air, a\r\nsense of relief, somehow, sometime, established itself in my mind.\r\nMost of the significant features of the adventure had been faithfully\r\nforetold by Wylo--the prickly bush, the snake (archetype of the fiend),\r\nthe mocking delusive stone, the stored bones of man and beast-all as he\r\nhad described. He must have known more than he had voluntarily told, and\r\nassuredly would he come', when he would coo-ee, and I would shout\r\nfor very joy. In the meantime would I possess my soul in patience and\r\nconserve all the strength of my lungs and power of endurance.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the platform of ferns a splash of lovely tints illuminated\r\nthe edge of the time-recording shadow--the solar spectrum produced by\r\nthe prism which had beckoned from afar. Was there no escape from the\r\nwizardry of the crystal? No hope of evading comparison of its beauty\r\nand permanence with the muddy and fleeting passions of mankind? Yet how\r\nfruitless its functions--to glorify for aeons the intractable rock,\r\nand to leave it ever unstained! For once in all the centuries may not a\r\nhuman hand be interposed between those ineffectual flames and the surly\r\nrock? Cannot even that small measure of space be overcome?\r\n\r\nA few inches from the tips of my outstretched fingers were the prismatic\r\ntints with which the crystal daily registered the decline of the day;\r\nbut not for all my striving and all my wit could I get within reach.\r\nThey were as remote as the creating sun!\r\n\r\nThe narrowness of the cleft forbade effort to reach down so that I might\r\nunlace my boots. There wan but one chance of deliverance--the coming of\r\nWylo. And would he, agitated by superstitious awe, dare to venture into\r\nthe haunt of the evil spirit when he began to realise that I, too, had\r\nfallen into the clutches he so much dreaded? Yet he must come! Of what\r\nspecial impiety had I been guilty that so rare and terrible a fate\r\nshould have been reserved for me. He must come!\r\n\r\nYes. Listen! I hear his coo-ee far below! He is making his way up the\r\nravine! And with, all my vocal power I coo-eed and yelled. But the\r\nmuffling rocks stifled all noise at lips. Listen! Yes! The sound\r\nagain--merely the mellow cadences of a swamp pheasant whooping among the\r\nblady grass.\r\n\r\nWylo dared not venture to the very door of the cave of the winds. I was\r\nalone with my fate! Could I master it?\r\n\r\nThe clean-cut shadow crept up the rock, and with it the colour splash\r\nreceded. As I gazed it glittered and was gone. It would not be visible\r\nagain until the next afternoon. Would I be here to watch it illuminate\r\nthe rock once more? Could I contain myself until then, and perhaps\r\nafter, and for day after day, until the last? And were my bones to\r\nbe added to the secret horde mouldering within a few feet of the\r\nmountain-top? A few feet of nothingness--mere empty space--separated me\r\nfrom lost and lovely liberty, and with frantic hands I strove against\r\nthe hard face of the rock, and cried aloud in agonising protest.\r\n\r\nThe old rock had disregarded similar protests and supplications, and had\r\nendured like infantile pushings! Call, and who shall listen? Push and\r\nshove and fight, and what availed it?\r\n\r\nIn my delirium I cursed and blasphemed, and “full of shriekynge was that\r\nsory place.”\r\n\r\nDarkness followed brief twilight, and up the ravine came the murmuring\r\nI had heard below--a sobbing sound which at first affrighted and then\r\nsoothed, for it could be nothing but the echo of the sea on the curving\r\nbeach below; and in its comfort that lulled all ineffectual clamour, and\r\neventually to fretful but frightful sleep. Always I awoke panting with\r\nthirst, stiff and strained, and with unmanly cries of fear and pain\r\non my lips, while the chaste stars danced across the narrow slit as I\r\nstrove to stem the turbid stream of despondency.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight a singular peacefulness possessed me, overcoming me in\r\nspite of myself. Feverish impatience and resistance seemed futile, and\r\nin my resignation I began to realise that to avert cramp and disablement\r\nfrom cold--for a chill, moist breeze from the ravine played continuously\r\non me--some sort of exercise must be undertaken.\r\n\r\nMy left foot was certainly not so compressed as the right. Though\r\nit could not be raised, it was possible to move it ever so slightly\r\nforwards and backwards. Might it not be possible, by never-ceasing\r\nfriction, to so abrade the edges of the sole of the boot that it might\r\nbe reduced to such dimension as would permit it to be raised?\r\n\r\nWith all the force of my mind concentrated on the one idea, I began to\r\nwork in a passion of patience. At first the play of the boot was hardly\r\nto be registered; but hour after hour of ceaseless and calculated effort\r\nnot only counterbalanced mental tension and imparted some degree of\r\nwarmth to my body, but so amended the shape of the boot that it began\r\nto move with some degree of freedom. The more easy the fit, the more\r\ncautious and calm I became.\r\n\r\nNo insipid monotony pervaded the remote, cold crevice. The operation was\r\nlubricated with hope. Once every heart-beat--for I kept strict tally, as\r\nfurther mental relaxation--my boot rubbed against the rock, and each\r\nrub wore away minute particles of leather. As time passed and the work\r\nbecame still easier, it became more engrossing, until calmness gave way,\r\nand every nerve thrilled with excitement, and I was convinced that\r\nI would win a joyful passage from this narrow strait by dint of the\r\nresolute continuation of the simplest of processes.\r\n\r\nBut the long night was not to end with such placid and entertaining\r\noccupation. Absorbed in it, sternly waving off all sense of weariness or\r\ndespair, I was staggered and stunned by the fall, among an avalanche\r\nof fern debris, of a heavy living body on my head and shoulders--a\r\ngrunting, struggling thing which kicked and scratched.\r\n\r\nWith a despairing shriek, 'all my vibrant nerves collapsed, as in the\r\ndarkness and confusion I fought against infernal odds. For one appalling\r\ninstant I was convinced of the reality of Wylo's most diresome fact, and\r\ndid furiously believe that I was actually entrapped in the stronghold of\r\na demon at that moment, intent upon tearing me limb from limb. The most\r\nfantastic and horrific of nightmares was actually materialised.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant a familiar odour sluiced away all mystery. This\r\nstruggling thing, from the shock of which my very soul still trembled,\r\nwas but a fellow-victim--a wallaby which, feeding along the ledge, had\r\nhappened on the trap made by my fall.\r\n\r\nIn a flash of remorseless energy, I seized the panting body, felt for\r\nthe throat, and, expelling pity from my heart, gripped until all was\r\nstill. How precious and comforting it was! And once again all my powers\r\nof will and muscle were centred on a single design and action as with\r\nmachine-like rhythm the boot wore itself against the rock. Disengaged\r\nfrom every other theme, my mind dwelt on the one steady, inevitable\r\npurpose. Rub! Rub! Rub! And I fancied I saw leathern dust fall like\r\nfilings from iron down deeper into the crevice. Before dawn the boot was\r\nworking freely, and with one arm on the compressed body of the wallaby\r\nto case my weight, rest was possible. The plan for the disengagement of\r\nthe right foot, painfully rigid and cold, was perfect in theory. Would\r\nit hold in practice? When the left was free I would, by friction of the\r\niron studs In the sole, wear away the laces of the engaged boot so that\r\nthe foot might be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nBut physical weakness became imperious. The distraction of cramped\r\nand bruised flesh had to be withstood the while the constancy of the\r\nfunction was maintained. Continual comfort came from the dead body of\r\nthe ill-fated wallaby--a sort of fellowship, and a feeling that with its\r\nco-operation the contest between living flesh and blood and the inert\r\nforce of the mountain was not altogether one-sided. Light was certainly\r\ncheerful, but the crevice filled with mist which distilled on the rock,\r\nand a chill current of air benumbed my aching limbs.\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of fierce determination the task persisted, until,\r\nquite unexpectedly as it seemed, the boot was free; and then, shoving\r\nand squeezing the wallaby as a cushion for my right arm, the sole of\r\nthe left boot began to rasp away at the instep of the right. In such a\r\nconstrained position the operation, which could be persevered in by fits\r\nand starts only, was exasperatingly slow. The sun sopped up the morning\r\nmist and boldly explored the crevice, revealing the marvellous precision\r\nof the space between the walls. No work of art could be more regular.\r\nThe sheer simplicity of the trap made it the more effectual. The\r\nsunlight showed, too, that the fissure was the skylight of a cave which\r\nopened out on the ravine. Dry boulders were strewn about fifty feet\r\nbelow, while ahead I could catch a glimpse of a narrow ribbon of blue\r\nsea. This provoking sight of unattainable water aggravated thirst almost\r\nbeyond endurance. Throughout the night had my longing increased, but\r\nnow the pangs were extreme. The most gratifying of all drinks--cool,\r\nfern-filtered, flower-decorated water, water dripping in iridescent\r\nspangles from green moss soft as velvet--splashed incessantly into a\r\nhollow out there a few yards away in the free space of the mountain.\r\nHere, manacled with “adamant eterne,” in an agony of impatience I\r\nquaffed the thirst-stimulating draught of unsatisfied longing as I\r\nstrove fitfully to wear away the stubborn strips of leather which held\r\nme in bondage. In a doze or dream the action went on. Startled, I awoke\r\nto find myself pommelling with inane savagery the poor crumpled body of\r\nthe wallaby, and to the realisation that the imprisoned foot was loose\r\nin the boot.\r\n\r\nA luxurious stupor took possession of my mind. I was at liberty to work\r\nout of the crevice knees and shoulders; yet an impalpable force detained\r\nme. It was not that I was not master of my fate, but that out there in\r\nthe glare of the sun was patient water, dripping for the refreshment\r\nand cleansing of my grimy lips. So enchanting a thought was not to be\r\nabruptly ended. Was it not deliciously dreamy to hold myself in\r\nsuspense awhile, to linger over anticipated sweetness and prolong blest\r\ngratifications indefinitely?\r\n\r\nStrange drowsiness and peace bewitched the sunlit chink. Why should I\r\nstruggle more? Could I not, in fancy, hearken to the measured splash of\r\nthe drops from the sodden moss? Could anything be more consoling than\r\nthis cushion to my bruised and aching arms? Ease and sloth were sweet\r\nindeed. I was free, but not at large. The amazing adaptability of the\r\nhuman mind had reconciled me in a few suffering hours to this confined\r\nspace. Verily do I believe that the overcoming of this subtle anodyne\r\ndemanded the expenditure of more vital force than the sum of all the\r\nlong-sustained automatic exertion by which I had won physical release.\r\n\r\nOne supreme mental tug and the baneful torpor was dispelled, and with\r\nstiffened legs and bruised hand@ I began to screw myself up to the free\r\nair cautiously and painfully; and there, in a beam of light from the\r\ncrystal, was the slow-dripping flower-bedizened water-celestial nectar\r\nto parched lips.\r\n\r\nHours after I awoke as from a dream. Far below a column of smoke showed\r\nthat Wylo still watched. My first act was to send up a responsive\r\nsignal. In a fit of petty passion I flung the toil-worn boot into the\r\nravine, and began the descent by way of the spur to the west.\r\n\r\nWylo seemed scared by the sight of the staggering and tattered\r\nscarecrow, barefooted, and stained with blood and dirt, who stumbled\r\ninto the camp at dusk, too weary to talk, almost too spent to eat;\r\nand to this day he is convinced that I was actually detained by the\r\n“debil-debil,” whom I had overcome by some means of which wonder-working\r\nwhite men alone have the secret.\r\n\r\nAfter two days' rest I climbed the mountain again, blocked the fissure\r\nwith loose stones, and built a buttress, standing upon which I tapped\r\nthe crystal gently with the tomahawk. It quivered. A shaft of rainbow\r\ntints dazzled my sight. I tapped again. As I touched it it third\r\ntime, the fragile finger with which the gaunt old rock had scorned the\r\nplodding centuries vanished in a splutter of spangles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL WITHIN THE STONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“These ghosts of the living and of the dead assuredly illustrate in\r\na striking manner the mysterious workings of the human mind, and the\r\nunsuspected influence of soul on soul.”--PRODMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot more than a hundred yards from its mud-besmeared mouth the\r\nconvenient mangroves disappear and the little creek assumes becoming\r\nairs. Huge tea-trees, with cushiony bark, straddle it, and ferns grow\r\nstrongly in all its nooks and bends. When the big trees blossom in\r\nwatery yellow, yellow-eared honey-eaters, blue-bibbed sun-birds, and\r\nscreeching parrots in accordant colours, assemble joyously, for the\r\naroma, as of burnt honey, spreads far and wide, bidding all, butterflies\r\nand jewel-backed beetles which buzz and hum, to the feast, until the\r\naerial anthem is harmonic to the rustle of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy feet of the trees stand in black peat, through which the\r\nwater from the wholesome hills oozes and dribbles, and the russet stain\r\nfrom discarded leaves is on their white bases. Russet, too, is the\r\nsurface of the ever moist soil. Some element in the water derived from\r\npacted roots of palm and fern tinctures whatsoever in it lies, so that\r\nthe bottoms of the shallow, erratic pools are thick with russet slime.\r\nAll above is bright and pure, and the water which flows over the\r\nslime-smudged roots limpid and refreshing. If you cut into the bark\r\nof the tea-tree you will find water in beads and trickles, water which\r\nsparkles with purity and has a slightly saline taste. The bare roots\r\nalone suffer defilement.\r\n\r\nMany a tall tea-tree stands sentinel on the margin of the creek, and\r\nthere are groves of slim palms with narrow truncated leaves--palms which\r\ncreep and sprawl over vegetation of independent character, and palm&\r\nwhich coquette with the sun with huge fans. Orchid& display sprays of\r\nyellowish-green flowers, which contribute a decided savour to the medley\r\nof scents, and palm-like Cycads meander from the low bank out Into the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nBut there is one tree which, if not superior to the rest in broadness\r\nof base, height, fairness of bark, and fullness of bloom, has especial\r\nendowment. It stands at the spot where generation after generation of\r\nthe original owners of the soil has crossed the creek, wearing a waving\r\npath upon which ferns ever encroach and which every flood amends. In a\r\nrecess in its massive roots reposes “Kidjo-bang,” the restless stone--a\r\nboulder, man's-head size, stained with a rim of sober brown.\r\n\r\nThis is its accustomed scat. It roves the locality, returning,\r\nswallow-like, to the close-fitting hollow of the root. The embraces of\r\nthe root are sometimes so strong that the dingy stone may not be moved.\r\nBut the floods of the wet season maintain an unceasing cataract to its\r\ndislodgment, and then, according to the legends of the blacks, it begins\r\nto “walk about.” It may rest a month just out of reach of the disturbing\r\nwater among the ferns. It has been known to appear mysteriously on the\r\nsandy beach two hundred yards away, to which spot it is said to travel\r\nby way of the grass lands, avoiding the slur of the muddy creek.\r\n\r\nWhether it seeks change of scene beyond the ripple of dead leaves and\r\nspoil of the flood, or whether it ventures out on to the open beach,\r\nwhere the breezes from the Pacific play upon it, the round white stone\r\nreturns, independent of the agency of man, to the sanctuary which time,\r\never-flowing water, and the hospitable roots of the tree, have combined\r\nto afford. It is there this day. Should it be taken to one or other of\r\nthe blue islands in the broad bay, sooner or later it will be discovered\r\nnestling cosily in the grotto in which the dyed slime smears it as with\r\npale blood.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary investigator of the whimsicalities of “Kidj-o-bang” the\r\nblacks betray no secret, though they would verify, with what to them is\r\nproof positive, that it does on occasion appear in unexpected places\r\nand unaccountably reoccupies its cell. Discreetly pursue the subject and\r\nperadventure you may be told precisely why the stone may not always rest\r\nin the one spot in the whole world which it fits as a kernel its shell.\r\nIt has been, they assert, associated with an evil deed of which it is\r\nnow the emblem. Among the many the mysteries of “Kidj-o-bang” dwell\r\nwith the past, though it is still associated with the ceremonies of the\r\nbestowal of totemic names on the children of a certain father.\r\n\r\nMore than one legend concerning it is extant, and the young fellows of\r\nthe present day frankly scoff at them all, while the old men believe\r\neach other's versions and repeat them with bated breath. They cannot\r\ndiscredit stories which were accepted as established facts when they\r\nwere young, which no one then ever dreamed of doubting, and which\r\nprovide a comfortably satisfactory account for otherwise perplexing\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\nMusing on the spot, the legend of the roving stone usurped my thoughts.\r\nThe trivial and uncertain notions of the black boy who was the first to\r\ntell it, and by theatrical gestures to illustrate its verities, became\r\nmore and more indistinct. The soothsayers of the long past had been\r\nforbidden by Nature to doubt that which was the lore of the camp. Was it\r\nthat Nature re-asserted her influence--that the essences of the scene,\r\nsubtle and pervasive, had recurred, creating a receptive spirit, so\r\ndeep a religion of assent that shadow and substance intermingled to my\r\nbewilderment? I was permitted to be a sensitive percipient in the midst\r\nof the ashes of shiftless folk who had passed away, catching but a\r\ncasual and deceptive glimpse of the coming of the desolating white man.\r\n\r\nPiln-goi, the black boy, had wandered up the creek. A thrilling silence\r\nprevailed. Stooping down, I laved my hands in the softly flowing water,\r\nidly intent on lifting the stone. The tawny slime defeated irresolute\r\nefforts, and my slipping hands bestowed a baptismal splash.\r\n\r\nInstantly I became conscious of a strange presence, and, glancing\r\nover my shoulder, saw an unfamiliar black boy lurking behind a\r\nglistening-fronded Cycad.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene had undergone wishful transformation. The white-barked\r\ntrees, purified of smears from the sooty fingers of fire, stood out in\r\nsplendid contrast to a richer, thicker, a flowery undergrowth. Tall fern\r\ntrees spread green cobwebs to entrap sunbeams. The Cycad under which the\r\nboy crouched was slim-shaped, and its foliage resembled that of one of\r\nthe most beautiful of ferns, with languorous, dolorous fronds, while it\r\nwas crowned with a huge fruit of golden-brown. All the scene had\r\nbeen wondrously transfigured. Time's treacheries had been defeated.\r\nA garden-like age had been restored. The sword-leaved orchid dangled\r\nyard-long sprays of brilliant yellow flowers, which saturated the air\r\nwith delicate perfume. Fearless birds fluttered among and hovered over\r\nthe pendant blooms, whistling and calling. Water-rats sported in the\r\nlily-bespangled stream, and a platypus basked, on the bank.\r\n\r\nFrom the strained and expectant attitude of the boy, it was apparent\r\nthat he was hunting. He stepped cautiously out of cover, and, using a\r\nwommera of dark wood with oval clutches of white shell, threw a spear\r\ninto the long grass. A kangaroo, mad with fear and pain, staggered\r\nforward, knowing not whence fate had struck it, and, lurching\r\nhelplessly, sank among the ferns on the margin of the water. Ignoring my\r\npresence the boy, having completed the hunter's office with a blow from\r\na nulla-nulla, called in a thin, shrill voice:\r\n\r\n“Yano-lee!” (We go this way).\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds a young girl of his own race stepped through the leafy\r\nscreen. She cast casual glances at the dead kangaroo, and without saying\r\na word to her companion came to the pool, stooped down beside me, and\r\ndrank eagerly and noisily, using a scoop improvised from a leaf. Her\r\nback glistened with perspiration, and her coarse, fuzzy, uncleanly hair\r\nceased in tufts on her neck. It was a slim and shapely little figure.\r\nThe plumes of the orchid, golden and syrupy, swayed over her heedless\r\nhead and seemed to caress it. Her eyes, round, large, and brimful of the\r\nbewildering eagerness of youth, relieved the unobtrusive expansiveness\r\nof her nose and almost atoned for her savage lips. Though almost\r\ntouching me, the most shy, wild creature of the bush seemed unconscious\r\nof my presence. She was in fact and deed:\r\n\r\n“We have the receipt of fern-seed; we walk invisible.” I was the\r\nphantom--invisible, intangible. The pair beside, the unembarrassed\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\nDo phantoms reflect? That privilege was mine. Let memory treasure every\r\ndetail of the scene, every vestige of its incidents.\r\n\r\n“Kidj-o-bang” had vanished. There was its cell. A full and stainless\r\nstream, in a gurgling cataract, sparkled over the big root, while high\r\namong the blossoms birds clambered incessantly for nectar.\r\n\r\nThe primitive pair were at home, but not at case, In this Garden of\r\nEden. They spoke in mumbling tones, of which I could catch but stray\r\nphrases, though I listened eagerly. Presently the girl took up two\r\ndry sticks, and, using one as a drill between the palms of her hands,\r\nessayed to make a fire.\r\n\r\nThe boy imperatively intervened. “Poo-nee imba!” (No fire).\r\n\r\nThe girl started up, and instantly both slid into the jungle as silently\r\nand as tracklessly as snakes.\r\n\r\nThe dead kangaroo, the expectant phantom (gifted for the time being with\r\na faculty more subtle than any moral sense), remained alone among the\r\nbirds and the orchids, while shy pencil-tailed water-rats began to sniff\r\nand peer among the sedges. So enthralling was the scene that time passed\r\ninsensibly. The sun was overhead when the pair reappeared noiselessly.\r\nSmears of shell and grit betrayed an intervening meal of oysters. Swarms\r\nof green ants, in a scramble for food, almost obscured the blood-stains\r\non the fur of the kangaroo, and, brushing them away, the boy made and\r\nenlarged with his fingers an opening in the body, and having torn out\r\nthe heart, liver, and kidneys, made a fire, scarce a hand's-breadth wide\r\nand smokeless, on which the meat was singed prior to being munched with\r\ngrim deliberation. They ate largely, some of the flesh from the hind\r\nquarters being also eaten, scrap by scrap.\r\n\r\nWere they fugitives? Tall and strong, the boy was as alert and\r\nsuspicious as a dingo. Every sense was strained. He seemed intent upon\r\nsubduing the very noises in his head as he slowly crushed his food and\r\ngulped.\r\n\r\nA forlorn cry, half appeal, half gurgle, filtered through the leafage as\r\nfrom the beach, and on the instant the jungle had soundlessly absorbed\r\nthe affrighted pair. The handful of fire and the mutilated kangaroo\r\nremained as the only evidences of the handiwork of man.\r\n\r\nWhat of the intruder? The cry was almost too weird to be human. Again it\r\nthrilled through the leafage, a trifle stronger, and seemed to convey a\r\nthreat commingled with a prayer for succour.\r\n\r\nThe scene held me. I was powerless, but not indifferent; capable of\r\nsight, incapable of action or utterance. Something in the tone of the\r\nvoice told of a member of my own race in sore distress. Yet I could not\r\nrespond to his appeal or move to his aid.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour of intense silence passed, and then a lusty shout startled\r\nthe air. Surely, I thought, the wayfarer who makes such outcry in this\r\nunpeopled wilderness is an uncouth fellow who has lost his way and\r\nthinks to dialogue with echoes for relief of loneliness. Presently the\r\ncracking of branchlets and a rumble of discontented phrases told of\r\nsomeone blundering along through the mangroves. Accustomed to the\r\ngentle sounds and the delicious silence of the jungle, the clumsy noises\r\nirritated while preparing me for the sight of the intruder--a big,\r\naggressive, weather-scored man, his only clothing a pair of short pants\r\nof canvas, stained with wear and stiff and whitened with frost like\r\nsea-salt. The ocean had but an hour ago cast him like its scum on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nHe burst on the scene to plunge his broken lips into the water at my\r\nfeet. Like the natives, he drank long and noisily, and when his thirst\r\nwas allayed called to an imaginary mate--“Pietro, Pietro!” cursed freely\r\nwhen no answer came, and whimpered like a babe.\r\n\r\nHuge of body, strong of limb, bully and brute stamped on his coarse\r\nfeatures, yet did his dread of loneliness piteously overcome him. His\r\nbald pate, hung about with scant reddish ringlets, had been roasted by\r\nthe tropic sun until it glowed, and eyes and nose strove for supremacy\r\nof inflammation. An unkempt moustache did not hide teeth of disreputable\r\ntint; chin and jowl were covered with a fortnight's growth of streaky\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nTurning from the water, he saw the dismembered kangaroo, and, seizing\r\none of the legs, tore the flesh from the bones and with ravenous greed\r\nbegan an uncleanly feast. The impure drank of the pure water and gulped\r\nthe strong flesh until his gorged stomach swelled cask-shape, and then\r\nhe slept as noisily as he had eaten and drank.\r\n\r\nA leathern belt, cracked and whitened, furrowed his distended girth,\r\nand as he lay stretched with the sun scrutinising his face, flies and\r\nmosquitoes and carnivorous green ants feasted on his blood at will.\r\nEach leaden-tinted, lean fly revelled until it assumed similitude to\r\na colouring grape, some “reeled to and fro and staggered like drunken\r\nmen”; bloated mosquitoes and green ants, commingling, made a living\r\nmosaic on the skin of the unconscious man. What could the assaults and\r\nstings of myriads of insects avail against fatigue so formidable?\r\n\r\nBut a decree had gone forth that the sleeper should wake, and who is man\r\nthat he should flout imperious commands? The merciless sun insisted. The\r\nstrong man fidgeted under the persistent blaze. Perspiration poured from\r\nhis skin; he snarled; his eyelids twitched and quivered; the veins\r\nof neck and forehead throbbed ominously. The sun does not tolerate\r\ndisobedience. A thin trickle of blood issued from the grimy nose, and\r\nwith a snort the man awoke, his flame-red eye% swilled with enforced\r\ntears. Dazedly he plunged his head into the water and drank greedily,\r\nand, sitting up, spat sullenly and with signs of disgust and contempt.\r\nWhat comfort could cold water afford so repleted a stomach?\r\n\r\nHaving disdainfully spurned the remnants of the kangaroo, he sat head\r\nbetween knees, grumbling against fate. To him the fruitful and pleasant\r\nland was disconsolate. A castaway, he had drifted on to its welcome\r\nshores, and all that it could offer was loneliness, cold water, the raw\r\nflesh of a strange animal, and denial of the solace of sleep. Out of the\r\ndepths of his misery and dejection he called imperatively on his God,\r\nand taking from the lining of his belt a thumb-sized purse, of netted\r\nsilver, displayed a glorious pearl, which he held aloft, and with an\r\nadmixture of supplication and imprecation proffered it to the Most High\r\nas grudging ransom from a God-abandoned country.\r\n\r\nWho is there that delights not in the susceptible purity of pearls? The\r\ngem which symbolises virginal placidity was like to be contaminated by\r\nthe coarse handling of the fretful, bargaining castaway.\r\n\r\nDid I lean forward acquisitively to accept it from the noisome fingers,\r\nreluctant that so serene a prize should be retained in so coarse a\r\nsetting?\r\n\r\nThe man started, for the votive offering had vanished, and blasphemous\r\nlamentations and curses against the Supreme Being, whom he abused for\r\ndefrauding him of fortune by trickery, shocked the quietude. Then a\r\nspasm of religious fervour jerked him to his knees as he patronised the\r\nAlmighty for having accepted a pledge for safe-conduct from death-like\r\nsolitude. After transports of impious piety, as uncouth and boisterous\r\nas his struggles through the labyrinth of mangroves to the purifying\r\nwater, he sat bareheaded in the sun.\r\n\r\nSteamy heat distilled strong aromatic odours from the myriad leaves;\r\nlanguid flowers gave copiously and of the best of their fragrance; ferns\r\nand lotus did obeisance to high noon. The birds had ceased to whistle,\r\nand the droning of bees gave to the upper air slumbering rhythm of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAgain the intruder slept. Again the sun commanded and he woke raging.\r\nStanding, he cursed both loud and long, eyes protuberant, face purpling\r\nunder the strain of vindictive oaths.\r\n\r\nWhat an unflattering contrast to the unclad natives who had dominated\r\nyet blended with the scene-the girl the prototype of a swaying palm, the\r\nboy that of a tough young bloodwood beside the creek, among the topmost\r\nbranches of which a crimson-flowered mistletoe made a splash of colour\r\nin harmony with the single red feather from the wing of a black cockatoo\r\nwhich the soft-tongued youth had entangled in his hair.\r\n\r\nThis gross, profane, sun-smitten, sea-rejected herald of civilisation,\r\ndisowned by his fellows, disinherited of the world, defiled the spot,\r\nand his voice created an inaugural discord.\r\n\r\nWith arms uplifted, he muttered ineffectual curses against his fellows,\r\nupbraided his saints, and defied his deity. But while his lips frothed\r\nwith the passion of a stuttering tongue, the provoked but just genius\r\nof the spot passed sentence, and swiftly and silently the messengers of\r\nDeath came. Four slender spear& penetrated his shaggy chest, as with\r\na &cream which ended lit a gulp he splashed back into the water. His\r\nstruggles and splutterings soon ceased. Silence resumed its fascination.\r\n\r\nBlood welled from the mouth and nose and spear wounds, which the eager\r\nwater carried off in wavy, independent streams, while the dead face\r\nwhitened.\r\n\r\nMany minutes elapsed before a dozen white-eyed natives cautiously oozed\r\nthrough the Jungle, stimulating each other's nervousness by reassuring\r\ngestures. Certain that the trespasser on their dominion was incapable of\r\nmischief, they began to chatter, showing fidgety interest in the body,\r\nwhich they touched and poked fearsomely with spears.\r\n\r\nDead eyes stared unblinkingly at the sun through a curtain of water,\r\nwhich had already cleaned them of heat and passion, and wisps of red\r\nhair drifted over the forehead.\r\n\r\nThe untimely yelp of a dingo some few yards in the jungle inspired a\r\nsimilar response from one of the men, and without shyness or reserve the\r\nboy and girl joined the throng, and all began to talk excitedly. Some\r\nof the men assumed threatening attitudes towards the girl, who stood\r\nsubmissively, while the boy talked in a rage of excitement. He had\r\nchosen his mate, and would not, even on pain of summary death, abandon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSo trivial an incident as the love affairs of boy and girl could not\r\ncompare with the phenomenon in the water. The crisis was momentary.\r\nAmazement was pictured in every face, and not a man but subjected the\r\nbleeding body to gross contempt and what passed among them for ridicule.\r\nThey mimicked the high stomach as they stood, as the dead man had stood,\r\nwith arms aloft in rebellion against his lot, and fell back, as he had\r\nfallen, screaming, to kick and wallow on the ground. Here was plot and\r\nmatter for ludicrous corroboree, the first rehearsal of which took place\r\non the scene.\r\n\r\nSoon curiosity took possession of the unstable actors. The belt was\r\nremoved, and on the purse being fumbled with, several small pearls fell\r\nout. They were disregarded; but the strong man of the party looped the\r\nbelt about his own inadequate waist, the girl hid the purse (which had\r\nbeen passed from hand to hand) in her hair, while the men tore the bone\r\nbuttons from the pants and fitted them into their ears as they strutted\r\nfoppishly.\r\n\r\nThe dead eyes stared defiantly up into the sky, the face whitened, and\r\nthe stains of blood seemed to settle on it.\r\n\r\nA harsh sound came as an electric shock, and I heard as from afar off\r\nPiln-goi shout:\r\n\r\n“You bin sleep long time, boss! Big low water. We fella look out\r\npearl-shell!”\r\n\r\nThe scene had resumed everyday aspects. The sun concentrated its rays on\r\nmy head through a rift in the jungle, and the stone, stained dull red,\r\nlay in its cell, while rootlets fringed with tawny slime wavered over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHad soul communed with soul on that illusive borderland we range in\r\ndreams, the emblem of a deed of blood eloquent to reveal its secret? And\r\nnow that the tale is told, will it cease from bewildering the simple old\r\nmen of the soil who with one hand grapple the magical past and with the\r\nother the realities of the present?\r\n\r\nPiln-goi's impatience drew me from the spot and out on to the reef laid\r\nbare by the ebb. The beguiling pearl still eludes him, but memory holds\r\na rarer treasure than all the fecund sea contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd",
