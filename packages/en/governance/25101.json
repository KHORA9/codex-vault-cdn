II.--DECEMBER, 1862.--NO. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April last, upon the recommendation of the President of\r\nthe United States, Congress offered pecuniary aid to such States as\r\nwould gradually abolish slavery within their limits. The colonization,\r\nfrom time to time, of the manumitted slaves, with their consent, by the\r\nGovernment, beyond our boundaries, was also contemplated as a part of\r\nthe system. By the President's proclamation of September last, this\r\noffer is still made to loyal States, and practical measures suggested\r\nfor carrying it into execution. As to the States persisting in rebellion\r\nafter the close of this year, the President, as a military necessity,\r\nhas announced a different measure, that is, general emancipation in all\r\nsuch States, with compensation only to loyal masters. Immediate\r\nemancipation of all slaves, with compensation for all, costing, as it\r\nwould, twelve hundred millions of dollars, is now beyond the power of\r\nthe Government, burdened as it is by an enormous and increasing debt.\r\nNor was such a measure ever wise or expedient. That subject I will\r\ndiscuss hereafter, but will speak now of the plan proposed by the\r\nPresident, and sanctioned by Congress on the 10th of April last.\r\n\r\nIf this measure seems slow in securing total manumission and\r\ncolonization, it would be progressive and certain. God works out the\r\ndestiny of nations by no sudden or spasmodic action. His great and\r\nbeneficent changes are generally slow and gradual, but when he wills\r\ndestruction, it is sudden as the lightning's flash, the crash of the\r\nearthquake, or the sweep of the hurricane, marked by ruin and\r\ndesolation. Would we avoid like disasters in solving this stupendous\r\nproblem, we must follow, in humble faith, the ways of God, and thus by\r\ngentle, but constant and successive movements, reach the grand result.\r\n\r\nHistory, however, exhibits a few extraordinary cases, in which man, as\r\nan instrument in the hands of Providence, sometimes punishes great\r\ncrimes, eradicates great evils, and accomplishes great national reforms\r\nby acts as sudden as the devastating career of the tempest in sweeping\r\naway pestilential vapors. Such may be the case with the revolted States,\r\nif they should persist in this wicked rebellion beyond the close of the\r\nperiod of solemn warning.\r\n\r\nThe coming year may be the great crisis of human destiny. It may see our\r\nrivers, like those of Egypt, turned into blood. It may witness similar\r\nloathsome plagues, and pestilence, and fiery hail, and darkness\r\npalpable. But may it never behold the dread work of the destroying angel\r\nas of old, at the midnight hour, in every dwelling whose lintels were\r\nunmarked by the typical blood of the Paschal sacrifice! Avoiding the\r\nlast dread scene of the great Egyptian drama, may we have, not the\r\nJewish Passover, but the grand American jubilee, when we may hail the\r\nSouth redeemed from the curse of slavery, and forever united with the\r\nNorth, as the one blessed home of universal freedom.\r\n\r\nAs the South was as earnest as the North in protesting against the\r\nlanding upon our shores of the first cargo of African slaves, and the\r\ncontinuance of the traffic so long forced upon us under the British\r\nflag, and as they all united in excluding the word 'slave' from the\r\nFederal Constitution, so will they ultimately coöperate in expunging\r\nfrom our system the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nI shall discuss this question as to the border States under no sectional\r\nor party aspect, no influence of passion or prejudice, or any motive but\r\nthe desire to promote the good of my country. Our national and material\r\ninterests must be fully considered, as also those great moral principles\r\nand intellectual developments which exalt and dignify the character of\r\nman. I shall examine the subject inductively and deductively, the facts\r\nand the causes.\r\n\r\nThat a return to the Union with gradual emancipation and colonization by\r\nthe rebel States would be best for them and for us is certain. But in\r\njustice to loyal citizens and communities, and to avoid the danger of\r\nforeign intervention by prolonging the contest, it is our duty, after\r\nthe close of this year, to withdraw the slaves in the rebel States from\r\nthe culture of the crops used to support their armies, which can only be\r\ndone by general emancipation in such States persisting then in the\r\nrebellion. This is a necessary war measure, designed, like battles or\r\nblockades, to suppress the rebellion (alike ruinous to North and South),\r\nand which must no longer be permitted to accumulate an immense debt and\r\noppressive taxation, and to exhaust our blood and treasure. The census\r\nshows that very few slaves are held by the deluded masses of the South,\r\nthat the slaveholders are few in number; and full compensation is\r\ncontemplated by Congress and the President, in all cases of the\r\nmanumission by us of the slaves of loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1790, all the sixteen States then enumerated held\r\nslaves, except Massachusetts (then including Maine, although numbered\r\nseparately), where the institution was abolished by a judicial\r\nconstruction of their constitution of 1780. The following table, from\r\nthe census, shows the gradual disappearance of slavery from seven of\r\nthese States, the remaining eight States still continuing the\r\ninstitution:\r\n\r\n                1790    1800    1810    1820    '30  '40  '50 '60\r\n   N. Hamp.      158       8\r\n   R. Island     952     381     108      48     17    5\r\n   Conn.       2,759     951     310      97     25   17\r\n   Vermont        17\r\n   N.

An effort was\r\nmade in Congress to defeat the admission of Illinois, on the ground that\r\nits constitution 'did not conform to the ordinance of 1787.' But it was\r\nthen decided by the House of Representatives (117 to 54) that 'the\r\nordinance did not extend to States.' In the Senate the vote was\r\n_unanimous_. (See Niles's Register, vol. xix. p. 30.) Rhode Island\r\nadopted the Pennsylvania system. Connecticut declared free, at the age\r\nof 26, all born after the 1st March, 1784. Indiana pursued in its\r\nresults the course of Illinois. By the census, Illinois had 917 slaves\r\nin 1820, 747 in 1830, 331 in 1840; and Indiana had 190 slaves in 1820, 3\r\nin 1830, and 3 in 1840. New York in 1799 continued in bondage the\r\nslaves then living, but those born _after_ the date of the law were\r\nemancipated at the age of 28; and in New Jersey, the males at 25 and the\r\nfemales at 21. This slow and gradual process in States having so few\r\nslaves, should inculcate kinder and more indulgent feelings as to those\r\nloyal communities where the slaves are so much more numerous, and the\r\ntime and mode of action so vital.\r\n\r\nThe great model act of gradual emancipation, drawn by Benjamin Franklin,\r\nthe great leader on this question, approved by the Quakers, and adopted\r\nby Pennsylvania in 1780, liberated all the descendants of slaves born\r\nafter that date within the limits of the State. To avoid circumlocution,\r\nI shall call those born before the date of emancipating laws the _ante\r\nnati_, and those born after the date of such laws, _post nati_.\r\n\r\nI shall consider first the question of gradual emancipation and\r\ncolonization in connection with Maryland, and afterward apply the same\r\nprinciples to other States.\r\n\r\nIf the Pennsylvania system of liberating immediately only the post nati,\r\nso much more liberal than that of most of the free States, were adopted\r\nby Maryland, the cost of manumission there would be very small. In the\r\nexecution of the emancipation act of Congress in this District, infant\r\nslaves were valued officially this year by sworn experts at $50 each.\r\nNow by the census of 1860, the infant slaves of Maryland, under one year\r\nold, surviving on the 1st June, 1860, numbered 2,391, which, at $50\r\neach, would cost $119,550. This would be the actual expense for the\r\nfirst year in Maryland, but decreasing every year, and ceasing\r\naltogether in little more than a generation. Now the total number of\r\nslaves under one year of age, born in all the slave States, and\r\nsurviving on the 1st June, 1860, was, by the census, 113,581, which, at\r\n$50 each, would cost $5,679,050, for the first year, and decreasing\r\nannually as above stated. The post nati numbered in Delaware 40, in\r\nKentucky 7,281, in Missouri 3,377, and in Virginia 13,850, making the\r\nfirst year's cost as follows:\r\n\r\n   Maryland               $119,550\r\n   Delaware                  2,000\r\n   Kentucky                364,050\r\n   Missouri                168,850\r\n                          --------\r\n                           654,450\r\n   Virginia                692,500\r\n                        ----------\r\n                Total,  $1,346,950\r\n\r\nNow then, applying this principle to Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, the cost, the first year, would be $654,450, and, if we\r\nincluded Virginia, $1,346,950. This sum, we have seen, would decrease\r\nevery year. According then to the annual tables, and those of\r\nexpectancies of life (as calculated for me), the sum of fifteen millions\r\nof dollars of United States stock, issued now, and bearing interest at\r\nthe rate of six per cent, per annum, would make all the border States\r\nfree States, in the same sense in which Pennsylvania and other Northern\r\nfree States became so; and less than half this sum, if Virginia should\r\nnot adopt the measure. The case, then, as regards the border States,\r\npresents no financial difficulty whatever. If this plan were adopted,\r\nthe same just and humane course would doubtless be pursued as in the\r\nNorth, by which the emancipated post nati would remain apprentices until\r\nthey reached twenty-one years of age, under the same regulations,\r\nmainly, as were applicable to white children, bound out by the overseers\r\nof the poor. Should the border States consent to proceed more rapidly, I\r\nhave no doubt the Government would cheerfully pay to loyal masters such\r\nadditional sum as would give freedom to _every slave_ in all the border\r\nStates, on the 4th of July, 1876, our first centennial anniversary of\r\nthe Declaration of American Independence. That day, then, already so\r\ndistinguished in the annals of humanity, would become the great epoch in\r\nthe history of our race.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us examine the cost of all these measures. If the seceded\r\nStates, including Virginia, should persist in the rebellion until after\r\nthe close of this year, the sum to be paid the loyal owners of slaves\r\nmanumitted under the President's war proclamation would probably reach\r\n$100,000,000. The emancipation of the post nati, in the four remaining\r\nborder States, would cost §7,288,132. The manumission in those States,\r\nof all the surviving slaves, on the 4th July, 1876, according to the\r\nsame tables and estimates, would cost a sum equal to $65,000,000, issued\r\nnow as United States six per cent. stock, making a total for _complete\r\nemancipation in all the slave States_ of $172,288,132. This is a smaller\r\nsum than four months' cost of the war, whilst wholly and forever\r\nremoving the discordant element which produced the rebellion, commencing\r\na new and glorious career of material, moral, and intellectual progress,\r\ngreatly exalting the character of the nation, invoking the blessing of\r\nGod, securing the future harmony and perpetuity of the Union, and the\r\nultimate fraternity of man. Never, before, would any nation have made so\r\ngrand an investment in the gratitude of emancipated millions, the thanks\r\nof a world redeemed from bondage, the applause of the present age and of\r\nposterity--the exchequer of time and eternity. It would live forever in\r\nhistory, and the recording angel would inscribe it in God's eternal\r\narchives. Statesmen, scholars, savans, philosophers, poets, patriots,\r\norators, and divines would proclaim its glory. The new drama of man's\r\npolitical redemption would be witnessed by the audience of the world.\r\nMusic would chant its praise in every clime, and all peoples would swell\r\nthe chorus. The painter would give it immortality, and the sculptor\r\nmonuments more enduring than the pyramids, statues more godlike and\r\nsublime than ever crowned Grecian Parthenon, or adorned with Parian\r\nmarble the temples of Augustan Rome. The press would glow with\r\nenthusiasm, and the procession of nations march in the grand ovation,\r\nnot to national airs, or under national banners, but under the world's\r\nnew flag, and to the music of the world's new anthem of universal\r\nfreedom and regenerated man.\r\n\r\nThe census proves that our progress as a nation has been greatly\r\nretarded by slavery. If the North had retained, and the South had\r\nabolished slavery, their relative positions would have been reversed.\r\nVirginia would have taken the place of New York, Maryland of\r\nMassachusetts, Delaware of Rhode Island, Kentucky of Ohio, Missouri of\r\nIllinois, and Tennessee of Indiana.\r\n\r\nI begin with Maryland, because, in proportion to her area, she has\r\ngreater natural advantages than any one of the thirty-four States, and,\r\nif the comparison with the free States is most unfavorable to her, it\r\nwill be more so as to any other Southern State, as the census shows\r\nthat, from 1790 to 1860, and from 1850 to 1860, Maryland increased in\r\npopulation per square mile more rapidly than any other slaveholding\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMaryland borders for two hundred miles the great free State of\r\nPennsylvania, and Delaware one hundred and thirty miles, whose slaves\r\nhave decreased from 8,887 in 1790, to 1,798 in 1860, and where slavery\r\nnow exists in name only. Delaware, like Maryland, is also a loyal State,\r\nand would be the last to leave the Union, which it was her glory first\r\nto enter under the Constitution of 1787. On the west, Maryland is\r\nbounded by Preston county, Virginia, containing in 1860 a free\r\npopulation of 13,312, and 67 slaves only. Western Virginia, bordering\r\nMaryland on the south, has voted with great unanimity to become a free\r\nState, and all appearances indicate that slavery will disappear from\r\nVirginia with the close of this year. Maryland then would be surrounded\r\nentirely by non-slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nWithin the heart of Maryland stands this District, where slavery is now\r\nabolished, producing serious losses and embarrassments to the State. The\r\ntwo counties of Prince George and Montgomery, adjoining this District,\r\ncontained in 1860, 17,790 slaves, being more than one fifth of the\r\nslaves of the State. How long can slavery endure, and of what value is\r\nit in these counties, where every slave brought or sent to the District\r\nis free, and where it is already seriously contended that the language\r\nof the Constitution, 'slaves in one _State_, escaping into _another_,'\r\ncannot apply to this District? With the feeling so intensified already\r\nby this rebellion against slavery, it cannot long exist in Maryland. By\r\nadvancing legislation, and public sentiment, the fugitive slave law is\r\nbecoming inoperative, and slaves in Maryland are now held by a most\r\nprecarious tenure. Indeed, unforeseen events, as this terrible rebellion\r\nprogresses, may sweep slavery from Maryland without compensation or\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\nBut, independent of present or future perils, it is proposed to prove,\r\nmainly by the census, that all the material interests of Maryland would\r\nbe greatly promoted by her prompt acceptance of the offer of Congress.\r\nWe must consider the area, soil, climate, mines, hydraulic power,\r\nlocation, shore line, bays, sounds, and rivers, and such other causes as\r\naffect the advance of wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThe relative progress of Maryland has been slow indeed. The population\r\nof the Union, by the census of 1790, was 3,929,827, of which Maryland,\r\ncontaining then 319,728, constituted a twelfth part (12.29). In 1860,\r\nthe Union numbered 31,445,080, and Maryland 687,034, constituting a\r\nforty-fifth part (45.76). In 1790, the free States numbered 1,968,455,\r\nMaryland's population then being equal to one sixth (6.12); but, in\r\n1860, the population of the free States was 18,920,078, Maryland's\r\nnumber then being equal to one twenty-seventh part (27.52). But, if\r\nMaryland had increased as rapidly from 1790 to 1860 as the whole Union,\r\nher proportion, one twelfth part, would have made her numbers in 1860,\r\n2,620,315; and if her proportional increase had equalled that of the\r\nfree States, her ratio, one sixth, would have made her population in\r\n1860, 3,153,392. She might not have reached either of these results;\r\nbut, before closing these articles, it will be proved that, in the\r\nabsence of slavery, her population, in 1860, would have been at least\r\n1,755,661, or the same per square mile as Massachusetts; and Baltimore,\r\nbearing the same ratio to this number as to Maryland's present\r\npopulation, would have contained in 1860, 542,000, instead of 212,000,\r\nher present number.\r\n\r\nI take the areas from the able report (November 29, 1860) of the Hon.\r\nJoseph S. Wilson, then Commissioner of the General Land Office, where\r\nthey are for the first time accurately given, 'excluding the water\r\nsurface.' The population is taken from the census, the tables of 1850\r\nand 1860 being compiled with great ability, by the present\r\nsuperintendent, the Hon. J. C. G. Kennedy. I compare first Massachusetts\r\nand Maryland, because they are maritime and old States, and both in 1790\r\nhad nearly the same population, but, as will be shown hereafter, with\r\nvastly superior natural advantages in favor of Maryland.\r\n\r\nArea of Maryland, 11,124 square miles; shore line, by tables of United\r\nStates Coast Survey, viz.: main shore, including bays, sounds, &c., 503\r\nmiles, islands 298, rivers to head of tide water 535; total, 1,336\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nArea of Massachusetts, 7,800 square miles; shore lines, by tables of\r\nUnited States Coast Survey, viz.: main shore, including bays, sounds,\r\n&c., 435 miles, islands 259, rivers to head of tide water 70; total, 764\r\nmiles. When we mark the Potomac and its tributaries, the lower\r\nSusquehanna, the deep and numerous streams of the Chesapeake, the\r\ncommercial advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts are vast indeed.\r\nLooking at the ocean shore of Maryland, and also at the Chesapeake bay,\r\nthe largest and finest estuary in the world, indented with numerous\r\nsounds and navigable inlets, three fourths of its length for both shores\r\nbeing within Maryland, and compare this deep and tranquil and protected\r\nbasin, almost one continuous harbor, with the rock-bound coast of\r\nMassachusetts, lashed by the stormy Atlantic, the superiority of\r\nMaryland is striking.\r\n\r\nMortality in Maryland, by the late census, viz.: deaths from 1st June,\r\n1859, to 31st May, 1860, 7,370 persons. Same time in Massachusetts,\r\n21,303; making the ratio of deaths to the number living in Maryland, one\r\nto every 92, and in Massachusetts one to every 57; and the percentage of\r\ndeaths in Maryland 1.09, and in Massachusetts 1.76. This rate of\r\nmortality for Massachusetts is confirmed by the late official report of\r\ntheir Secretary of State to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAs to area, then, Maryland exceeds Massachusetts 43 per cent.; as to the\r\nshore line, that of Maryland is nearly double that of Massachusetts,\r\nhaving 68 miles more of main shore, bays, and sounds, 38 miles more for\r\nislands, and nearly eight times the number of miles for rivers to head\r\nof tide water. As to climate, that of Maryland, we have seen, is far the\r\nmost salubrious. This is a vast advantage, not only in augmented wealth\r\nand numbers, from fewer deaths, but also as attracting capital and\r\nimmigration. This milder and more salubrious climate gives to Maryland\r\nlonger periods for sowing, working, and harvesting crops, a more genial\r\nsun, larger products, and better and longer crop seasons, great\r\nadvantages for stock, especially in winter, decreased consumption of\r\nfuel, a greater period for the use of hydraulic power, and of canals and\r\nnavigable streams. The area of Maryland fit for profitable culture is\r\nmore than double that of Massachusetts, the soil much more fertile, its\r\nmines of coal and iron, with the fluxes all adjacent, rich and\r\ninexhaustible; whereas Massachusetts has no coal, and no valuable mines\r\nof iron or fluxes. When we reflect that coal and iron are the great\r\nelements of modern progress, and build up mighty empires, this advantage\r\nof Maryland over Massachusetts is almost incalculable. The hydraulic\r\npower of Maryland also greatly exceeds that of Massachusetts. Such are\r\nthe vast natural advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts. Now let us\r\nobserve the results. Population of Maryland in 1790, 319,728; in 1860,\r\n687,034; increase 367,300. Population of Massachusetts in 1790, 378,717;\r\nin 1860, 1,231,065--increase 852,348; difference of increase in favor of\r\nMassachusetts, 485,048; excess of Massachusetts over Maryland in 1790,\r\n58,989, and in 1860, 544,031. This result is amazing, when we regard the\r\nfar greater area of Maryland and her other vast natural advantages. The\r\npopulation of Maryland in 1790 was 28 to the square mile (28.74), and in\r\n1860, 61 to the square mile (61.76); whereas Massachusetts had 48 to the\r\nsquare mile in 1790 (48.55), and 157 to the square mile in 1860\r\n(157.82). Thus Massachusetts had only 20 more to the square mile in\r\n1790, and 96 more to the square mile in 1860. But if the areas of\r\nMaryland and Massachusetts had been reversed, Massachusetts, with the\r\narea of Maryland, and the population of Massachusetts of 1860 to the\r\nsquare mile, would have numbered then 1,755,661, and Maryland, with the\r\narea of Massachusetts and the population of Maryland of 1860 to the\r\nsquare mile, would have had then a population of only 481,728 upon that\r\nbasis, leaving Massachusetts in 1860, 1,273,393 more people than\r\nMaryland. Thus is the assertion in a former part of this article now\r\nproved, 'that in the absence of slavery, the population of Maryland in\r\n1860 would have then been at least 1,755,661, and Baltimore at least\r\n542,000.' But, in view of the many other natural advantages of Maryland,\r\nas shown in this article, viz.: in climate and salubrity, in shore line\r\nand navigable rivers, in fertility of soil, and hydraulic power, in a\r\nmore central location for trade with the whole Union, and especially\r\nwith the West, and nearer supplies of cotton, and, above all, in coal\r\nand iron, it is clear, in the absence of slavery, Maryland must have\r\ncontained in 1860 a population of at least two millions. By the census\r\nof 1790, Massachusetts was the fourth in population of all the States,\r\nand Maryland the sixth; but in 1860, Massachusetts was the seventh, and\r\nMaryland the nineteenth; and if each of the thirty-four States increases\r\nin the same ratio from 1860 to 1870, as from 1850 to 1860, Maryland will\r\nbe only the twenty-fifth State.\r\n\r\nThese facts all conclusively attest the terrible effects of slavery on\r\nMaryland, and this is only one of the dreadful sacrifices she has made\r\nin retaining the institution. As to wealth, power, and intellectual\r\ndevelopment, the loss cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\nNor can manufactures account for the difference, as shown by the still\r\ngreater increase of the agricultural North-West. Besides, Maryland\r\n(omitting slavery) had far greater natural advantages for manufactures\r\nthan Massachusetts. She had a more fertile soil, thus furnishing cheaper\r\nfood to the working classes, a larger and more accessible coast, and\r\nnearly eight times the length of navigable rivers, greater hydraulic\r\npower, vast superiority in mines of coal and iron, a far more salubrious\r\nclimate, cotton, the great staple of modern industry, much nearer to\r\nMaryland, her location far more central for trade with the whole Union,\r\nand Baltimore, her chief city, nearer than Boston to the great West,\r\nviz,: to the Ohio at Pittsburg and Cincinnati, the Mississippi at St.\r\nLouis, and the lakes at Cleveland, Toledo, and Chicago, by several\r\nhundred miles. Indeed, but for slavery, Maryland must have been\r\na far greater manufacturing as well as commercial State than\r\nMassachusetts--and as to agriculture, there could be no comparison.\r\n\r\nBut Massachusetts did not become a manufacturing State until after the\r\ntariff of 1824. That measure, as well as the whole protective policy,\r\nMassachusetts earnestly opposed in 1820 and 1824, and Daniel Webster, as\r\nher representative, denounced it as unconstitutional. From 1790 to 1820\r\nMassachusetts was commercial, not manufacturing, and yet, from 1790 to\r\n1820, Massachusetts increased in numbers 144,442, and Maryland in the\r\nsame time only 87,622. Yet, from 1790 to 1820, Massachusetts, the most\r\ncommercial State, was far more injured by the embargo and the late war\r\nwith England than any other State.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the accusation of the secession leaders that the\r\nNorth was built up at the expense of the South, by the tariff, can have\r\nno application to the progress of Massachusetts and Maryland, because\r\nthe advance of the former over the latter preceded by more than thirty\r\nyears the adoption of the protective policy, and a comparison of the\r\nrelative advance of the free and slave States, during the same period,\r\nexhibits the same results.\r\n\r\nThere is one _invariable law_, whether we compare all the slave States\r\nwith all the free States, small States with small, large with large, old\r\nwith old, new with new, retarding the progress of the slaveholding\r\nStates, ever operating, and differing in degree only.\r\n\r\nThe area of the nine free States enumerated in 1790, is 169,668 square\r\nmiles, and of the eight slaveholding States 300,580 square miles, while\r\nthe population of the former in 1790 was 1,968,455, and of the latter,\r\n1,961,372; but, in 1860, these nine free States had a population of\r\n10,594,168, and those eight slave States only 7,414,684, making the\r\ndifference in favor of these free States in 1860 over those slave\r\nStates, 3,179,844, instead of 7,083 in 1790, or a positive gain to those\r\nfree States over those slave States of 3,172,761. These free States,\r\nenumerated in 1790 and 1860, were the six New England States--New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and the slave States were, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky--yet we have seen that the area of those slave States was\r\nnearly double that of those free States, the soil much more fertile, the\r\nclimate more salubrious, as shown by the census, and the shore line,\r\nincluding main shore, bays, and sounds, islands and rivers, to head of\r\ntide water, was, for those free States, 4,480 miles, and for those slave\r\nStates, 6,560 miles. Thus, it is clear, that the increase of population\r\nof these slave States should have far exceeded that of those free\r\nStates. The population of these slave States per square mile in 1790 was\r\nsix (6.52), and in 1860, 24 (24.66), and of those free States in 1790,\r\nwas 11 per square mile (11.60), and in 1860, 62 per square mile (62.44).\r\nThus, while the increase of those slave States from 1790 to 1860 was\r\nonly 18 per square mile, that of those free States was nearly 51 per\r\nsquare mile (50.84), or in very nearly a triple ratio, while in wealth\r\nand education the proportionate progress was much greater.\r\n\r\nNo cause except slavery can he assigned for this wonderful difference,\r\nfor the colonists of Maryland were distinguished for education,\r\nintelligence, and gentle culture. Lord Baltimore was a statesman and\r\nphilanthropist, and his colony was a free representative government,\r\nwhich was the first to repudiate the doctrine of taxation without\r\nrepresentation, and the first to introduce religious toleration. While\r\nMaryland has produced many of the most eminent soldiers, statesmen, and\r\njurists, her relative decline in power, wealth, and population, has been\r\ndeplorable, and is attributable exclusively to the paralyzing effect of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nWhile the advance of Massachusetts, with her limited area and sterile\r\nsoil, especially in view of the thousands of her native sons who have\r\nemigrated to other States, is one of the wonders of the world, yet, the\r\nrelative increase of the population of New Jersey, from 1790 to 1860,\r\ncompared with that of Maryland, is still greater than that of\r\nMassachusetts. The law is inflexible wherever slavery disappears.\r\nPopulation of New Jersey in 1790, 184,139, in 1860, 672,035, being an\r\nincrease of 264 per cent. (264.96) for New Jersey, of 225 per cent.\r\n(225.06) for Massachusetts, and for Maryland 114 per cent. (114.88). The\r\nratio of increase per square mile from 1790 to 1860 was: Massachusetts,\r\n48.55 in 1790, and 157.82 in 1860; Maryland, 28.74 in 1790, and 61.76 in\r\n1860; and New Jersey, 22.01 in 1790, and 80.70 in 1860. Thus, while\r\nMaryland from 1790 to 1860, little more than doubled her ratio of\r\nincrease per square mile (28.74 to 61.76), and Massachusetts a little\r\nmore than tripled her ratio (48.55 to 157.82), New Jersey very nearly\r\n_quadrupled_ hers (22.01 to 80.70). It must be conceded, however, that\r\nthe natural advantages of New Jersey are far greater than those of\r\nMassachusetts, whose material and intellectual progress, in defiance of\r\nsuch serious obstacles, now is, and, most probably forever will be,\r\n_without a parallel_. Now the area of New Jersey is but 8,320 square\r\nmiles; the soil of Maryland is far more fertile, the hydraulic power\r\nmuch greater, the shore line much more than double, viz.: 531 for New\r\nJersey, to 1,336 for Maryland; while New Jersey, with rich iron mines,\r\nhas no coal, and one third of her area is south of the celebrated Mason\r\nand Dixon's line, the northern boundary of Maryland. The comparison,\r\nhowever, which I shall present hereafter, of New York and Virginia, will\r\nbe the most astounding, while little less remarkable will be found that\r\nof North Carolina with Pennsylvania, Kentucky with Ohio, Tennessee with\r\nIndiana, Georgia and Missouri with Illinois, Arkansas with Michigan,\r\nAlabama and Texas with Iowa or Minnesota, Mississippi and Louisiana with\r\nWisconsin, Delaware with Rhode Island, South Carolina with Maine or\r\nVermont. All, however, prove the _same law_, and exhibit the same\r\nparalyzing effect of slavery. While the free States have accomplished\r\nthese miracles of progress, they have peopled seven vast Territories\r\n(soon by subdivision to become many more States), immigration to which\r\nhas been almost exclusively from the North, as compared with the South.\r\nIt is clear, that if the South retains the institution, it will, before\r\nthe close of this century, sink into comparative insignificance, and\r\ncontain less than a sixth in population of the Union. After the\r\ncalamities which slavery has brought upon the South, the ruin and\r\ndesolation the rebellion has already accomplished there, who from the\r\nNorth or from Europe would hereafter immigrate to any State retaining\r\nthe system?--while thousands of the native sons of the South have\r\nalready fled North or to Europe, and hundreds of thousands will follow.\r\n\r\nThe slave State which has increased _most_ rapidly to the square mile of\r\nall of them from 1790 to 1860, has had a smaller augmentation per square\r\nmile than that free State which has increased most _slowly_ per square\r\nmile during the same time of all the free States, and the result is the\r\nsame as to wealth and education also. Under the _best_ circumstances for\r\nthe slave States, and the _worst_ for the free States, this result\r\nproves the uniformity of the rule (like the great law of gravitation),\r\nknowing no exception to the effect of slavery, in depressing the\r\nprogress of States in population, wealth, and education. Would we then\r\nin all these advance more rapidly, we must remove slavery and negroism,\r\nthe retarding cause. I know it is asked, how shall we then cultivate the\r\ncotton lands of the South without slaves? This does not apply to the\r\nborder States; but before closing these letters, I will prove\r\nconclusively, by the census and other statistics, what, from long\r\nresidence in the South, and from having traversed every Southern State,\r\nI know to be true, that cotton is now raised there most extensively and\r\nprofitably by non-slaveholders, and upon farms using exclusively white\r\nlabor. Indeed the cotton raised on small farms in the South where there\r\nare no slaves and exclusively by free white labor, commands a price from\r\nfive to ten per cent. greater than the slave grown cotton. In Texas,\r\nespecially, it is a great truth, that skilled, educated, persevering,\r\nand energetic free labor, engaged voluntarily for wages or its own use,\r\nwould, in time, when aided by improved culture and machinery, produce\r\nmuch larger crops and better cotton than now raised by the forced and\r\nignorant labor of slaves, and at a much cheaper rate, at a far greater\r\nprofit, than any crop now produced in the North, and in a more\r\nsalubrious climate. In western Texas, counties on the same parallel with\r\nNew Orleans, and a little north and south, cultivated mainly by Germans\r\nwithout slaves, produced large quantities of the best cotton, and the\r\nsupply with augmented labor might be increased almost indefinitely.\r\nHaving thrice visited Texas, and traversed nearly the whole State,\r\nnorth, south, east, and west, I speak from personal knowledge. In one\r\ncounty, I observed first rate wheat, cotton, and sugar cane growing in\r\nadjacent fields, and the soil and climate well adapted for all three\r\ncrops. In Texas, the product of wheat has increased from 41.79 bushels\r\nin 1850, to 1,464,273 bushels in 1860, and the number of bales of cotton\r\nfrom 58,072 in 1850, to 405,100 bales in 1860, far exceeding the rate of\r\nincrease in any other State. (See table of Census, No. 36, pp. 200,\r\n210.) Having very nearly six times the area of New York, Texas, when\r\ncultivated by free labor, can produce cotton enough to clothe the people\r\nof the world, and supply all Europe with wheat also. The rapid\r\ncolonization of Texas by freemen ought to add to our wealth, in this\r\ndecade, a sum equal to the present debt of the United States, and\r\nterminate in our favor the effort to supplant us in the supply of cotton\r\nfor the world.\r\n\r\nThe isothermals of the great Humboldt (differing so widely from\r\nparallels), which trace the lines of temperature on the earth's\r\nsurface, prove, as to heat, the climate of the South (running a line\r\nfrom Charleston to Vicksburg) to be substantially the same as that of\r\nGreece and Italy--each, in its turn, the mistress of the world. I know,\r\nwhen, the term _isothermal_ was used in my inaugural as Governor of\r\nKansas, it was represented by some of our present rebel leaders, to the\r\nmasses of the South, as some terrible monster, perhaps the Yankee sea\r\nserpent; but I now use the term again in no offence, from its important\r\napplication to the present case, and knowing that what I now advise\r\nwould produce incalculable benefits to the whole country, but especially\r\nto the South. Indeed, if Texas, with her 274,356 square miles of area,\r\nwith her salubrious climate, and fertile soil, already worked to a great\r\nextent by free labor, were a free State, she would, in time, contain a\r\nlarger population than any State of the Union. Texas has much more than\r\nfive times the area of England proper, and, with the same population to\r\nthe square mile, would contain more than one hundred millions of people.\r\nHaving, in 1837, offered in the Senate of the United States, and\r\ncarried, the resolution, recognizing the independence of Texas, first\r\nproposing in my letter of the 8th January, 1844, the mode, by _compact_\r\n(alone practicable), by which, on my motion, Texas was admitted into the\r\nUnion, distinctly advocating, in this letter, the reannexation of Texas,\r\nwith, a view to secure the ultimate disappearance of slavery and\r\nnegroism from the whole country, in opposition to the object officially\r\navowed by Mr. Calhoun, to annex Texas for the purpose of perpetuating\r\nslavery, I shall, in a future letter, discuss this subject, involving\r\nnot only our furnishing a certain abundant supply of cheap cotton, but\r\nsecuring the real monopoly of this great product, due to our _peculiar_\r\nsoil and climate, and thus ultimately increasing our products and\r\nmanufactures thousands of millions of dollars, and giving us the control\r\nof the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nIf Maryland would only initiate this policy, and come now to the rescue\r\nof the Union from rebellion and foreign intervention, she would inscribe\r\nher name first of all the States on the page of history and in the\r\ngratitude of our country and mankind. The position of Maryland upon the\r\nChesapeake, the Potomac, the Susquehanna, and Atlantic, is most\r\ncommanding. She surrounds the Capitol. It was her own noble donation,\r\nand she is its natural guardian and sentinel. Her waters, cutting the\r\nBlue mountains and the Alleghany, flow into the Atlantic and\r\nMississippi, thus making her an eastern and a western State. Throughout\r\nall her borders, not a citizen would lose anything by the change\r\nproposed, but all would be enriched. Take down the barriers of slavery,\r\nand a new and unprecedented current of population and capital would flow\r\ninto the State. Property would rise immensely in value, the price of her\r\nlands would soon reach those of Pennsylvania, new towns and cities would\r\nspring into life, Cumberland would soon equal the great manufacturing\r\nsites of the North, and the railroad to Pittsburg would soon be\r\ncompleted. Baltimore would fulfil her mighty destiny, and the present\r\ncanal _up the Susquehanna_, easily enlarged, so as to equal the grand\r\nwork of New York, would connect her with Lakes Erie and Ontario. That\r\ncanal already unites the Susquehanna from the Chesapeake with the lakes\r\nby the Seneca route (as it should by the Chenango also), and only\r\nrequires to be enlarged to the extent of the Erie Canal, and the locks\r\nalso, as wisely proposed in regard to that great work. This would at\r\nonce develop the great iron and coal mines of the Susquehanna\r\n(anthracite and bituminous), supply western and central New York, and\r\nthe great region of the lakes, and the Chesapeake with these articles,\r\nso essential in war and peace. Let the locks of the Erie Canal be\r\nenlarged as proposed, and the ship canal from the Illinois river to\r\nChicago constructed; but in justice to Pennsylvania and Maryland, as\r\nvastly important for commerce and revenue, and as a war measure for the\r\ncheap construction of iron-clad gunboats in the great coal and iron\r\nregion, and the defence of the lakes, the Chesapeake, the Delaware, the\r\nAlbemarle, and of the _capital of the Union_, let this canal be enlarged\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWhile this system of gradual emancipation would greatly promote the\r\nmaterial interests of Maryland, and of all the border States, the\r\nPresident does not overstate its influence in crushing the rebellion and\r\nrestoring peace.\r\n\r\nMaryland, the border States, and the South would then indeed commence a\r\nnew career of progress, by removing slavery and negroism; and their\r\naugmented wealth, and that of the whole country, would soon return to\r\nthe Government, in increased revenue, a sum far exceeding the cost of\r\ngradual emancipation and colonization. Indeed, if, as a mere financial\r\nquestion, I was devising the most effective plan for liquidating the\r\nnational debt and reducing our taxes, it would be thus vastly to augment\r\nour wealth and population by adopting this system.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1860 exhibits our increase of population from 1790 to 1860\r\nat 35.59 per cent., and of our wealth 126.45. Now, if we would increase\r\nthe wealth of the country only one tenth in the next ten years, by the\r\ngradual disappearance of slavery and negroism (far below the results of\r\nthe census), then, our wealth being now $16,159,616,068, the effect of\r\nsuch increase would be to make our wealth in 1870, instead of\r\n$36,593,450,585, more than sixteen hundred millions greater, being more\r\nthan three times our present debt, and in 1880, instead of\r\n$82,865,868,849, over three billions six hundred millions more, or more\r\nthan seven times our present debt.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of this letter, it will be shown that the difference,\r\n_per capita_, of the annual products of Massachusetts and Maryland\r\nexceeds $120. As to the other Southern States, the excess is much\r\ngreater. Now, if the annual products of the South were increased $120\r\neach _per capita_ (still far below Massachusetts) by the exclusion of\r\nslavery, then multiplying the total population of the South, 12,229,727,\r\nby 120, the result would be an addition to the annual value of the\r\nproducts of the South of $1,467,567,240, and in the decade,\r\n$14,675,672,400; the first amount being three times our debt on the 1st\r\nJuly, 1862, and the last sum thirty times our debt on that day. This\r\nchange would not be immediate, but there can be no doubt that, with the\r\nvastly greater natural advantages of the South, the superiority of free\r\nto slave labor, the immense immigration, especially from Europe to the\r\nSouth, aided by the Homestead bill, and the conversion of large\r\nplantations into small farms, an addition of at least one billion of\r\ndollars would be made, by the exclusion of slavery, to the value of the\r\nproducts of the South, in the ten years from 1870 to 1880, which sum is\r\nmore than double our public debt on the 1st July last.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the relative progress in population of Massachusetts\r\nand Maryland, I will now examine their advance in wealth.\r\n\r\nBy tables 33 and 36, census of 1860, the value of the products of\r\nMassachusetts that year was $283,000,000; and of Maryland, $65,583,000.\r\nTable 33 included domestic manufactures, mines, and fisheries (p. 59);\r\nand table 36, agricultural products. Dividing these several aggregates\r\nby the total population of each State, the value of that year's product\r\nof Massachusetts was $229.88 _per capita_, and of Maryland, $95.45,\r\nmaking the average annual value of the labor of each person in the\r\nformer greatly more than double that of the latter, and the gross\r\nproduct more than quadruple. This is an amazing result, but it is far\r\nbelow the reality. The earnings of commerce and navigation are omitted\r\nin the census, which includes only the products of agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, the mines, and fisheries. This was a most unfortunate\r\nomission, attributable to the secession leaders, who wished to confine\r\nthe census to a mere enumeration of population, and thus obliterate all\r\nthe other great decennial monuments which mark the nation's progress in\r\nthe pathway of empire.\r\n\r\nSome of these tables are given as follows:\r\n\r\n_First, as to Railroads._--The number of miles in Massachusetts in 1860\r\n(including city roads) was 1,340, and the cost of construction\r\n$61,857,203 (table 38, pp. 230, 231). The value of the freight of these\r\nroads in 1860 was $500,524,201 (p. 105). The number of miles of railroad\r\nin Maryland at the same time was 380, the cost of construction\r\n$21,387,157, and the value of the freight (at the same average rate)\r\n$141,111,348, and the difference in favor of Massachusetts $359,412,883.\r\nThe difference must have been much greater, because a much larger\r\nportion of the freight in Massachusetts consisted of domestic\r\nmanufactures, worth $250 per ton, which is $100 a ton above the average\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe passengers' account, not given, would vastly swell the difference in\r\nfavor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe tonnage of vessels built in Massachusetts in 1860 was 34,460 tons,\r\nand in Maryland, 7,798 tons (p. 107).\r\n\r\nThe number of banks in Massachusetts in 1860 was 174; capital,\r\n$64,519,200; loans, $107,417,323. In Maryland, the number was 31;\r\ncapital, $12,568,962; loans, $20,898,762 (table 34, p. 193).\r\n\r\nThe number of insurance companies in Massachusetts 117; risks,\r\n$450,896,263. No statement given for Maryland, but comparatively very\r\nsmall, as the risks in Massachusetts were nearly one sixth of all in the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOur exports abroad, from Massachusetts, for the fiscal year ending 30th\r\nJune, 1860, were of the value of $17,003,277, and the foreign imports\r\n$41,187,539; total of imports and exports, $58,190,816; the clearances\r\n746,909 tons, the entries 849,449; total entered and cleared, 1,596,458\r\ntons. In Maryland, exports $9,001,600, foreign imports $9,784,773; total\r\nimports and exports, $18,786,323; clearances, 174,000 tons; entries,\r\n186,417; total of entries and clearances, 360,417 (table 14, Register of\r\nTreasury). Thus, the foreign imports and exports abroad, of\r\nMassachusetts, were much more than triple those of Maryland, and the\r\nentries and clearances very largely more than quadruple. The coastwise\r\nand internal trade are not given, as recommended by me when Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, but the tables of the railroad traffic indicate in part\r\nthe immense superiority of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThese statistics, however, prove that, if the earnings of commerce and\r\nnavigation were added, the annual value of the products of Massachusetts\r\n_per capita_ would be at least $300, and three times that of Maryland.\r\nIn estimating values _per capita_, we must find the earnings of commerce\r\nvery large, as a single merchant, in his counting house, engaged in an\r\nimmense trade, and employing only a few clerks, may earn as much as a\r\ngreat manufacturing corporation, employing hundreds of hands. Including\r\ncommerce, the value _per capita_ of the products and earnings of\r\nMassachusetts exceeds not only those of _any State in our Union_, BUT OF\r\nTHE WORLD; and would, at the same rate, make the value of its annual\r\nproducts three hundred millions of dollars; and of our own country,\r\nupward of nine billions of dollars per annum. Such, under great natural\r\ndisadvantages, is the grand result achieved in Massachusetts, by\r\neducation, science, industry, free schools, free soil, free speech,\r\n_free labor_, free press, and free government. The facts prove that\r\nfreedom is progress, that 'knowledge is power,' and that the best way to\r\nappreciate the value of property and augment wealth most rapidly, is to\r\ninvest a large portion of it in schools, high schools, academies,\r\ncolleges, universities, books, libraries, and the press, so as to make\r\nlabor more productive, because more skilled, educated, and better\r\ndirected. Massachusetts has achieved much in this respect; but when she\r\nshall have made high schools as free and universal as common schools,\r\nand the attendance on both compulsory, so as to qualify every voter for\r\ngoverning a State or nation, she will have made a still grander step in\r\nmaterial and intellectual progress, and the results would be still more\r\nastounding. She can thus still more clearly prove the fact, establish\r\nthe law, and give us the formula demonstrating that taxes for the\r\nincrease and diffusion of knowledge are the best investment for the\r\nincrease of national, state, and individual wealth. Then all would\r\nacknowledge the harmony of labor and capital, their ultimate association\r\nin profits for mutual benefit. This social as well as political union,\r\ntogether with the specializing and differentiation of pursuits, and\r\nobserving duties as rights, would falsify the gloomy dogma of Malthus,\r\nfounded on the doctrine of the eternal and ever-augmenting antagonism of\r\nwages and money, and solve, in favor of humanity, the great problem of\r\nthe grand and glorious destiny of the masses of mankind. The law of\r\nhumanity is progress, onward and upward, and will, in time, crush all\r\nopposing obstacles. If all--_all_ were fully educated, what miracles\r\nwould be accomplished, how great the increase of important inventions\r\nand discoveries, and how many new and sublime truths in science,\r\nsociology, and government would be developed! Would not the progress of\r\nthe State or nation approximate, then, a ratio depending on its numbers?\r\nIf all the States had contributed as much as Massachusetts to the\r\ntreasury and diffusion of knowledge, our whole country, North and South,\r\nwould have been advanced a century, and this rebellion, based upon the\r\nignorance, imperfect civilization, and semibarbarism produced by\r\nslavery, could never have occurred.\r\n\r\nBy table 35 of the census, p. 195, the whole value of all the property,\r\nreal and personal, of Massachusetts, in 1860, was $815,237,433, and of\r\nMaryland, $376,919,944. We have seen that the value of the products that\r\nyear in Massachusetts was $283,000,000 (exclusive of commerce), and of\r\nMaryland, $65,583,000. As a question, then, of profit on capital, that\r\nof Massachusetts was 34 per cent., and of Maryland 17 per cent. Such is\r\nthe progressive advance (two to one) of free as compared with slave\r\nlabor. The same law obtains in comparing all the free with all the slave\r\nStates. But the proof is still more complete. Thus, Delaware and\r\nMissouri (alone of all the slave States) were ahead of Maryland in this\r\nrate of profit, because both had comparatively fewer slaves; and all the\r\nother slave States, whose servile population was relatively larger than\r\nthat of Maryland, were below her in the rate of profit. The law extends\r\nto _counties_, those having comparatively fewest slaves increasing far\r\nmore rapidly in wealth and population. This, then, is the formula as to\r\nthe rate of profit on capital. First, the free States; next the States\r\nand counties of the same State having the fewest relative number of\r\nslaves. The census, then, is an evangel against slavery, and its tables\r\nare revelations proclaiming laws as divine as those written by the\r\nfinger of God at Mount Sinai on the tables of stone.\r\n\r\nFor seventy years we have had these census tables, announcing these\r\ngreat truths more and more clearly at each decade. They are the records\r\nof the nation's movement and condition, the decennial monuments marking\r\nher steps in the path of empire, the oracles of her destiny. They are\r\nprophecies, for each decade fulfils the predictions of its predecessor.\r\nThey announce laws, not made by man, but the irrevocable ordinances of\r\nthe Almighty. We cannot, with impunity, refuse to obey these laws. For\r\nevery violation, they enforce their own penalties. From these there is\r\nno escape in the present or the past, nor for the future, except in\r\nconformity to their demands. These laws condemn slavery; and the\r\npunishment for disobedience is recorded in the result of every census,\r\nand finally culminated in the rebellion. Slavery and freedom are\r\nantagonistic and discordant elements: the conflict between them is upon\r\nus; it admits of no neutrality or compromise, and one or the other\r\nsystem must perish.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that slavery is hostile to the progress of wealth and\r\npopulation: let us now ascertain its influence on moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nBy table 15 of the census of 1860, the result for that year was as\r\nfollows: In Massachusetts, value of books printed, $397,500; jobs,\r\n529,347; newspapers, $1,979,069; total, $2,905,916. Same year in\r\nMaryland, books printed, $58,000; jobs, $122,000; newspapers, $169,000;\r\ntotal, $350,155. By table 37, census of 1860, Massachusetts had 222\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, of which 112 were political, 31 religious,\r\n51 literary, miscellaneous, 28. Maryland had only 57, all political. The\r\nwhole number of copies issued in Massachusetts in 1860 was 102,000,760,\r\nand in Maryland, 20,721,472. Of periodicals, Massachusetts has monthly,\r\n1 political, 10 religious, 18 literary, 7 miscellaneous; quarterly,\r\nreligious 3, literary 2, miscellaneous 1, and 1 annual. Maryland had\r\n_none_. Not a religious, literary, scientific, or miscellaneous\r\nperiodical or journal in the State! What terrible truths are unfolded in\r\nthese statistics! None but a political party press in Maryland, all\r\ndevoted, in 1860, to the maintenance, extension, and perpetuity of\r\nslavery, which had 57 advocates, and not one for science, religion, or\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the circulation in 1860 of the press in Massachusetts\r\nexceeded that of Maryland by more than eighty-one millions of copies.\r\nThese facts all prove that slavery is hostile to knowledge and its\r\ndiffusion, to science, literature, and religion, to the press, and to\r\nfree government.\r\n\r\nFor schools, colleges, libraries, and churches, I must take the tables\r\nof the census of 1850, those of 1860 not being yet published. There were\r\nin 1850, in Massachusetts, 3,679 public schools, 4,443 teachers, 176,475\r\npupils; native adults who cannot read or write, 1,861. In Maryland, 907\r\npublic schools, 1,005 teachers, 33,254 pupils; native adults who cannot\r\nread or write, 38,426, excluding slaves, to teach whom is criminal.\r\n\r\nThus, then, slavery is hostile to schools, withholding instruction from\r\nthe children of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe number of public libraries in Massachusetts was 1,462, volumes\r\n684,015. In Maryland, 124, and 125,042 volumes. Value of churches in\r\nMassachusetts, $10,206,000. In Maryland, $3,947,884, of which $2,541,240\r\nis in Baltimore (which has very few slaves), and the remainder is mainly\r\nin the seven counties (from which slavery has nearly disappeared)\r\nadjoining Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAs to schools, colleges, books, libraries, churches, newspapers, and\r\nperiodicals, it thus appears that Massachusetts is greatly in advance of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nNow then, let us contrast loyal Maryland with rebel South Carolina, the\r\nauthor of secession, and assuming for many years to instruct the nation.\r\nBy the census of 1860, she had a population of 703,708, of whom 402,406\r\nwere slaves; and Maryland, numbering 687,049, had 87,189 slaves. Now, by\r\nthe census of 1860, South Carolina had 45 journals and periodicals, and\r\nher annual circulation was 3,654,840 copies. The circulation therefore\r\nof Massachusetts exceeded that of South Carolina more than ninety-eight\r\nmillions of copies, while Maryland exceeded South Carolina more than\r\nseventeen millions of copies. So much for South Carolina as a great\r\npolitical teacher. As to schools in 1850: South Carolina had 724 public\r\nschools, 739 teachers, 17,838 pupils. Massachusetts, then, had 158,637\r\nmore pupils at public schools than South Carolina, and Maryland 15,416\r\nmore pupils at public schools than South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe press of Massachusetts, we have seen, circulated in 1860 upward of\r\none hundred and two millions of copies, equal to 279,454 per day,\r\nincluding journals and periodicals, each read, on an average, by at\r\nleast two persons. This is independent of books and pamphlets, and of\r\nthe very large circulation of papers from other States and from Europe.\r\nWhat a flood of light is thus shed daily and hourly upon the people of\r\nMassachusetts! This intellectual effulgence radiates by day and night.\r\nIt is the sun in its meridian splendor, and the stars in an ever\r\nunclouded firmament. It has a centre and a circumference, but knows no\r\ndarkness. Ignorance vanishes before it; wealth follows in its train;\r\nlabor rejoices in its association, and finds its products more than\r\ndoubled; freedom hails its presence, and religion gives it a cordial\r\nwelcome; churches, schools, academies, colleges, and universities\r\nacknowledge its mighty influence. Science penetrates the secrets of\r\nnature, and unfolds each new discovery for the benefit of man. Coal, the\r\noffspring of the sun, develops its latent energy, and water contributes\r\nits untiring hydraulic power. Machinery takes more and more the place of\r\nnerves and muscles, cheapens clothing and subsistence and all the\r\nnecessaries of life, and opens new fields of industry, and more\r\nprofitable employment for labor. Steam and lightning become the slave of\r\nman. He performs the journey of a day in an hour, and converses in\r\nminutes around the globe. The strength of man may not have been much\r\nincreased, but his power is augmented a thousand-fold. His life may not\r\nhave been materially lengthened, but, in the march of knowledge, a year\r\nnow is as a century, compared with man's progress in the darkness of the\r\nmiddle ages. The eternal advance toward omniscience goes on, but is like\r\nthat of the infinite approach of the asymptote, which never reaches the\r\nhyperbolic curve. The onward march of science is in a geometrical ratio,\r\nso that in time, the intellectual progress of a day in the future, must\r\nexceed that of a century in the past. Knowledge is enthroned as a king,\r\nand grand truths and new ideas are his ministers. Science takes the\r\ndiameter of the earth's orbit as a base line and unit of measurement,\r\nand with it spans infinity, and triangulates the nebulous systems amid\r\nthe shadowy verges of receding space. Its researches are cosmical upon\r\nthe earth and the heavens, and all the elements minister to its\r\nprogress. Sink to the lowest mine, or fathom the ocean's depth, or climb\r\nthe loftiest mountains, or career through the heavens on silken wings,\r\nand it is there also. On--on--on; nearer--nearer--still nearer it moves\r\nforever and forever, with accelerated speed, toward the infinite\r\neternal. Such are the triumphs of knowledge; and he who diffuses it\r\namong our race, or discovers and disseminates new truths, advances man\r\nnearer to his Creator. He exalts the whole race; he elevates it in the\r\nscale of being, and raises it into higher and still higher spheres.\r\n\r\nIt is science that marks the speed of sound and light and lightning,\r\ncalculates the eclipses, catalogues the stars, maps the heavens, and\r\nfollows, for centuries of the past and the future, the comet's course.\r\nIt explores the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. With geology,\r\nit notes the earthquake, upheaval of mountains, and, with mineralogy,\r\nthe laws of crystallization. With chemistry, it analyzes, decomposes,\r\nand compounds the elements. If, like Canute, it cannot arrest the tidal\r\nwave, it is subjecting it to laws and formulas. Taking the sunbeam for\r\nits pencil, it pictures man's own image, and the scenery of the earth\r\nand the heavens. Has science any limits or horizon? Can it ever\r\npenetrate the soul of man, and reveal the mystery of his existence and\r\ndestiny? It is certainly exploring the facts of sociology, arranging\r\nand generalizing them, and deducing laws. It regards man in his social\r\nrelations, in families, tribes, and governments, savage, semi-barbarous,\r\nand civilized; beginning with the most simple, advancing to the chief,\r\nthe patriarch, the king, the feudal military, the regal aristocratic,\r\nthe pure democracy by popular assemblages, as in Athens and the school\r\ntowns of Massachusetts, rising higher to the central representative, and\r\nto the highest, although necessarily more complex, the federal\r\nconstitutional representative, carrying out the organic division, and\r\nthe subdivision of legislative and administrative action--regarding the\r\nstate, the national, and international policy, and, in the lapse of\r\ncenturies, the confederacy, fusion, and unification of nations. The\r\nconstitution of empires, with the legislative, judicial, and executive\r\nfunctions, furnish some of the elements of sociology. But we must take\r\nthe history of man, past, present, and future, note and arrange and\r\ngeneralize the facts, and thence deduce laws and formulas. Sociology is\r\nnot a mere accidental and disconnected series of facts, but it has laws,\r\nalthough far less known than those appertaining to the physical\r\nsciences. The work is commenced, and progresses here and in Europe. But,\r\nat this moment, at least in administrative action, Massachusetts is\r\nahead of all the world in the science of sociology.\r\n\r\nMan, elevated by knowledge in the scale of being, controls the forces of\r\nnature with greater power and grander results, and accumulates wealth\r\nmore rapidly. The educated free labor of Massachusetts, we have seen,\r\ntriples the products of toil, _per capita_, as compared with Maryland,\r\nand quintuples them (as the census shows) compared with South Carolina.\r\nOne day's labor of a man in Massachusetts is equal to three in Maryland,\r\nand five in South Carolina. So, if we take our savage tribes, with their\r\nhuts and tents, their rude agriculture, their furs, their few and simple\r\nhousehold manufactures, their hunting and fishing, the average product\r\nof their annual labor, at four cents a day each, would be $14.60 a year,\r\nor more than a fourth of that of South Carolina (56.91). So that\r\nMassachusetts, in material progress, is farther in advance of South\r\nCarolina than that State is of the savage Indians. Thus, we have the\r\nsuccessive steps and gradations of man: Massachusetts, with free labor\r\nand free schools, having reached the highest point of civilization;\r\nSouth Carolina, with slavery and ignorance (except the few), in a\r\nsemi-barbarous stage; and the lowest savage condition, called barbarous,\r\nbut nearer to South Carolina than that State to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSlavery, then, the census proves, is hostile to the progress of wealth\r\nand population, to science, literature, and education, to schools,\r\ncolleges, and universities, to books and libraries, to churches and\r\nreligion, to the press, and therefore to free government; hostile to the\r\npoor, keeping them in want and ignorance; hostile to labor, reducing it\r\nto servitude, and decreasing two thirds the value of its products;\r\nhostile to morals, repudiating among slaves the marital and parental\r\ncondition, classifying them by law as chattels, darkening the immortal\r\nsoul, and making it a crime to teach millions of human beings to read or\r\nwrite. And shall labor and education, literature and science, religion\r\nand the press, sustain an institution which is their deadly foe?\r\n\r\n_But slavery is the enemy of free government._ It has commenced and now\r\nwages an unholy war against this Union, and thus assails the liberty of\r\nour country and of mankind. It has framed a government based on the\r\neternity of chattel slavery, and demands in its name to rule the larger\r\nportion of the Union. It seeks to sever the lakes from the gulf, and the\r\nmighty Mississippi and its vast arterial tributary system. It asks to be\r\n_let alone_ in the commission of all these heaven-daring crimes. In the\r\nname of my bleeding country, of the millions whom it has doomed to\r\ndeath, or wounds, or chains, or misery; in the name of the widows and\r\norphans it has made, whose bitter tears and agonizing sighs now fill our\r\nland with sorrow; in the name of the free and blessed government it\r\nseeks to overthrow, and the glorious Union it strives to dissolve; in\r\nthe name of God and man, of religion and liberty, the world arraigns the\r\ncriminal at the bar of justice. Now is the day of trial: humanity hopes\r\nand fears, mankind await the verdict. It is rendered: _Guilty_ upon\r\nevery charge of the indictment; and heaven records the righteous\r\nsentence--_Slavery must die, that the Union and liberty may live\r\nforever!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING WE HAVE TO THINK OF, AND TO DO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's order for a draft--aside from its immediate purpose--has\r\nan important bearing in a more general view on the education of the\r\npublic mind. It is an impressive enforcement of the great principle that\r\nevery able-bodied man in the nation owes military service to his country\r\nas sacredly as he owes obedience to his God. This is a principle which\r\nprobably few persons will hesitate to admit when plainly confronted with\r\nit. But the conviction of it has slumbered in the mind of the people\r\nduring the long years of peace we have enjoyed. There has been almost\r\nnothing to remind us of it for fifty years past. The draft is an\r\nemphatic proclamation of it. It brings it home to the conscience of the\r\nnation; and thousands, who might otherwise have scarcely thought of it,\r\nwill be led to recognize and to feel it.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that we shall go further--that the quickened sense of\r\nobligation will make us consider what we must do to make the discharge\r\nof it of the greatest service to the nation; that we shall learn the\r\nlessons of wisdom which the present struggle enforces on us, and see to\r\nit, that in the future, by better military organization and instruction,\r\nthe able-bodied men of the country are rendered more capable of\r\neffective military service at a moment's call.\r\n\r\nOar military system, and the enrolment of the people under it, goes\r\nindeed upon this principle of the obligation of military service by\r\nevery able-bodied citizen--and so is a constant testimony to it; but in\r\npoint of fact it has done comparatively little toward cherishing the\r\nmilitary spirit, cultivating the military virtues, and securing an\r\neffective military force, ready at any moment for active service in the\r\nfield. Dreading nothing from foreign nations on this side of the ocean,\r\ncounting on the obvious policy of the nations of the old world to keep\r\nthe peace with us, and never dreaming of such a rebellion as has broken\r\nout in our midst--we have not only neglected but discountenanced the\r\ncultivation of the military spirit. Our men of education and high social\r\nposition, instead of contributing to make the militia system respectable\r\nby the personal performance of military duty, and by using all their\r\ninfluence to give a high tone to the service, have evaded its\r\nrequirements on themselves, and done all they could to sink it into\r\ndisregard and contempt: a dereliction of duty as unwise as wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is a miserable thing for a country to have to get ready for war when\r\nwar is forced upon it. This was the case when the rebellion broke out.\r\nWe were not ready for it. There was indeed no lack of men. Hundreds of\r\nthousands responded to their country's call; and the great body of the\r\npeople were carried away with the delusion that men with arms in their\r\nhands are soldiers, and that massing them in great numbers makes them a\r\ngreat army. Wise men--men of military judgment and experience--knew\r\nbetter. But the popular clamor for onward offensive operations\r\nprevailed; with disastrous result in the first instance. Not on the\r\nwhole perhaps to be regretted. It did what nothing else could have\r\ndone--it dispelled the popular delusion. It did something toward\r\nteaching the nation a lesson indispensably necessary to be learned--that\r\na million men with arms in their hands without discipline, are nothing\r\nbut an armed mob, and that the discipline which alone makes an effective\r\narmy, implies a great deal more than is gotten in company trainings and\r\nregimental parades under our old militia system.\r\n\r\nDiscipline--discipline--discipline; these are the first, second, and\r\nthird requisites to make men into soldiers. With it the poorest\r\nmaterials can be made effective. Napoleon made good soldiers of the\r\nItalian lazaroni--and a poorer material can scarcely well be conceived.\r\nIt is Napoleon that said: 'discipline is the first requisite for a\r\nsoldier--bravery is only secondary.' Indeed the more there is of bravery\r\nin an army composed of such men as the New England States and the rural\r\ndistricts of New York send to the war--'reasoning bayonets,' as Napoleon\r\ncalled them, bayonets in the hands of men with heads on their shoulders,\r\nand heads that have the habit of doing their own thinking--the more\r\nthere is of bravery in such a soldiery, the greater the need of\r\ndiscipline. Not only thorough training in the use of arms, but a habit\r\nof implicit obedience is indispensable to make good soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt this war is destined to make us a more military\r\npeople than we have been before. And good reason we should be. In the\r\nfirst place, because the prevalence of a higher military tone and the\r\nmaintenance of a more effective military force are indispensable for the\r\nnational security and defence. Until the millennium comes we shall\r\nalways be liable to foreign invasions or internal rebellion. In either\r\ncase there is nothing before us but to fight, and nothing but successful\r\nfighting can save us. But how can we fight successfully if we have only\r\nraw recruits or an ill-trained militia, and officers better skilled to\r\nhandle the yard stick than the sword, to marshal a column of figures\r\nthan a body of men? In the nest place, because the military\r\nvirtues--courage, fortitude, endurance, subordination, and obedience;\r\nthe military habits--promptitude, vigilance, order, attention to\r\ndetails; and the physical developments--health, strength, and heightened\r\nmuscular activity, which come from military discipline--all these are no\r\nless valuable as elements of the _morale_ or general character of a\r\nnation than indispensable in a merely military view, to a nation's\r\nsecurity and success in arms.\r\n\r\nTo form a disciplined army was the first thing we had to do when the\r\nrebellion broke out. It was a great pity, and a sad necessity to have to\r\nbegin to do it then. We have paid dearly for our folly and neglect. If\r\nwe had been as well prepared for war as the Swiss always are, it would\r\nhave saved us millions of treasure, and many score thousands of lives.\r\nLet us at least now not fail to learn the lesson of wisdom for our\r\nfuture guidance which the past forces upon us. Let us look out for\r\nhaving a good military organization--a permanent system that shall give\r\nus hereafter not the show only but the reality of an effective force;\r\nnot muster rolls of names of companies, regiments, brigades, but\r\nwell-disciplined citizen soldiers, with good officers able to handle and\r\nlead them. This is something that can be done--something that ought to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for consideration what is the military system that will\r\nbest keep us ready for war if war be forced upon us, and at the same\r\ntime with the least detriment or danger to the people or the Government.\r\nIs it a large regular force, a standing army, adequate to the defence of\r\nthe country always on foot and in the pay of the General Government? I\r\nthink not. The number of regular troops in the service of the Union\r\ndoubtless will and should be considerably increased. But to keep a large\r\nstanding army, as many of the great powers of Europe do, is what I hope\r\nwe shall never come to. I do not so much object to the great expense of\r\nit--for that is not worth consideration if it be the only or the best\r\nway to provide for the defence of the nation. But it is foreign to the\r\ngenius and spirit of our institutions, and involves dangers to our\r\nliberties. Human nature is human nature--and is pretty likely to\r\ncontinue to be. What history has recorded more than once, it may have to\r\nrecord again.\r\n\r\nShall we then adhere to our present militia system? Not, it is to be\r\nhoped, without very great modifications, additions, and improvements. If\r\nwe do, we shall show ourselves as incapable of learning by our own\r\nexperience as by the wisdom of history. At the same time, our militia\r\norganization furnishes the basis of a military system adapted to the\r\ngenius of our institutions, fully adequate to our national defence, and\r\none that will save us from the expense and dangers of a standing army\r\nlarge enough for the need of the country in a time of war.\r\n\r\nIn reorganizing our military system on this basis, I would go to\r\nSwitzerland for suggestions and guidance. The Swiss system, with certain\r\nchanges and with some features adopted from the English, is the one most\r\nfitted for our country. In Switzerland the motto is: 'No regular army,\r\nbut every citizen, a soldier.' This motto lies at the basis of their\r\nsystem. But then the system makes every citizen really a soldier. It is\r\na system that has shown itself adequate and admirably adapted for the\r\ndefence of the country against foreign foes and internal rebellion. Not\r\ntheir mountains merely, but their hearts and arms--and a knowledge on\r\nthe part of their neighbors what those hearts and arms were capable\r\nof--have preserved their independence. And as to internal safety, let\r\nany one read the story of the rebellion of 1847, when under Jesuit\r\ninfluence seven of the Swiss cantons formed a secession league\r\n(_Sonder-Bund_), and rose in arms. Immediately an army of more than one\r\nhundred thousand men from the loyal cantons was in the field, summoned\r\nfrom their ordinary callings, and in seventeen days the whole struggle\r\nwas over, despite the strong force and almost impregnable position of\r\nthe rebels, and despite the menaces of Austria and her offers of help to\r\nthe insurgents. In seventeen days their citadels were taken, the\r\ntraitors' league broken, and the loyal army (all but nine thousand men\r\nleft to see to the expulsion of the Jesuit conspirators and the\r\nrestoration of order) disbanded to seek their homes and renew their\r\nordinary occupations.\r\n\r\nI shall not pretend to go into the details of such a system as we should\r\nadopt, but confine myself to such observations as every man of general\r\nintelligence, moderately acquainted with military history, is competent\r\nto appreciate.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there can be no doubt of the importance of a good\r\nsystem for the enrolment of the rank and file, with effective provisions\r\nfor a certain amount of instruction and drill every year.\r\n\r\nThe next thing, and which is of still greater importance, is the\r\nadoption of a system that shall secure the formation of proper\r\nofficers. Dividing each State in the Union into a proper number of\r\nmilitary districts, there should be in every district a perfect\r\norganization of officers, staff, brigade, regimental, and line--what the\r\nFrench call _cadres_, the nucleus or skeleton of brigades and\r\nregiments--with special provision for their thorough and effective\r\ninstruction and discipline in all their respective duties. This was a\r\ngreat point in the policy of Napoleon. 'When a nation,' said he,\r\n'possesses neither _cadres_ nor the principles of military organization,\r\nit is extremely difficult to organize an army.' Attaching the rank and\r\nfile to these _cadres_--whenever and as often as there is need--they can\r\nsoon be made good soldiers, even if they have had but little training\r\nbefore; and there is no way in which discipline can be so speedily and\r\neffectively instilled. The _cadre_ is not only the frame, joint, or\r\narticulation, but the system of veins and arteries and nerves of an\r\narmy. All the military systems of Europe rest upon this principle. To\r\nprepare officers fit to be organized into these _cadres_, they have\r\nschools for special instruction--the school of the staff, and of every\r\nbranch of service--including everything relating to the subsistence and\r\nmovement of armies.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of a point of fundamental\r\nimportance. We have no such schools. We have nothing but West Point, and\r\nthat is nothing to the needs of the country. In every State there ought\r\nto be schools to prepare officers for the _cadres_--special schools for\r\nevery department of military science and art, either separately or\r\nunited in one comprehensive institution. The rebels have been wiser than\r\nwe of the North. For twenty years past, looking forward to this day, the\r\nconspirators and traitors now in arms for the overthrow of the\r\nGovernment, and the dismemberment of the nation, have been assiduously\r\ntraining officers. In nearly every Southern State they have had one, and\r\nin some States more than one special military school, founded and\r\nfostered by the State--beside introducing more or less of military drill\r\ninto their other schools, and in every way cultivating a military spirit\r\namong the people. And they have reaped the advantage of having at the\r\noutset of the contest a better supply of competent officers and\r\nmaterials for officers than we had.\r\n\r\nBut not only should there be such special military schools--one in every\r\nState, but there should also be institutions where a sufficient number\r\nof young men can get the preliminary education necessary to fit them to\r\nenter the schools of officers--an education which, beside being as\r\ncomplete and thorough a literary one as officers ought to have, should\r\nalso be such in point of military discipline and instruction as shall\r\nlay a good foundation for building themselves up and perfecting\r\nthemselves as officers by subsequent instruction and experience. It is\r\nnot absolutely necessary to establish institutions exclusively or\r\nspecially for this purpose. The end might be attained, if sufficient\r\namount of military instruction, drill, and discipline were added to the\r\npresent course of education in the schools, academies, and colleges of\r\nthe land. This perhaps would be the best way. It would accomplish the\r\nobject of preparing a sufficient number of young men to enter the State\r\nschools of officers, and would beside tend to diffuse throughout the\r\nbody of the educated class of the people something of military knowledge\r\nand of the spirit of the military virtues--to the great advantage of the\r\nnation in any times, but especially in critical emergencies demanding\r\ngreat and heroic sacrifices.\r\n\r\nSo horrible a thing is war, and so dreadful are its inevitable miseries,\r\nthat there is at first thought something shocking to many persons, in\r\nthe idea of making military instruction a part of the system of public\r\neducation--in cultivating the military spirit, and training the children\r\nand youth of a nation to science and skill in the arts of carnage. The\r\nkind and gentle-hearted find little consolation in being reminded that\r\nwar is one of God's agencies. They acknowledge that the earthquake, the\r\npestilence, the tornado, are His agencies. They find no difficulty in\r\nsaying, with WORDSWORTH, in regard to these:\r\n\r\n   'We bow our hearts before Thee, and we laud\r\n   And magnify Thy Name, Almighty God!'\r\n\r\nYet when he adds:\r\n\r\n   'But Thy most dreaded instrument\r\n   In working out a pure intent,\r\n   Is man arrayed for mutual slaughter--\r\n   Yea, Carnage is Thy daughter.'\r\n\r\nthey shrink from the thought and the image. It is too dreadful for ready\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to the subject, and a deeper view. See how the\r\nhero preacher, the saintly-hearted ROBERTSON--as pure and tender a\r\nspirit as ever breathed--puts the matter:\r\n\r\n     'Take away honor and imagination and poetry from war, and it\r\n     becomes carnage. Doubtless. And take away public spirit and\r\n     invisible principles from resistance to a tax, and Hampden becomes\r\n     a noisy demagogue. * * * * Carnage is terrible. Death, and human\r\n     features obliterated beneath the hoof of the war horse, and reeking\r\n     hospitals, and ruined commerce, and violated homes, and broken\r\n     hearts--they are all awful. But there is something worse than\r\n     death. Cowardice is worse. And the decay of enthusiasm and\r\n     manliness is worse. And it is worse than death--aye, worse than a\r\n     hundred thousand deaths--when a people has gravitated down into the\r\n     creed that the wealth of nations consists not in generous hearts,\r\n     in national virtues, and primitive simplicity, and heroic\r\n     endurance, and preference of duty to life--not in MEN, but in silk\r\n     and cotton, and something they call 'capital.' Peace is\r\n     blessed--peace arising out of charity. But peace springing out of\r\n     the calculations of selfishness is not blessed. If the price to be\r\n     paid for peace is this, that wealth accumulate and men decay,\r\n     better far, that every street in every town of our country should\r\n     run blood.'\r\n\r\nNow it may be that it is God's purpose to save us by the war we are now\r\nengaged in from such a 'gravitation'--to save us by war from calamities\r\nfar worse than any that war can bring upon us. But be this as it may,\r\none thing we must all admit, that horrible as war is, and dreadful as\r\nare its miseries, no nation is fit to be a nation that will not defend\r\nitself by arms, if war is forced upon it. And no nation is safe, or\r\nworthy of a place among nations, if it is not prepared to maintain its\r\nexistence against invasion from without or rebellion from within.\r\nBeside, to be prepared for war is one of the best securities against\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut the best, the only sufficient foundation for this preparation, must\r\nbe laid in _the education of the young_--an education not exclusively\r\nmilitary for any, but while professionally military for a sufficient\r\nnumber, yet as to the rest, military in just and due proportion--an\r\neducation which, as JOHN MILTON says, 'fits a man to perform justly,\r\nskilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices, both public and private,\r\nof peace and of war.' 'The nation,' says WORDSWORTH, in the preface to\r\none of his grand odes, 'the nation would err grievously, if she suffered\r\nthe abuse which other states have made of the military power, to prevent\r\nher from perceiving that no people ever was or can be independent, free,\r\nor secure, much less great in any sane application of the word, without\r\nmartial propensities and an assiduous cultivation of the military\r\nvirtues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOBLE DEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n   'Those great spirits, that went down like suns\r\n   And left upon the mountain-tops of death\r\n   A light that made them lovely.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE AND ITS COLLEGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love Cambridge, and must write very kindly about it. For in the first\r\nplace, I met there with some of the best men I have ever known. And\r\nsecondly, it has educated some very noted geniuses and fine poets. I do\r\nnot envy the American who can linger in its cloisters, ramble in the\r\ncollege walks and survey the colleges themselves with an unmoved spirit.\r\nOut of its courts marched Bacon, Newton, Milton, and Jeremy Taylor;\r\nWordsworth, Coleridge, and Byron issued from it but the other day, for\r\nwhat are a few years in the biography of genius? And was it not but\r\nyesterday that Tennyson wrote his prize poem there? It was hallowed\r\nground to me, worthy of not unmixed reverence, but of much reverence was\r\nit worthy.\r\n\r\nI went straightway to the residence of Dr. Whewell, master of Trinity\r\nCollege, and he received me very cordially. His works are well known in\r\nAmerica, and I knew them, and directly made complimentary allusions to\r\nthem, which, did not displease him. 'Sir, you are welcome,' he said,\r\npressing my hand. 'You are very welcome, sir.' He proceeded to talk of\r\nAmerica, and spoke of Edward Everett, and his visit to Cambridge in\r\n1842, and of the speech he made. Everett made a decidedly favorable\r\nimpression. 'We had a visit from another of your countrymen, last year,'\r\nsaid Dr. W. 'Parker of Boston--Theodore Parker. A man of genius, but I\r\nbelieve a rationalist in religion. He saw but few of our men, and,\r\nindeed, we were not disposed to receive him. It would have created a\r\nscandal. But he is a very clever man.' After tea, I repaired with the\r\nDoctor to his study, and had a pleasant chat with him about American\r\nliterature. We discussed the merits of Longfellow, Bryant, Irving,\r\nCooper, Channing, Bancroft and Emerson. Of the last-mentioned writer, he\r\nsaid, 'He is not like Carlyle, though the newspaper critics are\r\nconstantly associating them together. I have no sympathy with his\r\nopinions, but I am refreshed by reading him. He is a strong man, sir,\r\nand your country will be proud of him. Amongst our young men here his\r\nopinions are making great strides. 'Tis the vice of the age. Germany has\r\nhad the disease, and is near recovery. England and America have caught\r\nthe epidemic. But pantheism, sir, will not live, though here and at\r\nOxford the students are reading Hegel, Strauss, Bruno-Bauer, and\r\nFeuerbach. At Oxford,' he added, 'these pernicious doctrines are\r\ndemoralizing the university. Blanco White and John Sterling were but the\r\npioneers of a large party of university men, who are preparing to avow\r\ntheir disbelief in Christianity.' The Doctor was right. Francis Newman,\r\nbrother of the Puseyite Newman, who seceded to the Romish Church, and\r\nbelongs now to the Oratory of St. Philip Neri,--Froude, brother of the\r\ndeceased Puseyite Froude,--Foxton, an ordained priest of the Church of\r\nEngland, and Travers, another priest and vicar, have quitted Oxford and\r\nthe Church, and published heretical works, or are preaching heretical\r\ndoctrines; while, according to the testimony of Archdeacon Wilberforce,\r\nand Dr. Vaughan of Harrow, the doctrines of the German theologists have\r\nbeen embraced by half the undergraduates there.\r\n\r\nThe town of Cambridge is uninteresting. The streets are narrow and\r\ndismal, nor have they any ancient buildings or architectural oddities,\r\nexcept the Round Church, to arrest the stranger's attention, as\r\nShrewsbury and Chester have. The surrounding country is level as a\r\nprairie, broken only toward the southeast, by the ridiculous dustheaps\r\ncalled the Gog-Magog Hills. These hills belong to the curiosities of\r\nCambridge, and are as famous in university annals as the colleges\r\nthemselves. Robert Hale scarcely joked when he said to a friend who\r\nvisited him during his residence at Cambridge, and who asked him for\r\nthese hills, 'When that man yonder moves out of the way, you will see\r\nthem.' They are four miles from the town, and on the estate of the\r\nGodolphin family, of which the Rev. Sydney Godolphin Osborne, the S. G.\r\nO. of the London _Times_ newspaper, is the present representative.\r\n\r\nI was greatly disappointed with the Cam. It is a narrow, muddy stream,\r\nvarying in depth from five to twenty feet. There is a deep pool near the\r\nvillage of Grantchester, two miles from the town, in which Byron used to\r\nbathe, and which bears his name. I would have the stranger that visits\r\nCambridge go to see Grantchester churchyard. It is reached by a pleasant\r\nwalk across fields, and is really a beautiful spot. Many students who\r\nhave died at college are buried here. Another walk of three miles along\r\nthe old coach road, leading to Oxford, will bring him to the Madingley,\r\nwith its park and mansion, the seat of the Cotton family. Before he\r\nleaves this part of the country he should also visit Ely, distant twelve\r\nmiles, and see the venerable cathedral.\r\n\r\nThere are seventeen colleges and halls at Cambridge. The halls enjoy\r\nequal privileges with the colleges, which is not the case at Oxford. The\r\ncolleges are: Trinity, St. John's, King's, Queen's, Jesus, Corpus\r\nChristi, Caius (pronounced _Keys_), Sydney-Sussex, Magdalene (pronounced\r\n_Maudlen_), Christ's, Pembroke, Emmanuel, St. Peter's and Downing. The\r\nhalls are: Trinity, Catherine, and Clare. Bacon, Newton, Byron,\r\nTennyson, and Macaulay were of Trinity College; Milton was of Christ's,\r\nGray of Pembroke, Wordsworth of St. John's, and Coleridge of Jesus.\r\nThere is an amusing anecdote of Byron current in the university, which I\r\ndo not remember to have seen in print. The roof of the library of\r\nTrinity College is surmounted by three figures in stone, representing\r\nFaith, Hope, and Charity. These figures are accessible only from the\r\nwindow of a particular room in Neville's Court, which was occupied by\r\nByron during his residence at college. The adventurer after getting out\r\nof this window has to climb a perpendicular wall, sustaining himself by\r\na frail leaden spout. He has then to traverse the sloping roof of a long\r\nrange of buildings, by moving carefully on his hands and knees, at the\r\nimminent risk of being precipitated fifty feet into the court beneath.\r\nWhen the library is gained, a stone parapet has to be crossed, a bare\r\nglance at which sends a thrill through the spectator who surveys it from\r\nbelow. This feat Byron performed one Sunday morning, while the heads of\r\nthe dons and dignitaries were yet buried in their pillows, 'full of the\r\nfoolishest dreams.' He had abstracted three surplices from the college\r\nchapel, which he bore with him along the dangerous route I have\r\ndescribed. When the bell, at eight o'clock, rung out its deep-toned\r\nsummons to the usual morning devotions, and the fellows and\r\nundergraduates hurried on their way to the chapel, they were startled to\r\nbehold Faith, Hope, and Charity clad in surplices which reached in snowy\r\nfolds to their feet, while their heads were surmounted, helmet-wise,\r\nwith bedchamber waterewers. An inquiry was instituted by the indignant\r\ncollege authorities. A few select friends knew, and the rest of the\r\ncollege guessed, that Byron was the author of the outrage, but it was\r\nnever brought home to him. No undergraduate beholds these statues now\r\nwithout a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Cambridge, the poet's statue by Thorwaldsen had just been\r\nrescued from the cellar of the London custom house, where it had lain\r\nfor years amongst rubbish of all kinds, because the bigots of\r\nWestminster Abbey would not permit it to be erected in the Poet's Corner\r\nof that edifice. Dr. Whewell, much to his honor, though he is no\r\nadmirer of Byron's poetry, procured it for the library of the college,\r\nwhere the poet was educated.\r\n\r\nMany college anecdotes are related of Coleridge in Gilman's unfinished\r\nlife of him. (When will it be finished?) These, though they are not much\r\nknown in this country, I shall not repeat; but there is one current at\r\nCambridge which has never yet been published, from deference to the\r\nfeelings of the descendants of a vain, but otherwise worthy man.\r\nDr.----, the master of ---- College, it was known, aspired to a\r\nbishopric, but for a long time he had been disappointed, though he had\r\nassiduously paid court to the Tory ministry, and intimated, in various\r\nways, that he would have no objection to pronounce the _nolo\r\nepiscopari_. Was not Dr. Mansell, the master of Trinity, bishop of\r\nBristol? Watson, bishop of Llandaff, the apologist for the Bible, never\r\nstrove harder for the archbishopric of York than did Dr. ---- to get\r\nappointed bishop of any see that might fall vacant. It happened that the\r\nsee of Durham, the richest in all England, worth at that time, $400,000\r\na year, did fall vacant, and Coleridge, with borrowed money, posted up\r\nto London. In two days the master received a letter, offering him the\r\nbishopric--it was a private, friendly letter from the first Lord of the\r\nTreasury--on condition that he would support the ministry in more\r\nliberal measures than they had yet resorted to. He assembled his\r\nfriends, and communicated the happy tidings. The next mail conveyed to\r\nthe Prime Minister his grateful acceptance of the dignity. He was\r\nliberal at heart, and had always been so. His vote would be always at\r\nthe service of the minister and his party whether in or out of office.\r\nThe pleasing illusion was soon dissipated, and Dr. ----- never held up\r\nhis head again. Coleridge wrote the Prime Minister's private and\r\nfriendly letter.\r\n\r\nI gathered anecdotes of Bulwer, Macaulay, and Tennyson, that are perhaps\r\nnot worth the telling. Bulwer was of Trinity Hall. He went one day to\r\nbathe in the Cam at Grantchester, and was robbed of his clothes. Before\r\nhe could emerge from the water, the future dandy author of Pelham had to\r\nborrow a suit of corduroys from a rustic. He crept down by-lanes till he\r\nreached his rooms, but a friend met him, who teased him into an\r\nexplanation, and afterward spread the story. He was noted at Cambridge\r\nfor his foppishness, and for wearing scented kid gloves. Tennyson was\r\nmanly there, and gentlemanly, as he always is. I shall have something to\r\nsay about him hereafter.\r\n\r\nConnop Thirlwall, the present bishop of St. David's, one of the\r\ntranslators of Niebuhr's 'History of Rome,' and author of the best\r\nhistory of Greece that had appeared before the publication of Mr.\r\nGrote's magnificent work, used to say of the fellows of Trinity, when he\r\nwas tutor of that college, that they were the wittiest companions when\r\ndrunk, that he had ever met with. It is certain that, thirty years ago,\r\nthey used to drink to excess, and the Combination Room was the scene of\r\nnumerous debauches that would have discredited a common tavern.\r\nEverybody has heard of Professor Person's reputation in this way. He was\r\na famous compounder of whiskey toddy, and under its influence scattered\r\npuns and witticisms in the purest attic Greek. Since his day, the\r\ndrinking custom is abated, and even Dr. Thirlwall would find in the\r\npresent fellows of Trinity College a race of men altogether unlike those\r\nwho frequented the Combination Room, and called for their third bottle,\r\nin his time.\r\n\r\nI was at much pains to acquire correct information respecting the system\r\nof education pursued in the university. The son of poor parents, I\r\nfound, has but a small chance of receiving classical instruction in\r\nEngland. At Cambridge the sizars, and at Oxford the servitors, form the\r\nlowest grade of students. Formerly menial tasks were imposed upon them,\r\nand amongst other duties, they had to wait upon the fellows of their\r\ncolleges at the dinner table--to bear the dishes and fill the goblets.\r\nThis custom has long since been discontinued; nor are the sizars of\r\nTrinity and St. John's any longer distinguished from the great body of\r\nthe students by any external mark of inferiority. At the small colleges,\r\nhowever, they wear different gowns, and are recognized without\r\ndifficulty in the street. Of course, in aristocratic England they are\r\nshunned by the richer students. Their expenses for the first year of\r\ntheir college residence ought not to be over $300, and are frequently\r\nkept below $200 by the prudence of the individual. If, at the first\r\nannual examination of the college they obtain a place in either the\r\nfirst, second, or third classes, they are entitled to receive assistance\r\nfrom the college funds. So privileged, they pay no rent for their rooms,\r\nand their commons, or food, is furnished to them free of expense. They\r\nare, however, made to feel the humiliation of their position. They dine\r\noff the remnant dishes of the fellows' table, after the latter have\r\nrisen. There is certainly no lack of provisions, which are of a\r\nluxurious quality, and are cooked in the best style. The head cook of\r\nTrinity College receives a salary of $3,500 a year, and has about thirty\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nThe educational system pursued at Cambridge is open, I think, to one\r\nvery grave objection. Unless the student is tolerably wealthy, he is\r\ndeprived of the advantages which his richer companions enjoy. The brief\r\nlectures--of one hour's duration only--delivered daily by the college\r\ntutors to a crowd of undergraduates, are ill calculated to benefit the\r\nstriving individual student. As far as the college is concerned, the\r\nyouth is left to himself. If he cannot afford the expense of a private\r\ntutor, his attainments are due to solitary application, and he is self\r\ntaught within the very walls of a college. The private tutors reap a\r\nrich harvest from this careless system. They are usually members of the\r\nuniversity who have recently taken their first degree, and prefer the\r\nlarge recompense of tuition to the miserable stipend of a curacy. To\r\neach of their pupils--and a popular private tutor has usually eight or\r\nten--they devote one hour daily, and their charge is $70 for the term.\r\nAs a term sometimes expires at the end of seven weeks, they receive\r\nabout $2 an hour. This sum is beyond the poor scholar's means, and he\r\nhas to run an unequal race at the examinations with his more fortunate\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\nIf appearances are to be trusted, the Trinity undergraduates are not\r\nuntiring students. They seem to pass their days and nights in the\r\npursuit of pleasure. The great evil of the English universities is the\r\ncredit system, and though Dr. Whewell endeavored to show me that it was\r\nthoroughly discountenanced by the college authorities, he did not\r\nsucceed in convincing me that they were dealing properly with the\r\ndifficulty. A student, in defiance of all the restrictions imposed upon\r\nhis intercourse with the tradesmen of the town, may contract debts to\r\nalmost any amount. It is notorious that parents are brought to the verge\r\nof ruin every year by their sons' misconduct at college, unless they\r\nchoose to contest the demands of the tradesmen in a court of law, by\r\npleading the infancy of the debtor when he has not attained his\r\nmajority. The college regulations demand that every tradesman licensed\r\nby the university--and with none other is the student authorized to\r\ndeal--shall send to the tutor, at the expiration of each term, the bills\r\nof the respective undergraduates who have been his customers. From the\r\nposition occupied in society by the friends of the student, the tutor is\r\nenabled to judge whether he is exceeding his income. The expenditure\r\nwhich would be excessive for the son of a clergyman, with a small\r\nliving, would be moderate for the heir to a peerage. It is further\r\nrequired that the expenses of each term shall be paid before the\r\nundergraduate recommences his studies, and any tradesman who is known to\r\nwithhold from the tutor's knowledge any debt, or portion of a debt,\r\nowing him by any student, is immediately deprived of his license.\r\nNevertheless, all but a few of the more wealthy tradesmen conduct their\r\ntransactions with the students on the understanding that these\r\nregulations are to be violated at pleasure. Thus, from term to term,\r\ndebt is added to debt, until the student is preparing to leave the\r\nuniversity. Then the tradesman becomes eager for a settlement. The\r\nstudent endeavors to put him off with promises. The tradesman hurries to\r\na lawyer. A writ is issued, judgment is delivered, and the student has\r\nto fly from the university without taking his degree, in order to escape\r\na prison. Or, if he is in his minority, proceedings are commenced\r\nagainst his father, who, if he is a proud man, will rather pay the bill\r\nthan contest it, though the entire amount will seriously impair the\r\nfortunes of his other children. Or he may deny his liability, plead that\r\nhis son is a minor, and that the articles furnished were not\r\nnecessaries. In this way, it has been argued by barristers on the\r\nplaintiff's side that wine, cigars, jewels, and hired horses were\r\nnecessaries of life, and the presiding judge has sometimes ruled on one\r\nside that they were, and sometimes on the other, that they were not.\r\nHundreds of young men have had their prospects in life blasted by this\r\nsystem, and yet, no cure has been found. I heard of one instance, and it\r\nwas only one of many nearly similar, where an undergraduate had\r\ncontracted debts amounting to upward of $10,000 beyond his ability to\r\npay. Of this sum, I recollect some of the items: $1,000 was for cigars,\r\n$3,000 for wine, $2,500 for the hire of horses, $1,900 for rings, pins,\r\nand other trinkets, and only $200 for books. He had attained his\r\nmajority, and was sent to prison, his father resolutely refusing to pay\r\nhis debts. He languished in prison for two years, and died there.\r\n\r\nNor does it always follow that the undergraduate may be saved from this\r\ndisgrace and ruin by firmness and honorable principles. He is, for the\r\nfirst time in his life, his own master. The superintendence of the\r\ncollege tutor amounts to just nothing at all. Immediately he arrives at\r\nthe university, he is besieged by tradesmen. It is particularly\r\nimpressed upon him, that money is not necessary to conclude a bargain.\r\nHe can pay when he likes. Three years hence will do. The youth is sorely\r\ntempted. He finds his new college acquaintance sailing under press of\r\ncanvas, over the sea of extravagance. They give splendid wine parties,\r\nand invite him to the jovial board. He is bound to return the\r\nhospitality of these prime fellows. One extravagance leads to another.\r\nThe port and sherry, that he could afford, shine no more upon his table.\r\nHe drinks hock now, and claret, and princely champagne, at two dollars\r\nand fifty cents a bottle. He smokes cigars at $10 a pound. He is living\r\nlike a gentleman. Let the poor sizar toil over musty books; he will have\r\na race horse. 'Tis a fine life. How much better than a schoolboy's. He\r\nspeaks of his father as _the governor_, and talks in a flash manner of\r\nthe girls he is acquainted with. He thinks he will marry one of them,\r\nbut his choice is not determined. The college dons, professors, tutors,\r\nfellows, know the temptations, know the risk, know the ruinous goal, but\r\nno one arrests his career. Which is most to blame; the raw,\r\nundisciplined boy, or the evil university system?\r\n\r\nI passed a rare time at Cambridge. What delight it was in those cold\r\nmornings to take a bracing walk into the country, and looking back over\r\nmiles of level land, to behold the chapel of King's College, and the\r\ntower of St. Mary's church, which had been the land beacons of aspiring\r\nstudents for so many generations! I verily believe that the chapel of\r\nKing's College is the finest piece of modern architecture in the world.\r\nIt is a poem in stone! Teaching so much--not of this earth, only; least\r\nof this earth, perhaps. I never wearied of walking in it, and around it,\r\nrepeating Wordsworth's sonnet, and feeling that 'for a few white-robed\r\nscholars only,' it was not built; but as an utterance of man's spirit,\r\nmore fervent than he could express in the articulate speech of man. The\r\nsoul of the individual, nurtured by any semblance of culture, who can\r\nstand unmoved beneath that fretted roof, must be cold as the frozen\r\nzone. It remains with me, like Niagara.\r\n\r\nAs a college, Trinity is the most interesting. The chapel is very\r\ninferior to that of King's, but it is hallowed by the memory of Newton.\r\nRoubiliac's statue of the philosopher is the chief object of interest,\r\nand the Trinity men do not envy the scholars of King's their chapel,\r\nwhen they behold that statue. The dean of Trinity, the Rev. W. Carns,\r\nauthor of the 'Life of Simeon,' is the present possessor of the rooms\r\nonce occupied by Newton. The little watch tower where he pierced the\r\nheavens with his telescope is still standing. One ascends it, and\r\nsurveys the firmament, not without a reverential feeling. Cambridge\r\nabounds with the associations of genius. Chaucer studied here, and at\r\nOxford also, it is said; and in treading the great court of Trinity, one\r\ncannot help thinking of Bacon. Milton's mulberry tree is yet standing,\r\nand puts forth a few fresh leaves every spring in the garden of Christ's\r\nCollege. His manuscript of 'Comus,' partly in his own writing, partly in\r\nthat of his amanuensis--of one of his daughters, it is probable--is in\r\nthe library of Trinity College, and may be seen by the curious. The\r\nspirits of these venerable men still haunt the scenes of their studious\r\nyouth, and with their mighty shadows brooding over us, what is the value\r\nof dollars and dimes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHYSICIAN'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Phil, keep the office door shut and the windows open. None of your\r\nsacrilegious games of marbles on the front steps. Behave yourself\r\nrespectably, and wash bottles till I come back, or I'll turn you off\r\nto-morrow. Have an eye to Mrs. Thompson's gate, and if anybody _should_\r\ncall for me, you know where I am to be found, I suppose?\r\n\r\nPhil responded by a grinning nod, the question was superfluous. It is an\r\nattribute of boys of fourteen that they know everything they should\r\n_not_ know, and if there be one of the class who excels his fellows in\r\nuseless knowledge, my Phil is that lad. Apparently busied forever in\r\nthose light but continuous labors which pertain to an office boy, he\r\ncontrived to keep a far more watchful eye upon my movements than I was\r\nable to do upon his, and could tell (probably did) exactly in what\r\ndirection I usually bent my steps after the above formula, whether I\r\nwalked on the right or left hand side of the street, and how soon I\r\nreached my destination--the number of times my tender knuckles came in\r\ncontact with a certain hard green door, and the reception that awaited\r\nme inside it, the length of my stay--the only thing he had a legitimate\r\nright to know--and the mien, cheerful or dejected, according to the\r\nfortunes of the day, with which I returned to the empty office and full\r\nbottles, over which he was supposed to mount guard during my absence.\r\n\r\nPreferring not to notice the peculiarity of my assistant's manner, as it\r\nmight involve awkward explanations, I closed the door of his prison with\r\nan authoritative bang, that shook the slate outside it, and strode with\r\nhasty steps down the village street. There was no occasion for hurry,\r\nthe business I had on hand was not of a kind to demand it, and had been\r\npending a reasonable time; nor would any more haste on my part be lively\r\nto advance it much, but would rather verify the old proverb, of 'less\r\nspeed.' I therefore walked fast purely as a matter of principle, in the\r\nhope, that the village dames, who I knew were watching my progress from\r\nbehind the green paper curtains of their 'sittin' room' windows, might\r\npossibly judge from my speed, that I had been called to a patient at\r\nlast. Vain hope! idle precaution! every one of those astute matrons knew\r\nat least as well as myself the errand upon which I was bound, and far\r\nbetter than I, as I own in all humility, the state of health in the\r\nneighborhood, which precluded all possibility of any professional\r\nexertion on my part.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may remark, literally _en passant_, that the town in which I\r\nhad chosen to locate was salubrious to a painful and unnatural degree,\r\nthe very last place in the world for a young physician in ordinary\r\ncircumstances to seek his fortune, but my circumstances were\r\npeculiar--it was not so much fortune that I sought--in short, I had my\r\nreasons--and a large practice would have greatly interfered with my more\r\nserious occupation. Still, I do not deny that a slight modicum of\r\nprofessional business, just to fill up the intervening time and save\r\nappearances, would not have been amiss, and I had been in fact rather\r\nanxiously looking for some symptoms of the sort for a considerable time,\r\nwithout any result at all. The inhabitants all took Hall's 'Journal of\r\nHealth;' they cherished Buchan's 'Domestic Medicine,' they studied the\r\n'Handbook of Hygiene;' they were learned in the works of Fowler. Cold\r\nwater was cheap and plentiful, they used it externally and\r\ninternally--exercise was fashionable and inevitable, where every lady\r\nwas her own help, and every gentleman his own woodsawyer; food was just\r\ndear enough to make surfeits undesirable, and medicine was so unpopular\r\nthat nobody before me ever ventured to open a drug store; the old ladies\r\ndispensed a few herbs privately, and that was the end of it. People did\r\nnot seem to die; if anything was the matter with them, they\r\nperseveringly 'kept on,' till it stopped, the disease retiring in\r\ndespair from their determination to be well. Fat parties, who ought to\r\nhave been dropsical, were not so at all--they grew fatter, and\r\nflourished like green bay trees; lean persons, threatening to go off in\r\na decline, declining to do so, remained. Adventurous little boys,\r\nfalling from the tops of high trees to the stony ground, sustained no\r\ninjuries beyond the maternal chastisement and brandy-and-brown-paper of\r\nhome; babies defied croup and colic with the slender aid of 'Bateman's\r\nDrops,' and 'Syrup of Squills,' dispensed by a wise grandma, and\r\nchildren of mature years went through the popular infant disorders as\r\nthey went through their grammars, and with about as much result; mumps\r\nand measles, chills and chicken pox, prevailed and disappeared without\r\nmedical assistance, and though all the children in the village whooped\r\nlike wild Indians, no anxious parent ever thought it necessary to call\r\nin a physician. There was but one in the place before my advent, a\r\ncomfortable, elderly man, who selected the profession, as practised in\r\nhis native town, because it interfered less than any other with his\r\npunctual habits of sleeping and eating, and was a gentlemanly sinecure,\r\npossessing peculiar privileges. No patient of his ever dreamt of calling\r\nhim out at night, or keeping him away from his meals; the person to be\r\nill, chose a convenient hour between dinner and tea, and gave respectful\r\nnotice at a reasonable time beforehand. No extraordinary accidents,\r\nrequiring wonderful feats of surgery, were ever permitted in his\r\npractice; no stranger shocked his nerves by dying suddenly at the\r\nvillage hotel; no mysterious diseases, unknown of science, baffled his\r\nskill, or defied it; the locality was too far south for bronchitis and\r\nconsumption, too far north for poisonous malaria fevers and _coups de\r\nsoleil_; and being inland, just inside the line of the coast scourges of\r\ncholera and yellow Jack. In short, to quote the only epitaph in the\r\nvillage churchyard, 'Physicians was in vain.'\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning on which I took my way through this healthful\r\ntown--I mean, of course, professionally speaking, a very fine morning,\r\nindeed. The air was warm and damp, as if laden with pleurisy and ague;\r\nthe ground soft and oozy, seemed a sure thing for rheumatism and\r\ninfluenza. The sun unseasonably hot; fever and rush of blood to the\r\nhead. Old Captain Hopkins is constitutionally inclined to gout--he never\r\nhad a twinge through the rainy season, but it is just possible that\r\n_this_ may settle him. Mother Hawks is rheumatic, is she? if she is\r\nabout, disseminating scandal to-day, I shall be avenged for her\r\nslandering me; and the Sessions girls come out to get the news in all\r\nweather. That vicious child of Mrs. Thompson, after keeping me in\r\nsuspense four months, will probably 'croup up' to-night, and its\r\ngrandmother Banks is off on a visit, and Dr. Coachey never goes out\r\nafter dark, and I live right over the way! With these encouraging\r\nreflections, and a grateful glance upward, where a copper-colored sun\r\nblazed through a sea of purple mist, I pursued my way to the mansion of\r\nColonel Marston, father to Miss Dora Marston, to whom I am honorary\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nColonel Marston's house is situated on a fine grassy knoll, shaded by\r\nhandsome trees, and inclosed with a well kept hedge; it is just out of\r\nreach of village eyes and ears, but not beyond the pale of village\r\ncuriosity. Anybody there can tell you by what right I address good Mrs.\r\nMarston as my aunt, and pretty Dora as my cousin, while being not in the\r\nleast related to either. My dear mother, now deceased, when a young\r\nwidow, possessed of some property and a little boy, married Miss Dora's\r\nuncle, and became her aunt, thus making me, as I consider, virtually her\r\ncousin. At any rate, for twenty years I have been a frequent visitor at\r\nthe dear old house, recognized in my cousinly capacity by the family,\r\nand treated accordingly, and for more than half that time like a wolf in\r\nsheep's clothing, have I sought the avuncular mansion with an eye to\r\nMiss Dora, a fact she seems surprisingly unconscious of, considering how\r\nmany times, by hint and innuendo, by sigh and look, and tender courtesy,\r\nand honest speech, I have shown her the place she occupies in my mind,\r\nand given her, as it appears, the right to drive me out of it, if\r\npossible. Tom Hayes is her favorite instrument of torture. He is the\r\nyoung lawyer of the place, as I am the young doctor, and is advancing\r\nabout as fast in his profession. He is considered a good-looking fellow,\r\nthough I don't see it, and has undoubtedly a fine voice, upon which\r\npretext he spends about half his time twanging away upon Dora's guitar,\r\nand waking Col. Marston from his afternoon nap. It would look better, I\r\nmust say, for a young man in his position, to be at home, waiting for\r\npractice; but I have heard that he says the same of me, and perhaps with\r\nequal justice. At all events, it was hard to find his horse already tied\r\nto the gate post on that particular spring day, when warm and weary, I\r\narrived on the battle ground, prepared to put my fate to the touch at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the house lay the broad white public road, from which one\r\ndeviated to approach this earthly paradise; on the other, a narrower\r\nprivate one, a mere cart track, grass-grown, cool, and shady, leading\r\ndown to the mill stream that ran behind the grounds, brawling and\r\nseething and swelled by the spring rains into quite a respectable\r\ntorrent. Down this path Dora always took me to walk when she wanted me\r\nto say anything uncommonly foolish, which could serve her as food for\r\nlaughter, and down this path again we must always go when that villain\r\nHayes was of the party, and she wanted to play me off against him, or\r\nhim against me, or both against her womanly vanities. Accordingly I\r\nfound them equipped for a walk, loitering on the front piazza, not\r\nwaiting for me, however, as Dora took pains to explain, and as I could\r\nreadily believe, for they were flirting over a new song. Not in the best\r\nof humor, I took the offered seat near them, wiped my heated brows, and\r\nadvised my fair cousin not to saunter through the damp woodland paths on\r\nthis most unhealthy morning. 'I advise you as a physician, mind you,'\r\nsaid I, to give weight to the opinion which might be denied it in my\r\ncousinly capacity; but she received it with utter contempt and ridicule\r\nof my pretensions, gladly joined by Mr. Hayes, whose white teeth gleamed\r\nwolfishly behind a long black mustache, at my expense. We had shaken\r\nhands with great cordiality; I had inquired after his clients, he had\r\nprofessed interest in my patients; I had asked him how he had enjoyed\r\nthe ride with Miss Julia Stevens last evening, and he had just\r\nremembered seeing me, as he drove past Mrs. Hedge's in the front garden\r\nwith Anna Hedge; a reminiscence which went a thought too far, for I had\r\nbeen, at the time of which he spoke, seated on this very piazza beside\r\nthe innocent young lady opposite, who now showed no tokens of the sweet\r\nconfusion, with which she listened to my broken confidence last night,\r\nand only glanced from one to the other with guileless interest and\r\nwondering simplicity.\r\n\r\nNow I had said enough to her on that occasion to make me feel some\r\nanxiety concerning her demeanor to-day, and some resolution concerning\r\nmy own. I had a right to expect, after the way in which she then treated\r\nme, that if _my_ cheeks burned and my ears tingled, and my heart beat\r\nfaster, at the remembrance of that sweet meeting, hers would at least\r\nbetray some consciousness of the fact. But not a fleeting tremor shook\r\nher little hand, not a shade of color deepened the rose of her round\r\ncheek, not a passing emotion of bashfulness weighed down her curly\r\neyelashes. She was serenely self-possessed, superbly cool, and attentive\r\nto the obnoxious Hayes, in proportion as she was disregardful of me.\r\n\r\nBurning with suppressed indignation, I accepted her careless invitation,\r\nand followed the precious pair into the shrubbery, there being no other\r\nway of obtaining the explanation I was determined to have this morning.\r\nI had often seen such demonstrations before, and borne them with\r\ncomparative patience, knowing how well worth the trouble of winning, how\r\ntrue and tender after all, if only it could be reached under these\r\ndisguising caprices, was the wayward little heart that had tested my\r\nlove and tried my temper all these years. From her very cradle she\r\nprovoked me, from the frills of her baby cap she mocked me; and, grown\r\ninto the ranks of little girlhood, systematically aggravated me by\r\nartful preference of all the little boys I most hated, for whose infant\r\nattentions she unceremoniously deserted my elder claim and assured\r\nprotection. And yet, in all her childish troubles, from torn frocks to\r\nLatin lexicons, she flew to me for aid, counsel, sympathy, and\r\nprotection, repenting of all her sins against me, and walking in a\r\nstraight path again, till between her sweet eyes, and her pretty\r\nconfessions, her helpless reliance, and gentle ministering to my vanity,\r\nshe had regained a larger place than before in my alienated heart, and\r\ncould afford to play the very deuce with it again.\r\n\r\n'Twenty years of this sort of thing must have settled the question one\r\nway or another,' I argued; 'there is no use in my putting up any longer\r\nwith this bewitched town, and my empty slate, Phil's nonsense, and Tom\r\nHayes's impudence, my aunt's sermons, and my uncle's lectures, and Miss\r\nDora's caprices; she has either flirted with me, or she has loved me\r\nfrom her cradle.' I have sometimes thought the latter, but I greatly\r\nsuspect it is the former. Grand query, which is it? and I resolved to\r\nknow to-day.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain, however, that I tried during the shady walk to gain a\r\nmoment's conversation with Dora, a whisper in her ear, a look of her\r\neye, or a touch of her hand; such favors were reserved for the military\r\ncavalier who walked at her side, exultant and triumphantly good-natured,\r\nthough I seemed to read sneering and defiance in the very cock of his\r\nhat. Sullen and morose, as I saw her lifted over muddy places in his\r\nproud arms, or climbing a stile by his gallant assistance, I followed\r\nmore slowly, and completing this pleasant party behind me and before me,\r\nand about me, wherever he could get within stumbling reach, trotted my\r\nfavorite aversion, Rover, an ugly, awkward, senseless, and\r\nill-conditioned puppy, whom Dora had elected her prime pet and favorite,\r\nfor no better reason apparently than that we all hated him. The colonel\r\nkicked him, Mrs. Marston chased him, the cook scalded him, the boys\r\nstoned him, and I could hardly refrain from giving public utterance to\r\nthe anathemas that burned on my tongue, when the wretched animal, who\r\nseemed to have an insane attraction to me, floundered about my legs as I\r\nmoved, or flapped his stump tail under my chair when I sat still. Dora\r\nalone, with strange perversity, persisted in ignoring his bad habits,\r\nhis vulgar manners, his uselessness, his ugliness, and his impudence,\r\nand set me at defiance when I objected to him, by pressing him in her\r\nbeautiful arms--happy cur that he was!--and laying her soft cheek\r\nagainst his villainous bristles, till in very disgust and jealousy I\r\nceased to complain, and learned to submit quietly to his revolting\r\nfamiliarities.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion the few private kicks and pinches which I\r\nventured to bestow, availed nothing against his clinging affection, till\r\nwe drew near the water, and the sight of a rabbit's white tail further\r\nup the bank effected my release from his attentions, for he immediately\r\ngalloped in pursuit of it, and a similar happy accident left me for a\r\nmoment free to approach Dora without the intervention of my friend, Mr.\r\nHayes, who had gallantly volunteered to scramble up a steep bank for a\r\ncluster of pink flowers which Miss Dora persistently admired, as they\r\nwaved in inaccessible beauty above her head, though sister blossoms\r\nbloomed all about her feet. Being thus freed from the attendance of both\r\npuppies, as I suitably classed them in my mind, I approached the little\r\nqueen of my heart, who stood on the very verge of the wet sand, where\r\nshe had planted herself in express defiance of my professional warning,\r\nwith the water gently oozing up around her thin slippers.\r\n\r\n'Don't come here, cousin! I'm afraid you'll wet your feet!' she called\r\nout impertinently as I drew near; but her eyes were not lifted, and such\r\na rosy flush crept up her face as she said it, that I forgot my hot walk\r\nand hotter indignation, and glowed less with anger and more with love. I\r\nlaid my hand lightly on her shoulder, looking down on her mocking lips,\r\nand stooping, whispered something in her ear--in spite of female\r\ncoquetry (in her person), and her uneasy pretexts to escape, in spite of\r\nTommy Hayes, in spite of Rover, that marplot puppy, I had a moment's\r\nhearing, and used it manfully, and as I whispered, my heart beat thick\r\nwith triumph, for she could not raise her eyes to mine, they were\r\npensively watching the source of the rippling flood, and bright tears\r\nseemed quivering on the silken lashes, her cheeks wore a warmer scarlet,\r\nher pretty lips trembled with the fateful answer, and I was sure it\r\nwasn't no, and saw them pout, gracious heavens! to suit one of those\r\nshrill female screams which more than trump of war or voice of cannon\r\nstrike panic into the bold heart of man, and unnerve him to the finger\r\nends. 'My dog, my puppy!' she sobbed, 'he'll be drowned, he can't swim!\r\nHe's coming down stream, tail first, poor fellow! I knew it was Rover!\r\nOh why don't you go and save him?'\r\n\r\nThis passionate appeal was addressed to the sympathizing Hayes, I being\r\nin disgrace on account of an unfortunate ejaculation, wrung from me in\r\nthe first surprise, an impoliteness in strong contrast to the graceful\r\ngallantry of the hero of the cliff, who supported the weeping maiden in\r\nhis arms, and tenderly soothed her excitement, as the unhappy Rover\r\nwheeled and eddied toward us.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you go?' she reiterated impatiently, stamping her little\r\nfoot, and as her eyes this time wandered toward me, I responded by\r\nthrowing off my cap and coat, and preparing to obey; it was of no use to\r\nremonstrate or to explain to her that it was almost impossible to rescue\r\nthe dog, and that the attempt would involve great risk of my own\r\nlife--what did she care for that? The emotion I had so proudly\r\nmisinterpreted on her lovely face, was for a blundering senseless puppy;\r\nthe heart I had so faithfully served to win, was given to a miserable\r\ndandy: what remained to me, but to finish a life devoted to an unworthy\r\nobject, by consistently sacrificing it in the same worthless cause; and\r\nwith the bitter hope that my failures would end here, I prepared to\r\nplunge into the rushing water.\r\n\r\nI could not help looking back at Dora, who, tightly clinging to her\r\nlover's arm, had been hidden from me during my rapid preparations by his\r\ntall figure and ample white linen robes. 'Don't _you_ go,' she had said\r\nto him; 'let George go; if he can swear, he can swim--don't _you_ try,\r\nMr. Hayes!'\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes had no idea of trying; _he_ risk his life, a life so precious\r\nto a world of spinsters, for a miserable fellow puppy! he wash the dye\r\nfrom those perfumed whiskers--dear to the hearts of so many maidens--he\r\nruin those freshly laundered clothes, he abandon those new French boots!\r\nRidiculous! He glanced down into his companion's pale face with a smile\r\nof exquisite amusement, as she said it, but Dora's eyes were tightly\r\nshut, and she did not see him; so the sneer travelled to me, who was\r\nabout to drown in his stead for his lady's pleasure, and gave my heart\r\nits last dying pang as I quitted the shore.\r\n\r\nA cry of terror and recall, from what had been a dear voice, followed my\r\nsplashing descent into the deep water, and thrilled my nerves a moment;\r\nbut I struck out bravely for the whirlpool, where, plunging, yelping,\r\nstruggling, revolved the wretched beast, to whom my cousin had resolved\r\nto sacrifice my life, and for whose sake she was crying on the beach.\r\nMuch time was lost in reaching, more in capturing the blundering fool,\r\nwho, mad with fear and fright, dreaded me more than the water, and when\r\nI had him in my arms at last, we were rapidly shooting toward the cruel\r\nwheel that splashed and creaked a hundred rods below, ready to suck us\r\nin to certain death. Well, what would it matter? Dora would be sorry\r\nperhaps, at least for the dog, and so desperately bitter and vengeful\r\nwas I that I was glad her clumsy pet, since she loved him so much, was\r\nto drown in my company, that she too might feel what it was to mourn the\r\nloss of something dearly loved, and that my death would be associated in\r\nher mind with a painful event--in short, I despised the weakness and\r\nfelt my mad folly, but it _would_ have its way. I closed my eyes upon\r\nthe shifting scene, and tried to prepare for death, unconscious that the\r\ncurrent was bearing me close to the shore, and that my only chance of\r\nescape was near. Something struck my face, a thrilling voice called my\r\nname, I raised my heavy gaze, and there, clinging to the farthest\r\nbranches of an old tree that had fallen over into the water, and\r\nstretching out her arms to me, was Dora, her cheeks wet, her lips pale,\r\nher eyes imploringly fixed on me, or on the burden I carried, regardless\r\nof the rushing flood that saturated her floating dress and tiny feet,\r\nand threatened to bear her away from the frail support to which she\r\nclung. Feeble, exhausted, despairing, as I was, there was a magnetic\r\npower in that dear voice, in that beautiful pale face, that inspired me\r\nwith hope, and drew me back to life.\r\n\r\nA few strokes impelled me nearer, the stream drifted me among the\r\nsweeping branches, I was clasped in those beautiful arms, then seized\r\nand dragged along by a stronger gripe, and presently lay half senseless\r\nand wholly exhausted on the sandy beach.\r\n\r\nI was content to lie there while I fancied I felt soft hands press mine,\r\nwarm tears baptize my face, and gentle touches extricate the gasping\r\nRover from my drowning gripe on his hair; but after he was removed, I\r\nseemed to be more roughly handled by less tender fingers, and opened my\r\neyes to find the zealous Mr. Hayes kneeling by my side, and, under his\r\nfair mistress's orders of course, doing his duty toward my\r\nresuscitation, while at a safe distance stood Dora, her dripping\r\nfavorite sneezing and floundering in her arms, and her happy face\r\nbeaming rosier and fairer than ever, by contrast with her soiled and\r\nbedraggled garments, as she pressed the precious rescued treasure to her\r\nheart, and received her lover's congratulations on its restoration, with\r\nonly an occasional furtive glance at me, as I lay slowly coming back to\r\nlife under his active treatment.\r\n\r\nSo the tears, the pallor, the heroism, the daring rescue, were for the\r\nsake of that worthless dog. I was saved incidentally with her\r\ninteresting favorite, as I might have drowned in his cause, and no\r\nquestions asked, and having accomplished my high mission, and preserved\r\nthe stupid brute, lay untended and uncared-for on the sand, dependent on\r\nthe kind offices of my successful rival! The blood rushed back to my\r\nheart, the fiery strength to my nerves, as I slowly drank in the\r\nbitterness of this cup.\r\n\r\n'Your cousin's better, Miss Dora,' said the benignant Hayes. 'Aren't you\r\ngoing to thank him?'\r\n\r\nShe moved nearer in instinctive obedience to him, bashful, tearful,\r\ntrembling, confused, but radiant and lovely as I had never seen her, and\r\nlifting her timid eyes to his, as it seemed for further instructions,\r\nwith a gentle deprecating grace, while she carefully averted them from\r\nme. I could bear it no longer, and with an energetic oath sprang up,\r\nknocking the astonished Tom back into my place, and extorting a little\r\ncry of surprise from Miss Dora, as I strode away toward the village,\r\ndetermined to shake its dust from my feet, and never again look upon the\r\nfaces of the precious couple I had left. I rushed through my aunt's\r\nkitchen like a whirlwind, on my way, and bade her good-by.\r\n\r\n'Good-by, Georgy? what does the boy mean?' said she. She was phlegmatic\r\nand slow.\r\n\r\n'I mean I shall never see you again, aunty. God bless you, I'm going\r\naway.'\r\n\r\n'Hoity-toity, nonsense!' said she; 'some folly of yours and Dora's;\r\nnever mind her, a silly girl! you'll be my own boy yet, my dear; but\r\nyou're dripping wet, George; you have been in the water, you'll take\r\ncold, child; here swallow this,' and mingling spirituous with spiritual\r\ncomfort, the good old lady poured a fiery glass of brandy down my\r\nthroat, and I poured out my sorrowful story into her motherly ear, as I\r\nhad done when an orphan boy, and all my life since, waxing warm with\r\nanger and contempt as I told it, while her benignant face showed no\r\nsymptom of the indignation that glowed in mine; she pitied and soothed\r\nme, but made no comment.\r\n\r\n'So good-by, aunty,' said I, as I finished, in a tone tremulous with\r\nweakness and wrath; '_you_ love me, if Dora does not, and _you_ will\r\nremember me kindly I know.' I wrung her hand and kissed her cheek, but\r\nshe never shed a tear; she had been wont to weep like a watering pot\r\nwhen I went back to school or college after a visit, and I had always\r\nleft her, loaded with biscuits and blessings, thankless prodigal that I\r\nwas! and disposed to laugh at her display of maternal sorrow. How\r\ngrateful to my wounded and sorrowful spirit, my outraged heart, would\r\nsuch a demonstration of love now have been! but all were alike heartless\r\nand cold to-day, and she smiled serenely under my parting kiss, and\r\nsaid, as I ran down the steps, 'Promise me not to go before you are well\r\nrested in the morning, Georgy; the coach does not pass through till\r\neleven, and you'll come back, if I have occasion to send for you--before\r\nthen--professionally?'\r\n\r\nI bowed assent; what could I do? and, cut to the heart, went slowly and\r\nwearily home. I do not know how or by which way I arrived there, or whom\r\nor what I passed upon the road; I saw nothing but the darkness of my\r\nfortune, and felt nothing but the terrible sorrow that consumed my\r\nheart. Phil was astonished at the gentleness of the reproof he received\r\nfor being discovered with a crowd of young vagabonds playing pitch-penny\r\nin my very office; but I was too broken in spirit to administer justice\r\non him--how could I expect him to be true when all others were\r\nfaithless?--and quite subdued and conscience-stricken he waited upon me\r\nassiduously, till my last bottle was packed at midnight and I sent him\r\nto bed, with orders to call me at sunrise. The stage came through at\r\neleven, and I usually rose at nine; but I scorned to comply with my\r\naunt's injunction, to take my ordinary rest, and was bent upon the\r\nadditional misery of rising early in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhat weary, dreary hours! I heard every one of them strike, as I lay\r\ntossing on the patent spring mattress, in that darkly shaded and\r\nsacredly secluded room, where I was wont to sleep the sleep of the\r\nsluggard, until I saw the day break, for the first time in my life, I\r\nthink, and the novelty put me to sleep, and thence into a dismal dream,\r\nfrom which I was awakened by a tremendous thumping at the office-door,\r\nand the shrill voice of my Phil, in communication with the person\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n'I shan't open the door for nobody,' that faithful janitor was\r\nannouncing, 'and if you don't stop knockin' on it, I'll come out and\r\nmake ye. He's asleep, I tell yer; goin' away to-day, and wants to get up\r\nin time for the stage, but I shall let him oversleep hisself, and he'll\r\nthink better of it by to-morrow. Come this afternoon if you want to see\r\nhim; that'll do for _you_.'\r\n\r\n'But I tell you it _won't_ do,' returned a gruff voice, which I\r\nrecognized as that of Colonel Marston's hired man. 'Miss Dora's sick\r\nwith pleurisy, she catched her death of cold yesterday, fishin' her\r\npuppy out of the river. Dr. George was in it, too, and you'd better let\r\nme in, for he'll be ravin' when he knows she is out of her head with a\r\nfever this mornin', and Mrs. Marston sent me herself, and told me to\r\nbring him back, and no excuse.'\r\n\r\nI sprang out of bed, and was down stairs questioning the messenger\r\nbefore Phil could invent any more excuses for keeping him out. Dora sick\r\nof a fever, and I called in? my pride rebelled at entering the house\r\nagain, after the treatment I had received from its inmates; but I had\r\npromised Mrs. Marston to return whenever 'sent for professionally,' and\r\nmy promise was sacred; the other doctor was worse than useless, and if\r\nDora should be dangerously ill--lovely, brave Dora, who perilled her\r\nlife for mine yesterday--for mine and the dog's-but never mind that now,\r\nshe was heartless, but could I find it in my heart to turn away from her\r\nin her sorrow? Alas! I was still so weak, that my love drew me more than\r\nmy pledged word, along the well-known road that yesterday I had vowed\r\nnever to tread again.\r\n\r\nMy aunt met me at the door. I was breathless and agitated, but she\r\nseemed more cheerful than I had expected; her eyes were full of tears,\r\nfor she had just come from the sick room, but there was a smile on her\r\nkind face as it looked pleasantly into mine. 'Is she very ill?' I\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\n'Not very,' she said, coolly; 'come here a moment, Georgy,' and taking\r\nmy hand, she drew me into her own little sitting-room, and shut the\r\ndoor. 'My dear boy,' she continued, placing both her soft hands on my\r\nshoulders, 'I sent you rather an urgent message, for fear you wouldn't\r\ncome back in spite of your promise, and I want this settled about you\r\nand Dora; you have tormented each other long enough, you with your\r\nexactions and jealousy, she with her flirting and all that; I don't say\r\nshe was not the worst of the two, but that's over. No, she's not very\r\nsick--don't interrupt me! She caught cold yesterday, as I thought she\r\nwould, in that foolish, wicked business you were all engaged in,\r\ntempting of Providence I call it, but I hope it will do you good, and\r\nlearn you a lesson. What, Georgy! you expected a wild, shy young girl to\r\nshow you her heart without asking? you expected a spoiled, flattered\r\nchild, whom you have done the most to spoil and flatter, not to tease\r\nand torment you when she had it in her power, and could you not bear it\r\nbetter from your little wayward favorite, who, you know, was always\r\ntrue-hearted after all? Pshaw, my dear boy, I needn't plead for our dear\r\nbaby. Poor Dora has a sore heart, for she thinks you have gone away in\r\nanger forever, and her sins against you are all badly punished already.\r\nI think you'll forgive her, and I won't tell you if it's worth your\r\nwhile. She looks dreadfully, and feels badly, and as she has hardly been\r\nsick a day in her life, thinks she is going to die, or she never would\r\nhave told me what she did tell me. I'm her mother, it's not for me to\r\nbetray her; but you're my son, too, and I wish you both happy. Go in now\r\nand forgive your old aunty's long speeches; do what you can for my poor\r\nlittle girl, and don't ever give me reason to repent putting so much\r\npower into your hands. Georgy, my dear, bless you.'\r\n\r\nShe gave me an affectionate kiss, under more excitement than I had ever\r\nseen her, and fluttered into an inner room, just as the stage rolled by\r\nthe door; to be saluted by a burst of sobs, and a strange muffled voice\r\nasking, hardly intelligibly, 'Wasn't that the coach, mother?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear.'\r\n\r\n'Then he's gone, mother; George is gone, and he'll never come back--do\r\nyou think he ever will? I treated him so badly; I have been so hateful\r\nto him you don't know, even when he nearly drowned saving Rover's life.'\r\n\r\n'Poor Rover! he wants to come in and see you.'\r\n\r\n'Don't let him in, don't you, mother; I hate the sight of him, ugly,\r\nawkward fellow! he nearly drowned poor George, yesterday, and I never\r\ncan bear to see him again now George is gone; beside, I believe I only\r\nloved Rover to plague poor George. Oh! oh, I feel so dreadfully, mother;\r\ndo you think I'm going to die?'\r\n\r\n'Not just yet, my dear. Shall I send for the doctor?'\r\n\r\n'No, ma'am, I don't want any doctor. I had as lief die as not, I'm so\r\nmiserable; beside, if I hadn't, Dr. Coachey would kill me, poking and\r\npreaching over me. Oh, if George was only here!'\r\n\r\n'George _is_ here, Dora.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, is he really?' and she cried harder than ever. 'Well, I can't see\r\nhim, mother;' after a pause: 'Does he want to see me?'\r\n\r\n'No, I sent for him professionally. I can tell him to go away.'\r\n\r\n'No, wait a minute, mother; do I look so _very_ badly? Please make the\r\nroom darker; oh, I don't want to see him at all! I'm ashamed to see him,\r\nbut I will. I must beg his pardon for all my wickedness, before I get\r\nworse, or he poisons me with his dreadful drugs; he hasn't had a patient\r\nyet, and he'll be glad of the chance to practise on me, I know; he will\r\ndose me with everything. And, mother, if George is coming in, please\r\nturn in Rover.'\r\n\r\nQuietly laughing, my aunt came out and ushered me with due ceremony\r\nbeyond the door, and shut it after her. In a darkened chamber, dim and\r\ndismal, before a lowly, slowly smouldering fire, in a great stuffed\r\nchair of state, sat poor little Dora, swathed in blankets, and muffled\r\nin shawls. Her tiny feet were wrapped in a woollen bundle, and rested on\r\nhot bricks, and her aching head was tied up in red flannel bandages that\r\nsmelled of brandy; she had a mustard plaster on her chest, a cayenne\r\npepper 'gargle' for her throat, and a cup of hot ginger tea stood at her\r\nelbow; her pretty nose was swollen out of shape, her bright eyes were\r\nred and inflamed, and little blisters had broken out all over those\r\nkissable lips; a very damp white handkerchief lay in her lap, and two\r\ngreat tears, that it had not yet wiped away, ran down her flushed\r\ncheeks. Poor child! she put up both her small hands when I came in, to\r\nhide her little red face; but I could see the 'salt pearls' that rolled\r\nbetween her slender fingers, and melted my heart at once. Sorry and\r\nashamed, and afraid to speak, but more hopeful and happy than I had\r\noften felt, I went quietly, and stood behind her chair.\r\n\r\n'George!' she said presently, in her poor little broken voice. 'Are you\r\nthere?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Dora.'\r\n\r\n'Are you very angry with me?'\r\n\r\nI put one of my hands down over the chair-back, and drew both hers away\r\nfrom before her face, and then came round and kissed it; I could not\r\nthink of anything better to do.\r\n\r\n'Yon are not going away?'\r\n\r\nI shook my head. 'That is not for me to say.'\r\n\r\n'Who then? Will you please tell me what you mean, George?' She was very\r\ngentle and submissive, but the coaxing voice trembled painfully, and the\r\nburning hand I touched began to grow cold.\r\n\r\n'It is for you to say, Dora, dear! Did you need to ask me that, after\r\nall these years?'\r\n\r\nWithout a single word, but with a fond impulsive movement, that answered\r\nquite well instead, she turned to me, and putting both her little arms\r\naround my neck, laid her feverish cheek against mine, and cried, as if\r\nher heart were breaking.\r\n\r\n'My dearest! what is the matter?'\r\n\r\n'I thought you were angry with me, and had gone for good; I though I had\r\nworn your patience out at last, and you would never forgive me or come\r\nback again. Why did you come back, Georgy?'\r\n\r\n'Because I loved you, Dora, and couldn't stay away.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you would, if I had not been sick--mother told me so. I had\r\ntreated you too shamefully, and wounded you too cruelly; but it hurt me,\r\ntoo, and I deserved to have you not forgive me for all I must have made\r\nyou suffer. You were proud, but you were very patient, Georgy; how long\r\nhave I plagued you?'\r\n\r\n'Twenty years!'\r\n\r\n'Then I have loved you twenty years, and tried not to let you know it. I\r\nwas very proud, very wicked, very mean, but I am sorry now. I was\r\nashamed to have you or anybody see how much I liked you; but now I don't\r\ncare, I'll tell the truth before I die. I am glad I am sick, George; for\r\nif I don't get well, you will remember what I said, and will have\r\nthought better of me; and if I live--'\r\n\r\n'My dear Dora, you are to marry me in three weeks, so don't let us talk\r\nabout dying; you have a little cold, that is all, and I'll give you time\r\nto get over it, and recover your voice, and get those ugly blisters off\r\nyour face.'\r\n\r\n'Is it _very_ ugly?' she whispered, hiding it against my shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Very ugly, indeed, and I hope it will stay so, till we are married;\r\nthen we shall have no more flirting with Tom Hayes; I would like to\r\nhave murdered him yesterday, when--when you wanted me to drown, and not\r\nhim, Dora.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, George! I didn't know the dreadful danger till it was too late, and\r\nyou were gone. I knew you were brave, and could swim, and he wasn't or\r\ncouldn't; I thought you would do it easily, and never dreamed you could\r\nbe drowned, till you were in the water, and he told me, and then--'\r\n\r\n'And then my little heroine risked her life to save me.'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't have cared to live without!'\r\n\r\n'And cried over me when I was landed?'\r\n\r\n'I was so glad and thankful, dear George.'\r\n\r\n'But was ashamed to let Tom Hayes see it afterward.'\r\n\r\n'No, only ashamed to speak to you, because I had behaved so badly;\r\nafraid you would order me away from your sight forever, as soon as you\r\nwere able. I am bad, I know; but indeed, indeed I am not so bad as you\r\nthink me!'\r\n\r\nAh! how easy it was to believe it, with that sweetly humble voice\r\nwhispering in my ear; those pleading eyes truthfully looking into mine;\r\nthe new charm of her timid, deprecating manner, going straight to my\r\nunfortunate, yielding heart, and conquering at once all the territory\r\nthat had not succumbed to her earlier graces, when in health and\r\nspirits. Yet I had seen something of this 'death-bed repentance' before,\r\nand I should have preferred to marry her at once, while the swelled nose\r\nand the weakened eyes disabled her from coquetry, rather than to use my\r\nhumble skill to restore her to health and beauty, and the society of Mr.\r\nHayes--rewarded by having my marriage indefinitely postponed, and my\r\npromised bride infinitely tormenting me. A physician is accustomed to\r\nsee promises, made in sickness, unperformed in health, and the debt of\r\ngratitude, or otherwise, to the medical attendant left unacknowledged\r\nand unpaid: he is obliged to calculate the chances of his fees pretty\r\nclosely, you see. These thoughts I was weakly about to reveal to Dora,\r\nwhen a tumbling and snorting at the door announced Rover, and happily\r\nprevented me.\r\n\r\n'Shall I let him in?' I politely inquired of the invalid.\r\n\r\n'Just as you please, dear,' she gently answered; 'if he is so\r\ndisagreeable to you, perhaps I had better give him away,' she added\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\nHeavens! what a change! I was completely subdued by that last convincing\r\nproof of affection; though as to giving him away, what mortal in his\r\nsenses would take him? Of course he remained, to become a member of my\r\nfamily, growing _dearer_ to us both as he broke uncounted crockery,\r\ninvolved us in innumerable quarrels with our neighbors, and fattened\r\nupon meat at ten cents a pound, like the favorite of a Chinese epicure.\r\nAt the very altar, or rather, I should say, the piano, before which we\r\nstood to be married, he interfered with the happy arrangement of the\r\nbridal party, with his ill-timed blandishments; but afterward did rue\r\ngood service by getting under the feet of my groomsman, Mr. Hayes, and\r\nendangering his equilibrium as he was about to salute the bride.\r\n\r\n'Poor Hayes!' I said, pityingly alluding to this failure afterward with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'Oh you needn't pity him,' she answered spitefully, but fortunately\r\nproving that the offence which produced the spite was not mine, by\r\nstanding on tiptoe to kiss me; 'he'll be married to Julia Stevens before\r\nthe month is out.' And so he was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome time has elapsed since the occurrence I have here narrated, gave me\r\nmy first patient, and decided me to remain in this neighborhood, with or\r\nwithout others; it is fortunate I did so, for the spell is broken that\r\nheld us in supernatural health, and no invalid reader of the\r\nCONTINENTAL need address me for the proper name of the locality, with a\r\nview of removing to its salubrious air. My practice is increasing\r\nrapidly, in spite of Mrs. Thompson's baby, which has hitherto\r\ndisappointed my expectations of croup, but promises in time a beautiful\r\ncase of hereditary asthma. Captain Hopkins is on his last legs with the\r\ngout, unless he soon resolves to spend part of his income in improving\r\nmine; and nine of the Sessions girls have had the scarlet fever.\r\nRheumatism begins to rage among the old ladies, and 'neurology' is\r\ngreatly in vogue among the young ones; the late fine fruit season has\r\nproduced much cholera infantum among the juvenile population, with a\r\nspecial tendency to cramps in the cases of the little boys; and the\r\nrecent fall in the prices of provisions has induced a similar decline in\r\nhealth with certain of the rural economists. A railroad is projected\r\nthrough our midst, which will bring foreign diseases and habits among\r\nus, and turn our peaceful Arcadia into a miniature New York. I see, in\r\nimagination, a busy and prosperous future in store for me; I see my\r\nhandsome and hitherto unused sets of surgical instruments often taken\r\nfrom their case, for 'disasters,' 'collisions,' 'smashes,' and 'shocking\r\naccidents.' I see fashion reigning in our humble streets, with her\r\nneuralgic little bonnets, her consumptive thin shoes, her\r\nlung-compressing corsets, and fever-tempting bodices, her unseasonable\r\nhours, and unreasonable excitements and unnatural quantities and\r\nqualities of food and drink; I see my little stock of drugs increased to\r\na mighty establishment; my Phil, of some use at last, dispensing them\r\nrapidly, and Rover, hoarse with barking at the ringing of the night\r\nbell. I see Dr. Coachey retiring in despair to his whist and his\r\nsangaree, and myself sole autocrat of the village health; and brightest\r\nof all these bright visions, I see my pretty Dora, the beautiful spirit\r\nof all light and love in my household, infinitely lovelier and more\r\ncharming than even in her girlish days, but without the faintest symptom\r\nof the coquetry that marked her then--blind to all fascinations but\r\nmine, and such a tender wife, that she upholds my whiskers (which are\r\ninclined to be reddish) to be of the finest auburn, and does not envy\r\nMrs. Tom Hayes the sable splendors which adorn her husband's face; in\r\nshort, I see daily more occasion to thank heaven for all the happy\r\nconsequences of Dora's cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The rising tide sighs mournfully\r\n     Under the midnight moon;\r\n   The restless ocean scornfully\r\n     Dashes its surging billows down\r\n   On a jewelled beach, at the dead of night,\r\n   That in the soft and silvery light\r\n   That flits and fades, is sparkling bright,\r\n     Laved by the changing sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA VIE POÉTIQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   He is not blind who seeth nought;\r\n     Or dumb, who nothing can express;\r\n     And sight and sound are something less\r\n   Than what is inwardly inwrought.\r\n\r\n   So seems it foremost of my joys,--\r\n     Not ranking those that from above\r\n     Assume on earth the name of Love,\r\n   The feast which never ends or cloys.\r\n\r\n   Nor is it less a feast to me\r\n     If he, my neighbor, cannot break\r\n     The bread with me, or with me take\r\n   The wine of all my mystery.\r\n\r\n   Not less a feast, if so well off\r\n     He deems himself in worldly goods,\r\n     That at unseen beatitudes\r\n   He blindly flings an aimless scoff.\r\n\r\n   Not theirs the blame who thus disown\r\n     The wealth they see not as they walk,\r\n     Nor mingle in their household talk\r\n   What all to them is all unknown.\r\n\r\n   Mine be the greater joys that tend\r\n     To give me what I cannot give,\r\n     And what in living makes me live,\r\n   And what _I_ best can comprehend.\r\n\r\n   And though, amid the daily dust\r\n     Of moving men, I move a moat\r\n     Within the sunbeam where we float,\r\n   With mutual needs and mutual trust,--\r\n\r\n   Though outward unto outward shows\r\n     The kindred claims of sympathy,\r\n     And hand to hand and eye to eye\r\n   The generous meed of Faith bestows,--\r\n\r\n   Yet am I conscious that I bear\r\n     A something in me dumb and blind\r\n     To all the rest of human kind,\r\n   And which but one can partly share.\r\n\r\n   Though in the turbulent stream of change,\r\n     The pressing wants of flesh and sense\r\n     Conceal my inward opulence,\r\n   And clog the life that else would range;\r\n\r\n   Yet am I conscious that below\r\n     The turbid tide, as through the straits\r\n     Of Bab-el-Mandeb's tearful gates,\r\n   Strong counter currents constant flow.\r\n\r\n   Nor do I love that man the less,\r\n     Because, in our companionship\r\n     There lieth behind the eye and lip,\r\n   That something, neither can express.\r\n\r\n   For inasmuch as mortal love,\r\n     Being mortal, cannot fill our need,\r\n     I feel the Goodness that can feed\r\n   With droppings from the feast above.\r\n\r\n   Whereby, in Heaven's perfected plan,\r\n     Which saves from spoil of worldly flaw,\r\n     I read the inevitable law\r\n   Of compensation unto man.\r\n\r\n   Thus, though I grope in darkest night,\r\n     Of what men call a world of ills,\r\n     The closer concentration fills\r\n   My inmost with benignant light.\r\n\r\n   And though I sit in dull routine\r\n     Schooled to the scholarship of books,\r\n     My truant spirit outward looks\r\n   And Fancy fills the village green!\r\n\r\n   Yet not in pride, oh, understand,\r\n     Not pride of merit do I boast,\r\n     Of that, which at its uttermost,\r\n   Is of me part, like eye or hand.\r\n\r\n   In awe, not pride, doth Fancy wield\r\n     The sceptre of her gorgeous realm,\r\n     Whose revelations overwhelm\r\n   With sense of greatness unrevealed.\r\n\r\n   Thus, whatsoever good is gained\r\n     In fantasies of fresh delights,\r\n     But wings us to diviner flights\r\n   Unto the ever unattained.\r\n\r\n   Nor need I more than this to show\r\n     All proof of that astounding bliss,\r\n     Which from the world of worlds to this,\r\n   Through lowliest mind, sends conscious glow.\r\n\r\n   Not clearer through the density\r\n     Of darkling woods, do I behold\r\n     The intervening flecks of gold\r\n   Reveal unseen intensity.\r\n\r\n   In this deep truth I hold the key\r\n     That locks me from a world of pain,\r\n     And opens unto boundless gain\r\n   Of sweet ideal mystery.\r\n\r\n   And though I may not hope to climb\r\n     Above the level commonplace,\r\n     Or touch that vital growth of grace\r\n   Which shapes the fruit of deathless rhyme,\r\n\r\n   Yet, will I bless the Gracious Power\r\n     Which giveth strength to walk the mead,\r\n     And catch the sometime wafted seed\r\n   That ripens to the quiet flower.\r\n\r\n   Or, when, foot-weary with the day,\r\n     My longing spirit only feels\r\n     The tremor of the distant wheels\r\n   That bear some poet on his way;\r\n\r\n   I'll deem it very kindly chance\r\n     That gives the apprehension clear\r\n     To feel the pageant, far or near,\r\n   That moves to other's utterance.\r\n\r\n   And if I can but feebly keep\r\n     With reverent grace my share of good,\r\n     And kneeling, gather daily food\r\n   By gleaning, where my betters reap,\r\n\r\n   Yet will I bless the Hand Divine\r\n     That with the appetite for least,\r\n     Transforms into perpetual feast\r\n   The homely bread, the household wine;\r\n\r\n   And place it foremost of my joys,--\r\n     Not ranking those that from above\r\n     Assume on earth the name of Love,--\r\n   That feast, which never ends or cloys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASH TREE.\r\n\r\n   'The Ash for nothing ill.'--SPENSER.\r\n\r\n   'The Ash asks not a depth of fruitful mould\r\n   But, like frugality, on little means\r\n   It thrives; and high o'er creviced ruins spreads\r\n   Its ample shade, or on the naked rock,\r\n   That nods in air, with graceful limbs depends.'--BIDLAKE'S _Year_.\r\n\r\n   'Nature seems t' ordain\r\n   The rocky cliff for the wild Ash's reign.'--DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who would seek the primitive signification of all objects in\r\nNature, unroll their symbolism, and thereby attain the first historical\r\ngroundwork of poetry, must bear in mind that this system was formed,\r\nand, indeed, ripely developed, in an age anterior to all written records\r\nof humanity. By ascertaining what words are common to the Indo-Germanic\r\nlanguages, we may easily find how far in civilization those had\r\nprogressed who spoke the old Aryan, the common mother of the languages\r\nof Europe, India, and Persia, ere they parted to form new tribes, with\r\nnew tongues. So, by comparing the mythologic legends of these later\r\nraces, we may, with strictest accuracy, determine what was the parent\r\nstem. That the religion of the British Celts had striking points of\r\nresemblance with that of the Ph[oe]nicians and the Baal-worshipping\r\nShemitic races, with India and Scandinavia and the Greek and Roman\r\nsystems, is apparent enough to any one who will compare the names,\r\ncustoms, and legends common to all. It was something more than a mere\r\ncoincidence which gave to Bal of the East and Bal-der of the West the\r\nsame significant syllable.\r\n\r\nYet it must be remembered that the further back we go to the primæval\r\nage of one language and one religion, the more obscure becomes our\r\nmedium of vision. We see that tribes intermingled, exchanging and\r\ndistorting traditions of their gods; that migrations disturbed the local\r\nforce of legends; that the time for celebrating the birth of Spring in\r\nthe far South or East became sadly misplaced when transplanted to the\r\nNorth; and that, finally, the deep reverence and strange tales attached\r\nto trees, flowers, and minerals, being too deeply seated to perish, were\r\nfed by being transferred to other objects more or less similar. Thus\r\nChristmas, derived from the old heathen Yule or Wheel feast of the\r\nSeasons and of Time, and which, like all feasts, was founded in the\r\ncelebration of the revival of Spring, was actually held at last in\r\nmid-winter. So the holly and ivy, expressive of the male and female\r\nprinciples of generation, and of the great mystery of reproduction and\r\nrevival most in force during the Spring, were substitutes for other\r\nsymbols--possibly the fig leaves, lettuce, and roses which in milder\r\nclimes had at that season been employed to set forth the loves of Venus\r\nand Adonis--of reviving and of receptive nature.\r\n\r\nThe most striking illustration of this transfer of earnest religious\r\ndevotion to such objects is furnished by the ASH TREE. In the far East,\r\nmen had, during the course of ages, learned to attach extraordinary\r\nsignificance to trees, which, growing, decaying, and dying like man, yet\r\noutliving him by centuries, seemed, like animals, to be both far below\r\nand yet far above him in many of the conditions of life. In those\r\nglowing climes the Banyan was regarded as the tree of trees, and the\r\nmighty centre of vegetating life. Hence it was worshipped with such deep\r\nreverence that even in modern botany we find it named the _ficus\r\nreligiosa_; and it was called by the earlier Christians the Devil's\r\nTree, in accordance with their belief that all heathen rites were\r\noffered to Satan. For it was beneath the Banyan that Vishnu was born,\r\nand under it that Buddha taught his sacred lore; it is in it that\r\nBrahmins love to dwell; it is the living, green cathedral of GOD--the\r\nleafy cloister of sacred learning, ever holy, ever beautiful, never\r\ndying. Like GOD and NATURE, it is ever re-born; it falls drooping to\r\nearth to take fresh root, and is, on that account, as well as from its\r\nimmense size, a wonderfully apt symbol of God renewing himself--of\r\nrevival and of eternity. It is named from some saint, whose soul is\r\nbelieved to flit through its solemn shades, nay, to animate the tree\r\nitself: no wonder that in the laws of MENU it was made the sacred,\r\nnever-to-be-injured monument of a boundary.[1]\r\n\r\nTime rolled on--for the world was old then, though thousands of years\r\nhave since faded--and from the East there was a mighty emigration to\r\nlands far away. What were the causes of this mighty movement--what was\r\nit which transplanted the seeds of new nations and new races into the\r\ndistant Norway and Sweden? As yet, only dim, very dim conjecture can be\r\nmade. The Mahabharata tells us of a mighty battle which sent forth\r\nhero-sages with their armies into the wide world; others have traditions\r\nof divisions between the worshippers of the Lingam and Yoni, who\r\nalternately contended for the supremacy of the male or female principle\r\nin creation. Whatever the causes may have been--priest warring with\r\nsoldier for power, or a newer and a milder code casting off the older\r\nand more aristocratic rulers into outer darkness--one thing is certain,\r\nthat they went forth strong in faith, fearless of destiny; for the\r\nreligion of primeval times was terrible and tremendous. It was such\r\nreligion, such absolute, undoubting slavery to faith, which wore away\r\nmillions on millions of lives in carrying out in dim, old, barbarous\r\ndays the rock sculptures of the temples of Ellora--which dug Sibyls'\r\ngrots, and piled together Cyclopean walls, and pierced Cimmerian caves\r\nof awful depth and solid gloom, in the fair isles of the Mediterranean;\r\nand which, it may have been at the same time, it may have been at a\r\nlater day, massed together the miracles of Stonehenge, the enormous\r\ndragon rows of Brittany, and the almost indentically similar serpent\r\nmounds of our own West. They are all of one faith.\r\n\r\nWestward went the Æsir--the children of Light--from the land of the\r\nBanyan--_In die weite weite Welt hinaus_--out into the wild, brave\r\nworld! Some went Greekward. There is a curious book, by an English\r\nscholar, attempting to prove that the names of hill and valley, mountain\r\nand seas, in Greece, and of the countries which lead eastward to it, are\r\nall those of India but little changed. A problem awaiting the scientific\r\naccuracy of a Max Muller or a Grimm, and not to be handily tossed into\r\nshape by a poetic _Faber_, or guessed at by a wild-Irish O'Brien or\r\nVallancey, or a lunatic Betham. It is, however, worth noting that over\r\nthose South Slavonian provinces, _via_ Greece, flowed for many centuries\r\nnorthward a strangely silent stream of Orientalism, but little disturbed\r\nby the outer or upper currents of history. He who has dabbled in\r\nServian-Croat-Illyrian--twin sister to Bohemian--has doubtless been\r\namazed at the wealth of Sanscrit words it contains, albeit he may not go\r\nso far as Pococke, who asserts that with Sanscrit alone one may travel\r\nin those countries and be understood. Over this path it was, however,\r\neven down to the middle ages, that a rich store of Oriental heresies and\r\nforbidden lore flowed into freemasonry, into Waldense and Albigense\r\nsects, into many a hidden doctrine and strange brotherhood now\r\nforgotten or veiled under some horrible outbreaking of stifling passion\r\nand terrible ante-Protestantism. Over this path, on which, in earlier\r\nages, the mitre and rosary and violet robe and confessional, and\r\ndoctrines of celibacy and monkery and nun-nism, and bell and consecrated\r\ntaper, and still deeper dogmas or doctrines, wandered from the East into\r\nthe Church, came also heresies, terrible as Knights Templars', which in\r\ndue time warred against the Church, and cleft it in twain. The doctrines\r\nof wild sects, more or less Manichæan, which came forth strangely to\r\nupper life during the fever of the Crusades, all seem to tend obscurely\r\nfrom a Slavonic source. The vices with their adepti were reproached by\r\nthe Church, gave to most of the languages of Europe a revolting word,\r\nmodified from the name 'Bulgarian.' The origin of the earlier Bohemian\r\nHussite sects, with their strange devil-worship and doctrine of\r\ntransmigration, was manifestly Oriental. At a later date the very name\r\nof the mystic Jacob Böhme--Jacob the Bohemian--indicates some secret\r\nalliance with Slavonian associations; and if the connection of the name\r\nwith strange Oriental speculations be obscure, that of the teachings of\r\n'the inspired shoemaker' with those of the East is not--witness the\r\noften marvellous identity of tone of The Aurora with that of Hermes\r\nTrismegistus. It is worth while in this connection to trace the\r\ninfluence of Böhme-ism on 'the fierce sectaries of Lower Germany,' on\r\nAnabaptism, and on the _illuminati_ of the ultra Puritans in England,\r\nbringing forth Independent Fifth Monarchy men, George Fox, Flood, Law,\r\nand Pordage. The seeds of this mystical heresy were obscurely\r\ntransmitted to New England, which has always had some 'GOD-Smith,' or\r\nMathias with his 'Impostures,' lurking among the vulgar. I have no doubt\r\nthat, through traditional influence at least, a Joe Smith and the\r\nbeginning of Mormonism might be found to have a direct descent from the\r\ndoctrines of early times.\r\n\r\nLet the reader pardon the digression. I am about to speak of the Ash\r\ntree--the successor of the Banyan--which has also its connection with\r\nEnglish popular superstition. However it was, when the wave of Oriental\r\nemigration reached the utmost limits of Northern Europe, it changed its\r\ncharacter with the climate. From a vast pantheism of fire, it became one\r\nof ice and of snow. In the grammar of its mythology, only a little of\r\nthe vocabulary was retained, but the grand system of construction\r\nremained on the whole unchanged. There is the same stupendous\r\nground-plan of a cosmogony founded on a sublime view of the powers of\r\nNature, and the same exquisitely poetic elaboration of details in the\r\nEdda as in the Sacred Books of India, though the one is illumined by the\r\nburning sun of the tropics, and the other by the Northern Lights of a\r\nwinter midnight.\r\n\r\nSo the children of Odin needed a tree signifying All Creation, All Time,\r\nAll Nature, and they chose the Ash. Its picturesque beauty, its\r\nlightness and easy flowing lines, combined with great strength, and at\r\ntimes with enormous size; its elegant depending foliage and lithe vigor\r\nin its prime, and its gnarled, ancient expression when old, well fitted\r\nit to set forth the extremes of existence. The firm hold of these trees\r\nin the earth, 'their obstinate and deep rooting--_tantus amor terræ_,'\r\nas Evelyn expresses it, gives us a reason why the Ash of their mythology\r\nwas fabled to reach down to hell; while its stern vitality, expressed by\r\nHorace, fitted it to be called the tree of life:\r\n\r\n   'Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso\r\n   Ducit opes animumque ferro.'\r\n\r\n   'By havoc, wounds, and blows\r\n   More lively and luxuriant grows.'\r\n\r\nSo the Ash became the Banyan of Northern faith, and the great meeting\r\nplace of the gods--as the reader may see in the following extracts from\r\nthe Edda:\r\n\r\n     GANGLER demanded: 'Which is the capital of the Gods, or the sacred\r\n     city?' HAR answereth: 'It is under the Ash-tree YDRASIL, where the\r\n     Gods assemble every day and administer justice.' 'But,' sayeth\r\n     GANGLER, 'What is there remarkable about that place?' 'That Ash,'\r\n     answereth JARNHAR, 'is the greatest and best of all trees. Its\r\n     branches extend themselves over the whole world, and reach above\r\n     the heavens. It hath three roots, extremely different from each\r\n     other; the one of them is among the Gods; the other among the\r\n     Giants, in that very place where the abyss was formerly; the third\r\n     covereth Neflheim, or Hell, and under this root is the fountain\r\n     Vergelmer, whence flow the infernal rivers: this root is gnawed\r\n     upon below by the monstrous serpent Nidhoger. Under that root which\r\n     stretcheth out toward the land of the Giants, is also a celebrated\r\n     spring, in which are concealed Wisdom and Prudence. He who hath\r\n     possession of it is named MIMIS: he is full of wisdom, because he\r\n     drinketh thereof every morning. One day the Universal Father\r\n     (AL-FADER) came and begged to drink a cup of this water; but he\r\n     was obliged to leave in pledge for it one of his eyes, according as\r\n     it is said in the Voluspa: 'Where hast thou concealed thine eye,\r\n     ODIN? Lo! I know where; even in the limpid fountain of MIMIS. Every\r\n     morning doth MIMIS pour Hydromel upon the pledge he received from\r\n     the Universal Father. Do you, or do you not understand this?' The\r\n     third root of the Ash is in Heaven, and under it lieth the holy\r\n     fountain of Time-Past (_fons præteriti temporis--Urdar Brun_). 'Tis\r\n     here that the Gods sit in judgment. Every day they ride hither on\r\n     horseback, passing over the Rainbow, which is the Bridge of the\r\n     Gods. * * * * As for _Thor_, he goeth on foot to the tribunal of\r\n     the Gods, and fordeth the rivers Kormt and Gormt. These he is\r\n     obliged to cross every day on foot, on his way to the Ash Ydrasil,\r\n     for the Bridge of the Gods is all on fire. * * * *\r\n\r\n     'Near the fountain which is under the Ash, stands a very beautiful\r\n     city, wherein dwell three virgins, named URDA, or the Past;\r\n     VERDANDI, or the Present; and SOKULDA, or the Future. These are\r\n     they who dispense the ages of men; they are called Norn[=a]s, that\r\n     is, Fates. But there are indeed very many others besides these, who\r\n     assist at the birth of every child, to determine his fate. Some are\r\n     of celestial origin; others descend from the Genii, and others from\r\n     the dwarfs.' * * * *\r\n\r\n     'GANGLER proceeds, desiring to know something more concerning the\r\n     Ash. HAR replied: 'What I have farther to add concerning it is,\r\n     that there is an eagle perched upon its branches, who knows a\r\n     multitude of things, but he hath between his eyes a sparrow-hawk\r\n     (_qui Vederloefner vocatur_). A squirrel runs up and down the Ash,\r\n     sowing misunderstanding between the eagle and the serpent, which\r\n     lies concealed at its root. Pour stags run across the branches of\r\n     the tree, and devour its rind. There are so many serpents in the\r\n     fountain whence spring the rivers of hell, that no tongue can\r\n     recount them, as is said in these verses:\r\n\r\n   '_Fraxinus Ygdrasil plura patitur,\r\n   Quam ullus mortalium\r\n   Cogitatione assequi valeat.\r\n   Cervus depascitur inferius (rectius cacumen)\r\n   Sed circa latera putrescit.\r\n   Nidhoggius_ (the serpent) _arrodit subtus._'\r\n\r\n     'The Destinies, who reside near the fountain of the Past, draw up\r\n     water thence, with which they bedew the Ash, to prevent its\r\n     branches from growing withered and decayed. Of so purifying a\r\n     nature is that water, that whatever it touches becomes as white as\r\n     the film which is within an egg.\r\n\r\n   'Fraxinum novi stantem,\r\n   Vocatem Ygdrasil\r\n   Proceram et sacram albe luto,\r\n   Hinc venit ros,\r\n   Qui in valles cadit,\r\n   Stat super virente\r\n   Urdar fonte.'\r\n\r\n     'Men call this the honey-dew, and it is the food of bees. There are\r\n     also in this fountain two swans, which have produced all the birds\r\n     of that species.'\r\n\r\nDoes the reader care to know the meaning of all this? It is hardly worth\r\nwhile, since to those who feel its grotesque poetry quite enough of the\r\nsymbolism is already revealed. But let the plodding German FRIEDREICH\r\n'have his say.' 'The name of the Ash, Yggdrasil,' he tell us, 'signifies\r\nGod's Horse, from YGGR, a name of the god Odin, and _drasil_, the poetic\r\nterm for a horse. With this name one hath GOD'S rule over all things,\r\nsince he ruleth them even as a rider controls his steed, and by\r\n_Yggdrasil_ is consequently signified the almighty power of GOD. The Ash\r\nis the Universe, its twigs are the Ether, spread over the World-all; the\r\neagle is the Infinite glance, penetrating heaven and earth; and the\r\nsquirrel the medium by which the deeds and condition of the Gods are\r\nbrought to men. The stags, whose swiftness betokens the restless, rapid\r\npassions of man, are the ailments of the soul; and the green leaves\r\nwhich they devour, are sound, healthy thoughts.' According to Hauch\r\n(_Die Nordische Mythenlehre_, Leipsic, 1847, p. 28), these swift stags\r\nare the four winds of heaven which scatter the leaves. The snake is the\r\ndestroying force in Nature, and in the clear fountain lies wisdom--which\r\nat least teaches us the highly respectable origin of the assertion that\r\n'truth lies at the bottom of a well.' In the next spring lies the\r\nknowledge of the future--hinting at much fortune telling by means of\r\npools, and faces of future husbands in basins of water and mirrors;\r\nwhile the three virgins are the _Parcæ_--the goddesses of destiny. You\r\nknow these ladies, reader; but here they are grander, gloomier, diviner\r\nthan were our old friends Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. And the endless\r\nstrife between the eagle and the serpent, stirred up by the squirrel, is\r\nthe 'ever-battling, interchangeable action between Spirit and Matter,\r\nthe ever hence-and-hither rolling, as of waves, to good or evil in the\r\nhuman heart.'\r\n\r\nQuaint enough, yet strong, wild, and beautiful. One more explanation is\r\nhowever worth the giving. In all countries and in all ages, writers,\r\nfrom Pliny and Dioscorides down to the genial poet-author of 'Elsie\r\nVenner,' have said or hinted that the Ash is abhorred by serpents--an\r\nantipathy ridiculed by Evelyn, yet which I have heard maintained to be\r\ntrue by an eminent botanist. In our Edda legend, we find an enmity\r\nbetween the Serpent--the evil principle, and a foe to life and\r\npeace--and the Ash--the tree of fresh, vigorous life; the first ever\r\nstriving to destroy the latter. Is this the origin of the old belief? So\r\nin the 'Arcana against Enchantment,' a German book of 1715, we are told\r\nthat 'the antipathy between the Ash tree, blessed of God, and the\r\nSerpent, which so hateth man, is so great that a serpent would rather\r\nspring into the fire than into the shadow of an Ash tree.' And in\r\n_Froschmäusler_ the same idea is expressed in these quaint verses:\r\n\r\n   'Ich bin von den Alten gelart,\r\n   Der Eschenbaum hab diese Arth,\r\n   Dass keine Schlang unter ihm bleib;\r\n   Der Schatten sie auch hinweg treib,\r\n   Ja die Schlang eher ins Feuer hinleufft,\r\n   Ehe sie durch seinen Schatten schleyfft.'\r\n\r\n   'I have been by ancients told,\r\n   The Ash tree hath this gift of old,\r\n   That snake may never 'neath it stay,\r\n   The shadow drives it, e'en, away.\r\n   Sooner a snake in fire would dash,\r\n   Than through the shadow of an Ash.'\r\n\r\nThere is yet another strange superstition connected with the Ash, which\r\none hardly cares to grapple with--so vast is the mass of obscure myths\r\nand doctrines which it involves. Let it suffice to say, that from\r\ntradition and monuments, in vast variety, it appears that in very\r\nancient times the Passing Through anything was a ceremony of deepest\r\nsignificance and solemnity. To go through a door, to put on a ring, to\r\npass between upright stones (as for instance, the _dolmen_, or those of\r\nthe serpent circle of Stonehenge), to wear armlets, all referred to\r\ngoing from death into life, from ignorance to knowledge, from an\r\nunregenerate condition to reconciliation. It referred to the life\r\npassing into the womb and coming forth as birth. Going into an ark and\r\nquitting it, was one form of this Passing Through. Caves were also very\r\nholy, because they furnished apt illustrations of it. Spring was\r\ntypified as going down into the womb or cave or ark or casket or goblet\r\nof the earth, and coming forth or being poured out again in fresh\r\nbeauty. Hence it came that marriage was surrounded in earliest times by\r\nsymbols of _transit_, or Passing Through. Lovers plighted their troth in\r\nGreat Britain, as is yet done in some remote districts of Scandinavia,\r\nby joining their clasped hands through holes in the so-called Odin\r\nstones. As the Regenerate in the mysteries were obliged to pass through\r\npassages in rocks, it was naturally enough believed that those who were\r\nill might be benefited in like manner. Of course the Ash--the tree of\r\nOdin and of all the gods--was hallowed in popular belief by healing\r\nvirtues; and Evelyn tells us that 'the rupture, to which many children\r\nare obnoxious, is healed by passing the infant through a wide cleft made\r\nin the hole or stem of a growing Ash tree. It is then carried a second\r\ntime round the Ash, and caused to repass the same aperture as before.'\r\nThis act of being borne or passing around a stone or stick against the\r\ncourse of the sun, is a ceremony common to certain rites among almost\r\nall nations. It was known to Druids and Hindoos--traces of it may be\r\nfound even among the debased Fetishism which lingers among American\r\nnegroes. According to the old philosophy of planetary influences, the\r\nAsh tree is peculiar to the sun; whereas serpents are consecrated to\r\ndark and gloomy Saturn--another cause for the antipathy between them,\r\nand illustrative of the reason why the ailing child should be borne\r\naround in reference to the imaginary sympathetic solar rays of the tree.\r\n\r\nAll trivial enough, doubtless; no longer a matter worthy of deep\r\nresearch and wise marvelling. It is not even worth the while now for\r\nscholars to inveigh against the folly of such superstition. There was\r\nindeed enough of it. It was believed that by boring a hole in an ashen\r\nbough and imprisoning a mouse in it, a magic rod was obtained which\r\nwould cure lameness and cramps in cattle--the ailments being transferred\r\nto the poor mouse, who was the supposed cause of them all. 'There is a\r\nproverb, says Loudon (_Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum_, p. 1223,\r\nedition of 1838), 'in the midland countries, that if there are no keys\r\non the Ash trees, there will be no king within the twelvemonth.'\r\nLightfoot says that in many parts of the Highlands of Scotland, at the\r\nbirth of a child, the nurse or midwife puts one end of a green stick of\r\nthis tree into the fire, and, while it is burning, gathering in a spoon\r\nthe sap or juice, which oozes out at the other end, administers this as\r\nthe first spoonful of food to the newly-born baby.' Trivial enough, yet\r\nworth noting as the fragments and humble remains of what was once the\r\nmighty mythology of the Northmen, hinting at the faith in the\r\nlife-giving and life-preserving qualities of the great tree of life--the\r\ntree of knowledge of good and evil--the _eritis sicut Deus_ of Runic\r\nlore.\r\n\r\nAmong the strangest and most beautiful after-echoes of this old Norse\r\nfaith in the magic Ash as the great tree of life, is to my mind, one\r\nwhich has been preserved by Grimm in his 'Mythology' (2d edition, 2d\r\nbook, page 912), and which the German poet Hoffmann has happily turned\r\nin a poem full of spirit and grace. The legend is as follows:\r\n\r\n   In the churchyard at Nortorf will one day be an Ash,\r\n   No human eye hath seen it, yet silently it grows\r\n   Among the graves, and every year it bears a single sprout.\r\n   Each New Year's night a rider white upon a snow-white steed,\r\n   Comes silently among the graves to hew the sprout away;\r\n   But there comes a coal-black rider upon a coal-black horse,\r\n   And he strives to save the new-born tree and drive the foe afar:\r\n   Long they fight till the New Year's dawn--until black knight yields,\r\n   And the foeman hews away the twig, and rides into the dawn,\r\n   But there will come a time,'tis said, when the white knight must yield,\r\n   And the twig will grow and its leaves will blow until the trunk is\r\n     great:\r\n   So great that a proud war horse 'neath its lower branch may go.\r\n   And when the branch is grown and blown will come the world's great\r\n     fight;\r\n   The fiercest of her battles, the last great strife of dread;\r\n   And the war horse of the mighty king will stand beneath the tree,\r\n   And the king will win, and all the world will be his heritage.\r\n\r\n'The White Knight,' saith a commentator, 'is Freyr, one of the most\r\nglorious among Norse Asen, or children of the gods--he who rules over\r\nrain, sunshine, and earth's fruitfulness. His adversary is Surtur, the\r\nBlack Demon--a pitiless foe of the Asen, who in the great battle will\r\nfight with the evil Loki--'the curse and shame of gods and men'--and set\r\nheaven and earth afire. But then there will come a new heaven and a new\r\nearth, in which eternal justice shall reign, and the 'GREAT KING'--he\r\nwhose steed shall wait beneath the Ash of Life--'will rule forever in\r\npeace and holiness.'\r\n\r\nDear reader, the battle between Freyr and Surtur is ever raging--in your\r\nheart as in all the world. But whenever a great strife for freedom and\r\ntruth and man's rights is battled out, _then_ the branch has grown, and\r\nthe horse of the Great King is saddled beneath the Ash, and his rule\r\ndraws nearer than ever. Even as I write the battle rages, as it never\r\nraged before on earth, between the infernal Loki and Surtur and the\r\nglorious Asen--the great children of light and of truth. You, soldier of\r\nthe Lord, who read these lines--you, whose musket is borne in defence of\r\nthe Union, are as true a child of the great race of light as was ever\r\nOdin or Balder, and you are in this great fight fulfilling the\r\nprophecies of a thousand years aforetime, which foretold the final\r\nbattle of freedom. _You_ too are of the Northmen, the children of Odin\r\nand of Freyr, the inexhaustible race of warriors and of workmen--the\r\nfree laborers who forged the swords they wielded against the dark and\r\nwily fiend who stole his weapons from the foe ere the war began. And the\r\nHorse so easily ruled--the all-powerful WILL--stands bridled beneath the\r\neternal Ash Tree of Life; and while he lives and the tree grows, hope\r\nneed not perish, and freedom cannot die.\r\n\r\nIn a Floral Lexicon I find it stated that the Ash tree signifies\r\n'grandeur.' _E ben trovato_--it is not badly imagined--but its real\r\nmeaning is _life_, and that not mere existence, but fresh, vigorous,\r\nexuberant life, the life of action and of enjoyment. The shaft of the\r\nGreek spear, which healed the wound given by the point, was, I doubt\r\nnot, made of Ash, even as was that which slew Achilles. Thus the Ash, it\r\nwill be seen, was an important letter in the ancient alphabet of the\r\nmysteries. May I hope that when you next sit beneath its graceful\r\nboughs, you will recall some of the lore which hallows it, and makes it\r\na strange, living antique, not less curious than coin, weapon, or gem.\r\nRead it in all the significance, all the strange spirit of the old\r\nmythology, and then think what Nature must have been--or what it may yet\r\nbe--to men finding as deep a symbol as even the Ash in every high place\r\nabove the valleys, in every stream, cave, and rivulet, and in every\r\ngreen tree.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'On an island of the river Nerbudda, twelve miles beyond\r\nBroach, in the presidency of Bombay, stands the Banyan-tree, long since\r\nmentioned by MILTON, and more recently described by HEBER. It is called\r\nKUREOR BUR, after the Hindu saint who planted it.'\r\n\r\n<sc>Dierbach, _Flora Mythologica_, page 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRUM.\r\n\r\n[RÜCKERT.]\r\n\r\n   'On, the drum--it rattles so loud!\r\n     There's no such stirring sound\r\n     Is heard the wide world round,\r\n   As the drum----.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISHMAN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1860, AND JULY, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST.\r\n\r\n'The happiest people on the face of the earth, sir!'\r\n\r\nI had heard the assertion in almost all of the slave States, and knew\r\nsomething of the institution on which it was based: I was now listening\r\nto the familiar sentence at an epoch that has become historical. I sat\r\nin Charleston, South Carolina, during Secession time, December, 1860.\r\n\r\n'They are better fed and better treated than any peasantry in the\r\ncivilized world. I've travelled in Europe and seen for myself, sir. What\r\ndo you think of women--white women--working in the fields and living on\r\nnothing better than thin soup and vegetables, as they do in France, all\r\nthe year round? And a man, with a family of nine children to support,\r\nbreaking stones on the high road, in winter, for eight English shillings\r\na week? Such a thing couldn't happen in South Carolina--in all the\r\nSouth, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps not!' I didn't add that worse social wrongs might and did occur\r\ndaily, in the eulogized region; knowing the utter unprofitableness of\r\nany such discussion, not to mention its danger at a period rife with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n'You are an Englishman,' continued my interlocutor--a portly,\r\nmiddle-aged, handsome man, to whom I had been introduced just before the\r\nhotel dinner, toward the close of which our colloquy occurred--'and\r\ntherefore a born abolitionist--as a matter of sentiment, that is. You\r\nknow nothing at all about the workings of our institution, excepting\r\nwhat the d--d Yankees please to write about us, and the word _slavery_\r\nshocks you. Call it servitude, vassalage, anything else, it might be\r\nendurable enough. One of the advantages, by the way, that Secession is\r\ngoing to bring with it is, that the world will be brought into direct\r\ncontact with us, and thus see us as we are, not through the eyes of the\r\nNorth.'\r\n\r\n'You are in earnest about Secession, then?'\r\n\r\n'In earnest! by ---- I should think we were! Don't you _know_ we are,\r\nfrom what you have seen here?'\r\n\r\nI did, and a moment's reflection might have checked my thoughtless\r\ninquiry. I said so.\r\n\r\n'Yes, South Carolina's going out of the Union, with or without backers,\r\nand she intends to stay out, too; never were people more unanimous. The\r\nNorth has got so far toward being abolitionized as to elect a man\r\navowedly hostile to our institutions, and we are only providing for our\r\nsafety by seceding. It's quite time. Essentially we are a different\r\npeople: we shall be the best friends in the world separate. It's all a\r\nquestion of difference of opinion about labor; the North prefers a\r\nsystem regulated by the mercenary dictates of traffic, ruled by capital,\r\nand subject to the chronic difficulties of strikes and starvation; the\r\nSouth, a simpler relation, binding master and slave together for their\r\nmutual benefit, abolishing pauperism, and dividing society into two\r\nunmistakable, harmonious classes--the well-fed, well-cared for, happy\r\nnegro, and the wealthy, intelligent slaveowner.'\r\n\r\nI thought I had read something very like the speaker's sentiments in\r\nthat morning's _Mercury_, but didn't say so. I thought also of the\r\nexistence of another class at the South besides the two so favorably\r\ncharacterized, of which I had seen a good representative in a coarse,\r\nhalf-inebriated, shabbily dressed individual, who, just after\r\nbreakfast, had reeled through the crowd always assembled in the large\r\nhall of the hotel to exchange and discuss the news, boasting that a son\r\nof his had 'cut a man's throat the other day, down on the island,' and\r\nadmiringly wondering whether it was the paternal or maternal side that\r\nhe got his bravery from. I deemed it, however, advisable to be reticent\r\non this head. And my reward followed.\r\n\r\n'Come, Mr.----, you have been in most of the Mississippi States, I\r\nbelieve, but were never in the Carolinas before, so you don't know how\r\nwe old-fashioned folks live on our plantations. Suppose you pay me a\r\nvisit at my place on ---- Island, and see? I come of English blood,\r\nmyself; my grandfather was a Tory in the Revolution'--with a laugh--'and\r\nyou'll find us a good deal more British than you think possible here in\r\nAmerica. England and South Carolina are mother and daughter, you know;\r\nand under the influence of free trade, we're bound to be very intimate.\r\nAll we of the South ask is that our institutions shall speak for\r\nthemselves, and I can trust a Britisher's proverbial love of fair play\r\nto report us as he finds us. What do you say? I'm going down to the\r\nisland for a week on Wednesday; will you spend your Christmas with me?'\r\n\r\nThe invitation was given with an offhand cordiality decidedly\r\nprepossessing. Expressing my thanks, I at once accepted it in the spirit\r\nit was offered.\r\n\r\n'That's right! you're my guest, then;' and the Colonel--he had been\r\npresented to me by that military designation--shook me by the hand.\r\n'Will you walk?' And we strolled out together into the hall before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIf I were writing an article on Charleston in Secession time, now, here\r\nwas an opportunity for description. What a strange, what a memorable\r\nperiod it was! involuntarily reminding one of an historic parallel in\r\nthe roseate aspect presented by the early days of the first French\r\nrevolution, when everybody had hailed as the dawning of a celestial\r\nmorrow the putrescent glow of old corruption blending into the lurid\r\nfire of the coming _sans-culottic_ hell. In this case also an infernal\r\n_ignis fatuus_ had arisen to tempt its deluded followers toward a\r\nselfish fool's paradise, only to be obtained by wading through seas of\r\nfratricidal blood. And how they believed in this impossible future in\r\n'the cradle of the rebellion!' Only a minority of darker conspirators\r\napprehended--hoped for--war, thinking it necessary to precipitate the\r\nremainder of the Southern States into revolution, and the establishment\r\nof a separate nationality; the great majority of South Carolinians\r\naccepting Secession with an enthusiasm (or rather self-exaltation) and\r\nconfidence astounding to witness. There would be no collision; the North\r\ncould not and dared not push it to the extreme issue; she must endure\r\nthe punishment due to her 'fanaticism' in inevitable bankruptcy and\r\nbeggary, while the South, the seat of 'a great, free, and prosperous\r\npeople, whose renown must spread throughout the civilized world, and\r\npass down to the remotest ages' (I quote from the ordinance of\r\nSecession), had infinite possibilities before it. Jack Cade's\r\ncommonwealth, Panurge's 'world, in which all men shall be debtors and\r\nborrowers,' Gonzalo's imaginary kingdom in the _Tempest_, were not a\r\nwhit more extravagant than what was hourly talked of and expected from\r\nthis longed-for slaveholding confederacy at this time in Charleston. But\r\nenough of digression on a subject merely incidental to this narrative.\r\n\r\nThree days after my conversation with the Colonel, when the city was\r\njubilant with the passage of the act of Secession, I accompanied him to\r\nthe plantation spoken of. It involved a little steamboat journey, sundry\r\nrides in chaise or buggy, and the crossing of more than one of the many\r\ncreeks or rivers intersecting the low, sandy, swampy coast. I purposely\r\nabstain from particularizing the locality. It was toward the close of a\r\nmild, humid day when we reached the Colonel's residence.\r\n\r\nSuppose an old-fashioned two-story house, one of a very common pattern\r\nin this region, built of wood, and standing on an open foundation of\r\nbrick, with a tall, formal chimney projecting at either end, a broad\r\npiazza, and a great flight of wooden steps in front and rear, the latter\r\nlooking seaward. Like the house of Chaucer's Reeve, in summer it must\r\nhave been all 'yshadowed with greene trees,' the cedar, the cottonwood,\r\nthe liveoak, fig, mulberry, and magnolia, growing in the sand or light\r\nsoil accruing from vegetable decomposition; and as the evergreens\r\npredominated, its winter aspect was yet pleasant and rural,\r\nnotwithstanding a certain air of dilapidation and decay, so common in\r\nSouthern dwellings that the inhabitants seem to be unconscious of it.\r\nAdjacent, beyond the short avenue of orange trees by which we had\r\napproached, was a double row of negro huts, with little gardens between\r\nthem, forming a rustic lane; farther on, corn and cotton fields. The\r\ngeography of the island might be stated as follows: interior woods,\r\ngirdled by plantations, with houses on the seaboard or shores of the\r\nriver or inlets; a road circumscribing it, and one running across it.\r\n\r\nWe were welcomed by the appearance of two or three decently clad\r\nhouse-servants, mulattoes, and an athletic negro, of average\r\nnigritude,[2] every tooth in whose head glistened, as his black face\r\nrippled into a laugh, when his master favored him with some familiar and\r\napproving jocularity. Officiously taking charge of the horse and buggy,\r\nhe conveyed them to a spacious but dilapidated stable (the door of\r\nwhich, I remarked, hung only by its lower hinge), while the servants\r\nwere equally zealous in transporting what little baggage we had into the\r\nhouse. There the Colonel presented me to his daughters, two tall and\r\nrather handsome girls of the ages of eighteen and twenty, dressed in\r\ndeep mourning (their mother had died but recently), their aunt, a staid,\r\nelderly matron, who seemed installed as housekeeper, and a fat, careless\r\ngentleman in shirt sleeves, with a cigar in his mouth, who impressed me\r\nas an indolent and improvident poor relation of my host, as, indeed, he\r\nproved. There was present, also, the child of a neighbor, a little\r\nfair-haired girl, called Nelly, who, hearing my nationality mentioned,\r\nwould not approach me, which the Colonel accounted for by surmising that\r\nshe had received 'Tory' impressions of Britisher's from her parent's\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nA sincere, if a quiet welcome, and an excellent dinner, comprising fish,\r\ngame, chickens, bacon, hominy, corn and wheaten bread, and sweet\r\npotatoes of a succulence and flavor only attainable in Dixie, all served\r\nby decorous and attentive negroes, made me feel very contented with my\r\nposition. Nor were the surroundings inharmonious. We sat by a wood fire,\r\nburning in a fireplace which contained, instead of a grate,\r\nold-fashioned iron dogs: most of the furniture, with the exception of a\r\nhandsome piano, was ancient, and the room ornamented with books,\r\npictures, and mineral curiosities. Among the former I noticed a row of\r\nvolumes of British parliamentary debates in old print, contemporary with\r\nthe age succeeding Johnson. Really, as my host had boasted, his\r\nhousehold gods were decidedly English--_colonial_ English; and I began\r\nto understand the peculiar, ante-revolutionary, patrician\r\ncharacteristics on which he and his class evidently prided themselves.\r\nHe showed me a portrait of an ancestor who had held high office in the\r\ndays of Governor Oglethorpe, an old-fashioned miniature on ivory,\r\ncharmingly painted, in the style of Malbone, and one could easily\r\nrecognize in it the features of his descendant. In conversing, too, on\r\nthe early history of the State, of which he had much to say that I\r\nfound interesting, he always assumed that a popular, democratic form of\r\ngovernment was rather a mistake than otherwise,[3] and, without\r\nabsolutely condemning the Revolution, implied that South Carolina had\r\nbeen moved to her limited share in it against her direct interests, by a\r\nhigh-spirited patriotism and sympathy with the at present ungrateful and\r\nvenal North. I do not think that the fact of my nationality influenced\r\nhim in this; he evidently spoke his convictions.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were at first reserved, acting, I believe, under the\r\nimpression that their father's brief knowledge of me hardly warranted my\r\nintroduction to his family; indeed, I am sure it was exceptional, from\r\nall I have since learned of South Carolinian society. The casual\r\nmention, however, of the names of a few mutual acquaintances, of\r\nunexceptional 'blue blood,' and the fact that both ladies had visited\r\nEurope, establishing topics of conversation, they presently warmed into\r\ncordiality. I found them well informed and agreeable, less demonstrative\r\nin their self-assertion than their Northern sisterhood, but latently\r\nwilful, and assumptive of a superior elevation hardly justified by their\r\ngeneral air of languid refinement. It reminded me, on the whole, of what\r\nI had heard complacently eulogized in Charleston as a tendency toward\r\n'Orientalism' on the part of the women, of which the characteristics\r\nwere repose, fastidiousness, and exclusiveness--one of the many\r\nadmirable results of the fundamental institution.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were, of course, ardent secessionists, expressing themselves\r\nwith a bitterness, an acrimony, an unreasonableness, which might have\r\nastonished me, had I been capable of such a feeling on the subject.\r\nInevitably we slid on to it, when I learnt that their only brother was\r\naway doing military duty on Sullivan's Island, and so zealous in the\r\ndischarge of his assumed obligations that he intended to spend his\r\nChristmas in camp, not, as usual, upon the plantation.\r\n\r\n'You'll be sorry to hear that, Pomp,' said the Colonel to an evidently\r\nfavorite servant, who had waited upon us most assiduously, and who was\r\nthen kneeling before the fat gentleman, and putting a pair of slippers\r\non his feet. He, by the way, had contributed very little to the\r\nconversation, only assenting, smiling, and looking the picture of ease\r\nand good humor, as he sat lazily beaming behind a tumbler full of\r\nBourbon whiskey and water.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sar!' the negro answered, 'too bad, mass' Philip not come home for\r\nde holidays. All de people 'spect him.'\r\n\r\n'That's a first-rate boy,' said his master, as the negro left the room\r\nto fetch something; 'I wouldn't take two thousand dollars for him.'\r\n(Every one familiar with the South, must have heard similar encomiums\r\nhundreds of times: each household appears to pride itself on the\r\npossession of some singularly admirable negro, whose capacity, honesty,\r\nand fidelity are vaunted with an air of conscious magnanimity edifying\r\nto witness. The desired inference is that the institution, productive of\r\nso much mutual appreciation, _must_ be excellent. It never seems to\r\noccur to the eulogists that the good is exceptional, or that the praised\r\ncharacteristics might be alleged as an argument for emancipation.)\r\n\r\n'That boy has been North with me,' the Colonel continued, 'to\r\nWashington, Philadelphia, and as far as New York. The abolitionists got\r\nhold of him at the last place, and wanted to run him off to Canada, but\r\nPomp preferred old Carolina. You don't want to be free, do you, Pomp?'\r\n\r\nThis was a leading question. The slave hesitated a moment, grinned, and\r\nevaded it,\r\n\r\n''Pears like de colored people at de Norf was mostly a mis'able set,' he\r\nanswered: _'can't shum!'_\r\n\r\n'You can't see it!' said his master, delighted, and translating a very\r\npopular negro phrase for my benefit. And incontinently he launched into\r\na defence and eulogium of slavery, which I shall not oblige my readers\r\nto skip by recording. The topic is one on which Southerners are never\r\nwearied; and a more uneasy people on the subject than South Carolinians\r\nit would be impossible to imagine: long before Secession, they existed\r\nin a state of chronic distrust and suspicion about it amounting to\r\nmonomania.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day I accompanied the Colonel over his plantation. It was a large\r\none, somewhat over seven hundred acres, inclusive of forest land, about\r\ntwo thirds being reclaimed upland swamp soil growing seaisland cotton.\r\nAn old family estate, most of the negroes belonging to it had been born\r\nthere or in the immediate vicinity; there were about two hundred of\r\nthem, some living near their master's house, as has been mentioned, the\r\nrest in a sort of colony at the other end of the plantation, under the\r\neye of the overseer. These negro settlements merit a paragraph of\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nTheir huts were of wood, separate, and standing in little gardens, in\r\nwhich each family enjoyed the privilege of cultivating patches of corn,\r\nsweet potatoes, and such vegetables as they chose, a street of about a\r\nhundred feet wide dividing the houses. Midway, under the shade of a\r\nmagnificent liveoak, whose branches were mournful with the funereal moss\r\n(always suggestive to my fancy of the 'little old woman,' whose\r\nemployment in the nursery legend is 'to sweep the cobwebs out of the\r\nsky,' having executed her task in a slovenly manner), was a simple\r\napparatus for grinding corn, consisting of two heavy circular stones,\r\nplaced horizontally in a rude frame under a shed, to be worked by manual\r\npower, by upright wooden handles. This served as a mill for the entire\r\nnegro population.\r\n\r\nEntering their huts, you were first conscious of a large brick\r\nfireplace, in which a fire was almost constantly burning, though it\r\nscarcely lit up the generally dark interior, always much, more\r\npicturesque than comfortable, for negroes have little if any notion of\r\nventilation, and can hardly be too warm: they will kindle great blazing\r\nfires to lie down by or to heat their food, in the open fields in\r\nsummer. A few roughly fashioned seats and tables, and a ladder\r\nstaircase, leading upward to an attic or cockloft, completes the\r\ninventory of the interior.\r\n\r\nWe had passed the inhabitants of these huts, at work in the fields,\r\nunder the direction of the overseer, a strong, spare man, in a suit of\r\nhomespun, who rode about among them on horseback, carrying in his hand a\r\ncowhide whip, which he had exhibited to me with a smile, and the remark\r\nthat 'that was the thing the Yankees made so much noise about.' It was a\r\nsufficient instrument of punishment, I thought and said, adding that I\r\ntrusted he found infrequent occasion for the exercise of it.\r\n\r\n'Well, they're a pretty well behaved lot generally,' he answered, with\r\nthat peculiar accent derived from almost exclusive association with\r\nnegroes common throughout the South; 'but sometimes it 'pears as if the\r\ndevil had got in among 'em, and I has to lay on all round. A nigger will\r\nbe a nigger, you know.'\r\n\r\nThe subjects of this ethical remark were rather raggedly dressed, the\r\nmen in coarse jackets and trousers, the women in soiled and burnt gowns\r\nof indefinite color, generally reefed up about the hips for convenience\r\nin working. (Their dilapidation, it may be remarked, was due to the\r\nclose of the year; they would get new clothes, the Colonel remarked, at\r\nChristmas.) They seemed, however, well fed, not too hardly tasked, and,\r\nfrom a sensual point of view, happy and contented. The Colonel spoke to\r\nthose nearest him patronizingly, asked after absent or sick members of\r\ntheir families, joked about the coming Christmas, and the 'high time'\r\nimpending, and inquired how many marriages were to come off on the\r\noccasion--the negroes generally deferring their nuptials till the great\r\nholiday of the year. He was answered by a perfect shout of negro\r\nlaughter, hearty, infectious, irresistible.\r\n\r\n'Come, how many is there to be?' he repeated, joining in their mirth.\r\n\r\n'Six!' the overseer responded, seeing that the negroes did not reply\r\nexcept by continued guffaws.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sa! _ya! ya_ bound to have a high old _Secesshum_ time dis\r\nChristmas! _ya! ya!_' added a gray-headed old darky, quite overcome with\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n'Why, you'll ruin the young ladies in finding frocks for the girls!'\r\nsaid the Colonel; 'who are these future happy couples, eh?'\r\n\r\n'Sal's Joe, sa!' 'Polly's Sue!' 'Big Sam!' 'Pinckney!' 'Cal!' 'Peter!'\r\n'Jule!' and a variety of names were shouted out, not by the owners of\r\nthem. With a great deal of shyness and simpering and half-suppressed\r\ngrinning, and real or affected modesty on the part of the women, and\r\nequal mirth and awkward self-consciousness on that of the aspirant\r\nbridegrooms, the candidates for matrimony--or at least such of them as\r\nwere present, one couple and a 'boy' being away--were got together and\r\nranged in a row before us, hoes in hand, where they stood, to their own\r\nand the boisterous delight of their colaborers. They appeared generally\r\nyoung, healthy, and well-looking negroes, some of them handsome in an\r\nAfrican sense. The Colonel surveyed them with much good nature and\r\nsatisfaction; he was evidently gratified at the prospect of so many\r\nmarriages among his own negroes; unions 'off the plantation' being\r\nlooked on with disfavor by proprietors, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said, after addressing a few remarks to them, individually;\r\n'I must talk with the young ladies, and see what we can do for you. If\r\nBones (the sobriquet of a negro-preacher, belonging to the estate) won't\r\nbe jealous, I think I'll try and get Mr. ---- over, to marry the whole\r\nbatch of you in high style, eh?'\r\n\r\nThe prospect of a white clergyman, an honor generally reserved only for\r\nthe marriages of favorite house-servants, seemed to afford unmitigated\r\nsatisfaction to the field hands. They laughed again, thanked their\r\nmaster, assured him of the perfect willingness of their colored pastor\r\nto resign his functions for the time being, in view of the superior\r\ndignity accruing to the occasion from the presence of Mr.----, and we\r\nrode off amid a chorus of jubilations.\r\n\r\n'What would an abolitionist say to that scene, do you think?' asked the\r\nColonel, as we galloped homeward to dinner.\r\n\r\n'Probably he'd admit that slavery has its pleasant side, but insist on\r\nlooking at both,' I answered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An inquiry instituted by Gen. Hunter, at Hilton Head, S.\r\nC., during the past summer, for eight negroes of unmixed African\r\ndescent, resulted in the total failure of the discovery of even one. So\r\nmuch for practical Southern amalgamation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was generally credited in Charleston, that, subsequent\r\nto Secession, the convention had debated the advisability of attempting\r\nsome monarchical experiment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO BEAT?\r\n\r\n\r\n   But warlike casuists can't discuss,\r\n   If we beat them, or they beat us;\r\n   We swear we beat, they swear we lie--\r\n   We'll tell you more on't _by and by_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson Davis and his coadjutors so defiantly and with so much\r\napparent confidence entered on the path of rebellion, they probably did\r\nnot foresee the abyss into which they were about to plunge. They rushed\r\neagerly forward at the first call to battle; but they hardly paused to\r\nconsider how fearful a thing it is to light the flames of civil war\r\namong a people long accustomed to peace and security; to marshal\r\nopposing armies drawn from the late happy dwellings of the same\r\ncommunity, arraying in deadly conflict father against son, and brother\r\nagainst brother; to add fiery devastation and reckless destruction of\r\nproperty horrid carnage and the saddest bereavements of all kinds; and\r\nto replace brotherhood of a common country, a common ancestry, and a\r\nglorious history, with the relentless enmities engendered by rebellion\r\nand revolution. What wrongs and sufferings, endured by our brethren of\r\nthe South, or likely to imposed on them by the National Government,\r\nwould have been sufficient to steel their hearts against the heavy\r\ncalamities they have encountered and inflicted, or to justify the\r\nimmense waste desolation already suffered in both sections, in\r\nconsequence of this most unnatural and fratricidal war? The most\r\nordinary charity would lead to the belief, that if the mighty woes which\r\nhave followed in the bloody path of the rebellion could have been\r\nanticipated, even the bold, bad leaders, and still more the infatuated\r\npeople, would have suffered much and hesitated long before assuming the\r\ndread responsibility. Hate itself, though reënforced and supported by\r\nall other passions of a fiendish nature, would have stood aghast at the\r\noverwhelming avalanche of horrors which hung ready to be precipitated on\r\nour unhappy country. It is hardly within the limits of human depravity,\r\nthat evils of such magnitude, attended by such world-wide results,\r\nshould be attributable to the deliberate will and arbitrary action of\r\neven the worst members of the human family. For the credit of our common\r\nhumanity, let it be admitted that the authors of the fatal movement did\r\nreally believe In their avowed doctrine of peaceable secession, and that\r\nthey could not have had the least idea of the immense proportions the\r\ncivil war was destined to assume, nor of the extent of ruin and misery\r\nit would necessarily drag in its horrid train. And if the prominent\r\nleaders did not intend all the sad consequences of their wicked act of\r\ntreason, still less can they be considered personally responsible for\r\nthe fatal popular enthusiasm which has so thoroughly sustained them in\r\ntheir section. Though full of hate and animated by a spirit of infernal\r\nmischief, they had not the capacity to stir a nation so profoundly,\r\nexcept from the fact that they were dealing with minds already well\r\nprepared for their impassioned appeal, and with elements which had been\r\nwrought into discord by causes long preëxisting.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this stupendous conflict, individuals seem to be as\r\ninsignificant and powerless to control it, as if they stood, awed and\r\nsubdued by the warring elements of nature, and compelled to wait until\r\nthese should expend their fury and of themselves subside. Thirty\r\nmillions of people have been suddenly and unexpectedly divided, and the\r\nsundered parts have been thrown into fierce and deadly antagonism.\r\nBelligerent passions rage and boil among them with all the ungovernable\r\npower of the angry waves when the sea is lashed by the destructive\r\ntempest. The throes of the suffering nation are as terrible as those of\r\nthe trembling earth, when, by some internal convulsion, its very\r\nfoundations seem to be rocked on the fiery waves of the central abyss,\r\nand every living creature on its surface becomes agitated with profound\r\ndismay. States have been temporarily but rudely torn from their long and\r\npeaceful connections with sister States, and great rents in the\r\npolitical soil, filled with the bodies of slaughtered citizens, mark the\r\nlines of separation. Vast armies have been assembled and organized, and\r\nhave met each other in the shock of battle, on fields made slippery with\r\nfraternal blood, where tens of thousands have fallen to rise no\r\nmore--swept down by the relentless storm of iron hail with which brother\r\nhas greeted brother in this most unholy war. The measured tramp of the\r\narmed hosts has shaken the continent; and the vengeful cries of the\r\nunnatural strife have disturbed the inmost peaceful recesses of its\r\ngreat central plains and mountains. From California to Texas; from\r\nColorado to New Mexico; from Maine to New Orleans; from the great lakes\r\nto the coasts of the Carolinas; and along the measureless length of 'the\r\nfather of waters' and his great tributaries, the gathering armies have\r\nmarched or sailed, and swarmed to the beat of the drum and the sound of\r\nthe trumpet. More than a million of men, on both sides, have been\r\nengaged in these tremendous movements, which unhappily correspond too\r\nwell in their unexampled magnitude with the physical character of our\r\nmagnificent country. Civil war has sacrilegiously usurped the mighty\r\ninstrumentalities of modern peaceful life; and the bloody and\r\ndestructive work of these vast armies is not less gigantic in scale than\r\nhave been the ordinary operations of our wonderful industry and our\r\never-increasing commerce. The sacrifice of life, the destruction of\r\nproperty, the desolation of extensive regions of beautiful and fertile\r\ncountry, the vast expenditure of public means, all concur to\r\ncharacterize this as the grandest and most terrible phenomenon of the\r\nkind that has ever occurred in the history of man. To us, who are in the\r\nmidst of it, and destined to be involved in its results, whatever they\r\nmay be, it is a subject of deep and awful interest; and while the scenes\r\nof the momentous drama are continually shifting around us and presenting\r\nnew spectacles of slaughter and disaster every day, it is hardly\r\npossible to maintain the calmness necessary for an impartial\r\nappreciation of the causes which have been sufficiently powerful to turn\r\nthe destructive energies of so great a nation upon itself, causing it to\r\nrend and destroy its own body politic, so recently rejoicing in\r\nunexampled prosperity and happiness. Some gigantic power, wielding\r\nstrength enough to produce the tremendous results already visible, must\r\nbe somewhere hidden at the source of these grand phenomena. In the\r\nphysical world, a small quantity of water or a few kegs of powder,\r\nflashing into steam or gas by the application of heat, may be used to\r\noverthrow the most stupendous material fabrics which the labor and\r\ngenius of men have ever been able to erect. What fatal means of\r\ndestruction, and what traitorous hand have been employed to drill and\r\ncharge the solid columns, or to mine the deep foundations of that\r\nbeautiful and majestic structure of liberty, which our fathers reared\r\nfor us with so much labor and sacrifice?\r\n\r\nThere is only one force adequate to the destructive work--the force of\r\nfalse and mischievous ideas. Ideas have in them the elements of all\r\npower. They alone move the moral and social world. Penetrating every\r\ncrevice of the social structure, they have the force of attraction and\r\nrepulsion; they consolidate and strengthen, or, like frost and heat,\r\nthey rend and crumble the hardest material, either slowly or suddenly,\r\nas circumstances and conditions may permit or require. They have in them\r\nall the terrible might, with all the explosive and dangerous quickness,\r\nwhich belong to the most destructive of physical forces. When, in any\r\ncommunity, ideas are harmonious, they have an organizing power wholly\r\nindependent of their soundness or of their ultimate stability; but when\r\ndiscordant and conflicting, they produce disorganization, ruin, and\r\nchaos.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for our country, opposite and hostile ideas have been\r\ngrowing up among us from the beginning of our national existence--nay,\r\nfrom the very hour when the first cargo of slaves was landed on our\r\nshores in the earliest days of our colonial history. Conflicting systems\r\nhave naturally grown out of these hostile ideas, which have thus\r\nembodied themselves in the visible forms appropriate to their respective\r\nnatures. The colonial authorities protested against the policy of\r\nimporting slaves, which the mother country persisted in maintaining,\r\nuntil powerful interests were gathered around it, and opinions were thus\r\nnurtured to support and defend the fatal error. Slaveholding communities\r\narose out of this sinister beginning; they flourished and became\r\npowerful States; and they finally presented the anomaly of maintaining a\r\nnoble struggle for national independence, avowedly based upon the\r\nbroadest principle of human right. They aggregated themselves,\r\neventually, into a federal union--a political nationality founded on\r\n'the corner stone' of liberty, and not of slavery. In view of all the\r\ncircumstances, this was a wonderful result; but the old original\r\nopposition, which had been incapable of resisting slavery in the days of\r\ncolonial infancy and weakness, had not yet been subdued on the day when\r\nthe nation arrived at its majority and assumed the rights of manhood.\r\nThe venerable patriots of the revolution were men of the most\r\nenlightened and liberal views on the subject; so much so, indeed, as to\r\nshame the degeneracy of their unworthy successors in those States which\r\nstill retain the slave institution. With the general consent, in the\r\nConstitution of 1787, the germs of freedom were planted, while at the\r\nsame time, apparently as a matter of course, the flourishing tree of\r\nslavery was effectually girdled, and the axe was already laid at its\r\nroot. Three very simple provisions effectually secured this momentous\r\nresult. The provision for stopping the slave trade in 1808, and the\r\nantagonist clause for opening wide the gates of our country to the\r\nimmigration of free white men, together with that which restricted the\r\nrepresentation of slave populations in the proportion of three to\r\nfive--these cardinal provisions marked the certain doom of slavery. In\r\nthe lapse of time, and with the operation of ordinary social causes, the\r\nresult was as certain and inevitable as any other effect of natural\r\nlaws. In spite of the universal prevalence of slavery at first, free\r\nlabor pushed itself forward and won its way, until, in more than half\r\nthe original States, slave labor had receded before it and disappeared\r\nforever. The wisdom of those great fundamental provisions of our\r\nConstitution has been fully vindicated by the results of eighty years'\r\nexperience. They have worked smoothly and progressively, in perfect\r\nconformity with that universal social law which, has made slavery a\r\ntemporary and transitional institution wherever it has existed among\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\nThat such a law exists can hardly be questioned. Its operation is\r\napparent, not only in the partial experience of our own country, but in\r\nthat of all others where the natural social tendencies have had\r\nunimpeded sway. No one has ever denied its existence among the white\r\nraces; for there it has operated invariably to bring certain\r\nemancipation, whenever any nation has reached the proper position in the\r\nscale of progress. The rule is universal; history presents no exception.\r\nBut it has been supposed that slavery of the African to the white man is\r\nnot subject to this great historical law, on account of the difference\r\nof race, whether that difference be fundamental and ineradicable, or\r\nwhether it be only the consequence of material conditions operating\r\nthrough successive centuries. Neither reason nor experience, however,\r\ncan be invoked to sustain this supposed exception to the general law.\r\nExcept in Spanish America, African slavery has disappeared from the\r\ndependencies of European powers; and even there, every one knows, the\r\nconditions of slavery are far more favorable to emancipation than in\r\nthe United States. Yet here, a majority of the original thirteen\r\ncolonies have wholly discarded slavery, and given themselves up to the\r\ndominion of free white men; while others among those known as border\r\nStates, notwithstanding their apparent immobility, have long been\r\nunconsciously preparing to follow in the same path of safety. Even\r\nwithout the rebellion, it is demonstrable, we believe, that the border\r\nStates could not long have resisted the necessity for gradual, but\r\ncomplete emancipation. The civil war makes it more speedy, not more\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish the principle that slavery, in any part of the\r\nUnited States, is destined to be an exception to that general law which\r\ndecrees universal emancipation as a certain result, it would be\r\nnecessary to show the negro to be incapable of improvement; for if he be\r\ndestined to progressive existence at all, it follows that, sooner or\r\nlater, he will reach a condition in which he no longer can or ought to\r\nbe held in subjection or subordination of any kind; and this, too,\r\nwithout the supposition of any moral change or improvement on the part\r\nof the slave owner. Indeed, the most usual and plausible, if not also\r\nthe most truly substantial of all excuses or justifications for\r\nenslaving the African, in any form, has, from the beginning, been\r\npredicated on the fact that his subordination to the superior\r\nintelligence of the white man is calculated to improve him physically,\r\nmorally, and intellectually. The capacity of improvement thus admitted,\r\nthe logical result must be eventual liberation. This result is bound up\r\nin the very nature of things, and must inevitably be developed at some\r\ntime or other, as proved by all history, as well as by any rational\r\nanalysis of human character and intellect. But, only one half the\r\nargument has been employed to bring the mind to this irresistible\r\nconclusion. We have omitted all examination of the subject in that other\r\naspect which has reference to industrial, economical, and moral\r\nconsiderations affecting the vital interests of the superior race. We\r\nneed not say how much the discussion of these would serve to strengthen\r\nthe argument and confirm the conclusion already stated.\r\n\r\nNow, it is apparent, this reasoning being admitted, that the attempt to\r\nperpetuate slavery, which in its nature is temporary and transitional,\r\nis contrary to the palpable laws of social existence and progress, and,\r\nif persisted in beyond a certain point, must inevitably lead to violence\r\nand disorder. Nature, the supreme authority, by her unalterable laws,\r\nwills and decrees one thing; man, in his ignorance and audacity,\r\nattempts the opposite. Conflict must necessarily follow; but the decrees\r\nof the higher power will be inexorably enforced; they will sweep away\r\nevery structure, great or small, which man, in all the pride of his puny\r\nstrength and glimmering wisdom, may vainly seek to place as an\r\nobstruction in their path. But, when the Southern people adopted this\r\nfalse idea, that slavery could be perpetuated and made the foundation of\r\nstable institutions, they not only placed themselves in conflict with\r\nthe decrees of natural law, which was the most important and fatal\r\nerror, but they also indicated hostility to those vital provisions of\r\nthe Constitution to which reference has already been made. No thoughtful\r\nobserver of events in this country will require evidence to sustain this\r\nassertion. The constant evasion of the law prohibiting the slave trade,\r\nand the impunity with which it was frequently and sometimes openly\r\nviolated, as well as the known public opinion throughout the South on\r\nthis subject and on that of European immigration, are quite sufficient\r\nto establish it. The violent resistance, by fraud and even bloodshed, to\r\nthe settlement of the Territories by free white men, and the determined\r\neffort to establish the law of slavery in every region, against even the\r\nvote of the majority, and without any actual interest or necessity for\r\nso doing, evince too plainly that the Southern people were not prepared\r\nto accept the results of the proper workings of the Constitution, which\r\ngave preponderance, in the number of States and in Federal\r\nrepresentation, to the ever-increasing free white men, against the\r\nrelatively diminishing numbers of the slaves and their owners. This\r\ninequality of power was continually becoming greater, and evidently\r\ncould not be avoided or remedied under the Constitution, without a\r\ncomplete reversal of the policy of its framers, and of the\r\ncontemporaneous construction which they placed on it.\r\n\r\nThus it is plain that by the legitimate and intended operation of the\r\nConstitution, slavery had come to that stage of its existence, when it\r\nmust either prepare for its own gradual decline and ultimate\r\ndisappearance, or it must provide means for invigorating and prolonging\r\nits life. There was only one way in which its power could be increased\r\nand for some time yet firmly established, viz.: by the reopening of the\r\ninfamous and almost universally condemned African slave trade. This\r\nwould have accomplished a double purpose. It would have increased the\r\nnumbers of the South, and enabled them measurably to balance the\r\nrepresentation of the North, as well as to extend their dominion over\r\nthe Territories, and lay the foundations of new States; or, in case of\r\ntheir success in destroying the Union, it would enable them to carry out\r\ntheir cherished schemes of empire, as an independent power. But, what\r\nwas, perhaps, more important, it would tend to prolong, if not to\r\nperpetuate slavery, by infusing new supplies of barbarism among the\r\nAfrican race, lowering their present grade of civilization, retarding\r\ntheir improvement on the whole, and thus postponing the inevitable day\r\nof their liberation.\r\n\r\nThere are strong indications, in the early proceedings of the\r\nconspirators, that they seriously entertained the design of replenishing\r\ntheir gangs of laborers from the shores of Africa. It was only after the\r\ncontest had assumed a serious aspect, and the immense difficulties of\r\ntheir position began to dawn upon them, that they were compelled\r\nostensibly to abandon that design. They were compelled to conciliate the\r\nborder States, which were all opposed to the foreign slave trade.\r\nVirginia, whose chief annual income was derived from the sale of her\r\nslave population, rather than from the productions of their labor, was\r\nan indispensable ally to the rebellion, and she would hardly assent to\r\nthe importation of Africans, in competition with her own supply.\r\nMoreover, it began to be obvious that the aid of foreign powers would be\r\ndesirable; and their intervention, if to be obtained at all, could not\r\nbe solicited or hoped for, without the most explicit disavowal of an\r\nintention to reëstablish a traffic which had already been denounced as\r\ninfamous and piratical by the leading powers of the world. The rebels,\r\ntherefore, were compelled by the exigencies of their condition to\r\nprohibit the slave trade in their permanent constitution. Doubtless they\r\nwould never have done this, had they not been vigorously assailed by the\r\nFederal Government, and forced to modify their purposes with a view to\r\nconciliate support at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThus it is apparent that, at the outset of their treason, the objects of\r\nthe conspirators, however since modified, were utterly hostile to the\r\nletter and spirit of our Constitution, and could never be successfully\r\ncarried out without the overthrow of the Government. The conflict,\r\ntherefore, of opposite ideas, involved not only the laws of nature,\r\nwhich cannot be altered or arrested, but, also, established institutions\r\nof the most sacred character, which could hardly be expected to succumb\r\nto the hostile doctrine without a fearful struggle.\r\n\r\nIn what manner this conflict of opinions and purposes becomes\r\ntransformed into physical combat and culminates in bloody war, is to be\r\neasily understood when the relations of human intellect and passion are\r\nduly considered. All philosophy teaches that the intellect is the weaker\r\nand less active part of human nature. Passion generally predominates in\r\naction, and men are usually more disposed to resist with violence all\r\nunwelcome ideas, than to study and estimate them fairly by the laborious\r\nexercise of reason. Hence, from the early historical ages, when nations\r\nwere but imperfectly enlightened, wars have been the principal means of\r\npropagating ideas; and most of the great social truths gradually\r\nunfolded to man, have been written in blood for his instruction and\r\nimprovement. Doubtless, if human nature had been different, if passion\r\nand intellect in his constitution had been mingled in other proportions,\r\nit would have been easier, if not better, to have disseminated great\r\ntruths by the more peaceful means of argument and friendly communication\r\nof thought; and it is to be hoped that the time is not far distant when\r\nreason will everywhere take the place of passion, and brutal force no\r\nlonger be necessary for the work of intellectual conviction and moral\r\nenlightenment. But, evidently, this time has not yet arrived for the\r\npeople of our Southern States, whatever may be the condition in this\r\nrespect of the more civilized and enlightened portions of mankind. Nor,\r\nindeed, could any different disposition of the Southern people he\r\nexpected in their present social condition. One third of their\r\npopulation is composed of African slaves, semicivilized, systematically\r\ndeprived of knowledge, and subjected to physical coercion, instead of\r\nbeing incited to usefulness by the higher motives of self-interest and\r\nlaudable ambition. To say that this is a degraded class, is only to\r\nrecognize their supreme misfortune, and not to reproach or insult them\r\non account of their unhappy condition. But this degradation does not\r\naffect them alone. It reaches their oppressors also, and involves them\r\nin its unavoidable consequences. By that inevitable law of action and\r\nreaction which prevails alike in moral and social as in physical\r\nphenomena, the community which has so large a portion of its members in\r\na condition of ignorance and brutality, must, throughout its whole body,\r\npartake of the degradation which exists within it, and must be affected,\r\nby the very contact, in all its feelings, sentiments, and purposes,\r\nthrough the gross and ignorant passions which such an association cannot\r\nfail to arouse. The moral level of the whole society is lowered to the\r\naverage condition of its constituent parts. To expect the controlling\r\npower of such a community to be accessible to reason and conciliation,\r\nwould indeed argue an utter ignorance of the whole slave system and of\r\nits influence upon the minds and hearts of those who sustain it. War is\r\nthe normal condition of those communities which cherish slavery; and\r\nalthough such an institution, misplaced in connection with the\r\ncivilization of the nineteenth century, may seem to have changed its\r\noriginal nature in accordance with existing circumstances, yet, when its\r\npurposes are thwarted, it is ever ready for military violence. It is\r\nlike a native barbarian, schooled and trained to apparent civilization,\r\nbut ever inclined, at the first temptation, to fall into his natural\r\nhabits of wild and savage life. The Southern organization has already\r\nproved itself to be peculiarly fitted for warlike operations; it has\r\nbeen correspondingly unsuited to modern industrial pursuits, except for\r\nthe simplest and most primitive of all labors, those of agriculture.\r\nIndeed, these were always the principal occupations of slaves, even in\r\nthose early stages of human progress when these classes were left at\r\nhome to till the soil, while the masters followed their ordinary\r\noccupation of war. The same constitution of society at the present day\r\nleaves the masters free, it is true, to engage in more humane and\r\nelevated occupations, but not without an evident inclination or easy\r\nadaptation for those bold and bad pursuits from which slavery originally\r\narose, and which it afterwards contributed so much to sustain and\r\nprolong.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding this natural inclination of slaveholders toward\r\ncommotion and war, it is not to be denied, on the other hand, that in\r\ncivil conflicts like ours, in which discordant opinions and important\r\nlocal interests are involved, the issue of peace or war may to a great\r\nextent be controlled by that party which has the right of the\r\ncontroversy. Its conduct may be forbearing and conciliatory, or it may\r\nbe insulting and calculated to invite resistance. A magazine may be\r\ndangerous in itself, for an accidental spark or an unintended friction\r\nof apparently harmless substances may cause it to explode; but, at the\r\nsame time, the catastrophe may be brought on by the wilful folly of\r\nthose whose duty it is to provide the necessary precautions against\r\ndanger. The North has unquestionably been right in the contest on\r\nslavery, as to all the moral and economical aspects of the question; and\r\ngenerally, too, us to all the political principles involved. But has she\r\nnot been violent and abusive--so offensively obtruding into the local\r\naffairs of the opposite section, as unnecessarily to arouse the angry\r\npassions of the South, rather than to encourage the calm exercise of\r\nreason? The answer to this question is by no means so obvious and easy\r\nas may at first be supposed. The whole subject has been so complicated\r\nwith party movements, that it becomes impossible to follow the\r\nramifications of influence, and to determine what share individuals or\r\nparties, on one side or the other, may have had in the responsibility\r\nfor the angry controversy, its aggravating incidents, and its general\r\nresults. This, however, is certain: the slaveholders have for many years\r\ncontrolled the Democratic party, and that organization has held the\r\npower of government in its hands during far the greater part of our\r\nnational existence. Important concessions have been made to their\r\ninterests, from time to time, during the whole period; and no single\r\ninstance of actual wrong to the South, by the violation, of any\r\nacknowledged constitutional right, can be designated, in the whole\r\naction of the Federal Government from the time of its establishment down\r\nto the commencement of this rebellion.\r\n\r\nNor can it be denied, that while in power with the Democratic party and\r\nascendant in its counsels, the South has been exacting in the extreme,\r\nand has often made demands wholly incompatible with the true interests\r\nof liberty and humanity. Witness the offensive form in which the\r\nfugitive slave law was passed, and its execution enforced in the North,\r\nwholly regardless of the natural and irrepressible sympathies of a\r\nhumane people; and, on the other hand, the unnecessary and sinister\r\nexcitement deliberately aroused and kept up, in the extreme Southern\r\nStates, on this subject of fugitives, although it is well known that no\r\nconsiderable losses of that kind have ever been suffered in that\r\nquarter. So likewise as to slavery in the Territories. It has often been\r\nadmitted by Southern statesmen of the extreme school, that the\r\nTerritories recently organized, over which so much bitter controversy\r\nhas occurred, are altogether unsuited in climate and productions for the\r\nemployment of slave labor; and few will deny, whether those Territories\r\nbe physically adapted or not adapted to the labor of Africans, that the\r\nSouth had not the means of populating them without an increase of slaves\r\nfrom their native continent, or by a resort to some other source of\r\nample supply. Here, then, was a most violent and persistent effort to\r\nsecure the acknowledgment of a right to do what they had not the means\r\nto accomplish, and what they could not obtain the means of doing without\r\nthe actual overthrow of the Government, as well as a flagrant violation\r\nof the moral sentiments of mankind.\r\n\r\nOn this score, therefore, the account seems to be tolerably well\r\nbalanced; for if Northern men have sometimes wantonly started hostile\r\nand injurious agitation, calculated to arouse fierce passions and to\r\nclose the ears of the Southern people to the voice of reason; these, on\r\nthe other hand, are liable to equal or greater censure for having made\r\nimpossible demands, as unnecessary as they were inadmissible, and liable\r\nfrom their very extravagance to be considered as mere pretexts,\r\ndeliberately adopted with a view to aggravate the quarrel and prevent a\r\nreconciliation. It is difficult to admit any other explanation of the\r\nextraordinary policy of the Southern leaders. It is not improbable that\r\nthey will henceforward acknowledge such to have been the motive of their\r\nprincipal political acts for many years past. The terrible events now\r\npassing before our saddened eyes, are too solemn and weighty, not to be\r\nunderstood in all their past relations and in all their present import.\r\nThey stand forth in stern and awful reality, glaring in the lurid light\r\nof the past and casting dark shadows over the future, while they sweep\r\naway all false pretences, and lay bare the real motives which, from the\r\nbeginning, have actuated the men who are prominent in performing the\r\ngreat drama.\r\n\r\nBut these questions of transient passions and objurgatory provocation\r\nare trivial and unimportant. They do not touch the real causes of the\r\ndifficulty; they are but the froth on the surface of the deep and mighty\r\ncurrent of events, which was rushing on to the gulf of rebellion. The\r\ntime had come, in the history of our country, when, by the necessary\r\nworking of its institutions, the most solemn question of the age was to\r\nbe determined. Slavery must either accept its inevitable doom and\r\nprepare for ultimate extinction, or it must provide new means for\r\nprolonging its existence and reëstablishing its waning power. In three\r\nquarters of a century, the Constitution of 1787 had done its work. It\r\nhad suppressed the immigration of Africans; it had established that of\r\nEuropeans. Free white labor had demonstrated its superiority and\r\nachieved a complete victory over slavery; and the political power, long\r\nwielded by the Southern men, had passed forever out of their hands, as\r\nthe representatives and supporters of the slave policy. In the Senate,\r\nin the House of Representatives, in the great majority of States, in all\r\nthe Territories, and, finally, in the very citadel of their former\r\npower, the presidential mansion, their almost immemorial superiority had\r\nbeen utterly overthrown. The Government was about to assume its true\r\ncharacter, as the home of liberty and the veritable asylum of humanity.\r\nSlavery, fallen into the minority, was about to experience an\r\naccelerated decline and eventually to disappear. To resist this doom,\r\nwas to fight against the Constitution and against destiny.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Southern States were wholly unwilling to accept the\r\ncondition to which the legitimate workings of the Constitution had\r\nfairly brought them. Being a minority in numbers and in representative\r\nweight, they rose up in rebellion against this unalterable fact. They\r\nforesaw it, and, by every possible device, resisted it before it came.\r\nWhen it arrived, they resisted still more madly, even to the extent of\r\nself-destruction. The minority was arrayed not merely against the\r\nmajority, but also against the necessary results of our institutions and\r\nagainst the decrees of nature: that is to say, against the law of man,\r\nand against the law of God. The majority was expected to give way, and\r\nto permit the engine of national progress to be reversed, our eighty\r\nyears of glorious history to be undone, and humanity itself to be turned\r\nback upon the dreary path of its earliest and saddest struggles. This\r\nrefused, the alternative was the destruction of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was wholly impossible for the majority to make any satisfactory\r\nconcessions to a minority infatuated with such ideas. Compromise was\r\nimpracticable, so long as the rebellious States made the perpetuity of\r\nslavery and the predominance of its power an indispensable condition of\r\nany arrangement. Their demands were forever inadmissible so long as they\r\nremained in the Union; and to permit them to effect their purposes as an\r\nindependent confederacy, was equally out of the question. There is no\r\nlonger any division of sentiment on this point, whatever doubts may have\r\nbeen expressed in the beginning. Separation of the States would be\r\ndisastrous and fatal to all the fragmentary governments which would take\r\nthe place of this majestic Union. The nation instinctively feels that\r\nits unity is its salvation--that disunion will be destructive of all its\r\nlong-cherished and glorious hopes. Its permanent peace, its prosperity\r\nand progress, its greatness, its honor, and its influence among\r\ncivilized nations--all depend on its unity. These, which are the glory\r\nof our country to every patriotic heart, were the stumbling blocks to\r\nthe conspirators. Slavery was ambitious and discontented with its\r\nappointed lot; it was determined; it rushed headlong to its fatal\r\npurpose. The nation stood in its path, and would not, could not get out\r\nof the way. This is the central fact of the whole controversy. National\r\nunity is on the one side--the disintegration and anarchy which slavery\r\ndemands, are on the other. These are the contending forces; they are\r\nengaged in mortal combat, and one or the other must be utterly\r\noverthrown and destroyed. Slavery must succumb and consent to disappear,\r\nor the Union of our fathers must go down in the dust, never again to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nCan the enemies of the United States, at home or abroad, suppose that\r\nthese vital questions can ever he yielded? That the nation can\r\nvoluntarily abdicate its authority, confess the failure of its work for\r\nthree quarters of a century; permit all the purposes of its creation to\r\nbe utterly thwarted, and tamely and basely surrender all those hopes of\r\na glorious destiny, which we have ever been taught to cherish as the\r\ngoal of our unexampled freedom? The Southern people have been the sport\r\nof many delusions and infatuations; but the belief of these incredible\r\nand impossible suppositions, is the crowning folly of them all. These\r\nrestless and daring men occupied the fairest region of the globe, with a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the cotton culture. The unexampled increase of the\r\ncotton trade and manufacture, if it had not filled their coffers with\r\nunbounded wealth, had at least given them lavish returns for the labor\r\nof their slaves and enabled them to live in unlimited profusion. That\r\nunder such a system they should have little provident care, but should\r\nindulge unbounded confidence in the future, was natural enough, for they\r\nconceived their prosperity, which cost them so little labor or anxiety,\r\nto be in its nature permanent. When, therefore, they saw gradually\r\napproaching the certain downfall of their power, they could not\r\nunderstand that this was the result of natural causes, but attributed it\r\nto the malignant enmity of the Government. A social organization, so\r\nagreeable, so full of pleasures and advantages, conferring not only ease\r\nand luxury, but also station and authority, must necessarily be right in\r\nitself, and worthy of every effort and every sacrifice to perpetuate it.\r\nWhat was the Government of the United States, that it should presume to\r\nerect itself as an obstacle to the progress of this rich and powerful\r\norganization? Was not the whole fabric of human industry dependent on\r\nit, and would not foreign nations be compelled by the very helplessness\r\nof their starving people to sustain and defend it? Why should there be\r\nanything sacred in the institutions of the country, when they evidently\r\ntended, by their spirit and operation, to overthrow the power of\r\nslavery? Washington was weak, with all his goodness; Jefferson was a\r\ndemagogue; Madison had not forecast enough to see the necessary results\r\nof his political combinations. We have grown wiser; then let us sweep\r\naway the obstacles which were placed in our path by the weakness and\r\nfolly of our deluded forefathers. Let us prostrate the clumsy fabric\r\nwhich they constructed, since the Yankees have taken possession of it,\r\nand are working it for the benefit of Irish and German immigrants and\r\ntheir descendants, and not for that of African traders and negro\r\nmasters. By some terrible fatality, it was the misfortune of the\r\nSouthern leaders to believe these delusions. They have gone so far as to\r\nact upon them, and have seduced their people into fatal coöperation; and\r\nthese are now reaping the bloody fruits of an error so profound and\r\nawful.\r\n\r\nThe rebellious States not only thought it practicable to overthrow the\r\nNational Government; they, doubtless, also held that result necessary to\r\ntheir safety and success. This followed as a logical conclusion from\r\ntheir established dogma that the slavery of the laboring class is the\r\nonly firm foundation of social order. They convinced themselves that\r\nwhite men could not perform the labor necessary on cotton and sugar\r\nplantations. The negro alone was capable of standing the fierce rays of\r\nthe Southern sun, and of successfully resisting the deadly malaria which\r\nprevails in that region. The Southern people firmly believed this\r\ndoctrine, although their very eyes, in all parts of their territory,\r\nexcept perhaps in the rice fields of South Carolina and Georgia,\r\nthousands of white men were and are daily occupied in this very work. So\r\nremarkable a delusion, contradicted by their own daily experience, is by\r\nno means uncommon under similar circumstances. When the passions of men\r\nare aroused and their interests, real or imaginary, involved, they\r\nseldom comprehend the true significance, nor do they stop to estimate\r\ndeliberately the actual conditions, of what is going on around them.\r\nMuch less do they understand the character and tendency of great social\r\nmovements, in which they themselves are actively engaged. The strongest\r\nintellects, in such circumstances, do not often escape the prevailing\r\nprejudices and delusions. A sort of common moral atmosphere pervades the\r\nwhole society; opinions become homogeneous; and even the worst abuses,\r\nsanctioned by time and by universal custom, lose all their enormity, and\r\ncommand the support and approval even of good men. Palpable errors of\r\nfact, and, indeed, every available sophistry in argument, have been\r\nadopted by the Southern men to sustain the system of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe deluded victims of these false ideas could not conceive a different\r\norganization of labor as possible for them. It was perhaps even natural\r\nfor them to consider the opposite system in the Northern States, as\r\nhostile to their interests and dangerous to their peculiar property in\r\nlabor. Nor were they in fact mistaken: not that the Northern social\r\nsystem need have interfered violently to overthrow their institutions;\r\nbut there was an instinctive feeling that the two could not exist\r\ntogether and flourish in the same community. It was obscurely felt that\r\none must give way before the other, whether peacefully or violently, and\r\nit was impossible to doubt which of the two was destined to succumb,\r\nunder the gradual but inevitable operation of our established political\r\nforms and principles. Under the dominion of excited and unreasoning\r\nprejudices, the Southern mind could see no distinction between the\r\nnecessary and irresistible operation of principles and the intentional\r\nhostility of their hated rivals. Thus, with a fixed conviction of the\r\ninevitable end of their system under the Constitution, it was vainly\r\nexpected to avoid that unwelcome fate, by destroying the Government of\r\nthe United States, which had been deliberately created by its founders\r\nwith a view to the ultimate extinction of slavery.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! this expedient has proved to be a fatal error--none more\r\nfatal has ever misled and ruined a prosperous and gallant people.\r\nInstead of overthrowing the Government--a consummation never to be\r\nadmitted or even thought of, with any toleration, for a single\r\nmoment--they will only bring the cherished object of their bloody\r\nsacrifices to a sudden and disastrous end. Slavery never could have\r\nhad--never ought to have had any better security than was afforded by\r\nthe Constitution of this country, administered fairly, as it always has\r\nbeen, if not with evident partiality, toward this exacting interest.\r\nTake away from it the support of the Constitution, and, under any\r\ncircumstances, it would most assuredly fall. But the Government\r\nassaulted, in the interest of slavery, for the increase and perpetuity\r\nof slavery--that presents an emergency which admits of no hesitation,\r\nand in which those who have been most tolerant toward the system, and\r\nmost ready to yield its unreasonable exactions to save the Government,\r\nwill be the first to strike it down for the same end. The nation must\r\nsurvive; its enemies must succumb or perish.\r\n\r\nCan any one deny that the Federal Government was compelled to take up\r\nthe gage of battle which the rebels had so vauntingly thrown down? Not\r\nmerely the interests of civil authority and order, but the preponderance\r\nof freedom, and the claims of humanity on this continent, required the\r\nmost determined resistance to be made, and forbade the possibility of\r\nquietly surrendering the destinies of the nation into the hands of the\r\ntraitors who sought to destroy it, What a spectacle of imbecility and\r\nmiserable failure in the hour of great peril would have been presented\r\nto the indignant world, if, in this great crisis, the national\r\nauthorities had been so far beneath the occasion as to have declined the\r\nproffered contest and basely betrayed their trust, at the first demand\r\nof the seceding States! The everlasting scorn of mankind would have\r\noverwhelmed and blasted the dastard and degenerate race, who would thus\r\nhave sacrificed the highest and most sacred interests of humanity.\r\nRather than this, welcome the civil war, with all its sacrifices!\r\nWelcome privations, labors, taxes, wounds, death, and all the nameless\r\nhorrors that swarm along the red path of civil strife! Thousands of\r\nprecious lives and billions of treasure have already been expended, and\r\nyet no patriotic heart thinks of turning back from the battle field,\r\nuntil the Union established by our fathers shall be restored to its\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nCompelled to admit the conclusions already stated, let us not do\r\ninjustice even to the men who are prominent in this iniquitous\r\nrebellion. The most difficult of all moral problems is to determine how\r\nfar individual agency can control social or political events, and what\r\ndegree of responsibility attaches to those who have been apparently\r\ninfluential in producing disastrous results. An impartial study of\r\nhistory will serve to establish the truth that prominent men who, in any\r\nage, may seem to have produced great changes by their individual will,\r\nwere merely the instruments of society by which irresistible tendencies\r\nwere carried out to their necessary ends. The very conceptions of such\r\nmen are the offspring of their times, and in order that they should have\r\npower to accomplish their designs, the great social forces of the\r\ncommunity must be at their disposal, ready and inclined to perform the\r\nwork. A great rock or a mighty glacier may be so balanced at the\r\nmountain top, that a small force--the sound of a trumpet, a mere breath\r\nof air--may dislodge it, and cause it to descend, carrying destruction\r\ninto the valley. But the force of gravitation is necessary to bring it\r\ndown and give it the impetus of ruin. So the might of a great people may\r\nbe poised on some lofty pinnacle of human destiny; but unless there he\r\ninvolved in the existing sentiments and convictions, the situation and\r\nsurroundings of that people, the elements of force and action, for good\r\nor evil, no individual agency and no combination of men can impart the\r\npower which they lack. All that was required among the Southern people,\r\nfor the initiation of this gigantic rebellion, was some universal\r\nanimating idea, capable of binding them together in unanimous accord,\r\nimparting the necessary force and velocity in the direction of treason,\r\nwhen started and impelled by the efforts of their leading men. Slavery\r\nwas just such a principle; it was the gravitating power which hurled\r\nthem down the precipice, and gave the tremendous impetus of ruin which\r\nthey have exerted in their awful descent. But, in truth, this\r\nmischievous power has been accumulating ever since the Government was\r\nfounded. It grew out of the antecedents of existing society; and the\r\npresent generation is not wholly responsible for it. The misfortunes of\r\nour fathers, their omissions and errors as well as ours, have left this\r\nfatal legacy to descend into our hands. We may not have dealt with it\r\nwisely, but assuredly the framers of the Constitution did not intend\r\nslavery to be perpetual, nor did they provide for it the power to\r\noverthrow the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON GUARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n   In the black terror-night,\r\n     On yon mist-shrouded hill,\r\n   Slowly, with footstep light,\r\n     Stealthy, and grim, and still,\r\n   Like ghost in winding sheet\r\n     Risen at midnight bell,\r\n   Over his lonely beat\r\n     Marches the sentinel!\r\n\r\n   In storm-defying cloak--\r\n     Hand on his trusty gun--\r\n   Heart, like a heart of oak--\r\n     Eye, never-setting sun;\r\n   Speaks but the challenge-shout,\r\n     All foes without the line,\r\n   Heeds but, to solve the doubt,\r\n     Watchword and countersign.\r\n\r\n   Camp-ward, the watchfires gleam\r\n     Beacon-like in the gloom;\r\n   Round them his comrades dream\r\n     Pictures of youth and home.\r\n   While in his heart the bright\r\n     Hope-fires shine everywhere,\r\n   In love's enchanting light\r\n     Memory lies dreaming there.\r\n\r\n   Faint, through the silence come\r\n     From the foes' grim array,\r\n   Growl of impatient dram\r\n     Eager for morrow's fray;\r\n   Echo of song and shout,\r\n    Curse and carousal glee,\r\n   As in a fiendish rout\r\n    Demons at revelry.\r\n\r\n   Close, in the gloomy shade--\r\n    Danger lurks ever nigh--\r\n   Grasping his dagger-blade\r\n    Crouches th' assassin spy;\r\n   Shrinks at the guardman's tread,\r\n    Quails 'fore his gleaming eyes,\r\n   Creeps back with baffled hate,\r\n    Cursing his cowardice.\r\n\r\n   Naught can beguile his bold\r\n     Unsleeping vigilance;\r\n   E'en in the fireflame, old\r\n     Visions unheeded dance.\r\n   Fearless of lurking spy,\r\n     Scornful of wassail-swell,\r\n   With an undaunted eye\r\n     Marches the sentinel.\r\n\r\n   Low, to his trusty gun\r\n     Eagerly whispers he,\r\n   'Wait, with the morning sun\r\n     March we to victory.\r\n   Fools, into Satan's clutch\r\n     Leaping ere dawn of day:\r\n   He who would fight must watch,\r\n     He who would win must pray.'\r\n\r\n   Pray! for the night hath wings;\r\n     Watch! for the foe is near;\r\n   March! till the morning brings\r\n     Fame-wreath or soldier's bier.\r\n   So shall the poet write,\r\n     When all hath ended well,\r\n   'Thus through the nation's night\r\n     Marched Freedom's sentinel.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a fair, sunny morning in July, 1862, I started from--no matter where;\r\nand taking my seat in a comfortable rail car, turned my face toward the\r\nborders of Vermont.\r\n\r\nAs the road, for the greater part of the way was an up-grade, and as\r\nthere is on that particular route a way station about every two miles,\r\nat each of which the cars unduly stop, our progress was rather slow, and\r\nI had ample time to observe alike the wild and rugged scenery through\r\nwhich we were passing, and the countenances and actions of my fellow\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nFor a time the picturesque character of country engaged my attention;\r\nbut getting tired, at last, of the endless succession of green\r\nmountains, clothed to their summits with dark pine and hemlock; of\r\nrocky, tortuous streams, their channels run almost dry by the excessive\r\ndrought; of stony fields, dotted with sheep or sprinkled with diminutive\r\nhay cocks, or coaxed by patient cultivation into bearing a few hills of\r\nstunted Indian corn, I began to find the interior of the car a much more\r\ninteresting field of observation. And it is wonderful how many different\r\naspects of human nature one can see in the course of a day's journey in\r\na railroad car.\r\n\r\nThe first person who attracted my notice, was a young man sitting\r\nopposite to me. His appearance was prepossessing, not so much from\r\nbeauty of form or feature, as from the pleasant expression of his fair,\r\nopen face, adorned with side whiskers of a reddish hue, of the\r\n_mutton-chop_ genus and _pendent_ species. He looked like an Englishman\r\nor Anglicized Scotchman; but from some words he let drop, I am inclined\r\nto believe he was a Western man. Be that as it may, he was evidently a\r\ntourist, travelling for pleasure through a country that was new to him,\r\nand desirous of gaining all the information he could concerning it.\r\n\r\nOn the hooks above him, hung a heavy blanket shawl, an umbrella, and a\r\nlittle basket. In his hand he held one of Appleton's Railway Guides,' to\r\nwhich he made constant reference, reading from it the names of the\r\nplaces through which we passed, in tones so loud and distinct, that most\r\nof his fellow passengers participated in the information. On the seat\r\nbeside him lay a large book in red binding, which proved to be another\r\nguide book, and to which he referred when the smaller one failed him.\r\nImmediately behind him sat a saturnine-looking gentleman (also provided\r\nwith a railway guide), with whom he frequently conversed, addressing him\r\nas 'John,' and who seemed to be his travelling companion.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to feel interested in the movements of the\r\ntourist. To gentlemanly manners and an air of refinement, there was\r\nadded a certain boyish simplicity that was quite refreshing to\r\ncontemplate. He seemed to fraternize with everybody, conversing freely,\r\nfirst with one passenger, then with another; and apparently imparting to\r\nall a portion of the genial good humor with which his nature was\r\nflooded.\r\n\r\nI was amused with a colloquy that took place, in regard to a field of\r\nripening grain, near which the train had stopped.\r\n\r\n'Is that a field of wheat?' asked 'John' of his friend.\r\n\r\n'Well, really,' said the tourist, ingenuously, 'I don't know the\r\ndifference between wheat and rye.' Then bending toward the person who\r\nsat in front of him, he said, in an earnest manner, 'Pray, sir, can you\r\ntell me whether that field is wheat or rye?'\r\n\r\nThe other glanced at the field rather dubiously, I thought; but answered\r\npromptly:\r\n\r\n'That's wheat, sir.'\r\n\r\nIt was rye, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nI observed that the tourist had, by affability, completely won the heart\r\nof the conductor. Whenever that official was at liberty--which, by the\r\nway, was only for a few minutes at a time, in of the numerous stopping\r\nplaces--he would sit down until the scream of the whistle summoned him\r\nagain to his duty, when he would hurry through his task, again to his\r\nfavorite seat.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was much struck with the large quantities of wild\r\nraspberries, that clothed the fences on either side of the track. 'There\r\nwere no raspberries,' he said, 'where he came from. At the very next\r\nstation I saw the conductor go out (although it was now raining), break\r\noff a branch, loaded with ripe fruit, from a raspberry bush, and\r\nreturning to the car, smilingly present it to his friend. The gentleman\r\nthanked him warmly; but instead of selfishly devouring the fruit\r\nhimself, generously shared it with all within reach of his arm, with a\r\ndiffusive benevolence that put me in mind of the free-hearted Irishman,\r\nwho, as he gave his friend the half of his potato, said: 'You're welcome\r\nto it, if 'twere _twice as little_.'\r\n\r\nAt another place the tourist himself got out, and returned with a\r\nhandful of wayside flowers. Selecting from them a fine, blooming clover\r\nhead, and a little weed of the bulrush family, he placed them between\r\nthe leaves of his guide book, saying to his neighbor, as he did so:\r\n\r\n'I like to preserve such little mementoes of the places I visit. Once,\r\nwhen travelling at the South, I gathered a cotton bud; and would you\r\nbelieve it, in the course of three months it expanded to a perfect\r\nflower, and actually ripened its seeds?'\r\n\r\n'Why, then,' said the other, laughingly, 'we need be at no loss for\r\ncotton, if it can be cultivated as easily as that.'\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to this passenger, was another, who sat a few seats\r\nin front of him. His appearance was _not_ prepossessing, on the\r\ncontrary, 'quite the reverse.' He was a coarse, heavy-looking,\r\nthick-set, dirty, Irish soldier, redolent of whiskey and tobacco. His\r\nlooks inspired me with profound disgust and dislike, which were not at\r\nall lessened when I saw him take from the hands of a comrade a black\r\nbottle, and applying it to his lips, solace himself with a 'dhrop of the\r\ncratur.'\r\n\r\nBut I found, ere long, that there was a heart beneath that dirty\r\nuniform, a soft kernel inside of the rude, unpromising husk. His family\r\nwere on the car; and as he sat in a lounging attitude, conversing with\r\nhis comrade (they had both been discharged, I heard them say, from the\r\n'6th New York'), a little girl came staggering along the passage way,\r\nholding herself up by the seats on either side. As she neared him, she\r\nsprang to him, and placed herself between his knees; and the coarse,\r\nweather-beaten face beamed down upon her with _such_ a smile--so full of\r\nwarm, tender, earnest affection, that I felt rebuked for my previous\r\npoor opinion of that man.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. At C----, the little girl, accompanied by her mother\r\nand several brothers and sisters, got out; while the soldier himself,\r\nhaving seen them all safely deposited on the station platform, and\r\ntreated them to a hearty smack all round, returned to the car, and\r\nresumed his seat. As the train began to move, he started up, thrust his\r\nhead out of the window, and greeted the group on the platform with\r\nanother of those bright, loving smiles, that made my heart warm to the\r\nrough, sun-burnt soldier, in spite of tobacco, and whiskey, and dirt.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we reached the pretty village of Rutland, Vt.; and there the\r\nstentorian voice of the conductor rang out:\r\n\r\n'Passengers for Boston, change cars!'\r\n\r\nI hastened to obey the mandate; and the last I saw of the genial-hearted\r\ntourist (who was going to Montreal), he was shaking hands with his\r\nfriend the conductor, whose 'beat' extended no further; and bidding him\r\na warm and hearty 'good-by.'\r\n\r\nIn the car in which I now found myself, no talkative tourist or\r\ncompanionable conductor enlivened the way; a much more 'still-life'\r\norder of things prevailed. But here, too, I soon found objects of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nNear me sat a young officer in undress uniform, with a cicatrized bullet\r\nwound in his cheek. He had doubtless been home on 'sick leave,' and,\r\nthough now quite restored to health, was apparently in no hurry to go\r\nback. Far from it. Very different thoughts, I fancy, occupied his mind\r\nthan cutting rebel throats, or acquiring distinction in the 'imminent\r\ndeadly breach.' There was a lady by his side, with whom, judging by\r\nappearances, his relations were of an extremely tender character. They\r\nwere either newly married, or about soon to 'undergo the operation.' I\r\nincline to the latter belief; for in reply to a remark from the lady\r\nthat they would be late in arriving at their destination, I overheard\r\nthe gentleman smilingly say:\r\n\r\n'Well, at all events, nothing can be done until _we_ get there.'\r\n\r\nAnd here, in passing, I would respectfully suggest to all couples in the\r\npeculiarly interesting position of my young fellow travellers, that a\r\nrailroad car is not the most suitable place in the world, in which to\r\nlavish endearments on each other. However delightful the 'exercise' may\r\nbe to them, truth compels me to say that it is, to cool, uninterested,\r\ndispassionate lookers-on, decidedly nauseating.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am writing, the War order, recalling all\r\nstragglers, had not been promulgated; and no one, in travelling, could\r\nfail to be struck with the predominance of the military element among\r\nthe population. It was unpleasant to observe, at every railroad station,\r\nat every wayside grocery store, groups of idle, lounging soldiers,\r\nsmoking and gossiping, and having, apparently, no earthly object except\r\nto kill time; and to know that these men, wearing their country's\r\nuniform, and drawing their pay from her exhausted exchequer, were\r\nlingering at home on various pretexts, and basely and deliberately\r\nshirking their duty, while rebellion still reared its horrid front, and\r\nthe Government required every arm that could be raised in its defence.\r\nThat energetic document put a stop to all this; but the question here\r\narises, Can the men be in earnest? Can that patriotism be genuine which\r\nneeds to be driven to the battle field?\r\n\r\nAh! here is one brave fellow, who, though still lame from a recent\r\nwound, is hastening back to the scenes where duty calls him. He comes\r\ninto the cars with his sword in one hand, and his overcoat, neatly\r\nstrapped, in the other. He looks grave and serious--doubtless he is\r\nthinking of home, and of the dear ones he has just left. Doubtless, from\r\nthat cause springs a singular restlessness, that impels him to get out\r\nat every stopping place, and pace backward and forward with unequal\r\nsteps, till the train starts again. As he passes and repasses me, I try\r\nto read his countenance. There is no flinching there--no shrinking from\r\nduty in that brave soul. In the expressive language of Scripture, he has\r\n'put his life in his hand,' and is ready to offer it at the shrine of\r\nhis country. As I mark his firm lip, his thoughtful eye, his look of\r\nsteadfast determination, there come into my mind those grand\r\nsoul-stirring lines of Percival:\r\n\r\n   'Oh! it is great for our country to die; when ranks are contending,\r\n     Bright is the wreath of our fame; glory awaits us for aye:\r\n   Glory, that never is dim, shining on with a light never ending,\r\n     Glory, that never shall fade, never, O never, away.'\r\n\r\nAt the first station beyond Rutland, a woman with a baby--there is\r\nalways a woman with a baby in the cars--got out. In addition to the\r\nbaby, she had a carpet bag, a band box, a basket, and several paper\r\nparcels. How she managed to carry them all, I know not; but as she was\r\nstumbling along, thus overloaded, a lady, just entering the car with\r\nsome others, with a sudden, generous impulse, took the baby in her arms,\r\nand, at the risk of losing her own passage, carried it to the door of\r\nthe waiting-room. Then, without stopping to receive the thanks of the\r\ngrateful mother, she rejoined her friends, smiling at her own exploit,\r\nand all unconscious of the admiration her beautiful action had excited\r\nin some of her fellow travellers. At the picturesque village of Bellow's\r\nFalls, on the Connecticut river, we entered the 'Old Granite State,' but\r\ntoo far south to see the 'native mountains' in their wildest grandeur\r\nand magnificence. One specimen, however, greets us as we leave the\r\nvillage--a huge, perpendicular mass of granite, rising sheer up from the\r\nrailroad to the height of a thousand feet or more; while the river, a\r\nwild receptacle of tumbled rocks and broken falls, stretches along the\r\nother side of the track, far beneath us. The labor expended in the\r\nconstruction of this mountain road (the Cheshire Railroad) must have\r\nbeen enormous, and affords a striking proof of the indomitable energy\r\nand enterprise of the New England character. The high places have\r\nliterally been brought low, and the valleys exalted. Not once, but many\r\ntimes, the train rushes through between two perpendicular walls of solid\r\ngranite, so high that not a glimpse of the sky can be seen from the car\r\nwindows; while beyond, some hollow chasm or rugged gulley has been\r\nbridged over, or filled up with the superabundant masses of stone\r\nexcavated from the deep cuts.\r\n\r\nIt gives one a feeling of dizzy exaltation to be whirled, at the rate of\r\nthirty or forty miles an hour--for as there is for a good part of the\r\nway a descending grade, the velocity is tremendous--along the verge of a\r\nmountain, and to see other mountains, with valleys, rivers, villages,\r\nand church steeples, spread out beneath you, as if on a map. But\r\ngradually the face of the country changes; the mountains become less\r\nlofty, the granite formations disappear; here stretches a wide, dismal\r\npond of stagnant water, yellow with water lilies (_Nuphar_), and there a\r\nfield that has been burnt over, leaving the scorched and branchless\r\ntrees standing like a host of hideous spectres, until at last the\r\nfertile and highly cultivated fields of Massachusetts smile upon us with\r\na pleasant, cheerful aspect.\r\n\r\nBut, pleasing as it is to contemplate well-cultivated farms and thriving\r\nhomesteads, it must be confessed that to the eye of the traveller wild\r\nmountain scenery has a far stronger attraction; and insensibly, as the\r\ntrain speeds on through the now level country, veiled in a thin,\r\ndrizzling, mist-like rain, I find my gaze and my thoughts coming back\r\nfrom the outside world, and resting once more on my co-inmates of the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nNot far from me sits a beautiful young girl, fair haired and blue eyed,\r\nand of a peculiarly interesting and lady-like appearance. She has a look\r\nof bright intelligence; and on her lap lies a book, the title of which I\r\ncan read from here: 'English Literature.' But she is deaf and dumb, as\r\nis plainly betokened by the rapid, chirological conversation going on\r\nbetween her and a young man, evidently her brother, who sits beside her.\r\nBehind them is seated an elderly lady, who seems to have charge of her,\r\nand with whom she occasionally converses in writing.\r\n\r\nThe young man is not, like her, deprived of the organs of speech; but\r\nhis proficiency in the finger-language is perfectly marvellous. It\r\nsurpasses even her own in rapidity of movement and graceful ease. It is\r\nmost interesting to watch them, as, their eyes glancing from hand to\r\nface, they carry on their silent conversation; the dumb girl\r\noccasionally bursting into a hearty laugh, at some remark of her\r\ncompanion. Nothing could exceed the devoted and tender attention of the\r\nbrother. Whenever any object worthy of notice in the scenery presented\r\nitself, he would touch her lightly on the shoulder to attract attention,\r\nand then with a few rapid movements of his fingers, direct her eyes to\r\nit, and give an explanation of it. If she required refreshment, he\r\nwould hurry from the car, and hurry back again, with art anxious, eager\r\nlook, as if he feared something might have befallen her in his absence.\r\nShe seemed to repose implicit confidence in him; and well was he worthy\r\nof it. Heaven's blessing rest upon you, noble young man! for your\r\nearnest devotion to that afflicted one.\r\n\r\nAt one place, where the cars stopped, I witnessed an affecting scene--a\r\nsoldier parting from his children. Two young girls, the one about\r\nfifteen, the other some years younger, stood in the door of the station\r\nroom, their faces swoln and discolored with weeping. Their mother, pale\r\nand sad, stood near them; while the father, a fine looking,\r\nstrongly-built man of forty, in the uniform of an artilleryman, went\r\nforward to see to the stowage of his knapsack and other 'traps.'\r\n\r\nThe eldest girl had succeeded in subduing her grief into 'a kind of\r\nquiet;' but the younger--poor thing! how my heart bled to see her! She\r\ndid not sob, or cry out; but every muscle of her face quivered with\r\nirrepressible emotion, and her trembling limbs seemed scarcely able to\r\nsupport her. There was more than the sorrow of parting there; there was\r\nof ever seeing her father again. Her sister tried to soothe hers. Her\r\nmother spoke sharply to her; then, with true maternal instinct, went\r\nforward to the baggage car, and brought her father back to her. The\r\nmother herself did not shed a tear; but _her_ parting time had not come,\r\nfor she was to accompany her husband on his journey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father!\" sobbed the poor girl; and that was all she could say, as\r\nshe flung her arms around his neck, and clung to him with a convulsive\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her soothingly, reasoned with her, sought to calm her; but,\r\nin the midst of his tender offices, the inexorable whistle sounded; and\r\ntearing himself from her embrace, he sprang into the cars, accompanied\r\nby his wife, and took a seat just in front of me. Something rose in my\r\nthroat as I looked at them, and the unbidden tears sprang to my eyes.\r\nThe man's fine, expressive countenance, sun-burnt and heavily bearded,\r\ngrave yet calm, gave evidence of the suffering the past scene had cost\r\nhim. But the face of the woman was a study. She was evidently determined\r\nnot to weep. She was resolved, by at least an outward cheerfulness, to\r\nsustain her husband in his noble self-sacrificing patriotism. How it\r\nwould be when her own parting hour arrived, heaven knows; but then the\r\nthought of _that_ was resolutely driven away. As we rode along, they\r\nconversed much together, and I saw her more than once in calling back a\r\nsmile to the grave, sad face of her husband.\r\n\r\nBrave man! tearing asunder your heart's dearest chords, to deliver your\r\ncountry from the parricidal stroke of fierce rebellion. Brave woman!\r\nconcealing with Spartan fortitude the sorrow in your heart, that your\r\ngallant husband may be strengthened in his noble aim--shall these things\r\nbe done and suffered in vain? No, no; believe it not. The clouds may\r\ngather, reverses may come, but of this be well assured: The right _will_\r\ntriumph!\r\n\r\nToward the latter part of my journey, the monotony of the scene was\r\nenlivened by a row in the cars. Cause--a woman.\r\n\r\nDuring our short pause in the city of P., two men, who had been seated\r\ntogether, went out, leaving some of their travelling gear on the seat.\r\nWhile they absent, a lady, accompanied by a little boy, entered the car;\r\nand, contrary to the etiquette of railroad travel, displaced their\r\nbaggage, and took possession of the seat. She was a rather\r\ncoarse-looking woman of about thirty; richly but not very appropriately\r\nattired, in a handsome black silk dress, with a sacque or outer garment\r\nof the same material, reaching almost to her feet. Her jet black hair\r\nhang in thick, short curls all around her head, and was surmounted by\r\none of those little round hats, familiarly known as 'jockeys,' which\r\nare so pretty and becoming on young girls, so hideous on elderly women.\r\n\r\nVery soon, the two men came in, and claimed their seat. But the lady\r\nrefused to move. My attention was first directed to them by hearing one\r\nof the men exclaim, in loud and angry tones:\r\n\r\n'It's no use talking. _Your_ business, ma'am, is to _get out!_'\r\n\r\nBut an image carved in ebony could not have been more immovable than the\r\nlady in the black silk dress.\r\n\r\nIn vain the aggrieved gentlemen represented to her that the seat was\r\ntheirs, that their baggage was there, that she had no right to take it,\r\netc.; she paid no attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe cars started; and the two men, there being no seat vacant, stood\r\nover her, with wrath and defiance in their looks, waiting in grim\r\nsilence until she should comply with their request. But she gave no sign\r\nof compliance.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the conductor made his appearance. To him they excitedly\r\nstated their grievance, but received, apparently, no redress.\r\n\r\nSome time had elapsed, and I had forgotten the circumstance, when my\r\nattention was suddenly aroused by seeing one of the men, now worked up\r\ninto an ungovernable passion, seize the lady by the shoulder, and\r\nattempt to put her out by force. In a moment all was uproar and\r\nconfusion. The lady screamed. The little boy roared with fright. Every\r\nman in the car started to his feet, and loud cries of 'Put him out!'\r\n'Knock him down!' 'Shame! shame! to touch a woman!' resounded on every\r\nside. Half a dozen rough hands seized the man by the collar and arms,\r\nand amid the most indescribable noise and tumult, he was unceremoniously\r\nhustled out of the car.\r\n\r\nThe lady seemed to regard herself as a martyr. I heard her excitedly\r\nnarrating her wrongs to one of her neighbors, finishing off with:\r\n\r\n'I was never treated so before; never! never!'\r\n\r\n'H'm!' said the person addressed, as if not quite coinciding with her\r\nviews of the case.\r\n\r\nAn elderly man, who sat beside me, and whose appearance and manners\r\nplainly indicated his title to\r\n\r\n   'The grand old name of gentleman,'\r\n\r\nhad started to his feet with the rest, but having been out when the\r\naffair commenced, was unable to comprehend what the row was about. As he\r\nturned to me with a bewildered and inquiring look, I explained to him\r\nthe cause of the trouble, at the same time expressing my opinion that\r\nthe man had been unjustly thrust out, and that the lady was entirely to\r\nblame.\r\n\r\n'Certainly she was,' said he, with emphasis, 'but the conductor was\r\nstill more so. He ought to have given the men their seat, and found\r\nanother for the lady.' Then glancing contemptuously at her, the old\r\ngentleman said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, she's no lady--she's some common person--no _lady_ would behave in\r\nthat manner.'\r\n\r\nAs I was more than half of the old gentleman's opinion, I did not\r\ngainsay him. After a pause, he continued, with a self-complacency that\r\namused me:\r\n\r\n'Ah, I am a pretty good judge of women; and I don't believe that any\r\n_lady_ would travel with _a thing like that_ on her head. No, no; she's\r\nsome common person, depend upon it.'\r\n\r\nIt was evident to me that the old gentleman felt very strongly on the\r\nsubject of 'jockeys;' for, not content with this sweeping thrust, he\r\nshortly afterward renewed the subject. It happened that in this\r\nparticular car there was an appendage affixed to the back of each seat,\r\nfor the purpose of adding to the comfort of passengers, but which\r\nsignally failed of that end, as far as the bonnet-wearing part of the\r\ncommunity was concerned. As I was much incommoded by it, I requested the\r\nold gentleman to turn it down for me. As he did so, he glanced again at\r\nour neighbor in the black silk dress, who had taken off her 'jockey,'\r\nand was comfortably reposing her raven locks on the aforesaid\r\nappendage, and said, jocularly:\r\n\r\n'Now, if you would wear such a thing as _that_, you could take it off,\r\nand be quite comfortable.'\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed, quietly but heartily, at what he evidently considered\r\nthe preposterousness of such an idea.\r\n\r\n'Why is it,' continued the old gentleman, who was evidently a\r\nphilosopher, 'why is it that women must all dress exactly alike? Why\r\ncan't they dress to suit themselves, as men do? Now just look around\r\nthis crowded car--no two men have the same kind of head-covering,' It\r\nwas true; there were hats of every shape and hue; hats of felt, hats of\r\nbeaver, hats of straw, caps, military and civil--an endless variety.\r\n'But the womens' bonnets,' added he, 'are all just alike in shape.'\r\n\r\n'No, there are some exceptions,' said I, with a sly glance at the owner\r\nof the jockey.' On which the old gentleman laughed again, and was about\r\nto reply; when arrival of the train at its destination brought our\r\nconversation to a sudden stop, and the motley assemblage, whether\r\ncrowned with hat or cap, bonnet or 'jockey,' parted company, never to\r\nmeet again on this side of the Dark River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBSTACLES TO PEACE.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO AN ENGLISH FRIEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have your late letter inquiring, as did several of its\r\npredecessors, how soon this terrible Civil War is to end, and why we do\r\nnot close it at once by consenting to Disunion. These inquiries are\r\nnatural from your point of view; I have briefly answered them already;\r\nbut the subject is of vast importance, and we have good reason for our\r\ndesire that correct views respecting it should prevail among the\r\nenlightened and just in Europe. We feel that we are entitled to the\r\nearnest and active sympathy of such men as you are in every country and\r\nof every creed. We feel that we have unjustly, by artful\r\nmisrepresentations, been deprived of this, and that we have suffered\r\ngrievously in consequence. Let me endeavor, then, to restate our\r\nposition somewhat more fully, and to show wherein and why we impeach the\r\njustice of the criticisms to which we have been subjected even by humane\r\nand fair-minded Englishmen.\r\n\r\nI need not, at this late day, prove to you that Slavery is the animating\r\nsoul of the Rebellion. The fact that no compromise or adjustment of the\r\nquarrel was proposed from any quarter during the inception and progress\r\nof Secession, which did not relate directly and exclusively to Slavery,\r\nis conclusive on this point. Projects for arresting the impending\r\ncalamity were abundant throughout the winter of 1860-61. Congress was\r\ngorged with them; a volunteer 'Peace Congress' was simultaneously held\r\non purpose to arrest the dreaded disruption, and attended by able\r\nDelegations from all the Border Slave and most of the Free States, many\r\nof the former now fighting in the Rebel ranks; but no one suggested that\r\nany conceivable legislation on any subject but Slavery was desired or\r\nwould be of the least avail. Mr. Alexander H. Stephens, the\r\nVice-President of the Southern Confederacy, and, perhaps, the ablest man\r\nin it, who resisted Secession until overborne and carried away by the\r\nswelling tide, in his first elaborate speech justifying the movement,\r\nably and candidly set forth the natural fitness, justice, humanity,\r\nbeneficence, and perpetuity of Slavery as the corner-stone of the new\r\nNational edifice. The 'Peace Convention' presented the Crittenden\r\nCompromise,--that is, the positive establishment by act of Congress of\r\nSlavery in all present and future Territories of the United States,\r\nsouth of the parallel of 36° 30' north latitude--as its sole panacea for\r\nour national ills. Nobody suggested in that Congress or any similar\r\nconference that a permanent abolition of all duties on imports, or any\r\nother measure unrelated to slavery, would be of the least use in\r\nreclaiming the States which had seceded, or in arresting the secession\r\nof others. The sole pretext for the Rebellion was and is that the Free\r\nStates had not been faithful in spirit and letter to their\r\nconstitutional obligations respecting Slavery, and could not be trusted\r\nto do better in the future than they had done in the past. We are\r\ninvolved in deadly war precisely and only because the Free States,\r\nthrough the action at the ballot-box of a majority of their citizens,\r\nrefused to coöperate in or make themselves a voluntary party to the\r\nfurther extension or diffusion of Human Slavery.\r\n\r\nBearing this fact in mind, I think you will more readily realize the\r\nmoral impossibility of our assent, save under the impulse of a last dire\r\nnecessity, to a Disunion Peace, and for these reasons:\r\n\r\nI. Such a peace will naturally secure to Slavery the precise object, for\r\nwhich the Rebellion was fomented. If we consent to divide our country,\r\nthe victorious Rebels will very fairly say, 'Give us our share of the\r\nFederal Territories.' In other words, 'Surrender to Slavery, through\r\nDisunion, the very thing which you refused to concede to it to prevent\r\nDisunion.' And that demand, if we concede the right and the fact of\r\nSecession, can with difficulty be resisted. Yet its concession involves\r\nthe moral certainty that Mexico and Cuba will in time be overrun,\r\nconquered, absorbed, and devoted to Slavery, by the martial, aggressive,\r\nambitious despotism to 'which we shall have succumbed. Read Prof.\r\nCairnes's recent essay on 'The Slave Power,' and you will have a clearer\r\nidea of the wolf we now hold by the ears, and which is far less\r\ndangerous while so held than he must be if let go.\r\n\r\nII. The boundary which Secession proffers is an unnatural and impossible\r\none. It not only alienates from the Union Western Texas, East Tennessee,\r\nand other regions wherein a majority have ever been and still are\r\ndevoted to the old flag, but insists on wresting from us West\r\nVirginia--that is, that portion of the old State of Virginia which\r\nslopes toward the Ohio river--a region larger in area than three of the\r\nStates left in the Union put together--a region which, never having been\r\npractically slaveholding save to a very limited extent, has ever been\r\npreponderately and earnestly loyal--a region mainly held to-day, as it\r\nhas almost uniformly been held, by the Unionists--a region which, if\r\nsurrendered to the Confederacy, interposes a wedge of foreign territory\r\nbetween Pennsylvania and Ohio, the East and the West--leaving them\r\nconnected by a shred (see map) not one hundred miles broad, and\r\nrendering a farther and more fatal disruption of the Union wellnigh\r\ninevitable. When the Baltimore and Ohio railroad shall traverse for the\r\nmost part a foreign country--when the Mississippi, through all the lower\r\npart of its course, shall have been surrendered by us to a power\r\ninevitably hostile to our growth and jealous of our prosperity--when\r\nWheeling and Memphis shall have become foreign ports, and Cincinnati and\r\nSt. Louis frontier cities--the gravitation of the Free West toward the\r\ncountry to which her rivers are hastening and through which her bulky\r\nstaples find their natural outlet to the great highway of nations, will\r\nbe all but irresistible.\r\n\r\nIII. And this brings me to a vital point, which Europeans have seemed\r\ndetermined not to comprehend--that of the extremely artificial and\r\nfragile character of the political structure which our architects of\r\nnational ruin are laboring to construct. Mr. Chancellor Gladstone is\r\npleased to favor us with his opinion that Slavery cannot long survive\r\nthe recognition and perfect establishment of the Southern Confederacy. I\r\nbeg leave to assure him, in turn, that the Confederacy would not long\r\nsurvive the downfall of Slavery. Let Slavery fall, and a million of\r\nbayonets could not keep the North and South disunited even twenty years.\r\nApart from Slavery and its fancied necessities, there is not a\r\nDisunionist between New Brunswick and Mexico, Canada and Cuba. The Union\r\nis the darling of our affections, the seal of our security, the\r\npalladium of our strength. No American ever tolerated the idea of\r\ndisunion except as he intensely loved or hated Slavery, and regarded the\r\nUnion as an obstacle to the realization of his wishes respecting it.\r\nWere Slavery universal and supreme among us, or were it abolished and\r\nits influence effaced, you could find more Thugs in Scotland than\r\nDisunionists in America.\r\n\r\nIV. And here your statesmen are making a mistake which some of them will\r\nlive to realize and rue. They suppose that our country, once fairly\r\ndivided and arrayed under two hostile governments, recognizing and no\r\nlonger at war with each other, must ever thereafter _remain_ divided.\r\nThey never reckoned more wildly. Were their wishes fully realized this\r\nday, and the Confederacy an undisputed fact, a party would instantly\r\narise--nay, a party already exists--throughout the country, demanding\r\nreunion on any terms. Archbishop Hughes has already in either hemisphere\r\nstruck the keynote of this cry. He truly says that our country cannot be\r\npermanently divided. He unworthily adds that, if it cannot be united\r\nunder the old Constitution, it must be under a new one--in other words,\r\nunder that of the Confederacy. The Democratic party of the Free States,\r\nabandoning the creed of its founders, which has lately ruled the Union\r\nby virtue of a close alliance with the Slave Power of the South,--would,\r\nthe day after we had made peace by acknowledging the Southern\r\nConfederacy, reorganize and reagitate under the banner of\r\n'Reconstruction.' Hatred to negroes is the talisman whereby it secures\r\nthe votes by pandering to the prejudices of the most ignorant and\r\nvicious Whites--by hostility to negro immigration (from the South),\r\nnegro suffrage, negro competition in the labor market, and to negro\r\nhumanity in general. That Slavery is the natural and fit condition of\r\nnegroes everywhere and at all times--that the abolition of Southern\r\nSlavery would be a great calamity to the white laborers of the\r\nNorth--such is the political philosophy assiduously dispensed and\r\ngreedily imbibed in the grogshops and 'back slums' of every Northern\r\ncity, and which politicians and journalists pretending to sense and\r\ndecency do not hesitate for their party's and their ambition's sake to\r\nindorse and disseminate. And there are clashes less debased, though\r\nscarcely more heartless, who countenance this inhuman logic. The average\r\nmercantile sentiment of this and other great Northern cities runs thus:\r\n'True, Slavery is unjust and barbarous--it is at once a wrong and a\r\nmistake--but it is not _our_ blunder. Its perils are braved and its\r\nevils endured by those who cherish it, hundreds of miles away; while _to\r\nus_ it is a positive advantage. By obstructing the mechanical and\r\nmanufacturing development of the South, it dooms her products, her\r\ncommerce, her navigation, to build up Northern marts and factories; by\r\nits restriction of Southern industry mainly to the plantation, it opens\r\nbroad avenues for the disposal of our wares. The sin and the sorrow are\r\nmonopolized by the South: the gain and the good enure to the North.' How\r\nshort-sighted and fallacious is this calculation, I need not here\r\ndemonstrate: suffice it that it is very generally made, and that the\r\nresult is not merely a general mercantile callousness to the iniquities\r\nof the slave-holding system, but a current sentiment which regards it\r\nwith active and positive favor.\r\n\r\nV. Disunion being an accepted fact, and peace restored on that basis,\r\nthe Republican party, which has ineffectually resisted the aggressions\r\nof the Slave Power and directed the national effort to maintain and\r\npreserve the Union, is beaten and prostrate. The Democratic party\r\nrallies under the banner of 'Reunion at any price.' What price will be\r\naccepted? Simply and obviously, _Adoption of the Montgomery\r\nConstitution, and application for admission under it into the Southern\r\nConfederacy_. True, that Constitution inexorably prescribes that\r\n\r\n     'The citizens of each State shall have the right of transit and\r\n     sojourn in any State of this Confederacy with their slaves and\r\n     other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not\r\n     thereby be impaired.'\r\n\r\n'Sojourn in any State,' you perceive--'not for a day, but for all time.'\r\nThat clause alone makes Slavery universal and imperative throughout the\r\nConfederacy, and no State can evade or override it. But again:\r\n\r\n     'The Confederate States may acquire new territory * * * * in all\r\n     such territory, negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate\r\n     States, shall be recognised and protected by Congress and by the\r\n     territorial government; and the inhabitants of the Confederate\r\n     States and Territories shall have the right to take to such\r\n     territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or\r\n     Territories of the Confederate States.'\r\n\r\nThere are more provisions like these; but they are not needed to make\r\nevery State that adheres to the Confederacy a Slave State, and every\r\nfoot of territory which may be conceded to or acquired by it, slave\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nTo abasement at the footstool of this triumphant wickedness, everything\r\nvenal and sordid in the yet Free States would inevitably and intensely\r\ngravitate: commerce seeking customers; manufactures eager for markets;\r\nshipping greedy of cargoes and freights; but, above all, Democratic\r\npoliticians hungry for power and pelf, and having the strong instinct of\r\nAmerican unity and nationality as their fulcrum. They would gradually\r\nbut surely undermine the mutilated fabric of our once glorious Union,\r\nand tear away its pillars to strengthen and extend the pile whereof\r\nSlavery is the acknowledged corner-stone. The Union would gradually\r\ncrumble and disappear, and the slaveholders' Confederacy be built up\r\nfrom its ruins; the Slave Power would resume its arrested march toward\r\nthe equator, dragging the Republic behind its triumphal chariot wheels;\r\nMexico, Central America, Cuba, Hayti, &c., would be gradually 'annexed'\r\nby it; domestic opposition to its dictates would be summarily suppressed\r\nas treason or 'abolition;' the masses of our people would become like\r\nthe Roman populace under the Cæsars; the forms of a republic might for a\r\nseason be preserved, but the essence would speedily evaporate, leaving a\r\nvast, powerful, rapacious Slave Empire, ruled by some master spirit of\r\nthe slaveholding oligarchy, and wielding all the power of the nation for\r\nthe gratification and aggrandizement of that grasping, unscrupulous\r\naristocracy. Having ceased to be the refuge of the hunted and the\r\ncynosure of the oppressed, this country would thenceforth awe the\r\nnations of the Old World by its military power, and shock them by its\r\nprofligacy, whereof the Ostend Circular and the murders and forgeries of\r\nKansas were but foretastes, until God in His righteous wrath should\r\nbring upon it some visitation like the present, and hurl it from its\r\npinnacle in mercy to mankind.\r\n\r\nMy friend! we must fight on till we conquer. We have no alternative but\r\nabsolute ruin. Our triumph is far nearer than it seems, if we can but\r\nanimate the loyal States to put forth their whole strength for the\r\ncontest. Our armies are mustered; our leaders are chosen; our munitions\r\nprovided; and the Proclamation of Freedom is an immense make-weight\r\nthrown into the right scale. We must and shall conquer, and save the\r\ncivilized world from a scourge more baleful than any Alaric or Attila.\r\n\r\n   Yours, truly,\r\n\r\n   HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANK GOD FOR ALL.\r\n\r\nAIR--'They tell me thou'rt a favored guest;' or,' _Seht ihr drei Rosse\r\nvor dem Wagen_.'\r\n\r\n\r\n   Look back upon the vanished years,\r\n     When all men pointed at our shame;\r\n   Think on the curses and the jeers\r\n     Which rung and clung around our name:\r\n   A byword and a mocking call--\r\n   And we may thank the South for all.\r\n\r\n   The foulness of their Southern slime\r\n     Was cast upon our Northern hands;\r\n   The curse of murder, craft, and crime\r\n     Clung to our fame in foreign lands:\r\n   Men thought us prompt to thieve or brawl--\r\n   And we may thank the South for all.\r\n\r\n   Britannia smiles on DAVIS now,\r\n     And blesses all his bayonets;\r\n   There was a time when on _our_ brow\r\n     She set the shame of Southern debts:\r\n   _We_ wore the chain--we dragged the ball--\r\n   And we may thank the South for all.\r\n\r\n   Men spoke of slaves in bitter tone,\r\n     When pointing to the stripes and stars;\r\n   'The constellation is your own,\r\n     The negro gets the bloody scars,\r\n   And yet of equal rights you bawl!'\r\n   Well--we may thank the South for all.\r\n\r\n   They stole our starlight--made us blind,\r\n     As did of old the Norland elves:\r\n   Prometheus stole it--for mankind,\r\n     But they--they kept it for themselves,\r\n   And held us like their slaves in thrall--\r\n   And we--we thanked them for it all.\r\n\r\n   Thank GOD! the pact is rent in twain!\r\n     Thank GOD! the light is all our own!\r\n   We've burst the bonds and rent the chain,\r\n     And drawn the sword, unhelped, alone:\r\n   And, holding Freedom's carnival,\r\n   We'll thank the South for that and all.\r\n\r\n   The morning-red is on our brow,\r\n     The brand, the curse grows pale with night;\r\n   The sword is in our hands, and now\r\n     All gleams in glory's golden light:\r\n   We're _free_!

The 'office' was a long, low, dingy\r\napartment, with tobacco-stained floor, blackened ceiling, and greasy\r\nbrown walls, ornamented here and there with advertisements of runaway\r\nslaves, auction notices of 'mules, negroes, and other property,' a few\r\ndusty maps, and a number of unframed wood cuts of prominent political\r\ncharacters. Among the latter, Calhoun, in bristling hair, cadaverous\r\nface, and high shirt collar, looked 'the unkindest cut of all.' Behind\r\nthe bar, which extended across the further end of the room, was drawn up\r\na whole regiment of glass decanters, and stout black bottles, full of\r\nspirit, and ready for active service. A generous wood fire roared and\r\ncrackled on a broad hearthstone, and in a semi circle around it, in\r\nevery conceivable attitude, were collected about twenty planters' sons,\r\nvillage shopkeepers, turpentine farmers, itinerant horse dealers, and\r\ncattle drovers. Some had their heels a trifle higher than their heads,\r\nsome were seated on the knees of others, some were lounging on the arms\r\nof chairs, and some were stretched at full length on a pile of trunks\r\nnear by; but all were too much engaged in smoking, expectorating, and\r\nlistening to a horse-trading narrative, which one of their number was\r\nrelating, to heed my entrance.\r\n\r\n'Wall, ye see,' said the story teller, 'Dick come the possum over him;\r\nmade b'lieve he was drunk, though he warn't, no more'n I ar; but he tuk\r\ndarned good keer ter see the ole man get well slewed, he did. Wall, wen\r\nthe ole feller wus pooty well primed, Dick stuck his arm inter his'n,\r\ntoted him off ter the stable, and fotched out a ole spavin'd,\r\nwind-galled, used-up, broken-down critter, thet couldn't gwo a rod,\r\n'cept ye got another hoss to haul him; and says he: 'See thar; thar's a\r\nperfect paragone o' hossflesh; a raal Arab; nimble's a cricket; sunder'n\r\na nut; gentler'n a cooin' dove, and faster'n a tornado! I doan't sell\r\n'im fur nary fault, and ye couldn't buy 'im fur no price, ef I warn't\r\nhard put. Come, now, what d'ye say? I'll put 'im ter ye fur one fifty,\r\nan' it's less'n he cost, it ar!' Wall, the ole man tuk--swallowed the\r\ncritter whole--tuk him down without greasing, he did! ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'Ha! ha!' repeated the listening crowd, and 'Yah! yah!' echoed three or\r\nfour well-dressed darkies, who were standing near the doorway: 'Sarved\r\n'im right; he'm a mean ole cuss, he am;' chimed in one of the latter\r\ngentry, as he added another guffaw, and, swaying his body back and\r\nforth, brought his hands down on his thighs with a concussion which sent\r\na thick cloud of tobacco smoke, of his own manufacture, circling to the\r\nother side of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the merriment had somewhat subsided, I stepped toward the\r\nassemblage, and inquired if the landlord were present. There was no\r\nreply for a few moments; then one of the embryo planters, speaking to a\r\nshowily-dressed young man near him, remarked:\r\n\r\n'Get up, and tend ter the stranger; ye arn't fit to tote vituals to a\r\nnigger.'\r\n\r\nThe young man rose very deliberately, and said:\r\n\r\n'Want ter see the keeper, do ye?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, I want, a room, and supper for two, at once.'\r\n\r\n'Room and supper fur two?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, a room with a fire and two beds.'\r\n\r\n'Whar d'ye come from?'\r\n\r\n'From Goldsboro'; just in by the stage.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! stage's in, is it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, the stage is in. You'll oblige me by attending to us at once;\r\nwe are hungry and tired.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a moment without speaking, then leisurely walked out\r\nof the front door. Two or three of the loungers followed, but the young\r\ngentleman who had first spoken rose and politely tendered me a seat.\r\nThanking him, I took the chair vacated by the bartender, and proceeded\r\nto warm my hands and limbs, which were thoroughly chilled by the long\r\nride in the cold air.\r\n\r\n'Cold, riding after nightfall, sir,' said the young man, who I now\r\nobserved was the Mr. Gaston whom the trader had so unceremoniously\r\nejected from the shooting ground.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, it _is_ cold riding on the box.'\r\n\r\n'And our rattle-down coaches are so mighty slow; you don't have such\r\nfixin's at the North.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir; but why do you suppose I'm from the North? I've passed for a\r\nSoutherner to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I know you Yankees all to pieces; I've lived among you.'\r\n\r\n'At college, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, at Harvard.'\r\n\r\n'You graduated early.'\r\n\r\n'No, I didn't graduate, I _left_--left for my health. Ha! ha I' and he\r\nbroke into a merry fit of laughter, in which several of his companions\r\njoined.\r\n\r\n'Taken with sudden illness, as you were at the turkey-match, to-day?' I\r\ninquired good humoredly, and in a tone that could not give offence.\r\n\r\n'Yes, the same disease, I swear. Ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'Ha! ha!' echoed his companions,\r\n\r\n'The stranger's inter ye, Gus--inter ye a feet! Come, ye must treat,'\r\nshouted the teller of the horse story.\r\n\r\nThis last individual was tall, raw-boned, and squarely built, with\r\nbroad, heavy features, and dull, cold, snake-like eyes. His black,\r\nunkempt hair, and long, wiry beard, fell round his face like tow round a\r\nmop handle, and his coarse linsey clothes, patched in many places, and\r\nsmeared with tar and tobacco juice, fitted him as a shirt might fit a\r\nbean pole. The legs of his pantaloons were thrust inside of his boots,\r\nand he wore a fuzzy woollen hat with battered crown and a broad flapping\r\nbrim. He looked the very picture of an ex-overseer under a cloud, or an\r\nitinerant sporting man, anxious for something to turn up.\r\n\r\nI declined the proffered drink, but the company rose and approached the\r\ncounter, while the young planter bade the bartender, who had just\r\nreëntered, 'trot out the consolation.'\r\n\r\n'Down with the pewter, then, Mr. Gaston,' said the liquor vender. 'No\r\npay, no drinks, is the rule in this yere shanty.'\r\n\r\nThe young man tossed him a half-eagle. His companions proceeded to\r\nimbibe a variety of compounds, while he poured out nearly a glass full\r\nof raw whiskey, and drank it down at a swallow. As he replaced the glass\r\non the counter, a slatternly negro woman thrust her head in at the\r\ndoorway, saying:\r\n\r\n'Dar's a 'ooman heah; a wite 'ooman, dat am 'ticler anxyus fur de honor\r\nof Mister Mulock's 'quaintance. She'm in de sittin' room.'\r\n\r\n'Thar's a call fur you, Bony,' said the young planter to the story\r\nteller; 'some young woman with designs on your landed possessions; ha!\r\nha!'\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the other followed the serving woman from the room. He\r\nwas the absconding polygamist for whom the tobacco-chewing female had\r\nventured all the way from Chalk-Leod.\r\n\r\n'Is supper ready, sir?' I asked of the bartender.\r\n\r\n'Supper? I reckon so. Ye'd better go and see,' was the civil reply.\r\n\r\n'Where's the dining room?'\r\n\r\n'Over thar--'tother side the hall.'\r\n\r\nPassing out of the room, I met Preston, and we proceeded together to the\r\nsupper table. When we were seated, I remarked:\r\n\r\n'By the way, I have just seen the husband of our stage coach\r\nacquaintance. He's a rum-looking customer.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I suppose he has taken to drinking again. The whipping and the\r\nloss of Phylly have probably worked on him.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say _he_ is Phylly's husband?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, didn't I tell you?'\r\n\r\n'No. Two wives under one roof! Well, that's more than most white men can\r\nafford.'\r\n\r\n'That's a fact. It's an awkward business; what had better be done?'\r\n\r\n'Done? Why, let him go. You'll be well rid of him. He's a worthless\r\nfellow, or nature dosn't write English. I read 'scoundrel' all over his\r\nface.'\r\n\r\n'He has a bad nature; but Phylly's influence on him is good, and she\r\nloves him.'\r\n\r\n'_Loves_ him! Well, there's no accounting for tastes.'\r\n\r\n'That's true,' replied the Squire; 'but we all love those whom we do\r\ngood to. She married Mulock after nursing him through a long illness,\r\nand she has tamed him, though it was taming a wolf.'\r\n\r\nWe soon left the table. Preston went into the sitting room, while I\r\nresumed my seat by the bar room fire.\r\n\r\nI had nearly finished my evening cigar, when Preston came into the\r\noffice, Shaking hands with young Gaston and a number of the others, who\r\nall greeted him with marked respect. He said to me:\r\n\r\n'What shall I do? Mulock's wife will let him off if I pay her a hundred\r\ndollars.'\r\n\r\n'Pay her a hundred dollars!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'Yes; she'll release him to Phyllis for that--give a paper to that\r\neffect. What would you do?\r\n\r\nThe idea was so ludicrous that, in spite of the Squire's serious manner,\r\nI burst into a fit of laughter. Between the mirthful explosions I\r\nmanaged to say:\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, Preston; but I never before heard of selling a husband--at\r\nso low a price. Ha! ha! Do not buy him; he isn't worth the money.' Then\r\nseeing that he appeared hurt, I added: 'What does Phyllis say?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't told her; she'll feel badly to have him go, but it's not\r\nright for me to pay the money. I should pay my debts first.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gaston, whose attention had been attracted to our conversation by my\r\nrather boisterous conversation, now said, making a strong effort to\r\nappear serious:\r\n\r\n'Excuse me, Squire, but what is it? Has Mulock two wives; and does one\r\noffer to sell out for a hundred dollars?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied Preston, in a tone which showed a decided disinclination\r\nto conversation with him.\r\n\r\n'Buy him, then, Squire; I'll give you twenty-five dollars for the\r\nbargain, on the spot; I will, I swear;' and, unable to contain himself\r\nlonger, he burst into an uproarious fit of merriment, in which the\r\nby-sitters joined.\r\n\r\nPreston's face darkened, and in a grave voice he said:\r\n\r\n'Young man, you forget yourself. I am sorry to see you so wanting in\r\nrespect to others, and--yourself.'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, Mr. Preston,' replied Gaston, in an apologetic tone;\r\n'I meant no offence, sir--upon my soul, I did not. If Mulock is for sale\r\nfor a--'here his risibilities again gave way--'for a hundred dollars,\r\nI'll buy him; for it's cheap; I swear it's cheap, seeing he's a white\r\nman.'\r\n\r\nPreston, by this time really angered, was about to make a harsh reply,\r\nwhen I interrupted him:\r\n\r\n'Never mind, my friend, let Mr. Gaston buy him; he can afford it. Do it,\r\nMr. Gaston; it will be both a capital joke and a good action, do it _at\r\nonce_.'\r\n\r\nThe glass of raw whiskey had somewhat 'elevated' the young planter, and\r\nmy conscience demurred a little at the advice I gave him; but I\r\nrecovered my usual self-complacency on reflecting that he would\r\nundoubtedly put the money to a much worse use.\r\n\r\nSaying, 'D----d if I won't,' Gaston drew forth his purse, and counted\r\nout a number of half eagles. Finding he had not enough, he turned to\r\nanother young planter, and said:\r\n\r\n'Here, Bob, I'm short; lend me fifty dollars.'\r\n\r\n'Bob' produced his wallet, and, without counting them, handed him a roll\r\nof bills.\r\n\r\n'Now, stranger, come along, I shall want you to draw up the papers and\r\nwitness the trade; ha! ha! Is she in the parlor, Squire?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Preston, taking the seat I had vacated.\r\n\r\nThe young man then put his arm into mine, and we proceeded to the\r\n'sitting room.'\r\n\r\nMulock was seated before the fire, gazing intently at the blaze. His\r\nwife sat opposite, speaking earnestly to him. She every now and then\r\nwetted a short piece of wood with saliva, and dipping it into a snuff\r\nbottle, mopped her teeth and gums with the savory powder. She was--as\r\nher husband might have said--a perfect 'paragone' of 'poor white'\r\nwomanhood, with all the accomplishments of her class, smoking, chewing,\r\nsnuff dipping, and whiskey drinking.\r\n\r\nAs we approached, she lifted her eyes, and Gaston said to her:\r\n\r\n'Are you the lady who has a man for sale--a likely white man?'\r\n\r\n'Wall, stranger, I reckon I'm the 'ooman, Thet ar feller's my husband,\r\nan' he karn't git off 'cept I git a hundred dollars.'\r\n\r\n'Will you give a bill of sale, releasing all your right, title, and\r\ninterest in him to me, if I pay you a hundred dollars?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I wull--ter ye, or ter ony-body.'\r\n\r\n'Wall, now,' continued Gaston, imitating her tone, 'karn't yo take a\r\ntrifle less'n thet--eighty or so?'\r\n\r\n'No, stranger, nary dime under thet. I'm gol-durned ef I does.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Mulock, what do you say? Are you willing to be sold?'\r\n\r\n'I haint willin' ter be laff'd at by ye, nor nobody else,' replied\r\nMulock, rising, and turning fiercely on the planter. 'I'll larrup the\r\nd----d 'ooman ony how, and ye, too, ef ye say much more.'\r\n\r\n'Come, Mulock,' said the young man, coolly, but firmly, 'be civil, or\r\nI'll let daylight through you before you're a minute older. I'm disposed\r\nto do you a good turn, but you must be civil, by----.'\r\n\r\n'Wall, do as ye likes, Gus; onything'll suit me,' replied Mulock,\r\nresuming his previous position.\r\n\r\n'But, d---- you, if I spend a hundred on you, you must go to work like a\r\nman, and try to pay it. I wouldn't do it anyhow, if it warn't for\r\nPhylly.'\r\n\r\n'But Phylly's gone,' said Mulock in a dejected tone; 'gone--toted off by\r\nthet d----d trader. If I hadn't a ben in the cussed jug, I'd a killed\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'No she isn't gone; she's here--Preston's bought her.'\r\n\r\nMulock sprang to his feet; his dull, cold eye lighted, and seizing the\r\nyoung man by the arm, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Doan't ye lie ter me, Gus; _is_ she yere?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, so Bob says; he saw her get out of the stage.'\r\n\r\nMulock made no reply, but strode toward the door. Gaston said quickly:\r\n\r\n'Hold on, Bony, don't vamoose just yet. D----d if I'll help you out of\r\nthis if you don't promise to work like an honest fellow to pay me.'\r\n\r\n'I will, Gus; I'll leave off drinkin' ter onst; I'll work day and night,\r\nI will.'\r\n\r\n'Well, my rustic beauty, are you ready to sign a bill of sale?'\r\n\r\n'Yas; but I reckon, bein's as ye set so high on Bony, ye kin go a trifle\r\nmore'n thet; jest the 'spences down yere?'\r\n\r\n'Not another red,' said Gaston.\r\n\r\n'Wall, he ain't of no account, nohow; I reckon he ain't wuth no more.\r\nCount out th' pewter.'\r\n\r\nI procured writing utensils from the bar room, and in a few moments drew\r\nup a paper, by which, in consideration of one hundred dollars, to her in\r\nhand, that day paid, Jane Mulock, of Chalk Level, in the county of\r\nHarnet, and State of North Carolina, did sell, assign, transfer, make\r\nover, convey, and forever quit claim unto Phyllis Preston, otherwise\r\nknown as Phyllis Mulock, of the town of Newbern, in the county of\r\nCraven, and State aforesaid, all her right, title, and interest in and\r\nto the body, soul, wearing apparel, and other possessions, of one\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte Mulock, whom the said Jane charged with being her\r\nhusband; and also all claims or demands she had on him for a support,\r\nshe binding herself never to institute any suit or suits against him in\r\nany court of the State of North Carolina, or of any other State, or of\r\nthe United States, for the crime of bigamy, or for any other crime,\r\nmisdemeanor, or abomination committed against herself at any time prior\r\nto the date of said instrument. In testimony whereof she, the said Jane\r\nMulock, did sign the sign of the cross, and affix her seal to a half\r\nsheet of dirty paper, whereto Gustavus A. Gaston, and the writer hereof,\r\nwere witnesses.[4]\r\n\r\nBoth Mulock and his wife thought the instrument a valid one. He again\r\ntook Phyllis to his bosom, and Jane, I have been told, married another\r\nhusband. In view of the latter fact, I have never been able to wholly\r\nsatisfy my conscience for the part I took in the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at breakfast on the following morning, Preston said to me:\r\n\r\n'I think I had better leave Phylly and Rosey here till I can consult\r\nwith my wife; we have house servants enough, and Phylly can't work in\r\nthe field. It may be advisable to let her remain in Newbern.'\r\n\r\n'And what will you do with the little yellow boy?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, take him with us. There's always something the little fellows can\r\ndo. We'll call at his mother's and get him.'\r\n\r\nWe decided to set out for the plantation at once, and Preston ordered a\r\nlivery wagon to be got in readiness. While we were waiting for it, I\r\nstrolled out upon the piazza. I had not been there long before 'young\r\nJoe,' Preston's only son, rode up to the hotel. He was a manly lad,\r\nabout twelve years of age, and in form, features, and manner, a\r\nminiature edition of his father. He had grown amazingly since at my\r\nhouse, two years before, and I did not at once recognize him; but as\r\nsoon as he caught sight of me, he shouted out in boyish glee, throwing\r\nhis bridle over the hitching post, and springing to the ground.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Mr. Kirke! I'm so glad you've come; mother will be _so_ glad to see\r\nyou. We'll have such a nice time,' and he seized me by the hand, and\r\nshook it energetically.\r\n\r\n'Why, Joe, I thought you were at home!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no! I'm here at school, but father says I'm to have a vacation\r\nwhile you're here. Why didn't you fetch Frank? You promised you would.'\r\n\r\n'I know I did, Joe, but his mother wouldn't let him come; she thinks\r\nhe's too young to travel.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! He's old enough--most as old as I am; but never mind, Mr. Kirke;\r\nwe'll have a fine time, hunting and fishing, and going to the races.\r\nThey're going to have a big one over to Trenton next week, and I'm dying\r\nto go; it's _so_ lucky you've come.'\r\n\r\n'Lord bless you, Joe, I never went to a race, and never shot a gun in my\r\nlife; besides, I can remain only a day or so.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, you can; father says you Yorkers are always in a hurry; but\r\nyou must take it easy now. I'll show you round, and learn you the\r\nropes.'\r\n\r\nWhile I was laughing at the enthusiasm of the young lad, the wagon drove\r\nup, and Preston soon appearing, we entered it and drove off. As Joe\r\nbounded upon his spirited horse and led the way down the elm-shaded\r\nstreet, I said to his father:\r\n\r\n'How that boy rides; he's a perfect Centaur.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he _is_ a good horseman. He's been trained to it. You know we\r\nthink manly exercises an essential part of a gentleman's education.'\r\n\r\n'And you let Joe keep his own horse?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it's awfully expensive; but old Joe raised the colt for the boy,\r\nand I couldn't deny him.'\r\n\r\nWe rode on until we reached the outskirts of the town, when we stopped\r\nbefore a small, tumble-down shanty, built of rough boards, and roofed\r\nwith the same material. In the narrow front yard, a large iron pot,\r\nsupported on two upright poles, was steaming over a light wood fire. The\r\nboiling clothes it contained were being stirred by a brawny, coal black\r\nnegro woman, with an arm like the Farnese Hercules, and a form as stout\r\nas Wouter Van Twiller's. The yellow boy, Ally, was heaping wood on the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n'How do you do, aunty?' said Preston, as we drew up at the rickety gate.\r\n\r\n'Right smart, massa, right smart,' replied the woman; then turning round\r\nand recognizing the Squire, she added: 'Oh, massa Preston, am dat 'ou?\r\nOh! I'se so 'joiced 'ou got Ally; I'se _so_ 'joiced! De Lord hear my\r\nprayer, massa--de Lord hear my prayer. I feel like I die wid joy, de\r\nLord so good ter me. Oh, He'm so good ter me!'\r\n\r\n'The Lord is good to all who love Him; He never fails those that trust\r\nin Him,' said Preston, solemnly.\r\n\r\n'No more'n He doan't, massa; no more'n he doan't. De good missus tole me\r\ndat jess af'er dey toted de pore chile 'way; but I couldn't b'lieve it,\r\nmassa, I couldn't b'lieve it. It 'peared like I neber see 'im\r\nagin--neber see 'im agin, but I prayed de Lord, massa, I prayed de Lord\r\nall de time--all de time dat de chile wus 'way; I hab no sleep, I eat\r\nmost nuffin, an' my heart grow so big, I fought it would clean broke;\r\nbut lass night, jess wen it 'peared like I couldn't stan' it no more;\r\nwen I wus a cryin' an' a groanin' to de Lord wid all my might, den,\r\nmassa, de Lord, He hard me, an' He open de door, an' de little chile run\r\nin, an' put him arms round my neck, and he telled me I need neber cry no\r\nmore, 'case de good massa Preston hab got him! Oh, it wus too much,\r\nmassa, fur 'ou's so good, de Lord's so good, massa! Oh, I feel like I\r\nshould die ob joy.' Here she sat down on a rude bench near by, covered\r\nher face with her apron, and sobbed like a child. Preston's eyes filled\r\nwith tears, but brushing them hastily away, he asked, as if to change\r\nthe subject:\r\n\r\n'Did you say the 'missus' had been down?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, massa, de good missus come down jess so soon as she hard Phylly\r\nwar sold, an' wen she fine Ally war gwine too, she come ter see de ole\r\n'ooman, she did, massa--and she try to comfut me. She say de good Lord\r\nwould fotch Ally back, and He hab, massa! Oh, He hab!'\r\n\r\n'Well, Dinah, what shall we do with Ally? Do you want him to go to the\r\nplantation?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yas, massa, I want de chile ter be wid 'ou. I'd _rudder_ he'd be\r\nwid 'ou, massa; but massa'--and she spoke timidly, and with\r\nhesitation--''ou knows ole massa promise ter sell Ally ter me--ter sell\r\n'im ter me wen I'd a sabed up 'nuff ter buy 'im. An' will 'ou, massa,\r\nwill 'ou?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Dinah, of course I will,' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'Oh! bress 'ou, massa; bress 'ou. It'm so good ob 'ou, _so_ good ob 'ou,\r\nmassa;' and she sobbed harder than before.\r\n\r\n'How much have you saved up, aunty?'\r\n\r\n'A hun'red and firteen, massa; an' dar's some more'n dat massa Blackwell\r\nam ter gib fur de usin' on it. Massa Blackwell got it. How much shill I\r\npay fur Ally, massa?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know; the trader offered three hundred for him; you may\r\nhave him for half that.'\r\n\r\n'How much 's dat, massa?'\r\n\r\n'A hundred and fifty dollars.'\r\n\r\n'He'm wuth more'n dat, massa Preston; ole massa say Ally wuth two\r\nhun'red an' fifty or three hun'red ob any folks' money. He'm a likely\r\nboy, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know that; I don't mean to undervalue him. I wouldn't sell him\r\nto any one else for less than three hundred dollars.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! tank 'ou, massa; it'm good ob 'ou; berry good ob 'ou, massa;' and\r\nagain her apron found the way to her eyes.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Preston, after a moment's thought, 'I think you'd better\r\ntake the boy now, aunty. I'm in some trouble, and I don't know how\r\nthings may turn with me; so you'd better take him now.'\r\n\r\n'But I hain't money 'nuff now, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Well, never mind; pay the rest when you can, but don't scrimp yourself\r\nas you have, Dinah; I shan't care if you never pay it.'\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed bewildered, but said nothing. She evidently was\r\nunaccustomed to Preston's mode of doing business. I mentioned to him\r\nthat he could not give a conveyance of the negro boy until the judgment\r\nagainst him was cancelled.\r\n\r\n'True,' he replied; 'I didn't think of that. Shall we attend to it now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, at once; further costs may accumulate if you delay.'\r\n\r\nPreston told the negro woman to meet him by eleven o'clock, at the store\r\nof the person who had charge of her money, and we rode at once to the\r\n'Old State Bank.' Its doors were not then opened, but as the cashier\r\nresided in the building, we soon secured notes in exchange for Preston's\r\ndraft on me, and in less than an hour had the judgment satisfied, and\r\nAlly's free papers, properly made out and executed. It was not quite ten\r\no'clock when, as we were leaving the attorney's office, we noticed the\r\nslave woman and her son seated on the steps of Mr. Blackwell's store.\r\n\r\n'Are you all ready, aunty?' asked Preston.\r\n\r\n'Yes, massa, I'se all ready; I'se got de gole all heah,' she replied,\r\nholding up a small canvas bag; 'a hun'red an' twenty-sevin dollar an'\r\nfirty cents--so massa Blackwell say; I karn't reckon so much as dat,\r\nmassa.'\r\n\r\nThe woman had made an effort to 'spruce up' for the interview, by\r\nputting on a clean white neckerchief, and a bran new pair of brogans,\r\nbut she still wore the tattered red and yellow turban, and the thin,\r\ncoarse Osnaburg gown, clean, but patched in many places--in which she\r\nwas arrayed when bending over the wash kettle.\r\n\r\nThe merchant then came to the door, and invited us in; Preston handed\r\nhim the papers to examine, and we all entered the store. As the woman\r\nlaid the gold on the counter, I said to her:\r\n\r\n'Aunty, how long have you been in saving this money?'\r\n\r\n'Four year, massa. Ole massa wouldn't'gree ter sell de chile till four\r\nyear ago.'\r\n\r\n'And you've hired your time, and earned this by washing and ironing?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar I'se had ter pay massa a hun'red and firty dollar ebery year,\r\n'sides twenty fur rent; an' I'se had ter work bery hard, of'en till 'way\r\ninter de night, but I wanted to hab de chile FREE, massa.'\r\n\r\n'And have you had no husband to help you?'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, I never had none; I never tuk ter de men folks.'\r\n\r\nShe was, as I have said, of a coal-black complexion, while Ally's skin\r\nwas a bright yellow. His father, therefore, must have been a white man.\r\n\r\n'You have worked very hard, no doubt, aunty; are these the best clothes\r\nyou have?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, dese am _all_ I'se got.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, tank'ou, massa. 'Ou's too good, massa; tank'ou bery much--but\r\n'ou'll leff' me gib dis ter de Squire, massa, 'on't 'ou? I wants ter pay\r\nfur Ally.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, if he will take it, 'I replied, for I knew that he would not.\r\n\r\nThe merchant had examined the documents, and Preston had counted the\r\nmoney and put it in his pocket, when, handing the papers to Dinah, the\r\nlatter said:\r\n\r\n'Now, aunty, Ally's free, and I hope he'll prove a good boy, and worthy\r\nof such a mother.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he will dat, massa; he'm a good chile; but heah'm ten dollar more\r\nmassa, it'm de good gemman's, an' he say I kin gib it ter 'on fur Ally.'\r\n\r\nPreston laughed: 'I heard what he said. I can't take it, Dinah. You need\r\nit to buy some winter clothes. I'll take the risk of what you owe me.'\r\n\r\nThe shopkeeper then said:\r\n\r\n'Take it, Mr. Preston; I'll let Dinah have what she needs out of the\r\nstore; she knows her credit is good with me.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Preston, taking the money, 'this makes one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven dollars and thirty cents. You need not pay any more--Ally\r\nis yours _now_.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! am Ally _free_, massa? Am de chile FREE? she exclaimed, taking him\r\nin her arms, and bursting into a hysterical fit of weeping.\r\n\r\nEvery eye was wet, but no one spoke. At last Dinah said:\r\n\r\n'But, massa Preston, I wants 'ou ter take de chile. I wants 'ou ter\r\nfetch him up. I karn't larn him nuffin. I doan't know nuffin massa. He\r\nkin git larnin' wid 'ou.'\r\n\r\n'But he's all you have. He'll be a help and a comfort, to you at home.'\r\n\r\n'I doan't want no help, massa. He'm FREE now--I doan't want no help no\r\nmore.'\r\n\r\n'Well, aunty, I'll take him, and pay you twenty dollars a year, till\r\nhe's fifteen. He's ten now, isn't he?'\r\n\r\n'A'most ten, massa, a'most; but 'ou needn't pay me nuffin; jess gib de\r\nchile what you likes. And massa, 'ou'll speak ter Boss Joe 'bout him,\r\nwoan't 'ou? 'Ou'll ax him ter see Ally gwoe ter de meetin's an' larn out\r\nob de books, woan't 'ou, massa? I wants him ter know suffin, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will, Dinah, and I'll keep an eye on him myself.'\r\n\r\n'Tank 'ou, massa; an' p'raps' ou'll leff de chile come ter see him ole\r\nmammy once'n a while?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he may--once a month. Come now, Dinah, get into the wagon; we go\r\nright by your house.'\r\n\r\nWe entered the vehicle, and drove off. When we reached the shanty, the\r\nnegress got out, and, amid a shower of blessings from her, we rode on to\r\nthe plantation. For four long years she had worked fifteen hours a day,\r\nand denied herself every comfort to buy her child; and when at last she\r\nhad secured his freedom, she was willing to part with him that he might\r\n'larn suffin out ob de books.' Who that reads this truthful record of a\r\nslave mother's love, will deny to her wretched race the instincts and\r\nfeelings that make _us_ human?\r\n\r\nIt was a clear, cold, sunshiny day--one of those days so peculiar to the\r\nSouthern climate, when the blood hounds through every vein as if\r\nthrilled by electricity, and a man of lively temperament can scarcely\r\nrestrain his legs from dancing a 'breakdown.' We rode rapidly on through\r\na timbered country, where the tall trees grew up close by the roadside,\r\nlocking their huge arms high in the air, and the long, graceful, black\r\nmoss hung like mourning drapery from their great branches. The green\r\npine-tassels, which carpeted the ground, crackled beneath our horses'\r\nfeet, and breathed a grateful odor around us; and the soft autumn wind,\r\nwhich rustled the leaves and swayed the tops of the old trees, sang a\r\npleasant song over our heads. Every pine bore the scars of the\r\nturpentine axe, and here and there we came upon a patch of woods where\r\nthe negroes were gathering the 'last dipping;' and now and then we\r\npassed an open clearing where a poor planter was at work with a few\r\nfield hands. Occasionally we forded a small stream, where, high up on\r\nthe bank, was a rude ferry, which served in the rainy season as a\r\nmiserable substitute for a bridge; and once in a while, far back from\r\nthe road, we caught sight of an old country-seat, whose dingy, unpainted\r\nwalls, broken down fences, and dilapidated surroundings reminded one\r\nthat shiftless working men, and careless, reckless proprietors, are the\r\nnatural products of slavery. Thus we rode on for several hours, till,\r\nturning a slight bend in the road, we suddenly halted before the gateway\r\nof my friend's plantation. I had observed for half a mile that the woods\r\nwhich lined the wayside were clear of underbrush, the felled trees\r\ntrimmed, and their branches carefully piled in heaps, and the rails,\r\nwhich in other places straggled about in the road, were doing their\r\nappropriate duty on the fences; and I said to Preston:\r\n\r\n'I am glad to see you are as good at planting as you are at preaching.'\r\n\r\n'Bless you,' he replied, 'it isn't me--it's Joe. Joe is acknowledged to\r\nbe the best farmer in Jones county.'\r\n\r\nAt the gateway we met such a greeting as is unknown all the world over,\r\noutside of a Southern plantation. Perched in the fences, swinging on the\r\ngate, and hanging from the trees, were a score of young ebonies of both\r\nsexes, who, as we came in sight, set up a chorus of discordant shouts\r\nthat made the woods ring. Among the noises I made out: 'Gorry, massa am\r\ncome!' 'Dar dey is.' 'Dat'm de strange gem-man.' 'How's 'ou, massa?'\r\n'Glad 'ou's come, massa; 'peared like we'd neber see 'ou no more,\r\nmassa;' and a multitude of similiar exclamations, that told unmistakably\r\nthe character of the discipline to which they were accustomed. The young\r\nchattels are an infallible barometer--they indicate the real state of\r\nthe weather on a plantation. One may never see among the older slaves of\r\neven a cruel master, any but sunshiny faces, for they know the penalty\r\nof surliness before a stranger; but the little darkies cannot be so\r\nrestrained. They will slink away into by-corners, or scamper out of\r\nsight whenever their owner appears, if they are not treated kindly.\r\n\r\n'Massa's well. Are you all well?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, massa, we's right smart; an' all on we's good little nigs eber\r\nsense 'ou's 'way.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad to hear it; now, scamper back to the house, and tell 'missus'\r\nwe're coming.'\r\n\r\n'Missus knows 'ou's comin', massa; massa Joe am dar; missus knows 'ou's\r\nI comin'.'\r\n\r\nAfter a short drive over a narrow winding avenue, strewn with leaves and\r\nshaded with the long branches of the pine, the oak, and the holly, we\r\ncame to the mansion, which stood on a gentle mound in the midst of a\r\ngreen lawn, sloping gently down to a small lake. It had once been a\r\nsquare, box-like structure; but Preston had so transformed it, that but\r\nfor its rustic surroundings and the thick groups of giant evergreens\r\nwhich clustered at its sides, it might have been taken for a suburban\r\nvilla. Projecting eaves, large dormers, which sprang out from the\r\nroof-line and rested on a broad porch and balcony, a rustic _porte\r\ncochere_, and here and there a vine-covered bay or oriole window, broke\r\nup the regularity of its outline, and proclaimed its designer a true\r\npoet--and poetry, now-a-days, is more often written on the walls of\r\ncountry houses than in the corners of country newspapers.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the 'family,' excepting the field hands, had gathered to\r\nwitness our arrival; but there was no shouting or noisy demonstrations.\r\nAfter we had greeted Mrs. Preston and her two little daughters--her twin\r\nroses, as she called them--my host turned to the assembled negroes, and\r\ngave each one his hand and a kind word. The hearty 'Lord bress 'ou, good\r\nmassa,' and 'Glad 'ou's come, massa,' which broke from all of them,\r\nwould have gladdened the heart of even the bitterest opponent of the\r\npeculiar institution. One old woman, whose head was as white as snow,\r\nand whose bent form showed great age, sat on a lower step of the porch,\r\nsurrounded by a cluster of children. Her mistress raised her to her feet\r\nas Preston approached; and throwing her trembling arms around his neck,\r\nshe sobbed out:\r\n\r\n'Oh, massa Robert, ole nussy am happy now; she'll neber leff 'ou gwo\r\n'way agin.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Preston shortly turned to lead the way into the house. As she did\r\nso, I noticed peeping from out the folds of her dress, where she had\r\nshyly hid away, a younger child, of strange and wonderful beauty. She\r\nhad not, like the others, the fair complexion and pure Grecian features\r\nof her mother. Her skin was dark, and her hair, which fell in glossy\r\ncurls over her neck, was as black as the night when the clouds have shut\r\nout the stars. Her cheeks seemed two rose leaves thinly sprinkled with\r\nsnow; her eyes, coals which held a smouldering flame. Her face was one\r\nof those caught now and then by the old painters--a thing dreamed of,\r\nbut seldom seen: the pure expression of an ideal loveliness which is\r\nmore than human. She seemed some pure, spiritual being, which had left\r\nits ethereal home and come to earth to make the world brighter and\r\nbetter by its presence. I reached out my hands to her, and said:\r\n\r\n'Come here, my little one. This is one I have not seen, Mrs. Preston.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir; we have never taken her North; she is too young yet. Go to the\r\ngentleman, my pet.'\r\n\r\nThe child came timidly toward me, and suffered me to lift her in my\r\narms:\r\n\r\n'And what is your name, my little one?'\r\n\r\n'Selly, sar,' she replied, with the soft, mellow accent, which the\r\nplanter's children acquire from the negroes.\r\n\r\n'What an odd name!' I remarked,\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, it _is_ singular. Her full name is Selma,' replied her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n'What! who have we here?' exclaimed Preston, as he turned away from the\r\nnegroes, and stepped up on the piazza.\r\n\r\n'Why, Robert, it's Selly--don't you know your own child?'\r\n\r\nPreston took the little girl in his arms, and said:\r\n\r\n'It's like you, Lucy. No man ever had a wife like mine, Kirke.'\r\n\r\n'No one but Mr. Kirke himself, you mean, Robert,' replied the lady,\r\nsmiling; then she added:\r\n\r\n'Selly has been in Newbern for a time, Mr. Preston did not expect to\r\nfind her at home.'\r\n\r\nWe entered the house, and took seats in the drawing room to await\r\ndinner. We had not been there long, when 'Master Joe' burst into the\r\napartment, and rushing up to me, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Come, Mr. Kirke, Joe is outside; he wants to see you--come.'\r\n\r\n'Tell Joe to wait; don't disturb Mr. Kirke now,' said his father,\r\n\r\n'Oh no, Preston; let me see him at once;' and rising, I followed the lad\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nJoe was a dark-colored mulatto, about fifty years of age. He was dressed\r\nin a suit of 'butternut homespun,' and held in his hand the ordinary\r\nslouched hat worn by the 'natives.' His hair, the short, crispy wool of\r\nthe African, was sprinkled with gray, and he had the thick lips and\r\nbroad, heavy features of his race. He was nearly six feet high, stoutly\r\nand compactly built; and but for a disproportion in the size of his\r\nlegs, one of which was smaller and two or three inches shorter than the\r\nother, he might have rated as a 'prime field hand.' There was nothing\r\nabout him but his high, massive head, clear, piercing eye, and a certain\r\nself-poised manner, to indicate that he was more than an ordinary negro.\r\n\r\n'Now, Joe, this is Mr. Kirke; make your best bow, old fellow,' shouted\r\nthe lad, as we opened the door, and stepped out on the piazza. Joe made\r\nthe requisite bow, and reaching out his hand, said:\r\n\r\n'I'se bery glad ter see you, Mr. Kirke.'\r\n\r\n'I'm very glad to see you, Joseph; I feel well acquainted with you,' I\r\nreplied, returning his cordial greeting.\r\n\r\n'I feels well 'quainted wid _you_, sar. I'se wanted ter see you bery\r\nmuch, Mr. Kirke. You'll 'scuse my sturbin' you; but de boy'--and he laid\r\nhis hand on the lad's head--' 'sisted ou my comin' ter onst.'\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, his master came out of the house.\r\n\r\n'Welcome home, massa Robert,' said the black man, taking Preston warmly\r\nby the hand, and then adding in a quick, anxious tone:\r\n\r\n'What luck in Virginny? Did you do it, massa Robert?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Preston, 'I couldn't get a dollar--not a dollar, Joe.'\r\n\r\n'I feared dat--I feared dat, massa Robert. Nobody keer nuffin' fur you\r\nbut ole Joe--nobody but ole Joe, massa Robert!' His eyes moistened, and\r\nhe spoke in an inexpressibly tender tone--the tone of a mother when\r\nspeaking to her child.\r\n\r\n'Nobody but Mr. Kirke, Joe. He has paid the judgment.'\r\n\r\n'Bress you, Mr. Kirke, de Lord bress you, sar. But dar's more you knows,\r\nmassa Robert. You tole Mr. Kirke 'bout dem?'\r\n\r\n'No, Joe. I know I ought to; but I couldn't.\r\n\r\n'P'raps Mr. Kirke wouldn't hab paid dat, if he'd know'd de whole!' said\r\nJoe, in a hesitating tone.\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly I would, Joe. It's no great matter, I'm sure,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Well, Joe, never mind this now. We'll talk affairs all over with Mr.\r\nKirke before he goes,' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'Dat's right, massa Robert; gemman like Mr. Kirke knows 'bout dese tings\r\nbetter'n you nor me.'\r\n\r\nSaying we would see him again that day, Preston and I then reëntered the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This transaction, improbable as it may seem to Northern\r\nreaders, occurred literally as I have narrated it.--The AUTHOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENLISTING!\r\n\r\n\r\n   There's not a trade agoing,\r\n   Worth knowing or showing,\r\n   Like that from glory growing!\r\n     Says the bold soldier boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREED MEN OF THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA question of great magnitude, concerning the fate of vast numbers of\r\nfreed men in the South, and affecting material interests of world-wide\r\nimportance, is looming up and shaping itself among the clouds which\r\nsurround us, and is daily growing more pressing in its demand for\r\nsolution, and for wise and beneficent action. The entire social and\r\nindustrial arrangements of the South are likely to be completely\r\ndisorganized, and more or less permanently broken up. The civil war\r\nitself, in its very nature, from its avowed principles and purposes, was\r\nwell calculated to produce this result; but the proclamation of the\r\nPresident, declaring emancipation after the 1st of January next, in all\r\nthe rebellious States, comes in at this critical moment speedily to\r\nperfect the work which the madness of the rebels had already begun.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to consider the legal effect of that measure; its\r\nconformity to the Constitution, or to the laws of war; its necessity and\r\npropriety under existing circumstances; or its bearing and probable\r\ninfluence on the duration of the war and the ultimate restoration of the\r\nUnion. It would be worse than useless to embarrass and cripple ourselves\r\nwith these questions, at the present time, when it is wholly beyond our\r\npower to arrest the march of events, and prevent the consummation to\r\nwhich they inevitably tend. The thunderbolt has been launched; and\r\nalthough it pauses in the air or moves slowly in its ominous path, it\r\nhas been seen of all men, and cannot be effectually recalled. Its\r\ninevitable results are already to a great extent secured. The idea of\r\nhis liberation has been imparted to the slave, and it takes hold of his\r\nmind as a spark would adhere to dry wood in a high wind. Every breath of\r\nair causes it to spread; it cannot be extinguished.\r\n\r\nWhatever view may be taken of Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, and of its\r\neffect on the mass of slaves in the rebellious States, a very large and\r\nincreasing number will certainly escape from bondage and force their way\r\ninto the lines of our army, with every advance which it makes into the\r\nenemy's territory. Our Government invites them and the army will be\r\nbound to receive them. It may be safely assumed that many thousands (it\r\nis hardly possible to say how many) will throw themselves into our\r\npower; and they will certainly have the strongest possible claim to the\r\ncare and protection of those who have lured them from such homes as they\r\npossessed, from regular employment and adequate sustenance, and from all\r\nfixed habits of their peculiar condition. Winter will be already upon\r\nthem, and they will be without homes, and in a great measure, too,\r\nwithout food and clothes. It is not possible that the large numbers\r\ndestined to abandon their masters at the call of the President, can be\r\nadvantageously employed as laborers and servants in the army, and it\r\nwill therefore be absolutely necessary to find other useful and\r\nappropriate occupations for them, sufficiently profitable to make them\r\nsure of subsistence and of some degree of comfort, from the inception of\r\ntheir new condition.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the plantation negroes, and, indeed, the\r\nnegroes generally, in all the rebellious States, have never been\r\naccustomed to take care of themselves, or even to direct their own daily\r\nlabors. They have not the least experience in the management of affairs,\r\nexcept under the control of masters or overseers. They have neither\r\nforesight nor enterprise, nor any cultivated capacity to provide for\r\ntheir own wants or for those of their families. If they have lived as\r\nfamilies at all, the head of the domestic organization has never had\r\nthe responsibility which naturally belongs to that position, and,\r\nconsequently, has not acquired any of the manly and noble impulses which\r\nthe sense of that responsibility invariably gives. These unfortunate\r\ncreatures, deprived of all opportunity for education, never having known\r\nthe cares and blessings of independence, but receiving their daily\r\nsupport from the hand which guided and compelled their labor, emerge\r\nfrom this condition almost as helpless as children. Generally, in the\r\nglimmering twilight of their intellects, they entertain no other idea of\r\nliberty but that of living without work. Doubtless they will readily\r\narrive at a better understanding of their new condition; but it is of\r\nimmense importance that they shall be started in the right path and\r\ntutored in the ways of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe authority which will have thus taken them, suddenly and without any\r\npreparation, from their recent employments and their old modes of life,\r\nmust not leave them, helpless and without resources, to find such\r\noccupations as they may. The sacred obligation rests upon us to give\r\nthem some suitable employment from which they can procure present\r\nsubsistence and commence that career of industry and improvement which,\r\nit is to be hoped, will soon prove them to have been worthy of the boon\r\nunintentionally bestowed upon them by the authors of this wicked and\r\ninsane rebellion. Some other governments, in seasons of distress arising\r\nfrom ordinary causes, do not hesitate to acknowledge the duty of finding\r\nwork for the laboring masses, who would otherwise suffer and become\r\ndangerous in their distress and desperation; but there is no case in\r\nwhich the obligations of government toward an unfortunate people are\r\nhalf so strong and imperative as those which, under existing\r\ncircumstances, rest upon the United States. They have the double\r\nresponsibility of past complication in the wrong of slavery, and of\r\npresent participation in the act of suddenly terminating it.\r\n\r\nDoubtless an effective system of colonization, beyond our limits, will\r\nbe gradually established, and the Africans in this country will\r\neventually find it to be their interest to separate themselves from us\r\nand to go in large numbers to Central America or to their native\r\ncontinent. But this process must necessarily be slow, and cannot\r\nproperly take place on any very large scale until the negroes shall be\r\nto some extent trained in the proper habits of freedom and prepared to\r\nbecome citizens of some country in which their rights of equality will\r\nbe fully acknowledged, not merely theoretically and by profession, but\r\nin substance and in actual practice. Moreover, they cannot be sent away\r\nwith advantage to us, or, indeed, by means of any available resources\r\napplicable to that end, until their places shall be supplied by European\r\nimmigrants, or until the increase of our own white population shall\r\nenable us to dispense with their services amongst us, and aid them in\r\nfinding and settling better homes, in which they may pursue their\r\ndestined course of progress, unhindered by that fatal competition and\r\nunconquerable prejudice which meet them here. It is evident that no\r\npossible scheme of colonization can relieve us from the duty of\r\nproviding for the present and immediate necessities of the vast numbers\r\nof freed men who will shortly be thrown upon us by the progress of the\r\nwar, and as the direct result of the President's liberating\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nThe vital and momentous question of cotton production, manufacture, and\r\nexportation, is involved in this subject. Shall we continue to supply\r\nthe markets of the world with this indispensable commodity, the raw\r\nmaterial and the manufactured products; or shall we become importers of\r\nthe greatly inferior article from the East Indies at prices largely\r\nenhanced, with the consequent destruction of our manufactures and the\r\nloss of eight millions of exports of American goods with all the\r\nprospective increase of this important branch of the national industry?\r\nThe annihilation of the cotton trade in the United States would change\r\nthe face of the world. It would diminish the power and importance of our\r\ncountry among the nations to an incredible extent; and it would\r\nseriously affect the relations of other powers among themselves. The\r\nattitude of France and England toward us, at this moment, gives but a\r\nfaint indication of what we should suffer at their hands if the\r\norganization of labor at the South should be so utterly destroyed as to\r\nprevent the cultivation of the great staple which that favored region is\r\nso preëminently fitted to produce. It is the influence imparted by this\r\nproduction which the South has endeavored to use as its most formidable\r\nweapon, against us in this gigantic rebellion; and whatever countenance\r\nthe rebels have received, or hereafter expect to receive from abroad, is\r\nthe result solely of their command of this indispensable production. It\r\nis this which supplies them with arms and munitions of war at home, and\r\nwhich builds the piratical ships with which they prey upon our commerce\r\non the high seas. Indeed, but for this all-powerful product of their\r\nsoil and labor, stimulating them and their foreign allies with the hope\r\nof liberating the vast supplies now on hand, the war would, in all\r\nprobability, have been long since determined. But motives of still wider\r\nscope and bearing instigate the unfriendly acts of England and France.\r\nIt is a question with these powers, whether they shall hold the\r\nrebellious States by such obligations as shall make them a virtual\r\ndependency for their own advantage, as the record shows they attempted\r\nto do in the case of Texas in 1844; or whether these factious and\r\nambitious fragments of the Union shall be subdued by our own Government\r\nand brought back to their true allegiance, with the effect of\r\nreinstating our envied and dreaded power, and with our virtual monopoly\r\nof cotton confirmed and consolidated. It is easy to see how dazzling is\r\nthe temptation which induces England and France to play the false and\r\ndangerous part which they are so plainly acting, in this, the most\r\ncritical emergency which has arisen during the whole period of our\r\nnational existence. But the stake at issue, however valuable to them, is\r\nof infinitely greater importance to us.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely a question of philanthropy to the liberated negroes of\r\nour Southern section; nor do we approach the limits of the subject, when\r\nwe show how deeply the wealth and power of our country and its\r\ncommercial greatness are involved in it. There are other questions of\r\nstill greater importance necessarily arising out of it, and they concern\r\nthe rights and interests of the people of the loyal States, especially\r\nof the great mass of laboring white men, in every part of the country,\r\nNorth, South, East, and West. Destroy the labor of the South, cut off\r\nits cotton crops, and a fatal blow will be struck at the commerce and\r\nmanufactures of the whole country. Every other branch of industry,\r\nthroughout all its minutest ramifications, will feel the shock and\r\nlanguish accordingly. If, instead of using our fine Southern cotton at\r\nten cents per pound, we are compelled to go to a distance of ten or\r\ntwelve thousand miles, paying fifty or sixty cents for the inferior,\r\ncoarse, short-staple production of India, it is apparent that the whole\r\nfabric of our prosperity would be prostrated, and remain so, until\r\nindustry and commerce should find new and profitable channels for their\r\nenterprise. Clothing would be greatly enhanced in value, and this, to\r\nthe laboring man, would be equivalent to a corresponding diminution of\r\nfood and all the other comforts of life. Cleanliness and health,\r\nnecessarily dependent on the abundance and cheapness of clothing, would\r\nbe to some extent affected; and, indeed, every interest of society, in\r\nall sections and among all classes, would suffer more or less from the\r\nsame causes. With the cotton production destroyed or materially injured,\r\nour means of paying the vast debt which the war will leave against us\r\nwould be seriously impaired, and the burden of taxation would be to that\r\nextent heavier and more intolerable to the masses of our people.\r\n\r\nThus this question of emancipation to the blacks is intimately connected\r\nwith that of justice to the whites. It involves in it all the most\r\nimportant considerations which combine to control the prosperity of a\r\npeople; for it affects taxation, employment, wages, clothing, food, and\r\nhealth, and, as a consequence necessarily resulting from these, the\r\nproper education of the working classes, and the cause of free\r\ngovernment itself. Nor is it without much weight and importance that the\r\ngreater part of these effects extend beyond the limits of our own\r\ncountry and affect similarly, and, in some instances, even more\r\nseverely, the laboring classes of other countries. We ought not to\r\nforget the steady heroism and noble self-respect with which, in some\r\nparts of England, the middle and working classes of the people, in the\r\nmidst of great sufferings, and in spite of them, have justly appreciated\r\nour cause and have defended it against the selfish, sinister attacks of\r\naristocratic enemies--their own would-be leaders and instructors. To\r\nthese disinterested friends and sympathizers in our mighty struggle we\r\nowe at least a grateful recognition; and it becomes us to do every thing\r\nin our power to alleviate and shorten the sufferings which the rebellion\r\nhas brought on them in common with ourselves. No wild, inconsiderate,\r\nand destructive schemes, in the guise of philanthropy, should receive\r\nour assent or command our support. The crisis demands some wise,\r\npractical, and efficient measure for the organization of the labor of\r\nthe freed negroes in the profitable and important occupations to which\r\nthey have mostly been accustomed.\r\n\r\nEvents are rapidly maturing their results, and developing the occasion\r\nfor the direct interference of our Government through its legislative\r\ndepartment. There is no time to be lost. Instant action is demanded.\r\nCongress ought to take up the subject, without delay, immediately after\r\nits meeting, and never cease the investigation until some proper measure\r\nshall have been matured and adopted. The great fact must be recognized\r\nthat the Southern slaves will have been liberated by the agency of the\r\nGovernment, as a means of suppressing the rebellion, by taking away its\r\nchief cause and its most powerful support. These unfortunate men, placed\r\nin their peculiar condition by no fault of their own, must necessarily\r\nreceive the protection and become the wards of the Government. Some\r\nsystem of apprenticeship ought to be adopted, and rules and regulations\r\nestablished by law for their government, education, and employment. They\r\nought to be employed in cultivating the soil of their native States for\r\nthe production of cotton and sugar, so that the former course of things\r\nmay be as little interrupted as possible, except in the altered\r\ncondition of the laborers. The lands which will fall into our possession\r\nought to be immediately prepared for cultivation, and the new system of\r\nfree labor put into practical operation at the earliest moment. The\r\nimprovement and education of the laborer ought to be considered quite as\r\ncarefully as the success and productiveness of his work. Our armies will\r\nbe able to give ample protection to the communities which may be\r\norganized under this arrangement; the lands, by the confiscation act,\r\nwill easily be made available to carry out the scheme; and, doubtless,\r\nany number of Union men will be found in all parts of the South, to\r\ncoöperate in this plan, by the inducement of a fair participation in its\r\nlegitimate profits. It will be easy to prevent the system from\r\ndegenerating so as to admit any of the old habits of slavery, or to\r\ntolerate any of its oppressions and inhuman practices. In the course of\r\ntime, the present slaveholders themselves, humbled and subdued, as we\r\nhope they soon will be, will find themselves compelled to acquiesce in\r\nthe policy of the Government, and, in the end, will acknowledge the\r\nwisdom of the proceeding which substitutes paid and educated labor for\r\nthat pernicious system of slavery which has blinded and deluded them to\r\ntheir own destruction. Eventually, though gradually, it may well be\r\nanticipated, white labor will be employed in the growth of cotton. The\r\nAfricans will find their advantage in removing farther south, perhaps to\r\nCentral America, possibly to Africa; and, before many years, the\r\nproductions of the teeming South will far surpass what they have been,\r\nor could be, under the reign of slavery.\r\n\r\nWe forbear to make any suggestion as to the details of the proposed\r\nsystem. The wisdom of Congress, aided by the experience and the advice\r\nof the Executive, will no doubt be sufficient for the great exigency.\r\nBut in any plan which may be adopted, certain general principles must\r\nobtain. They must look to these cardinal points: the actual and complete\r\nemancipation of the slave, and his education as far as possible; his\r\nsubordination to just and necessary, though humane laws which may be\r\nmade for his control; and, finally, the usefulness and productiveness of\r\nhis industry, with a fair proportion of the profits allowed to himself,\r\nin some proper form, for his own benefit and improvement. With these\r\npoints securely guarded, we may safely look to the future without much\r\ndread of that terrible confusion and disorganization which now threaten\r\nthe unhappy South. We may at least begin to plant the germs of a\r\nreorganization which will speedily bring back again order and\r\nprosperity, based on a better foundation than they have ever heretofore\r\nhad to rest upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one lives it--to\r\n     not many is it known; and, seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n'Love descends.' To be filial is a virtue. But who calls parental\r\naffection a virtue? 'Honor thy father and they mother.' It is commanded\r\nfrom Sinai. 'Love and cherish they children.'\r\n\r\nThe idea _is_ a melancholy one, that as we grow old, and more than ever\r\nrequire sympathy, our children, in the inevitable course of nature,\r\nbecome interested in their own surroundings, and less able to sympathize\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nJoel Burns was not, in the ordinary sense, growing old. He was in the\r\nvery flush and prime of his manhood. I have explained with what feeling\r\nand affection he regarded his daughter, and how his daughter regarded\r\nhim. But for Joel Burns is coming the hour of agony and trial. Reader,\r\nif perchance you begin to take some interest in this narrative, do not\r\nblame Sarah Burns. Could she oppose the _vis naturæ?_ Could she, if she\r\nwould, battle against that subtle and irresistible _leaven_ which now\r\nbegan to pervade her being? Indeed, she could not. And how unconscious\r\nshe was! How much more than ever she loved her father!--as she thought.\r\nPerhaps she did. For when a young girl first feels her soul charged\r\nwith this mysterious influence, how kindly and joyously and lovingly all\r\nare embraced!--father, mother, brothers, sisters, friends.\r\n\r\nSarah had only her father; and when her heart began to fructify and\r\nexpand, all her affections expanded with it. Not that her heart had, as\r\nyet, any object to rest on. By no means. But the time had come. There\r\nwas no resisting _it_, any more than resistance may be predicated of the\r\ngreen leaf, which _must_ put forth in the spring, bringing bud and\r\nflower and fruit after it. Yet, I repeat, Sarah Burns was unconscious,\r\nactually and absolutely unconscious. Do not suppose she cared specially\r\nabout Hiram Meeker. She did not. Her nature only was on the alert, not\r\nshe. Hiram, all things considered, was the most agreeable man she had\r\nmet, and why should she not be attracted by him--to an extent? I say\r\nattracted: I do not mean anything else. Why should she not be?\r\n\r\nJoel Burns, I cannot help pitying you. With no living being with whom\r\nyou can intimately sympathize, except your daughter--_her_ child, on\r\nwhom the affluence of your heart had all been shed! You feel\r\ninstinctively the real state of things. And you quite understand it. You\r\nknew it was to be. But you hoped, not quite so soon--not _quite_ so\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, reader, I may not echo your own sentiments, when I speak of\r\nJoel Burns. But I love a genuine nature, as his. I admire beyond\r\nexpression honesty of _soul_--that honesty which will not think of\r\nitself nor seek to have others think of it different from what it really\r\nis.\r\n\r\nYes, I feel sorry for Joel Burns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Burns, as I have already observed, took the papers which Hiram put\r\nin his hands, in the belief they contained little to satisfy or\r\nencourage him. While his confidential clerk was absent, he had permitted\r\nhis mind to dwell on the 'unfortunate affair' more than was his habit in\r\nrelation to any matter of business. This, however, was assuming such\r\nugly proportions, that he could not avoid it. Sarah also could not help\r\ntalking about it. So that Hiram's arrival served to terminate a suspense\r\nwhich had become painful.\r\n\r\nSarah Burns, after receiving Hiram's response to her question (she\r\nthought and cared only for the single word 'won'), ran joyfully into the\r\nroom to congratulate her father and get full particulars. She was\r\nsurprised to find him seated at the breakfast table, the bundle of\r\npapers laid aside untouched, while his countenance certainly gave no\r\nindication that he had just received agreeable intelligence.\r\n\r\n'Why, father, how grave you look! What is the matter?'\r\n\r\n'I did not know I looked specially grave. I suppose I am a little\r\ndisappointed at Meeker's returning so soon. I find that, without knowing\r\nit, I had calculated too much on his efforts.'\r\n\r\n'Has he told you what he has done?'\r\n\r\n'No. He merely handed me those papers, and said they explained all. I\r\nsaw by his countenance, however, he had accomplished nothing of\r\nconsequence. [The fact is, Hiram, desiring to make the surprise as\r\ncomplete as possible, did exhibit the air of one returning from an\r\nunsuccessful mission.] 'So let us enjoy our breakfast before I go again\r\ninto this miserable business.'\r\n\r\n'Now, to please me, father, just take a peep at the papers; perhaps it\r\nis better than you fear.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Oh, please do,' and she put the bundle in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns untied the string. 'What have we here? _Joel Burns_ vs. _Elihu\r\nJoslin_. The fellow has involved me in a lawsuit to begin with. I had\r\nmuch better have agreed to his account--much better,' he added, almost\r\npettishly. 'I ought to have gone myself at any sacrifice.'\r\n\r\nSarah had unconsiously taken the papers from her father's hand, and was\r\nturning them over. Hiram's assurance still rang in her ears.\r\n\r\n'Here is something, father,' handing him a document marked _account\r\ncurrent_; 'and here something else,' exhibiting another, indorsed _Elihu\r\nJoslin with Joel Burns--Agreement to sell Paper Mill_.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns took both, and was instantly engaged in ascertaining their\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nSarah stood by, waiting--and I must say, confidently waiting--the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns's mind was, as the reader knows, rapid in its movements. He\r\ncomprehended the _account_ at a glance; then he looked at Joslin's\r\nagreement to sell. That was brief and to the point. Mr. Burns read every\r\nword of it.\r\n\r\n'It is not possible!' he exclaimed, as he finished the perusal. 'I\r\ndeclare I can't think it possible.'\r\n\r\n'What is it, father? Do tell me. What is it?'\r\n\r\n'Why. Meeker has gone to New York, and in forty-eight hours has not only\r\nbrought Joslin to a just settlement, but got from him a contract to sell\r\nme his half of the paper mill at a most reasonable price.'\r\n\r\n'Good, good. Oh, how rejoiced I am!' and she threw her arms around her\r\nfather's neck, and kissed him ever so many times. 'Oh, how glad I am. I\r\nnever saw anything worry you before, father, and it's all over now.'\r\n\r\n'A most extraordinary young man,' continued Mr. Burns, taking up the law\r\npapers. 'I see what he wanted the power of attorney for, now. A most\r\nextraordinary young man. It don't seem possible. Why, he brings Joslin\r\nin debt to me several thousand dollars!'\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to describe the sensations of Sarah Burns while her\r\nfather was giving expression to his own feelings. Joy that all cause of\r\nannoyance and trouble was removed from him; pleasure that this young man\r\nin particular had been the instrument; some slight fluttering at the\r\nrecollection of her promise, and of the triumphant boldness with which\r\nHiram had said 'Won,' as if he meant--as he _did_ mean--that something\r\nmore than her father's case _had_ been won--something much more;\r\nadmiration, too, of Hiram's cleverness, capacity, tact--such admiration\r\nas the sex always bestow on real ability. All these, commingled served\r\nto produce in Sarah Burns a state of feeling--I should rather say of\r\n_being_--different from what she ever before experienced.\r\n\r\n'Come! now for some breakfast,' said Mr. Burns. 'Everything will be\r\ncold. Never mind, we can afford a cold breakfast on such news as this. I\r\nam sorry I had not pressed Meeker to stay, but I thought he was anxious\r\nto get away. He is an odd fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Why, he had been to breakfast, father.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but one would suppose he would have run directly here, and said,\r\nin a word, how successful he was. He is very odd.\r\n\r\n'I think, father, we may excuse his oddity for once.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed we may.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns rapidly finished, and hastened to the office.\r\n\r\nHe found Hiram at work at his desk on the ordinary business, which had\r\naccumulated in his absence, apparently as calm and unconcerned as if he\r\nhad not been absent.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns seized his hand, and thanked him for his admirable\r\nachievement, with all the ardor and sincerity of his enthusiastic and\r\nhonest nature. Hiram was undisturbed by it. His cold, clammy palm rested\r\nin the vigorous, cordial grasp of his employer unresponsive and\r\nunsympathizing. But Mr. Burns was in too happy and active a mood himself\r\nto be affected by that of his clerk. For the time, his was the ruling\r\ninfluence; and Hiram was the one insensibly to yield.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns asked so many questions that at last he got the particulars\r\nfrom Hiram, which naturally he very much enjoyed. These particulars were\r\nrecounted with modesty, without the slightest exhibition of egotism or\r\nconceit.\r\n\r\n'I cannot sufficiently thank you, Meeker,' said Mr. Burns, 'and I hope\r\nto show you some time how much I appreciate what you have done for me.'\r\n\r\n'To have done my duty,' replied Hiram, 'is my chief satisfaction; but to\r\nmerit your approbation is, I confess, a very great happiness.'\r\n\r\nHiram was invited to tea that evening. It happened Mr. Burns was obliged\r\nto go out shortly after. I do not suppose, on this particular occasion,\r\nthat Sarah regretted it. I am sure Hiram did not. For no sooner were\r\nthey alone together, than Miss Burns, almost with the air and tone of\r\nclose intimacy, so much was she carried away with the subject (women are\r\nsuch enthusiasts, you know), exclaimed, while she unconsciously moved\r\nher chair near Hiram:\r\n\r\n'Now, Mr. Meeker, I want you to tell me all about your journey to New\r\nYork. I insist on having every particular. I so anxious to know how it\r\nwas you compelled that dishonest wretch to do just what you asked of\r\nhim. Father says you dictated your own terms. Now for the secret of your\r\npower.'\r\n\r\n'It was my persuasive manner of showing how much better an honest course\r\nis than a knavish one,' said Hiram, smiling.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, I dare say; but tell me what I want to know. You think,\r\nperhaps, I don't understand business sufficiently to comprehend you; but\r\nyou are quite mistaken.'\r\n\r\nWe have all read how, by her own account, Desdemona was won. And her\r\nhistory gives proof, if we had no other, of the great dramatist's\r\nwonderful knowledge of the springs of human action and affection.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Hiram played Othello's part to perfection. After much\r\npersuasion he was induced to give, in a modest, but graphic way, a\r\ncomplete account of his trip to New York, with which the reader is\r\nalready familiar. Before he had concluded, Sarah Burns's appreciation\r\nwas at the highest pitch. And when, after a little, he took up his hat\r\nto leave(he preferred to do so before Mr. Burns returned), he did not\r\nappear to notice Sarah's heightened color and unequivocal look of\r\nadmiration, but bowed himself quietly out, without even taking her hand\r\n(he knew it was not Louisa or Charlotte Hawkins he was dealing with),\r\nbut nevertheless with a low, friendly, almost confidential, yet quite\r\ncareless 'good night' on his lips. But how all aglow he was,\r\nnevertheless, as he walked away from the house!--walked away without\r\nturning at the gate to salute Sarah again, though she stood on the\r\npiazza expecting it.\r\n\r\nAt this time many humanizing emotions filled the soul of Hiram Meeker.\r\nHe could not for the moment resist the genuine a spirit as that of Sarah\r\nBurns shed even over _his_ nature.\r\n\r\n'Well--well--she is a glorious creation; and--she--loves--me.'\r\n\r\nHe stopped; his pulse beat quick; he was very near the corner where they\r\nhad met when Sarah failed to recognize him.\r\n\r\n'She would not cut me now--not quite,' he added, in the old tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid she love him? My heart aches when I ask the question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Burns stood for several minutes on the piazza after Hiram went\r\naway. Presently her father came up.\r\n\r\n'Why, my daughter, are you here? Has Meeker left? It is early yet.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he went some little time ago. I got the whole story out of him;\r\nand when he finished he ran off, because I made him talk so much, I\r\nfear.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns observed that his daughter was somewhat excited; but there was\r\ngood reason, and he did not feel in any mood for scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps the first time in her life, however, _she_ felt conscious of\r\nsomething like _heart vacancy_--of some void her father's presence did\r\nnot fill. This made her very unhappy. She strove to conceal it, and\r\nprobably succeeded.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life, her father's kiss did not soothe,\r\ncomfort, and satisfy her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Joel Burns had finished his devotions (his daughter and he\r\nknelt always, morning and evening, side by side, and sent up their joint\r\nsupplications to the Almighty), Sarah hastened to her room. She slept\r\nlittle that night; but when she rose in the morning, after having\r\nbreathed forth her prayers to God, in whom she so implicitly put her\r\ntrust, she felt composed and happy, and ready to welcome her father and\r\nreceive his usual caress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have no design to occupy too much of this narrative with the present\r\nsubject. I am writing the history of Hiram Meeker--not of Sarah Burns.\r\nAnd Hiram's 'little affair' with Sarah, as he used to call it, was\r\nscarcely an episode in his life.\r\n\r\nThe reader can easily understand how quietly, and with a manner both\r\nfascinating and insinuating, Hiram installed himself absolutely in the\r\naffections of Sarah Burns.\r\n\r\nMark you, Sarah was not a girl to be treated like Mary Jessup, or the\r\nHawkinses, or many others with whom Hiram was or had been a favorite.\r\nHiram knew this magnetically, and he undertook no false moves--assumed\r\nno petty freedoms; but he knew how to make such a true-hearted girl love\r\nhim, and he succeeded.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Hiram was ready to give up his life-project of\r\nsettling in New York. There were times when, even arguing, as he could\r\nonly argue, from his selfishness, he was ready to decide to marry Sarah\r\nand down in Burnsville. He would have a large field there. He would\r\nstart with abundant capital; he would go on and introduce various\r\nimprovements and multiply plans and enterprises. Then the recollection\r\nof the vast city, teeming with facilities for his active brain to take\r\nadvantage of, where MILLIONS were to be commanded, with no limits, no\r\nbounds for action and enterprise, would bring him back to his\r\ndetermination not to swerve from his settled object.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, he could get only so near to Sarah Burns. He knew she\r\nadmired him--loved him--at least, was ready to love him; but this did\r\nnot bring him into close communion with her.\r\n\r\nAfter that morning, Sarah's state of mind and heart was at least\r\ntranquil. She possessed the true talisman; and it would have been in\r\nvain for Hiram to attempt to disturb her repose. As I have said, he\r\nunderstood this very well. He knew he could not trifle, or, as it is\r\ncalled, flirt with Sarah; and he did not try. But after a while he was\r\npiqued--then he did admire Sarah more than any girl he ever met.\r\nProbably he loved her as much as he was capable of loving; which\r\nwas--not at all.\r\n\r\nAt last, just after the conclusion of some brilliant operations, as\r\nHiram called them, of Mr. Burns's, on a lovely day in the summer, when\r\nnature was in her glory and all things were very beautiful at\r\nBurnsville, Hiram--(I won't say he designed to be false, I have many\r\ndoubts on that head, and he is entitled to the benefit of them)--Hiram,\r\nI say, encountered Sarah Burns a little out of the village, on a\r\nromantic path, which he sometimes used as a cross cut to the mill.\r\nAffairs were very flourishing--the place full of activity; Joel Burns\r\nquite a king and general benefactor there; and Sarah Burns--a charming,\r\nvery charming girl --his only daughter.\r\n\r\nHiram came suddenly on her. Both stopped, of course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Burns that day wondered--wondered exceedingly that the tried and\r\nreliable Meeker should fail him on a very important occasion. Something\r\nmade it necessary that Hiram should visit Slab City, and return in the\r\ncourse of the morning. But the morning passed, and no Hiram. Mr. Burns\r\ndrove to the mill: his clerk had not appeared there.\r\n\r\nAt dinner time the mystery was solved. Hiram, it seems, had been unable\r\nto resist all the conspiring influences. When they met, the two had\r\nwandered away toward a pleasant grove, and, seated at the foot of a\r\ngiant oak, he told Sarah Burns in most seductive terms how he loved her,\r\nhow he had always loved her since they met at Mrs. Croft's.\r\n\r\nSarah did as young girls always do: she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThis was not at all to Hiram's taste.\r\n\r\n(Don't be severe with him, reader: he could not appreciate the causes\r\nwhich produce such emotions.)\r\n\r\nHe waited for what he was cool enough to consider hysterical\r\ndemonstrations to pass, and commenced again to press his suit.\r\n\r\n'My father, my father!' exclaimed Sarah; 'I can never give him up.'\r\n\r\n'We must leave father and mother, and cleave to each other,' said Hiram\r\nsolemnly, with anything rather than the tone of a lover. It sounded\r\nharsh and repulsive to Sarah, and she began to cry, again, but not as\r\npassionately as before.\r\n\r\n(Hiram was dissatisfied, selfish ever, he disliked exceedingly that she\r\nshould think of her father at such a time.)\r\n\r\n'I know it,' she finally said, 'and that is why I speak. Whatever may be\r\nmy feelings, I shall never forget my duty to him.'\r\n\r\n'And how will loving me interfere with it?' asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Whatever may be the consequence to me, I will never leave him. And\r\nyou--your plans take you elsewhere. I know it very well.'\r\n\r\nHiram was surprised, he could not imagine how his secret purposes could\r\nhave been discovered, for he had never divulged them.\r\n\r\n'_You_ know it, too,' she continued, perceiving he was silent.\r\n\r\n'That may he,' he replied; ' but that does not prevent my loving you.\r\nAnd who knows? Perhaps your father will not care to remain, always at\r\nBurnsville.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he will never leave it; that I am sure of,' said Sarah, almost\r\nsorrowfully, 'And I shall stay with him.'\r\n\r\n'Then you do not love me,' said Hiram, in a tone not quite amiable.\r\n\r\n'You know better,' exclaimed Sarah, her eyes flashing, and all the\r\nspirit of her father beaming forth. 'Hiram Meeker, you know better!'\r\n\r\nShe was superb in her passion. Something besides affection shone forth\r\nnow, and Hiram was led captive by _it_.\r\n\r\n'Then shall I stay,' he said resolutely. 'Take me or not, Sarah, I stay,\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was not altogether surprised at the announcement which awaited\r\nhim on going home that day to dinner. He had seen for some time that his\r\ndaughter was much interested, and he thought Hiram equally so.\r\n\r\nIt is true the old feeling continued, and there were times when, it\r\nappeared to break forth stronger than ever. Mr. Burns had made up his\r\nmind that it was doing Hiram great injustice to yield to it, since the\r\nyoung man was untiring in the discharge of his duties, and also most\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nSo he had endeavored to accustom himself to think of the event of his\r\ndaughter's engagement with Hiram as very probable. What could possibly\r\nbe urged against it? Hiram was of respectable family, possessed of\r\nextraordinary business ability, bearing an irreproachable character,\r\nreally without a fault that could be indicated, and a consistent member\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\nYes, that was so. And, looking it over carefully, Mr. Burns used\r\nfrequently to admit to himself that it _was_ so. What then? Why, then\r\nJoel Burns would sigh and feel heaviness of heart, he scarcely knew why,\r\nand think to himself that there could remain for him no happiness should\r\nSarah marry Meeker. Then he would ask himself, how his wife would have\r\nliked Meeker. He did not think she would have liked him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as I have said, Mr. Barns decided the event was coming,\r\nand that he could not say nay.\r\n\r\nAnd he did not say nay. He said very little; but when Sarah threw\r\nherself in her father's arms, and he kissed her forehead, his heart was\r\nnigh to bursting. He restrained his emotion, though.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'We are never to leave you, father. You know that, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'My child, no one knows the future; but I am happy that you will live\r\nwith me.'\r\n\r\nHiram said nothing. Already his old caution was returning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected, when Hiram first came to Burnsville he sought to\r\nbe admitted as a member of Mr. Burns's family, but was met with a cold\r\nand abrupt refusal. Now, Mr. Burns not only desired Hiram to come at\r\nonce to his house, but put his wishes in so decided a form that Hiram\r\ncould not object. It was in vain, that Sarah interposed. She begged her\r\nfather not to insist on the arrangement. Neither had Hiram the least\r\ndesire to quit his comfortable quarters at the widow Hawkins's, even for\r\nthe sake of being near the one to whom he had pledged himself forever.\r\nBut he did not dare betray himself. He did betray himself though,\r\nunconsciously, by the absence of any enthusiasm on a point where one\r\nwould suppose he would exhibit a great deal. Mr. Burns had a single\r\nobject in having Hiram near him. His daughter's happiness was most\r\nprecious to him, and he resolved to make himself acquainted with the\r\nyoung man's character, if it were possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Hiram began to call at the house of Mr. Burns, he\r\ngradually extended his visits over the village, and became a greater\r\nfavorite than ever with the ladies. Not with the young girls alone, but\r\nwith elderly spinsters and matrons. Strange how he managed so completely\r\nto make them all like him! His position with Mr. Barns grew more and\r\nmore into consequence, so that he was regarded as unquestionably the\r\nbest match in the place. When Hiram at last removed from the widow\r\nHawkins's to Mr. Burns's, the village was for a few days the focus of\r\nall sorts of guesses and surmises. Mr. Burns had enjoined on both that\r\nthe engagement should not be made public at present--an arrangement\r\nparticularly pleasing to Hiram, who would thus be quite at liberty to\r\ngive what turn he pleased to the subject, and not forfeit the favor of\r\nseveral young ladies already too deeply interested in him.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, when Hiram announced his intended removal to Mrs.\r\nHawkins, that lady was exceedingly surprised, not to say overcome.\r\nHiram, however, coupled the information with such an air of grave\r\nimportance, dropping a few words about the enormous increase of Mr.\r\nBurns's business, and the absolute necessity of frequent evening\r\nconsultations, that she was completely disarmed. Then he remarked that\r\nhis leaving the house would by no means cause any diminution of his\r\ninterest in the young ladies, or in _her;_ indeed, quite the contrary.\r\nSuch interest must increase daily, the more so that he should not have\r\nthe pleasure of so openly manifesting it. The widow blushed, she hardly\r\nknew why. Hiram squeezed her hand tenderly, and sought out Charlotte and\r\nLouisa. Charlotte was in the garden, and--I must tell the truth--Louisa\r\nin her chamber, crying. All this was charming to Hiram. He luxuriated in\r\nit (though in a more delicious degree), as over a nice steak or a\r\ndelicate boiled chicken.\r\n\r\nHiram's interview with both the young ladies was, as you may readily\r\nimagine, perfectly satisfactory to both. In short, when he quitted the\r\nhouse, all were content and hopeful, and all from different reasons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was now that Joel Burns sat himself down to investigate the cause of\r\nthose strange sensations which he at times experienced in the presence\r\nof Meeker. The first time Hiram came to the table, not as a guest, but\r\nas an inmate of the house, nothing could have been more stiff and formal\r\nthan the conduct of all three. In vain. Mr. Burns endeavored to appear\r\nfree. The spell was on him; and there sat the one who alone could cause\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJoel Burns looked at his daughter. She appeared diffident and not at\r\nease, but, as he thought, happy. Hiram sat still, saying nothing and\r\nlooking quite vacant. He was determined not to exhibit any points till\r\nhe knew his ground better.\r\n\r\nIn the office, though, all was right. There he entered into, nay,\r\nanticipated Mr. Burns's plans, and he could not fail to evoke his\r\nemployer's admiration.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Joel Burns's daily devotions; how, with his child, he\r\nwas in the habit of coming before his Maker, bringing the offerings of\r\ntheir joint hearts. For two or three days after Meeker came to the house\r\nthis custom was continued. Then Sarah gently asked her father if Hiram\r\nmight not be admitted. (He had complained to her that it was not\r\nChristian-like to exclude him.) A shiver passed over Mr. Burns; a groan\r\nalmost escaped his lips. How fast the links were giving way which kept\r\nhis daughter with him! But the request was quite right, and that night\r\nHiram was present at the evening prayer. Sarah, on that occasion, did\r\nnot sit so near her father as usual. And when they kneeled, her chair\r\nwas still more removed. So it went on. Sarah, like all who love,\r\ninvested Hiram with every virtue in perfection (and lovers are more\r\nindebted for virtues to the imagination of the sex than they suppose),\r\nand was very happy. Hiram, who managed, under the excuse of not\r\npermitting the public to learn the secret of their engagement, to visit\r\nnearly as much as ever, was happy enough too. Only Joel Burns was sad.\r\nSad, not because he had given away his daughter, but because he feared\r\nfor her happiness.\r\n\r\nWhat was strange enough, Mr. Burns could not endure to hear Hiram speak\r\non religion, and Hiram was very fond of talking on the subject. He spoke\r\nso well, every one said. He exhibited so many evidences of divine grace.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Sarah came into her father's room, and, after kissing him,\r\nsaid, with a great deal of diffidence:\r\n\r\n'Father, I want to ask a favor of you.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, my child. What is it?'\r\n\r\n'Won't you please ask Hiram sometimes to lead in prayer?'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns started as if stung by some reptile. He turned very pale.\r\n\r\n'What is the matter--what _is_ the matter, father? How pale you\r\nlook--how very pale you look!'\r\n\r\n'Do I? I felt strangely, just at that moment. Yes, dear child, I will do\r\nwhat you request. I suppose I ought to have done so before; but then,\r\nyou know, it is hard to--yes, dear--I will do as you wish.'\r\n\r\nSarah left the room, wondering not a little, and Joel Burns threw\r\nhimself on the bed and sobbed.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he recovered his composure. Kneeling at the side of the\r\nbed, he ejaculated: '_O God, help me to feel right! and, O Heavenly\r\nFather, protect my child!_'\r\n\r\nThat day, after breakfast, Hiram was asked to make the morning prayer.\r\n\r\nShall I attempt to describe his ready utterance; his glib use of the\r\nmost sacred expressions; his familiar handling of God's name?\r\n\r\nMr. Burns's feelings meanwhile cannot be described. In his presence, at\r\nleast to his true apprehension, Hiram Meeker was like the Arch Enemy\r\nwhen touched by the spear of Ithuriel. And yet Joel Burns kneeled,\r\ntrying humbly to commit his soul to God, while Hiram was pouring out\r\nwhat he thought to be a most beautiful prayer!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go on with particulars. Every two or three\r\nmonths Hiram found it for Mr. Burns's interest to visit New York. More\r\nand more he became confirmed in his first determination to ultimately\r\nsettle there. He kept his views entirely to himself. But he did not\r\nneglect his opportunities whenever he visited the city, till at length\r\nhis plans were matured.\r\n\r\nThen, by degrees, he sounded Sarah Burns on the subject. He would\r\nsuggest that it was best, perhaps, in order better to serve the\r\ninterests of her father, that he should acquire more knowledge of\r\nmetropolitan affairs, so that there need be again no danger of another\r\nJoslin matter. Sarah exhibited so much distress on these occasions that\r\nHiram forbore to allude to the subject. He perfected his plans, and said\r\nnothing about them.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of his purpose that these plans should leak out somewhat;\r\nsufficiently, at least, to set people discussing their probability; and\r\nhe took measures accordingly. This accounts for the division of opinion\r\nin the village, which I spoke of in the first chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur story opens at this period.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker and Sarah Burns had gone in company to attend the\r\npreparatory lecture on the Friday prior to Communion. At that lecture\r\nSarah heard, for the first time, that Hiram had decided to leave for New\r\nYork. The reader may possibly recollect the conversation between them as\r\nthey left the lecture room.\r\n\r\nI said, though Sarah Burns could not disbelieve Hiram, her heart _felt_\r\nthe lie he told her nevertheless.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was also present on that occasion. Shall I say it? A thrill of\r\njoy shot through him at the announcement; joy, if it must be spoken,\r\nthat Hiram had proved a dissembler and a hypocrite. His year would\r\nexpire the coming week. Not a syllable had he said on the subject to Mr.\r\nBurns, and he had concluded on this method of acquainting both Mr. Burns\r\nand Sarah of his fixed determination.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the walk was measured in silence. Some faint\r\nperception of the truth was beginning to dawn in Sarah's mind. Her\r\nfather's spirit began to assert itself in her breast.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns walked slowly along a little behind. It was tea time when they\r\nentered the house. He went for a moment to his room. He had scarcely\r\nentered it, when the door opened and his daughter came in. She ran up to\r\nher father; she threw her arms around his neck; and while she wept\r\nbitterly, Joel Burns could hear between the sobs:\r\n\r\n'_Oh, father, father, your child has come back to you!_'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL RIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Little lady wants a President all smile and style and grace;\r\n   Little master wants a Talleyrand or Crichton in the place;\r\n   Little simpletons want this and that to fill the nation's chair;\r\n   But the times want ABRAHAM LINCOLN--and, thank GOD, they have him there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nOur large debt and vast expenditures demand a resort to every just\r\navailable source of national revenue. Among these are our mineral lands\r\nof the public domain, and especially those yielding gold and silver. On\r\nthis subject, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, Judge\r\nEdmunds, on the 16th of April last, addressed a letter to the Committee\r\nof Public Lands of the Senate, from which I make the following extract:\r\n\r\n     'For a half century prior to the California gold discoveries in\r\n     1848, the annual gold yield of the world was, by estimate, from\r\n     sixteen to twenty millions of dollars, of which Russia produced\r\n     more than one half. In 1853 the gold product of California was\r\n     $70,000,000. * * * * Annual yield, estimating upon reported\r\n     shipments, was $50,000,000, to which by adding two fifths for\r\n     quantity taken by private hands, besides that converted into\r\n     articles of ornament and use, the total average would be seventy\r\n     millions a year. The immense discoveries of gold, silver,\r\n     quicksilver, tin, copper, lead, iron, and coal, within our limits,\r\n     justify the estimate that our mineral riches exceed the aggregate\r\n     metallic wealth of the globe. In a state of peace, with adequate\r\n     revenue from ordinary sources, the Government has interposed no\r\n     obstacle to the free access of our citizens and of the people of\r\n     every nation, to work the mines, of which the United States are the\r\n     undisputed owners, and by which individuals, in the aggregate, have\r\n     realized some nine hundred millions of dollars.'\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, therefore, very justly concludes that, under existing\r\ncircumstances, our mineral lands ought to yield a national revenue, and\r\nhe proposes a preliminary reconnoissance, and licenses, at $10 each, to\r\nbe paid in the mean time by the miners to the Government. Beyond these\r\nsuggestions he proceeds at present no farther.\r\n\r\nThe general estimate of the extent of our mineral lands of the public\r\ndomain, exceeds twenty millions of acres. It extends from near the 32d\r\nto the 49th parallel of latitude, and from the lakes and the Mississippi\r\nriver to the Pacific. It is not supposed that every acre of these twenty\r\nmillions contains mines, but that all are so connected as to be embraced\r\nin the same mineral region. These lands, at an average price of $25 per\r\nacre, would be worth $500,000,000. I do not assert that this is their\r\nvalue, but it is a fact that some of the mines already worked on our\r\npublic domain are worth many thousand dollars _per foot_, even in the\r\npresent difficulty of access by roads, and the enormous cost of\r\nprovisions. It is sufficient for the argument that these mines and\r\nmineral lands are of great value, that they are public property, and, in\r\nthe present condition of our country, ought to be made a source of\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThis question concerns the present and future miners. As to the present\r\nminers, they are working these lands without any legal title, but by the\r\nlong acquiescence of the Government. They are the pioneers, who, amid\r\ngreat dangers, privations, and sufferings, have explored these mineral\r\nregions and developed their enormous value. As regards these pioneers\r\nnow working the mineral lands of the Government, I think, as a general\r\nrule, the existing miners' code should be carried into effect. They\r\nshould be required to register their claims with the proper officer of\r\nthe Federal Government, to file copies and descriptive notes of their\r\nsurveys and locations, and to report the product of the mines. This\r\nwould form a good basis for the reconnoissance proposed by the\r\nCommissioner, and for the exploration and resurvey of these claims by\r\nthe Government. Such proceedings would effect the following results:\r\n1st. To prevent litigation among the present miners. 2d. To enable the\r\nGovernment to separate their lands from the public domain, and to give\r\nthem a _perfect title_. 3d. To survey and designate the unoccupied\r\nmineral lands of the Government. I think it would be just, and good\r\npolicy to confirm the rights of the present miners according to the\r\nexisting regulations in the several districts, charging them only a\r\nnominal price for a complete title and patent from the Government, which\r\nprice should not be more than the cost of survey and incidental\r\nexpenses, not exceeding a few cents an acre. This would greatly improve\r\nthe condition of the present miners, to whom we are indebted for the\r\ndevelopment of this region; would give them a perfect title, where now\r\nthey have none; and, in many cases, would enable them to raise the\r\ncapital necessary for the more profitable working of their mines.\r\n\r\nHaving thus surveyed and located the mines now worked by the present\r\noccupants, and secured to them their titles in fee simple, without rent,\r\nregie, or seigniorage, let us now consider the proper policy as to the\r\nvast unoccupied public mineral domain. The solution of this problem\r\ndivides itself into two parts: 1st, the survey and subdivision of these\r\nlands; 2d, the price and mode of sale.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, I would continue the present mode of surveys by\r\ntownships, sections, and quarter-quarter sections, with further\r\nsubdivisions thereof. It will be best, however, to adopt the _geodetic_\r\nsystem, for the following reasons: 1st, The errors in the linear surveys\r\nare much greater than in the geodetic, in nearly the ratio of yards to\r\ninches. These errors may not be very important as to sections, but, in\r\nthe minute subdivisions (an acre each) into which the mineral lands\r\nshould be separated, the errors of the lineal surveys could not be\r\ntolerated, and would introduce ruinous litigation as to the boundaries\r\nof valuable mines. 2d, The linear surveys give us a description only of\r\nthe exterior lines of each section; but the geodetic system would inform\r\nus of the interior, enable the Government to appraise every acre, to\r\ngive the proper maps, similar to those of the coast survey, and enable\r\nthe people to judge of the value of each acre. The additional cost of\r\nthe geodetic system would hardly reach two cents an acre.\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of the gold and silver lands, should be into tracts of\r\none acre each, continuing and extending the present system. This is by\r\ntownships of six miles square, containing 36 sections and 23,040 acres.\r\nEach section contains 640 acres; and to separate them into acres, the\r\nfollowing system should be adopted. The present subdivision is into\r\nquarter-quarter sections, of 40 acres each. These small tracts, by lines\r\nrunning through the centre, north and south, and east and west, I would\r\nsubdivide into four tracts, each containing ten acres. These ten-acre\r\ntracts, by a line running north and south through the centre, I would\r\ndivide into two equal tracts, each containing five acres; and each of\r\nthese five-acre tracts, by lines running east and west, into five\r\ntracts, each containing one acre. The exterior lines, running east and\r\nwest, of these one-acre tracts, would each be one hundred and ten yards\r\nlong (330 feet), and the two sides running north and south, would each\r\nhave a length of forty-four yards (132 feet). The form of the ten-acre\r\ntract and its subdivisions, would be as follows:\r\n\r\nTEN ACRES.\r\n\r\n      110 yards. 110 yards.\r\n   4  +---------+---------+ 4\r\n   4  |One acre.|One acre.| 4\r\n   y  +---------+---------+ y\r\n   a  |do.      |do.      | a\r\n   r  +---------+---------+ r\r\n   d  |do.      |do.      | d\r\n   s  +---------+---------+ s\r\n      |do.      |do.      |\r\n      +---------+---------+\r\n      |do.      |do.      |\r\n      +---------+---------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the only plan by which the sections can be subdivided into\r\ntracts of one acre each. Such subdivisions of sections into _squares_ of\r\none acre each is impossible; nor is it necessary, as, of the present\r\nsubdivisions, neither a half section nor an eighth of a section is\r\nsquare. Before the motion made by me in the Senate of the United States,\r\non the 31st of March, 1836, the sales were made by eighths of a section,\r\nan oblong figure, and not by forty-acre tracts.\r\n\r\nMany of the present miners' claims are smaller than an acre, but it is\r\nimpracticable to make more minute subdivisions. This plan would continue\r\nour present admirable system of surveys, and, to carry it out, as now\r\nproposed, we should only have to mark, by stone or iron monuments, the\r\nnorth and south exterior lines of each section at intervals of\r\nforty-four yards, and the east and west lines at distances of one\r\nhundred and ten yards, and the survey would be complete, extending from\r\nsection to section, and from township to township. Having devoted great\r\nattention to such subjects, as chairman for many years of the Committee\r\nof Public Lands of the Senate, and as Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nhaving, in early life, made many surveys in the field, I venture, with\r\ngreat deference, to submit these suggestions for the consideration of\r\nthe President, the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office, Congress, and the country.\r\n\r\nTho system proposed by me would bring here vast foreign capital to\r\ninvest in working our mines. As the law now stands, no title can be\r\nacquired to any of our public mineral lands, and hence the capital\r\ninvested is extremely limited. By this plan, not only would a certain\r\ntitle be acquired to the mines now worked, and at a nominal price to the\r\npresent miners, but also for new mines, at their proper value, and thus\r\nour vast mineral wealth would be developed much sooner.\r\n\r\nThere are two considerations which will soon rapidly enhance the value\r\nof our mineral lands. These are the Homestead bill and the Pacific\r\nrailroad. By the gift, substantially, of one hundred and sixty acres of\r\nour agricultural public lands to every settler, the soil, in the\r\nvicinity of the mines, will be far more speedily occupied and\r\ncultivated, and, as a consequence, much cheaper provisions and\r\nsubsistence furnished to the miners. This result, also, will be greatly\r\naccelerated by the construction of the Pacific railroad, together with\r\nmuch lower transportation of emigrants and freight.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed (as it ought to be) is just to the mining States and\r\nTerritories, and to the pioneer miners. Indeed, it is far better for\r\nthem than the present system.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, how should the sales be made, and at what price.\r\nThe gold and silver lands I would sell in one-acre lots, as above\r\ndesignated; our other mineral lands in forty-acre lots, a subdivision\r\nnow recognized by law.\r\n\r\nOne surveyor, accompanied by one commissioner for each four townships,\r\nshould examine, and both should report to the register and receiver of\r\nthe proper land office, the value of each subdivision of the public\r\nmineral lands, together with the proper maps. These views should,\r\ntogether with their own opinions, be communicated by the register and\r\nreceiver to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, who, under the\r\nsupervision of the Secretary of the Interior, should fix the value of\r\nthese acre lots. These lands then should be advertised for sale to the\r\nhighest bidder for cash, at minimum rates, not below those estimated,\r\nwhich should be published. The bids, after six months' advertisement,\r\nshould be received by the register and receiver of the proper land\r\noffices, and also by the Secretary of the Interior, up to the same day\r\nand hour, when such bids should be at once opened simultaneously, and\r\nthe land awarded to the highest bidder above the minimum. To prevent\r\nfraud, no bid should be received unless accompanied by a deposit of one\r\nper cent. of the amount of the bid, to be forfeited to the Government\r\nonly if the bid is successful and the amount should not be paid in full.\r\nSuch tracts as are not sold at or above the appraised value should be\r\ndisposed if by _entry_ at the minimum price, in the same manner as under\r\nour former land system, subject at proper intervals to new appraisements\r\nand advertisements.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that our present Commissioner of the General Land Office\r\nestimates our mineral public lands as of greater value than all the\r\nmineral lands of the world, and that, up to the 16th of April last, they\r\nhad yielded, in gold alone, nine hundred millions of dollars. This is\r\nexclusive of our valuable mines silver, quicksilver, tin, copper, lead,\r\ncoal, and iron. The lands yielding this $900,000,000 are estimated at\r\nfive hundred thousand acres--making their value exceed one billion of\r\ndollars; and, at the same rate, the remaining twenty millions of acres\r\nwould be worth forty billions of dollars, or $2,000 per acre. This would\r\nbe a most extravagant estimate; but at the average price of twenty-five\r\ndollars per acre they would bring, as we have seen, five hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, being a sum larger than our public debt on the 1st\r\nof July last. That this sum at least can be realized to the Government\r\nby a proper system from our public mineral lands, is my sincere\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, the Commissioner says:\r\n\r\n     'As the development of the mineral wealth of the country advances\r\n     not only of the gold and silver of California, but of Oregon,\r\n     Washington, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the vast mines of\r\n     useful metals scattered there and elsewhere, with exhaustless\r\n     supplies of coal to fashion and mould these for the various\r\n     purposes of life, the yield in a few years may reasonably be\r\n     estimated at $100,000,000; and when the Pacific railroad shall have\r\n     spanned the interior, it may be augmented to one hundred and fifty\r\n     millions of dollars' worth of mineral product.'\r\n\r\nThis annual product, as estimated by the Commissioner, would make the\r\ntotal value of these lands exceed one billion of dollars.\r\n\r\nThere may be differences of opinion\r\n\r\nas to this estimate of the Commissioner: some may think it too large,\r\nand others too small; but, however this may be, it is quite clear that\r\nthe subject demands the earnest consideration of the country.\r\n\r\nNo period has been so auspicious as the present to rearrange our gold\r\ncoinage. Gold has ceased here to be a currency, and is used only in\r\npayment of our public debt and receipts of customs.\r\n\r\nIt is important that our gold coinage (retaining the decimal system) and\r\nthat of England should be assimilated. This could be easily done by\r\nhaving in our half eagle the same amount of gold and alloy as in the\r\nBritish sovereign, carrying the system through our whole gold coinage.\r\nThus, exchange here upon England or there here, would be quoted and\r\ngoverned by the same rules which regulate exchange between our own\r\ncities, and all the mystery and losses of our present system would\r\ndisappear. This change would slightly depreciate our present gold\r\ncoinage, but would not affect individual transactions, treasury notes\r\nbeing our currency and a legal tender. Should this plan be adopted,\r\nEngland could stamp on her sovereign, _Equal to a U. S. half eagle_, and\r\nwe could stamp on our half eagle, _Equal to a British sovereign_, and\r\nthus furnish a currency, which from necessity would in time be adopted\r\nby all the world, avoiding vast trouble, loss of time, and litigation,\r\nand saving millions of dollars every year. This measure would soon prove\r\nthe superiority of our decimal system, and render it _universal_. The\r\nUnited States and England being the two great commercial and gold\r\nproducing nations, speaking the same tongue, and having the same\r\ncoinage, would make the coin and the _language of the coin_ of the world\r\nthe same, the first great step toward a universal language. This\r\nassimilation of the value and language of coin would lead to the\r\ndecimalizing and assimilation of weights and measures, both grand\r\nmovements toward the fusion of nations and fraternity of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE NEW GYMNASTICS FOR MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN. By DIO LEWIS, M.D.\r\n     With three hundred illustrations. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nIt is with sincerest pleasure that we commend this excellent book to the\r\nattention of every teacher and parent in America. We might add that we\r\ncommend it as a gift book which would be most acceptable to youth, since\r\nit teaches them several hundred exercises, the greater portion of which\r\nrequire little or no apparatus, and none which cannot be very readily\r\nfitted up in almost any house. This book, moreover, includes a\r\ntranslation of Prof. KLOGS'S 'Dumb Bell Instructor' and Prof. SCHREBER'S\r\n'Pangymnastikon.' By the way, is this the same work of SCHREBER'S which\r\nwas translated some years ago by Prof. SEDGWICK, of New York, for his\r\nGymnastic Journal? We remember the latter as a work of solid merit,\r\nrecommending on sound anatomical principles the means of cure by\r\ngymnastics and calisthenics for many of the ills that flesh is heir to.\r\nWe ask, not remembering accurately, and from observing that Prof, LEWIS\r\nconfesses to having greatly abridged the volume in question, a plan\r\nnever to be commended in any translation whatever. But for the whole\r\nwork, with this exception, we have only praise. It is, we believe, the\r\nmost practical, sensible book and the one most easy of application on\r\nthis subject extant in any language. Let all interested remember that\r\nwhile it is indispensable to every gymnasium and every gymnast, its\r\nprice _is_ only one dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n     EYES AND EARS. By HENRY WARD BEECHER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n     1862. New York: G. P. Putnam. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe crisp, careless dozen and a half of lines which Mr. BEECHER snaps at\r\nhis readers by way of preface to this collection of papers, form the\r\nbest review of its contents which will probably be written. They came\r\nprincipally, as he informs us, from the New York _Ledger_, and partially\r\nfrom the _Independent_; were consequently written very much for the\r\nmany, and very little for the student of elaborate literature. They are\r\nunstudied, unpretentious--true _nugæ venales_, 'representing the\r\nimpressions of happy homes, or the moods and musings of the movement * *\r\nfragmentary and careless as even a newspaper style will permit.' But,\r\nbeyond this, we may assure the reader that these 'scintillant trifles'\r\nare knocked off from no second-rate material and by no awkward hand, but\r\nby one firm and confident in hasty and trivial efforts as in great ones,\r\nand producing the great even in the little. Many of these essay-lets\r\nhave a peculiar charm: they seem to crave expansion--we wish them\r\nlonger, and are as little pleased to find a fresh title whipping itself\r\nin before our eyes as children are at a rapidly managed magic-lantern\r\nshow, when the impatient exhibitor presents a View in Egypt to eyes\r\nwhich have hardly begun to take in Solomon's Temple. We like them far\r\nbetter than the majority of the more elaborate, infinitely conceited,\r\nnarrow-minded, squeakingly-witty essays with which the country has been\r\nof late visited for its sins from the Country Parson and his disciples.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SLAVERY IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THE EX-SLAVES; or, The Port Royal\r\n     Mission. By Mrs. A. M. FRENCH. New York: Winchell M. French, No. 5\r\n     Beekman street, 1862.\r\n\r\nNo one can write a book, however unpretentious, on the subject of\r\nslavery, and fill it with plain _facts_, without making a startling\r\nvolume. Take the subject up on the grounds of the barest humanity, even\r\nas one would the welfare of animals; laying aside all 'Abolition' or\r\nanti-abolition views whatever, and we find a tremendous abyss of abuses,\r\ninexcusable even according to the principles of the most rabid\r\npro-slavery disciple. Prominent among the facts which such a work as\r\nthe present presents, is the proof that the black, whatever his degree\r\nof intelligence may be, is abundantly capable, under enlightened\r\ndiscipline, of becoming infinitely more profitable to himself and to the\r\nworld than he has ever yet been. From the tales of distress, from the\r\nbewildering, sorrowful negro piety, from the jargon and rags and tears\r\nof poor childish contrabands, as simply and sadly set forth by Mrs.\r\nFRENCH, making every allowance, and penetrating to the depth of the dark\r\nproblem, we still realize one tremendous truth--that Slavery, as a\r\nprinciple of government, is a lie, and that from a politico-economical\r\npoint of view it has been a failure. It is a _waste of power_, and like\r\nevery waste of human power results in suffering.\r\n\r\nThe fifty-three chapters of the work before us present the results of\r\nthe Port Royal Mission, the truths gleaned from the contrabands of their\r\npast life, great additions to our Northern knowledge of the practical\r\ntreatment of slaves, many observations on these facts, and an array of\r\nInstances to prove the capacity of the negro. It will be spoken of as an\r\nAbolition work, and such it is; but we--who look beyond and above\r\nAbolition, and hold the higher doctrines of EMANCIPATION originally set\r\nforth in these columns--to the broad interests of humanity, and of the\r\nbenefit which is to accrue in the first place to the white race from\r\nfree labor--still commend it as full of material of the most valuable\r\ndescription to the great cause of progress.\r\n\r\nThe work is fairly printed, but, we regret to add, is disfigured by a\r\nmass of wretched woodcuts of the worst possible design, which look as if\r\nthey had been gleaned from old Abolition tracts, and which we trust will\r\nbe omitted from the next edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SALOME, THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS. A Dramatic Poem. New York;\r\n     Putnam, 532 Broadway.\r\n\r\nWhen we criticize ever so lightly any modern poetical treatment of an\r\nantique subject, we may as well premise that we do so as something which\r\nis only partially true, since few writers have ever so perfectly\r\npenetrated any foreign national spirit as to reproduce it--let us say,\r\nlike a translation. Even translations from the Greek are made\r\nMiltonically, or Pope-ishly, or Shakespearian-ally, and seldom with that\r\nracy literalness which characterizes Carlyle's occasional bits of German\r\npoetic version. Sometimes, as in the present instance, the old form is\r\nalmost unattainable, for Hebrew poetry and the modes of speech used at\r\nHerod's court are too little known in their first fresh life to be\r\nvividly reproduced. Consequently the more modern forms are\r\nindispensable. But, from the stand-point of English poetry, SALOME is a\r\nproduction of more than marked ability--it is a boldly conceived,\r\ngenially executed, oftentimes a truly superb poem. The repentance of\r\nSALOME has a broad lyrical and musical sweep which seems like an opera\r\nof grand passions when the trivial associations of the opera are\r\nforgotten. In the concluding scenes we seem to feel the inspiration of\r\nGOETHE and of ÆSCHYLUS, for the author has combined with rare tact the\r\nspirit of avenging fate with that of atonement--the Pagan and the\r\nChristian; and if the language be here and there meagre or lack\r\nconcentrativeness, we pardon it in consideration of the high idea by\r\nwhich plot, incident, and character are swayed. In one scene,\r\nhowever--the dialogue between Antonius and the Jew--we find a degree of\r\nhistoric truth, a reproduction in dramatic form of the sublime spirit of\r\nHebrew poetry, and an æsthetic color which, had it been maintained\r\nthroughout, would have neutralized our introductory remarks. This scene\r\nis of itself a real poem. Herodias is, we may add, consistent, and\r\nbravely accented in every thought and word; had she, however, been more\r\nconcise, she would have been more consistent to her earnestly malignant\r\nnature. 'But, then, Shakespeare exaggerated the monologue!'\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we commend SALOME cordially to all, for all can read it\r\nwith pleasure, and many, we may add, with profit. It belongs to a\r\nsoundly literary school, is disfigured with no extravagances, embodies\r\nmuch real beauty, and is above all a poem of promise of even better\r\nworks from its author.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIFE AND LETTERS OF WASHINGTON IRVING. Vol. 2. By his nephew,\r\n     PIERRE M. IRVING. New York: G. P. Putnam.\r\n\r\nLike the first volume, this admirable second leads us through one of the\r\nmost entertaining of _tutti frutti_ which we have ever met in the form\r\nof a biography. It is fortunate that IRVING--so generally imagined by\r\n'those of the second after-generation' as a quiet recluse on the banks\r\nof the Hudson--was in reality, in his early time and full prime, a\r\ntraveler, a man of the world, somewhat of a diplomat, and one who knew\r\nthe leading minds of Europe and of his own country in the days when\r\nthere were giants. It is really pleasant to travel in these pages over\r\nthe _grande route_ as it was just before the incredible facilities of\r\nmodern transit had worn away so many peculiarities--to get home-glimpses\r\nof people who generally turn only a formal great-reputation side to the\r\nworld--and above all, to read IRVING as he was and while he grew to\r\ngreatness. And the work is well done, as Irving knew it would be. We\r\ncongratulate the world on having gained volumes so fully deserving place\r\nby the side of the writings of their subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MEMOIRS OF THE REV. NICHOLAS MURRAY, D.D. (KIRWAN). By SAMUEL\r\n     IBENAUS PRIME. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1862.\r\n\r\nA well compiled life of a Presbyterian divine, who worked long and\r\nfaithfully in his calling, leaving marks of varied ability, and strove\r\nin all things great and small to attain his ideal of duty. Such a work,\r\nwritten in the spirit of truth toward the subject, indulging neither in\r\nhighflown eulogy nor in abstract essaying, as we find this to be, is a\r\nrarity, and is none the less excellent because simply written and\r\nunpretentious. Its author is well known in literature, and experience\r\nhas taught him how to write a biography in the right way. While the work\r\nin question is of course possessed of more peculiar interest to the\r\nmembers of a certain sect, it should be observed that it is of a kind\r\nwhich should be read with interest by all Christians, and indeed by all\r\nwho respect earnestness, philanthropy, and sound goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE POEMS OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. New\r\n     York: G. P. Putnam. 1862.\r\n\r\nWe have often wanted this book--the whole collection of the poems of our\r\nHOLMES in one volume--and welcome it as a most delightful gift. All of\r\nthe racy, charming, naive lays of his younger song-days are here; and it\r\nis the highest praise we can award them to say that they are as charming\r\nas ever, and will never lose their beauty.\r\n\r\nYet, the poet is too modest in his opening lay, for _all_ are beautiful:\r\n\r\n   'And some might say, 'Those ruder songs\r\n     Had freshness which the new have lost;\r\n   To spring the opening leaf belongs,\r\n     The chestnut burs await the frost.'\r\n\r\n   'When those I wrote my locks were brown;\r\n     When these I write--ah! well-a-day!\r\n   The autumn thistle's silvery down\r\n     Is not the purple bloom of May.'\r\n\r\nWe at least find no frost, no benumbing influence manifested anywhere.\r\nWe love the old favorites because they were favorites of old. The\r\nyounger reader, who has only of late months learned the 'Chambered\r\nNautilus,' 'The Deacon's Masterpiece,' or 'Parson Turrel's Legacy,'\r\nwill, thirty years hence, recall the sweet flavor of their first taste,\r\neven as we recall the latter years of the blessed rosy decade of the\r\neighteen hundred and thirties, and, with them, how they were made leafy\r\nand odorant and golden by 'The Katydid Song'--by 'The Dilemma'--by\r\n'L'Imanuel;' or how they were be-merried by the 'Dorchester Giant'--'The\r\nOysterman'--the--but the book hath its table of contents!\r\n\r\nWe believe, honestly and earnestly, that the blue and gold, 'dorézure,'\r\nvolume before us is the most agreeable, readable, and spirited book of\r\npoetry ever written by an American--it is not worth while to sail into\r\nthe cloudy regions of antique or Old World comparison--and that it would\r\nbe impossible to select anything in print of the same market value which\r\nwould be so acceptable as a gift to so great a number of persons. We\r\ntrust, by the way, that this hint will not be lost on all gentlemen or\r\nladies who play at philop[oe]na, or who are desirous of displaying\r\nrefined taste at no great expense on birthday and Christmas occasions.\r\nAnd we would beg our reader, for his own sake, not to rely on the fact\r\nthat he has read many of these lyrics in bygone years, as an excuse for\r\nnot providing himself with the new edition. We assure him that he can\r\nhave no idea how much better and fresher and fairer they all seem in\r\ncompany. Something, too, should be said of the excellent full-length,\r\nadmirably engraved portrait of Dr. HOLMES, pre-facing the title--the\r\nbest likeness of our poet extant, and one which, to use a familiar\r\nthough somewhat famished phrase, 'is alone well worth the price of the\r\nvolume.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND.\r\n\r\n   LONDON, _Nov. 1, 1862_,\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\nI have read Mr. Kirke's celebrated anti-slavery book called _Among the\r\nPines_, and, so far as published in the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, his\r\n_Merchant's Story_ on the same subject; but I have changed my views on\r\nthis question, and so has England. _Antislavery_ was our policy for more\r\nthan a quarter of a century to produce a civil war between the North and\r\nthe South, and now we adopt _pro slavery_ views to make sure the\r\ndissolution of the Union. That Union was growing too strong, and with\r\nits success the Republican principle too powerful. We are acting in\r\n_self defence_, to save the monarchy and aristocracy of England. The\r\nAmerican States were once our colonies, and they have no right to\r\ndestroy us by restoring the Union.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston was certain we should have had war on the Trent affair,\r\nbut Lord Lyons was outwitted by Lincoln. We should have had the war then\r\nas we intended, and given decisive aid to the South. But we are aiding\r\nthem now to equip cruisers to destroy American commerce, and furnishing\r\nthem arms and munitions of war. They have very little money or credit,\r\nbut our Government has a large secret service fund, and our capitalists\r\nand aristocracy are contributing quietly and liberally. It is done by\r\nway of _insurance_, at large rates, on privateers and cargoes.\r\nConfederate bonds are deposited by Mr. Mason, the Minister of the South,\r\nto cover all risks. Some time since I converted all my U. S. stock into\r\nConfederate bonds, which I shall continue to hold, and have invested\r\n£50,000 in this insurance operation, which may pay well.\r\n\r\nHow we all have wished that Columbus had never discovered America, or\r\nthat the continent could be submerged; but all will be made right by the\r\nsuccess of the South.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, the Confederate Minister, assures me, that the South would\r\nmuch rather be ruled by England than by the North; that the South are\r\nready for monarchy and aristocracy; that slavery and aristocracy are\r\nkindred principles; and that the _elite_ (like the F. F. V.'s) of their\r\nslaveholders, would make a splendid nobility. It is his opinion that the\r\nSouth must have a State religion and proscribe all others. Slavery then,\r\nhe says, would be their corner stone in Church and State, and the first\r\narticle of their creed would be--_slavery is a divine institution_. He\r\nquoted largely from the Old and New Testaments--from Moses and St. Paul,\r\nto prove the divinity of slavery, and said the sermon on the Mount had\r\nbeen mistranslated. His argument is cogent to prove that monarchy and\r\naristocracy should favor slavery as the best means of keeping down, the\r\nworking classes, now clamoring in England for the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine will soon be broached in Parliament, and finds great favor\r\nin Exeter hall, where a statue will be erected in honor of Jefferson\r\nDavis, _the man who saved England by destroying America!_\r\n\r\nIf my friend Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe would write a great novel in\r\nfavor of Slavery, we would make her a Duchess; and if Mr. Kirke, instead\r\nof such stories as _Among the Pines_, would give us the Bible view of\r\nSlavery, and reconcile whipping and branding slaves to the doctrine 'do\r\nunto others,' &e., he should be made an Earl. We are anxiously awaiting\r\nin England the grand movement which that great and good man ex-President\r\nBuchanan will soon make in favor of the South. England wishes Peace\r\nCommissioners to settle this question, and Mr. Buchanan to be one of\r\nthem, on the part of the North, and that truly honest man, Gov. Floyd,\r\nanother, on the part of the South--although my own choice would be\r\nWigfall!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomething must be done to prevent the free acceptance of parole by our\r\ntroops. Thousands and thousands 'have taken the word' and thereby\r\nincapacitated themselves from taking further part in the war. Let the\r\npress and the people awake to the infamy which a ready surrender on\r\nparole conditions brings, and we shall soon see the last of it. Let us\r\ncontinue by commending to all who have yielded themselves up, save in\r\ndire need, the following\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE SNEAK.\r\n\r\n   'Rest sword, cool blushes, and PAROLLES--live!'\r\n\r\n   SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n   I saw the foe advancing,\r\n       Says I, 'Boys,' says I.\r\n   'This is rather ugly dancing.\r\n       Which the general makes us try,\r\n   Where the bayonets are glancing,'\r\n       Says I, 'boys,' says I.\r\n\r\n   When the bullets got to dropping,\r\n       Says I, 'Boys,'says I,\r\n   I wish there were some stopping\r\n       These blue beetles as they fly.\r\n   And which set a fellow hopping;'\r\n       Says I, 'boys,' says I.\r\n\r\n   And I'd scarcely pulled a trigger,\r\n       Says I, 'Boys,' says I,\r\n   I 'aint got a mite of vigor,'--\r\n       So I skulked and tried to fly,\r\n   But was booted by a nigger,\r\n       And back I had to shy.\r\n\r\n   Then the Confed's came before us;\r\n       Says I, 'Boys,'says I,\r\n   'I guess they're goin' to floor us,\r\n       Or to knock us high and dry;'\r\n   When they all sang out in chorus--\r\n       'Yield or die! yield or die!\r\n\r\n   'If you yield, we will parole you.'\r\n       Then says I, ' Boys,' says I,\r\n   'I have no wish to control you;\r\n       But, unless you want to die,\r\n   The best way to console you,\r\n       Is to go parole,' says I;\r\n\r\n   'When we won't have no more fighting,'\r\n       Says I, 'boys,' says I,\r\n   'Yet, in our pay delighting,\r\n       We can loaf at ease, all day,\r\n   And keep clear of guns affrighting\r\n       All a feller's nerves,' says I.\r\n\r\n   Now I blow and bluster bolder,\r\n       And at home, 'Boys,' says I,\r\n   'I used to be a soldier,\r\n       But I was too brave to fly,\r\n   And I'm, therefore, a parol-der,\r\n       Of the noblest kind,' says I.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackwood's Magazine, for September, treated the British public to an\r\narticle on Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS, in which that character is, of course,\r\nexalted to the pinnacle of greatness. Of its fairness and truthfulness,\r\nthe following is a good specimen:\r\n\r\n     'Mr. Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for 75,000 troops to put\r\n     down the rebellion. _This_ was the torch that lit up the South, and\r\n     rendered subsequent compromise impossible.'\r\n\r\nWas it indeed? when there is no fact in history so directly clear and\r\nplain as that secession was a foregone conclusion in the South, from the\r\nmoment that the possibility of Lincoln's election was conjectured. We\r\nare told that it was entirely the fault of the North that this\r\ndiabolical rebellion burst out! It is always the North that is to blame,\r\nnow, with John Bull. But we have more of it:\r\n\r\n     'Had Mr. Davis's warning voice been listened to in January, we\r\n     believe that instead of passing a year and a half of bloodshed,\r\n     enormous extravagance and dire calamity, we should have found that\r\n     the seceding States would have by this time returned to the shadow\r\n     of the 'Star-spangled Banner;' and that an enduring peace would\r\n     have ere now been made between the North and the South.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAll our fault, of course! If we had only let them alone--let them\r\ngo--they would have taken a frisky turn or two, and then come sweetly\r\nback to unity! Our _Blackwood_ writer lacks something. He wants manhood,\r\npluck, spirit, common sense, and very common information. He is\r\ndeficient in enlarged views of humanity; he cannot comprehend a\r\ntremendous struggle of principles involving the social progress of\r\nthirty millions, half of whose men at least are much more intelligent\r\nand larger hearted than himself. With narrow, petty Tory instinct, he\r\nclings to 'aristocracy' in whatever form it occurs, and instinctively\r\nwars on the masses. The noblest struggle in history--the greatest effort\r\nto advance labor in the scale of social dignity and practical value is\r\nall as naught in his eyes and in those of his clan; they flippantly\r\nignore all that is noble in this noble war, and repeat, after CARLYLE,\r\nhis brutal, beastly joke--that America has long been the dirtiest of\r\npolitical chimneys, and requires a good burning out. Take care, Master\r\nCARLYLE, that from this burning no sparks are wafted England-ward. You,\r\ntoo, will some day have a chimney on fire, and when it burns the heat\r\nwill be felt through every brick in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nYE NEW YORKE YOUNGE LADYE\r\n\r\nIs a peculyar Institution.\r\n\r\nIff there had a been no suche place as Paris, ye New Yorke Younge Ladye\r\nwould have invented itt.\r\n\r\nAs itt is, shee is thankfull thatt shee hathe been sparyed ye trouble of\r\nhaving that towne builte. For itt is verie usefull to hir; sendying her\r\nbonetes, robes, shoos, bootees, parasoletts, skirtes, pettycoates, and\r\nchemi--cal preparations--suche as LUBIN hys violette and vitivert;\r\nRIMMEL, hys bandoline; PIVER hys _Nohiba de la Mecque_; MAUGENET and\r\nCONDRAYE, their _savon imperiale;_ MONPELAS hys _eau de toilette_, wyth\r\nothir lyttle thinges too numerouse to mentyon. BOIVIN or JOUVIN, or some\r\nother _vin_, hath long since hadd hir hande--in plaster of Paris--from\r\nwhich he makyth hir gloves, whych are smuggled home unto hir--I wyll not\r\nsaye howe. But Ive hearde in mye tyme of a state dispatch wyth a bigg\r\nredd seale, whych dyd containe four dozen paire of number sixe, ladye's\r\nsyze.\r\n\r\nWhan thatt shee is arayed in these gaye clothynges and other thynges she\r\nhathe verament a fyne style suche as yee can see none fyner not in ye\r\nRue Helder ittself. And att a balle shee wereth splendyd jewels, so that\r\noft-tymes yee wold veralye think she were ye image of Notre Dame de\r\nLoretto wyth all hir braverye. Wyth suche a one dyd I fall yn love at a\r\nhopp at Neweporte--yea, even into a _moulte graunte passion de haulte\r\ndegréz_, and wolde gladlie have marryd hir, hadd shee not in frennshe\r\nsaid '_Per ma fey, beau Sire_, I wyll gladlie bee engagyd to ye, for itt\r\nis ye fashion to bee betrothed, but do not talke of marryage, since I\r\nwoulde not have folks thinke I am of age to marrye!' Ah, Sainte Marye!\r\nbutt shee was a bricke!\r\n\r\n   'About her necke a flowyre of fresh devise,\r\n     Wyth rubies set that lusty were to sene,\r\n   And she in gown was light and summer-wise,\r\n     Shapen full--the colour was of grene,\r\n     With aureat sent about her sides clene,\r\n   With divers stones, precious and rich;\r\n   Thus was she 'rayed, yet saw I ne'er her lich.'\r\n\r\nYe New Yorke Younge Ladye hath many friendes; ye can not speake of any\r\none in societye who is not deare untoe her, or of any notable man of any\r\nfigure who hath not been introduced to her. Shee entertayneth in a\r\npartye seven gentyll men at ones--yea eight or nine will gathir around\r\nhir, and when they goe they will all declare that they have had plentye\r\nto talk. Shee hath a whole librarye of photograph albumes; yett her crye\r\nis 'Give! give!' and, lo! they are given; for itt is a good\r\nadvertisement to bee in her bookes, and ye younge men know itt. So thatt\r\nit sometimes cometh to pass, that when one asketh 'Didd ye ever meet Mr.\r\nSo-and-soe in societye?' ye answer wyll be: 'Yea--I saw him lately in\r\nJOSEPHINE HOOPES her album.

Evil befall hym who callyth her a mere\r\nlylye of ye vallie. For shee oftetymes goeth among ye poore; yea,\r\nteacheth in ragged schooles; scoldeth ye bone-pickers' children in\r\nGerman, and ye hand-organ man his olyve-colored whelpes in Italyan;\r\nseweth for ye armye; vysiteth the starvynge familye of which ye\r\nhome-missionarye hath told her; and makyth up a class for ye poore\r\nlittle Swiss governesse oute of employe. Sometymes shee marryeth an\r\nofficer, who hathe not much moneye, and then goeth thro' campe life with\r\nmerrye hearte; or itt may be thatt shee weddeth a clergieman--for, all\r\nof thys have I known ye Fifth Avenue belle to do; and I veralye coulde\r\nnott see that shee dyd not make as goode a wyfe as anie other woman.\r\n\r\nYe New Yorke Younge Ladye seldom seeth ye gentlymen save by gas-lighte.\r\nFor it is true thatt when she is lazye shee getteth not up to breakfast\r\nso earlye as her Pa and her Brother; or, if shee be converted to ye\r\nhealth-doctrine, she hath coffee and gooeth out ryding before them, and\r\ntheye departe meanwhiles to their offyces or stores, whence they returne\r\nnot tyll dynnere in ye eveninge. At noon she giveth--or goeth out\r\nuntoe--lunche with other ladyes, and collecteth all ye newes of ye day,\r\nand displayeth her fashion abilities and feedeth well; whense itt cometh\r\nthat shee eteth verie little at hir dynnere, and ye strangere who is\r\nwythin her gates, and knoweth nott of ye lunchceone, mervayleth gretlye\r\nat her slendere diet.

Likewyse shee rideth in sleighs\r\nunto Highe Bridge, and hath a partycularlie nyce tyme wyth hir beau, or\r\nanie other man who is _comme yl faut_. On Sundaye mornynges itt is a\r\nfayre sighte to see her going to and fro churche in a _chapeau de Paris\r\nde la dernyère agonie_, bearyng a _parasolett a la ripp snap mettez-la\r\nencore debout_ style; and whych shee sayes is like a _homme blasé_,\r\nbecause it is Used Upp. Sundaie afternoon yee may find her in ye\r\nSixteenth or Twentie-eighth strete Catholic churches, lystening to ye\r\nsuperbe music and wyshing herselfe an angell. For shee is verie fonde of\r\nmusicke (especiallie vocale from a handsome Don Juan tenor-io), and\r\noften singeth sweetlye hirself; and, _per ma fey_, I knowe of one whose\r\n_Te daro un baccio d'amore_ is very killynge indede.\r\n\r\n   'Wel can she syng and lustely,\r\n   None half so well and semely,\r\n     And coude make in song such refraining,\r\n     It sate her wonder well to singe;\r\n   Her voice full clere was and full swete, * *\r\n       Her eyen gay and glad also--\r\n   That laughden aye in her semblaunt,\r\n   First on the mouth by covenant--\r\n       I wote no lady so liking.'\r\n\r\nAnd soe shee goeth on thro' lyfe, a large-heartyd, good-natured\r\nsoule--stylish to beholde; jollie to talke wyth; greatlye abusyd by ye\r\nsix-penny novelists, all of whom are delyghted when shee condescendes to\r\nsmile on them; and greatlye admyred in Paris, where shee oftetimes\r\nout-Frensheth ye Frennsh themselves. As for mee, I doe avowe that I\r\nadore her, for as muche as shee is a noble bricke, and, as DAN LYDGATE\r\nsayth, 'a whole teeme, whyppe and alle, wyth a Dalmatian coache-dog\r\nunder ye axle.' And thatt shee may go itt like a Countesse whyle shee is\r\nyounge, and a Duchesse whenn shee is olde, is ye hearte's prayer of--\r\n\r\n   CLERKE NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes our reader know Loring's in Boston? It is a place of literary\r\nmeeting, where one sees those who Athenianize it--poets, philosophers,\r\nministers, but, above all, the pretty girls who read, and the _jeunesse\r\ndorée_ who don't--but go there to look at the damsels who do. Why don't\r\nNew York start a library as alluring as LORING'S?\r\n\r\n'How do you get books from LORING'S?' asked a stranger lately of one of\r\nthe damsels in question.\r\n\r\n'By Hiring,' was the reply.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a 'goak,' although the querist didn't see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ILLINOIS, _Aug. ----_\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL hath many correspondents--among the 'welcomest' of whom\r\nwe class the one who speaks as followeth from the far West. We have many\r\na good friend and hearty _bon compagnon_ in that same West:\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: 'When you have found a day to be idle, be idle for a\r\nday'--a charming saying for the indolent, which WILLIS prefixes to one\r\nof his earlier poems, crediting it to a volume of Chinese proverbs; yet,\r\ndespite this, I am by no means sure as to its origin, for I suspect it\r\nis a trick of the trade for authors to charge all absurdities they are\r\nashamed to own, and all fantastic vagaries they are too grave to\r\nacknowledge, to the Celestials, who, we are told, go to battle a fan in\r\none hand and an umbrella in the other (a very sensible way too, with an\r\noccasional mint julip this warm weather); but, however all that may be,\r\nI adopt the saying; and, lazily resting my head, propose, pen in hand,\r\nto scratch down for you a chapter of anecdotes. I would rather sit near\r\nyou, O MEISTER KARL, this sunny day of the waning June, in some forest\r\nnook; and when you had grown weary of talking (not I of listening) and\r\nhad lit your old time meerschaum, I would tell you the stories, and you\r\nmight repeat such as amused you to your readers. The first was suggested\r\nto me by your Jacksonville correspondent, in the just come July number.\r\n\r\n'I, too, am an 'Athenian:'' and my story of a citizen of that\r\nbe-colleged town is most authentic. The Rev. Mr. S----, former principal\r\nof the 'mill,' as certain profane students were wont to name the\r\nSeminary, wherein (did you believe the exhibition tickets) our\r\n'daughters' were ground into 'corner-stones' polished after the\r\n'similitude of a palace,' was a man of unusually modest humility, and\r\nsomewhat absent-minded.\r\n\r\nThere came to the school, at commencement (no--hold on!--a young student\r\nwith three hairs on each lip, and about as many ideas in his brains, has\r\ntold me that was not the word for the 'Anniversary day' of a female\r\nschool--O scion of the male school, I submit). It was, then, the\r\n'anniversary of 'the mill.'' A clergyman from abroad, of superior\r\nabilities, was expected to address the graduating class. Row upon row\r\nof white-robed maidens smiled in sly flirtation upon rows of admiring\r\neyes in the audience below. Grave school-trustees, ponderous-browed\r\nlawyers, the united clergy (the aforesaid Athens boasts some fifteen\r\nchurches), and last, but not least, the professors and the 'Prex' of the\r\ncollege, par excellence (for there are some half dozen 'digs' or\r\ndignitaries so named in the town), sat in a body near the\r\nstage--'invited guests.' Songs were sung--the fleeting joys of earth,\r\nthe delights of study, the beauty of flowers, the excellence of wisdom,\r\nand kindred themes discoursed upon by low-voiced essayists, till the\r\nvaledictory came; but with Mr. S----, meanwhile, all went _not_ merry as\r\na marriage bell: the expected orator came not, and was sought for in\r\nvain; the valedictorian-ess ceased; the parting song was sung; an\r\nexpectant hum rose from the audience; the blue-ribboned diplomas waited\r\nin a wreath of roses. At last, embarrassed and perplexed, the preceptor\r\nrose. 'Young ladies,' he began, 'I had expected to see here,' and his\r\nglance wandered over the picture-studded, asparagus-wreathed hall, till\r\nit rested quietly on the aforementioned body of village\r\ndignitaries--then he continued: 'I expected to-day an individual _more\r\ncompetent than myself_ to address to you these parting words, but (with\r\na last anxious glance at the Faculty) _that_ individual _I_ do _not_ now\r\nbehold.'\r\n\r\nUntil afterward admonished by his better half, Mr. S---- was unconscious\r\nof his arrogance, and of the cause of the ill-concealed mirth of the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nRather verbose that anecdote; but, pardon something to the memories of\r\nolden times.\r\n\r\nIt was the same preceptor who, a member of the graduating class having\r\nmade all her arrangements beforehand, announced, after the usual\r\ndistribution of prizes, that the highest ever bestowed on a similar\r\noccasion was now to be awarded, for diligence and good deportment, to\r\nMiss H---- H----; whereupon, in the fewest words possible, he performed\r\nthe marriage ceremony, and gave her--a husband. Encouraging to the\r\njuniors, was it not?\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, questioning the other day a small boy as to his home\r\nplaymates and amusements, asked him of the number and age of the\r\nchildren of a neighbor, at whose house there was, unknown to her, a bran\r\nnew baby. 'Oh,' answered the five year old, with some scorn,'she hasn't\r\ngot but two, one of 'em's 'bout as big as me, and the other--the other's\r\non'y jest begun.'\r\n\r\nA wee little boy, who had a great habit of saying he was frightened at\r\neverything, was one day walking with me in the garden, and clung to me\r\nsuddenly, saying, 'I'se frightened of that sing,' and, looking down, I\r\nsaw a caterpillar near his foot.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no,' said I, reassuringly and somewhat reprovingly, 'Georgie's not\r\nfrightened at _such a little thing_!' Five minutes after, we were\r\nsitting on the doorsteps, and, wearing a low-necked dress, I felt on my\r\nshoulder some stirring creature; it was a caterpillar, and, with the\r\ninevitable privileged feminine screech on such occasions, I dashed it\r\noff; then, turning, I met the usually grave gray eyes kindling with\r\nmischievous triumph: '_Aunty's_ frightened of a little sing,' says\r\nGeorgie, with triumphant emphasis on the 'Aunty.'\r\n\r\nAnother little rogue, a black-eyed 'possible president' of course, when\r\nbetween two and three years, was opening and shutting a door, amusing\r\nhimself as he watched the sunshine come and go on the walls of the\r\nsitting room, streaming through the lattice of a porch beyond.\r\nPresently, while holding the door open, a cloud floated over the sun.\r\n'Aunty, aunty,' cried he, as surprised as he was earnest, 'somebody's\r\nshutting door up in the sky.'\r\n\r\nI was amused, not long ago, at a passage in the letter of an eldest\r\ndaughter, eight years old, to her absent father: the womanly dignity of\r\nher station and the child's sense of justice quite stifled any tendency\r\nto sympathetic remarks. 'Johnny,' she wrote, 'has not been very bad,\r\nneither can I say he has been very good; he ran away from nurse twice,\r\nand once from mamma, who of course did with him _as he deserved_.'\r\n\r\nA correspondent of mine in the army (a whilom contributor of yours, by\r\nthe way) writes me this:\r\n\r\n'After the Corinthian 'skedadle' (the demi-savans (I don't mean\r\nNapoleon's in Egypt, but the provinvial editors--in some cases it\r\namounts to the same thing) having proved the word to be Greek, I suppose\r\nit is slang no longer), the Tenth Illinois regiment (Dick Wolcott, you\r\nknow) camped a few miles to the northward, near the woods; and hasty but\r\nshady structures were soon reared in front of the officers' tents; but\r\none morning there arose a great wind, and the 'arboresque' screens\r\nbecame rapidly as _non est_ as Jonah's gourd. A group of uniforms stood\r\nwatching the flying branches. 'Boys,' said Captain M., gravely, as\r\nsomewhat ruefully his eye follows the vanishing shelter of his own door,\r\n'that's evidently a left bower.' 'The Captain,' MEERSCHAUM adds, 'is\r\nrapidly convalescing.' I fancy this enough for one letter.\r\n\r\n_Two days later._--\r\n\r\n     I have been keeping these anecdotes for you for some time, and\r\n     should have sent them earlier; now--it seems almost cruel to laugh\r\n     since the dark days in Virginia, or to write frivolous nonsense.\r\n     Yet, I cannot work; and before these lines reach your readers (if\r\n     they ever do) the sky will, I hope, be clear again, and the regrets\r\n     I am tempted to utter would be as out of tune as the exultant\r\n     predictions of a week ago seem now. Far away to the horizon stretch\r\n     the golden fields of ripened grain; the abundant harvest is at\r\n     hand: yet a little while ago we heard dismal laments of blighting\r\n     rains and hostile insects; and many faithless ones ploughed up\r\n     their verdant wheatfields in despair. May the harvest of a nation's\r\n     victory come thus, teaching the incredulous faith in the\r\n     right--but, ah! the lengthened struggle is what I dread, not the\r\n     end--that cannot fail us.\r\n\r\n     I wrote you a special, all-to-yourself letter, not long since,\r\n     which I hope you will have answered before this comes to you.

If\r\nit has any significance you will, I know, give it place; if not, not. I\r\nwill be sincerely acquiescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BRIDAL.\r\n\r\n   I ride along the lonely sands,\r\n   Where once we rode with clasping hands.\r\n\r\n   The wild waves sob upon the beach,\r\n   As mournful as love's parting speech.\r\n\r\n   Those cruel waves, close-clasped they hold\r\n   My lost love, with his locks of gold.\r\n\r\n   Here, while the wind blew from the south,\r\n   He kissed me with his tender mouth.\r\n\r\n   Oh, sun of hope, in dark eclipse!\r\n   Oh, aching heart, and unkissed lips!\r\n\r\n   On, on I ride, faster, in vain,\r\n   I cannot hush the cry of pain\r\n\r\n   In my sick soul. But, hark! how clear\r\n   That voice of voices fills my ear!\r\n\r\n   'Why waitest thou beside the sea?\r\n   Canst thou not die, and come to me?'\r\n\r\n   Soul-king, I come! Alas! my need\r\n   Was great. Press on, my faithful steed.\r\n\r\n   Deep, deep into the sea I ride:\r\n   There my love's hero waits his bride.\r\n\r\n   The longing billows of the sea\r\n   With happy welcome smile to me.\r\n\r\n   They touch my foot, they reach my knee:\r\n   Darling! they draw me thus to thee.\r\n\r\n   They kiss thy picture on my heart;\r\n   Love of my life! no more we part.\r\n\r\n   The rushing waters still my breath:\r\n   Oh! have we dared to fear thee, Death?\r\n\r\n\r\nEBENEZER STIBBS died, near Lewisburg, O., a martyr to his country's\r\ncause, October 14th, 1862, in the seventy-first year of his age. His\r\ndeath was a violent one, though he fell not upon the field of strife;\r\nfor many of the soldiers of our country have never been enrolled, never\r\npromoted, never praised for their gallantry, but, far away from the\r\ntented field, in their lonely homes, are going down to their graves\r\nwithout sound of drum or salute of musket, unnoticed and unknown.\r\n\r\nAnd this brave old man was one of them. Residing for a number of years\r\non a farm with his son, he had long been excused, on account of the\r\ninfirmities of age, from active service on the farm, and even from the\r\nnumerous little tasks about the house and barn involved in the care of\r\nthe family and the stock. His son was drafted, and now, 'who shall look\r\nafter things about the place?' 'Go,' said the brave old hero, 'and serve\r\nyour country, and I'll attend to matters here.'\r\n\r\nHe set about the work in good heart, and seemed likely to succeed\r\nadmirably; but one day, while pushing some hay over the edge of the mow,\r\nhe lost his balance, plunged forward, falling a distance of some ten or\r\ntwelve feet, and, striking his head on the hard threshing floor, was so\r\nstunned as to become entirely insensible. A member of the household soon\r\nafter entered the barn and found him bleeding and helpless. Medical aid\r\nwas immediately summoned, but he survived his injuries only a couple of\r\nhours, and died without speaking a word. When this dreadful war shall\r\nhave ended, and tall white columns shall spring up like an alabaster\r\nforest all over the land, to commemorate the glories of the departed\r\nbrave, let one, at least, of the noble shafts, without legend or\r\ninscription, stand as the representative of those who have fallen in\r\nobscurity, like the soldiers cut off in the forest, unnoticed and\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Buckeye correspondent sends us the following, which is too good to\r\nkeep:\r\n\r\nTHE DEACON AND HIS SON.\r\n\r\nSome years agone, old Deacon S---- kept a corner grocery in the village\r\nof B----. Deacon S---- had a son, who officiated in said grocery. Deacon\r\nS---- professed to be very pious--so did Deacon S.'s son.\r\n\r\nWhether the Deacon and his son were what they professed to be, I will\r\nleave the reader to judge from the following conversation, which took\r\nplace between them, one Saturday night, just before closing the store:\r\n\r\n'Jacob!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Dit you charge Mr. T---- mit te ham?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, father.'\r\n\r\n'Vell, so dit I.'\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n'Jacob!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'You had petter charge him again, so you won't forget him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, father.\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n'Jacob!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Now you can water te vinegar, sand te sugar, and close te store, un den\r\nwe vill haf family worship, un go ter ped!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, father.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Law is,' to use the frequent phrase of a Gothamite contemporary, 'a\r\ncu'ros thing;' and not the least curious phase which it presents is the\r\ndifference between what people say before juries and what they _think_;\r\nas is fully illustrated in the following, by FRANK HACKETT:\r\n\r\n'GRACCHUS,' as the town called him, was a broken-down lawyer, who, as he\r\ngot old, had prostituted the talents of his early days to the meanest\r\nkind of pettifogging and rascality. Everybody did their best to keep out\r\nof his clutches, and his 'make up' was seedy enough; yet he managed to\r\nkeep in court half a dozen 'cranky suits,' in which, to be sure, he\r\nfigured as a party himself, on one side or the other. The circumstances\r\nof one of them, which have just come to our memory, are perhaps worth\r\njotting down:\r\n\r\nFor some quarters, GRACCHUS had not paid any rent, and his landlord made\r\nrepeated requests of him to move out. Even a promise to cancel all\r\narrears would not make him stir. A writ of ejectment would have\r\ndelighted this 'legal spider;' but Mr. R. knew 'when he was well off,'\r\nand refused to resort to that. ' My dear sir, you _must_ go,' said he\r\none day, annoyed at the fellow's obstinacy; 'I have a man coming in\r\nright away, who will pay me a good tenant's rent, and I am going to have\r\nthe office repaired for him. So just make up your mind to quit this\r\nafternoon.'\r\n\r\nAs Mr. R. turned to go out, he examined the window nearest him, and\r\npoked his cane through the decayed sash and crumbling glass in two or\r\nthree places, with the remark: 'A pretty condition this for a business\r\nman's office to be in!' Nobody was surprised to hear that evening that a\r\nsuit had been brought against Mr. R. for damages in trespass.\r\n\r\nMr. R.'s counsel told him that the best thing he could do would be to go\r\nto trial as soon as possible, and if he got out of it with a small sum\r\nfor damages and no further annoyance, he would be lucky. GRACCHUS had\r\nsecured 'Squire SWEET to argue the case to the jury--probably 'on\r\nshares.' To hear SWEET 'warm up' before the panel, you would have sworn\r\nthat the 'palladium of justice' and the other 'fixtures' had their\r\nsalvation staked on the success of his client. And if there was anything\r\nhe thought himself competent to 'operate largely' on, it was a damage\r\nsuit. On this occasion, the vivid picture he drew of an unwarrantable\r\nintrusion upon this aged and indefatigable servant of the public, the\r\ninjury inflicted upon his 'valuable health,' and his generous conduct in\r\ncontenting himself with the paltry sum of eighty dollars by way of\r\ndamages, was to be set down as the 'Squire's best effort.\r\n\r\nThe jury went out just as the court was on the point of adjournment, and\r\nreceived orders to seal up their verdict for the morning. Each man had\r\nto 'chalk' what in his judgment was a sufficient sum for damages. They\r\nranged all along in the neighborhood of three or four dollars, except\r\none or two individuals, who had believed the whole of the plaintiff's\r\ncomplaint, and went in for something more than nominal damages. One in\r\nparticular, who always swore by SWEET, aimed so high that the average\r\ncame above the $13.33 that was necessary to carry costs.\r\n\r\nAfter they had determined upon a verdict, our high-priced friend, with\r\none or two others, went around to the hotel to retire for the night. As\r\nthey went in, the clerk of the court met them with a pack of cards in\r\nhis hands, with which a party had just finished playing whist. 'It\r\ndidn't take us half so long to agree on that case. SWEET and the rest of\r\nus marked around on that verdict, just before we finished the last game,\r\nand we made it out--two dollars and twenty-five cents.' 'The d---- you\r\ndid,' replied our astonished friend. 'Why, how much did 'Squire SWEET\r\nmark, himself?' 'Uncommon high. He said he thought five dollars was\r\nabout the fair thing.' '_Five dollars!_' gasped the juryman; 'Squire\r\nSWEET put down only _five dollars_, when he went and told the jury that\r\neighty dollars wasn't nothin' to it. Look a-here, can't I go back and\r\nchange that figure of mine, afore the verdict comes in?'\r\n\r\nIt was decided pretty unanimously that--he _couldn't_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur readers will recall the author of the following poem, as a writer\r\nwho has more than once given us poems indicating much refinement of\r\ntaste, based on sound old English scholarship:\r\n\r\n\r\nNO CROSS, NO CROWN.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY DUMARS.\r\n\r\n   No mortal yet e'er gained the golden crown\r\n     Who did not in his search the cross upbear;\r\n     For heaven he need entertain no care\r\n   Who fears to sinfulness the Devil's frown,\r\n   And lays, if once espoused, his burdens down,\r\n     Because so many of his followers have no burden there.\r\n\r\n   And thus it is so many are awrong;\r\n     'Tis easier, they deem, the crown to gain\r\n     With limbs at will and shoulders free from pain,\r\n   Than bearing this great burden still along:\r\n   Besides, will not my brothers be among\r\n     The crowned ere I, unless I free my loins again?\r\n\r\n   Columbia doth seek the crown,--and sooth\r\n     No nation of the earth deserves it more;\r\n     But, ah! she is unwise as lands before\r\n   In hoping thus, what time she quits the Truth,\r\n   And showing unto enemies more ruth\r\n     Than even God doth show to us, weak worldlings sore.\r\n\r\n   Where once against the heavens men rebelled,\r\n     And forced the Prince of Peace to deadly war,\r\n     Did not He spread a deluge deep and far,\r\n   Not sweeping them alone, but all they held?\r\n   When they His awful earnestness beheld,\r\n     Were not they penitent, though vain, as bad sons are?\r\n\r\n   And why should we but lighten through a spell\r\n     These murderous madmen in our country here,\r\n     Their craziness to come or far or near\r\n   Anew, as more they learn of prompting hell?\r\n   Must not we now the CAUSE forever quell,\r\n     As Hercules did one time slay a source of fear?\r\n\r\n   If Truth is mighty, 'tis not so alone;\r\n     There's more availability in Error;\r\n     That end's not gained that's gained alone With terror:\r\n   The way of Right but leadeth to the crown;\r\n   Who conquer _perfectly_, peace-seed have sown;\r\n     Reform's remaining ill usurps at last the furrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Correspondent, who is interested in education and not uninterested in\r\nhumanity, sends us the following _bona fide_ advertisement, specifying\r\nthe qualifications and accomplishments expected from the lady teachers\r\nof a certain Western community:\r\n\r\n     'When employing a lady as teacher in our Public Schools, we desire,\r\n     in addition to a thorough education, to secure the following\r\n     qualifications;\r\n\r\n     '1st.

Reader, did you ever fairly _master_ even a test book on\r\nthe subject--say, JOHN DALTON'S--and acquire with it the anatomical\r\nknowledge essential to a merely superficial comprehension of the\r\nsubject? Did you ever dissect any, and attend the usual lectures? The\r\nYoung Lady in question must have done more than this.\r\n\r\n'Political Science!'\r\n\r\n'Chemistry!' That is rather a heavy draft, too. We have been closely\r\nunder old LEOPOLD GMÉLIN in our time, and worked a winter or so hard at\r\nthe test glasses, and had divers courses of lectures under divers\r\neminent professors, and read LIEBIG and STÖCKHARDT and others more or\r\nless--just enough to learn that to _honestly teach_ chemistry, even in\r\nthe most elementary manner, months and years of additional work were\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\n'Botany!' Botany is rather a large-sized object to acquire--even to\r\nbecome the merest _amateur_. A year's lectures from Dr. TORREY and some\r\nhard work over GRAY and DE CANDOLLE and the rest, are not enough even\r\nfor this. It was but yesterday and to us that a gentleman whose special\r\npleasure is botany, who has devoted thousands of dollars and years to\r\nthe pursuit, ridiculed the suggestion that he was qualified to teach it.\r\n\r\n'Zoology, Astronomy, Rhetoric, Meteorology, and--History!'\r\n\r\nDon't be alarmed, reader. Very possibly the young lady in question will\r\nnot be _too_ strictly examined in all these branches--- neither will she\r\nbe required to impart more than the mildest possible of knowledge to her\r\npupils. Very possibly, too, she will teach Chemistry--think of it, ye\r\nbrethren of the retort!--_without experiments!!_ For just such atrocious\r\nand ridiculous humbug have we known to be passed off on children, in\r\n've-ry expensive' 'first-class' ladies' schools in Philadelphia and in\r\nNew York, for instruction in Chemistry. The young brains were vexed and\r\nwearied day after day to acquire by vague description and by _rote_ the\r\ndetails of an almost purely experimental science.\r\n\r\nAnd, 'a mind _richly_ stored with general information!'\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that magic is out of date.

Capital! The only objection\r\nin the world that I have is, that it reminds me of 'Old Conn,' the\r\npoliceman, who used to loom up around corners with his big, ugly\r\nfeatures, to the terror of the small boys, when I was 'of that ilk.'\r\nThese huge, overgrown, slow hulks almost always 'pick on' the boys; the\r\nreal hard work of the force is done by your small, wiry fellows, who\r\nstep around lively, and don't stop to see whether a man is 'bigger nor\r\nthey.' Old Conn, though, was a pretty good-hearted man after all,\r\ndespite unpopularity among the juveniles; and so I say, let us christen\r\nthe youngster 'Old Con,' by all means--old in the affections of a host\r\nof friends, if not in years.\r\n\r\nBut _revenons à nous moutons_, as the scribblers say, whose _mouton_ we\r\ndare say is less often 'material' than we could wish it were.\r\n\r\nAs I set about penning a rambling thought, then, and--\r\n\r\n_En passant_, did you never notice how a tendency to ramble will\r\nsometimes almost completely control a man? A candidate for Congress, for\r\ninstance, comes round to your town to talk to you 'like a fa-ther'about\r\nwhat? To tell you that he has made all his arrangements to go to\r\nWashington? and could go just as well as not if you would like to have\r\nhim? and that, on the whole, he wants to go awfully? No, indeed; nine\r\ncases out of ten the poor fellow forgets _himself_, and wanders off into\r\nthe 'glorious Constitution as our fathers framed it,' and the 'eternal\r\nprinciples,' ' sacrifices' that one's constituency require, and a full\r\nassortment of such phrase. Just as some of the speakers, at the 'war\r\nmeetings' this summer, get up a full head of patriotic steam, and in the\r\nexcitement of the moment 'don't remember' all about mentioning that they\r\nare going themselves. Inclined to ramble!\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't what I meant to observe at the outset. Let us change the\r\nsubject, as they say at the medical college.\r\n\r\nWhat I was about to remark originally was--and I don't know as it is\r\noriginal, either. The fact is, there is very little now-a-days that is\r\nstrictly original--except war-correspondence, and of course nobody but\r\nold maids reads _that_. There is a fellow who writes for the\r\n'Daily----,' and signs himself 'Wabash.' Well, what of it? Nothing; only\r\nsome people think it ought to be spelt, 'War bosh.'\r\n\r\nAs I was saying: As I sit down to cover a few slips--it seems to me that\r\nI have already filled out one slip of the paper; and, by the by, that\r\nreminds me of a bright thing that Ben Zoleen,[5] a bachelor friend of\r\nmine, allowed himself to be the father of, the other day. Ben likes to\r\n'take something,' and about a month ago he took the 'enrolment.' An\r\nIrishman, after laying claim to the usual disability--lameness\r\nsomewhere, and besides 'he was all the man that his wife Joanna had to\r\nwork for the family'--swore that all the property he had in the world\r\nwas a big porker, and _he_ had broken out and run away 'the divil knows\r\nwhere,' the day before. 'Well, Mike,' said Ben, with a sympathizing\r\ntear, 'yours is not the first fortune that's been lost in this country\r\nby a mere _slip of the pen_' Whist! d'ye hear _that_?\r\n\r\nThe thought that first presented itself was the inquiry whether a man--\r\n\r\n'Not that man, but another man,' interrupted me just then by coming into\r\nthe office and communicating the startling, yet not entirely unexpected\r\nintelligence that 'they had begun to draft here in P.' 'No,' said I.\r\n'Yes,' said he, going out in a hurry; 'up at the brewery.'\r\n\r\n-Whether a man ought to write anything else than a love letter, in the\r\nframe of mind that Voltaire said _that_ document should be composed in:\r\n'Beginning without knowing what you are going to say, and ending without\r\nknowing a word of what you have said.'\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it? I think so, decidedly.\r\n\r\n   HIBBLES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have heard of many an instance where the expression was not that\r\nexactly of the idea that was intended; but in the following 'the idea,\r\nthe expression,' and everything else, are about as thoroughly mixed up\r\nas one could well conceive. We were questioning a young lady as to the\r\nstanding of a clergyman in the town where she lived. 'Oh,' said she,\r\n'_he is too popular to be liked very much_.' Identical! A favorite, we\r\nare told, 'has no friends;' when a poor fellow gets to be popular in the\r\ntown of C----, we pity him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDick Wolcott, of the Tenth Illinois--which has seen no little service\r\nsince the war began--hath written unto us a letter, from which we pick\r\nout the following. A great gossip is this same Dickon of ours, and a\r\nrare good fellow:\r\n\r\n'We have in our company a number of Germans--brave and 'bully' soldiers\r\nall who know better how to handle the arms than the tongue of the land\r\nof their adoption; and their staggers at the language furnish us much\r\namusement. I know that they are sensitive on the subject, and ought not\r\nto be laughed at; but as they probably will not see this, or if they do,\r\nwill have forgotten the circumstance, I offer for the 'gossip' the\r\nfollowing fair specimen. On the day we crossed the Mississippi and\r\ncaptured the rebels, who had adopted the skedaddling policy of the\r\nFleet-Footed Villain Floyd, we were drawn up in line of battle three\r\ntimes, and three times ye rebs right-faced and 'moseyed.' The last time\r\nit was just at dusk, and we were standing in the edge of an opening,\r\nexpecting to be opened upon by artillery from the other side, which it\r\nwas too dark for us to see distinctly. As we were not fired upon, a\r\nparty was sent forward to reconnoitre, and returned with the\r\nintelligence that they had again evacuated. On learning this, one of our\r\nfellows, brief in stature, but of prodigious red beard, spluttered\r\nthrough his moustache: 'Der tam successionish! dey left vor _un-parts\r\nknown_! Donner-wetter!!'\r\n\r\nHere is another of DICK'S, which dates from the days 'before\r\nCorinth'--for he was one of those to whom it was _licet adire\r\nCorinthum_:\r\n\r\n'Let me tell you a 'goak' that General Pope got off on us, and which we\r\ntake as quite a compliment. Our colonel commanding brigade asked\r\npermission to take two days' rations, as we were going out to 'clean\r\nout' a rebel force that was in a swamp, keeping our men from repairing\r\nthe road and building a bridge for the passage of artillery, and he\r\ndidn't know how long we would have to be gone. 'My God! Colonel,' said\r\nGeneral Pope, 'when you take one day's rations, you are gone four. If I\r\nlet you take two, I wouldn't see you again this side of Memphis.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a brother of the press for the following jotting\r\ndown:\r\n\r\nOur magazine contemporaries, who appear like Neptune among the Tritons,\r\n_i. e._, with the Sea Sons, are sometimes funnily miscomprehended. Thus,\r\nthe publishers of the Methodist _Quarterly Review_ say that a brother\r\nwrites to them complaining that he has not received the February,\r\nMarch, and May numbers of the Review!\r\n\r\nAbout as touching was the complaint of another 'Constant Reader,' who\r\nwrote to the editor of similar quadrennial, complaining that, although\r\nit was a quarterly review, the agent made him pay a half a dollar for\r\nit!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDo you, excellent and all remembering reader, recall an article in our\r\nAugust number entitled, 'Friends of the Future'?

This one discourseth of the little ones:\r\n\r\n   GLENDALE, Wis., _Sept. 16th, 1862_.\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: We rejoice, most of the time, in a house pet, a human\r\npuppet, a domestic toy, in the shape of 'DONNY.' Would you ever believe\r\nthat that name had been originally CHARLES, and passed, by the subtle\r\nalchemy of nicknames, to its present form?\r\n\r\nDONNY lately donned for the first time his first suit of jacket and\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nNo one was in the house save the half-blind nurse who put them on. And\r\npoor DONNY wished so much to be admired! 'All dressed up and nobody to\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\nAn idea struck him. He 'paddled off' for the hennery. I was behind the\r\nbushes and noted him. Walking in a great state before a party of hens,\r\nhe cried aloud:\r\n\r\n'LOOK AT ME, CHICKENS!'\r\n\r\nI should possibly have forgotten this domestic legend, but that it was\r\nrecalled yesterday by the fact that our Cousin JOE made a good\r\napplication of it. There is a very well-educated and very able young\r\ntheological friend of ours, who has this one weakness--when he has read\r\na book, or taken in a new idea of any kind, he can get no rest until he\r\nhas fully reproduced it in a 'bold-face, full-display, double-lead' sort\r\nof manner to somebody else. Show it off he must, and exhibit himself at\r\nthe same time. His last acquisition was a mass of entomology--he having\r\nhad by some means access to a copy of 'Harris on Insects Injurious to\r\nVegetation; and this he reproduced liberally, during an entire evening,\r\nto half a dozen undeveloped intellects of tender age. How the words came\r\nout--how he _did_ give them the Latin!\r\n\r\n'What did you think of him?' I inquired of JOE.\r\n\r\n'LOOK AT ME, CHICKENS!' was the reply. I saw the point--wonder if I\r\nshan't see its application frequently ere I have 'wound up my worsted,'\r\nand shovelled up the mortal coal of this life.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many men, dear CONTINENTAL, who quite unwittingly are\r\never crying aloud, 'Look at me, chickens.' After all, 'tis only the old\r\nfable of the lion cubasinized.\r\n\r\n   Thine ever,\r\n\r\n   CHICKENS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur Chicago friend, J.M., will accept our thanks for his favor. Chicago\r\nis a warm friend to our Magazine.\r\n\r\nEDITOR OF CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_,--Occasionally a 'good thing' comes up to illustrate this\r\nwicked rebellion, which all patriots are striving to put down, in our\r\nonce happy land. When the news of the taking of New Orleans reached our\r\ncity, a friend meeting on the street another, who, like our worthy\r\nPresident, is fond of a good story, spake as follows:\r\n\r\n'Wonder what Jeff. Davis will think now?'\r\n\r\n'It reminds me of a little story,' was the answer.\r\n\r\n'Fire away then.'\r\n\r\n'When Ethan Allen was a prisoner of war in London, a party of wags, who\r\nhad made his acquaintance, and who were pleased with his drolleries, and\r\nwho were in the habit of giving him dinners for the pleasure of his\r\ncompany, discovered in him a marvellous great fondness for pickles. On\r\nthis platform they procured some East India peppers--which are about as\r\nhot as live hickory coals--and placed them in front of his seat at\r\ntable, in as tempting a position as possible: which done, they sat down\r\nto dinner. While the first course was being served, Allen could not\r\nrestrain his love for the article; and very quietly transferred one of\r\nthem from the plate to his mouth, giving it a quick pressure of the jaws\r\nfor the purpose of hastily disposing of it; when, lo and behold! instead\r\nof the luscious vegetable he so much enjoyed, he found he had taken into\r\nhis capacious mouth something about as hot and burning as fire itself.\r\nTo relieve his agony, he applied his hand to his mouth, at the same time\r\nusing his napkin to remove the tears and perspiration, and also conceal\r\nthe contractions of his face, when, hastily casting a glance around the\r\ntable, he at once discovered the point of the joke in the countenances\r\nof those around him. Summoning all his coolness for the instant, he very\r\ndeliberately deposited the 'pesky' thing in his hand, and then returned\r\nit to the plate with all the gravity he could command, remarking at the\r\nsame time, 'With your permission, gentlemen, I will put _that_ d--d\r\nthing back!'\r\n\r\nWhether Jeff. Davis and his satellites would not like to perform the\r\nsame operation with their pet dogma, Secession, I leave for your readers\r\nto decide; remarking that, in my own opinion, they would sleep better if\r\nthey were back again, as in 1860. Prisons and halters are not pleasant\r\nto reflect on and anticipate, particularly when they are remarkably well\r\ndeserved, as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld ETHAN ALLEN! Would he were alive again! Oh, for one hour of that\r\nDUNDEE! Well, the time will answer its own needs, and this war will not\r\npass by without its man of iron. He cometh! Who is he to be? GEORGE\r\nMCCLELLAN, you have it in you!\r\n\r\nPut on steam, and win us the great victory of all time!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShould any man ever collect into a volume all the stories told of the\r\ngreat American showman, we trust that he will not omit the following:\r\n\r\nBARNUM'S PIGEON.\r\n\r\nBarnum sat in his office. It was a warm summer afternoon, but the B was\r\nbusy, as usual. He had before him a plan for exhibiting the great\r\nGuyascutus on improved principles, a letter from a man who owned a wife\r\nwith three arms (to be had cheap), and another from the fortunate\r\nproprietor of the great Singing Pig. An offer or petition from the great\r\n'ex' J---- s B---- n to lecture cheaply had been considered and\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n'He's played out!' was the brief reflection of Barnum. As he said this\r\nthe door opened, and there entered a manifest German, who bore a covered\r\ncage.\r\n\r\n'Vat you bedinks of _dat!_ exclaimed the Deutscher, removing the cloth.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful bird; of perfect pigeon shape, but of an exquisite\r\ngolden yellow lustre, such as no fowl which Mr. Barnum had ever\r\nseen--and his ornithological observations had not been limited--ever\r\nwore.\r\n\r\n'I sells her dretful cheap,' remarked the bearer, '_verflucht_ cheap. I\r\ngifs him to you for 'pout den or sieben thaler.'\r\n\r\n'H'm--no--don't want it,' replied Barnum.\r\n\r\n'Den I goes down mit mine brice to five thaler and dere I stops.'\r\n\r\n'No--got birds enough,' said Barnum. 'They don't pay. Now, if it was the\r\ngreat Japanese earthworm, a yard long--'\r\n\r\n'Goot py. I sorry you no pys it. I dinks I colored her foost rate.'\r\n\r\n'Ha!--_what!_--HOW!' cried Barnum, deeply interested; 'artificially\r\ncolored! Good! _I must have_ that!'\r\n\r\nThe German smiled a heavy, beery, winky, Limburgy smile, with both eyes\r\nshut tightly.\r\n\r\n'Yas, I golors de bichin yellows unt creen and plue unt all sorts\r\ngolors. Only five thalers der piece.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think,' said Mr. Barnum, 'that you could prepare a great\r\nPatriotic National Lusus Naturæ, recently found perching on Independence\r\nHall, Philadelphia--or hold--that's better--Mount Vernon? Could you\r\ncolor an eagle, with red stars on his breast, and blue and white\r\nstripes running down big tail?'\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman thought he could, if the eagle's bill were tied, and his\r\nclaws each stuck into a cork.\r\n\r\n'Well, try your hand at it. But hold--go up stairs and put the pigeon\r\ninto the Happy Family.'\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman stumped away. In about ten minutes Mr. Feathers, the\r\nornithologist of the Museum, came rushing down, in a wild state of\r\nfluttering excitement.\r\n\r\n'Good GOD, Mr. Barnum, you're not going to put _that_ bird into the\r\nHappy Family!'\r\n\r\n'Why not?' inquired Mr. Barnum, serenely.\r\n\r\n'Why--it is the greatest curiosity you own. Heavens! a YELLOW pigeon!\r\nSir, it is an anomaly--an undiscovered rarity--a--a--why, sir, it's an\r\n_incredibility_! I say, to my shame, I never heard of it. From\r\nAustralia, I presume? There are some undiscovered marvels still left in\r\nthat queer country.'\r\n\r\n'No; it's the California golden pigeon.' ('That will take very well,'\r\nquoth Barnum to himself.)\r\n\r\nSo the pigeon went up to the Happy Family, and entered cordially into\r\nthe innocent amusements of that blessed band. He sat on the cat's head,\r\nand on the dog's back, and suffered the mice to nestle under his wings,\r\nand never made them afraid. As for the owl, she fairly made love to him.\r\n\r\nTime rolled on.\r\n\r\nThere came to New York ' a great old boy,' in the person of California\r\nGrizzly Bear Adams. 'Old Adams' he liked to be called, though he wasn't\r\nvery aged. He was 'one of 'em.'\r\n\r\n'See here, Barnum,' quoth he one day, in his rough voice; 'you've got a\r\nbird in your show which I've got to have. It's the Californy golden\r\npigin. It's a sort o' mine anyhow--mine's a show of Californy critters,\r\nand nothing else.'\r\n\r\n'You can't have _that_, Adams,' said Mr. Barnum. ' That's the greatest\r\ncuriosity in the known world. Nothing like it--unique.'\r\n\r\n'Sha--a--aw!' was the reply. 'Stuff! Don't run more o' that con-tusive\r\nstuff on me. _Rare!!_ here he winked; '_why, I've seen them yallar\r\npigeons, three and four hundred in a flock_, up round Los Angeles and\r\nCabeza del Diablo, and them places. The miners find where the gold is,\r\nby 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you bring some on with you?' inquired Barnum.\r\n\r\n'Fact was, they were so everlastin' common that it didn't seem to me\r\nthey were worth bringin'. Why, you can git a dozen of 'em any day in\r\n'Frisco.'\r\n\r\nWith much feigned reluctance Barnum yielded his pigeon up to the\r\nCalifornia show, and all went well--for a time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps two weeks had elapsed, when Old Adams burst into the office,\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n'Barnum!' he cried, 'you infarnal old humbug--that California golden\r\npigin is a darned swindle! It's painted!'\r\n\r\n'Why, how you talk!' replied Barnum. 'Humbug, indeed! Haven't you seen\r\ngolden pigeons, three and four hundred in a flock, in California?'\r\n\r\n'It's painted and gilded, I tell you!' cried Adams. 'The color is all\r\ncoming off the edges of the wings, and its tail is 'most rubbed white!'\r\n\r\n'The idea!' replied Barnum, mildly, but with a droll, merry light in his\r\neyes. 'You know you can send out to the San Francisco market any day and\r\nget a dozen!'\r\n\r\nThat is the legend of Ye Golden Pigeon. No--hold on; it is told in the\r\nMuseum that one day a lady charged Mr. Barnum with having had his Angel\r\nFish artificially colored.\r\n\r\n'Indigo,' she remarked.\r\n\r\nBut the golden pigeon captivated her, and she implored Mr. B. for one of\r\nits eggs. He evaded the request on the ground that the 'sect' to which\r\nthe pigeon belonged was not of the egg-laying kind.\r\n\r\nSo we should think. Apropos of the Angel Fish, the CONTINENTAL heard a\r\nlady remark lately that they were well named, and lovely enough to have\r\nbeen caught in the ponds of paradise. 'They certainly must be the kind,'\r\nshe added, 'which they fish for with golden hooks.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd ah! the merry summer-tide!' as a Minnisinger and many another singer\r\nhave sung. As we write, summer is losing its last traces in the\r\npeach-time of September. Bartlett pears are dead ripe--like the\r\nengagements formed at Newport and Saratoga--and china-asters and\r\ntuberoses tell of coming frosts. Well, 'tis over--the second season of\r\nthe year is with the snows of year before last.\r\n\r\n   'Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan!'\r\n\r\nand we may continue the service by singing a\r\n\r\n   LAMENT FOR SUMMER\r\n\r\n   BY J. W. LEEDS.\r\n\r\n   Like an argosy deep laden\r\n     With the wealth of Indian sands,\r\n   Sailing down a summer ocean\r\n     To far-off Northern lands,--\r\n\r\n   Like a golden-visioned story--\r\n     Like the hectic's bright decay,\r\n   Dying in the painted glory\r\n   Of the autumn sere and hoary,\r\n     Fade the summer days away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPersons who insist that 'after all, the Rebels are slandered as to\r\nwaging warfare in a barbarous manner,' will do well to cast their eyes\r\nover the following from the Richmond _Dispatch_ of September 24:\r\n\r\n\"The Yankees are about to send their army captured at Harper's Ferry\r\nagainst the Indians. Has the Government no means of retaliating for such\r\na breach of faith?'\r\n\r\n'A breach of faith!' So, then, we are to understand that the latest\r\nuprising of the Indians, as well as that led by that brutal Falstaff,\r\nALBERT PIKE, the Southwest, are all in the service of the Confederacy?\r\nFor where is there a breach of faith unless the Indians in question are\r\nthe allies of our Southern foes? This is, we presume, a part of 'the\r\ndefensive policy of exhausting in detail the superior numbers of the\r\ninvading North,' which has been proposed as forming a portion of the\r\nConfederate policy--other items of which consist of killing prisoners by\r\nneglect, and having torpedoes and mines in abandoned villages. We\r\ncommend this admission of alliance with savages to the special\r\nconsideration of the London _Times_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe observe that a new planet has been discovered at Bilk, in Germany.\r\nWell, we have no doubt of the fact, but we don't like the name of the\r\nplace where they found it. A Bilk planet is extremely suggestive of a\r\nMoon hoax. And, talking of hoaxes, has anybody with a sharp stick been\r\nas yet deputed by the government to look after the man who gets up\r\nproposals of peace for the Philadelphia _Inquirer_? Ancient friend of\r\nours, such yarns (unintentionally) do harm. They are reprinted in Dixie,\r\nand the Dixians say that we are frightened, while Northern doughfaces\r\ngrasp at them, and get to thinking. Excellent _Inquirer_! this is not a\r\ngood time to set people to thinking over peace proposals and\r\ncompromises.\r\n\r\nDoes our friend know, by the way, what sort of fowl are hatched from\r\nmares' nests'? They are _canards_. Don't let there be too many of them\r\nhatched in serious times like these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA lady friend, who has brothers in the war, has kindly suggested that,\r\nin these days of patriotism, the songs of the Revolution should have\r\nmore than usual zest, and has kindly copied for us a number, from which\r\nwe select the following:\r\n\r\n   TO THE LADIES.\r\n\r\n   [Published in the Boston _News Letter_, in 1769.]\r\n\r\n   Young ladies in town, and those who live 'round,\r\n     Let a friend at this season advise you,\r\n   Since money's so scarce, and times growing worse,\r\n     Strange things may soon hap to surprise you:\r\n\r\n   First, then, throw aside your top-knots of pride,\r\n     Wear none but your own country linen;\r\n   Of economy boast, let your pride be the most\r\n     To show clothes of your own make and spinning;\r\n\r\n   This do without fear, and to all you'll appear\r\n     Fair, charming, true, lovely and clever;\r\n   Though the times remain darkish, young men may be sparkish,\r\n     And love you much stronger than ever,\r\n\r\nWell! _that_ song is as good now as ever it was; and the next is not far\r\noff from it:\r\n\r\n   WAR SONG.--1776.\r\n\r\n   Hark, hark! the sound of war is heard,\r\n     And we must all attend,\r\n   Take up our arms, and go with speed,\r\n     Our country to defend.\r\n\r\n   Husbands must leave their loving wives,\r\n     And sprightly youths attend,\r\n   Leave their sweethearts and risk their lives,\r\n     Their country to defend.\r\n\r\n   May they be heroes in the field,\r\n     Have heroes' fame in store;\r\n   We pray the Lord to be their shield,\r\n     Where thundering cannons roar.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Ben Zoleen=Benzoline.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThese compounds make available to the people higher attainments of\r\nmedical skill, and more efficient medical aid than has hitherto been\r\nwithin their reach.

Disorders of\r\nthe pulmonary organs are so prevalent and so fatal in our ever-changing\r\nclimate, that a reliable antidote is invaluable to the whole community.\r\nThe indispensable qualities of such a remedy for popular use must be\r\ncertainty of healthy operation, absence of danger from accidental\r\nover-doses, and adaptation to every patient of any age or either sex.\r\nThese conditions have been realized in this preparation, which, while it\r\nreaches to the foundations of disease, and acts with unfailing\r\ncertainty, is still harmless to the most delicate invalid or tender\r\ninfant. A trial of many years has proved to the world that it is\r\nefficacious in curing pulmonary complaints beyond any remedy hitherto\r\nknown to mankind. As time makes these facts wider and better known, this\r\nmedicine has gradually become a staple necessity, from the log cabin of\r\nthe American peasant to the palaces of European kings. Throughout this\r\nentire country--in every State, city, and indeed almost every hamlet it\r\ncontains--the CHERRY PECTORAL is known by its works. Each has living\r\nevidence of its unrivalled usefulness, in some recovered victim, or\r\nvictims, from the threatening symptoms of Consumption. Although this is\r\nnot true to so great an extent abroad, still the article is well\r\nunderstood in many foreign countries to be the best medicine extant\r\nfor distempers of the respiratory organs, and in several of them it is\r\nexclusively used by their most intelligent physicians. In Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Germany, where the medical sciences have reached their\r\nhighest perfection, CHERRY PECTORAL is introduced and in constant use in\r\nthe armies, hospitals, almshouses, public institutions, and in domestic\r\npractice as the surest remedy their attending physicians can employ for\r\nthe more dangerous affections of the lungs. Thousands of cases of\r\npulmonary disease, which had baffled every expedient of human skill,\r\nhave been permanently cured by the CHERRY PECTORAL, and these cures\r\nspeak convincingly to all who know them.\r\n\r\nMany of the certificates of its cures are so remarkable that cautious\r\npeople are led to feel incredulous of their truth, or fear the\r\nstatements are overdrawn. When they consider that each of the remedies\r\nis a specific on which great labor has been expended for years to\r\nperfect it, and when they further consider how much better anything can\r\nbe done which is exclusively followed with the facilities that large\r\nmanufactories afford, then they may see not only what we do, but how we\r\nmake better medicines than have been produced before. Their effects need\r\nastonish no one, when their history is considered with the fact that\r\neach preparation has been elaborated to cure one class of diseases, or,\r\nmore properly, one disease in its many varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nAYER'S CATHARTIC PILLS\r\n\r\nhave been prepared with the utmost skill which the medical profession of\r\nthis age possesses, and their effects show they have virtues which\r\nsurpass any combination of medicines hitherto known. Other preparations\r\ndo more or less good; but this cures such dangerous complaints, so\r\nquickly and so surely, as to prove an efficacy and a power to uproot\r\ndisease beyond anything which men have known before. By removing the\r\nobstructions of the internal organs and stimulating them into healthy\r\naction, they renovate the fountains of life and vigor,--health courses\r\nanew through the body, and the sick man is well again. They are adapted\r\nto disease, and disease only, for when taken by one in health they\r\nproduce but little effect. This is the perfection of medicine, it is\r\nantagonistic to disease and no more. Tender children may take them with\r\nimpunity. If they are sick they will cure them, if they are well they\r\nwill do them no harm.\r\n\r\nGive them to some patient who has been prostrated with bilious\r\ncomplaint: see his bent-up, tottering form straighten with strength\r\nagain; see his long-lost appetite return: see his clammy features\r\nblossom into health. Give them to some sufferer whose foul blood has\r\nburst out in * * till his skin is covered with sores; who stands, or\r\nsits, or lies in anguish. He has been drenched inside and out with every\r\npotion which ingenuity could suggest. Give him these PILLS, and mark the\r\neffect; see the scabs fall from his body; see the new, fair skin that\r\nhas grown under them; see the late leper that is clean. Give them to him\r\nwhose angry humors have planted rheumatism in his joints and bones; move\r\nhim and he screeches with pain; he too has been soaked through every\r\nmuscle of his body with liniments and salves; give him these PILLS to\r\npurify his blood; they may not cure him, for, alas! there are cases\r\nwhich no mortal power can reach; but mark, he walks with crutches now,\r\nand now he walks alone; they have cured him. Give them to the lean,\r\nsour, haggard dyspeptic, whose gnawing stomach has long ago eaten every\r\nsmile from his face and every muscle from his body. See his appetite\r\nreturn, and with it his health; see the new man. See her that was\r\nradiant with health and loveliness bloated and too early withering away;\r\nwant of exercise or mental anguish, or some lurking disease has deranged\r\nthe internal organs of digestion, assimilation, or secretion till they\r\ndo their ill. Her blood is vitiated, her health is gone. Give her these\r\nPILLS to stimulate the vital principle into renewed vigor, to cast out\r\nthe obstructions, and infuse a new vitality into the blend. Now look\r\nagain--the roses blossom on her cheek, and where lately sorrow sat joy\r\nbursts from every feature. See the sweet infant wasted with worms. Its\r\nwan, sickly features tell you without disguise, and painfully distinct,\r\nthat they are eating its life away. Its pinched-up nose and ears and\r\nrestless sleepings tell the dreadful truth in language which every\r\nmother knows. Give it the PILLS in large doses to sweep these vile\r\nparasites from the body. Now turn again and see the ruddy bloom of\r\nchildhood. Is it nothing to do these things? Nay, are they not the\r\nmarvel of this age? And yet they are done around you every day.\r\n\r\nHave you the less serious symptoms of these distempers, they are the\r\neasier cured. Jaundice, Costiveness, Headache, Sideache, Heartburn. Foul\r\nStomach, Nausea, Pain in the Bowels, Flatulency, Loss of Appetite,\r\nKing's Evil, Neuralgia, Gout, and kindred complaints all arise from the\r\nderangements which these PILLS rapidly cure. Take them perseveringly,\r\nand under the counsel of a good physician if you can; if not take them\r\njudiciously by such advice as we give you, and the distressing dangerous\r\ndiseases they cure, which afflict so many millions of the human race,\r\nare cast out like the devils of old--they must burrow in the brutes and\r\nin the sea.\r\n\r\n   Prepared by DE.

ARTHUR and VIRGINIA F. TOWNSEND.\r\n\r\nDevoted to Social Literature, Arts, Morals, Health, and Domestic\r\nHappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of this work from the beginning, has been to unite in one\r\nperiodical the attractions and excellencies of two classes of\r\nmagazines--The Ladies', or Fashion Magazines, as they are called, and\r\nthe literary monthlies; and so to blend the useful with the\r\nentertaining, as to please and benefit all classes of readers. The true\r\n\"Home Magazine\" must have its\r\n\r\n\r\n   TOILETTE and WORK-TABLE DEPARTMENT; its MOTHER'S\r\n   DEPARTMENT; its HEALTH, CHILDREN'S, and HOUSEKEEPER'S\r\n   DEPARTMENTS; as well as its strictly\r\n   LITERARY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these are united in our magazine, and in each department excellence\r\nis sought. Nothing is admitted in any way hurtful to morality, honor, or\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nProbably of no periodical in the country has the press everywhere spoken\r\nwith unqualified approval. From thousands of similar notices we give the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nIt is a Home Magazine in every sense of the word, healthy, fresh, and\r\nsweet--beautiful as the meadows of June. It is a welcome necessity in\r\nour home.--_Journal, Delhi, Iowa._\r\n\r\nIts cheapness makes it accessible to all families, while its literary\r\nmerits are inferior to none of the more expensive magazines.--_Cataract,\r\nCohoes, N.Y._\r\n\r\nArthur has done as much as any man of his age to diffuse good morals and\r\nreligious principles among the young, and his magazine comes forth from\r\nmonth to month like a sower to sow, and scatters the good seed\r\neverywhere.--_Philadelphia Inquirer._\r\n\r\nArthur's Home Magazine is undoubtedly the best publication of its\r\ncharacter, for the price, published in the United States or any other\r\ncountry.--_Independent, Mankato, Minn._\r\n\r\nThis superb ladies' magazine comes fully up to the best standard of a\r\nliterary and fashionable periodical.--_Tellegram, Ottawa, Ohio._\r\n\r\nAny person who cannot get two dollars' worth out of it in a year, will\r\nnever get it in any magazine.--_Independent, Warren, Ill._\r\n\r\nBright, beautiful, and home-like as usual. May its genial presence never\r\nfail to cheer our home.--_Chronicle, Rochester, Ind._\r\n\r\nWe never put down this magazine, but that we feel better for having\r\ntaken it up.--_Union Dem., Deposit, N.Y._\r\n\r\nWe have said so much in favor of Arthur's Magazine that we hardly know\r\nwhat else we can say. It is certainly one of the best and one of the\r\ncheapest.--_Republican, New Oregon, Iowa._\r\n\r\n\r\nELEGANT ENGRAVINGS APPEAR IN EVERY NUMBER,\r\n\r\nIncluding choice pictures, groups, and characters, prevailing Fashions,\r\nand a great variety of needle-work patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITERARY PORTION\r\n\r\nOf the HOME MAGAZINE is of the highest character. The Editors, who write\r\nlargely for its pages, are assisted by liberal contributions from the\r\npens of some of the best writers in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nRARE AND ELEGANT PREMIUMS\r\n\r\nAre sent to all who make up Clubs.--Our Premiums for 1863 are--\r\n\r\n1. A large Photographic copy of that splendid Engraving, \"SHAKSPEARE AND\r\nHIS COTEMPORARIES.\" This copy is made from a proof print, before\r\nlettering, and gives all the details with an accuracy and effect that is\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n2. A large Photographic copy, from an engraving of Huntington's\r\ncelebrated picture, \"MERCY'S DREAM,\" a favorite with every one.\r\n\r\n3. A similar copy of Herring's \"GLIMPSE OF AN ENGLISH HOMESTEAD.\" This\r\npremium was given last year, and was so great a favorite that we\r\ncontinue it on our list for 1863!\r\n\r\n\r\nYEARLY TERMS, IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n    1 copy Home Magazine (and one of the premium plates),  $2 00\r\n    2 copies (and one of the premium plates to getter-up of Club),  8 00\r\n    3 \"   \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  4 00\r\n    4 \"   \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  5 00\r\n    8 \"  (and an extra copy of Magazine, and one premium plate to\r\n                                              getter-up of Club),  10 00\r\n   12 \"  \"  \"  \"  two    \"  \"  \"  \"  15 00\r\n   17 \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  \"  20 00\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that each single subscriber, who pays $2, is entitled to\r\none of the premium plates.\r\n\r\nIn ordering premiums, three red stamps must be sent, in every case, to\r\npay the cost of mailing each premium.\r\n\r\nIt is not required that all the Subscribers to a Club be at the same\r\nPost Office.\r\n\r\nCLUBBING.\r\n\r\nHome Magazine and Godey's Lady's Book, one year, $3 50.

STEINWAY & SONS, of\r\nNew York, are, without doubt, the musical gems of the Exhibition of\r\n1862. They possess a tone that is the most liquid and bell-like we have\r\never heard, and combine the qualities of brilliancy and great power,\r\nwithout the slightest approach to harshness,\" &c.\r\n\r\nMr. HOCHE, one of the most competent musical critics of France, writes\r\nto the \"_Presse Musicale_,\" Paris: \"The firm of STEINWAY & SONS exhibits\r\ntwo pianos, both of which have attracted the special attention of the\r\njurors. The square piano fully possesses the tone of a grand--it sounds\r\nreally marvelously; the ample sound, the extension, the even tone, the\r\nsweetness, the power, are combined in these pianos as in no piano I have\r\never seen. The grand piano unites in itself all the qualities which you\r\ncan demand of a concert piano; in fact, I do not hesitate to say that\r\nthis piano is far better than all the English pianos which I have seen\r\nat the Exhibition,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe \"_Paris Constitutionel_\" says: \"In the piano manufacture the palm\r\ndon't belong to the European industry this year, but to an American\r\nhouse, almost unknown until now, Messrs.

Unlike other preparations, it will not brace up the\r\npatient, but will heal the disease as by magic.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years Mr. Coy was afflicted with a Cough, with\r\nAsthma combined, and at times was laid up for months, unable to do any\r\nthing--given over by his physician, who said that his lungs were badly\r\neffected. After a perseverance of three months in the use of the\r\nPHARMAKON, he is entirely restored to health. Many references could be\r\ngiven, but the medicine is its own best evidence, for it only needs to\r\nbe tried to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, residents of Boston, have known Mr. Coy for a\r\nnumber of years, and can testify that he has had a very severe disease\r\nof the lungs since our acquaintance with him, and have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that we believe he has been cured by the PHARMAKON, and we most\r\ncordially recommend the same as an excellent medicine for all diseases\r\nof the Lungs, Throat, and Liver, and all impurities of the blood.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL NEWELL, 36 HANOVER ST., JOHN L.

They have been proved to be the Soldier's never-failing-friend\r\nin the hour of need.\r\n\r\nCOUGHS AND COLDS AFFECTING TROOPS\r\n\r\nwill be speedily relieved and effectually cured by using these admirable\r\nmedicines, and by paying proper attention to the Directions which are\r\nattached to each Pot or Box.\r\n\r\nSICK HEADACHES AND WANT OF APPETITE, INCIDENTAL TO SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\nThese feelings which so sadden us usually arise from trouble or\r\nannoyances, obstructed perspiration, or eating and drinking whatever is\r\nunwholesome, thus disturbing the healthful action of the liver and\r\nstomach. These organs must be relieved, if you desire to be well. The\r\nPills, taken according to the printed instructions, will quickly produce\r\na healthy action in both liver and stomach, and, as a natural\r\nconsequence, a clear head and good appetite.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS OR DEBILITY INDUCED BY OVER FATIGUE\r\n\r\nwill soon disappear by the use of these invaluable Pills, and the\r\nSoldier will quickly acquire additional strength. Never let the bowels\r\nbe either confined or unduly acted upon. It may seem strange, that\r\nHolloway's Pills should be recommended for Dysentery and Flux, many\r\npersons supposing that they would increase the relaxation. This is a\r\ngreat mistake, for these Pills will correct the liver and stomach, and\r\nthus remove all the acrid humors from the system. This medicine will\r\ngive tone and vigor to the whole organic system, however deranged, while\r\nhealth and strength follow, as a matter of course. Nothing will stop the\r\nrelaxation of the bowels so sure as this famous medicine.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEERS, ATTENTION!

LELAND, HON. FRED. P.\r\nSTANTON, EDMUND KIRKE.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important position it\r\nhas assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the brilliant\r\narray of political and literary talent of the highest order which\r\nsupports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_.--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nBy the accession of HON. ROBERT J. WALKER and HON. F. P. STANTON to its\r\neditorial corps, the CONTINENTAL acquires a strength and a political\r\nsignificance which, to those who are aware of the ability and experience\r\nof these gentlemen, must elevate it to a position far above any\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will at once greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are to become its contributors; and it is no\r\nmere \"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say, that this \"magazine\r\nfor the times\" will employ the first intellect in America, under\r\nauspices which no publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the accomplished scholar and author, who has\r\ntill now been the sole Editor of the Magazine, will, beside his\r\neditorial labors, continue his brilliant contributions to its pages; and\r\nEDMUND KIRKE, author of \"AMONG THE PINES,\" will contribute to each\r\nissue, having already begun a work on Southern Life and Society, which\r\nwill be found far more widely descriptive, and, in all respects,\r\nsuperior to the first.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n   Two copies for one year,       Five dollars.\r\n   Three copies for one year,     Six dollars.\r\n   Six copies for one year,       Eleven dollars.\r\n   Eleven copies for one year,    Twenty dollars.\r\n   Twenty copies for one year,    Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE. _Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.

PUBLISHER FOR THE PROPRIETORS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] As an inducement to new subscribers, the Publisher offers\r\nthe following very liberal premiums:\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Any person remitting $3, in advance, will receive the\r\nMagazine from July, 1862, to January, 1864, thus securing the whole of\r\nMr. KIMBALL'S and Mr. KIRKE'S new serials, which are alone worth the\r\nprice of subscription. Or, if preferred, a subscriber can take the\r\nMagazine for 1863 and a copy of \"AMONG THE PINES,\" or of \"UNDERCURRENTS\r\nOF WALL ST.,\" by R. B. KIMBALL, bound in cloth (the book to be sent\r\npostage paid).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]Any person remitting $4.50, will receive the Magazine from\r\nits commencement, January, 1862, to January, 1864, thus securing Mr.\r\nKIMBALL'S \"WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\" and Mr. KIRKE'S \"AMONG THE PINES\" and\r\n\"MERCHANT'S STORY,\" and nearly 8,000 octavo pages of the best literature\r\nin the world. Premium subscribers to pay their own postage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEQUAL TO ANY IN THE WORLD!!! MAY BE PROCURED At FROM $8 to $12 PER ACRE,\r\n\r\nNear Markets, Schools, Railroads, Churches, and all the blessings of\r\nCivilization.\r\n\r\n1,200,000 Acres, in Farms of 40, 80, 120, 160 Acres and upwards, in\r\nILLINOIS, the Garden State of America.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Central Railroad Company offer, ON LONG CREDIT, the\r\nbeautiful and fertile PRAIRIE LANDS lying along the whole line of their\r\nRailroad, 700 MILES IN LENGTH, upon the most Favorable Terms for\r\nenabling Farmers, Manufacturers, Mechanics and Workingmen to make for\r\nthemselves and their families a competency, and a HOME they can call\r\nTHEIR OWN, as will appear from the following statements:\r\n\r\nILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nIs about equal in extent to England, with a population of 1,732,666, and\r\na soil capable of supporting 20,000,000. No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the state.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 Bushels per-acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrops of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits, large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its enducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiment in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min., (see Mattpon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable community\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n   80 acres at $10 per acre with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n     on the following terms:\r\n   Cash payment  $48 00\r\n   Payment in one year  48 00\r\n   \" in two years   48 00\r\n   \" in three years  48 00\r\n   \" in four years  236 00\r\n   \" in five years  224 00\r\n   \" in six years  212 00\r\n   \" in seven years  300 00\r\n\r\n   40 acres, at $10 00 per acre;\r\n   Cash payment  $24 00\r\n   Payment in one year  24 00\r\n   \" in two years  24 00\r\n   \" in three years  24 00\r\n   \" in four years  118 00\r\n   \" in five years  112 00\r\n   \" in six years  106 00\r\n   \" in seven years  150 00",
