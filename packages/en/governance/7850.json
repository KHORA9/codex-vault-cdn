I.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1836, by\r\n\r\nMATTHEW L. DAVIS,\r\n\r\nin the Clerk's Office of the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a period of forty years I was intimately acquainted with\r\nColonel Burr, and have reason to suppose that I possessed his entire\r\nconfidence. Some time after his return from Europe in 1812, on\r\ndifferent occasions, he suggested casually a wish that I would make\r\nnotes of his _political life_. When the Memoirs and Correspondence of\r\nMr. Jefferson were published, he was much excited at the statements\r\nwhich were made in his Ana respecting the presidential contest in\r\nCongress in 1801.\r\n\r\nHe procured and sent me a copy of the work, with a request that I\r\nwould peruse the parts designated by him. From this time forward he\r\nevinced an anxiety that I would prepare his Memoirs, offering me the\r\nuse of all his private papers, and expressing a willingness to explain\r\nany doubtful points, and to dictate such parts of his early history as\r\nI might require. These propositions led to frequent and full\r\nconversations. I soon discovered that Colonel Burr was far more\r\ntenacious of his _military_, than of his professional, political, or\r\nmoral character. His prejudices against General Washington were\r\nimmoveable. They were formed in the summer of 1776, while he resided\r\nat headquarters; and they were confirmed unchangeably by the injustice\r\nwhich he said he had experienced at the hands of the\r\ncommander-in-chief immediately after the battle of Long Island, and\r\nthe retreat of the American army from the city of New-York. These\r\ngrievances he wished to mingle with his own history; and he was\r\nparticularly anxious to examine the military movements of General\r\nWashington on different occasions, but more especially at the battle\r\nof Monmouth, in which battle Colonel Burr commanded a brigade in Lord\r\nStirling's division. I peremptorily refused entering upon any such\r\ndiscussion; and, for some time, all communication on the subject\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, however, renewed the conversation relative to his\r\nMemoirs, and agreed that any thing which might be written should be\r\nconfined to himself. With this understanding I frequently visited him,\r\nand made notes under his dictation. I never asked him a question on\r\nany subject, or in relation to any man or measure, that he did not\r\npromptly and willingly answer. On his part there was no desire of\r\nconcealment; nor did he ever express to me a wish to suppress an\r\naccount of any act of his whole life. So far as I could judge, his\r\nonly apprehensions were that \"_kind friends_,\" as he sometimes termed\r\nthem, by attempts at explanation, might unintentionally misrepresent\r\nacts which they did not understand.\r\n\r\nI devoted the summer of 1835 to an examination of his letters and\r\npapers, of which there is an immense quantity. The whole of them were\r\nplaced in my hands, to be used at my discretion. I was authorized to\r\ntake from among them whatever I supposed would aid me in preparing the\r\ncontemplated book.\r\n\r\nI have undertaken the work, aware of the delicacy and responsibility\r\nof the task. But, if I know myself, it has been performed with the\r\nmost scrupulous regard to my own reputation for correctness. I have\r\naimed to state facts, and the fair deductions from them, without the\r\nslightest intermixture of personal feeling. I am very desirous that a\r\nknowledge of Mr. Burr's character and conduct should be derived from\r\nhis miscellaneous correspondence, and not from what his biographer\r\nmight write, unsupported by documentary testimony. With this view many\r\nof his private letters are selected for publication.\r\n\r\nI entertain a hope that I shall escape the charge of egotism. I have\r\nendeavoured to avoid _that_ ground of offence, whatever may have been\r\nmy literary sins in other respects. It is proper for me, however, in\r\nthis place, and for a single purpose, to depart from the course\r\npursued in the body of the work. It is a matter of perfect notoriety,\r\nthat among the papers left in my possession by the late Colonel Burr,\r\nthere was a mass of letters and copies of letters written or received\r\nby him, from time to time, during a long life, indicating no very\r\nstrict morality in some of his female correspondents. These letters\r\ncontained matter that would have wounded the feelings of families more\r\nextensively than could be imagined. Their publication would have had a\r\nmost injurious tendency, and created heartburnings that nothing but\r\ntime could have cured.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they came under my control I mentioned the subject to\r\nColonel Burr; but he prohibited the destruction of any part of them\r\nduring his lifetime. I separated them, however, from other letters in\r\nmy possession, and placed them in a situation that made their\r\npublication next to impossible, whatever might have been my own fate.\r\nAs soon as Colonel Burr's decease was known, with my own hands I\r\ncommitted to the fire all such correspondence, and not a vestige of it\r\nnow remains.\r\n\r\nIt is with unaffected reluctance that this statement of facts is made;\r\nand it never would have been made but for circumstances which have\r\ntranspired since the decease of Colonel Burr. A mere allusion to these\r\ncircumstances will, it is trusted, furnish ample justification. No\r\nsooner had the newspapers announced the fact that the Memoirs of\r\nColonel Burr were to be written by me, than I received letters from\r\nvarious quarters of the country, inquiring into the nature of the\r\nrevelations that the book would make, and deprecating the introduction\r\nof individual cases. These letters came to hand both anonymously and\r\nunder known signatures, expressing intense solicitude for suppression.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, am I not only warranted in these remarks,\r\nbut imperiously called upon to make them? What other mode remained to\r\nset the public mind at ease? I have now stated what must for ever\r\nhereafter preclude all possibility for cavil on one part, or anxiety\r\non the other. I _alone_ have possessed the private and important\r\npapers of Colonel Burr; and I pledge my honour that every one of them,\r\nso far as I know and believe, that could have injured the feelings of\r\na female or those of her friends, is destroyed. In order to leave no\r\nchance for distrust, I will add, that I never took, or permitted to be\r\ntaken, a single copy of any of these letters; and, of course, it is\r\nquite impossible that any publication hereafter, if any should be made\r\nof such papers or letters, can have even the pretence of authenticity.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 15th, 1836.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nAncestors of Burr; his father's birth; preparations for the ministry;\r\nthe Rev.

Shortly after his\r\narrival in North America, he settled in Fairfield, Connecticut, where\r\nhe purchased a large tract of land, and reared a numerous family. A\r\npart of this landed estate remained in the possession of his lineal\r\ndescendants until long after the revolutionary war. During Colonel\r\nBurr's travels in Germany, in the year 1809, various communications\r\nwere made to him, orally and in writing, by different branches of the\r\nBurr family, some of whom were then filling high and distinguished\r\nscientific and literary stations.\r\n\r\nHis father, the Rev. Aaron Burr, was born in Fairfield, on the 4th day\r\nof January, 1715, and was educated at Yale College. In a manuscript\r\njournal which he kept, and which has been preserved, he says, \"In\r\nSeptember, 1736, with many fears and doubts about my qualifications\r\n(being under clouds with respect to my spiritual state), I offered\r\nmyself to trials, and was approved as a candidate for the ministry. My\r\nfirst sermon was preached at Greenfield, and immediately after I came\r\ninto the Jerseys. I can hardly give any account why I came here. After\r\nI had preached for some time at Hanover, I had a call by the people of\r\nNewark; but there was scarce any probability that I should suit their\r\ncircumstances, being young in standing and trials. I accepted of their\r\ninvitation, with a reserve, that I did not come with any views of\r\nsettling. My labours were universally acceptable among them, and they\r\nmanifested such great regard and love for me, that I consented to\r\naccept of the charge of their souls.\r\n\r\n\"A.D. 1738-39, January the 25th, I was set apart to the work of the\r\nministry, by fasting, prayer, and imposition of hands. God grant that\r\nI may ever keep fresh upon my mind the solemn charge that was then\r\ngiven me; and never indulge trifling thoughts of what then appeared to\r\nme of such awful importance. The ministers who joined in this solemn\r\ntransaction were Mr. Dickinson, who gave the charge, and Mr. Pierson,\r\nwho preached. Mr. Dickinson, who presided at this work, has been of\r\ngreat service to me by his advice and instruction, both before and\r\nsince my ordination.\r\n\r\n\"In November, 1739, I made a visit to my friends in New-England, and\r\nagain in March, 1740. In the following August gust I was in a\r\ndeclining state of health, and by the advice of my physicians visited\r\nRhode Island. From thence I proceeded to Boston. On the 19th of\r\nSeptember I heard Mr. Whitefield preach in Dr. Colman's church. I am\r\nmore and more pleased with the man. On the 21st, heard him preach in\r\nthe Commons to about ten thousand people. On Monday, visited him, and\r\nhad some conversation to my great satisfaction. On the 23d, went to\r\nhear him preach in Mr. Webb's church, but the house was crowded before\r\nMr. Whitefield came. The people, especially the women, were put into a\r\nfright, under a mistaken notion that the galleries were falling, which\r\ncaused them to hurry out in such a violent manner, that many were\r\nseriously injured and five killed. The same day, Mr. Whitefield\r\npreached at Mr. Gee's church. In the evening he preached at Dr.\r\nSewall's church. On Saturday I went to hear him in the Commons; there\r\nwere about eight thousand hearers. He expounded the parable of the\r\nprodigal son in a very moving manner. Many melted into tears. On the\r\n4th of October, being on my return to New-Jersey, I arrived at\r\nFairfield, where I remained two days with my friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1748, Governor Belcher, of New-Jersey, by and with the\r\napprobation of his Majesty's Council, granted a charter to the college\r\nof New-Jersey, subsequently known as Nassau Hall. This college was\r\nopened in Newark, the students living in private families. The Rev.\r\nAaron Burr was appointed the first president. In the year 1754 or\r\n1755, the trustees commenced erecting the college in Princeton; and in\r\n1757 it was so far completed that the students, about seventy in\r\nnumber, were removed to the building.\r\n\r\nIn, June, 1752, President Burr, being then in his 38th year, was\r\nmarried to Esther Edwards, the daughter of Jonathan Edwards, a\r\ndistinguished metaphysician and divine. He was the second president of\r\nPrinceton College, being called to that station on the decease of his\r\nson-in-law, President Burr. Thus, the father of Colonel Aaron Burr,\r\nand the grandfather on his mother's side, were, in succession, at the\r\nhead of that seminary of learning.\r\n\r\nPresident Burr was alike celebrated for his eloquence and piety; but,\r\nwithal, he possessed no inconsiderable degree of eccentricity. His\r\ncourtship and marriage partook of it. Miss Edwards, after the\r\npreliminaries were arranged, was brought to New-Jersey to be married.\r\nThe occurrence created much conversation, and gave rise to some\r\nnewspaper commentary. The following is extracted from the New-York\r\nGazette of the 20th of July, 1752.\r\n\r\n\"A letter to a gentleman from his friend, dated\r\n\r\n\"July 7th, 1752\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"As you are a known and peculiar votary to the state of celibacy, I\r\njudged it would do you no disservice to acquaint you of a late\r\noccurrence, which sufficiently evidences, that after the most mature\r\nconsideration, some of our wisest and best men do prefer the\r\nendearment of the nuptial bed.\r\n\r\n\"About eight days since, the Rev. Aaron Burr, president of the College\r\nof New-Jersey, was married to a daughter of the renowned Mr. Jonathan\r\nEdwards, late of Northampton. She is a young lady of about twenty-one.\r\nHer person may be called agreeable; her natural genius seems to be\r\nsprightly, and, no doubt, is greatly improved by a very virtuous\r\neducation. In short, she appears to be one every way qualified to make\r\na man of sense and piety happy in the conjugal relation. As to the\r\ncourtship or marriage, I shall not descend to particulars; but only\r\nobserve, in general, that, for some centuries, I suppose there has not\r\nbeen one more in the patriarchal mode.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, sir, that this instance, both as to matter and form, will\r\nhave its genuine influence upon you, and as well bear a part in\r\nconvincing you that wedlock is incomparably preferable to the roving\r\nuneasiness of the single state, as to direct you, when you are\r\nchoosing your mate, that, instead of acting the modern gallant, wisely\r\nto imitate this example, and endeavour to restore courtship and\r\nmarriage to their original simplicity and design.\r\n\r\n\"PHILOGAMUS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt different times Colonel Burr received friendly anonymous and other\r\ncommunications, recommending to him the practice of a religious life.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that in almost every such instance he is\r\nreferred to the letters of his mother. From a communication to him,\r\nwritten by a lady, the following is extracted. If it should meet her\r\neye, as it probably will, it is hoped that she will pardon this\r\nfreedom. Her name is suppressed, and will not be known, unless through\r\nher own instrumentality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I trust the purity of the motives by which I am actuated will find an\r\napology in your bosom for the liberty I assume in addressing you on a\r\nsubject which involves your eternal interest.\r\n\r\n\"Here, in the wilds of -----, I have found an extract of a letter,\r\nwritten by your inestimable mother nearly sixty years ago, of which\r\nyou are the principal subject; and a transcript of which I shall\r\nenclose for your perusal. Perhaps you will think me a weak,\r\npresumptuous being; but permit me, dear sir, to assure you, this does\r\nnot proceed from a whim of the moment. It is not a mere transient gust\r\nof enthusiasm. The subject has long been heavy on my mind. I have more\r\nthan once resolved to converse with you freely; to tell you how my own\r\nfeelings were affected relative to your situation; but my faltering\r\ntongue refused to obey the impulse of my soul, and I have withdrawn\r\nabruptly, to conceal that which I had not confidence to communicate.\r\nBut meeting (I believe providentially) with this precious relic has\r\ndetermined me. I will write, and transmit it to you. I am too well\r\nconvinced of the liberality of your sentiments; but I still believe\r\nyou retain an inherent respect for the religion of your forefathers.\r\n\r\n\"I have often reflected on your trials, and the fortitude with which\r\nyou have sustained them, with astonishment. Yours has been no common\r\nlot. But you seem to have forgotten the right use of adversity.\r\nAfflictions from Heaven 'are angels sent on embassies of love.' We\r\nmust improve, and not abuse them, to obtain the blessing. They are\r\ncommissioned to stem the tide of impetuous passion; to check\r\ninordinate ambition; to show us the insignificance of earthly\r\ngreatness; to wean our affections from transitory things, and elevate\r\nthem to those realities which are ever blooming at the right hand of\r\nGod. When affliction is thus sanctified, 'the heart at once it humbles\r\nand exalts.'\r\n\r\n\"Was it philosophy that supported you in your trials? There is an hour\r\napproaching when philosophy will fail, and all human science will\r\ndesert you. What then will be your substitute? Tell me, Colonel Burr,\r\nor rather answer it to your own heart, when the pale messenger\r\nappears, how will you meet him--'undamped by doubts, undarkened by\r\ndespair?'\r\n\r\n\"The enclosed is calculated to excite mingled sensations both of a\r\nmelancholy and pleasing nature. The hand that penned it is now among\r\n'the just made perfect.' Your mother had given you up by faith. Have\r\nyou ever ratified the vows she made in your behalf? When she bade you\r\na long farewell, she commended you to the protection of Him who had\r\npromised to be a father to the fatherless.\" The great Augustine, in\r\nhis early years, was an infidel in his principles, and a libertine in\r\nhis conduct, which his pious mother deplored with bitter weeping. But\r\nshe was told by her friends that 'the child of so many prayers, and\r\ntears could not be lost;' and it was verified to her happy experience,\r\nfor he afterward became one of the grand luminaries of the church of\r\nChrist. This remark has often been applied to you; and I trust you\r\nwill yet have the happiness to find that 'the prayers of the\r\nrighteous' have 'availed much.'\r\n\r\n\"One favour I would ask: when you have done with this, destroy it,\r\nthat it may never meet the eye of any third person. In the presence of\r\nthat God, before whom the inmost recesses of the heart are open, I\r\nhave written. I consulted him, and him only, respecting the propriety\r\nof addressing it to you; and the answer he gave was, freedom in\r\nwriting, with a feeling of the deepest interest impressed upon my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Z. Y\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To Col. A. BURR.\"\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MRS. BURR TO HER FATHER, PRESIDENT EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n\"Princeton, Nov. 2, 1757.\r\n\r\n\"Honoured Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your most affectionate, comforting letter, by my brother, was\r\nexceedingly refreshing to me, although I was somewhat damped that I\r\nshould not see you until spring. But it is my comfort in this\r\ndisappointment, as well as under all my afflictions, that God knows\r\nwhat is best for me and for his own glory. Perhaps I depended too much\r\non the company and conversation of such a near, and dear, and\r\naffectionate father and guide. I cannot doubt but all is for the best,\r\nand I am satisfied that God should order the affair of your removal as\r\nshall be for his glory, whatever comes of me. Since I wrote my\r\nmother's letter, God has carried me through new trials, and given me\r\nnew supports. My little son [1] has been sick with the slow fever ever\r\nsince my brother left us, and has been brought to the brink of the\r\ngrave. But I hope, in mercy, God is bringing him up again. I was\r\nenabled to resign the child (after a severe struggle with nature) with\r\nthe greatest freedom. God showed me that the child was not my own, but\r\nhis, and that he had a right to recall what he had lent whenever he\r\nthought fit; and I had no reason to complain, or say God dealt hard\r\nwith me. This silenced me. But how good is God! He hath not only kept\r\nme from complaining, but comforted me, by enabling me to offer up the\r\nchild by faith. I think, if ever I acted faith, I saw the fullness\r\nthere was in Christ for little infants, and his willingness to accept\r\nof such as were offered to him. 'Suffer little children to come unto\r\nme, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God,' were\r\ncomforting words. God also showed me, in such a lively manner, the\r\nfullness that was in himself of all spiritual blessings, that I said,\r\nAlthough all streams were cut off, yet, so long as my God lives, I\r\nhave enough. He enabled me to say--'Although thou slay me, yet will I\r\ntrust in thee.' In this time of trial I was led to enter into a\r\nrenewed and explicit covenant with God, in a more solemn manner than\r\never before, and with the greatest freedom and delight. After much\r\nself-examination and prayer, I did give up myself and children to God\r\nwith my whole heart. Never, until now, had I a sense of the privilege\r\nwe are allowed in covenanting with God! This act of my soul left my\r\nmind in a quiet and steady trust in God. A few days after this, one\r\nevening, in talking of the glorious state my dear departed must be in,\r\nmy soul was carried out in such longing desires after this glorious\r\nstate, that I was forced to retire from the family to conceal my joy.\r\nWhen alone, I was so transported, and my soul carried out in such\r\neager desires after perfection, and the full enjoyment of God, and to\r\nserve him uninterruptedly, that I think my nature would not have borne\r\nmuch more. I think I had that night a foretaste of Heaven. This frame\r\ncontinued, in some good degree, the whole night. I slept but little;\r\nand when I did, my dreams were all of heavenly and divine things.\r\nFrequently since I have felt the same in kind, though not in degree.\r\nThus a kind and gracious God has been with me in six troubles, and in\r\nseven. But, oh! Sir, what cause of deep humiliation and abasement of\r\nsoul have I, on account of remaining corruption which I see working,\r\nespecially pride! Oh, how many shapes does pride cloak itself in!\r\nSatan is also busy shooting his darts; but, blessed be God, those\r\ntemptations of his that used to overthrow me, as yet, have not touched\r\nme. Oh to be delivered from the power of Satan as well as sin! I\r\ncannot help hoping the time is near. God is certainly fitting me for\r\nhimself; and when I think it will be soon that I shall be called\r\nhence, the thought is transporting.\r\n\r\n\"Your dutiful and affectionate daughter,\r\n\r\n\"Esther Burr.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the parents of Colonel Aaron Burr. Of the natural\r\nguardianship and protection of both he was deprived before he had\r\nreached the third year of his age. He was born on the 6th of February,\r\n1756, in Newark, State of New-Jersey. His father died in August, 1757,\r\nand his mother the year following, leaving two children, Aaron, and\r\nhis sister Sarah. She subsequently became the wife of Judge Tappan\r\nReeve, of Connecticut. On the decease of his father, Colonel Burr\r\ninherited a handsome estate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760 Aaron was sent to Philadelphia, under the care of an\r\naunt and Dr. Shippen. For the family of the doctor he entertained a\r\nhigh degree of respect. He frequently spoke of them in the kindest\r\nterms, and recurred to this early period of his history with emotions\r\nof gratitude for their care and protection.\r\n\r\nBoswell, in his Life of Johnson, remarks that, \"In following so very\r\neminent a man from his cradle to his grave, every minute particular\r\nwhich can throw light on the progress of his mind, is interesting.\"\r\nJohnson himself, in the Life of Sydenham, says \"There is no instance\r\nof any man, whose history has been minutely related, that did not, in\r\nevery part of life, discover the same proportion of intellectual\r\nvigour.\"\r\n\r\nThese high authorities are now quoted in justification of some of the\r\ndetails which will be given in the progress of this work, and which,\r\nin themselves, may appear trifling and unimportant. When Aaron was\r\nabout four years old, he had some misunderstanding with his preceptor,\r\nin consequence of which he ran away, and was not found until the third\r\nor fourth day after his departure from home; thus indicating, at a\r\ntender age, that fearlessness of mind, and determination to rely upon\r\nhimself, which were characteristics stamped upon every subsequent act\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Col. Burr, at that time about twenty months old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1761 he was removed to Stockbridge, in Massachusetts, and placed in\r\nthe family of Timothy Edwards, his mother's eldest brother. In 1762\r\nhis maternal uncle, Timothy, removed to Elizabethtown, New-Jersey.\r\nAaron and his sister Sarah remained in the family until the former\r\nentered college, and the latter became the wife of Judge Reeve. A\r\nprivate tutor was employed for them in the house of Mr. Edwards. For a\r\nconsiderable portion of the time, Judge Reeve was engaged in that\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nWhen about ten years old, Aaron evinced a desire to make a voyage to\r\nsea; and, with this object in view, ran away from his uncle Edwards,\r\nand came to the city of New-York. He entered on board an outward-bound\r\nvessel as cabin-boy. He was, however, pursued by his guardian, and his\r\nplace of retreat discovered. Young Burr, one day, while busily\r\nemployed, perceived his uncle coming down the wharf, and immediately\r\nran up the shrouds, and clambered to the topgallant-mast head. Here he\r\nremained, and peremptorily refused to come down, or be taken down,\r\nuntil all the preliminaries of a treaty of peace were agreed upon. To\r\nthe doctrine of unconditional submission he never gave his assent.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Burr entered Princeton College; where, owing to his extreme\r\nyouth and smallness of stature, he was forced to commence with the\r\nsophomore, although, upon examination, he was found qualified to enter\r\nthe junior class. This was a source of extreme mortification to him,\r\nand especially as he had been prepared, and was every way qualified,\r\nto enter the preceding year. From his infancy Burr was of a slender\r\nframe, and appeared to be delicately formed; but exhibited great\r\nmuscular strength, and was able to endure excessive fatigue of body\r\nand mind.\r\n\r\nPrevious to entering college, young Burr had formed extraordinary\r\nnotions of the acquirements of collegiates; and felt great\r\napprehension lest he should be found inferior to his classmates. He\r\nwas therefore, at first, indefatigable as well as systematic in his\r\nstudies. He soon discovered that he could not pursue them after dinner\r\nwith the same advantage that he could before. He suspected that this\r\nwas owing to his eating too abundantly. He made the experiment, and\r\nthe result convinced him that his apprehensions were well founded. He\r\nimmediately adopted a system of regimen, to which, in some degree, he\r\nadhered through life. So abstemious was he during the greater part of\r\nthe first year after his entrance into college, that it operated\r\npowerfully upon him, and he was supposed to be in bad health. He was\r\nin the habit of studying sixteen or eighteen hours of the twenty-four,\r\nuntil the period of examination arrived, when he discovered that the\r\nprogress he had made was so much beyond his associates, that he formed\r\nan opinion as contemptuous as it had been exalted of his college\r\nfriends. The effect of this was ultimately very injurious upon his\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year that he remained in college, he passed a life of\r\nidleness, negligence, and, in some measure, of dissipation. He applied\r\nhimself but little to his studies, and was in the constant pursuit of\r\npleasure. He graduated, however, when only sixteen years of age, with\r\na reputation for talents, and receiving the highest academic honours\r\nthe faculty could bestow.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1771-72, there was in the college what was termed, in\r\nreligious phraseology, \"an awakening.\" A large portion of the\r\ncollegians became converted. It was only a short time before Burr\r\ngraduated, and in the midst of his hilarity and amusements. He was\r\nfrequently appealed to by his associates, and threatened with the most\r\nterrific consequences if there was not an inward as well as an outward\r\nchange. From his infancy Burr's education had been strictly moral; and\r\nstrong impressions had been made upon his mind as to the existence of\r\na Deity, and the accountability of man. Yet this awakening did not\r\nseem to him right in all its parts. He determined, therefore, to have\r\na free and full conversation with Dr. Witherspoon, the then president\r\nof the college, on the subject. The result of that conversation in\r\nsome measure tranquillized young Burr. The Rev. Dr. assured him that\r\nit was not true and rational religion, but fanaticism, that was\r\noperating upon his friends.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers preserved by Colonel Burr are the originals of a\r\nnumber of essays or orations, written and read by him, in conformity\r\nwith the regulations of the college, while yet a student. They are\r\nwithout dates; but, as he graduated in 1772, they must have been\r\ncomposed when he was of an age between thirteen and sixteen. A few of\r\nthem are here inserted, as exhibiting his manner of writing, and the\r\nmaturity and tone of his mind. The opinions which he formed, while yet\r\nin college, as to public speaking and the selection of language, he\r\nappears never to have changed. The style which he then recommended\r\nseems ever after to have been his model.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Read in College, by Aaron Burr.--On Style._\r\n\r\n\"I have often observed, that it is very common for those who are\r\nambitious of excelling in composition, to study swelling words,\r\npompous epithets, and laboured periods. This is often practised,\r\nespecially by young writers. It is, however, generally condemned as a\r\nfault, and sometimes too by those who practise it themselves. An\r\nelegant simplicity of language is what every one should strive to\r\nobtain. Besides the arguments which are usually offered on this head,\r\nthere is one very important one, which is commonly not much attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"It is the business of every writer to acquire command of language, in\r\norder that he may be able to write with ease and readiness, and, upon\r\nany occasion, to form extempore discourses. Unless he can do this, he\r\nwill never shine as a speaker, nor will he ever make a figure in\r\nprivate conversation. But to do this, it is necessary to study\r\nsimplicity of style. There never was a ready speaker, whose language\r\nwas not, generally, plain and simple; for it is absolutely impossible\r\nto carry the laboured ornaments of language, the round period, or the\r\nstudied epithet, into extempore discourses; and, were it possible, it\r\nwould be ridiculous. We have learned, indeed, partly from reading\r\npoetry, and partly from reading vicious compositions, to endure, and\r\ntoo often to admire, such stiff and laboured discourses in writing;\r\nbut if it were even possible for a man to speak in the same pompous\r\ndiction in which Browne has written his vulgar errors, he would\r\ncertainly be very disagreeable. This reason, among others, may be\r\nassigned for it; that however such false ornaments may please for a\r\ntime, yet, when a long and steady attention is required, we are tired\r\nand disgusted with every thing which increases our labour, and diverts\r\nthe attention from the subject before us. A laboured style is a labour\r\neven to the hearer. A simple style, like simple food, preserves the\r\nappetite. But a profusion of ornament, like a profusion of sweets,\r\npalls the appetite and becomes disgusting. A man might as soon think\r\nof filling his stomach with sweetmeats, as going through a long debate\r\nfilled with pompous epithets and sounding language. If we have any\r\ndoubt of its being ridiculous, let us only suppose a man arguing an\r\nabstruse subject in metaphysics, in the blank verse of Milton, or the\r\nexact rhymes of Pope. The absurdity is the same, only different in\r\ndegree. I would not be understood to cut off an extempore speaker from\r\nsublime expressions; because I do not suppose these to be inconsistent\r\nwith simplicity of style. I really doubt if there be any such thing as\r\nsublimity of style, strictly speaking. But, indeed, rather believe\r\nthat the sublime depends upon the thoughts, which are the more sublime\r\nby being clearly and simply expressed, This, however, is not material\r\nat present. It is certainly impossible for a speaker to carry laboured\r\nperiods into his extempore discourses: it is no less certain, that in\r\ngeneral, a simple style is to be preferred, and that he would be\r\nridiculous and disagreeable if he could do it; and as extempore\r\nspeaking is a great object, which we ought to have in view in the\r\nformation of our style, this may be used as one argument why we should\r\nstudy a simple style.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Passions_.\r\n\r\n\"Amid the variety of literary pieces which have in all ages been\r\nushered into the world, few, if any, afford greater satisfaction than\r\nthose that treat of man. To persons of a speculative nature and\r\nelegant taste, whose bosoms glow with benevolence, such disquisitions\r\nare peculiarly delightful. The reason, indeed, is obvious; for what\r\nmore necessary to be learned and accurately understood? what more near\r\nand interesting? and, therefore, what more proper to engage the\r\nattention? Well may I say, with our ethic poet,\r\n\r\n    \"'The proper study of mankind is man.'\r\n\r\n\"If we take a view of the body only, which may be called the shell or\r\nexternal crust, we shall perceive it to be formed with amazing nicety\r\nand art. How are we lost in wonder when we behold all its component\r\nparts; when we behold them, although various and minute, and blended\r\ntogether almost beyond conception, discharging their peculiar\r\nfunctions without the least confusion. All harmoniously conspiring to\r\none grand end.\r\n\r\n\"But when we take a survey of the more sublime parts of the human\r\nframe; when we behold man's internal make and structure; his mental\r\nfaculties; his social propensions, and those active powers which set\r\nall in motion--the passions,--what an illustrious display of\r\nconsummate wisdom is presented to our admiring view! What brighter\r\nmark--what stronger evidence need we of a God? The scanty limits of a\r\nfew minutes, to which I am confined, would not permit me, were I equal\r\nto the task, to enter into a particular examination of all man's\r\ninternal powers. I shall therefore throw out a few thoughts on the\r\npassions only.\r\n\r\n\"Man's mental powers, being in their nature sluggish and inactive,\r\ncannot put themselves in motion. The grand design then of the passions\r\nis, to rouse them to action. These lively and vigorous principles make\r\nus eager in the pursuit of those things that are approved by the\r\njudgment; keep the mind intent upon proper objects, and at once awake\r\nto action all the powers of the soul. The passions give vivacity to\r\nall our operations, and render the enjoyments of life pleasing and\r\nagreeable. Without them, the scenes of the world would affect us no\r\nmore than the shadowy pictures of a morning dream.\r\n\r\n\"Who can view the works of nature, and the productions of art, without\r\nthe most sublime and rapturous emotions? Who can view the miseries of\r\nothers, without being dissolved into compassion? Who can read human\r\nnature, as represented in the histories of the world, without burning\r\nto chastise the perpetrators of tyranny, or glowing to imitate the\r\nassertors of freedom? But, were we of a sudden stripped of our\r\npassions, we should survey the works of nature and the productions of\r\nart with indifference and neglect. We should be unaffected with the\r\ncalamities of others, deaf to the calls of pity, and dead to all the\r\nfeelings of humanity. Without generosity, benevolence, or charity, man\r\nwould be a groveling, despicable creature. Without the passions, man\r\nwould hardly rank above the beasts.\r\n\r\n\"It is a trite truth, that the passions have too much influence over\r\nour sentiments and opinions. It is the remark of a late author, that\r\nthe actions and sentiments of men do as naturally follow the lead of\r\nthe passions, as the effect does the cause. Hence they are, by some,\r\naptly enough, termed the principles of action. Vicious desires will\r\nproduce vicious practices; and men, by permitting themselves to think\r\nof indulging irregular passions, corrupt the understanding, which is\r\nthe source of all virtue and morality. The passions, then, if properly\r\nregulated, are the gentle gales which keep life from stagnating; but,\r\nif let loose, the tempests which tear every thing before them. Too\r\nfatal observation will evince the truth of this.\r\n\r\n\"Do we not frequently behold men of the most sprightly genius, by\r\ngiving the reins to their passions, lost to society, and reduced to\r\nthe lowest ebb of misery and despair? Do we not frequently behold\r\npersons of the most penetrating discernment and happy turn for polite\r\nliterature, by mingling with the sons of sensuality and riot, blasted\r\nin the bloom of life? Such was the fate of the late celebrated Duke of\r\nWharton, Wilmot, earl of Rochester, and Villers, duke of Buckingham,\r\nthree noblemen, as eminently distinguished by their wit, taste, and\r\nknowledge, as for their extravagance, revelry, and lawless passions.\r\nIn such cases, the most charming elocution, the finest fancy, the\r\nbrightest blaze of genius, and the noblest burst of thoughts, call for\r\nlouder vengeance, and damn them to lasting infamy and shame.\r\n\r\n\"A greater curse cannot, indeed, befall community, than for princes\r\nand men in eminent departments to be under the influence of\r\nill-directed passions. Lo Alexander and Cesar, the fabled heroes of\r\nantiquity, to what lengths did passion hurry them? Ambition, with look\r\nsublime, bade them on, bade them grasp at universal dominion, and wade\r\nto empire through seas of blood! But why need I confine myself to\r\nthese? Do not provinces, plundered and laid waste with fire and sword;\r\ndo not nations, massacred and slaughtered by the bloody hand of war;\r\ndo not all these dreadful and astonishing revolutions, recorded in the\r\npages of history, show the fatal effects of lawless passions?\r\n\r\n\"If the happiness of others could not, yet surely our own happiness\r\nshould induce us to keep our passions within the bounds of reason; for\r\nthe passions, when unduly elevated, destroy the health, impair the\r\nmental faculties, sour the disposition, embitter life, and make us\r\nequally disagreeable to others and uneasy to ourselves. Is it not,\r\nthen, of moment, that our passions be duly balanced, their sallies\r\nconfined within proper limits, and in no case suffered to transgress\r\nthe bounds of reason? Will any one deny the importance of regulating\r\nthe passions, when he considers how powerful they are, and that his\r\nown happiness, and perhaps the happiness of thousands, depends upon\r\nit? The regulation of the passions is a matter of moment, and\r\ntherefore we should be careful to fix them upon right objects, to\r\nconfine them within proper bounds, and never permit them to exceed the\r\nlimits assigned by nature. It is the part of reason to sooth the\r\npassions, and to keep the soul in a pleasing serenity and calm: if\r\nreason rules, all is quiet, composed, and benign: if reason rules, all\r\nthe passions, like a musical concert, are in unison. In short, our\r\npassions, when moderate, are accompanied with a sense of fitness and\r\nrectitude; but, when excessive, inflame the mind, and hurry us on to\r\naction without due distinction of objects.\r\n\r\n\"Among uncivilized nations, the passions do, in general, exceed all\r\nrational bounds. Need we a proof of this? Let us cast our eyes on the\r\ndifferent savage tribes in the world, and we shall be immediately\r\nconvinced that the passions rule without control. Happy it is, that in\r\npolished society, the passions, by early discipline, are so moderated\r\nas to be made subservient to the most important services. In this\r\nrespect, seminaries of learning are of the utmost advantage, and\r\nattended with the most happy effects. Moreover, the passions are\r\nattended with correspondent commotions in animal nature, and,\r\ntherefore, the real temper will, of course, be discovered by the\r\ncountenance, the gesture, and the voice. Here I might run into a\r\npleasing enumeration of many instances of this; but, fearing that I\r\nhave already trespassed upon your patience, shall desist. Permit me,\r\nhowever unusual, to close with a wish. May none of those unruly\r\npassions ever captivate any of my audience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Attempt to search the Origin of Idolatry._\r\n\r\n\"It is altogether impossible to fix exactly the period when idolatry\r\ntook its rise. Adam, coming immediately from the hands of God, had\r\nexperienced too many manifestations of his power and goodness to be\r\nunacquainted with him, and must have preserved the purest idea of him\r\nin his own family, which, most probably, continued in the branch of\r\nSeth till the deluge. The posterity of Cain, on the contrary (the pure\r\nidea of God gradually wearing away, and by loose men being connected\r\nwith sense), fell into idolatry, and every other crime, which brought\r\non the deluge; a period about which Moses has said but little, and\r\nfrom what he has said we can draw no just conclusion with respect to\r\nthe idolatry of those times.\r\n\r\n\"A certain author, being persuaded that idolatry did not take its rise\r\ntill after the deluge, gives a very singular account of its origin.\r\nAccording to him, atheism had spread itself over the world. This\r\ndisposition of mind, says he, is the capital crime. Atheists are much\r\nmore odious to the Divinity than idolaters. Besides, this principle is\r\nmuch more capable of leading men into that excessive corruption the\r\nworld fell into before the deluge. The knowledge of a God, of whatever\r\nnature he is conceived, and the worship of a Deity, are apt, of\r\nthemselves, to be a restraint upon men. So that idolatry was of some\r\nuse to bear down the corruption of the world. It is therefore\r\nprobable, that the horrid vices men were fallen into before the\r\ndeluge, proceeded only from their not knowing nor serving a God. I am\r\neven of opinion (continues he) that the idolatry and polytheism after\r\nthe deluge derived their origin from the atheism and impiety that\r\nreigned before it. Such is the temper of men, when they have been\r\nseverely punished for any crime, they run into the opposite extreme. I\r\nconjecture (concludes the same author) this was the case with men\r\nafter the deluge. As they reckoned that this terrible judgment, which\r\ncarried such indications of Divine wrath, was sent for the punishment\r\nof atheism, they ran into the opposite extreme. They adored whatever\r\nseemed to deserve their worship.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, indeed, that idolatry is capable of furnishing a curb\r\nagainst irregularity of manners; but this author has conjectured,\r\nwithout foundation, that atheism reigned universally before the\r\ndeluge. He ought, at least, to have excepted the posterity of Seth.\r\n\r\n\"However idolatry might have reigned before the deluge, it is certain\r\nthat the knowledge and worship of the true God were again united in\r\nthe family of Noah; and as long as the children and grandchildren of\r\nthat patriarch made but one family, in all probability, the worship of\r\nthe true God was little altered in its purity. Noah being at the head\r\nof the people, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth witnesses of God's vengeance\r\non their contemporaries, is it probable that they, living in the midst\r\nof their families, would suffer them to depart from the truth? We read\r\nof nothing that can incline us to this belief. Various have been the\r\nconjectures concerning the authors of idolatry. Some believe it was\r\nSerug, the grandfather of Terah, who first introduced idolatry after\r\nthe deluge. Others maintain it was Nimrod, and that he instituted the\r\nworship of fire among his subjects, which continues even to this day\r\nin some places in Persia. Others assert that Ham was the author of it,\r\nand then his son Canaan; and it is most probable that the unfortunate\r\nsons of an accursed father were the first who, following the\r\npropensity of their own heart, sought out sensible objects to which\r\nthey might offer a superstitious worship. As the two sons of Ham,\r\nCanaan and Mizraim, settled, the one in Phoenicia, and the other in\r\nEgypt, it is probable that these were the first nurseries of idolatry;\r\nand the sun, being looked upon as the purest image of the Creator, was\r\nthe first object of it. It is not probable that men would choose\r\nbeings like themselves for the first objects of their adoration.\r\nNothing could be more capable of seducing than the beauty and\r\nusefulness of the sun, dispensing light and fertility all around. But,\r\nto conclude, we must not imagine that all idolatry sprang from the\r\nsame country. It came by slow degrees, and those who made the first\r\nadvances towards this impiety, did by no means carry it to that\r\nextravagant height to which it afterwards arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn college, young Burr formed intimacies which ripened into lasting\r\nfriendship. The attachment between him and Colonel Matthias Ogden, of\r\nNew-Jersey, was both ardent and mutual; and, it is believed, continued\r\nduring the life of the latter. Colonel Knapp says, \"Samuel Spring, D.\r\nD., late of Newburyport, was in college with Colonel Burr, and part of\r\ntheir college life was his chum. The doctor was a student of mature\r\nage, and had a provisitorial power over Burr in his daily duties. He\r\nhas often spoken of his young friend with more than ordinary feeling.\r\nHe, in fact, prophesied his future genius, from the early proofs he\r\ngave of intellectual power in the course of his college life.\"\r\n\r\nAt Princeton, Burr enjoyed the counsel and advice of the late William\r\nPaterson, subsequently one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. To be thus early in life honoured with the respect and\r\nesteem of such a man as Judge Paterson, was highly flattering. Their\r\ncorrespondence commenced in 1772, and continued until the decease of\r\nthe judge. Extracts from his letters to Colonel Burr will be given\r\noccasionally. He says, in a letter dated\r\n\r\n\"Princeton, January 17th, 1772.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Burr,\r\n\r\n\"I am just ready to take horse, and therefore cannot have the pleasure\r\nof waiting on you in person. Be pleased to accept of the enclosed\r\nnotes on _dancing_. If you pitch upon it as the subject of your next\r\ndiscourse, they may, perhaps, furnish you with a few hints, and enable\r\nyou to compose with the greater facility and despatch. To do you any\r\nlittle services in my power will afford me great satisfaction, and I\r\nhope you will take the liberty (it is nothing more, my dear Burr, than\r\nthe freedom of a friend) to call upon me whenever you think I can.\r\n\r\n\"When I shall be here again is uncertain--perhaps not before vacation.\r\nForbear with me while I say _that you cannot speak too slow_. Your\r\ngood judgment generally leads you to lay the emphasis on the most\r\nforcible word in the sentence; so far you act very right. But the\r\nmisfortune is, that you lay too great stress upon the emphatical word.\r\nEvery word should be distinctly pronounced; one should not be so\r\nhighly sounded as to drown another. To see you shine as a speaker\r\nwould give great pleasure to your friends in general, and to me in\r\nparticular. I say nothing of your own honour. The desire of making\r\nothers happy will, to a generous mind, be the strongest incentive. I\r\nam much mistaken if such a desire has not great influence over you.\r\nYou are certainly capable of making a good speaker. Exert yourself. I\r\nam in haste.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Burr, adieu.\r\n\r\n\"WM. PATERSON\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter, dated\r\n\r\n\"Princeton, October 26th, 1772.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Burr,\r\n\r\n\"Our mutual friend, Stewart, with whom I spent part of the evening,\r\ninformed me you were still in Elizabethtown. You are much fonder of\r\nthat place than I am, otherwise you would hardly be prevailed upon to\r\nmake so long a stay. But, perhaps, the reason that I fear it, makes\r\nyou like it. There is certainly something amorous in its very air. Nor\r\nis this a case any way extraordinary or beyond belief. I have read\r\n(and it was in point, too) that a flock of birds, being on the wing,\r\nand bending their flight towards a certain town in Connecticut,\r\ndropped down dead just as they were over it. The people were at first\r\nfairly at a loss to account for this phenomenon in any natural way.\r\nHowever, it was at length agreed on all hands that it was owing to the\r\nnoisomeness of the atmosphere, the smallpox at that time being very\r\nrife in the place. I should never have given credit to the report, had\r\nit not come from so good a quarter as that of New-England. For my\r\npart, I always drive through Elizabethtown as quickly as possible,\r\nlest the soft infection should steal upon me, or I should take it in\r\nwith the very air I breathe.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I went to hear Mr. Halsey, and there, too, I saw his young\r\nand blooming wife. The old gentleman seems very fond of his rib, and,\r\nin good sooth, leers very wistfully at her as she trips along by his\r\nside. Some allowance, however, must be made; he is in the vale of\r\nlife; love is a new thing to him, and the honey-moon is not yet over.\r\n  'They are amorous, and fond, and billing,\r\n  Like Philip and Mary on a shilling.'\r\nI have promised to pay him a visit; Stewart, or some of the tutors, I\r\nbelieve, will accompany me, and I hope you will too.\r\n\r\n\"Since commencement I have been at a Dutch wedding, and expect to be\r\nat one or two more very shortly. There was drinking, and singing, and\r\nfiddling, and dancing. I was pleased extremely. Every one seemed to be\r\nin good-humour with himself, and this naturally led them all to be in\r\ngood-humour with one another.\r\n\r\n\"When the itch of scribbling seizes me, I hardly know when to stop.\r\nThe fit, indeed, seldom comes upon me; but when it does, though I sit\r\ndown with a design to be short, yet my letter insensibly slides into\r\nlength, and swells perhaps into an enormous size. I know not how it\r\nhappens, but on such occasions I have a knack of throwing myself out\r\non paper that I cannot readily get the better of. It is a sign,\r\nhowever, that I more than barely esteem the person I write to, as I\r\nhave constantly experienced that my hand but illy performs its office\r\nunless my heart concurs. I confess I cannot conceive how I got into so\r\nscribbling a vein at present. It is now past eleven o'clock at night,\r\nand besides being on horse the greater part of the day, I intend to\r\nstart early to-morrow for Philadelphia. There I shall see the races,\r\nand the play, and, what is of more value far than all, there, too, I\r\nshall see Miss -----, you know who.\r\n\r\n\"The enclosed letter to Spring I commit to your care. I should have\r\nsent it before, as I wrote it immediately after you left this place,\r\nbut I really thought you were in New-England long ere now. I know not\r\nhis address; perhaps he is at Newport, perhaps he is not. If, on\r\ninquiry, you find that the letter is wrongly directed, pray give it an\r\nenvelope, and superscribe it anew. If he is still at Newport, it\r\nwould, perhaps, more readily reach him from New-York than from any\r\npart of New-England that you maybe at. I have said that if I am\r\nmistaken in directing the within letter, you should cover it and give\r\nit the proper address. Do, dear Burr, get somebody who can write at\r\nleast a passable hand to back it, for you give your letters such a\r\nsharp, slender, and lady-like cast, that almost every one, on seeing\r\nthem, would conclude there was a correspondence kept up between my\r\nhonest friend Spring and some of the female tribe, which might,\r\nperhaps, affect him extremely in point of reputation, as many people\r\nsuppose that nothing of this kind can be carried on between unmarried\r\npersons of the two sexes without being tinged with love; and the\r\nrather so, since the notion of Platonic love is, at the present day,\r\npretty generally, and I believe justly too, exploded. Platonic love is\r\narrant nonsense, and rarely, if ever, takes place until the parties\r\nhave at least passed their grand climacteric. Besides, the New-England\r\npeople, I am told, are odd, inquisitive kind of beings, and, when\r\npricked on by foolish curiosity, may perhaps open the letter, which I\r\ndo not choose should be common to every eye.\r\n\r\n\"You gave me some hopes that you would see my good friend Reeve before\r\nyou returned. If you do, make him my respectful compliments, and tell\r\nhim that I fully designed to write him, but that business prevented,\r\nthat laziness hindered, that--in short, tell him any thing, so it does\r\nnot impeach my affection, or lead him to think I have entirely\r\nforgotten him. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Dear Burr yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"WM. PATERSON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Dr. Spring, dated October 5, 1772, speaking of the\r\ncommencement, Judge Paterson says:--\"The young gentlemen went through\r\ntheir exercises in a manner passable enough. The speakers were all\r\ntolerable--none of them very bad nor very good. Our young friend Burr\r\nmade a graceful appearance; he was excelled by none, except perhaps by\r\nBradford. Linn, too, was pretty generally approved; but, for my part,\r\nI could not forbear thinking that he took rant, and rage, and madness\r\nfor true spirit--a very common mistake.\"\r\n\r\nFor some months after Burr graduated (1772), he remained in college,\r\nreviewing his past studies, and devoting his time to general\r\nliterature. Possessed of an ample income, having access to the college\r\nlibrary, and continuing, from time to time, as his correspondence\r\nshows, to supply himself with scientific and literary productions, his\r\nmind was greatly improved during this period. It is true he continued\r\nto indulge in amusements and pleasures; but, sleeping little, seldom\r\nmore than six hours, he found ample time for study.\r\n\r\nIn the college there was a literary club, consisting of the graduates\r\nand professors, and still known as _The Clio-Sophic Society_. Dr.\r\nSamuel S. Smith, subsequently president of the college, was then\r\n(1773) a professor. With him young Burr was no favourite, and their\r\ndislike was mutual. The attendance of the professors was expected to\r\nbe regular. The members of the society in rotation presided over its\r\ndeliberations. On a particular occasion it was the duty of young Burr\r\nto take the chair. At the hour of meeting he took his seat as\r\npresident. Dr. Smith had not then arrived; but, shortly after the\r\nbusiness commenced, he entered. Burr, leaning on one arm of the chair\r\n(for, although now sixteen years of age, he was too small to reach\r\nboth arms at the same time), began lecturing Professor Smith for his\r\nnon-attendance at an earlier hour, remarking that a different example\r\nto younger members was expected from him, and expressing a hope that\r\nit might not again be necessary to recur to the subject. Having\r\nfinished his lecture, to the great amusement of the society, he\r\nrequested the professor to resume his seat. The incident, as may well\r\nbe imagined, long served as a college joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM TIMOTHY DWIGHT.\r\n\r\nNew-Haven, March, 1772.\r\n\r\nDEAR AARON,\r\n\r\nBy a poor candle, with poor eyes and a poorer brain, I sit down to\r\nintroduce a long wished-for correspondence. You see how solicitous I\r\nam to preserve old connexions; or, rather, to begin new ones.\r\nRelationship, by the fashionable notions of those large towns, which\r\nusurp a right to lead and govern our opinions, is dwindled to a formal\r\nnothing--a mere shell of ceremony. Our ancestors, whose honesty and\r\nsimplicity (though different from the wise refinements of modern\r\npoliteness) were perhaps as deserving of imitation as the insincere\r\ncoldness of the present generation, _cousin'd_ it to the tenth degree\r\nof kindred. Though this was extending the matter to a pitch of\r\nextravagance, yet it was certainly founded upon a natural, rational\r\nprinciple. Who are so naturally our friends as those who are born\r\nsuch? I defy a New-Yorker, though callous'd over with city politeness,\r\nto be otherwise than pleased with a view of ancient hospitality to\r\nrelations, when exercised by a person of good-breeding and a genteel\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nNow, say you, what has this to do with the introduction of a\r\ncorrespondence? You shall know directly, sir. The _Edwardses_ have\r\nbeen always remarkable for this fondness for their relations. If you\r\nhave the least inclination to prove yourself a true descendant of that\r\nrespectable stock, you cannot fail of answering me very soon. This\r\n(were I disposed) I could demonstrate by algebra and syllogisms in a\r\ntwinkling; but hope you will believe me without either. I never asked\r\nfor many connexions in this way; and was never neglected but once, and\r\nthat by a Jersey gentleman, to whom I wrote and received no answer. I\r\nhope the disease is not epidemical, and that you have not determined\r\nagainst any communication with the rest of the world. It was a\r\nmortification, I confess; for I am too proud to be denied a request,\r\nthough unreasonable, as many of mine are--therefore, I insist upon an\r\nanswer, at least, and as many more as you can find in your heart to\r\ngive me; promising, in return, as many by tale, though without a large\r\nprofit. I shall not warrant their quality.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY DWIGHT, JUNR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SAMUEL SPRING.\r\n\r\nNewport, May 15th, 1772.\r\n\r\nDEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nIt is a little strange to me that I have not heard any thing of you\r\nsince your examination. I don't know but you are dissatisfied, since\r\nyou are so backward to write; however, I will, if possible, keep such\r\nthoughts out of my mind till I hear from you in particular. If you are\r\nlet down a peg lower, you may tell me of it. If you are permitted to\r\nlive in college, you may tell me of it; and if you are turned out, you\r\nmay tell me of it. If you passed examination, and have a syllogism to\r\nspeak at commencement, _if you are able to make it_, I suppose you may\r\ntell me of that likewise; or, if you are first in the class, you may\r\ntell me, if you will only do it softly; indeed, you may tell me any\r\nthing, for I profess to be your friend. Therefore, since you can trust\r\nme so far, I expect you will now write, and let me know a little how\r\nmatters are at present in college. In particular, let me know the\r\nstate of the society (Cliosophic); and if I owe any thing to it, do\r\nyou pay it, _and charge it to your humble servant_.\r\n\r\nI hope you will write the first opportunity, as I trust you have got\r\nsome very good news to tell me concerning the college in general, and\r\nyourself in particular. I have nothing particular to write. It is very\r\npleasant to me where I am at present.\r\n\r\nThe study of divinity is agreeable;--far more so than any other study\r\nwhatever would be to me. I hope to see the time when you will feel it\r\nto be your duty to go into the same study with a desire for the\r\nministry. Remember, that was the prayer of your dear father and\r\nmother, and is the prayer of your friends to this time--that you\r\nshould step forth into his place, and make it manifest that you are a\r\nfriend to Heaven, and that you have a taste for its glory. But this,\r\nyou are sensible, can never be the case if you remain in a state of\r\nnature. Therefore, improve the present and future moments to the best\r\nof purposes, as knowing the time will soon be upon you when you will\r\nwish that in living you had lived right, and acted rationally and like\r\nan immortal.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1806-7 great excitement was produced, in consequence of Colonel\r\nBurr writing in cipher to General Wilkinson, In this particular he\r\nseems to have had peculiar notions. However innocent his\r\ncorrespondence, he was, apparently, desirous at all times of casting\r\naround it a veil of mystery. The same trait was conspicuous in his\r\npolitical movements and intercourse. This has been one of the weak\r\npoints in Colonel Burr's character. He was considered a mysterious\r\nman; and what was not understood by the vulgar, was pronounced selfish\r\nor ambitious intrigue. Even his best friends were, often dissatisfied\r\nwith him on this account. Acting upon this principle of mystery at\r\nevery period of his life, he has corresponded with one or more\r\nindividuals in cipher. While yet a student in college, the letters\r\nbetween his sister and himself are frequently written in cipher. So,\r\nalso, much of his correspondence with his most intimate friend,\r\nMatthias Ogden, and with others in 1774 and 1775, is in cipher. Many\r\nof these letters, thus written, are now in existence. To those,\r\ntherefore, acquainted with the character and peculiarities of Colonel\r\nBurr, the fact of his writing a letter in cipher would not be\r\nconsidered as any thing extraordinary; because it was a habit which he\r\nhad adopted and pursued for more than thirty years preceding the\r\nperiod when this excitement was thus produced.\r\n\r\nBefore Burr left Princeton, and while lie was indulging himself in\r\npleasures and amusements, he accidentally visited a billiard-table. He\r\nengaged in play, and, although he had never before seen the game, he\r\nwas successful, and won about half a Joe. On returning home with his\r\ngains, he reflected on the incident with great mortification, and\r\ndetermined never again to play; which determination he adhered to\r\nthrough life. Colonel Burr not only abstained from playing at\r\nbilliards, but with equal pertinacity he refused to play at any game\r\nfor the purpose of acquiring money.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had been somewhat tranquillized by his conversation with\r\nDr. Witherspoon on the subject of the awakening in college in 1772,\r\nyet he was not entirely at ease. In consequence of which he came to a\r\nresolution not to enter upon the concerns of life until this point was\r\nmore satisfactorily settled in his own mind. He concluded, therefore,\r\nto visit and consult the Rev. Joseph Bellamy, a venerable and devoted\r\nfriend of his late father, and to whom he was known by reputation.\r\n\r\nJoseph Bellamy, D.D., was an eminent preacher and theological writer\r\nof Connecticut, and intimate friend of Colonel Burr's relative, the\r\nfamous Jonathan Edwards, with whose particular opinion he fully\r\nagreed. He was celebrated in his days, before the establishment of\r\ntheological seminaries, as an instructor of young men preparing for\r\nthe ministry. The late Governor Wolcott used to speak of him with the\r\nhighest respect for his talent and moderation. He died in 1790.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1773, Burr visited him at Bethlehem, in Connecticut,\r\nand was received by his aged friend in a most kind and affectionate\r\nmanner. His advice, and the use of his library, were promptly\r\ntendered. Burr commenced a course of reading on religious topics, and\r\nwas thus occupied from sixteen to eighteen hours a day. His habits\r\nwere those of great abstinence, and a recluse. His conversations with\r\nthe reverend divine were encouraged and indulged in with freedom, and\r\nhis inquiries answered. Here he remained until the spring of 1774,\r\nwhen, to use his own language, he \"came to the conclusion that the\r\nroad to Heaven was open to all alike.\" He, however, from that time\r\nforward, avoided most studiously all disputation on the subject of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nAn impression has been created that Côlonel Burr was placed by his\r\nguardian under Dr. Bellamy, for the purpose of studying divinity. This\r\nis an error. His visit to the Rev. Dr. was not the result of a\r\nconference or communication with any person whatever; but the volition\r\nof his own mind, and for the purpose already stated. In fact, after\r\nBurr entered college, his studies and his future pursuits in life\r\nappear to have been left entirely under his own control. Whether this\r\narose from indolence on the part of his guardian, or from pertinacity\r\nin young Burr, is uncertain; perhaps a little of both, united with the\r\ngreat confidence which his uncle reposed in his judgment and talents.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1774, while he yet resided at Dr. Bellamy's, he\r\ncontemplated studying law; but was undecided whether he should read\r\nwith Pierpont Edwards, or with his brother-in-law, Tappan Reeve, and\r\nupon this subject he wrote his guardian, who replies, in a letter\r\ndated\r\n\r\n\"Stockbridge, February 11th, 1774.\r\n\r\n\"Whether you study law with Mr. Reeve or your uncle Pierpont is a\r\nmatter of indifference with me. I would have you act your pleasure\r\ntherein. I shall write to your uncle upon it, but yet treat it as a\r\nmatter of doubt. Your board I shall settle with Dr. Bellamy myself. I\r\nwill send you cash to pay for your horse very soon. You may expect it\r\nin the forepart of March. If I had known of this want of yours sooner,\r\nI would have paid it before this.\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate uncle,\r\n\r\n\"TIMOTHY EDWARDS\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1774, he left the Rev. Mr. Bellamy's, and went to the house of\r\nhis brother-in-law, Tappan Reeve, where his time was occupied in\r\nreading, principally history; but especially those portions of it\r\nwhich related to wars, and battles, and sieges, which tended to\r\ninflame his natural military ardour. The absorbing topics of taxation\r\nand the rights of the people were agitating the then British colonies\r\nfrom one extreme to the other. These subjects, therefore, could not\r\npass unnoticed by a youth of the inquiring mind and ardent feelings of\r\nBurr. Constitutional law, and the relative rights of the crown and the\r\ncolonists, were examined with all the acumen which he possessed, and\r\nhe became a Whig from reflection and conviction, as well as from\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nAt this period, Burr's most intimate and confidential correspondent\r\nwas Matthias Ogden, of New-Jersey, subsequently Colonel Ogden, a\r\ngallant and distinguished revolutionary officer. He writes to Burr,\r\ndated\r\n\r\n\"Elizabethtown, August 9th, 1774.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR AARON,\r\n\r\n\"I received yours by Mr. Beach, dated Sunday. I am not a little\r\npleased that you have the doctor (Bellamy) so completely under your\r\nthumb. Last Saturday I went a crabbing. Being in want of a thole-pin,\r\nI substituted a large jackknife in its stead, with the blade open and\r\nsticking up. It answered the purpose of rowing very well; but it seems\r\nthat was not the only purpose it had to answer; for, after we had been\r\nsome time on the flats, running on the mud, as the devil would have\r\nit, in getting into the boat I threw my leg directly across the edge\r\nof the knife, which left a decent mark of nearly four inches long, and\r\nmore than one inch deep. It was then up anchor and away. Our first\r\nport was Dayton's ferry, where Dr. Bennet happened to be, but without\r\nhis apparatus for sewing, to the no small disadvantage of me, who was\r\nto undergo the operation. Mrs. Dayton, however, furnished him with a\r\nlarge darning-needle, which, as soon as I felt going through my skin,\r\nI thought was more like a gimlet boring into me; but, with the help of\r\na glass of wine, I grinned and bore it, until he took a few stitches\r\nin the wound. So much for crabbing.\r\n\r\n\"I was at New-York about a fortnight since, on my way to Jamaica, Long\r\nIsland. The object of this journey you understand. I stayed at Mr.\r\nWillett's three days, and then went to Colonel Morris's, and spent two\r\ndays there very agreeably. Nothing occurred worth relating, unless it\r\nbe some transactions of the greatest fool I ever knew.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Elliot, collector of New-York, Mr. and Mrs. Delancey and\r\ndaughter, dined there on Sunday. Witherspoon [1] was led in with a\r\nlarge bag tied to his hair, that reached down to the waistband of his\r\nbreeches, and a brass locket hanging from his neck below his stomach.\r\nHe was turned round and round by each of the company: was asked where\r\nhe got that very neat bag, and the valuable locket? He readily\r\nanswered, they were a present from Lady Kitty, who was violently in\r\nlove with him, and he expected to marry her in a short time. He is so\r\ncredulous that any child might impose on him. I told him that I came\r\nfrom Lord Stirling's, and that he might write by me to Lady Kitty.\r\nAccordingly, he wrote a long letter and gave me, which I opened there,\r\nand, by desire of Colonel Morris, answered it, when I got to New-York,\r\nin Lady Kitty's name, informing him that he must tell Mr. Morris to\r\nprovide himself with another tutor, as she intended marrying him\r\nwithout fail the first of September, which I suppose he will as\r\nsincerely believe as he does his existence.\r\n\r\n\"Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\"MATT. OGDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MATTHIAS OGDEN.\r\n\r\nLitchfield, August 17th, 1774.\r\n\r\nDEAR MATT.,\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed any further, let me tell you that, a few days ago, a\r\nmob of several hundred persons gathered at Barrington, and tore down\r\nthe house of a man who was suspected of being unfriendly to the\r\nliberties of the people; broke up the court, then sitting at that\r\nplace, &c. As many of the rioters belonged to this colony, and the\r\nSuperior Court was then sitting at this place, the sheriff was\r\nimmediately despatched to apprehend the ringleaders. He returned\r\nyesterday with eight prisoners, who were taken _without resistance_.\r\nBut this minute there is entering the town on horseback, with great\r\nregularity, about fifty men, armed each with a white club; and I\r\nobserve others continually dropping in. I shall here leave a blank, to\r\ngive you (perhaps in heroics) a few sketches of my unexampled valour,\r\nshould they proceed to hostilities; and, should they not, I can then\r\ntell you what I would have done.\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned _sneaks all gave bonds for their appearance_, to\r\nstand a trial at the next court for committing a riot.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of September, 1774, he again writes Ogden:--\r\n\r\nI wrote you last Thursday, and enclosed one of the songs you desired,\r\nwhich was all I could then obtain. Miss -----, the fountain of melody,\r\nfurnished me with it. I knew that she, and no one else, had the notes\r\nof the enclosed song. I told her I should be glad to copy them for a\r\nmost accomplished young gentleman in the Jerseys. She engaged to bring\r\nthem the first time she came in town, for she lives about two miles\r\nfrom here. I this day received it, precisely as you have it. You may\r\ndepend upon its being the work of her own hands. If this don't deserve\r\nan acrostic, I don't know--sense, beauty, modesty, and music. Matter\r\nplenty.\r\n\r\nPray tell me whether your prayers are heard, and a good old saint,\r\nthough a little in your way, is yet in Heaven. But remember, Matt.,\r\nyou can never be without plague, and when one gets out of the way, a\r\nworse, very often, supplies its place; so, I tell you again, be\r\ncontent, and hope for better times.\r\n\r\nI am determined never to have any dealings with your friend Cupid\r\nuntil I know certainly how matters will turn out with you: for should\r\nsome lucky devil step in between my friend and----, which kind Heaven\r\ngrant may never be; in such a case, I say, I would choose to be\r\nuntied, and then, you know, the wide world is before us.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBurr again writes him, dated\r\n\r\nLitchfield, February 2d, 1775.\r\n\r\nI sent you a packet by N. Hazard, and from that time to this I have\r\nnot had the most distant prospect of conveying a letter to you.\r\nHowever, I have written a number of scrawls, the substance of which\r\nyou shall now have.\r\n\r\nThe times with me are pretty much as usual; not so full of action as I\r\ncould wish; and I find this propensity to action is very apt to lead\r\nme into scrapes. T. B. has been here since I wrote you last; he came\r\nvery unexpectedly. You will conclude we had some confab about Miss\r\n-----. We had but little private chat, and the whole of that little\r\nwas about her. He would now and then insinuate slyly what a clever\r\ncircumstance it would be to have such a wife, with her fortune.\r\n\r\nT. BURR, [2] by his kindness to me, has certainly laid me under\r\nobligations, which it would be the height of ingratitude in me ever to\r\nforget; but I cannot conceive it my duty to be in the least influenced\r\nby these in the present case. Were I to conform to his inclination, it\r\ncould give him pleasure or pain only as the consequence was good or\r\nbad to me. The sequel might be such as would inevitably cause him the\r\nmost bitter anguish; and, in all probability, would be such if I\r\nshould consult his fancy instead of my judgment. And who can be a\r\njudge of these consequences but myself? But even supposing things\r\ncould be so situated that, by gratifying him, I should certainly be\r\nthe means of his enjoying some permanent satisfaction, and should\r\nsubject myself to a bare probability of misery as permanent, would it\r\nnot stagger the most generous soul to think of sacrificing a whole\r\nlife's comfort to the caprice of a friend? But this is a case that can\r\nnever happen, unless that friend has some mean and selfish motive,\r\nsuch as I know T. Burr has not. I can never believe that too great\r\ndeference to the judgment of another, in these matters, can arise from\r\nany greatness of soul. It appears to me the genuine offspring of\r\nmeanness. I suppose you are impatient for my reply to these\r\nimportunities. I found my tongue and fancy too cramped to say much.\r\nHowever, I rallied my thoughts and set forth, as well as I was able,\r\nthe inconveniences and uncertainty attending such an affair. I am\r\ndetermined to be very blunt the next time the matter is urged.\r\n\r\nI have now and then an affair of petty gallantry, which might\r\nentertain you if you were acquainted with the different characters I\r\nhave to deal with; but, without that, they would be very insipid.\r\n\r\nI have lately engaged in a correspondence of a peculiar nature. I\r\nwrite once, and sometimes twice a week, to a lady who knows not that\r\nshe ever received a line from me. The letters, on both sides, are\r\nmostly sentimental. Those of the lady are doubtless written with more\r\nsincerity, and less reserve, than if she knew I had any concern with\r\nthem. Mr. ----- received a letter from Miss -----. He is very little\r\nversed in letter-writing, and engaged, or rather permitted, me to\r\nanswer it, not thinking thereby to embark in a regular correspondence,\r\nbut supposing the matter would thus end. I have had many scruples of\r\nconscience about this affair, though I really entered into it not with\r\nany sinister view, but purely to oblige----. I should be glad to know\r\nyour opinion of it. You will readily observe the advantage I have over\r\n-----. He is of an unsuspicious make, and this gives me an opportunity\r\n(if I had any inclination) to insert things which might draw from her\r\nsecrets she would choose I should be ignorant of. But I would suffer\r\ncrucifixion rather than be guilty of such an unparalleled meanness. On\r\nthe contrary, I have carefully avoided saying any thing which might\r\nhave the least tendency to make her write what she would be unwilling\r\nI should see.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, 1775, Burr writes Ogden:--\r\n\r\nI have received your and Aaron's [3] letters. I was a little\r\ndisappointed that you did not send an acrostic; but I still entertain\r\nsome secret hope that the muse (who, you say, has taken her flight)\r\nwill shortly return, and, by a new and stricter intimacy, more than\r\nrepay the pains of this momentary absence. Your happiness, Matt., is\r\nreally almost the only present thing I can contemplate with any\r\nsatisfaction; though I, like other fools, view futurity with\r\npartiality enough to make it very desirable; but I must first throw\r\nreason aside, and leave fancy uncontrolled. In some of these happy\r\nfreaks I have endeavoured to take as agreeable a sleigh-ride as you\r\nhad to Goshen; but I find it impracticable, unless you will make one\r\nof the party; for my imagination, when most romantic, is not lively or\r\ndelusive enough to paint an object that can, in my eyes, atone for\r\nyour absence. From this you will conclude that the news you heard of\r\nme at Princeton is groundless. It is so far from being true, that\r\nscarce two persons can fix on the same lady to tease me with. However,\r\nI would not have you think that this diversity of opinion arises from\r\nthe volatility of my constitution, or that I am in love with every new\r\nor pretty face I see. But, I hope, you know me too well to need a\r\ncaution of this nature. I am very glad to hear of -----'s downfall.\r\nBut, with all that fellow's low-lived actions, I don't more sincerely\r\ndespise him than I do certain other narrow-hearted scoundrels you have\r\namong you. Mean as he is, he appears to me to have (or rather to have\r\nhad) more of something at bottom that bordered on honour, than some\r\nwho will pass through life respected by many. I say this, not so much\r\nto raise him above the common standard of d--ls, as to sink them below\r\nit. My idea of a d--l is composed more of malice than of meanness.\r\n\r\nSince I commenced this letter I have passed through a scene entirely\r\nnew. Now, as novelty is the chief and almost only ingredient of\r\nhappiness here below, you'll fancy I have had some lucky turn. I think\r\nit quite the reverse, I assure you. I have serious thoughts of leaving\r\nthe matter here, that you may be on the rack of curiosity for a month\r\nor so. Would not this be truly satanic? What would be your conjectures\r\nin such a case? The first, I _guess_, that I was sadly in love, and\r\nhad met with some mortifying rebuff.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say if I should tell you that ----- had absolutely\r\nprofessed love for me? Now I can see you with both hands up--eyes and\r\nmouth wide open; but don't be over scrupulous. Trust me, I tell you\r\nthe whole truth. I cannot at present give you any further particulars\r\nabout the matter, than that I felt foolish enough, and gave as\r\ncautious a turn to it as I could, for which I am destined to suffer\r\nher future hostility.\r\n\r\nLast week I received a letter from T. Edwards, which I fear may prove\r\nfatal to the dear project of the 15th of April. He intends to be\r\nhereabout the middle of that month. Supposing he should come here the\r\n13th of April, what could I do? Run off and leave him? Observe the\r\nuncertainty of all sublunary things. I, who a few months ago was as\r\nuncontrolled in my motions as the lawless meteors, am now (sad\r\nreverse!) at the beck of a person forty miles off. But all this\r\nlamentation, if well considered, is entirely groundless, for (_between\r\nyou and me_) I intend to see you at Elizabethtown this spring. But\r\neven supposing I should fail in this--where is this sad reverse of\r\nfortune?--this lamentable change? Is it not a very easy matter to fix\r\non another time, and write you word by T. Edwards?\r\n\r\nI have struck up a correspondence with J. Bellamy (son to the famous\r\ndivine of that name). He has very lately settled in the practice of\r\nthe law at Norwich, a place about seventy miles S. E. of this. He is\r\none of the cleverest fellows I have to deal with. Sensible, a person\r\nof real humour, and is an excellent judge of mankind, though he has\r\nnot had opportunity of seeing much of the world. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JONATHAN BELLAMY\r\n\r\nNorwich, March 14th, 1775.\r\n\r\nTo do justice to circumstances, which you know are of the greatest\r\nimportance in order to form a true estimate of what a person either\r\nsays or does, it is indispensably necessary for me to tell you that it\r\nnot only rains very generously, but that it is as dark as it was\r\nbefore light was created. It would be ridiculous to suppose that you\r\nneed information that nothing but the irresistible desire of writing\r\ncould possibly keep me at home this evening.\r\n\r\nI had received your February favour only just time to laugh at it\r\nonce, when the melancholy news that Betsy Devotion, of Windham, was\r\nvery dangerously sick, banished every joyous thought from my heart.\r\nThis Betsy you may remember to have heard mentioned near the name of\r\nNatty Huntington, who died last December; and a very angel she was\r\ntoo, I assure you. You see I speak of her in the _past_ sense, for she\r\nhas left us; and her friends are sure she is not less an angel _now_\r\nthan she was ten days ago. Very certain I am, that if a natural\r\nsweetness of disposition can scale Heaven's walls, she went over like\r\na bird. But I believe we must leave _her_ and all the rest of our\r\ndeparted friends to be sentenced by a higher Board.\r\n\r\n  \"Transports last not in the human heart;\r\n  But all with transports soon agree to part.\"\r\n\r\nIf nature, in spite of us, did not take care of herself, we could not\r\nbut be perfectly wretched. Philosophy is the emptiest word in the\r\ndictionary. And you may observe, wherever you find them, that those\r\npersons who profess to place all their reliance upon it, under every\r\naffecting circumstance of life, do but make use of the term as a mask\r\nfor an iron heart. \"But\" (as the devil said on another occasion) \"put\r\nforth thine hand, and touch his bone, and his flesh, and he will curse\r\nthee to thy face.\" They have as little fortitude as anybody when\r\nsufferings pinch home upon them.\r\n\r\nThus have I relieved a heart that perhaps felt a little too full; and\r\nif it is at the expense of my _head_, I have nevertheless the\r\nconsolation that it will be received only as the overflowings of my\r\npresent feelings.\r\n\r\n\"When and where shall I see you again?\" somebody once asked me. The\r\nLord only knows. Perhaps at the election at Hartford. If we can meet\r\n_there_--there will be time for notice. But, happen as it may, be\r\nassured that I am your most sincere friend,\r\n\r\nJONATHAN BELLAMY.\r\n\r\n\"Stick my compliments in for him,\" says Hannah Phelps, a jolly girl of\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MATTHIAS OGDEN.\r\n\r\nElizabethtown, March 18th, 1775.\r\n\r\nSince we last saw each other, the 15th of April has been my mark, but\r\nthe receipt of yours of the 12th has blotted it from my memory, for\r\nwhich nothing could atone but the expectation of seeing you here\r\nnearly as soon.\r\n\r\nI read with pleasure your love intrigues; your anonymous\r\ncorrespondence with Miss -----, &.c., and, with as much seriousness,\r\nthe part relative to ----, Thaddeus Burr's overtures, &c.\r\n\r\n_Steadily_, Aaron. Money is alluring, and there is a pleasure in\r\ngratifying a friend; but let not a fortune buy your peace, nor sell\r\nyour happiness. Neither be too much biased by a friend, or any one's\r\nadvice, in a matter of so great consequence to yourself. Perhaps she\r\nis worthy your love, and, if I could think she was, I would not say a\r\nsingle thing to discourage you. Be cautious, Aaron; weigh the matter\r\nwell. Should your generous heart be sold for naught, it would greatly\r\nhurt the peace of mine. Let not her sense, her education, her modesty,\r\nher graceful actions, or her wit, betray you. Has she a soul framed\r\nfor love? For friendship? But why need I advise a person of better\r\njudgment than myself? It is not advice, my friend; it is only caution.\r\nYou have a difficult part to act. If you reject, she curses: if you\r\npity, she takes it for encouragement. Matters with me go on smoothly.\r\n\r\nI am now making up a party to go to the Falls, to be ready against you\r\ncome. My best regards to Mr. and Mrs. Reeve. I remain happy in the\r\nenjoyment of -----'s love, and am,\r\n\r\nYour unfeigned friend,\r\n\r\nMATT. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the decease of President Burr, Lyman Hall was intrusted by the\r\nexecutors with the collection of sundry debts due to the estate. A\r\nremoval, and his various avocations, prevented his performing that\r\nduty with the necessary promptitude. In consequence, the heirs were\r\nexposed to loss. A friend of the family, the Rev. James Caldwell, of\r\nNew-Jersey, wrote him on the subject, and his answer is so honourable,\r\nthat it is deemed only an act of justice to an upright man to record\r\nit here. It is another instance of the integrity in private life of\r\nthose patriots that planned and accomplished the American Revolution.\r\nIt will be seen that Mr. Hall was a member of the Congress of 1775\r\nfrom the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 17th May, 1775.\r\n\r\nREV. SIR,\r\n\r\nSince I saw you, and afterwards Mr. Ogden, in Georgia, I have written\r\nto my attorneys and correspondents in Connecticut, to give me all the\r\ninformation they could obtain respecting the affairs and concerns of\r\nthe late President Burr, left in my hands; which I had delivered over,\r\nbefore I left that colony in 1759, into the hands of Thaddeus Burr, of\r\nFairfield; but no satisfactory answer can as yet be obtained. One\r\ndebt, indeed, has been discovered, of about forty pounds New-York\r\ncurrency; but the bond on which it is due is as yet concealed.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I find that it is not in my power to redeliver those\r\nsecurities for moneys which I was once in possession of; nor have I\r\nreceived the moneys due on those which were good; but am determined\r\nthat I will make just satisfaction to the claimant heirs (orphans) of\r\nthe late President Burr. It is, I know, my indispensable duty, and I\r\nhave for that purpose brought a quantity of rice to this city, the\r\navails of which, when sold, shall be appropriated to that use. I\r\nshould be glad that you, or Mr. Ogden, the executor, could be here to\r\ntransact the business, and, on a settlement, give me a power of\r\nattorney, properly authenticated, to recover any part of those moneys\r\nI can find due when I shall arrive in Connecticut, to which I propose\r\ngoing as soon as the Congress rises. As I am in Congress, I cannot see\r\nyou directly; but, if liberty can be obtained, shall wait on you or\r\nMr. Ogden, or both, in my way to New-York, in a few days; but I think\r\nMr. Ogden, the executor, if it will suit, had better come here and\r\nsettle it. I mention him because I suppose he is the proper person to\r\ndischarge me, and give me a power of attorney.\r\n\r\nI am, reverend sir,\r\n\r\nWith esteem, yours,\r\n\r\nLYMAN HALL.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. JAS. CALDWELL, _Elizabethtown_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. A relative of President Witherspoon.\r\n\r\n2. Uncle to Colonel Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\n3. Subsequently Governor Ogden, of New Jersey, and brother of Matthias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his retirement at the house of his brother-in-law (Judge Reeve),\r\nBurr was aroused by the shedding of his countrymen's blood at\r\nLexington on the 19th of April, 1775. Immediately after that battle,\r\nhe wrote a letter to his friend Ogden, requesting him to come on to\r\nLitchfield and arrange for joining the standard of their country.\r\nOgden wrote for answer that he could not make the necessary\r\narrangements. The battle of Bunker's Hill (on the 16th of June, 1775)\r\nfollowed in rapid succession; whereupon he started for Elizabethtown,\r\nNew-Jersey, to meet Ogden, and aid him in preparations for the journey\r\nto Cambridge, where the American army was encamped.\r\n\r\nBurr had been reading those portions of history which detailed the\r\nachievements of the greatest military men and tacticians of the age in\r\nwhich they lived. His idea of discipline and subordination was formed\r\naccordingly. With the most enthusiastic feelings, and under the\r\ninfluence of such opinions, Burr, in company with his friend Matthias\r\nOgden, left Elizabethtown, in July, 1775, for Cambridge, with the\r\nintention of tendering their services in defence of American liberty.\r\nHe had now entered his twentieth year, but, in appearance, was a mere\r\nstripling.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that, whatever were Burr's pursuits or studies, his\r\nhabits were those of intense application. He had already imbibed a\r\nmilitary ardour equalled by few--surpassed by none. Panting for glory\r\non the battle-field, information and improvement as a soldier were now\r\nthe objects that absorbed all his thoughts. On his joining the army,\r\nhowever, he was sadly disappointed in his expectations. The whole was\r\na scene of idleness, confusion, and dissipation. From the want of\r\ncamp-police, the health of the men was impaired, and many sickened and\r\ndied. Of the officers, some were ignorant of their duty, while others\r\nwere fearful of enforcing a rigid discipline, lest it should give\r\noffence to those who were unaccustomed to restraint. Deep\r\nmortification and disappointment preyed upon the mind of young Burr.\r\n\r\nThe following original letters are found among the papers of Colonel\r\nBurr, and, as casting some light upon the history of those times, are\r\ndeemed of sufficient interest (and not inapplicable) to be inserted in\r\nthis work. The patriotic reply of General Montgomery is above all\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROGER SHERMAN TO GENERAL DAVID WOOSTER.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 23d, 1775.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe Congress, having determined it necessary to keep up an army for\r\nthe defence of America at the charge of the United Colonies, have\r\nappointed the following general officers:--George Washington, Esq.,\r\ncommander-in-chief. Major-generals Ward, Lee, Schuyler, and Putnam.\r\nBrigadier-generals Pomeroy, Montgomery, yourself, Heath, Spencer,\r\nThomas, Sullivan (of New-Hampshire), and one Green, of Rhode-Island.\r\n\r\nI am sensible that, according to your former rank, you were entitled\r\nto the place of a major-general; and as one was to be appointed in\r\nConnecticut, I heartily recommended you to the Congress. I informed\r\nthem of the arrangement made by our assembly, which I thought would be\r\nsatisfactory to have them continue in the same order. But, as General\r\nPutnam's fame was spread abroad, and especially his successful\r\nenterprise at Noddle's Island, the account of which had just arrived,\r\nit gave him a preference in the opinion of the delegates in general,\r\nso that his appointment was unanimous among the colonies; but, from\r\nyour known abilities and firm attachment to the American cause, we\r\nwere very desirous of your continuance in the army, and hope you will\r\naccept of the appointment made by the Congress.\r\n\r\nI think the pay of a brigadier is about one hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars per month. I suppose a commission is sent to you by General\r\nWashington. We received intelligence yesterday of an engagement at\r\nCharlestown, but have not had the particulars. All the Connecticut\r\ntroops are now taken into the continental army. I hope proper care\r\nwill be taken to secure the colony against any sudden invasion, which\r\nmust be at their own expense.\r\n\r\nI have nothing further that I am at liberty to acquaint you with of\r\nthe doings of the Congress but what have been made public. I would not\r\nhave any thing published in the papers that I write, lest something\r\nmay inadvertently escape me which ought not to be published. I should\r\nbe glad if you would write to me every convenient opportunity, and\r\ninform me of such occurrences, and other matters, as you may think\r\nproper and useful for me to be acquainted with. The general officers\r\nwere elected in the Congress, not by nomination, but by ballot.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem,\r\n\r\nYour humble servant,\r\n\r\nROGER SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nDAVID WOOSTER, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES DUANE, OF NEW-YORK, TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 21st, 1775.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI am directed by the Congress to acquaint you of an arrangement in the\r\nMassachusetts department, and the reason which led to it, lest, by\r\nmisunderstanding it, you might think yourself neglected.\r\n\r\nWhen brigadiers-general were to be appointed, it was agreed that the\r\nfirst in nomination should be one of the Massachusetts generals. The\r\ngentlemen from that province recommended General Pomeroy, who was\r\naccordingly fixed upon; but, before his commission arrived at the\r\ncamp, he had retired from the army. Under these circumstances the\r\nCongress thought it just to fill up the commission designed for Mr.\r\nPomeroy with the name of General Thomas as first brigadier. You,\r\nconsequently, hold the rank to which you were elected.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope this may not give you any displeasure, as I am\r\nconfident no disrespect was intended.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to accept my sincere wishes for your honour and happiness,\r\nand particularly in the discharge of the important trust which you\r\nhave undertaken.\r\n\r\nI am, with regard,\r\n\r\nDear sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS. DUANE.\r\n\r\nGeneral MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MONTGOMERY'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been honoured with your letter of the 21st inst. My\r\nacknowledgments are due for the attention shown me by the Congress.\r\n\r\nI submit, with great cheerfullness, to any regulation they, in their\r\nprudence, shall judge expedient. Laying aside the punctilio of the\r\n_soldier_, I shall endeavour to discharge my duty to society,\r\nconsidering myself only as the _citizen_, reduced to the melancholy\r\nnecessity of taking up arms for the public safety.\r\n\r\nI am, &c., R. M.\r\n\r\nAnswer.\r\n\r\nThe preceding is endorsed, in the handwriting of General Montgomery,\r\non the back of Mr. Duane's letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laxity of the discipline which pervaded the camp at Cambridge, the\r\ninexperience of the officers, and the contests and petty squabbles\r\nabout rank, all tended to excite great jealousy and discontent in the\r\narmy. As yet, Burr was attached to no particular corps. He mingled\r\nindiscriminately with conflicting factions, until, disgusted with the\r\nscene which he daily witnessed, he was violently attacked with a\r\nnervous fever, by which he was confined to his bed.\r\n\r\nOne day he heard Ogden and some young men of the army conversing, in\r\nan apartment adjoining that in which he was lying, on the subject of\r\nan expedition. He called Ogden to his bedside, and inquired what was\r\nthe nature of the expedition of which they were speaking. Ogden\r\ninformed him that Colonel Arnold, with a detachment of ten or twelve\r\nhundred men, was about to proceed through the wilderness for the\r\npurpose of attacking Quebec. Burr instantly raised himself up in the\r\nbed, and declared that he would accompany them; and, so pertinacious\r\nwas he on this point, that he immediately, although much enfeebled,\r\ncommenced dressing himself. Ogden expostulated, and spoke of his\r\ndebilitated state--referred to the hardships and privations that he\r\nmust necessarily endure on such a march, &c. But all was unavailing.\r\nYoung Burr was determined, and was immoveable. He forthwith selected\r\nfour or five hale, hearty fellows, to whom he proposed that they\r\nshould form a mess, and unite their destiny on the expedition through\r\nthe wilderness. To this arrangement they cheerfully acceded. His\r\nfriend Ogden, and others of his acquaintance, were conveyed in\r\ncarriages from Cambridge to Newburyport, distant about sixty miles;\r\nbut Burr, with his new associates in arms, on the 14th of September,\r\n1775, shouldered their muskets, took their knapsacks upon their backs,\r\nand marched to the place of embarcation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM J. BELLAMY.\r\n\r\nLitchfield, August 17th, 1775.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST SOLDIER,\r\n\r\nI was infinitely surprised to hear from you in the army. I can hardly\r\ntell you what sensations I did not feel at the time. Shall not attempt\r\nto describe them, though they deprived me of a night's sleep. But that\r\nwas not spent altogether unhappily. My busybody, _Fancy_, led me a\r\nmost romantic chase; in which, you may be sure, I visited your tent;\r\nbeheld you (unnoticed) musing on your present circumstances,\r\napparently agitated by every emotion which would naturally fill the\r\nheart of one who has come to the resolution to risk his life for his\r\ncountry's freedom. You will excuse my mentioning, that from a deep,\r\nabsent meditation, partly expressed by half-pronounced soliloquies, I\r\nbeheld you start up, clap your hand upon your sword, and look so\r\nfiercely, that it almost frightened me. The scene, on your discovering\r\nme, immediately changed to something more tender; but I won't waste\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nIf you should happen to find Dr. James Cogswell, who is in Colonel\r\nSpencer's regiment, please to give my best love to him, and tell him\r\nhe is a lazy scoundrel.\r\n\r\nIt rains, my boy, excessively. Does it not drop through your tent?\r\nWrite often to\r\n\r\nJONA. BELLAMY.\r\n\r\nTo A. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the guardian and relatives of young Burr heard of his\r\ndetermination to accompany Arnold in his expedition against Quebec,\r\nthey not only remonstrated, but they induced others, who were friendly\r\nto him, to adopt a similar course. While he remained at Cambridge, he\r\nreceived numerous letters on the subject. The two following are\r\nselected:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DR. JAMES COGSWELL.\r\n\r\nCamp in Roxbury, 9th September, 1775.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to hear that you are determined on the new\r\nexpedition to Quebec. I am sorry on my own account, as I promised\r\nmyself much satisfaction and pleasure in your company: but I am not\r\naltogether selfish; I am right-justified sorry on yours. The\r\nexpedition in which you are engaged is a very arduous one; and those\r\nwho are engaged in it must unavoidably undergo great hardships. Your\r\nconstitution (if I am not much mistaken) is very delicate, and not\r\nformed for the fatigues of the camp. The expedition, I am sensible, is\r\na glorious one, and nothing but a persuasion of my inability to endure\r\nthe hardships of it would have deterred me from engaging in it. If\r\nthis excuse was sufficient for me, I am persuaded it is for you, and\r\nought to influence you to abandon all thoughts of undertaking it. I\r\nhave no friend so dear to me (and I love my friends) but that I am\r\nwilling to sacrifice for the good of the grand--the important cause,\r\nin which we are engaged; but, to think of a friend's sacrificing\r\nhimself, without any valuable end being answered by it, is painful\r\nbeyond expression. _You will die; I know you will die in the\r\nundertaking; it is impossible for you to endure the fatigue._ I am so\r\nexercised about your going, that I should come and see you if I had\r\nnot got the Scriptural excuse,--a wife, and cannot come.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, you must not go: I cannot bear the thoughts of it.\r\n'Tis little less melancholy than following you to your grave.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nJAMES COGSWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PETER COLT.\r\n\r\nWatertown, 11th September, 1775.\r\n\r\nI cannot retire to rest till I have written you a few lines, to excuse\r\nmy casting so many discouragements in the way of your journey to\r\nQuebec. At first I did not think it so hazardous; but, upon inquiring\r\nof those who had more knowledge of the country, thought it too\r\nfatiguing an undertaking for one of your years; and I find it\r\naltogether against the sentiments of your friends. I think you might\r\nbe fairly excused, without the risk of being reported as timid, as the\r\nhopes of your family depend in a great degree upon you. I should have\r\nrejoiced to see you relinquish this expedition; but, as you are\r\ndetermined to pursue it, must beg you not to let any thing we have\r\nsaid to you depress your spirits, or damp your resolution, as it may\r\notherwise have a fatal effect. We have held up the dark side of the\r\npicture, in order to deter you from going. You must now think only on\r\nthe bright side, and make the least of every disagreeable circumstance\r\nattending your march. Let no difficulty discourage you. The enterprise\r\nis glorious, and, if it succeeds, will redound to the honour of those\r\nwho have planned and executed it.\r\n\r\nMay God give you health and strength equal to the fatigue of the\r\nmarch, and preserve you safe from every danger you may encounter. Make\r\nQuebec a safe retreat to the forces. I hope to have a particular\r\ndescription of Canada from you when you return.\r\n\r\nDon't turn Catholic for the sake of the girls. Again I beg you to\r\nforget what I have said to discourage you. It proceeded from love to\r\nyou, and not a desire of rendering you ridiculous. Adieu, my dear\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nPETER COLT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two after Burr's arrival at Newburyport, he was called upon\r\nby a messenger from his guardian, Timothy Edwards, with instructions\r\nto bring the young fugitive back. A letter from his uncle (T. Edwards)\r\nwas delivered to him at the same time. Having read the letter, and\r\nheard the messenger's communication, he coolly addressed him, and\r\nasked, \"How do you expect to take me back, if I should refuse to go?\r\nIf you were to make any forcible attempt upon me, I would have you\r\nhung up in ten minutes.\" After a short pause the messenger presented a\r\nsecond letter from his guardian, and with it a small remittance in\r\ngold. It was couched in the most affectionate and tender language,\r\nimportuning him to return; and depicting, in the darkest colours, the\r\nsufferings he must endure if he survived the attempt to reach Quebec.\r\nIt affected young Burr very sensibly, insomuch that he shed tears. But\r\nhis destiny was fixed. He wrote, however, a respectful letter to his\r\nuncle, explanatory of his reasons for accompanying the army, and\r\nexpressive of his gratitude for the kindness he had experienced.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 20th of September, 1775, the troops under the command\r\nof Arnold embarked at Newburyport. This detachment was to penetrate\r\nCanada about ninety or one hundred miles below Montreal, proceeding by\r\nthe Kennebec river, and thence through the wilderness between the St.\r\nLawrence and the settled parts of Maine. In this route, precipitous\r\nmountains, deep and almost impenetrable swamps and morasses, were to\r\nbe passed. Arnold, in a letter to General Washington, dated _Fort\r\nWeston_, September 25th, 1775, says: \"I design Chaudiere Pond as a\r\ngeneral rendezvous, and from thence proceed in a body. I believe, from\r\nthe best information I can procure, we shall be able to perform the\r\njourney in twenty days; the distance from this being about one hundred\r\nand eighty miles.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the march through the wilderness, no regard whatever was paid\r\nto order or discipline. Every man was left to take care of himself,\r\nand make the best of his way through the woods. The sufferings of this\r\ndetachment from wet, and cold, and hunger, were excessive. From the\r\nlatter, however, Burr suffered less than any of his companions. His\r\nabstemious habits in regard to eating seemed peculiarly calculated for\r\nsuch an expedition. Both Burr and Ogden had been accustomed, in small\r\nboats, to aquatic excursions round Staten Island and in its vicinity.\r\nThey were skilful helmsmen, and in this particular, in passing the\r\nrapids, were frequently useful. Notwithstanding this qualification,\r\nhowever, Burr, with some soldiers in a boat, was carried over a fall\r\nof nearly twenty feet. One man was drowned, and much of the baggage\r\nlost. The weather was cold, and it was with great difficulty that he\r\nreached the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Arnold, who, at the head of the two first divisions, still prosecuted\r\nhis march, was thirty-two days traversing a hideous wilderness,\r\nwithout seeing a house or any thing human. The troops were under the\r\nnecessity of hauling their bateaux up rapid streams; of taking them\r\nupon their shoulders, with all their provisions, across\r\ncarrying-places; and of traversing, and frequently repassing, for the\r\npurpose of bringing their baggage, deep morasses, thick woods, and\r\nhigh mountains. These impediments, notwithstanding the zealous and\r\nwonderfully persevering exertions of his men, so protracted his march,\r\nthat, though he had expected certainly to enter Canada about the\r\nmiddle of October, he did not reach the first settlements on the\r\nChaudiere, which empties itself into the St. Lawrence near Quebec,\r\nuntil the third of November.\r\n\r\n\"On the high grounds which separate the waters of the Kennebec from\r\nthose of the St. Lawrence, the scanty remnant of provisions was\r\ndivided among the companies, each of which was directed, without\r\nattempting to preserve any connexion with another, to march with the\r\nutmost possible celerity into the inhabited country. While those who\r\ngained the front were yet thirty miles from the first poor and\r\nscattered habitations which composed that frontier of Canada, their\r\nlast morsel of food was consumed. But, preceded by Arnold, who went\r\nforward for the purpose of procuring for them something which might\r\nsatisfy the first demands of nature, the troops still persevered in\r\ntheir labours, with a vigour unimpaired by the hardships they had\r\nencountered, until they once more found themselves in regions\r\nfrequented by human beings.\" [1]\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Arnold's detachment at Chaudiere Pond, Burr was\r\ndespatched with a verbal communication to General Montgomery. He\r\ndisguised himself as a young Catholic priest. In this order of men he\r\nwas willing to repose confidence. He knew that the French Catholics\r\nwere not satisfied with their situation under the provincial\r\ngovernment; but especially the priesthood. Feeling no apprehension for\r\nhis own safety from treachery, he proceeded to a learned and reverend\r\nfather of the church, to whom he communicated frankly who he was, and\r\nwhat was his object. Burr was master of the Latin language, and had an\r\nimperfect knowledge of the French. The priest was an educated man, so\r\nthat a conversation was held with but little difficulty. He\r\nendeavoured to dissuade Burr from the enterprise. Spoke of it as\r\nimpossible to accomplish. He represented the distance as great, and\r\nthrough an enemy's country. The boyish appearance of Burr induced the\r\nreverend divine to consider him a mere child. Discovering, however,\r\nthe settled purpose of the young adventurer, the priest procured him a\r\nconfidential guide and a cabriolet (for the ground was now covered\r\nwith snow), and, thus prepared, he started on his journey. Without\r\ninterruption, he was conducted in perfect safety from one religious\r\nfamily to another, until he arrived at Three Rivers. Here the guide\r\nbecame alarmed in consequence of some rumours as to the arrival of\r\nArnold at the Chaudiere, and that he had despatched messengers to\r\nMontgomery to announce to him the fact. Under strong apprehensions,\r\nthe guide refused to proceed any farther, and recommended to Burr to\r\nremain a few days until these rumours subsided. To this he was\r\ncompelled to accede; and, for greater security, he was secreted three\r\ndays in a convent at that place. At the expiration of this period he\r\nagain set off, and reached Montgomery without further detention or\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at headquarters, he explained to the general the\r\ncharacter of the re-enforcement he was about to receive; the probable\r\nnumber of effective men, and the time at which their arrival might be\r\nanticipated. General Montgomery was so well pleased with the details\r\nwhich had been given him, and the manner in which young Burr had\r\neffected his journey after leaving Arnold, that he invited him (Burr)\r\nto reside at headquarters, assuring him that he should receive an\r\nappointment as one of his aids. At this time Montgomery was a\r\nbrigadier, and not entitled to aids, only in virtue of his being\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army. Previous to his death, however, he was\r\nappointed a major-general, but the information did not reach him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Burr had joined the family of the general, he entered upon\r\nthe duties of an aid; but no formal annunciation was made until the\r\narmy arrived before Quebec, when his appointment was announced in\r\ngeneral orders. Arnold arrived at Point Levi, opposite to Quebec, on\r\nthe 9th of November, 1775. He paraded for some days on the heights\r\nnear the town, and sent two flags to demand a surrender, but both were\r\nfired upon as rebels with whom no communication was to be held. The\r\ntrue reason, however, was, that Colonel M'Clean, the British\r\ncommandant, a vigilant and experienced officer, knowing the weakness\r\nof his own garrison, deemed it impolitic, if not unsafe, to receive a\r\nflag from Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe first plan for the attack upon the British works was essentially\r\ndifferent from that which was subsequently carried into execution.\r\nVarious reasons have been assigned for this change. Judge Marshall\r\nsays, \"that while the general (Montgomery) was making the necessary\r\npreparations for the assault, the garrison received intelligence of\r\nhis intention from a deserter. This circumstance induced him to change\r\nthe plan of his attack, which had been originally to attempt both the\r\nupper and lower towns at the same time. The plan now resolved on was\r\nto divide the army into four parts; and while two of them, consisting\r\nof Canadians under Major Livingston, and a small party under Major\r\nBrown, were to distract the attention of the garrison by making two\r\nfeints against the upper town of St. Johns and Cape Diamond, the other\r\ntwo, led, the one by Montgomery in person, and the other by Arnold,\r\nwere to make real attacks on opposite sides of the lower town.\" [2]\r\n\r\nColonel Burr says, that a change of the plan of attack was produced,\r\nin a great measure, through the advice and influence of Mr. Antill, a\r\nresident in Canada, who had joined the army; and Mr. Price, a Montreal\r\nmerchant of property and respectability, who had also come out and\r\nunited his destiny with the cause of the colonies. Mr. Price, in\r\nparticular, was strongly impressed with the opinion, that if the\r\nAmerican troops could obtain possession of the lower town, the\r\nmerchants and other wealthy inhabitants would have sufficient\r\ninfluence with the British commander-in-chief to induce him to\r\nsurrender rather than jeopard the destruction of all their property.\r\nIt was, as Colonel Burr thought, a most fatal delusion. But it is\r\nbelieved that the opinion was honestly entertained.\r\n\r\nThe first plan of the attack was agreed upon in a council, at which\r\nyoung Burr and his friend, Matthias Ogden, were present. The\r\narrangement was to pass over the highest walls at Cape Diamond. Here\r\nthere was a bastion. This was at a distance of about half a mile from\r\nany succour; but being considered, in some measure, impregnable, the\r\nleast resistance might be anticipated in that quarter. Subsequent\r\nevents tended to prove the soundness of this opinion. In pursuance of\r\nthe second plan, Major Livingston, with a detachment under his\r\ncommand, made a feint upon Cape Diamond; but, for about half an hour,\r\nwith all the noise and alarm that he and his men could create, he was\r\nunable to attract the slightest notice from the enemy, so completely\r\nunprepared were they at this point.\r\n\r\nWhile the first was the favourite plan of attack, Burr requested\r\nGeneral Montgomery to give him the command of a small forlorn hope,\r\nwhich request was granted, and forty men allotted to him. Ladders were\r\nprepared, and these men kept in constant drill, until they could\r\nascend them (standing almost perpendicular), with their muskets and\r\naccoutrements, with nearly the same facility that they could mount an\r\nordinary staircase. In the success of this plan of attack Burr had\r\nentire confidence; but, when it was changed, he entertained strong\r\napprehensions of the result. He was in the habit, every night, of\r\nvisiting and reconnoitring the ground about Cape Diamond, until he\r\nbecame perfectly familiarized with every inch adjacent to, or in the\r\nvicinity of, the intended point of assault.\r\n\r\nWhen the attack was about to be commenced, Captain Burr, and other\r\nofficers near General Montgomery, endeavoured to dissuade him from\r\nleading in the advance; remarking that, as commander-in-chief, it was\r\nnot his place. But all argument was ineffectual and unavailing. The\r\nattack was made on the morning of the 31st of December, 1775, before\r\ndaylight, in the midst of a violent snow-storm. The New-York troops\r\nwere commanded by General Montgomery, who advanced along the St.\r\nLawrence, by the way of Aunce de Mere, under Cape Diamond. The first\r\nbarrier to be surmounted was at the Pot Ash. In front of it was a\r\nblock-house and picket, in charge of some Canadians, who, after making\r\na single fire, fled in confusion. On advancing to force the barrier,\r\nan accidental discharge of a piece of artillery from the British\r\nbattery, when the American front was within forty paces of it, killed\r\nGeneral Montgomery, Captain McPherson, one of his aids, Captain\r\nCheeseman, and every other person in front, except Captain Burr and a\r\nFrench guide. General Montgomery was within a few feet of Captain\r\nBurr; and Colonel Trumbull, in a superb painting recently executed by\r\nhim, descriptive of the assault upon Quebec, has drawn the general\r\nfalling in the arms of his surviving aid-de-camp. Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCampbell, being the senior officer on the ground, assumed the command,\r\nand ordered a retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Marshall's Life of Washington\r\n\r\n2. Marshall's Life of Washington, vol. i., p. 329.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo evince the high sense entertained by his country for the services\r\nof General Montgomery, Congress directed a monument to be erected,\r\nwith an inscription sacred to his memory. They \"_Resolved_, That, to\r\nexpress the veneration of the United Colonies for their late general,\r\nRichard Montgomery, and the deep sense they entertained of the many\r\nsignal and important services of that gallant officer, who, after a\r\nseries of successes, amid the most discouraging difficulties, fell, at\r\nlength, in a gallant attack upon Quebec, the capital of Canada, and to\r\ntransmit to future ages, as examples truly worthy of imitation, his\r\npatriotism, conduct, boldness of enterprise, insuperable perseverance,\r\nand contempt of danger and death, a monument be procured from Paris,\r\nor other part of France, with an inscription sacred to his memory, and\r\nexpressive of his amiable character and heroic achievements; and that\r\nthe continental treasurer be directed to advance a sum, not exceeding\r\nthree hundred pounds sterling, to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, who is\r\ndesired to see this resolution properly executed, for defraying the\r\nexpenses thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolve was carried into execution at Paris by that ingenious\r\nartist, M. Caffieres, sculptor to Louis XVI., king of France, under\r\nthe direction of Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The monument is of white\r\nmarble, of the most beautiful simplicity and inexpressible elegance,\r\nwith emblematical devices, and the following truly classical\r\ninscription, worthy of the modest but great mind of Franklin.\r\n\r\nTO THE GLORY OF\r\n\r\nRICHARD MONTGOMERY,\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL OF THE ARMIES OF THE\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\nSLAIN AT THE SIEGE OF QUEBEC,\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-FIRST OF DECEMBER, 1775,\r\n\r\nAGED 38 YEARS.\r\n\r\nThis monument was erected in front of St. Paul's Church, in the city\r\nof New-York, in the spring of 1789.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arnold temporarily became commander-in-chief of the American\r\narmy near Quebec, and was accordingly removed to headquarters. Young\r\nBurr was now called upon to perform the duties of brigade major.\r\nArnold's plan was, by a close blockade, to starve out the enemy; but,\r\nfrom the weakness of his force, he soon discovered that this was\r\nimpracticable; and he knew that, on the opening of the spring, he\r\ncould not retain his present position, but must retreat. He therefore\r\nresolved to send in a flag of truce, and demand a surrender. He\r\ninformed Captain Burr that he was about to send him with a\r\ncommunication to General Carlton, the British commander. Captain Burr\r\nrequired that he should be made acquainted with its contents. Arnold\r\nobjected; whereupon Burr remarked that, if the general wished it, he\r\nwould resign; but that he could not consent to be the bearer of the\r\ncommunication without possessing a knowledge of its character. At\r\nlength, it was exhibited to him. It was demanding a surrender of the\r\nfortress, but in terms that Captain Burr considered unbecoming an\r\nAmerican officer, and he so stated to the general; adding, that the\r\nbearer of such a message, if he were permitted to deliver it, would be\r\ntreated by the British with contumely and contempt; and therefore\r\ndeclined the mission. Another officer was selected, and met the fate\r\nBurr anticipated. Shortly after (April 1st, 1776), General Wooster\r\narrived from Montreal and took the command. He was succeeded by\r\nGeneral Thomas about the 1st of May; and, on the 5th of May, it was\r\ndetermined in council to raise the blockade of Quebec, and that the\r\nsick and wounded should be immediately removed, with the artillery and\r\nstores, by boats, to Three Rivers, preparatory to a retreat.\r\n\r\nBurr's perseverance and zeal during the march through the wilderness\r\nwith Arnold, his subsequent boldness in joining Montgomery, and his\r\nintrepidity at the assault on Quebec, had acquired for him great\r\nreputation in the army, and had drawn towards him the attention of\r\nsome of the most distinguished Whigs in the United Provinces. From\r\nevery quarter he received highly complimentary letters. From a few of\r\nthem extracts are made. Colonel Antill, a resident of Montreal, who\r\nhad joined the American army, thus addresses him, five days after the\r\nfall of Montgomery:--\r\n\r\n\"La La Chine, 5th January, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\n\"I have desired Mr. Price to deliver you my pistols, which you will\r\nkeep until I see you. They are relics from my father's family, and\r\ntherefore I cannot give them to you. The general (Wooster) has thought\r\nproper to send me to the Congress, where I shall have an opportunity\r\nof speaking of you as you deserve.\r\n\r\n\"Yours,\r\n\r\n\"EDWARD ANTILL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, General Wooster writes from Montreal to General\r\nArnold:--\r\n\r\n\"Give my love to Burr, and desire him to remain with Colonel Clinton\r\nfor the present. [1] Not only him, but all those brave officers who\r\nhave so nobly distinguished themselves. I shall ever remember with\r\ngratitude and the highest degree of approbation, and shall not fail to\r\nrepresent them accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"DAVID WOOSTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a college-chum of great merit, he received a letter, dated\r\n\r\n\"Philadelphia, January 24th, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\n\"I am informed a gentleman is just setting off for Quebec, and snatch\r\nthe opportunity of at once condóling with you for the loss of your\r\nbrave general, and congratulating you on the credit you have gained in\r\nthat action. 'Tis said you behaved well--you behaved gallantly. I\r\nnever doubted but you would distinguish yourself, and your praise is\r\nnow in every man's mouth. It has been my theme of late. I will not say\r\nI was perfectly disinterested in the encomiums I bestowed. You were a\r\nson of Nassau Hall, and reflected honour on the place of _my_\r\neducation. You were my classmate and friend, and reflected honour on\r\nme. I make no doubt but your promotion will be taken care of. The\r\ngentlemen of the Congress speak highly of you.\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate,\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM BRADFORD, Jun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Judge Tappan Reeve writes--\r\n\r\n\"Stockbridge, January 27th, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\n\"Amid the lamentations of a country for the loss of a brave,\r\nenterprising general, your escape from such imminent danger, to which\r\nyou have been exposed, has afforded us the greatest satisfaction. The\r\nnews of the unfortunate attack upon Quebec arrived among us on the\r\n13th of this month. I concealed it from your sister until the 18th,\r\nwhen she found it out; but, in less than half an hour, I received\r\nletters from Albany, acquainting me that you were in safety, and had\r\ngained great honour by your intrepid conduct. It gave us a kind of\r\nhappiness that I should be very loath ever again to enjoy; for it\r\nnever can be the case until you have again been exposed to the like\r\ndanger, and have again escaped it, which I hope may never happen. To\r\nknow that you were in safety gave great pleasure. It was heightened by\r\nhearing that your conduct was brave. Could you have been crowned with\r\nsuccess, it would have been complete.\r\n\r\n\"It was happy for us that we did not know that you were an\r\naid-de-camp, until we heard of your welfare; for we heard that\r\nMontgomery and his aid-de-camps were killed, without knowing who his\r\naid-de-camps were.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister enjoys a middling state of health. She has many anxious\r\nhours upon your account; but she tells me that, as she believes you\r\nmay serve your country in the business in which you are now employed,\r\nshe is contented that you should remain in the army. It must be an\r\nexalted public spirit that could produce such an effect upon a sister\r\nas affectionate as yours.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu.\r\n\r\n\"T. REEVE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis friend, Jonathan Bellamy, writes, \"Norwich, March 3d, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n\"Be you yet alive? I have been infinitely distressed for you; but I\r\nhope it is now as safe with you as glorious. Doctor Jim Cogswell has\r\nleft the army. A few days ago I received a letter from him. 'I doubt\r\nnot,' he says, 'you have most sensible pleasure in the applauses\r\nbestowed on our friend Burr; when I hear of his gallant behaviour, I\r\nfeel exquisite delight.'\r\n\r\n\"Curse on this vile distance between us. I am restless to tell you\r\nevery thing; but uncertainty whether you would ever hear it bids me be\r\nsilent, till, in some future happy meeting, I may hold you to my\r\nbosom, and impart to you every emotion of my heart.\r\n\r\n\"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"JONA. BELLAMY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the repulse of the Americans at Quebec, his friend\r\nOgden returned to New-Jersey, but spent much of his time with the army\r\nin the city of New-York. He writes to Burr, dated\r\n\r\nNew-York, 20th March, 1776.\r\n\r\nSome weeks have elapsed since I saw Walker and Price. To-day I met\r\nwith Hopkins at this place. My first inquiry was for letters from you.\r\nI mean not to upbraid you. This is the third time of my writing since\r\nI left you. I shall continue it, with the hope of giving you some\r\nsmall satisfaction. Miss Dayton is well, and will soon be mine. Barber\r\nis appointed major in the third Jersey battalion, of which Dayton is\r\ncolonel, and Walton White lieutenant-colonel. Hancock was particular\r\nin his inquiry after you, and was disappointed in not receiving a line\r\nfrom you. I was kindly received on my arrival at Philadelphia. The\r\nCongress have since appointed me lieutenant-colonel in the first\r\nJersey battalion, in the room of Lieutenant-colonel Winds, who has the\r\nregiment in the stead of Lord Stirling, who is advanced to a\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\nColonel Allen, who hands you this, is much of a gentleman, and worthy\r\nyour attention. Melcher has hobbled himself. Inquire of Colonel Allen.\r\nGeneral Thompson commands. To-morrow my appointment will be announced\r\nin general orders, whereupon I shall join my regiment, but shall\r\nobtain leave of absence for a week or two. Elizabethtown swarms with\r\ngirls, among which is Miss Noel. I have not seen Miss Ricketts.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Philadelphia, Colonel Reed expressed a desire of serving\r\nme. He said there was a vacancy in General Washington's family, and\r\ndoubted not his recommendation would procure it for me. I declined it,\r\nhoping to get a more active office, but desired he would procure it\r\nfor you. If any thing offers at Quebec, accept it, as it will not\r\nhinder your appointment here. Washington is expected in New-York, when\r\nI shall have a better chance of bringing it about. The pay and rank\r\nare equal to a full major. I shall write you by Price. Miss Dayton is\r\nparticular in her inquiries after you.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nMATT. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1776, the army moved from Montreal to the mouth of\r\nthe Sorel. Major Burr yet remained with it. While at Montreal, he\r\nbecame disgusted with General Arnold, on account of his meanness and\r\nother bad qualities. On the march through the wilderness, he was far\r\nfrom being satisfied with the general. Burr thought he provided too\r\ncarefully for himself; and that he did not sufficiently share the\r\nfatigues and privations of the march in common with the troops.\r\nImmediately after arriving at the Sorel, he informed the general of\r\nhis desire to visit his friends, and to ascertain what was doing, as\r\nhe wished more active employment. General Arnold objected somewhat\r\npetulantly. Burr remarked courteously, but firmly, \"Sir, I have a boat\r\nin readiness. I have employed four discharged soldiers to row me, and\r\nI start to-morrow morning at six o'clock.\" He then designated the\r\npoint at which he should embark. Arnold forbade his departure,\r\nwhereupon Burr reiterated his determination.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the specified hour, he repaired to his boat, and\r\nshortly after discovered the general approaching. \"Why, Major Burr,\"\r\nsays he, \"you are not going?\"--\"I am, sir,\" replied the major. \"But\r\nyou know, sir, it is contrary to my wish and against my orders.\"--\"I\r\nknow, sir, that you have the _power_ of stopping me, but nothing short\r\nof force shall do it.\" The general then changed his tone and manner,\r\nand endeavoured to dissuade; but, after a few minutes' conversation,\r\nBurr wished him great success, then embarked, and took his departure\r\nwithout interruption.\r\n\r\nOn the Sorel an incident occurred which gave some alarm to the\r\nvoyagers. Burr had taken into his boat, as a kind of companion, a\r\nyoung merchant. On the borders of the river they suddenly discovered a\r\nlarge brick house, with wings, having loopholes to fire through, and\r\nin view, at the door, stood an Indian warrior, in full costume. The\r\noarsmen were for attempting to retreat. Burr said it was too late, as\r\nthey were within the reach of the Indians' rifles. The passenger was\r\nabout to stop the men from rowing, when Burr threatened to shoot him\r\nif he interfered. The inquiry was then made--\"What are we to do?\" The\r\nmajor replied, \"Row for the shore and land; I will go up to the house,\r\nand we shall soon learn what they are.\" By this time several other\r\nIndians had made their appearance. On reaching the shore, Burr took\r\nhis sword and proceeded to meet the red men. An explanation ensued,\r\nand it was ascertained that they were friendly. The stores were landed\r\nfrom the boat, and a merrimaking followed.\r\n\r\nMajor Burr continued his route to Albany. On his arrival, and while\r\nthere, he was notified verbally that it would be agreeable to the\r\ncommander-in-chief (General Washington) that he should visit New-York.\r\nHe forthwith proceeded down the river, and arrived in the city about\r\nthe 20th of May, 1776. He immediately reported himself to the\r\ncommander-in-chief, who invited him to join his family at headquarters\r\nuntil he received a satisfactory appointment. The quarters of General\r\nWashington were at that time in the house subsequently owned by\r\nColonel Burr, and known as Richmond Hill. This invitation was\r\naccepted, and Major Burr occasionally rode out with the general, but\r\nvery soon became restless and dissatisfied. He wrote to John Hancock,\r\nthen president of Congress, and who had been an intimate friend of his\r\nfather, that he was disgusted, and inclined to retire from the\r\nservice. Governor Hancock objected, and asked him whether he would\r\naccept the appointment of aid-de-camp to Major-general Putnam, then in\r\ncommand in the city of New-York. Burr consented, and removed from the\r\nheadquarters of the commander-in-chief to those of Major-general\r\nPutnam. About this period Burr received a letter from his friend, now\r\nLieutenant-colonel M. Ogden, who had proceeded to the north with his\r\nregiment. He writes,\r\n\r\nFort George, 5th June, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI this evening experienced the greatest disappointment I have met with\r\nsince my memory. I yesterday saw Mr. Price; he informed me that you\r\nwere on your way, in company with the commissioners, who, I was this\r\nday informed, were coming by the way of Skeenesborough. I altered my\r\ncourse, and went that way, till I met them on the road. They informed\r\nme you were coming by Lake George. I then turned about, very much\r\nafraid you would pass me before I came into the lake road. But what\r\nnecessity for enumerating all these circumstances? I have missed you.\r\nD--n the luck. I never so much desired, nor had occasion so much for\r\nan interview. I have not received a single line from you since I left\r\nCanada. Perhaps you have not written, or perhaps they have miscarried.\r\nIf they have miscarried, withered be the hand that held them back.\r\nTell me you omitted through carelessness, neglect, hurry of business,\r\nor any thing, rather than want of friendship.\r\n\r\n_General Washington desired me to inform you that he will provide for\r\nyou, and that he expects you will come to him immediately, and stay in\r\nhis family._ I should have acquainted you of this by letter, had I not\r\nexpected to have seen you. You will now want your horse. I have sold\r\nhim, and spent the money, and expect I shall not be able to refund it\r\nuntil my return.\r\n\r\nI am, if I ever was,\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nMATTHIAS OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the preceding letter was received by Major Burr, he felt piqued\r\nat what he supposed the coldness and neglect of his friend Ogden, and,\r\nunder the influence of such feelings, wrote the following:--\r\n\r\nNew-York, New-York, 18th Jane, 1776,\r\n\r\nDEAR OGDEN,\r\n\r\nA correspondence, which I flattered myself in former times was\r\nmutually agreeable, has of late somehow strangely found an end. You\r\nmay remember, when you left Canada, I engaged to answer your first\r\nletter immediately, and to continue writing from that time, by every\r\nopportunity, as usual. I concluded your letters must have miscarried,\r\nand wrote you a line by Mr. Avery. I had no direct intelligence from\r\nyou, till a verbal message by Mr. Duggan, the beginning of May. A few\r\ndays after, I received a letter from _Colonel Ogden_ by _Colonel\r\nAllen_. I should have answered it, but had determined to visit my\r\nnative colony, and expected, by personal interview, to answer purposes\r\nwhich I scarce hoped the cold medium of ink and paper could effect.\r\n\r\nThat I unfortunately missed you on my way hither, I need not relate.\r\nAt Albany I first heard you had passed me. I was upon the point of\r\nfollowing you; but the character of troublesome fool struck me in so\r\ndisagreeable a light, that, in spite of myself, I continued my\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThere is in man a certain love of novelty; a fondness of variety\r\n(useful, indeed, within proper limits), which influences more or less\r\nin almost every act of life. New views, new laws, new _friends_, have\r\neach their charm. Truly great must be the soul, and firm almost beyond\r\nthe weakness of humanity, that can withstand the smiles of fortune.\r\nSuccess, promotion, the caresses of the great, and the flatteries of\r\nthe low, are sometimes fatal to the noblest minds. The volatile become\r\nan easy prey. The fickle heart, tiptoe with joy, as from an eminence,\r\nviews with contempt its former joys, connexions, and pursuits. A new\r\ntaste contracted, seeks companions suited to itself. But pleasures\r\neasiest tasted, though perhaps at first of higher glee, are soonest\r\npast, and, the more they are relied upon, leave the severer sting\r\nbehind. One cloudy day despoils the glow-worm of all its glitter.\r\n\r\nShould fortune ever frown upon you, Matt.; should those you now call\r\nfriends forsake you; should the clouds gather force on every side, and\r\nthreaten to burst upon you, think then upon the man who never betrayed\r\nyou; rely on the sincerity you never found to fail; and if my heart,\r\nmy life, or my fortune can assist you, it is yours.\r\n\r\nI go to-morrow to Elizabethtown, where I shall see the best of\r\nwomen--your wife. Whatever letters or commands she may have for you, I\r\nshall be careful to forward by the safest hands.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nAARON BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of July, 1776, Major Burr was appointed aid-de-camp\r\nto General Putnam. At this time the headquarters of the general were\r\nin the large brick house, yet standing, at the corner of Broadway and\r\nthe Battery. Burr continued occasionally to correspond with his\r\nfriends, but was much occupied with his military duties, and those\r\nstudies which were calculated to render him scientifically master of\r\nhis profession. During the short period that he remained in the family\r\nof General Washington, he was treated with respect and attention; but\r\nsoon perceived, as he thought, an unwillingness to afford that\r\ninformation, and those technical explanations of great historical\r\nmilitary movements, which an inquiring and enlightened mind, like\r\nBurr's, sought with avidity and perseverance. He therefore became\r\napprehensive, if he remained with the commander-in-chief, that,\r\ninstead of becoming a scientific soldier, he should dwindle down into\r\na practical clerk--a species of drudgery to which his pecuniary\r\ncircumstances did not render it necessary for him to submit, and for\r\nwhich neither his habits, his education, nor his temperament in any\r\ndegree qualified him. He therefore determined promptly on a change,\r\nand was willing to enter the family of Major-general Putnam, because\r\nhe would there enjoy the opportunities for study, and the duties which\r\nhe would be required to perform would be strictly military. There is\r\nno doubt the short residence of Major Burr with General Washington\r\nlaid the foundation for those prejudices which, at a future day,\r\nripened into hostile feelings on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Paterson thus writes him:--\r\n\r\nNew-Brunswick, July 22d, 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI did myself the pleasure of writing you by my brother, who is in\r\nGeneral Sullivan's brigade, and who was in expectation of seeing you,\r\nas he was destined for the Canada department. Indeed, from the\r\nfriendship which subsisted between us, I was in expectation of hearing\r\nfrequently from you, and, to tell the truth, was not a little\r\nmortified that I was passed over in silence. Why, Burr, all this\r\nnegligence? I dare not call it forgetfullness, for I cannot bear the\r\nthought of giving up my place in your esteem. I rejoice at your\r\nreturn, and congratulate you on your promotion. I was attending the\r\nconvention at Burlington when you passed on to Philadelphia, and was\r\nfull of the pleasing hope of having an interview with you. The\r\nDelaware, indeed, ran between us--a mighty obstacle, to be sure! I\r\ninquired when you designed to return, that I might plant myself at\r\nBristol, and intercept you on your way. The inquiry was of no avail. I\r\nhave at times been violently tempted to write you a railing letter,\r\nand for that purpose have more than once taken up the pen. But I can\r\nhardly tell how, on such occasions, the Genius of Friendship would\r\nrise up to view, and soften me down into all the tenderness of\r\naffectionate sorrow--perhaps because I counted you as lost. I find I\r\nmust e'en forgive you--but, remember, you must behave better in\r\nfuture. Do write me now and then. Your letters will give me unfeigned\r\npleasure, and, for your encouragement, I promise to be a faithful\r\ncorrespondent. In the letter-way you used to be extremely careless;\r\nyou know I am, in that respect, of a different turn.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by Mr. Hugg and Mr. Leaming, members of our\r\nconvention, whom curiosity partly, and partly business, have impelled\r\nto New-York. As men, they are genteel, sensible, and deserving. As\r\npoliticians, they are worthy of your regard, for they possess the\r\ngenuine spirit of whiggism. They have no acquaintance in York. They\r\nare desirous of seeing the fortifications, and other things in the\r\nmilitary line. Pray take them by the hand; and be assured 'that any\r\nkindness shown them will be acknowledged as an additional obligation\r\nconferred upon\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nWM. PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Burr replies to this letter:--\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 26th, 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PATERSON,\r\n\r\nI this day received your kind letter. It gave me a pleasure I seldom\r\nexperience. Can it be that you have still in memory the vagrant Burr?\r\nSome fatality has ever attended our endeavours to meet. Why I have not\r\nwritten to you I cannot tell. It has not been for want of friendship,\r\nof inclination, or always of opportunity; but some unavoidable\r\naccidents prevented so long, that I began to fear a letter from me\r\nmust be ushered in by some previous introduction, some anecdotes of\r\nthe writer, which might renew your remembrance, and authorize a\r\nfreedom of this nature. But your frank and kind epistle precludes\r\nfulsome apologies, which; though sometimes necessary, I esteem, at\r\nbest, but a drug in letters.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly pleased with your friends, Messrs. Hugg and Learning,\r\nbut was unfortunate enough to be from home the day they came in town,\r\nand had not the pleasure of seeing them till this afternoon. I felt\r\nmyself so nearly interested in the welfare of the province whose\r\nconstitution you are now framing, that I did not urge their stay with\r\nthe warmth my inclination prompted. If any other of our Jersey friends\r\nshould be coming this way, I should be happy in showing them every\r\ncivility in my power.\r\n\r\nAs to promises of writing, I shall make you none, my dear Bill, till\r\nthose already on hand, and of long standing, are discharged. I am no\r\nepistolary politician or newsmonger; and as to sentiments, a variety\r\nof novelties and follies has entirely dissipated them. This, however,\r\nis only a new apology for an old misfortune. But why this to you, who\r\nknow me better than I know myself? This epistolary chat, though\r\nagreeable, is by no means satisfactory. The sincerity of my\r\nlong-smothered affections is not to be thus expressed. I must contrive\r\nto shake you by the hand. Perhaps I may, ere long, be sent to\r\nElizabethtown or Amboy on business, and will, undoubtedly, take\r\nBrunswick in my way. I have, or had once, an agreeable female\r\nacquaintance with Miss S. D., now Mrs. S., and with Miss S. was on\r\ntolerable terms of intimacy. Could I but reconnoitre a while, and find\r\nhow the land lay, I might, perhaps, be able to graduate my compliments\r\nwith some propriety, from cold respects to affectionate regards. I\r\nthink I must leave you discretionary orders on this head, begging you\r\nto make use of all the policy of war. There is no knowing of what\r\nimportance it may be to\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. James Clinton, afterwards general, brother of Governor George\r\nClinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1780 until the year 1795, Mrs. Margaret Coghlan made no\r\ninconsiderable noise in the court and fashionable circles of Great\r\nBritain and France. She was the theme of conversation among the lords,\r\nand the dukes, and the M. P.'s. Having become the victim, in early\r\nlife, of licentious, dissolute, and extravagant conduct, alternately\r\nshe was revelling in wealth, and then sunken in poverty. At length, in\r\n1793, she published her own memoirs. Mrs. Coghlan was the daughter of\r\nMajor Moncrieffe, of the British army. He was Lord Cornwallis's\r\nbrigade major. Her father had three wives. She was a daughter of the\r\nfirst wife. His second wife was Miss L*********, of New-York, and his\r\nthird wife Miss J**, of New-York. Mrs. Coghlan is introduced here,\r\nbecause her early history is intimately connected with the subject of\r\nthese memoirs.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, she resided in Elizabethtown, New-Jersey. Her father\r\nwas with Lord Percy on Staten Island. In her memoirs, speaking of\r\nherself, she says:--\"Thus destitute of friends, I wrote to General\r\nPutnam, who instantly answered my letter by a very kind invitation to\r\nhis house, assuring me that he respected my father, and was only his\r\nenemy in the field of battle; but that, in private life, he himself,\r\nor any part of his family, might always command his services. On the\r\nnext day he sent Colonel Webb, one of his aid-de-camps, to conduct me\r\nto New-York. When I arrived in the Broadway (a street so called),\r\nwhere General Putnam resided, I was received with great tenderness,\r\nboth by Mrs. Putnam and her daughters, and on the following day I was\r\nintroduced by them to General and Mrs. Washington, who likewise made\r\nit their study to show me every mark of regard; but I seldom was\r\nallowed to be alone, although sometimes, indeed, I found an\r\nopportunity to escape to the gallery on the top of the house, where my\r\nchief delight was to view, with a telescope, our fleet and army at\r\nStaten Island. My amusements were few; the good Mrs. Putnam employed\r\nme and her daughters constantly to spin flax for shirts for the\r\nAmerican soldiers; indolence, in America, being totally discouraged;\r\nand I likewise worked some for General Putnam, who, though not an\r\naccomplished _muscadin_, like our dilletantis of St. James's-street,\r\nwas certainly one of the best characters in the world; His heart being\r\ncomposed of those noble materials which equally command respect and\r\nadmiration. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Not long after this circumstance, a flag of truce arrived from Staten\r\nIsland, with letters from Major Moncrieffe, demanding me; for he now\r\nconsidered me as a prisoner. General Washington would not acquiesce in\r\nthis demand, saying that I should remain a hostage for my father's\r\ngood behaviour. I must here observe, that when General Washington\r\nrefused to deliver me up, the noble-minded Putnam, as if it were by\r\ninstinct, laid his hand on his sword, and with a violent oath swore\r\nthat my father's request should be granted. The commander-in-chief,\r\nwhose influence governed Congress, soon prevailed on them to consider\r\nme as a person whose situation required their strict attention; and\r\nthat I might not escape they ordered me to Kingsbridge, where, in\r\njustice I must say, that I was treated with the utmost tenderness.\r\nGeneral Mifflin there commanded. His lady was a most accomplished,\r\nbeautiful woman; a Quaker,\" &c.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coghlan then bursts forth in expressions of rapture for a young\r\nAmerican officer, with whom she had become enamoured. She does not\r\nname him; but that officer was Major Burr. \"May these pages\" (she\r\nsays) \"one day meet the eye of him who subdued my virgin heart. * * *\r\n* * To him I plighted my virgin vow. * * * * * * With this conqueror\r\nof my soul, how happy should I now have been! What storms and tempests\r\nshould I have avoided\" (at least I am pleased to think so) \"if I had\r\nbeen allowed to follow the bent of my inclinations. Ten thousand times\r\nhappier should I have been with him in the wildest desert of our\r\nnative country, the woods affording us our only shelter, and their\r\nfruits our only repast, than under the canopy of costly state, with\r\nall the refinements of courts, with the royal warrior\" (the Duke of\r\nYork) \"who would fain have proved himself the conqueror of France. _My\r\nconqueror_ was engaged in another cause; he was ambitious to obtain\r\nother laurels. He fought to liberate, not to enslave nations. He was a\r\ncolonel in the American army, and high in the estimation of his\r\ncountry. _His_ victories were never accompanied with one gloomy,\r\nrelenting thought. They shone as bright as the cause which achieved\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter from General Putnam of which Mrs. Coghlan speaks is found\r\namong the papers of Colonel Burr, and is in the following words:--\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 26th, 1776.\r\n\r\nI should have answered your letter sooner, but had it not in my power\r\nto write you any thing satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe omission of my title, in Major Moncrieffe's letter, is a matter I\r\nregard not in the least; nor does it in any way influence my conduct\r\nin this affair; as you seem to imagine. Any political difference\r\nalters him not to me in a private capacity. As an officer, he is my\r\nenemy, and obliged to act as such, be his private sentiments what they\r\nwill. As a man, I owe him no enmity; but, far from it, will, with\r\npleasure, do any kind office in my power for him or any of his\r\nconnexions.\r\n\r\nI have, agreeably to your desire, waited on his excellency to\r\nendeavour to obtain permission for you to go to Staten Island. He\r\ninforms me that Lieutenant-colonel Patterson, who came with the last\r\nflag, said he was empowered to offer the exchange of ----- ----- for\r\nGovernor Skeene. As the Congress have reserved to themselves the right\r\nof exchanging prisoners, the general has sent to know their pleasure,\r\nand doubts not they will give their consent. I am desired to inform\r\nyou, that if this exchange is made, you will have liberty to pass out\r\nwith Governor Skeene; but that no flag will be sent solely for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMajor William Livingston was lately here, and informed me that you had\r\nan inclination to live in this city, and that all the ladies of your\r\nacquaintance having left town, and Mrs. Putnam and two daughters being\r\nhere, proposed your staying with them. If agreeable to you, be\r\nassured, miss, you shall be sincerely welcome. You will here, I think,\r\nbe in a more probable way of accomplishing the end you wish--that of\r\nseeing your father, and may depend upon every civility from,\r\n\r\nMiss,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nISRAEL PUTNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is in the handwriting of Major Burr, and undoubtedly was\r\nprepared by him for the signature of the general. Miss Moncrieffe was,\r\nat this time, in her fourteenth year. She had travelled, and, for one\r\nof her age, had mingled much in the world. She was accomplished, and\r\nwas considered handsome. Major Burr was attracted by her sprightliness\r\nand vivacity, and she, according to her own confessions, penned nearly\r\ntwenty years afterward, had not only become violently in love with,\r\nbut had acknowledged the fact to him. Whether the foundation of her\r\nfuture misfortunes was now laid, it is not necessary to inquire. Her\r\nindiscretion was evident, while Major Burr's propensity for intrigue\r\nwas already well known.\r\n\r\nBurr perceived immediately that she was an extraordinary young woman.\r\nEccentric and volatile, but endowed with talents, natural as well as\r\nacquired, of a peculiar character. Residing in the family of General\r\nPutnam with her, and enjoying the opportunity of a close and intimate\r\nintercourse, at all times and on all occasions, he was enabled to\r\njudge of her qualifications, and came to the conclusion,\r\nnotwithstanding her youth, that she was well calculated for a spy, and\r\nthought it not improbable that she might be employed in that capacity\r\nby the British. Major Burr suggested his suspicions to General Putnam,\r\nand recommended that she be conveyed to her friends as soon as might\r\nbe convenient. She was, in consequence, soon after removed to\r\nKingsbridge, where General Mifflin commanded. This change of\r\nsituation, in the work which she has published, is ascribed to General\r\nWashington, but it originated with Major Burr.\r\n\r\nAfter a short residence at Kingsbridge, leave was granted for her\r\ndeparture to Staten Island. She accordingly set off in a continental\r\nbarge, under the escort of an American officer, who was ordered to\r\naccompany her to the British headquarters. As the boat approached the\r\nEnglish fleet, she was met by another, having on board a British\r\nofficer, and was notified that she could proceed no further, but that\r\nthe king's officer would take charge of the young lady, and convey her\r\nin safety to her father, who was six or eight miles in the country\r\nwith Lord Percy. She says, in her memoirs, \"I then entered the British\r\nbarge, and bidding an eternal farewell to my dear American friends,\r\n_turned my back on liberty_.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Moncrieffe, before she had reached her fourteenth year, was\r\nprobably the victim of seduction. The language of her memoirs, when\r\ntaken in connexion with her deportment soon after her marriage, leaves\r\nbut little room for doubt. Major Burr, while yet at college, had\r\nacquired a reputation for gallantry. On this point he was excessively\r\nvain, and regardless of all those ties which ought to control an\r\nhonourable mind. In his intercourse with females he was an\r\nunprincipled flatterer, ever prepared to take advantage of their\r\nweakness, their credulity, or their confidence. She that confided in\r\nhim was lost. In referring to this subject, no terms of condemnation\r\nwould be too strong to apply to Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\nIt is truly surprising how any individual could have become so eminent\r\nas a soldier, as a statesman, and as a professional man, who devoted\r\nso much time to the other sex as was devoted by Colonel Burr. For more\r\nthan half a century of his life they seemed to absorb his whole\r\nthoughts. His intrigues were without number. His conduct most\r\nlicentious. The sacred bonds of friendship were unhesitatingly\r\nviolated when they operated as barriers to the indulgence of his\r\npassions. For a long period of time he seemed to be gathering, and\r\ncarefully preserving, every line written to him by any female, whether\r\nwith or without reputation; and, when obtained, they were cast into\r\none common receptacle,--the profligate and corrupt, by the side of the\r\nthoughtless and betrayed victim. All were held as trophies of\r\nvictory,--all esteemed alike valuable. How shocking to the man of\r\nsensibility! How mortifying and heart-sickening to the intellectual,\r\nthe artless, the fallen fair!\r\n\r\nAmong these manuscripts were many the production of highly cultivated\r\nminds. They were calculated to excite the sympathy of the brother--the\r\nparent--the husband. They were, indeed, testimonials of the weakness\r\nof the weaker sex, even where genius and learning would seem to be\r\ntowering above the arts of the seducer. Why they were thus carefully\r\npreserved, is left to conjecture. Can it be true that Moore is\r\ncorrect, when, in his life of Lord Byron, he says, \"The allusions\r\nwhich he (Byron) makes to instances of _successful passion_ in his\r\ncareer, were not without their influence on the fancies of that sex,\r\nwhose weakness it is to be most easily won by those who come\r\nrecommended by the greatest number of triumphs over others? Some of\r\nthese productions had been penned more than sixty years. They were all\r\ncommitted to the flames, however, immediately after the decease of\r\nColonel Burr. Of them, it is believed, \"not a wreck remains.\"\r\n\r\nThe faithful biographer could not pass over in silence this strong and\r\nrevolting trait in the character of Colonel Burr. It will not again be\r\nreferred to. From details, the moralist and the good man must shrink\r\nwith disgust and abhorrence. In this particular, Burr appears to have\r\nbeen unfeeling and heartless. And yet, by a fascinating power almost\r\npeculiar to himself, he so managed as to retain the affection, in some\r\ninstances, the devotion, of his deluded victims. In every other\r\nrespect he was kind and charitable. No man would go farther to\r\nalleviate the sufferings of another. No man was more benevolent. No\r\nman would make greater sacrifices to promote the interest or the\r\nhappiness of a friend. How strange, how inconsistent, how conflicting\r\nare these allusions! They are nevertheless strictly true.\r\n\r\nMany of the letters to and from Colonel Burr contain hints and\r\nopinions as to public men and measures. Thus far, they are links in\r\nthe chain of history, in relation to the times when they were written.\r\nThey serve, also, to illustrate the character and the principles of\r\nthe writers themselves. With these views they are occasionally\r\nselected. Theodore Sedgwick is a name recorded in the annals of our\r\ncountry with distinction. He writes to Burr:--\r\n\r\n\r\nSheffield, 7th August, 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nIf you remember, some months since, you and I mutually engaged to\r\ncorrespond by letter. I told you then that you were not to expect any\r\nthing either entertaining, or in any degree worth the trouble of\r\nperusing. What can a reasonable being expect from an inhabitant of\r\nsuch an obscure, remote, and dead place as Sheffield, to amuse,\r\ninstruct, or even to merit the attention of a young, gay,\r\nenterprising, martial genius? I know you will expect nothing, and I\r\ndare pledge my honour, therefore, that you will not, either now or in\r\nfuture, in this respect, be disappointed.\r\n\r\nYou recollect, perhaps, that when I had the pleasure to see you here,\r\nI informed you of a design to visit New-York and the southward. Soon\r\nafter my business called me to Boston, and, on my return, I was\r\nobliged to go with the militia to Peekskill; from there I should have\r\nvisited the city and my friends, had not some foolish accidents\r\nprevented. I now think, as soon as I can leave home, of making a tour;\r\nbut this, like other futurities, is wholly uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe insignificant figure I make, in my own opinion, in this day of\r\npolitical and martial exertions, is an humbling consideration. To be\r\nstoically indifferent to the great events that are now unfolding, is\r\naltogether inconsistent, not only with my inclination, but even with\r\nmy natural constitution; and to pursue a line of conduct which\r\nindicates such a disposition (I mean my continuance at home), is a\r\nmystery for which I will endeavour to account. Remember, I do not\r\nintend to libel the colony to which I belong.\r\n\r\nAmid the confusion which was at once the cause and consequence of a\r\ndissolution of government, men's minds as well as actions became\r\nregardless of all legal restraint. All power reverted into the hands\r\nof the people, who were determined that every one should be convinced\r\nthat _the people_ were the fountain of all honour. The first thing\r\nthey did was to withdraw all confidence from every one who had ever\r\nany connexion with government. Lawyers were, almost universally,\r\nrepresented as the pests of society. All persons who would pay court\r\nto these extravagant and unreasonable prejudices became their idols.\r\nAbilities were represented as dangerous, and learning as a crime, or\r\nrather, the certain forerunner of all political extravagances. They\r\nreally demonstrated that they were possessed of creating power; _for,\r\nby the word of their power, they created great men out of nothing_;\r\nbut I cannot say _that all was very well_.\r\n\r\nObserving these violent symptoms, I could not pursue that which was\r\nthe only road to preferment; and I have never had an offer to go into\r\nthe army, except the one I accepted; while I have seen, in more than\r\none instance, men honoured with the command of a regiment for heading\r\nmobs. Well: with this, I believe, I have troubled you long enough.\r\nPray, say you, what is it to me why you have not been in the army?\r\nWhy, nothing, my dear friend; but it is something to me. You know, my\r\ndear Burr, I love you, or I should not submit such nonsense to your\r\nperusal. If Mr. Swift still lives, give him my best compliments.\r\nPamela desires me to tell you she loves you. Answer this letter, and\r\nthereby oblige\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\nTHEODORE SEDGWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL M. OGDEN.\r\n\r\nTiconderoga, July 26th, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI have been waiting with the greatest impatience to know what is doing\r\nin York and Jersey. There are twenty different reports, that\r\ncontradict each other, relative to Howe and his fleet. It has once\r\nbeen generally believed that a French fleet had arrived at New-York,\r\nand blocked up the British army. Independence is well relished in this\r\npart of the world. Generalship is now dealt out to the army by our\r\nworthy and well-esteemed general, Gates, who is putting the most\r\ndisordered army that ever bore the name into a state of regularity and\r\ndefence. If our friends in Canada, commanded by Burgoyne, will wait a\r\nfew days, we shall give them a very proper reception.\r\n\r\nThe army are beginning to recruit fast, from the effects of a little\r\nfresh meat, and some rum, when on fatigue. Ten days ago there were not\r\nin our regiment eighty men fit for duty. We have now upwards of two\r\nhundred and thirty; and, in a few days, they will be all as rugged as\r\nNew-Jersey is firm.\r\n\r\nColonel Winds is sent home on a fool's errand by the general, that he\r\nmay be out of the way of doing any more harm to the regiment. The\r\ngeneral assures me that I shall not be troubled with him again. I\r\nsuppose, by that, he has written to have him detained below. A short\r\nhistory of this man will convince you that he ought to be nowhere but\r\non his farm. He, in the first place, is a professed enemy to\r\nsubordination, and has an utter aversion to discipline. He is\r\npositive, and prefers his own opinion to even the general's, because\r\nhe was in the service last war. He is not possessed of one\r\nqualification that distinguishes a gentleman, nor has he genius or\r\neducation. His whole study is to gain the applause of the private\r\nsoldiers, at the expense of every officer in the regiment. He is hated\r\nby all his own officers except _two_, and despised by every gentleman\r\nin the army.\r\n\r\nWe are in great want of brigadier-generals--three, at least. I mean\r\nfor the men that are now here. General Arnold will command the\r\nwater-craft on the lake in person. There are three brigades, commanded\r\nby the colonels, Reed, Stark, and St. Clair. The last of these I\r\nsincerely wish was appointed a brigadier by Congress. There is no\r\nbetter man; the other two have full enough already.\r\n\r\nPlease to forward the enclosed, with the letter to Mr. Spencer. My\r\nbest respects to Generals Putnam, Greene, and Mifflin, and to Colonel\r\nTrumbull. Compliments to Webb. I wait, with the greatest impatience,\r\nsome important news from New-York. Pray write particulars relative to\r\nthe conduct of the Jerseymen. Should any fall, mention their names.\r\n\r\nI am yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nMATT. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. EDWARDS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 10th of August, 1776.\r\n\r\nDear Uncle,\r\n\r\nI have received your letters from Stockbridge, with my watch, for\r\nwhich I thank you. Our six galleys which went up the North river\r\nattacked the British ships. They behaved well, but were drove off with\r\nthe loss of three killed and twelve or thirteen wounded. A second\r\nattack is proposed. Vessels and chevaux-de-frises are sunk in the\r\nNorth river. The channel is said to be effectually stopped. We are\r\nendeavouring the same in the East river. The British fleet have been\r\nlargely re-enforced at different times. They are now said to be\r\nupwards of two hundred sail within the Narrows. They have drawn up\r\nseven of their heaviest ships in a line, nearly two miles advanced of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nBy two Virginia gentlemen who went to England to take the gown, who\r\nreturned in a packet and landed on Staten Island, where they tarried\r\nseveral days, and were permitted to cross to Elizabethtown on Thursday\r\nlast, we have some intelligence of the enemy. Clinton has arrived with\r\nhis shattered fleet and about 3600 men. By this it appears that he has\r\neither fallen in with part of Dunmore's fleet, or picked up the\r\nremainder of his own, which had been separated, and were not in the\r\naction near Charlestown. Of the Hessians only 1300 or 1400 have\r\narrived. The remainder, about 9000, are daily expected. They were left\r\nnear the banks of Newfoundland. Those already here are not much\r\nesteemed as soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe king's land-army is at present about 15 or 16,000 strong. They\r\nexpect very soon to exceed 25,000. They have taken on board all their\r\nheavy cannon from Staten Island, and have called in several of their\r\noutposts. Thirty transports have sailed under convoy of three\r\nfrigates. They are to come through the Sound, and thus invest us by\r\nthe North and East rivers. They are then to land on both sides of the\r\nisland, _join their forces, and draw a line across, which will hem us\r\nin and totally cut off all communication, after which they will have\r\ntheir own fun_.\r\n\r\nThese Virginia gentlemen lodged in a house with several king's\r\nofficers. They hold us in the utmost contempt. Talk of forcing all our\r\nlines without firing a gun. The bayonet is their pride. They have\r\nforgot Bunker's Hill.\r\n\r\nYour nephew,\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL M. OGDEN.\r\n\r\nTiconderoga, August 11th, 1776.\r\n\r\nDear Burr,\r\n\r\nI yesterday received yours of July 29th and August 2d. The others I\r\nmade mention of in the letter to Mrs. Ogden that I sent to you\r\nunsealed. In my last you had a very particular account of the numbers,\r\nforce, names, &c., of our navy on the lake. As to our leaving\r\nCrownpoint for this place, the field-officers knew nothing of it till\r\nit was concluded on by the generals, Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arnold is taking a very active part, I mean in the command of\r\nthe fleet. He will sail himself in a few days. He says he will pay a\r\nvisit to St. Johns. I wish he may be as prudent as he is brave. Well,\r\nnow have at you for news. Last evening the flag of truce returned,\r\nbringing a letter directed to _George Washington, Esq_., and a truly\r\nridiculous copy of a general order, which you will see at General\r\nWashington's by the time you receive this. But there is one part of it\r\nin which I think they, in some measure, accuse us justly. I mean that\r\nof assassinating, as they term it with too much truth,\r\nBrigadier-general Gordon. He was shot by the Whitcomb I mentioned in\r\nmy last, who had been sent there as a spy. The act, though villainous,\r\nwas brave, and a peculiar kind of bravery, that, I believe, Whitcomb\r\nalone is possessed of. He shot Gordon near by their advanced sentinel;\r\nand, notwithstanding a most diligent search was made, he avoided them\r\nby mere dint of skulking.\r\n\r\nI shall have the honour to command the New-Jersey redoubt, which I am\r\nnow building with the regiment alone. It is situated on the right of\r\nthe whole, by the water's edge. It is to mount two eighteen-pounders,\r\ntwo twelve, and four nine-pounders. In this I expect to do honour to\r\nNew-Jersey. I yesterday received a letter from Colonel Dayton, dated\r\nthe 28th of July, at the German Flats. He informs me that he is to\r\ntake the command at Fort Stanwix.\r\n\r\nShould there be any thing to be had in New-York in the clothing way,\r\nshould be glad if you will lay some aside, no matter what--either\r\nsmall-clothes, shirts, stockings, or any thing of the kind. My best\r\ncompliments to General Putnam. If you will let Robert or Sawyer have\r\nthe perusal of this, they would learn the news of this army. Paper is\r\nso scarce, that one letter must serve both, unless something\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nMATT. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Major-general Greene had the command on Long Island, but\r\nhis health was so bad that it became necessary for him to resign it.\r\nThe commander-in-chief ordered General Putnam to assume the command.\r\nMajor Burr was his aid-de-camp. The landing of the British had been\r\npreviously effected on the 22d of August, 1776, without opposition,\r\nnear Utrecht and Gravesend, on the southwest end of the island. The\r\nAmerican troops, less than 12,000, were encamped on the north of\r\nBrooklyn heights. The British force, including Hessians, was more than\r\n20,000 strong. The armies were separated by a range of hills, at that\r\ntime covered with wood, called the Heights of Gowannus. Major Burr\r\nimmediately commenced an inspection of the troops, and made to the\r\ngeneral a most unfavourable report, both as to their means of defence\r\nand their discipline. The major proposed, however, several enterprises\r\nfor beating up the quarters of the enemy. To all which General Putnam\r\nreplied, that his orders were not to make any attack, but to act on\r\nthe defensive only.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th the action was fought. The loss of the Americans, in\r\nkilled, wounded, and prisoners, was about 1000. That of the British,\r\nless than 350. The Americans were driven within the works which they\r\nhad thrown up. Major Burr, previous to the action, had expressed to\r\nGeneral Putnam the opinion that a battle ought not to be risked; and\r\nthat much was to be gained by placing the troops in a position where\r\nthe navy of the enemy would not be so serviceable to them.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, the British advanced in column to within 500 or 600 yards\r\nof the American works. General Robinson, who commanded a portion of\r\nthe enemy, represents, in his parliamentary examination, that they\r\napproached much nearer. The American troops were formed in line to\r\nreceive them; but gave such indications of alarm, that Major Burr rode\r\nto General Putnam, and informed him that he had no hope the men would\r\nstand more than a single fire before they retreated. No attack,\r\nhowever, was made. Burr continued to urge upon General Putnam and\r\nMifflin (the latter of whom came over on that day from New-York) the\r\nnecessity of a retreat. During the night of the 28th, General Mifflin\r\nwent the rounds, and observed the forwardness of the enemy's\r\nbatteries, and, on the morning of the 29th, pressed upon General\r\nWashington an immediate retreat. A council was held, and the opinion\r\nof Mifflin unanimously adopted. The embarcation of the troops was\r\ncommitted to General McDOUGALL. He was at Brooklyn Ferry by eight\r\no'clock. In the early part of the night, the weather was very\r\nunfavourable; but about eleven o'clock every thing was propitious. A\r\nthick fog ensued, and continued until the whole army, 9000 in number,\r\nwith all the field artillery, ordnance, &c., were safely landed in\r\nNew-York. Major Burr was at Brooklyn. Here General McDOUGALL had an\r\nopportunity of noticing his efficiency. His reputation for talents and\r\nintrepidity had previously reached the ears of the general. From this\r\nnight, the 29th of August, 1776, until Major Burr retired from the\r\narmy, he possessed the entire confidence and esteem of General\r\nMcDOUGALL. Subsequent events, as will hereafter appear, tended to\r\nstrengthen and confirm the correctness of those prepossessions, thus\r\nformed in the hour of peril, and in the midst of the most appalling\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nThe situation of General Washington, after retreating from Long\r\nIsland, was very distressing. The defeat which the Americans had\r\nexperienced produced consternation and alarm in the ranks of a raw,\r\ninexperienced, and undisciplined army. In addition to other\r\ndiscouraging circumstances, within a few days after the retreat,\r\nnearly one fourth of the troops were on the sick-list. Colonel Glover\r\nsays that the commander-in-chief divided his army, posting 12,000 at\r\nKingsbridge, 6500 at Harlem, and 4500 in the city of New-York.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 15th of September, 1776, General Howe, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the British forces, landed on Manhattan\r\n(New-York) Island. General Washington had previously made the\r\nnecessary arrangements, and given orders for the troops to evacuate\r\nthe city and retire to Harlem, distant about seven miles. The descent\r\nof the British created an alarm in the American ranks, and produced no\r\ninconsiderable degree of confusion in the retreat. By some\r\nunaccountable mismanagement, General Silliman's brigade was left in\r\nNew-York, and conducted by General Knox to a small fort then in the\r\nsuburbs, and known as Bunker's Hill. Major Burr having been\r\ndespatched, at his own request, with a few dragoons, by General\r\nPutnam, to pick up the stragglers, discovered the error which had been\r\ncommitted, and galloping up to the fort, inquired who commanded.\r\nGeneral Knox presented himself. Major Burr desired him to retreat\r\nimmediately, or the whole brigade would be cut off and sacrificed.\r\nGeneral Knox replied, that a retreat, thus in the face of the enemy,\r\nwas impracticable, and that he intended to defend the fort. Burr\r\nremarked, that it was not bomb-proof; that it was destitute of water;\r\nand that he could take it with a single howitzer; and then, addressing\r\nhimself to the men, said, that if they remained there, one half of\r\nthem would be killed or wounded, and the other half hung, like dogs,\r\nbefore night; but, if they would place themselves under his command,\r\nhe would conduct them in safety to Harlem. Burr's character for\r\nintrepidity and military skill was already so well established, that\r\nthey determined to follow him. In the retreat they had some\r\nskirmishing, but met with very little loss in effecting their union\r\nwith the main body of the army. The following documents, furnished by\r\nofficers in Silliman's brigade, contain the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ROWLAND TO COMMODORE RICHARD V. MORRIS. Fairfield, (Conn.),\r\n\r\n29th January, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn answer to the inquiries relating to the evacuation of New-York, in\r\n1776, I can only observe, but few persons who were present, and\r\neyewitnesses of the event, are now living in this part of the country.\r\nI find, however, the Rev. Doctor Ripley, a gentleman of eminent\r\nrespectability, and Messrs. Wakeman and Jennings, respectable citizens\r\nof this town, now living, who belonged to the brigade of the late\r\nGeneral Silliman, the information of which gentlemen on any subject\r\ncan be relied on, and will be no otherwise than correct, however\r\nprejudice or other cause might occasion a reluctance in disclosing the\r\ninformation in their power to give; yet duty impelled their narrative,\r\nand the neglecting an opportunity to give evidence of noble acts and\r\nunrewarded worth they consider _ingratitude_. In preference to\r\ncommunicating to you by way of letter concerning transactions of so\r\nlong standing as the year 1776, I desired the enclosed certificates,\r\nwhich the gentlemen freely gave, in order to prevent any\r\nmisconstruction by passing through a second hand, by which you will\r\nhave more correct information than possibly in my power to give.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully yours, &c.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ROWLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Certificate of the Rev. Hezekiah Ripley_.\r\n\r\nOn being inquired of by Samuel Rowland, Esq., of Fairfield town and\r\ncounty, in the State of Connecticut, relative to my knowledge and\r\nrecollection respecting the merits of Colonel Aaron Burr as an officer\r\nand soldier in the late revolutionary war between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, can certify as follows:--\r\n\r\nHezekiah Ripley, of said Fairfield, doth certify, that on or about the\r\nfifteenth day of September, 1776, I was the officiating chaplain of\r\nthe brigade then commanded by Gen. Gold S. Silliman. From\r\nmismanagement of the commanding officer, that brigade was\r\nunfortunately left in the city of New-York, and at the time before\r\nmentioned. While the brigade was in front, and myself considerably in\r\nthe rear, I was met by the late General Putnam, deceased, who then\r\ninformed me of the landing of the enemy above us, and that I must make\r\nmy escape on the west side of the island. Whereupon I on foot crossed\r\nthe lots to the west side of the island, unmolested excepting by the\r\nfire from the ships of the British, which at that time lay in the\r\nNorth river. How the brigade escaped, I was not an eyewitness; but\r\nwell recollect, from the information I then had from General Chandler\r\n(now deceased), then acting as a colonel in said brigade, that Mr.\r\nBurr's exertions, bravery, and good conduct, was the principal means\r\nof saving the whole of that brigade from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy, and whose conduct was then by all considered judicious and\r\nmeritorious.\r\n\r\nBut, however, I well recollect, before I had the information alluded\r\nto from General Chandler, I had seen Mr. Burr, and inquired of him how\r\nthe brigade had made their escape, who then told me the particulars,\r\nwhich were afterwards confirmed by all the officers; who were all of\r\nopinion that, had it not been for him, they would not have effected\r\ntheir retreat and escape.\r\n\r\nAs to my own opinion of the management of the troops on leaving\r\nNew-York, I then, and still suppose, as did General Chandler, that\r\nColonel Burr's merits there as a young officer ought, and did, claim\r\nmuch attention, and whose official duties as an aid-de-camp on that\r\nmemorable day justly claimed the thanks of the army and his country.\r\n\r\nHEZEKIAH RIPLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Certificate from Isaac Jennings and Andrew Wakeman_. Being requested\r\nby Samuel Rowland, Esq., to give information relative to the\r\nevacuation of New-York, in the year 1776, by the American army, we,\r\nthe subscribers, then acting, one in the capacity of a lieutenant, and\r\nthe other as a private, in the brigade commanded by the late General\r\nSilliman, now deceased, do certify, That on the fifteenth day of\r\nSeptember (being on the Lord's day), the British landed on the east\r\nside of the island, about four miles above the city. The American\r\ntroops retreated the same day to Harlem heights. By some\r\nmisapprehension of the orders, or from other causes unknown to us, our\r\nbrigade was left, and was taken by General Knox to Bunker's Hill, [1]\r\na small fort (so called) about a mile from town. The fort was scarcely\r\nable to hold us all. We had but just got into the fort, when Aaron\r\nBurr, then aid-de-camp to General Putnam, rode up and inquired who\r\ncommanded there. General Knox presented himself, and Burr (then called\r\nMajor Burr) asked the general what he did there? And why he did not\r\nretreat with the army? The general replied, that it was impossible to\r\nretreat, as the enemy were across the island, and that he meant to\r\ndefend that fort. Major Burr ridiculed the idea of defending the\r\nplace, being, as he said, without provisions, or water, or bomb-proof;\r\nand that, with one mortar, or one howitzer, the enemy would take the\r\nplace in four hours, or in some very short time, and again urged\r\nGeneral Knox to retreat to Harlem heights; but General Knox said it\r\nwould be madness to attempt it. A smart debate ensued, the general\r\nadhering to his opinion. Burr addressed himself to the men, and told\r\nthem that, if they remained there, they would before night be all\r\nprisoners, and crammed into a dungeon, or hung like dogs. He engaged\r\nto lead them off, and observed that it would be better that one half\r\nshould be killed in fighting, than all be sacrificed in that cowardly\r\nmanner. The men agreed to follow him, and he led them out; he and his\r\ntwo attendants riding on the right flank. About four miles from town\r\nwe were fired upon by a party of the enemy. Burr galloped directly to\r\nthe spot the firing came from, hallooing to the men to follow him. It\r\nproved to be only a guard of about a company of the enemy, who\r\nimmediately fled. Burr and his horsemen pursued and killed several of\r\nthem. While he was thus employed, the head of a column had taken a\r\nwrong road. Burr came up and hurried us to the left, into a wood, and\r\nrode along the column from front to rear, encouraging the men, and led\r\nus out to the main army with very small loss.\r\n\r\nThe coolness, deliberation, and valour displayed by Major Burr in\r\neffecting a safe retreat, without material loss, and his meritorious\r\nservices to the army on that day, rendered him an object of peculiar\r\nrespect from the troops, and the particular notice of the officers.\r\n\r\nISAAC JENNINGS.\r\n\r\nANDREW WAKEMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM NATHANIEL JUDSON TO COMMODORE R. V. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 10th February, 1814.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, with the preceding statement, respecting\r\nour retreat from New-York Island, in September, 1776, and, in\r\ncompliance with your request, I have to reply, that the relation made\r\nby Mr. Wakeman and Mr, Jennings corresponds with my recollection. I\r\nwas near Colonel Burr when he lead the dispute with General Knox, who\r\nsaid it was madness to think of retreating, as we should meet the\r\nwhole British army. Colonel Burr did not address himself to the men,\r\nbut to the officers, who had most of them gathered around to hear what\r\npassed, as we considered ourselves as lost. But Colonel Burr seemed so\r\nconfident that he could make good a retreat, and made it clear that we\r\nwere all lost if we stayed there, that we all agreed to trust to his\r\nconduct and courage, though it did appear to us a most desperate\r\nundertaking; and he did not disappoint us, for he effected a retreat\r\nwith the whole brigade; and I do not think we lost more than thirty\r\nmen. We had several brushes with small parties of the enemy. Colonel\r\nBurr was foremost and most active where there was danger, and his\r\nconduct, without considering his extreme youth, was afterwards a\r\nconstant subject of praise, and admiration, and gratitude. This affair\r\nwas much talked of in the army after the surrender of Fort Washington,\r\nin which a garrison of about 2500 men was left under circumstances\r\nvery similar to ours; this fort having no bomb-proof. That garrison\r\nsurrendered, as is well known, the very same day our army retreated;\r\nand of those 2500 men, not 500 survived the imprisonment they received\r\nfrom the British. I have, since then, heard it repeated hundreds of\r\ntimes by the officers and men of Silliman's brigade, that our fate\r\nwould have been the same had it not been for Colonel Burr. I was a\r\nsergeant-major in Chandler's regiment of Silliman's brigade at the\r\ntime of the retreat.\r\n\r\nI am your very obedient servant,\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL JUDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Adjacent to what is now Grand-street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as the 10th of August, Burr, in a letter to his uncle\r\nEdwards, [1] expressed apprehensions that the retreat of the American\r\narmy from Long Island might be cut off and then that the British\r\n\"would have their own fun.\" From that period until the retreat was\r\neffected, on the night of the 27th, he continued to entertain the same\r\nopinion as to the necessity of retreating. So, also, in relation to\r\nthe city of New-York. He thought no attempt should be made to hold it.\r\nSubsequent events proved his good sense and foresight, as well as his\r\nmilitary genius. The city was abandoned on the 15th of September. Ten\r\ndays after he writes to his aunt Edwards, in reply to a desponding\r\nletter he had received from her, his views of the recent movements of\r\nthe American army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. EDWARDS.\r\n\r\nKingsbridge, 26th September, 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AUNT,\r\n\r\nI fear, madam, you give yourself needless anxiety about the situation\r\nof public affairs. It has been always held a maxim that our island and\r\nseaport towns were at the discretion of the tyrant of Great Britain.\r\nReasons for the retreat from Long Island are well known. The\r\nevacuation of New-York was a _necessary consequence_. The manner of\r\nconducting these made present advantages but trifling to the enemy.\r\nThe loss to us is of still less importance; and, indeed, some happy\r\nconsequences resulting from the manoeuvres appear to me worthy of\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto opposed them with less than half their number, and\r\nexposed to all their advantages of shipping. Our force is now more\r\nunited, theirs more divided. Our present situation renders their navy\r\nof less service to them, and less formidable to us;--a circumstance of\r\nvast importance, and to which I attribute all that has heretofore\r\nappeared in their favour. Add to these, besides confirming our\r\ninternal union, the effect that every appearance of success on the\r\npart of the enemy has upon our leading men. It arouses them from the\r\nlethargy which began to prevail; convinces them that their measures\r\nare unequal to their grand designs; that the present is the important\r\nmoment, and that every nerve must now be exerted.\r\n\r\nThis is not altogether fanciful. It has been actually the case. More\r\neffectual measures than were ever before thought of are now taking for\r\nlevying a new army. A committee of Congress are on the spot with us to\r\nknow all our wants, and report them properly, that they may be\r\nspeedily provided for. I do not intend by this, my dear aunt, to\r\ndeceive you into an opinion that every thing is already entirely\r\nsecure; that we are now actually relieved from every degree of danger;\r\nbut to remove your apprehensions concerning the important events which\r\ndepend on our military exertions. I hope, madam, you will continue,\r\nwith your usual philosophy and resolution, prepared for the uncertain\r\nevents of war, not anticipating improbable calamities.\r\n\r\nVarious have been the reports concerning the barbarities committed by\r\nthe Hessians, most of them incredible and false. They are fonder of\r\nplunder than blood, and are more the engines than the authors of\r\ncruelty. But their behaviour has been in some instances savage, and\r\nmight excuse a fear, if reckoned among usual calamities; but these\r\nshould be viewed on a larger scale than that of common complaisance.\r\nIt should be remembered we are engaged in a civil war, and effecting\r\nthe most important revolution that ever took place. How little of the\r\nhorrors of either have we known! Fire or the sword have scarce left a\r\ntrace among us. We may be truly called a favoured people.\r\n\r\nI have been not so engaged as common for a short time past, and have\r\nliberty of remaining, for three or four days, about two miles from\r\ncamp, from whence I now write you, a little more at leisure; but I am\r\nnow within drumcall.\r\n\r\nYour nephew,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the abandonment of Manhattan Island by the American army, and\r\nsome fighting in Westchester, General Washington crossed the North\r\nriver with a part of the troops, and retreated through New-Jersey. The\r\nmovements of Lord Cornwallis left no doubt that the object of the\r\nBritish general was Philadelphia. He advanced rapidly from Brunswick\r\nupon Princeton, hoping, by forced marches, to get in the rear of the\r\nAmericans. On the 8th of December, 1776, Washington crossed the\r\nDelaware, secured the boats, and broke down the bridges. Great\r\napprehension and alarm for the safety of Philadelphia now existed.\r\nJudge Marshall, in his Life of Washington, says,\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of this state of things, the general advised that\r\nlines of defence should be drawn from the Schuylkill, about the\r\nheights of Springatsbury, eastward to the Delaware, and General Putnam\r\nwas ordered to superintend them.\" Major Burr was now actively engaged\r\nas the aid-de-camp of General Putnam, whose esteem and unbounded\r\nconfidence he continued to enjoy. He writes Colonel Ogden,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinceton, 7th March, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Matt.,\r\n\r\nI this evening received your letter of yesterday's date, by Stockton.\r\nI knew not how to direct to you, nor where to send for the horse, or\r\nshould have done it sooner. I do not perfectly recollect the one you\r\nmention, but should be glad of any on your recommendation. Both boots\r\nand a saddle I want much, and shall be obliged to you to procure them\r\nfor me;--good leather would suit me as well as boots ready made. I\r\nhave not had a pair worth sixpence since those I had at Elizabethtown.\r\n\r\nAs to \"expectations of promotion,\" I have not the least, either in the\r\nline or the staff. You need not express any surprise at it, as I have\r\nnever made any application, and, as you know me, you know I never\r\nshall. I should have been fond of a berth in a regiment, as we\r\nproposed when I last saw you. But, as I am at present happy in the\r\nesteem and entire confidence of my good old general, I shall be piqued\r\nat no neglect, unless particularly pointed, or where silence would be\r\nwant of spirit. 'Tis true, indeed, my former equals, and even\r\ninferiors in rank, have left me. Assurances from those in power I have\r\nhad unasked, and in abundance; but of these I shall never remind them.\r\nWe are not to judge of our own merit, and I am content to contribute\r\nmy mite in any station.\r\n\r\nI shall probably be at Morris within ten days, on public business.\r\nWrite me whether I may expect you there. With sincere love to Mrs.\r\nOgden,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1777, a new army was to be raised. For political\r\nreasons it was deemed expedient to select, where it could be done with\r\npropriety, for the colonels of regiments, gentlemen supposed to have\r\nan influence. Among those who were thus selected was Colonel Malcolm,\r\nformerly a merchant in the city of New-York. He was highly\r\nrespectable, and universally esteemed, but was not a military man. In\r\nJune, 1777, Burr was appointed lieutenant-colonel of his regiment; but\r\nhe did not receive official notice of the fact until the 26th of July.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1777, General Putnam's headquarters being then at\r\nPeekskill, he issued the following order:--\r\n\r\n_By the Honourable Major-general Putnam, To Major Aaron Burr,\r\nAid-de-camp_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nPursuant to orders received from his excellency General Washington,\r\nyou are forthwith to repair to Norwalk, Fairfield, and the places\r\nadjacent on the Sound, transmit me without delay the intelligence you\r\nshall from time to time receive of the movements of the enemy, or any\r\nof their fleets. Request of the committees, or select-men of the\r\ndifferent towns, that they will be very punctual in reporting to the\r\ncommanding officer at this post whatever may in any respect relate to\r\nthe movements of the army, as both their safety and the welfare of the\r\ncountry may be promoted by their diligence in this particular.\r\n\r\nOn your return, which will be through Litchfield, you will leave\r\norders for all detachments of any regiments of General Nixon's brigade\r\nto take the most direct route to Albany, provided they be farther than\r\nthirty miles from this place, as much will be saved, and fatigue\r\navoided by the observance of this.\r\n\r\nHaving settled a line of intelligence from the different towns on the\r\ncoast, and left the necessary directions for the detachments of\r\nBrigadier-general Nixon's brigade, you will return with all convenient\r\nspeed to this place.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at headquarters, Peekskill, 14th day of July,\r\n1777.\r\n\r\nISRAEL PUTNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the last order that Major Burr ever received as the\r\naid-de-camp of his \"good old general.\" On his return to camp he\r\nreceived, in the usual form, a letter from General Washington,\r\nannouncing to him his appointment as lieutenant-colonel in the\r\nContinental Army, to which he replied,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeekskill, 21st July, 1777.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI was this morning favoured with your excellency's letter of the 29th\r\nult., and my appointment to Colonel Malcolm's regiment. Am truly\r\nsensible of the honour done me, and shall be studious that my\r\ndeportment in that station be such as will ensure your future esteem.\r\nI am nevertheless, Sir, constrained to observe, that the late date of\r\nmy appointment subjects me to the command of many who were younger in\r\nthe service, and junior officers the last campaign.\r\n\r\nWith submission, and if there is no impropriety in requesting what so\r\nnearly concerns me, I would beg to know whether it was any misconduct\r\nin me, or any extraordinary merit or services in them, which entitled\r\nthe gentlemen lately put over me to that preference? Or, if a uniform\r\ndiligence and attention to duty has marked my conduct since the\r\nformation of the army, whether I may not expect to be restored to that\r\nrank of which I have been deprived, rather, I flatter myself, by\r\naccident than design? I would wish equally to avoid the character of\r\nturbulent or passive, and am unhappy to have troubled your excellency\r\nwith a matter which concerns only myself. But, as a decent regard to\r\nrank is both proper and necessary, I hope it will be excused in one\r\nwho regards his honour next to the welfare of his country.\r\n\r\nI am not yet acquainted with the state of the regiment or the prospect\r\nof filling it; but shall immediately repair to rendezvous and receive\r\nColonel Malcolm's directions.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, with great respect,\r\n\r\nYour excellency's obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Malcolm's regiment was at this time stationed at Ramapo, or\r\nthe Clove, in Orange county, New-York, whither Lieutenant-colonel Burr\r\nproceeded. On presenting himself, the colonel was greatly surprised.\r\nThe youthful appearance of Burr led him to apprehend that he would be\r\nwanting in judgment and discretion; but a very short acquaintance\r\nremoved these impressions. Malcolm retired with his family about\r\ntwenty miles distant, leaving Burr in command, kindly remarking--\"You\r\nshall have all the honour of disciplining and fighting the regiment,\r\nwhile I will be its father;\" and he kept his word, for it is believed\r\nthat he never commanded it in battle during the whole war, although it\r\nwas frequently engaged. This duty devolved upon Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1777, the British came out of the city of New-York, on\r\nthe west side of the Hudson river, about 2000 strong, for the purpose\r\nof plundering and devastating the adjacent country, and capturing the\r\npublic stores. Colonel Burr was with his regiment, distant about\r\nthirty miles, when he heard of the enemy, and yet he was in their\r\ncamp, and captured or destroyed their picket-guards before the next\r\nmorning. For two days and nights he never slept. His regular force did\r\nnot exceed three hundred men; but, by surprising the British\r\nsentinels, he struck consternation into their ranks, and they fled\r\nwith precipitation, leaving behind them their plunder and a part of\r\ntheir stores. The following letters afford ample details:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement of Judge George Gardner, dated Newburgh, 20th December,\r\n1813.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1777, the regiment called Malcolm's regiment lay at\r\nSuffren's, in the Clove, under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Burr.\r\nIntelligence having been received that the enemy were in Hackensack in\r\ngreat force, and advancing into the country, Colonel Burr immediately\r\nmarched with the effective men, except a guard to take care of the\r\ncamp. I understood that while we were on the march, an officer arrived\r\nexpress from Major-general Putnam, who commanded at Peekskill,\r\nrecommending or ordering Colonel Burr to retire with the public stores\r\nto the mountains: to which Colonel Burr replied, that he could not run\r\naway from an enemy whom he had not seen, mid that he would be\r\nanswerable for the public stores and for his men.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Paramus, a distance of sixteen miles, before sunset.\r\nThere were considerable bodies of militia, in great alarm and\r\ndisorder, and doing much mischief to the neighbouring farms. They\r\ncould give no intelligence of the enemy but from rumour. Supposed them\r\nto be within a few miles, and advancing.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr set some of the militia to repair the fences they had\r\ndestroyed, and arranged them as well as time would permit; and having\r\ntaken measures to secure the troops from surprise, and also for the\r\nprotection of the cornfields, he marched immediately, with about\r\nthirty of the most active of the regiment, and a few of the militia,\r\nto ascertain the position and numbers of the enemy. About ten o'clock\r\nat night, being three miles from Hackensack, we got certain\r\nintelligence that we were within a mile of the picket-guards of the\r\nenemy. Colonel Burr then led the men into a wood, and ordered them to\r\nsleep till he should awake them, of which we had great need, having\r\nmarched more than thirty miles since noon. Colonel Burr then went\r\nalone to discover the position of the enemy. He returned about half an\r\nhour before day and waked us, and told us that he was going to attack\r\nthe picket of the enemy. That we had only to follow him, and then\r\nforbid any man to speak or to fire, on pain of death. He led us\r\nbetween the sentinels in such a way that we were within a few yards of\r\nthe picket-guard before they suspected our approach. He then gave the\r\nword, and we rushed upon them before they had time to take their arms,\r\nand the greater part were killed. A few prisoners and some\r\naccoutrements were brought off without the loss of one man. Colonel\r\nBurr immediately sent off an express to Paramus, to order all the\r\ntroops to move, and to rally the country. Our little success had so\r\nencouraged the inhabitants, that they turned out with great alacrity,\r\nand put themselves under the command of Colonel Burr. But the enemy,\r\nprobably alarmed by these threatening appearances, retreated the next\r\nday, leaving behind them the greater part of the cattle and plunder\r\nwhich they had taken. Colonel Burr was prevented from pursuing, by\r\nperemptory orders, which were received the day following the action,\r\nto join, without delay, the main army, then in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI served in this regiment all the time it was under the command of\r\nColonel Burr, being about two years; after which he was called to take\r\na separate command in Westchester. During the whole time he never\r\npermitted corporal punishment to be inflicted in a single instance;\r\nyet no regiment in the army was under better discipline, and I doubt\r\nwhether it was equalled by any one.\r\n\r\nGEORGE GARDNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LIEUTENANT ROBERT HUNTER TO GABRIEL FURMAN,\r\n\r\nESQ., MEMBER OF ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 22d January, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have understood that an application will be made to the legislature\r\nby or on behalf of Colonel Burr, for remuneration for his military\r\nservices during our revolutionary war. Having had the happiness to\r\nserve under him for more than two years, and having retained an\r\nunbounded respect for his talents and character, you will pardon me\r\nfor asking your active support of any thing which may be moved in his\r\nfavour; for certainly, if any officer of the army deserved recompense,\r\nit is Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\nHe sacrificed his health, and underwent more fatigue and privations\r\nthan any other officer of whom I had any knowledge. If I thought it\r\ncould be useful to him or amusing to you, I would enter into details;\r\nbut the facts are of general notoriety, and his superiority as a\r\nmilitary man, as far as my knowledge extends, universally allowed.\r\n\r\nI will however detain you while I relate a single incident, because it\r\nwas the first of which I was a witness. I was attached as a cadet to\r\nColonel Malcolm's regiment, then stationed in the Clove, when Burr\r\njoined it as lieutenant-colonel, being in the summer of 1777. Malcolm,\r\nseeing that his presence was unnecessary while Burr was there, was\r\nwith his family about twenty miles distant. Early in September, we\r\nheard that the enemy were out in great force. Burr gave orders for the\r\nsecurity of the camp and of the public stores, and within one hour\r\nafter news was received, marched with the choice of the regiment to\r\nfind the enemy. At Paramus the militia were assembled in considerable\r\nforce, but in great disorder and terror. No one could tell the force\r\nor position of the enemy. Burr assumed the command, to which they\r\nsubmitted cheerfully, as he alone (though but a boy in appearance)\r\nseemed to know what he was about. He arranged and encouraged them as\r\nwell as time would permit, and, taking a few of the most hardy of the\r\nmen, continued his march towards the enemy. Two or three miles this\r\nside Hackensack, we learned that we were near the enemy's advanced\r\nguard. Burr chose a convenient place for the men to repose, and went\r\nhimself to examine the position of the enemy. A little before daylight\r\nhe returned, waked us, and ordered us to follow him. He led us\r\nsilently and undiscovered within a few paces of the British guard,\r\nwhich we took or killed. From the prisoners we learned that the enemy\r\nwere about two thousand strong. Without loss of time he sent expresses\r\nwith orders to the militia, and to call out the country; and I have no\r\ndoubt but he would, within forty-eight hours, have had an army capable\r\nof checking the progress of the enemy, and of preventing or impeding\r\ntheir retreat; but they retreated the day following, and with every\r\nmark of precipitation. During these two days and nights the colonel\r\ndid not lie down or take a minute's repose. Thus you perceive, my dear\r\nsir, that Burr, being more than thirty miles distant when he heard of\r\nthe enemy, was in their camp the same night. You will agree with me\r\nthat things are not done so nowadays.\r\n\r\nSimilar instances of activity and enterprise occurred in each of the\r\nfour campaigns he served, and very frequently, during the winter, he\r\ncommanded on the lines of Westchester. I repeat, that it will afford\r\nme pleasure to relate so much of these things as came to my own\r\nknowledge, if it would be of any use.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was never a month with the regiment after Burr joined it; so\r\nthat it was Burr who formed it, and it was a model for the whole army\r\nin discipline and order. He never, in a single instance, permitted any\r\ncorporal punishment.\r\n\r\nHis attention and care of the men were such as I never saw, nor any\r\nthing approaching to it, in any other officer, though I served under\r\nmany. It would be a disgrace to the country if such a man should be\r\ndenied a liberal compensation, when it is too well known that he\r\nstands in need of it.\r\n\r\nI shall consider myself as personally obliged by your exertions in his\r\nfavour, and hope your colleagues will add theirs to yours. Please to\r\nshow this letter to your colleagues, and to offer them my respects.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT HUNTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original order to join the main army in Pennsylvania, to which\r\nJudge Gardner refers in the preceding statement, is found among the\r\npapers of Colonel Burr, and is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 27th September, 1777.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have just received a letter from General Washington, dated\r\n_thirty-four miles up Schuylkill_, wherein he informs me that General\r\nHowe's army had found means to cross Schuylkill several miles below\r\nhis army; upon which he has ordered a further reenforcement from this\r\npost, of which corps you must join. You will therefore, upon the\r\nreceipt of this, prepare to join General Parsons's brigade, whom I\r\nhave ordered up from the White Plains. I shall endeavour to send some\r\nmilitia to guard the stores remaining in the Clove. Your baggage must\r\ngo with you.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your very humble servant,\r\n\r\nISRAEL PUTNAM, M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Colonel Burr had surprised and captured the British\r\nguard, he received various complimentary notes from officers of the\r\narmy requesting details. A short extract from one is given.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, 20th September, 1777.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI congratulate you upon the good fortune you met with in taking off\r\nthe enemy's picket. We have had various accounts about the manner in\r\nwhich you executed the plan. The particulars I should be glad to hear\r\nfrom yourself.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.\r\n\r\nT. YATES.\r\n\r\nTo Lieutenant-colonel A. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, with his accustomed promptitude, as soon as he received\r\nthe orders of Major-general Putnam, put his regiment in motion. On the\r\nsecond day of his march he received from General Varnum the following,\r\ndirected to Lieutenant-colonel Burr, on his march to Morristown.\r\n\r\nCakeat, October 1st, 1777.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI this moment received your favour of this date. The enemy have landed\r\nat Powler's Hook in great force. I am apprehensive they mean attacking\r\nFort Montgomery by the way of the Clove. I have sent my baggage and\r\nsome forces there. The enemy must be attended to. You will therefore\r\nhalt in the nearest place that is convenient upon the receipt of this.\r\nKeep a good look-out towards Newark, Elizabethtown, &c., or those\r\nplaces from whence they can march into Pumpton. Should you be in\r\ndanger of being interrupted there, throw your party across the river\r\nin Pumpton, and defend the bridge, if practicable. If not, make the\r\nbest retreat you can towards Morristown, &c. But by no means proceed\r\nunless necessity urges, derived from the present object. In every\r\nthing else pursue your best discretion.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\nI. VARNUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following note from General Conway tends to prove, that although\r\nBurr was only a lieutenant-colonel in 1777, yet that he was actually\r\nreceived and treated as the commandant of his regiment, from which he\r\nwas never absent. Colonel Malcolm, in general, was employed on other\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL CONWAY.\r\n\r\n29th October, 1777.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from Captain Kearsley respecting the\r\nsettlement of the rank of the captains and subalterns. I could not\r\ngive him an immediate answer, because I was then attending a\r\ncourt-martial. I wish this matter was settled as soon as possible to\r\nthe satisfaction of the officers of your regiment. The general\r\nofficers being employed in several courts-martial, which, along with\r\nthe camp-duty, will take up all their time, I think you had best apply\r\nto the adjutant-general. Know from him the manner in which the ranks\r\nof the Virginia and Pennsylvania officers have been settled, and\r\narrange accordingly, at least pro tempore, the rank of your gentlemen.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nT. CONWAY.\r\n\r\nThe regiment joined the army in November, 1777, at Whitemarsh, in\r\nPennsylvania, twenty miles from Philadelphia. Colonel Burr, in command\r\nof it, was stationed about half a mile in advance of the main body.\r\nAfter a few weeks, the army went into winter-quarters at Valley Forge.\r\nDuring the winter, Colonel Burr proposed to General Washington an\r\nexpedition against Staten Island. He stated to the commander-in-chief\r\nthat he was personally and well acquainted with many of the\r\ninhabitants in the vicinity of the island. That he believed they would\r\njoin him as volunteers; and that he only asked two hundred men of his\r\nown regiment as a nucleus. General Washington declined granting the\r\nrequest. But subsequently, an unsuccessful attempt was made under the\r\ncommand of Lord Stirling.\r\n\r\nWithin eight or ten miles of Valley Forge, there was a narrow and\r\nimportant pass, known as the Gulf. A strong body of militia were\r\nstationed to defend it. They were in the habit of exciting in the camp\r\nfalse alarms; and the main body, in consequence, was frequently put in\r\nmotion. When not put in motion, they were greatly disturbed,\r\nespecially at night. These alarms generally resulted from the want of\r\na rigid discipline. General McDOUGALL was at Valley Forge, and\r\nexceedingly annoyed. Of Burr, as a disciplinarian and a soldier, he\r\nentertained a high opinion; and recommended to Washington that he\r\nwithdraw from this detachment Burr's seniors, as officers, and give\r\nhim the command of the post, which was accordingly done. Colonel Burr\r\nimmediately commenced a rigid system of police, visiting every night,\r\nand at all hours of the night, the sentinels; changing their position,\r\n&c. During the day he kept the troops under a constant drill. The\r\nrigour of this service was not adapted to the habits of militia, who\r\nhad been accustomed to pass, in camp, a life of idleness, and to act\r\nas suited their individual whims and caprices. A portion of the most\r\nworthless became restless, and were determined to rid themselves of\r\nsuch a commander.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was notified of the contemplated mutiny, in which he\r\nwould probably fall a victim. He ordered the detachment to be formed\r\nthat night (it being a cold, bright moonlight), and secretly directed\r\nthat all their cartridges should be drawn, so that there should not be\r\na loaded musket on the ground. He provided himself with a good and\r\nwell-sharpened sabre. He knew all the principal mutineers. He marched\r\nalong the line, eying the men closely. When he came opposite to one of\r\nthe most daring of the ringleaders, the soldier advanced a step, and\r\nlevelled his musket at Colonel Burr, calling out--\"Now is your time,\r\nmy boys.\" Burr, being well prepared and in readiness, anticipating an\r\nassault, with a celerity for which he was remarkable, smote the arm of\r\nthe mutineer above the elbow, and nearly severed it from his body,\r\nordering him, at the same time, to take and keep his place in the\r\nline. In a few minutes the men were dismissed, and the arm of the\r\nmutineer was next day amputated. No more was heard of the mutiny; nor\r\nwere there afterwards, during Colonel Bun's command, any false alarms.\r\nThis soldier belonged to Wayne's brigade; and some of the officers\r\ntalked of having Colonel Burr arrested, and tried by a court-martial,\r\nfor the act; but the threat was never carried into execution.\r\n\r\nThat Colonel Burr joined the army at White Marsh, and was there in\r\ncommand of his regiment, the following application and order will\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\nNear White Marsh, Nov., 1777.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe papers and clothing of the companies which have lately joined\r\nMalcolm's regiment are at Bethlem. The papers are now wanted; and\r\nseveral of the officers cannot appear decent until they receive other\r\nclothes: for these reasons I would ask your indulgence for leave of\r\nabsence, for two subalterns, six days. Their presence is not\r\nparticularly necessary with their companies.\r\n\r\nRespectfully your ob't serv't,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nHon. General CONWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis application General Conway returns, with the following\r\nendorsement:--\r\n\r\nColonel Burr is master to send such officers as he thinks requisite,\r\nin order to procure the papers wanted, and the clothes for the use of\r\nthe regiment.\r\n\r\nT. CONWAY.\r\n\r\nWhile the army was at Valley Forge, in the winter of 1777-78, the\r\ndifficulties between General Washington and General Gates, and their\r\nrespective friends, became, in a great measure, matter of publicity.\r\nAt this period there were two parties among the officers. Washington\r\nhad his warm friends and supporters. Lee and Gates had theirs.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was of the latter. The merits of the question will not be\r\ndiscussed; and the subject will only be referred to so far as Burr is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1776, at the request of the commander-in-chief, Burr\r\njoined his military family for a short space of time, but soon became\r\ndissatisfied and retired. On the 29th of August, 1776, the American\r\narmy retreated from Long Island. This retreat Burr had pressed upon\r\nPutnam, Mifflin, and others. In his letter to T. Edwards, [2] dated\r\nthe 10th of August, nearly _three weeks_ before it took place, he\r\nsays: \"They (the British) are to come through the Sound, and thus\r\ninvest us by the North and East rivers. They are then to land on both\r\nsides of the island, join their forces, and draw a line across, _which\r\nwill hem us in, and totally cut off all communication, after which\r\nthey will have their own fun._\"\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the retreat, Burr was actively engaged aiding\r\nMcDOUGALL in the embarcation of the troops at Brooklyn; and, from a\r\npersonal knowledge of the localities of it and the adjacent places, he\r\nimagined that he had rendered some service. It has been shown that, by\r\nhis intrepidity and perseverance in the retreat from New-York, he\r\nrescued from impending danger the brigade of General Silliman. In\r\nneither of these cases was his conduct noticed by the\r\ncommander-in-chief, either in general orders or otherwise. Young,\r\nardent, ambitious, and of a fiery temperament, he thought that justice\r\nwas not done to his efforts, and construed these, with other minor\r\noccurrences about the same time, into acts of hostility towards him.\r\nIn September, 1776, therefore, his prejudices against General\r\nWashington became fixed and unchangeable; and to the latest hour of\r\nhis life he recurred to the retreat from Long Island, and from the\r\ncity of New-York, with acrimonious feelings towards the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Whatever may be said to the contrary, as early as\r\nthis period those prejudices were formed and confirmed. That General\r\nWashington placed no confidence in Burr, and that, for some reason, he\r\nwas exceedingly hostile towards him, is equally certain. Whether his\r\nhostility commenced at this period is matter of more uncertainty.\r\nEvents already noticed demonstrate that the general considered him an\r\nintrepid, efficient, and vigilant officer.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1777, Burr was the friend of Lee and Gates in opposition to\r\nGeneral Washington. In the beginning of January, 1778, it was reported\r\nto Burr that Lord Stirling had made some remarks respecting the manner\r\nin which the colonel had contributed to arrange the rank of his\r\n(Burr's) subaltern officers. Lord Stirling at this time commanded the\r\ndivision. It will be recollected that, a few weeks previous, Colonel\r\nBurr had proposed to the commander-in-chief an enterprise against\r\nStaten Island, which was rejected; but, immediately after, it was\r\nunsuccessfully attempted by Lord Stirling. The difficulty, therefore,\r\nin fact, between these gentlemen, grew out of the latter circumstance.\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1778, Burr addressed Lord Stirling, requesting\r\nan explanation, which was promptly given in the following note, and\r\nthus the matter terminated.\r\n\r\nCamp, January 8th, 1778.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe receipt of your letter of yesterday's date not a little surprised\r\nme, for I can assure you that I have never made use of a word in\r\ncensure of yourself, or of the court you mention. I some days ago\r\nordered a return to be brought in of the names and rank of the\r\nofficers of the division, independent of what the two courts were\r\ndoing, and desired Major Monroe [3] to direct the brigade-majors to\r\nmake them out as soon as possible: from this, I suppose, some mistake\r\nhas arose, which I will call upon Major Stagg to explain.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nSTIRLING.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-colonel BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n2. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n3. James Monroe, late president of the United States, then aid to Lord\r\nStirling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was a rigid disciplinarian, and in the performance of his\r\nduty made no difference between those officers who were his friends\r\nand those who were not; yet he never failed to adopt the most delicate\r\nand gentlemanly course, where, in his opinion, rigour became\r\nnecessary. There are many documents tending to establish this fact,\r\nsuch as the following:--\r\n\r\nCamp, April 10th, 1778.\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nIn my weekly returns, your lordship may have observed that Captain Tom\r\nhas been returned--_absent without leave_. As he had been long from\r\nthe regiment, and no reasons had been assigned to me for his\r\nextraordinary absence, I thought myself in duty bound to make such\r\nreport. Upon his return to camp, he has accounted for his conduct in a\r\nmanner more satisfactory than I feared he could.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to deal too severely with a valuable officer, and conscious\r\nof the impropriety of passing any seeming neglect in entire silence, I\r\nrefer him to your lordship as the proper judge of his conduct and\r\nexcuses.\r\n\r\nMy lord, you are acquainted with the character of Captain Tom. You\r\nhave often heard me mention him with respect. Should his absence\r\nappear, in any degree, to have arisen from inattention, I hope your\r\nlordship will treat it with all the delicacy which the conduct of a\r\nman of feeling and of spirit can desire.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be,\r\n\r\nYour lordship's most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL MALCOLM.\r\n\r\nYorktown, June 16th, 1778.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have just now met with Captain Kearsley, which enables me to let you\r\nknow that I am here, sent by General Gates to Congress on a variety of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nI have consented to do duty as adjutant-general to the northern army,\r\non conditions of holding my regiment, and that it should come to the\r\nnorthward. The first agreed to; the last according to events.\r\n\r\nNone of the sixteen additional regiments stand on the new\r\nestablishment. Of the strongest, if ours comes within that\r\ndescription, it will be one. _As General Washington writes General\r\nGates that he cannot conveniently spare you at this time_, I recommend\r\nyour sending three or four officers to the State of New-York on the\r\nrecruiting service. You know who will answer best, and who can be best\r\nspared; and to recruit for the regiment at large, I think I can\r\nprovide you with some men.\r\n\r\nAs I have not time either to pass through, come, or to write any other\r\nof the officers, do tell them how I am circumstanced, and offer them\r\nmy best respects. I am happy to hear that Major Pawling is better. I\r\nshall write from Peekskill very soon, and beg to hear from you.\r\n\r\nI ever am, very sincerely, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nW. MALCOLM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the preceding letter it appears that \"General Washington had\r\nwritten to General Gates that he could not conveniently spare Colonel\r\nBurr.\" The reason is obvious. It was at the very moment when Sir Henry\r\nClinton was about to evacuate Philadelphia, and to retreat through\r\nNew-Jersey. The commander-in-chief was unwilling at such a crisis to\r\npart with an efficient and gallant officer. On the 18th of June, Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, with his forces, left the city, proceeded to Gloucester\r\nPoint, three miles down the river, and crossed the Delaware into\r\nNew-Jersey. That day he marched as far as Haddonfield. The Americans\r\ncrossed the Delaware at Corriel's Ferry, and halted, after a\r\ndistressing march from heat and rain, within five miles of Princeton.\r\nDuring the preceding winter General Lee had been exchanged, and joined\r\nthe army at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's force was now estimated at between 9000 and 10,000, rank\r\nand file. The Americans at 10,600, exclusive of Maxwell's brigade,\r\nabout 1200, and about 1200 militia. On the 24th of June, 1778, the\r\ncommander-in-chief propounded to the general officers the question,\r\n\"Will it be advisable to hazard a general action?\" The answer was,\r\n\"Not advisable; but a detachment of 1500 to be immediately sent to\r\nact, as occasion may serve, on the enemy's left flank and rear, in\r\nconjunction with the other continental troops and militia already\r\nhanging about them, and the main body to preserve a relative position,\r\nto act as circumstances may require.\" Signed by Lee, Stirling, Greene,\r\nFayette, Steuben, Poor, Paterson, Woodford, Scott, Portail, Knox.\r\n\r\nFour days after, viz., the 28th of June, the battle of Monmouth was\r\nfought. It was on this occasion that General Washington ordered the\r\narrest of General Lee: 1stly, For disobedience of orders in not\r\nattacking the enemy on the 28th of June, agreeably to repeated\r\ninstructions; 2dly, For misbehaviour before the enemy on the same day,\r\nby making an unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat; 3dly, For\r\ndisrespect to the commander-in-chief, in two letters, dated the 20th\r\nof June. On the 12th of August the courtmartial, of which Lord\r\nStirling was president, found Lee guilty, and sentenced him to be\r\nsuspended from any command in the armies of the United States for the\r\nterm of twelve months. The history of the battle of Monmouth, with all\r\nthe consequences that followed, has long since been given to the world\r\nby the friends and the opponents of the respective parties. It is only\r\nnecessary to state here, that Colonel Burr, on that occasion, was\r\nranked among the supporters of Lee, and had himself real or imaginary\r\ncause of complaint against the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nIn this action Colonel Burr commanded a brigade in the division of\r\nLord Stirling, composed of his own regiment and some Pennsylvanians,\r\nunder the immediate command of Lieutenant-colonel Dummer. Gordon, in\r\nhis History of the American Revolution, says, \"The check the British\r\nreceived gave time to make a disposition of the left wing and second\r\nline of the main army in the wood, and on the eminence to which he had\r\nbeen directed and was retreating. On this were placed some batteries\r\nof cannon by Lord Stirling, who commanded the left wing, which played\r\nupon the British with great effect, and, _seconded by parties of\r\ninfantry detached to oppose them, effectually put a stop to their\r\nadvance_. The British, finding themselves warmly opposed in front,\r\nattempted to turn the American left flank, but were repulsed.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the action had become general, Burr discovered a\r\ndetachment of the enemy coming from the borders of a wood on the\r\nsouthward. He instantly put his brigade in motion for the purpose of\r\nchecking them. It was necessary to cross a morass, over which a bridge\r\nwas thrown. He ordered Lieutenant-colonel Dummer to advance with the\r\nPennsylvania detachment, and that he would bring up the rear with his\r\nown regiment. After a part of the brigade was over the bridge, Colonel\r\nBarber, aid to General Washington, rode up, and said that the orders\r\nof the commander-in-chief were that he should halt. Colonel Burr\r\nremonstrated. He said his men, in their present position, were exposed\r\nto the fire of the enemy, and that his whole brigade must now cross\r\nthe bridge before they could halt with any safety. Colonel Barber\r\nrepeated that the orders of General Washington were peremptory that he\r\nshould halt, which was accordingly done, and the brigade, in their\r\ndivided state, suffered severely. Lieutenant-colonel Dummer was\r\nkilled; Colonel Burr's horse was shot under him; and those who had\r\ncrossed the bridge were compelled to retreat.\r\n\r\nThe movements and the firing of the armies continued until dark. The\r\nAmericans remained on the battle-ground, with an intention of renewing\r\nthe attack in the morning. Burr's uniform practice was, when near an\r\nenemy, to be up at night, visiting his own pickets, and taking the\r\nnecessary precautions for avoiding a surprise. The night preceding the\r\naction Colonel Burr was thus engaged, as it was known that the British\r\nwould move at dawn of day, if not before, and General Washington had\r\ngiven orders to Lee, who was in the advance, to commence the attack as\r\nsoon as they did move. The weather was intensely hot. Notwithstanding\r\nthe fatigue which Colonel Burr had undergone during the night of the\r\n27th and the succeeding day, yet he remained up the night of the 28th\r\nalso. Sir Henry Clinton's troops were employed in removing their\r\nwounded, and then marched away in such silence, that, though General\r\nPoor lay near them, their retreat was effected without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nExhausted with fatigue, and worn out for the want of repose, on the\r\n29th, Colonel Burr lay down under the shade of some trees and fell\r\nasleep. When he awoke, he was exposed, and had been for some time, to\r\nthe rays of the sun. He found himself unable to walk without great\r\ndifficulty; and so severely was he afflicted, that he did not recover\r\nfrom its effects for some years afterwards. A stranger to complaints\r\nor murmurs when enduring pain, the real state of his health was\r\nunknown to even his brother officers. In this situation he was\r\nimmediately ordered by General Washington, through Lord Stirling, to\r\nrepair to Elizabethtown, on highly important and confidential\r\nbusiness. The great object of the commander-in-chief was to ascertain,\r\nas far as practicable, the future movements of the enemy, Sir Henry\r\nClinton having secured his retreat to the city of New-York. General\r\nWashington proceeded to New-Brunswick, at which place Lord Stirling\r\nwas attending as president of the court-martial for the trial of\r\nGeneral Lee. The following notes will explain the character of Burr's\r\nmission, and the confidence reposed in him by the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LORD STIRLING.\r\n\r\nBrunswick, July 4th, 1778.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have this moment received yours of yesterday's date. On showing it\r\nto General Washington, he approves of the progress of your inquiries,\r\nand desires they may be continued. But he particularly desires me to\r\n_send off this express to you_, to request that you will endeavour to\r\nget all the intelligence you possibly can from the city of New-York:\r\nWhat are the preparations of shipping for embarcation of foot or\r\nhorse?--what expeditions on hand?--whether up the North river,\r\nConnecticut, or West Indies? For this purpose you may send one, two,\r\nor three trusty persons over to the city, to get the reports, the\r\nnewspapers, and the truth, if they can. We are just going to exhibit a\r\ngrand champêtre and feu de joie, so must only say that\r\n\r\nI am sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nSTIRLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LORD STIRLING.\r\n\r\nBrunswick, July 6th, 1778,\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have your letter of yesterday's date. The court-martial, of which I\r\nam president, is adjourned to Morristown, which will oblige me to go\r\nthere to-morrow. I must therefore desire you will direct your letters,\r\nwith such intelligence as you may procure, to his excellency General\r\nWashington, who will be on the line of march with the army. In haste,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSTIRLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LORD STIRLING.\r\n\r\nBrunswick, July 6, 1778.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington desires me to state that he wishes you would employ\r\nthree, four, or more persons, to go to Bergen heights, Weehawk,\r\nHoebuck, or any other heights thereabout, convenient to observe the\r\nmotions of the enemy's shipping, and to give him the earliest\r\nintelligence thereof; whether up the river particularly. In short,\r\nevery thing possible that can be obtained.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nSTIRLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM TENCH TILGHMAN.\r\n\r\nNewark, July 8th, 1778.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nHis excellency desires me to inquire whether you have received any\r\ninformation of the enemy's movements, situation, or design? He will\r\nleave this place about 4 o'clock this afternoon, before which he will\r\nexpect to hear from you.\r\n\r\nI am, dear sir, your most obedient,\r\n\r\nTENCH TILGHMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving completed the business on which he had been despatched by the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Colonel Burr proceeded to join his regiment,\r\nalthough his health was very bad. In a few days he received the\r\nfollowing order:--\r\n\r\nCamp, near Croton Bridge, 19th July, 1778.\r\n\r\nColonel Malcolm's regiment is ordered to march at two o'clock\r\nto-morrow morning, to the fort at West Point, on Hudson river, with\r\nthe regiment commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Parker, which is to join\r\non the road near Croton bridge. The commander of the two regiments\r\nwill make all convenient despatch, marching ten miles a day, as water\r\nand ground will admit.\r\n\r\nThe Baron DE KALB.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1778, in consequence of Sir Henry Clinton having\r\narrived in New-York with his army, much excitement and some\r\napprehension existed in the upper part of the state respecting the\r\ntories. The legislature had previously adopted rigid measures on the\r\nsubject, and it became necessary that an intelligent and confidential\r\nmilitary officer should be designated to take charge of them. General\r\nWashington selected Colonel Burr for this purpose, The trust was one\r\nof a delicate character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ROBERT BENSON.\r\n\r\nCamp, White Plains, 2d August, 1778.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nBy an act of the legislature of the State of New-York, the\r\ncommissioners for detecting and defeating conspiracies, &c., were\r\ndirected to tender an oath of allegiance, in the said act prescribed,\r\nto certain persons, inhabitants of this state, who have affected to\r\nobserve, during the present war, a dangerous and equivocal neutrality;\r\nand on their refusal to take the same, that the said commissioners\r\nshould cause them to be conveyed within the enemy's lines. In\r\nconsequence whereof, sundry persons, to whom the said oath hath been\r\ntendered, and who have refused to take the same, were by the\r\ncommissioners directed to rendezvous at Fishkill, on Monday next, in\r\norder to embark on board a sloop to be provided at that place for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn order that this business might be conducted with as little danger\r\nas possible to the operations of the present campaign, his excellency\r\nGovernor Clinton requested his excellency the commander-in-chief to\r\nappoint an officer of the army for the purpose; and you being assigned\r\nto this business, his excellency Governor Clinton hath directed me, in\r\nhis name, to request you to repair to Fishkill on Monday next, &c.\r\n\r\nIf by any accident you should not find the commissioners at Fishkill,\r\nhis excellency will be much obliged to you if you would ride up to\r\nPoughkeepsie, where the board are sitting.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nROBERT BENSON, Secretary.\r\n\r\nP.

This gentleman has, by long acquaintance,\r\nmanifested such qualities as have much attached me to his interest;\r\nbut, most unfortunately for his friends, has differed in political\r\nopinions from the body of the community in general, and from me in\r\nparticular, in consequence of which difference (by means of the test\r\nact of this state) he is about to be removed to the city of New-York;\r\nand has been so obliging as to offer me his assistance in procuring\r\nfor, and sending to me, a few family necessaries. Should it be in your\r\npower, I am very certain it would be an unnecessary request to desire\r\nyou to lend me any assistance: nor need I desire you to render Mr. Van\r\nSchaack's short stay among you as agreeable as his and your\r\ncircumstances will permit.\r\n\r\nI most sincerely congratulate you on the happy prospect of a speedy\r\ntermination to the war. I believe I shall visit the camp soon, in\r\nwhich case you will have the pleasure to see Mr. Edwards in company. I\r\nhave, since I saw you, become the father of a second daughter. Pamela\r\nhas had a most tedious and dangerous illness, but is, thank God, now,\r\nfor her, very well.

A short note from Lee to Burr will show the\r\npoignancy of the general's feelings under the sentence of the\r\ncourt-martial, and the mortification and disappointment he experienced\r\nwhen Congress refused to reverse that sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL LEE.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1778.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAs you are so kind as to interest yourself so warmly in my favour, I\r\ncannot resist the temptation of writing you a few lines. Till these\r\ntwo days, I was convinced the Congress would unanimously have\r\nrescinded the absurd, shameful sentence of the court-martial; but,\r\nwithin these two days, I am taught to think that equity is to be put\r\nout of the question, and the decision of the affair to be put entirely\r\non the strength of party; and, for my own part, I do not see how it is\r\npossible, if the least decency or regard for national dignity has\r\nplace, that it can be called a party business.\r\n\r\nI wish I could send you the trial, and will the moment I can obtain\r\none. I think myself, and I dare say you will think on the perusal,\r\nthat the affair redounds more to my honour, and the disgrace of my\r\npersecutors, than, in the warmth of indignation, either I or my\r\naid-de-camps have represented it. As I have no idea that a proper\r\nreparation will be made to my injured reputation, it is my intent,\r\nwhether the sentence is reversed or not reversed, to resign my\r\ncommission, retire to Virginia, and learn to hoe tobacco, which I find\r\nis the best school to form a consummate _general_. This is a discovery\r\nI have lately made. Adieu. Dear sir, believe me to be your most\r\n\r\nSincerely obliged servant,\r\n\r\nC. LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Monmouth, in June, 1778, Colonel Burr was\r\nconstantly employed. His health, from the fatigues of that and the\r\nsubsequent day, was greatly impaired. Early in October, he found\r\nhimself, in a measure, unfit for active service. He left West Point,\r\nwhere his regiment was stationed, and repaired to Elizabethtown, in\r\nthe hope that a few weeks of repose might prove beneficial; but in\r\nthese hopes he was sorely disappointed. He then determined to ask a\r\nfurlough, and retire from the army for a few months, provided the\r\nfurlough was granted without his receiving pay. On this point he was\r\nvery fastidious. By these feelings he was uniformly governed through a\r\nlong life. He never sought nor accepted an office for the emolument it\r\nafforded. He wrote the commander-in-chief on the subject, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nElizabethtown, 24th October, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe excessive heat and occasional fatigues of the preceding campaign,\r\nhave so impaired my health and constitution as to render me incapable\r\nof immediate service. I have, for three months past, taken every\r\nadvisable step for my recovery, but have the mortification to find,\r\nupon my return to duty, a return of sickness, and that every relapse\r\nis more dangerous than the former. I have consulted several\r\nphysicians; they all assure me that a few months retirement and\r\nattention to my health are the only probable means to restore it. A\r\nconviction of this truth, and of my present inability to discharge the\r\nduties of my office, induce me to beg your excellency's permission to\r\nretire from pay and duty till my health will permit, and the nature of\r\nservice shall more particularly require my attention, provided such\r\npermission can be given without subjecting me to any disadvantage in\r\npoint of my present rank and command, or any I might acquire during\r\nthe interval of my absence.\r\n\r\nI shall still feel and hold myself liable to be called into service at\r\nyour excellency's pleasure, precisely as if in full pay, and barely on\r\nfurlough; reserving to myself only the privilege of judging of the\r\nsufficiency of my health during the present appearance of inactivity.\r\nMy anxiety to be out of pay arises in no measure from intention or\r\nwish to avoid any requisite service. But too great a regard to\r\nmalicious surmises, and a delicacy perhaps censurable, might otherwise\r\nhurry me unnecessarily into service, to the prejudice of my health,\r\nand without any advantage to the public, as I have had the misfortune\r\nalready to experience.\r\n\r\nI am encouraged in this proposal by the opinion Lord Stirling has been\r\npleased to express of the justice of my request;--the sense your\r\nexcellency must entertain of the weak state of the corps in which I\r\nhave the honour to command, and the present sufficiency of its\r\nrespective officers. I purpose keeping my quarters at this place until\r\nI have the honour of your excellency's answer, which I wait with\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect,\r\n\r\nYour humble servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Fredericksburgh, 26th October, 1778.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have your favour of the 24th. You, in my opinion, carry your ideas\r\nof delicacy too far when you propose to drop your pay while the\r\nrecovery of your health necessarily requires your absence from the\r\nservice. It is not customary, and it would be unjust. You therefore\r\nhave leave to retire until your health is so far re-established as to\r\nenable you to do your duty. Be pleased to give the colonel notice of\r\nthis, that he may know where to call upon you should any unforeseen\r\nexigency require it.\r\n\r\nI am your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nG. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of the above letter, Colonel Burr repaired to West\r\nPoint and joined his regiment, notwithstanding the shattered state of\r\nhis constitution. He was unwilling to absent himself from the service,\r\nand at the same time receive pay. Colonel Burr was now in his\r\ntwenty-third year, and yet so youthful was his appearance, that\r\nstrangers, on a first introduction, viewed him as a mere boy. As\r\nevidence of the fact, he has often related with great good-humour this\r\nanecdote. While he was commanding at West Point, a countryman had some\r\nbusiness to transact with him. He requested admittance to Colonel\r\nBurr. The orderly sergeant conducted him into headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the countryman, \"I wish to see Colonel Burr, as I have\r\nsomething to say to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may proceed. I am Colonel Burr.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" rejoined the honest farmer, \"you are Colonel Burr's son.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentinel at the door heard and repeated the conversation, and Burr\r\nwas often afterwards designated as Colonel Burr's son. He remained at\r\nWest Point until December, when he was removed to Haverstraw by the\r\norders of General McDOUGALL, and had the command of a brigade,\r\nconsisting of Malcolm's regiment, and a portion of Spencer's and\r\nPatten's regiments. He was subsequently ordered to take command on the\r\nlines in Westchester county, a most important and not less perilous\r\npost. In December, he received from Mrs. J. Montgomery, the widow of\r\nGeneral Montgomery, a letter, as follows :--\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\nRhinebeck, December 25th, 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty to enclose a list of things Mr. Smith was so kind\r\nas to send me from New-York by the return flag. The captain of the\r\nflag, of whom I made some inquiries, professed to know nothing of\r\nthem, and referred me to Colonel Burr, who might know something of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI am almost ashamed to take up your attention about so small an\r\naffair; but the difficulty that attends obtaining the least article of\r\ndress, must, I think, plead my apology. Besides, having this\r\nopportunity, I would wish to assure Colonel Burr of the very great\r\nrespect I have for those gentlemen whom General Montgomery professed\r\nto esteem; among which, sir, I am told you was not the least. To be by\r\nhim distinguished argues a superior merit, and will ensure you a most\r\nsincere welcome at Rhinebeck should it lie in your way.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with esteem, yours, &c.\r\n\r\nJ. MONTGOMERY\r\n\r\nCOLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn taking command of the lines in Westchester, Colonel Burr received\r\nfrom brother officers congratulatory letters, so distinguished was the\r\nstation considered. Colonel Udney Hay, under date of the 29th of\r\nJanuary, 1779, says, \"As you have now got the post of honour, accept\r\nof my sincere wishes that you may reap the laurels I believe you\r\ndeserve.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Burr arrived at the camp, he commenced a system of reform\r\nand discipline. Previous to his arrival, there was exhibited a most\r\ndisgraceful scene of plunder, and sometimes of murder, along the whole\r\nfrontier. This he promptly checked; and, in all his efforts to\r\naccomplish this end, he was sustained by General McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nCamp, White Plains, 12th January, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed return will show you the deficiency of officers and men\r\nat this post. Above the complement for the parties, I wish to have a\r\nguard for myself, and a commissary's guard. To detail men for these\r\npurposes will interfere with the rotation of duty.\r\n\r\nI arrived here on Friday evening. The weather on Saturday was too\r\nsevere and stormy to permit me to make myself acquainted with the post\r\nand disposition of the troops. I improved yesterday for those\r\npurposes, and found it necessary to alter the position. I have moved\r\nthe left three miles forward, and the two centre divisions so as to\r\nallign with that and Tarrytown. The posts now possessed by these\r\ndetachments are,\r\n\r\n_First._ Tarrytown.\r\n\r\n_Second._ Isaac Reed's and John Hammond's, near Sawmill river.\r\n\r\n_Third._ Starr's and Moses Miller's, one and a half miles in front of\r\nYoung's.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ Merritt's and neighbouring houses, near Farmer Oakley's.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement the extent of my command is contracted three\r\nmiles, and the distance from my left to the Sound is three miles less\r\nthan before. The men more compact, and the posts equidistant from the\r\nenemy. While I was upon the business above mentioned, Colonel\r\nLittlefield and Mr. Thomas visited Colonel Enos and Lieutenant-colonel\r\nHoldridge, to enforce the necessity of an immediate junction, to\r\ncomplete the security of the country upon the present plan; but these\r\ngentlemen say they have no orders to cross Biram river. They have\r\ntheir quarters in Horseneck, and some troops are north of that place.\r\nThus, notwithstanding my endeavours, the country will be unprotected,\r\nand I am insecure.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the arrest of a Captain Brown. I am sorry for the\r\nnecessity of any thing which may have the appearance of severity; but\r\nthe avowal of behaviour so very unbecoming constrained me to it. The\r\nrequired parties of militia will, I believe, join me this week. I\r\nshall write you about iron-bound casks in a few days. There is not a\r\nhide, the property of the country, in all this quarter, except\r\nfourteen in the hands of the commissary of hides. I shall, as soon as\r\npossible, make myself acquainted with the officers of the militia. I\r\nhave sent to Bedford, but have no answer, about rum, &c.\r\n\r\nI send the names of a few of Malcolm's officers, whom I would wish\r\nwere ordered to join me immediately. Some of them, I believe, are\r\nabsent. Lieutenant-colonel Littlefield had it in intention to go with\r\nmost of the men this evening on an expedition to West Farms and\r\nMorrisania. Abstracted from your verbal instructions, the plan\r\nappeared to me premature. The men here are not half officered; the\r\ncountry by no means sufficiently reconnoitred; the force very\r\ninadequate, even for covering parties. As there was a prospect that\r\neach of the inconveniences would shortly be removed, I advised to\r\ndefer it. To convince them that my disapprobation arose from no\r\njealousy of honour, I told Colonel Littlefield that if the enterprise\r\nshould hereafter be thought more advisable, I would leave to him the\r\nexecution: if I should think proper to send him on that command, I\r\nwould act with the covering party. One hundred and fifty continentals\r\nand fifty militia was the force proposed for this evening; but as\r\nthere are a number of volunteers on the spot, I consented to and\r\nencouraged an excursion to Frog's Neck, under Colonel Littlefield. I\r\nexpect little from it, but have not so much to fear.\r\n\r\nI hope Mr. Stagg succeeded in his application to Mr. Erskine. A\r\ndraught of the country would be of great service to me. In your\r\ninstructions about plunder, you direct that all the fat horses, &c. in\r\nthe hands of disaffected persons, \"lying certain courses,\" are to be\r\ntaken, on the supposition that they are designed for, or will fall\r\ninto the hands of, the enemy. As this mode of determining may be the\r\nsource of much altercation, I could wish, if you thought proper, the\r\nseizable property might be designated by a certain number of miles\r\nbelow our lines, or below the line intended to be formed from\r\nTarrytown, through White Plains, to Sawpits or Rye.\r\n\r\nThe two parties from Paterson's brigade will most of them want shoes\r\nin ten days. It is my opinion that a great part of those who came last\r\nwith new shoes, will not, at the expiration of the time, be able to\r\nreturn for the want of shoes. Those they now have are of the slightest\r\nFrench make; many already worn out. If these men must be again\r\nrelieved by others better shod, and they again in a few days, there\r\nwill be such an endless marching and countermarching as will harass\r\nthe troops, and wear out more shoes than all the duty performed here.\r\nWould not these evils be in some measure remedied by sending me a\r\nparcel of shoes? I will keep an exact account of the regiment they are\r\ndelivered to.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nWhite Plains, January 13th, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nAll the horsemen were so infatuated with the itch for scouting, that I\r\nhad not one to despatch with the letter herewith sent. Colonel\r\nLittlefield, with the party, returned this morning. They brought up\r\none prisoner. I shall send him up with another grand rascal to-morrow.\r\nThere are evidences enough against Merritt to hang a dozen such, but\r\nmany of them dare not appear at present.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the cautions I gave, and notwithstanding Colonel\r\nLittlefield's good intentions, I blush to tell you that the party\r\nreturned loaded with plunder. Sir, till now, I never wished for\r\narbitrary power. I could gibbet half a dozen _good whigs_, with all\r\nthe venom of an inveterate tory. The party had not been returned an\r\nhour, before I had six or seven persons from New-Rochelle and Frog's\r\nNeck, with piteous applications for stolen goods and horses. Some of\r\nthese persons are of the most friendly families. I am mortified that\r\nnot an officer on the ground has shown any activity to detect the\r\nplunderers or their spoil. I have got three horses, and a number of\r\nother articles, and have confined two soldiers who had them in\r\npossession. But these are petty rascals. I feel more pity than\r\nindignation towards them. They were honest men till debauched by this\r\nexpedition. I believe some officers are concerned. If I can be assured\r\nof that (and I shall spare no labour), you may depend on seeing them\r\nwith a file of men. The militia volunteers excelled in this business.\r\nIf I detect them I shall treat them with the same rigour, unless you\r\nadvise to the contrary. I wish you would give me directions. I have at\r\nleast a fortnight's work before me to undo the doings of last night.\r\n\r\nThis day I enter on my command. Truly an ominous commencement. Is this\r\nthe promised protection? I read in the face of every child I pass; for\r\nthe whole _honour_ of the expedition redounds to me. But enough of\r\nthis; more perhaps than you will thank me for. Webbers was of the\r\nparty, and can give you a history. I now perceive from whence arose\r\nthe ardour for scouting. I suppose the sergeants' parties of militia,\r\nwhen they join me, will be subject to courts of the line.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR PLATT, AID TO GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, January 14th, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe general has received yours, and directs me to inform you that such\r\nassistance will be granted as is necessary for the protection of the\r\ncountry and your honour.\r\n\r\nHe desires that no expedition be set on foot till you hear further\r\nfrom him. He has no objections to Colonel Littlefield's remaining with\r\nyou till the arrival of more officers.\r\n\r\nHandcuffs will be sent you as soon as they can be made. If you have a\r\nnumber of prisoners at any time to send up, let them be fastened right\r\nand left hands, and the guard cut the strings of their breeches, and\r\nthere will be no danger of their making their escape, as they will be\r\nobliged to hold them up continually with one hand.\r\n\r\nLast evening Josiah Fowler made his escape from the provost; possibly\r\nhe may fall into the hands of your scouts or patrols. If he does,\r\nplease to take the best care of him.\r\n\r\nThe general will write you fully by the captain who will soon\r\nre-enforce you. One hundred pair of shoes will be sent you. The map of\r\nthe country is herewith transmitted, for the purpose of taking a\r\nsketch of it. You will please to do it as soon as possible, and send\r\nit up by a careful hand. The general does not wish you ever to carry\r\nit from your quarters.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRICHARD PLATT, Aid-de-camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, January 15th, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour favours of the 11th and 12th, with their enclosures, came duly to\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI am much mortified that Captain Brown should have merited your\r\nputting him in an arrest. But you have done your duty, for which\r\naccept my thanks.\r\n\r\nIf an officer commanding an outpost will not be very vigilant, he\r\nexposes his party to be butchered, as the unfortunate Colonel Balor\r\nlately experienced.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry the militia have conducted so disorderly; but I wish\r\nyou to deal tenderly with them, as they are brave, and are very sore,\r\nby the plundering of the tories. But support the honour of our arms\r\nand your own, by giving redress to the innocent and defenceless.\r\n\r\nAs the principal objects of your command are to protect the good\r\npeople of these states, and prevent supplies going to the enemy, you\r\nwill not send out any parties, or make any excursions, but what are\r\nnecessary for intelligence, and the preservation of your parties, till\r\nfurther orders. Your own ideas on this subject fully meet my\r\napprobation. In the meantime, let all the officers and men of your\r\ncommand, who are unacquainted with the ground, traverse it\r\nalternately, from flank to flank, and as many miles in front as you\r\nmay judge necessary. The position of the whole I leave to your own\r\ndiscretion, as circumstances shall arise. A good captain, and twenty\r\npicked men, of Nixon's, with two drums, accompany this, to re-enforce\r\nyour left, and the orders are despatched to Major Pawling for the\r\nofficers you wrote for. One hundred pair of shoes_ will be sent to you\r\nby this snow.\r\n\r\nSend up all Burgoyne's men, with a good corporal and small party of\r\nthe nine-months men, with the first deserters or prisoners. The\r\nsergeants' parties of the militia who are to join you, will, by their\r\nengagements, be under the continental articles of war. If any of the\r\nmilitia who may go out on scouts or parties with yours will not submit\r\nto the articles of war and your orders, don't suffer them to go with\r\nthem, nor to appropriate any plunder; but order it to be given to the\r\ncontinental troops, and those who shall submit to those articles.\r\n\r\nIf any of the militia maraud, send them up to me, with a guard. They\r\nmust not be suffered to violate civil and military law. The\r\nlegislature is the proper authority to enable them to make reprisals.\r\nFor whatever disorders they commit in front of your lines, will be\r\nplaced by the enemy to your account.\r\n\r\nIn all doubtful questions which may arise on my orders as to the\r\nlimits or legality of plunder in your front, _I authorize you to be\r\nthe sole judge._ In the exercise of this trust, it is my wish you\r\nshould lean to the honour of our arms.\r\n\r\nA surgeon is directed to attend your party; when he arrives, please to\r\nadvise me of it, that I may be relieved from all anxiety about you and\r\nyour corps. If you are not supplied with rum before a quantity of it\r\narrives here, we shall not forget you. If your horsemen are mounted\r\nand appointed, as well as your horse-guides, they will receive the\r\nsame pay. If the oxen at Mr. Hunter's are not in working order, put\r\nthem in the care of your forage-master till they are.\r\n\r\nIf you can get the articles taken from the inhabitants in the late\r\nexpedition restored, let the militia off for that offence. When you\r\nget things in train, I flatter myself you will not have any fixture\r\ntrouble with them. But the officers of the regular troops must be\r\nrigorously dealt with, according to our martial law.\r\n\r\nAs you and the commissary will be in the rear of the whole, the\r\nnine-months men, worse shod than the other troops, may serve till I\r\nhave more leisure to complete your corps.\r\n\r\nDon't omit sending to me all the newspapers you can procure. I am so\r\nborne down with correspondence, that I can only add that\r\n\r\nI am your affectionate humble servant,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nP. S. I fear the pickets from your parties are too far advanced from\r\nthem. The distance ought not to exceed half a mile at night; and the\r\nquarters of the pickets should be changed every night after dark.\r\nFrequent patrols from each give the best security.\r\n\r\nI submit it to your consideration whether it would not be of service\r\nto have a quantity of old rags collected at each party and picket, for\r\nthe patrols to muffle their feet with in frosty weather when there is\r\nno snow on the ground. It will prevent their being heard by the enemy,\r\nand yours will hear those of the enemy if there are any near them.\r\n\r\nA. M'D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. There were two families of Van Schaicks in the State of New-York.\r\nThey spelled their names differently. The family of Colonel _Van\r\nSchaick_ were revolutionary whigs.

Benjamin Sands, jun. appears\r\nto be a man of good understanding. He can give you a detail of their\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nCaptain Black and three subalterns of Malcolm's regiment joined me\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nWilliam Burtis goes under guard to you to-morrow. Also a Garret\r\nDuyckman, whom I took upon information of Burtis. I knew of Burtis\r\nhaving drove cattle before the receipt of your letter. Of his being a\r\nspy I know nothing. Burtis wishes to procure favour by giving\r\ninformation. I enclose his confession to me, that you may compare it\r\nwith his story to you. He has not told me all he knows, I am\r\nconvinced. I can secure Elijah Purdy any time if you direct. There is\r\nno danger in delaying till I can hear from you. I wish to clear the\r\ncountry of these rascals. It would be of infinite service to hang a\r\nfew up in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe two parties from Nixon's brigade, which came under sergeant's last\r\nweek, are so distressed for clothes, that I am obliged to send them to\r\ntheir regiments. They came provided but for one week. Lieutenant\r\nWottles marches them up. I wish him to return with the re-enforcement.\r\nI have sent the corporal and sixty-nine men to Bedford. I have now\r\nabout 170 privates. A single company, and twelve from Hammond's\r\nregiment, join me to-day. That is his complement.\r\n\r\nA commissary of hides at this place can furnish me with shoes as I\r\nwant them, if you will give an order for that purpose. He delivers\r\nnone without a general order. I can purchase rum here at twenty\r\ndollars per gallon. There is no commissary of purchases.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of women here of bad character, who are continually\r\nrunning to New-York and back again. If they were men, I should flog\r\nthem without mercy.\r\n\r\nIt was the indolence of the commissary, and not the real scarcity of\r\nwheat, which alarmed me. I shall not trouble you again on the score of\r\nflour. I send you two papers by the sergeant.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n A. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, January 22, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThere are reasons, which I shall explain to you at a proper time, why\r\n----- should not be sought after. Make a great noise about him; abuse\r\nhim as the vilest of horse thieves, and a spy for the enemy; but send\r\nno parties after him. If you are told where he is, turn off the matter\r\nby some pretext or other. Don't carry this out on party, or out of\r\nyour quarters to any unsafe place.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MCDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th.\r\n\r\nI am at the Hermitage, my dear Burr, and cannot forbear writing you a\r\nfew lines, although I expected, before this time, to have been\r\nfavoured with a letter from you. Mrs. Prevost informs me that there is\r\nthe most flattering prospect of your soon being reinstated in your\r\nhealth. The intelligence gives me real pleasure, and the more so,\r\nbecause, until Mrs. Prevost told me, I had no idea of your disorder\r\nbeing so rooted and dangerous. May health soon revisit you, my good\r\nfriend; and when it does, may it continue with you for years. I am\r\npleased with the hope of seeing you in Jersey early in the spring. I\r\nshall be this way again in March, when perhaps I shall meet you at\r\nthis place. I write this standing in the midst of company. I am called\r\noff to court, and therefore, for this time, adieu.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR PLATT, AID TO GENERAL MCDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, January 26th, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nCaptain Wiley, of Learned's brigade, will hand you this. He brings\r\nwith him forty men, I believe as good as any in the army. 'Tis the\r\ngeneral's intention that Nixon's, Paterson's, and the late Learned's\r\nbrigades, shall each furnish a party of sixty. You will please, after\r\nselecting the best men for your parties, to order all the rest (save\r\nyour own and commissary's guard) to join their corps, as they complain\r\nthe duty is hard above. Either Captain Williams or Spur must leave\r\nyou, as Captain Wiley will command the party from Learned's. If there\r\nare three subs for each party exclusive of those from your own\r\nregiment, you can detain the whole of the subs of other brigades or\r\nnot, as you like.\r\n\r\nKearsley has not yet joined. The general will review all your letters\r\nin a day or two, and give them full answers.\r\n\r\nI am your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRICHARD PLATT, Aid-de-camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nWhite Plains, January 29th, 1779.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI had this day the favour of yours by Lieutenant Rost. The same\r\ngentleman brought me a re-enforcement of thirty-nine privates, and a\r\nproportion of officers. This enables me to send to camp a few of the\r\nworst provided of the nine-months men. The returning party takes up\r\nthe prisoners mentioned in my last, and a deserter. Two more of\r\nMalcolm's officers have joined me.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a letter from Colonel Holdridge. The\r\nenterprise appears to me something romantic; but I have acquainted\r\nColonel Holdridge of the steps I shall take should it prove serious,\r\nand have appointed a place near this to meet him, if he thinks it\r\nnecessary. The number, disposition, and apparent intentions of the\r\nenemy will point out our duty. I am this evening told, by good\r\nauthority, that Emerick is re-enforced, either by volunteer or\r\nenlisted refugees, to the amount of 4 or 500, and that there are\r\nstrong symptoms of an excursion. I shall pay due attention to these\r\nreports and authorities.\r\n\r\nThese two days past I have taken a particular view of the country and\r\nroads from White Plains to Mamaroneck, Rye, and Sawpits. I find it\r\nmuch easier protected, and more secure, than the western part of this\r\ncounty. From the Bronx to Mamaroneck river, through White Plains, is\r\nthree miles. There are very few fords or bridges on either of those\r\nrivers. Might it not be of service to draw a line, if but for a few\r\ndays, from Bronx to Rye, or Mamaroneck? The Purchase would be\r\ncertainly a ridiculous post.\r\n\r\nThe map is herewith sent. Lieutenant Chatburn, who has business at\r\nWest Point, will deliver this.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 6th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have devoted part of this night to review your letters, and to give\r\nthem some kind of answers. I can only mention ideas. I leave you to\r\ndilate them.\r\n\r\nThe bearer is one of the sentries who was partly the occasion of the\r\nlate misfortune. I have reproved them severely, which I hope will have\r\nthe desired effect. For the future, order the sentry who does not fire\r\nthe alarm one hundred lashes, and the like number to any who shall\r\npart with his arms without its being wrested from him by the enemy;\r\nand a reward of twenty dollars to any non-commissioned officer or\r\nsoldier who shall bring in such arms. Publish this in orders.\r\n\r\nI am fully sensible of your embarrassments and difficulties, for want\r\nof vigilant officers and discipline. Be it your honour to surmount\r\nthem. Accept of my thanks for your attention to the service. Order one\r\npound and a half of flour or bread, and the like quantity of meat, to\r\neach man, till the first of April. The duty is hard, and exercise\r\nincreases the appetite. Will it not advance the service to send you\r\ndown some biscuit? Give Commissary Leake no rest without vegetables.\r\nHis guard will be relieved by a militia one. How many sergeants'\r\nparties have you? Your guard and that of the commissary will be taken\r\nfrom the brigades, as 120 from Paterson's is to 60 from the others. In\r\nreturns, designate the strength from each brigade. The regiments whose\r\nmen have no bayonets, some means will be devised to furnish them.\r\nHeavy packs should not be at the stated quarters. Fix a day beforehand\r\nwhen you will hear the complaints of the disaffected. If any come on\r\nother days, give them thirty-nine lashes first; wait the effects of\r\nthis discipline.\r\n\r\nThe oath of allegiance is no criterion of characters, nor the want of\r\na certificate thereof an evidence of a person's being disaffected.\r\nUniform character is the best rule to judge. Send up under guard all\r\nwomen who stroll to New-York without leave. But cause them to be well\r\nsearched by matrons for papers _immediately_ when they are taken;\r\nhair, caps, stays, and its lining, should be well examined. Do the\r\nlike to those going down. Send up the evidences against Bettice. I\r\napprove your manner of treating Captain Williams. I did not yet intend\r\nthe hard money taken by him should be distributed. But, if it is done,\r\nlet it remain so. In future, no hard money should be distributed. You\r\nwill see the use I intend it for in a few days. I am sure it will\r\ndivert you. I hope soon to make up another party of sixty. If\r\nLieutenant Freeman is not returned to you, I shall send for him. Are\r\nthe wagons you mentioned some time ago returned? What is become of the\r\nrifles? I want them much for the servants who go out with me on\r\nhorseback. All returning parties should march together till they\r\narrive at the cantonment of the first corps, then with their\r\nrespective officers. This will prevent disorders.\r\n\r\nAfter rain or snow, I wish you to inspect the arms, and order them, in\r\nyour presence, to discharge them at a mark. The few cartridges spent\r\nin this way will be well disposed of. Colonel Putnam is marched to the\r\nmouth of Croton. Greaton's, in two or three days, moves near Pine's\r\nbridge on that river. I think the present scarcity of bread will\r\nprevent a movement of the enemy with regular troops. Major-general\r\nPutnam is right in having the militia of Fairfield ready, if it has\r\nnot the effect on them, like that of the boy and the wolf in the\r\nfable. If Ensign Leeland is still on the lines, send him up as an\r\nevidence against Captain Brown.\r\n\r\nA sea-captain, who, with three others, made their escape from New-York\r\nthe night of the 4th instant, says fourteen sail of the Cork fleet had\r\narrived last Sunday.\r\n\r\nI am your affectionate\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 7th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI directed Major Platt, some days since, to inform you, no provision\r\nof any kind should be suffered to go below you till further orders.\r\nPlease to announce this to the justices. You have herewith a flag;\r\nfill up the blank. On its return, desire the officer to call at\r\nColonel Phillips's for any papers or catalogues of books which may be\r\nleft there for me. The letter to Mr. Delancey to be left with the\r\nenemy's officer on his advanced post. Cast your mind on the best means\r\nof sweeping Westchester and West Farms of the tories when it is good\r\nsledding, supposing two regiments to cover you. But this under the\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nGonsalez Manuel, the bearer of this, brings with him John Broughton, a\r\nprisoner of war, who is exchanged. You will please to order him kept\r\nat a convenient distance in the rear till the flag goes in, when he is\r\nto be sent and delivered to the commanding officer of the advanced\r\npost. A receipt must be taken for him and transmitted to me.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MCDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR PLATT.\r\n\r\nPeekskill, February 23d, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Burr,\r\n\r\nIn yours of yesterday you requested particular care of the enclosed,\r\nbut there was none. Malcolm left this yesterday for Haverstraw. He\r\nintends, with Major Pawling, to pay you a visit by water, and perhaps\r\nit will be to-day. I think there is some probability of his relieving\r\nyou. At any rate, you will be relieved by the time you wish.\r\n\r\nAs the general writes fully by this conveyance, I shall not be so\r\nparticular as I otherwise would. Cammell will be down shortly to pay\r\noff accounts. One dollar per day is allowed for a saddle-horse. Your\r\ncertificates to the Van Warts will entitle them to their pay, be it\r\nwhat it may.\r\n\r\nThe general has ordered Williams and Wattles to return the hard money\r\nto him. It will be put in your hands. Love to Roger, when he comes.\r\nCompliments to Malcolm's lads and Benson.\r\n\r\nWith singular affection,\r\n\r\nR. PLATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, 23d February, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour several favours have been handed to me. I have not time now to\r\nanswer them fully. It will, however, be done by Major Hull, who is\r\nordered down to assist you. All your wishes will be gratified. One\r\nhundred and twenty picked men, with bayonets, will reach you\r\nto-morrow. Send your commissary up for rum. Let him call on me.\r\n\r\nI am yours,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, 15th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour favour of the 12th came to hand with the prisoners. I have long\r\nknown Ackerly was up, and his business, but did not think his present\r\nsituation of sufficient importance to have him taken by K. Mr. Platt\r\nwill inform you how I intend to supply you with bayonets. He reached\r\nyou, I suppose, yesterday evening. I intend to send down the remains\r\nof Colonel Poor's regiment for a few days, to cover a forage making by\r\nMr. Hayes near Mamaroneck; and shall send by them public arms, with\r\nbayonets, to be exchanged for yours which want them. No good officer\r\nor man now below with you must be relieved till further orders. Give\r\nthe officers of Poor's all the advice and assistance you can. The\r\nmoney taken from Ketor will be divided among the officers and men in\r\nsuch manner as you think proper. I shall send them down six for one\r\nwhen I can raise cash.\r\n\r\nGreaton's is at Pine bridge. Nixon moves in two days to support\r\nPutnam. The stated express is on this side Croton, at his own house.\r\nHis name is John Cross, a refugee from New-York. Give me the earliest\r\nadvice of any appearance of a movement of the enemy on the river. Mrs.\r\nPollock was detained with the late bad weather two nights. She left\r\nthis at eight this morning.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR PLATT, AID TO GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, 25th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe general wishes you to detain the best officers and men, for five\r\ncomplete parties of sixty: and, as soon as Major Hull can be made\r\nacquainted with your posts, and the nature of your command, he desires\r\nyou will ride up to headquarters if there is no probability of a\r\nmovement from below, and he will concert with you such measures as\r\nshall be thought expedient.\r\n\r\nThe combustible balls are not yet come to hand. Five or six boxes of\r\nammunition will be sent down to Tarrytown by water the first\r\nopportunity. 'Tis necessary that Dr Eustis, if not at the Plains,\r\nshould be sent for.\r\n\r\nI am your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRICHARD PLATT, Aid-de-camp.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please to inform the general whether Colonel Poor's men have\r\naccomplished the business they were sent upon or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 26th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI received your letter of this day. Colonel Putnam is ordered to march\r\nand join you, and to act as circumstances shall cast up. Five boxes of\r\nammunition are ordered to be carried to you immediately from King's\r\nferry, by water. Leave a small party to receive it, and a cart to\r\ncarry it where you shall order it. As the strength of the enemy is not\r\nmentioned, I can give no other orders.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, 27th February, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour favour of yesterday reached me at 8 P.M. It was immediately\r\nanswered. Colonel Putnam was ordered to march and join you; he has\r\ntaken Nixon's regiment with him. Greaton's was put in motion at the\r\nsame time, to join the brigade, if the enemy did not continue to\r\nadvance in Connecticut. At half past ten of the same evening, five\r\nboxes of ammunition was sent to you from King's ferry, by water, with\r\norders to keep close in shore, for fear of accidents. I hope it has\r\nreached you. Your letter of this day, at 7 A. M., came to hand an hour\r\nago. From the reputed strength of the enemy, I am pleased with your\r\nposition. I think it promises success and laurels. I hope Bearmore\r\nwill smart for his temerity. You are all too remote from me to render\r\norders expedient. Circumstances must direct your movements. If the\r\nenemy _move_, or appear in _force_ on the river, or a movement on it\r\nin force should _apparently_ be intended, send up all Paterson's\r\ndetachments by _forced_ marches. I commit you and your corps to the\r\nLord of Hosts. Greaton has four boxes of spare ammunition. He will be\r\non the North Castle road to the Plains.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 6th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThis will be delivered to you by Mr. John Pine, who acted last\r\ncampaign as a horse-guide. He is a true friend to the country.\r\nWhenever he shall get properly mounted, and reports himself to you for\r\nservice, give him a certificate of the day, and employ him.\r\n\r\nEnclosed you have a list of horse-thieves and others who act very\r\nprejudicial to our cause. I wish to have them taken and sent up here.\r\nPerhaps it will be most eligible to make the attempt on all at the\r\nsame time. But I do not wish to retard the forage on your left, as\r\nthose posts are in great want of that article.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL PUTNAM.\r\n\r\nCamp, Horse Neck, 9th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from Colonel Emerick (British), informing me\r\nthat one Butler, who has been a prisoner in New-York, being unable to\r\ntravel on foot, obtained of Colonel Emerick a dragoon and two horses\r\nto conduct him some part of his way in the country. That Butler made\r\nthe dragoon drunk, then brought him off, together with the horses. The\r\nwhole of which he, in his letter, makes a demand to be returned.\r\n\r\nColonel Emerick has been misinformed as to Butler's acting so\r\nfaithless. The truth of the matter is, that Butler wanted the dragoon\r\nto return with the horses, but that he (the dragoon) refused to do,\r\nand swore he would never return. I would advise you by all means to\r\nsend the dragoon to Colonel Emerick in irons, together with the\r\nhorses, as a refusal would be contrary to all public faith.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nISRAEL PUTNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 11th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYours of the 9th has reached me. If the militia of Colonel Drake's are\r\ngood men, arm them of General Paterson's, and I will replace them to\r\nhim. Take the receipts of every man who shall be armed by the public,\r\nand send them to me. The old general is not a civilian. Send Colonel\r\nEmerick the enclosed copy of the horseman's deposition. Stop no\r\nprovisions, when small quantities answer for the purpose of -----. The\r\nplunderers will be punished on the lines, but tried here. The names of\r\nthe witnesses are wanting. What you wrote for, to answer certain\r\npurposes, shall be collected as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nGive me the true history of the facts relative to the mare sold by\r\nWattles. He quibbles. Did he know the printed orders?--was she sold\r\nconformable? The paymasters will be ordered down, and soap shall be\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nIn haste, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MCDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding correspondence is evidence of the military character of\r\nColonel Burr, and his standing with General McDOUGALL. Although his\r\nrank was only that of a lieutenant-colonel, yet he was constantly in\r\nthe actual command of a regiment, and frequently of a brigade. His\r\nseniors were withdrawn from the post (which was generally a post of\r\ndanger) where he was stationed; or detachments were taken from\r\ndifferent regiments so as to make up for him a separate and\r\nindependent command. No man had a better opportunity than Samuel\r\nYoung, Esq., of knowing Colonel Burr's habits and conduct while\r\nstationed in Westchester. Mr. Young was at one time a member of the\r\nstate legislature, and for many years surrogate of the county. The\r\nfollowing letter contains some interesting details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL YOUNG TO COMMODORE VALENTINE MORRIS.\r\n\r\nMount Pleasant (Westchester), 25th January, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 30th ultimo, asking for some account of the\r\ncampaign in which I served, under the command of Colonel Burr, during\r\nthe revolutionary war, was received some days ago, and has been\r\nconstantly in my mind. I will reply to it with pleasure, but the\r\ncompass of a letter will not admit of much detail.\r\n\r\nI resided in the lines from the commencement of the revolution until\r\nthe winter of the year 1780, when my father's house was burnt, by\r\norder of the British general. The county of Westchester, very soon\r\nafter the commencement of hostilities, became, on account of its\r\nexposed situation, a scene of deepest distress. From the Croton to\r\nKingsbridge, every species of rapine and lawless violence prevailed.\r\nNo man went to his bed but under the apprehension of having his house\r\nplundered or burnt, or himself or family massacred, before morning.\r\nSome, under the character of whigs, plundered the tories; while\r\nothers, of the latter description, plundered the whigs. Parties of\r\nmarauders, assuming either character or none, as suited their\r\nconvenience, indiscriminately assailed both whigs and tories. So\r\nlittle vigilance was used on our part, that emissaries and spies of\r\nthe enemy passed and repassed without interruption.\r\n\r\nThese calamities continued undiminished until the arrival of Colonel\r\nBurr, in the autumn of the year 1778. He took command of the same\r\ntroops which his predecessor, Colonel Littlefield, commanded. At the\r\nmoment of Colonel Burr's arrival, Colonel Littlefield [1] had returned\r\nfrom a plundering expedition (for to plunder those called tories was\r\nthen deemed lawful), and had brought up horses, cattle, bedding,\r\nclothing, and other articles of easy transportation, which he had\r\nproposed to distribute among the party the next day. Colonel Burr's\r\nfirst act of authority was to seize and secure all this plunder; and\r\nhe immediately took measures for restoring it to the owners. This gave\r\nus much trouble, but it was abundantly repaid by the confidence it\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nHe then made known his determination to suppress plundering. The same\r\nday he visited all the guards; changed their position; dismissed some\r\nof the officers, whom he found totally incompetent; gave new\r\ninstructions. On the same day, also, he commenced a register of the\r\nnames and characters of all who resided near and below his guards.\r\nDistinguished by secret marks the whig, the timid whig, the tory, the\r\nhorse-thief, and those concerned in, or suspected of, giving\r\ninformation to the enemy. He also began a map of the country, in the\r\nvicinity of the fort; of the roads, by-roads, paths, creeks, morasses,\r\n&c., which might become hiding-places for the disaffected or for\r\nmarauding parties. This map was made by Colonel Burr himself, from\r\nsuch materials as he could collect on the spot, but principally from\r\nhis own observation.\r\n\r\nHe raised and established a corps of horsemen from among the\r\nrespectable farmers and young men of the country, of tried patriotism,\r\nfidelity, and courage. These also served as aids and confidential\r\npersons for the transmission of orders. To this corps I attached\r\nmyself as a volunteer, but did not receive pay. He employed discreet\r\nand faithful persons, living near the enemy's lines, to watch their\r\nmotions, and give him immediate intelligence. He employed mounted\r\nvidettes for the same purpose, directing two of them to proceed\r\ntogether, so that one might be despatched, if necessary, with\r\ninformation to the colonel, while the other might watch the enemy's\r\nmovement. He established signals throughout the lines, so that,\r\nwhether by night or by day, instant notice could be had of an attack\r\nor movement of the enemy. He enforced various regulations for\r\nconcealing his positions and force from the enemy. The laxity of\r\ndiscipline which had before prevailed enabled the enemy frequently to\r\nemploy their emissaries to come within the lines, and to learn the\r\nprecise state of our forces, supplies, &c. Colonel Burr soon put an\r\nend to these dangerous intrusions, by prohibiting all persons residing\r\nbelow the lines, except a few whom he selected, such as Parson Bartow,\r\nJacob Smith, and others, whose integrity was unimpeachable, from\r\napproaching the outposts, without special permission for the purpose.\r\nIf any one had a complaint or request to make of the colonel, he\r\nprocured one or more of the persons he had selected to come to his\r\nquarters on his behalf. This measure prevented frivolous and vexatious\r\napplications, and the still more dangerous approach of enemies in\r\ndisguise. All these measures were entirely new; and, within eight or\r\nten days, the whole system appeared to be in complete operation, and\r\nthe face of things was totally changed.\r\n\r\nA few days after the colonel's arrival, the house of one Gedney was\r\nplundered in the night, and the family abused and terrified. Gedney\r\nsent his son to make a representation of it to the colonel. The young\r\nman, not regarding the orders which had been issued, came to the\r\ncolonel's quarters, undiscovered by the sentinels, having taken a\r\nsecret path through the fields for the purpose. For this violation of\r\norders the young man was punished. The colonel immediately took\r\nmeasures for the detection of the plunderers; and though they were all\r\ndisguised, and wholly unknown to Gedney, yet Colonel Burr, by means\r\nwhich were never yet disclosed, discovered the plunderers, and had\r\nthem all secured within twenty-four hours. Gedney's family, on\r\nreference to his register, appeared to be tories; but Burr had\r\npromised that every quiet man should be protected.\r\n\r\nHe caused the robbers to be conveyed to Gedney's house, under the\r\ncharge of Captain Benson, there to restore the booty they had taken,\r\nto make reparation in money for such articles as were lost or damaged,\r\nand for the alarm and abuse, the amount of which the colonel assessed,\r\nto be flogged ten lashes, and to ask pardon of the old man; all which\r\nwas faithfully and immediately executed.\r\n\r\nThese measures gave universal satisfaction, and the terror they\r\ninspired effectually prevented a repetition of similar depredations.\r\nFrom this day plundering ceased. No further instance occurred during\r\nthe time of Colonel Burr's command, for it was universally believed\r\nthat Colonel Burr could tell a robber by looking in his face, or that\r\nhe had supernatural means of discovering crime. Indeed, I was myself\r\ninclined to these opinions. This belief was confirmed by another\r\ncircumstance which had previously occurred. On the day of his arrival,\r\nafter our return from visiting the posts, conversing with several of\r\nhis attendants, and, among others, Lieutenant Drake, whom Burr had\r\nbrought with him from his own regiment, he said, \"Drake, that post on\r\nthe North river will be attacked before morning; neither officers nor\r\nmen know any thing of their duty; you must go and take charge of it;\r\nkeep your eyes open, or you will have your throat cut.\" Drake went.\r\nThe post was attacked that night by a company of horse. They were\r\nrepulsed with loss. Drake returned in the morning with trophies of\r\nwar, and told his story. We stared, and asked one another--How could\r\nBurr know that? He had not then established any means of intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe measures immediately adopted by him were such that it was\r\nimpossible for the enemy to have passed their own lines without his\r\nhaving immediate knowledge; and it was these very measures which saved\r\nMajor Hull, on whom the command devolved for a short time, when the\r\nstate of Colonel Burr's health compelled him to retire.\r\n\r\nThese measures, together with the deportment of Colonel Burr, gained\r\nhim the love and veneration of all devoted to the common cause, and\r\nconciliated even its bitterest foes. His habits were a subject of\r\nadmiration. His diet was simple and spare in the extreme. Seldom\r\nsleeping more than an hour at a time, and without taking off his\r\nclothes, or even his boots.\r\n\r\nBetween midnight and two o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two or\r\nthree of his corps of horsemen, he visited the quarters of all his\r\ncaptains, and their picket-guards, changing his route from time to\r\ntime to prevent notice of his approach. You may judge of the severity\r\nof this duty, when I assure you that the distance which he thus rode\r\nevery night must have been from _sixteen_ to _twenty-four_ miles; and\r\nthat, with the exception of two nights only, in which he was otherwise\r\nengaged, he never omitted these excursions, even in the severest and\r\nmost stormy weather; and, except the short time necessarily consumed\r\nin hearing and answering complaints and petitions from persons both\r\nabove and below the lines, Colonel Burr was constantly with the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nHe attended to the minutest article of their comfort; to their\r\nlodgings; to their diet: for those off duty he invented sports, all\r\ntending to some useful end. During two or three weeks after the\r\ncolonel's arrival, we had many sharp conflicts with the robbers and\r\nhorse-thieves, who were hunted down with unceasing industry. In many\r\ninstances we encountered great superiority of numbers, but always with\r\nsuccess. Many of them were killed, and many were taken.\r\n\r\nThe strictest discipline prevailed, and the army felt the fullest\r\nconfidence in their commander and in themselves, and by these means\r\nbecame really formidable to the enemy. During the same winter,\r\nGovernor Tryon planned an expedition to Horse Neck, for the purpose of\r\ndestroying the salt-works erected there, and marched with about 2000\r\nmen. Colonel Burr received early information of their movements, and\r\nsent word to General Putnam to hold the enemy at bay for a few hours,\r\nand he (Colonel Burr) would be in their rear and be answerable for\r\nthem. By a messenger from him, Colonel Burr was informed by that\r\ngeneral that he had been obliged to retreat, and that the enemy were\r\nadvancing into Connecticut. This information, which unfortunately was\r\nnot correct, altered Colonel Burr's route towards Mamaroneck, which\r\nenabled Tryon to get the start of him. Colonel Burr then endeavoured\r\nto interrupt him in Eastchester, according to his first plan, and\r\nactually got within cannon-shot of him; but Tryon ran too fast, and in\r\nhis haste left most or all of his cattle and plunder behind him, and\r\nmany stragglers, who were picked up.\r\n\r\nI will mention another enterprise, which proved more successful,\r\nthough equally hazardous. Soon after Tryon's retreat, Colonel\r\nDelancey, who commanded the British refugees, in order to secure\r\nthemselves against surprise, erected a block-house on a rising ground\r\nbelow Delancey's bridge. This Colonel Burr resolved to destroy. I was\r\nin that expedition, and recollect the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe procured a number of hand-grenades, also rolls of port-fire, and\r\ncanteens filled with inflammable materials, with contrivances to\r\nattach them to the side of the block-house. He set out with his troops\r\nearly in the evening, and arrived within a mile of the block-house by\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning. The colonel gave Captain Black the command\r\nof about forty volunteers, who were first to approach. Twenty of them\r\nwere to carry the port-fires, &c., &c. Those who had hand-grenades had\r\nshort ladders to enable them to reach the port-holes, the exact height\r\nof which Colonel Burr had ascertained. Colonel Burr gave Captain Black\r\nhis instructions, in the hearing of his company, assuring him of his\r\nprotection if they were attacked by superior numbers; for it was\r\nexpected that the enemy, who had several thousand men at and near\r\nKingsbridge, would endeavour to cut us off, as we were several miles\r\nbelow them. Burr directed those who carried the combustibles to march\r\nin front as silently as possible. That, on being hailed, they should\r\nlight the hand-grenades, &c., with a slow match provided for the\r\npurpose, and throw them into the port-holes. I was one of the party\r\nthat advanced. The sentinel hailed and fired. We rushed on. The first\r\nhand-grenade that was thrown in drove the enemy from the upper story,\r\nand before they could take any measure to defend it, the block-house\r\nwas on fire in several places. Some few escaped, and the rest\r\nsurrendered without our having lost a single man. Though many shot\r\nwere fired at us, we did not fire a gun.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Colonel Burr's command, but two attempts were\r\nmade by the enemy to surprise our guards, in both of which they were\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nAfter Colonel Burr left this command, Colonel Thompson, a man of\r\napproved bravery, assumed it, and the enemy, in open day, advanced to\r\nhis headquarters, took Colonel Thompson, and took or killed all his\r\nmen, with the exception of about thirty.\r\n\r\nMy father's house, with all his outhouses, were burnt. After these\r\ndisasters our troops never made an effort to protect that part of the\r\ncountry. The American lines were afterwards changed, and extended from\r\nBedford to Croton bridge, and from there, following the course of that\r\nriver, to the Hudson. All the intermediate country was abandoned and\r\nunprotected, being about twenty miles in the rear of the ground which\r\nColonel Burr had maintained.\r\n\r\nThe year after the defeat of Colonel Thompson, Colonel Green, a brave,\r\nand in many respects a valuable officer, took the command, making his\r\nheadquarters at Danford's, about a mile above the Croton. This\r\nposition was well chosen. But Colonel Green omitted to inform himself\r\nof the movements of the enemy, and consequently was surprised.\r\nHimself, Major Flagg, and other officers were killed, and a great part\r\nof the men were either killed or taken prisoners: yet these officers\r\nhad the full benefit of Colonel Burr's system.\r\n\r\nHaving perused what I have written, it does not appear to me that I\r\nhave conveyed any adequate idea of Burr's military character. It may\r\nbe aided a little by reviewing the effects he produced. The troops of\r\nwhich he took command were, at the time he took the command,\r\nundisciplined, negligent, and discontented. Desertions were frequent.\r\nIn a few days these very men were transformed into brave and honest\r\ndefenders; orderly, contented, and cheerful; confident in their own\r\ncourage, and loving to adoration their commander, whom every man\r\nconsidered as his personal friend. It was thought a severe punishment,\r\nas well as disgrace, to be sent up to the camp, where they had nothing\r\nto do but to lounge and eat their rations.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this command there was not a single desertion. Not\r\na single death by sickness. Not one made prisoner by the enemy; for\r\nBurr had taught us that a soldier with arms in his hand ought never,\r\nunder any circumstances, to surrender; no matter if he was opposed to\r\nthousands, it was his duty to fight.\r\n\r\nAfter the first ten days there was not a single instance of robbery.\r\nThe whole country, under his command, enjoyed security. The\r\ninhabitants, to express their gratitude, frequently brought presents\r\nof such articles as the country afforded; but Colonel Burr would\r\naccept no present. He fixed reasonable prices, and paid in cash for\r\nevery thing that was received, and sometimes, I know, that these\r\npayments were made with his own money. Whether these advances were\r\nrepaid, I know not.\r\n\r\nColonel Simcoe, one of the most daring and active partisans in the\r\nBritish army, was, with Colonels Emerick and Delancey, opposed to Burr\r\non the lines, yet they were completely held in check.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the highest eulogy on Colonel Burr is, that no man could\r\nbe found capable of executing his plans, though the example was before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen Burr left the lines a sadness overspread the country, and the\r\nmost gloomy forebodings were too soon fulfilled, as you have seen\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe period of Colonel Burr's command was so full of activity and of\r\nincident, that every day afforded some new lesson of instruction. But\r\nyou will expect only a general outline, and this faint one is the best\r\nin my power to give.\r\n\r\nWith esteem, yours,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. See Chapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe military career of Colonel Burr was now drawing to a close. The\r\nstate of his health became alarming. His constitution was shattered.\r\nHis medical and other friends were of the opinion that he was\r\nincapable of enduring the fatigues of another campaign. In the\r\njudgment and talents of Dr. Eustis he reposed great confidence. That\r\ngentleman pressed upon him, in a manner the most affectionate, the\r\nnecessity for his retiring. The sacrifice required of Burr was\r\ninconceivably great. All his views and feelings were military. He\r\nseemed as though he was born a soldier. He was ambitious of fame in\r\nhis profession. He had acquired a character for vigilance and\r\nintrepidity unrivalled in the army. He was more than respected by his\r\nbrother officers, and idolized by the troops. As a man and a citizen,\r\nhe was exceedingly disliked by General Washington. Causes, unnecessary\r\nto examine at this late period of time, had created between these\r\ngentlemen feelings of hostility that were unconquerable, and were\r\nnever softened or mollified. Yet even General Washington, while he\r\nconsidered Burr destitute of morals and of principle, respected him as\r\na soldier, and gave repeated evidence of entire confidence in his\r\ngallantry, his persevering industry, his judgment, and his discretion.\r\nAt length, however, protracted disease compelled him to abandon all\r\nthose hopes of glory, nobly won in the battle-field, which had\r\ninflamed his ardent and youthful mind; and on the 10th of March, 1779,\r\nhe tendered to the commander-in-chief his resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nPhillipsburgh, 10th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe reasons I did myself the honour to mention to your excellency in a\r\nletter of September last still exist, and determine me to resign my\r\nrank and command in the army.\r\n\r\nThe polite indulgence you favoured me with at that time restored\r\ntemporarily my health. At the instance of General McDOUGALL, I\r\naccepted the command of these posts; but I find my health unequal to\r\nthe undertaking, and have acquainted him of my intentions to retire.\r\nHe has ordered an officer to relieve me before the 15th of March, on\r\nwhich day I purpose to leave this command and the army.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nMiddlebrook, 3d April, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge your favour of the 10th ultimo. Perfectly\r\nsatisfied that no consideration save a desire to reestablish your\r\nhealth could induce you to leave the service, I cannot therefore\r\nwithhold my consent. But, in giving permission to your retiring from\r\nthe army, I am not only to regret the loss of a good officer, but the\r\ncause which makes his resignation necessary. When it is convenient to\r\ntransmit the settlement of your public accounts, it will receive my\r\nfinal acceptance.\r\n\r\nI am, &c.,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days previous to Colonel Burr's resignation of his commission,\r\nhe received from the widow of General Montgomery the following\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. J. MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\nRhinebeck, 7th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI should before this have answered your obliging letter, had not the\r\nmarriage of my eldest sister entirely taken up my time. I now return\r\nyou, sir, many thanks for your kind offers of service. The sincerity\r\nwith which they were made would have allowed me to accept them,\r\nwithout fears of giving you trouble, had I not determined to run no\r\nmore risks, as I have been very unfortunate in my ventures that way.\r\n\r\nYou have awakened all my sensibility by the praises you bestow on my\r\nunfortunate general. He was, indeed, an angel sent us for a moment.\r\nAlas! for me, that this world was not more worthy of him--then had I\r\nstill been the happiest of women, _and his friends in stations more\r\nequal to their own merits_. Reflections like these imbitter\r\ncontinually each day as it passes. But I trust in the same merciful\r\nHand which has held me from sinking in my extreme calamity, that he\r\nwill still support and make me worthy of a blessed meeting hereafter.\r\nCan you excuse, sir, the overflowing of a heart that knows not where\r\nto stop when on a subject so interesting?\r\n\r\nMr. Tutard tells me you mean to quit the service. Whenever that\r\nhappens, you will doubtless have leisure to pay us a visit, which I\r\nwish you to believe will give real pleasure to,\r\n\r\nSir, your obliged\r\n\r\nJ. MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\nThe Ponds, 18th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI came to this place yesterday in the afternoon, and regret extremely\r\nthat I did not arrive earlier in the day, as I should have received\r\nyour letter. My stay here will be uncertain. At home I must be by the\r\nbeginning of April. I should be happy in seeing you before my return,\r\nbut how to effect it is the question. If I could possibly disengage\r\nmyself from business, I would take a ride to Paramus. My best respects\r\nawait on Mrs. Prevost; and every thing you think proper to the\r\nmistress of your affections. I am married, Burr, and happy. May you be\r\nequally so. I cannot form a higher or a better wish. You know I should\r\nrejoice to meet you. Tell Mrs. Prevost that I shall take it unkindly\r\nif she does not call upon me whenever she thinks I can be of any\r\nservice to her. To oblige her will give me pleasure for her own sake,\r\nand double pleasure for yours. This is a strange, unconnected scroll;\r\nyou have it as it comes.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on your return to civil life, for which (I cannot\r\nforbear the thought) we must thank a certain lady not far from\r\nParamus. May I have occasion soon to thank her on another account; and\r\nmay I congratulate you both in the course of the next moon for being\r\nin my line: I mean the married. Adieu.\r\n\r\nI am most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Peekskill, 20th March, 1779.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nMy late intelligence from New-York and headquarters clearly mark the\r\nenemy's intention to make a movement very soon. Whether it is intended\r\nagainst the grand army, these posts, or New-London, time only can\r\ndetermine. It is, however, our duty to be prepared. As a few days will\r\nopen up his views, _I imagine you do not think of quitting the ground\r\nwhen business is to be done_. Should the enemy move up the river in\r\nforce, his thieves will be very busy below. Colonel Hammond's\r\nregiment, on such an event, is to remain there; and one hundred rank\r\nand file of continental troops _only_ are to keep them in countenance.\r\nThe rest, under charge of officers, to be sent up to join their corps.\r\n\r\nYou know the state of forage at this post. I wish you would make an\r\nexertion to your left in front, to secure all you can for us; as much\r\nas will consist with the safety of your party, and covering to the\r\nrebels at Tarrytown. Send for Haynes and his assistant, and keep them\r\non the ground till they secure all that is practicable to be got from\r\nyour left. The weather has been so stormy and uncertain, the ----- are\r\nnot yet sent for. To-morrow morning it will be done. Please to attend\r\nto the enclosed order respecting provisions. Late Learned's is moved\r\nto West Point.\r\n\r\nMajor Hull's, of the 19th, is this moment received, and will be\r\nattended to. I wish Captain Kearsley, Lieutenants Hunter and Lawrence,\r\nto be sent to their regiments when Colonel Burr has finished what he\r\nintends. They are much wanted. Note the contents of the enclosed\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nYours, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that Colonel Burr, while he commanded at White\r\nPlains, on the frontier, not only kept the adjacent country in a state\r\nof security, but that he kept the enemy in complete check. He was\r\nsucceeded in his command by Colonel Littlefield, who was soon\r\ncaptured, and the post abandoned. Major Hull, in a letter to Colonel\r\nBurr, dated the 29th of May, 1779, says, \"_The ground you so long\r\ndefended is now left to the depredations of the enemy, and our friends\r\nin distressing circumstances_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of June, Sir Henry Clinton captured the forts at\r\nStony Point and Verplanck's Point, and threatened West Point. His\r\nforce in this direction was upwards of six thousand rank and file. The\r\ncommunication between General Washington, who was in New-Jersey, and\r\nGeneral McDOUGALL, who was at Newburgh, was greatly embarrassed.\r\nBandits were placed by the British in or near the passes through the\r\nchains of mountains leading to Sussex, for the purpose of capturing\r\nthe expresses charged with despatches. At this critical moment Colonel\r\nBurr was on a visit to McDOUGALL, who informed him that he had made\r\nvarious unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Washington, and that\r\nhis expresses had either been captured or had deserted. After\r\napologizing to Burr, who was no longer in active service, the general\r\nstated the importance of the commander-in-chief's knowing the position\r\nand movements of the enemy, as well as the state of the American army.\r\nHe then very courteously requested Burr to be the bearer of a verbal\r\ncommunication to Washington on the subject. To this, notwithstanding\r\nhis ill health and the danger of the enterprise, he assented. The\r\nmission was undertaken and succeeded. He was also charged at the same\r\ntime with _verbal_ orders from General St. Clair, of a confidential\r\ncharacter, to officers commanding at different posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To whom it may concern_:--\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, being on urgent public business, is to be put across the\r\nferry to New-Windsor without delay. Given this second day of June,\r\n1779.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER McDOUGALL, Major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To whom it may concern_:--\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, being on very pressing public business, every magistrate\r\nwill assist him in changing horses, and all friends of the country\r\nwill also assist him.\r\n\r\nJune 2d, 1779. ALEXANDER McDOUGALL, Major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To whom it may concern_:--\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, being on urgent public business, must be put across the\r\nferry to Fishkill landing without a moment's delay. Given at Pompton,\r\n3d June, 1779.\r\n\r\nARTHUR ST. CLAIR, Major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To whom it may concern_:--\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster and commissary, at Newburgh or New-Windsor, will\r\nreceive and observe, as my orders, the verbal directions given by\r\nColonel Burr. Given at Pompton, 3d June, 1779.\r\n\r\nARTHUR ST. CLAIR, Major-general.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this enterprise a most amusing incident occurred. Colonel Burr\r\narrived at the iron-works of the elder Townsend, in Orange county,\r\nwith a tired and worn-out horse. No other could be obtained; but,\r\nafter some detention, a half-broken mule, named _Independence_, was\r\nprocured, and the colonel mounted. But _Independence_ refused to obey\r\norders, and a battle ensued. The mule ran off with his rider, and\r\nascended a high bank, on the side of which stood a coal-house, filled\r\nwith coal through an aperture in the top. At length, _Independence_,\r\nin the hope of clearing himself of his encumbrance, entered the\r\ncoal-house at full speed, the colonel firmly keeping his seat, and\r\nboth came down an inclined plane of coal, not less than thirty feet in\r\nheight. On reaching the ground without injury, Burr hired a man to\r\nlead the animal a mile or two, and then again mounted him and pursued\r\nhis journey. This scene was exhibited on a hot day in the month of\r\nJune, amid a cloud of coal-dust. The anecdote Burr occasionally\r\nrepeated to his friends, and some of the younger branches of the\r\nTownsend family.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of July, 1779, Colonel Burr, then in feeble health,\r\nvisited his friends in Connecticut. He was at New-Haven when, on the\r\n5th of July, the British landed, with 2600 men, in two divisions; one\r\nunder Governor Tryon, at East Haven, and the other under Garth, at\r\nWest Haven. At East Haven, where Tryon commanded, great excesses were\r\ncommitted, and the town set on fire. Colonel Burr was at this moment\r\nconfined to his bed; but, on hearing that the enemy were advancing,\r\nrose and proceeded to a part of the town where a number of persons had\r\ncollected. He volunteered to take command of the militia, and made an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to rally them. At this moment he was informed\r\nthat the students had organized themselves, and were drawn up in the\r\ncollege-yard. He immediately galloped to the ground, and addressed\r\nthem; appealing, in a few words, to their patriotism and love of\r\ncountry; imploring them to set the example, and march out in the\r\ndefence of those rights which would, at a future day, become their\r\ninheritance. All he asked was, that they would receive and follow him\r\nas their leader.\r\n\r\nThe military character of Colonel Burr was known to the students. They\r\nconfided in his intrepidity, experience, and judgment. In their ranks\r\nthere was no faltering. They promptly obeyed the summons, and\r\nvolunteered. Some skirmishing soon ensued, and portions of the militia\r\nunited with them. The British, ignorant of the force that might be\r\npresented, retired; but shortly returned, with several pieces of\r\nartillery, when a cannonading commenced, and the boys retreated in\r\ngood order. An American historian says,--\"The British entered the town\r\nafter being much galled and harassed.\" The slight check which they\r\nthus received afforded an opportunity for the removal of some\r\nvaluables, and many of the women and children.\r\n\r\nTrifling and unimportant as this skirmishing appears to have been,\r\nColonel Burr never referred to the incident but with exultation and\r\npride. Perhaps no event in his military life has he more frequently\r\nmentioned. The confidence evinced by these young men he considered\r\ncomplimentary to himself as a soldier; and usually alluded to the\r\ncircumstance as evidence of the effect which the character of an\r\nofficer would ever have upon undisciplined men, when called to command\r\nthem upon trying occasions.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written by Colonel Platt, will close all that is\r\nintended to be said of Colonel Burr as a soldier. More space has been\r\noccupied with an account of his military character than would have\r\nbeen thus occupied, if it was not known that he felt proud of his own\r\ncareer as an officer. For history Mr. Burr entertained a great\r\ncontempt. He confided but little in its details. These prejudices were\r\nprobably strengthened by the consideration that justice, in his\r\nopinion, had not been done to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL RICHARD PLATT TO COMMODORE VALENTINE MORRIS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, January 27th, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn reply to yours of the 20th of November last, requesting to be\r\ninformed what was the reputation and services of Colonel Burr during\r\nthe revolutionary war? I give you the following detail of facts, which\r\nyou may rely on. No man was better acquainted with him, and his\r\nmilitary operations, than your humble servant, who served in that war\r\nfrom the 28th of June, 1775, till the evacuation of our capital on the\r\nmemorable 25th of November, 1783; having passed through the grades of\r\nlieutenant, captain, major, major of brigade, aid-de-camp, deputy\r\nadjutant-general, and deputy quartermaster-general; the last of which\r\nby selection and recommendation of Generals Greene, McDOUGALL, and\r\nKnox, in the most trying crisis of the revolution, viz., the year\r\n1780, when the continental money ceased to pass, and there was no\r\nother fiscal resources during that campaign but what resulted from the\r\ncreative genius of Timothy Pickering, at that crisis appointed\r\nsuccessor to General Greene, the second officer of the American army,\r\nwho resigned the department because there was no money in the national\r\ncoffers to carry it through the campaign, declaring that he could not,\r\nand would not attempt it, without adequate resources, such as he\r\nabounded in during the term of nearly three years antecedently as\r\nquartermaster-general.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing, by way of elucidation, it is to be\r\nunderstood by you, that so early as from the latter part of the year\r\n1776, I was always attached to a commanding general; and, in\r\nconsequence, my knowledge of the officers and their merits was more\r\ngeneral than that of almost any other in service. My operations were\r\nupon the extended scale, from the remotest parts of Canada, wherever\r\nthe American standard had waved, to the splendid theatre of Yorktown,\r\nwhen and where I was adjutant-general to the chosen troops of the\r\nnorthern army.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the revolution, Colonel Burr, then about\r\neighteen years of age, at the first sound of the trump of war (as if\r\nbred in the camp of the great Frederick, whose maxim was \"to hold his\r\narmy always in readiness to break a lance with, or throw a dart\r\nagainst, any assailant\"), quit his professional studies, and rushed to\r\nthe camp of General Washington, at Cambridge, as a volunteer from\r\nwhich he went with Colonel Arnold on his daring enterprise against\r\nQuebec, through the wilds of Canada (which vied with Hannibal's march\r\nover the Alps), during which toilsome and hazardous march he attracted\r\nthe attention and admiration of his commander so much, that he\r\n(Arnold) sent him alone to meet and hurry down General Montgomery's\r\narmy from Montreal to his assistance; and recommended him to that\r\ngeneral, who appointed him an aid-de-camp, in which capacity he acted\r\nduring the winter, till the fatal assault on Quebec, in which that\r\ngallant general, his aid McPherson, and Captain Cheeseman, commanding\r\nthe forlorn hope, fell. He afterwards continued as aid to Arnold, the\r\nsurvivor in command.\r\n\r\nHere I must begin to draw some of the outlines of his genius and\r\nvalour, which, like those of the British immortal, Wolf, who, at the\r\nage of twenty-four, and only major of the 20th regiment, serving on\r\nthe continent, gave such specimens of genius and talents as to evince\r\nhis being destined for command.\r\n\r\nAt the perilous moment of Montgomery's death, when dismay and\r\nconsternation universally prevailed, and the column halted, he\r\nanimated the troops, and made many efforts to lead them on; and\r\nstimulated them to enter the lower town; and might have succeeded, but\r\nfor the positive orders of Colonel Donald Campbell, the commanding\r\nofficer, for the troops to retreat. Had his plan been carried into\r\neffect, it might have saved Arnold's division from capture, which had,\r\nafter our retreat, to contend with all the British force instead of a\r\npart. On this occasion I commanded the first company in the first\r\nNew-York regiment, at the head of Montgomery's column, so that I speak\r\nfrom ocular demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe next campaign, 1776, Colonel Burr was appointed aid-de-camp to\r\nMajor-general Putnam, second in command under General Washington at\r\nNew-York; and from my knowledge of that general's qualities and the\r\ncolonel's, I am very certain that the latter directed all the\r\nmovements and operations of the former.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1777, the continental establishment for the war commenced.\r\nThen Colonel Burr was appointed by General Washington a\r\nlieutenant-colonel in Malcolm's regiment, in which he continued to\r\nserve until April, 1779, when the ill state of his health obliged him\r\nto retire from active service, to the regret of General McDOUGALL,\r\ncommanding the department, and that of the commander-in-chief, who\r\noffered to give him a furlough for any length of time, and to get\r\npermission from the British general in New-York for him to go to\r\nBermuda for his health. This item will show his value in the\r\nestimation of Generals Washington and McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1777, Malcolm's regiment was with the main\r\narmy, and commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Burr. For discipline, order,\r\nand system, it was not surpassed by any in the service; and could his\r\n(the lieutenant-colonel's) and Wolfe's orderly-books be produced, they\r\nwould be very similar in point of military policy and instructions,\r\nand fit models for all regiments.\r\n\r\nThis regiment was also but led at the Valley Forge in 1777 and winter\r\nof 1778, under General Washington, and composed part of his army at\r\nthe battle of Monmouth on the 28th of June, 1778, and continued with\r\nit till the close of the campaign of that year, at which time it was\r\nplaced in garrison at West Point by General Gates; but, upon General\r\nMcDOUGALL's assuming the command of the posts in the highlands in\r\nDecember, Malcolm's, Spencer's, and Patten's regiments were together\r\nordered to Haverstraw. The three colonels were permitted to go home\r\nfor the winter on furlough, and Lieutenant-colonel Burr had the\r\ncommand of the whole brigade, at a very important advanced post.\r\n\r\nAt this period General McDOUGALL ordered a detachment of about three\r\nhundred troops, under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Littlefield,\r\nof the Massachusetts line, to guard the lines in Westchester county,\r\nthen extending from Tarrytown to White Plains, and from thence to\r\nMamaroneck or Sawpits, which last extension was guarded by Connecticut\r\ntroops from Major-general Putnam's division.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of affairs a very singular occurrence presented,\r\nviz., that neither Lieutenant-colonel Littlefield, nor any other of\r\nhis grade, in the two entire brigades of Massachusetts troops\r\ncomposing the garrison of West Point, from which the lines were to be\r\nrelieved, was competent, in the general's estimation, to give security\r\nto the army above and the lines of those below; and, in consequence,\r\nhe was compelled to call Colonel Burr from his station at Haverstraw\r\nto the more important command of the lines in Westchester, in which\r\nmeasure, unprecedented as it was, the officers acquiesced without a\r\nmurmur, from a conviction of its expediency. At this time I was doing\r\nthe duty of adjutant-general to General McDougall.\r\n\r\nIt was on this new and interesting theatre of war that the confidence\r\nand affections of the officers and soldiers (who now became permanent\r\non the lines, instead of being relieved every two or three weeks as\r\nbefore), as well as of the inhabitants, all before unknown to Colonel\r\nBurr, were inspired with confidence by a system of consummate skill,\r\nastonishing vigilance, and extreme activity, which, in like manner,\r\nmade such an impression on the enemy, that after an unsuccessful\r\nattack on one of his advanced posts, he never made any other attack on\r\nour lines during the winter.\r\n\r\nHis humanity, and constant regard to the security of the property and\r\npersons of the inhabitants from injury and insult, were not less\r\nconspicuous than his military skill, &c. No man was insulted or\r\ndisturbed. The health of the troops was perfect. Not a desertion\r\nduring the whole period of his command, nor a man made prisoner,\r\nalthough the colonel was constantly making prisoners.\r\n\r\nA country, which for three years before had been a scene of robbery,\r\ncruelty, and murder, became at once the abode of security and peace.\r\nThough his powers were despotic, they were exercised only for the\r\npeace, the security, and the protection of the surrounding country and\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1779, the latter part of it, Major Hull, an excellent\r\nofficer, then in the Massachusetts line, was sent down as second to\r\nColonel Burr, who, after having become familiarized to his system,\r\nsucceeded him for a short time in command, about the last of April, at\r\nwhich time Colonel Burr's health would not permit him to continue in\r\ncommand; but the major was soon compelled to fall back many miles, so\r\nas to be within supporting distance of the army at the highlands.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the service, and the ardent and increasing activity\r\nwith which he had devoted himself to his country's cause, for more\r\nthan four years, having materially impaired his health, he was\r\ncompelled to leave the post and retire from active service. It was two\r\nyears before he regained his health.\r\n\r\nMajor Hull has ever since borne uniformly the most honourable\r\ntestimony of the exalted talents of his commander, by declaring his\r\ngratitude for being placed under an officer whose system of duty was\r\ndifferent from that of all other commanders under whom he had served.\r\n\r\nHaving thus exhibited the colonel's line of march, and his operations\r\nin service, I must now present him in contrast with his equals in\r\nrank, and his superiors in command.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1777, the enemy came out on both sides of the Hudson\r\nsimultaneously, in considerable force, say from 2 to 3000 men. On the\r\neast side (at Peekskill) was a major-general of our army, with an\r\neffective force of about 2000 men. The enemy advanced, and our general\r\nretired without engaging them. Our barracks and storehouses, and the\r\nwhole village of Peekskill, were sacked and burnt, and the country\r\npillaged.\r\n\r\nOn the west side, at the mouth of the Clove, near Suffren's, was\r\nColonel Burr, commanding Malcolm's regiment, about three hundred and\r\nfifty men. On the first alarm he marched to find the enemy, and on the\r\nsame night attacked and took their picket-guard, rallied the country,\r\nand made such show of war, that the enemy retreated the next morning,\r\nleaving behind him the cattle, horses, and sheep he had plundered.\r\n\r\nThe year following, Lieutenant-colonel Thompson was sent to command on\r\nthe same lines in Westchester by General Heath, and he was surprised\r\nat nine or ten o'clock in the day, and made prisoner, with a great\r\npart of his detachment.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the succeeding winter, Colonel Greene, of the Rhode Island\r\nline, with his own and another Rhode Island regiment, who was a very\r\ndistinguished officer, and had with these two regiments, in the year\r\n1777, defeated the Hessian grenadiers under Count Donop, at Red Banks,\r\non the Delaware, who was mortally wounded and taken prisoner,\r\ncommanded on the lines in Westchester; there receded to Pine's bridge,\r\nand in this position Colonel Greene's troops were also surprised after\r\nbreakfast and dispersed, the colonel himself and Major Flagg killed,\r\nand many soldiers made prisoners, besides killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Hudson, in the year 1780, General Wayne, the\r\nhero of Stony Point, with a large command and field artillery, made an\r\nattack on a block-house nearly opposite to Dobbs's ferry, defended by\r\ncowboys, and was repulsed with loss; whereas Colonel Burr burnt and\r\ndestroyed one of a similar kind, in the winter of 1779, near\r\nDelancey's mills, with a very few men, and without any loss on his\r\npart, besides capturing the garrison.\r\n\r\nHere, my good friend commodore, I must drop the curtain till I see you\r\nin Albany, which will be on the first week in February, where I can\r\nand will convince you that he is the only man in America (that is, the\r\nUnited States) who is fit to be a lieutenant-general; and let you and\r\nI, and all the American people, look out for Mr. Madison's\r\nlieutenant-general in contrast.\r\n\r\nI am your friend,\r\n\r\nRICHARD PLATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn retiring from the army, Colonel Burr visited his friends in\r\nNew-Jersey and Connecticut. He had previously determined, as soon as\r\nhis health would permit, to commence the study of law. During the four\r\nyears he was in public service, his patrimony was greatly impaired.\r\nTowards his brethren in arms he had acted with liberality. Naturally\r\nof an improvident character, he adopted no means to preserve the\r\nproperty which he inherited. The cardinal vices of gaming and drinking\r\nhe avoided. But he was licentious in the extreme, and regardless of\r\nconsequences in the gratification of his desires. His extravagance was\r\nunrestrained when, in his opinion, necessary to the enjoyment of his\r\npleasures. From the arms of his nurse until he had numbered fourscore\r\nyears, he was perpetually the dupe of the artful and the selfish.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was about five feet six inches in height. He was well\r\nformed, and erect in his attitude. In all his movements there was a\r\nmilitary air. Although of small stature, yet there was about him a\r\nloftiness of mien that could not pass unnoticed by a stranger. His\r\ndeportment was polished and courtly. His features were regular, and\r\ngenerally considered handsome. His eye was jet black, with a\r\nbrilliancy never surpassed. The appropriate civilities of the\r\ndrawing-room were performed with a grace almost peculiar to himself.\r\nHis whole manner was inconceivably fascinating. As a gentleman, this\r\nwas his great theatre. He acted upon the principle that the female was\r\nthe weaker sex, and that they were all susceptible of flattery. His\r\ngreat art consisted in adopting it to the grade of intellect he\r\naddressed. In this respect he was singularly fortunate as well as\r\nadroit. In matters of gallantry he was excessively vain. This vanity\r\nsometimes rendered him ridiculous in the eyes of his best friends, and\r\noften enabled the most worthless and unprincipled to take advantage of\r\nhis credulity.\r\n\r\nSuch traits of character would appear to be incompatible with an\r\nelevated and towering mind; yet they usually influenced, and\r\nfrequently controlled, one of the greatest and most extraordinary men\r\nof the age. A volume of anecdotes might be related as evidence of\r\nColonel Burr's quickness of perception and tact at reply, when an\r\nill-judged or thoughtless expression was addressed by him to a lady.\r\nOne is sufficient for illustration.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Europe, in 1812, he met a maiden lady in\r\nBroadway somewhat advanced in life. He had not seen her for many\r\nyears. As she passed him, she exclaimed to a gentleman on whose arm\r\nshe was resting, \"Colonel Burr!\" Hearing his name mentioned, he\r\nsuddenly stopped and looked her in the face. \"Colonel,\" said she, \"you\r\ndo not recollect me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not, madam,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"It is Miss K., sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said he, \"Miss K. _yet_!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady, somewhat piqued, reiterated, \"Yes, sir, Miss K. _yet_!\"\r\n\r\nFeeling the delicacy of his situation, and the unfortunate error he\r\nhad committed, he gently took her hand, and emphatically remarked,\r\n\"Well, madam, then I venture to assert _that it is not the fault of my\r\nsex_.\"\r\n\r\nOn Burr's being appointed, in 1777, a lieutenant-colonel in the army,\r\nhe joined his regiment, then stationed at Ramapoa, in New-Jersey. At\r\nParamus, not far distant, resided Mrs. Prevost, the wife of Colonel\r\nPrevost, of the British army. She was an accomplished and intelligent\r\nlady. Her husband was with his regiment in the West Indies, where he\r\ndied early in the revolutionary war. She had a sister residing with\r\nher. It was her son, the Hon. John B. Prevost, who in 1802 was\r\nrecorder of the city of New-York, and subsequently district judge of\r\nthe United States Court for the district of Louisiana. The house of\r\nMrs. Prevost was the resort of the most accomplished officers in the\r\nAmerican army when they were in the vicinity of it. She was highly\r\nrespected by her neighbours, and visited by the most genteel people of\r\nthe surrounding country. Her situation was one of great delicacy and\r\nconstant apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe wife of a British officer, and connected with the adherents of the\r\ncrown, naturally became an object of political suspicion,\r\nnotwithstanding great circumspection on her part. Under such\r\ncircumstances, a strong sympathy was excited in her behalf. Yet there\r\nwere those among the Whigs who were inclined to enforce the laws of\r\nthe state against her, whereby she would be compelled to withdraw\r\nwithin the lines of the enemy. In this family Colonel Burr became\r\nintimate in 1777, and in 1782 married the widow Prevost.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE TO MRS. PREVOST. [1]\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 8th, 1778.\r\n\r\nA young lady who either is, or pretends to be, in love, is, you know,\r\nmy dear Mrs. Prevost, the most unreasonable creature in existence. If\r\nshe looks a smile or a frown, which does not immediately give or\r\ndeprive you of happiness (at least to appearance), your company soon\r\nbecomes very insipid. Each feature has its beauty, and each attitude\r\nthe graces, or you have no judgment. But if you are so stupidly\r\ninsensible of her charms as to deprive your tongue and eyes of every\r\nexpression of admiration, and not only to be silent respecting her,\r\nbut devote them to an absent object, she cannot receive a higher\r\ninsult; nor would she, if not restrained by politeness, refrain from\r\nopen resentment.\r\n\r\nUpon this principle I think I stand excused for not writing from B.\r\nRidge. I proposed it, however; and, after meeting with opposition in\r\n-----, to obtain her point, she promised to visit the little\r\n\"Hermitage,\" [2] and make my excuse herself. I took occasion to turn\r\nthe conversation to a different object, and plead for permission to go\r\nto France. I gave up in one instance, and she certainly ought in the\r\nother. But writing a letter and going to France are very different,\r\nyou will perhaps say. She objected to it, and all the arguments which\r\na fond, delicate, unmarried lady could use, she did not fail to\r\nproduce against it. I plead the advantage I should derive from it. The\r\npersonal improvement, the connexions I should make. I told her she was\r\nnot the only one on whom fortune did not smile in every instance. I\r\nproduced examples from her own acquaintance, and represented their\r\nsituation in terms which sensibly affected both herself and Lady\r\nC----. I painted a lady full of affection, of tenderness, and\r\nsensibility, separated from her husband, for a series of time, by the\r\ncruelty of the war--her uncertainty respecting his health; the pain\r\nand anxiety which must naturally arise from it. I represented, in the\r\nmost pathetic terms, the disquietudes which, from the nature of her\r\nconnexion, might possibly intrude on her domestic retreat. I then\r\nraised to her view fortitude under distress; cheerfullness, life, and\r\ngayety, in the midst of affliction.\r\n\r\nI hope you will forgive me, my dear little friend, if I produced you\r\nto give life to the image. The instance, she owned, was applicable.\r\nShe felt for you from her heart, and she has a heart capable of\r\nfeeling. She wished not a misfortune similar to yours; but, if I was\r\nresolved to make it so, she would strive to imitate your example. I\r\nhave now permission to go where I please, but you must not forget her.\r\nShe and Lady C---- promise to come to the Hermitage to spend a week or\r\ntwo. Encourage her, and represent the advantage I shall gain from\r\ntravel. But why should I desire you to do what I know your own heart\r\nwill dictate? for a heart so capable of friendship feels its own pain\r\nalleviated by alleviating that of another.\r\n\r\nBut do not suppose that my attention is only taken up with my own\r\naffairs. I am too much attached ever to forget the Hermitage. Mrs.\r\nDuvall, I hope, is recovering; and Kitty's indisposition is that of my\r\nnearest relation. Mrs. de Visme has delicate nerves. Tell me her\r\nchildren are well, and I know she has a flow of spirits, for her\r\nhealth depends entirely on theirs.\r\n\r\nI was unfortunate in not being able to meet with the governor. He was\r\nneither at Elizabethtown, B. Ridge, Princeton, nor Trenton. I have\r\nconsulted with several members of Congress on the occasion. They own\r\nthe injustice, but cannot interfere. The laws of each state must\r\ngovern itself. They cannot conceive the possibility of its taking\r\nplace. General Lee says it must not take place; and if he was an\r\nabsolute monarch, he would issue an order to prevent it.\r\n\r\nI am introduced to the gentleman I wished by General Lee in a very\r\nparticular manner. I cannot determine with certainty what I shall do\r\ntill my arrival in Virginia.\r\n\r\nMake my compliments to Mrs. and Miss De Visme, and believe me, with\r\nthe sincerest friendship,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Peter De Visme, the brother of Mrs. Prevost, was captured at sea,\r\nand made prisoner of war. As she was personally acquainted with\r\nGeneral Washington, she solicited his influence to promote his\r\nexchange, to which the general replied:--\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Middlebrook, 19th May, 1779.\r\n\r\nMADAM,\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the pleasure of obeying the first\r\nemotions in favour of misfortune is not always in our power. I should\r\nbe happy could I consider myself at liberty to comply with your\r\nrequest in the case of your brother, Mr. Peter De Visme. But, as I\r\nhave heretofore taken no direction in the disposal of marine\r\nprisoners, I cannot, with propriety, interfere on the present\r\noccasion, however great the satisfaction I should feel in obliging\r\nwhere you are interested. Your good sense will perceive this, and find\r\na sufficient excuse in the delicacy of my situation.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, madam,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM PATTERSON.\r\n\r\nMorristown, 29th September, 1779.\r\n\r\nDEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nAbout four weeks ago I received a letter from you of the 8th of\r\nAugust, and, a week after, another of the 23d. They came by the way of\r\nMoorestown, from which to Rariton, where I reside. The conveyance is\r\neasy and safe. I cannot point out any mode of sending your letters\r\nbetter than that which you have adopted.\r\n\r\nI was pleased extremely to hear from you, and, indeed, was quite\r\ndisappointed in not hearing from you sooner. I was for a time in\r\nexpectation that you would return into Jersey, as the scene of\r\nmilitary operations was directed to your part of the world, and would\r\nunavoidably drive you from your study and repose. Military operations\r\nare so fluctuating and uncertain as to render it exceedingly difficult\r\nto fix upon a retreat which may not be broken in upon in the course of\r\na campaign. New-Haven bid fair to be the seat of calmness and\r\nserenity, of course well suited for a studious and contemplative mind,\r\nand therefore made choice of as the place of your abode. New-Haven,\r\nhowever, partook of the common calamity; and, in the evolution of\r\nhuman events, from a place of safety and repose, was turned into a\r\nplace of confusion and war.\r\n\r\nYou are not contented, my dear Burr, and why are you not? You sigh for\r\nNew-Jersey, and why do you not return? It is true we are continually\r\nbroken in upon by the sons of tumult and war. Our situation is such\r\nthat the one army or the other is almost constantly with us, and yet\r\nwe rub along with tolerable order, spirit, and content. Oh! that the\r\ndays of peace would once more return, that we might follow what\r\nbusiness, partake of what amusements, and think and live as we please.\r\nAs to myself, I am, my dear Burr, one of the happiest of men. The\r\noffice I hold calls me too frequently, and detains me too long, from\r\nhome, otherwise I should enjoy happiness as full and high as this\r\nworld can afford. It is, as you express it, \"serene, rural, and\r\nsentimental;\" and such, one day, you will _feel_.\r\n\r\n\"You see no company--you partake of no amusements--you are always\r\ngrave.\" Such, too, has been the life that I have lived for months and\r\nyears. I cannot say that it is an unpleasing one. I avoided company;\r\nindeed, I do so still, unless it be the company of chosen friends. I\r\nhave been ever fond of my fireside and study--ever fond of calling up\r\nsome absent friend, and of living over, in idea, past times of\r\nsentimental pleasure. Fancy steps in to my aid, colours the picture,\r\nand makes it delightful indeed. You are in the very frame of mind I\r\nwish you to be; may it continue.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you what has become of Mrs. Prevost's affairs. About two\r\nmonths ago I received a very polite letter from her. She was\r\napprehensive that the commissioners would proceed. It seems they\r\nthreatened to go on. I wrote them on the subject, but I have not heard\r\nthe event. I am at this place, on my way to a superior court in\r\nBergen. If possible, I shall wait on the good gentlewoman. At Bergen I\r\nshall inquire into the state of the matter. It will, indeed, turn up\r\nof course. You shall soon hear from me again. Adieu. May health and\r\nhappiness await you\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe precarious and unsettled state of Colonel Burr's health, in the\r\nautumn of 1779 and the beginning of 1780, was such that he was unable\r\nto adopt and adhere to any regular system of study. Among his most\r\nintimate personal friends was Colonel Robert Troup. He, too, had\r\ndetermined to retire from public service, and was anxious to study in\r\nthe same office with Burr. His letters cast much light on their\r\npursuits at the time they were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 16th January, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy dear Friend,\r\n\r\nWatkins was kind enough to deliver me yours of the 8th of December,\r\nwritten, I presume, at Paramus. I almost envy you the happiness you\r\nhave enjoyed. From the first moment of my acquaintance with Mrs.\r\nPrevost and her sister, I conceived an admiration for them both, which\r\nis much increased by the opinion you entertain of them. How, then, am\r\nI flattered by their polite manner of mentioning my name. To whom am I\r\nindebted but to you, my friend, for this unmerited favour? Surely\r\nthese ladies saw nothing in me at Governor Livingston's which was\r\nworthy of remembrance, unless a terrible noise, which some people call\r\nlaughter, could be worth remembering. With the best intention,\r\ntherefore, to serve me, you have done me an injury, Aaron. I shall be\r\nafraid to see our favourites in the spring, because I shall fall\r\ninfinitely short of their ideas of cleverness. Pray, do you recollect\r\nthe opinion which Judge Candour solemnly pronounced upon us both, in a\r\ncourt of reason held at the Indian King? Why, then, will you expose my\r\nweakness by ascribing to me imaginary excellences? If you persist in\r\nsuch cruel conduct, sir, I will make you feel the weight of my\r\nresentment, by publishing to the world the purity of my esteem for\r\nyour public and private character.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find our plan of studying together appears more and more\r\nrational to you. It really does to me, and I hope we shall follow it.\r\nSince you left Philadelphia, some circumstances have turned up which\r\nrender my office so disagreeable to me that I am determined to resign.\r\n_Vous pouvez compter sur moi_. Besides the disgust I have taken, I am\r\nled to it by ambition, which has a small share of influence over me as\r\nwell as you.\r\n\r\nBut I am desirous of a change in our plan, which I request you to\r\nthink of seriously. I am inclined to believe it would be best for us\r\nto study the law with Mr. Stockton, at Princeton. This, I know, will\r\nsurprise you; but your surprise will be lessened when you hear my\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nThe practice of Connecticut differs so materially from the practice of\r\nNew-York and New-Jersey, that we should lose time by being with Mr.\r\nOsmer. For, after being eighteen months or two years with him, it\r\nwould be necessary to continue nearly the same time in another office,\r\nto get a competent knowledge of the practice. This is a matter of\r\nconsequence, especially as it is my object to qualify myself for\r\npractice as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI have the highest opinion of Mr. Osmer, and, did I intend to follow\r\nthe law in Connecticut, there is no man I would sooner study with. I\r\nbelieve he would ground us well in the knowledge of the dead-letter of\r\nthe law; but I wish to have the practice and the theory accompanying\r\neach other. Mr. Stockton has been polite enough to make me an offer,\r\nand has promised to spare no pains to instruct me. He would be glad to\r\ninstruct you likewise; for I have heard him express himself of you in\r\nthe most friendly manner. I propose to lodge at some substantial\r\nfarmer's house, about a mile from the main road, and have made a\r\nsolemn league and covenant with my own mind to seclude myself from the\r\npleasures of the world. This I know I can do. And have you not as much\r\nphilosophy as I have?\r\n\r\nIt is true, Mr. Stockton has unmarried daughters, and there is a\r\nnumber of genteel families in and near Princeton. But why should we\r\nconnect ourselves with any of them, so as to interrupt our studies?\r\nThey will be entitled to a civil bow from us whenever we meet them;\r\nand, if they expect more, they will be disappointed. Indeed, l shall\r\ntake care to inform them of my intentions, and if they afterwards\r\ncomplain of my want of politeness in not visiting them, it will give\r\nme little uneasiness.\r\n\r\nI entreat you, my dearest and best friend, to reflect on this matter,\r\nand favour me with your answer without a moment's loss of time. My\r\nhappiness, and my improvement in the law, depend entirely upon\r\npursuing my studies with you. The change I now propose is conformable\r\nto the sentiments and wishes of all my friends, particularly of\r\nChancellor Livingston, who is certainly a judge.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention that Mr. Stockton is universally allowed to be one\r\nof the best speakers we ever had in this part of the continent, and it\r\nwill therefore be in his power to teach us the eloquence of the bar,\r\nwhich may be considered as a capital advantage.\r\n\r\nI have communicated my sentiments on this subject more fully to our\r\nmutual friend, Colonel Wadsworth, who will deliver you this letter,\r\nthan I have to you in writing. He will explain them to you, and, I am\r\nsure, will give you his own with the utmost candour and sincerity. I\r\nhave left several messages at the house Dr. ----- lodges when he is in\r\ntown; but cannot get an answer, and see little prospect of getting\r\nyour money unless you write him a dunning letter. I shall leave one\r\nfor him to-morrow, and will endeavour to have the affair settled this\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nI write this at my lodgings, where I have not a single newspaper.\r\nColonel Wadsworth will leave town in the course of an hour; and, if I\r\ncan find time, I will go to the office and collect all I can find.\r\nThere have been none, however, since you left town, which are worth\r\nreading. Wadsworth will tell you all the news I have, which is, that\r\nold Roger Sherman is metamorphosed, by some strange magical power,\r\ninto _a very honest man_.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, and may Dom. Tetard soon have the pleasure of drinking\r\na glass of wine with us both, in his house at Kingsbridge. I mean,\r\nafter the British gentry have left it. I should have written to you\r\nbefore, but I have been waiting these three weeks past for Colonel\r\nWadsworth to leave Philadelphia. He will inform you of the cursed\r\nslavish life I lead at the treasury office. I am obliged to attend it\r\neven on Saturday nights, which places me below the level of a negro in\r\npoint of liberty. Pray present my best respects to Tetard, and assure\r\nhim of my wishes to serve him at all times, and on all occasions.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 14th, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Burr,\r\n\r\nI have resigned my office, and am now preparing to leave Philadelphia\r\nto go to Princeton, agreeable to the plan in my letter by Colonel\r\nWadsworth. This week I expect to finish a little private business I\r\nhave on hand, and, by the latter end of the next, to be settled in a\r\nregular course of study with Mr. Stockton. What think you of this\r\nalteration in the plan we settled? Can you leave Mr. Osmer without\r\ninjury? I assure you, the only motive I have to prefer Stockton is a\r\ndesire to qualify myself for practice as soon as possible. All my\r\nfriends are against my studying in Connecticut, for the reason\r\nmentioned in my last; and they all recommend Stockton to me. I am\r\ntherefore determined to study with him.\r\n\r\nI am very much afraid that Princeton will be disagreeable to you on\r\nmany accounts, and particularly on account of the number of\r\nacquaintances you have in and near it. This is a misfortune, to be\r\nsure; but do as I shall, _neglect them all_; it is matter of perfect\r\nindifference to me whether I affront them or not. My object is to\r\nstudy with the closest attention. I must do it. I have no other\r\nresource.\r\n\r\nPermit me to declare, like a sincere friend, that my happiness is so\r\nintimately connected with yours, that I shall be chagrined to an\r\nextreme if you find it inconvenient to join me. We could be useful to\r\neach other. Besides facilitating each other's progress in the law, we\r\ncould improve ourselves in writing and speaking. In one word--I am\r\nconfident I should acquire as much knowledge in three years with you\r\nas in six years without you. I never was more serious. Come,\r\ntherefore, immediately, and bring Mr. Tetard with you to perfect us in\r\nthe French language, which I have paid little attention to since I\r\nwrote you, and indeed since you left me.\r\n\r\nPray why have you neglected to answer my letter by Colonel Wadsworth?\r\nI suspect something extraordinary is the matter with you. Or are you\r\nso angry as not to think I merit an answer? Whatever your reason was,\r\nlet me request you to favour me with an answer to this by the first\r\nopportunity. If it is sent under cover to Mr. Stockton, it will\r\nperhaps reach me sooner.\r\n\r\nIt is reported, and pretty general believed, that Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nwith the fleet that came from New-York about six weeks ago, has\r\ntouched at Georgia; taken Prevost's troops with him, and gone either\r\nto St. Augustine or the Havannah. This is very important news, if\r\ntrue; but it seems to wait confirmation.\r\n\r\nYour unalterable friend,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\nMiddletown, February 16th, 1780.\r\n\r\nYour friendly letter of September has at length found its way to me. I\r\nam once more a recluse. It accords with my feelings. I should\r\ndoubtless be happier if I enjoyed perfect health and the society of a\r\nfriend _like you_; but why do I say like you? No likeness could\r\ncompensate for the absence of the original.\r\n\r\nI am something at a loss how to regulate my motions for the coming\r\nsummer. The prospect of peace is still distant. It is an object of\r\nimportance with me to be not only secure from alarms, but remote from\r\nthe noise of war. My present situation promises at least those\r\nadvantages. Perhaps yours does equally. Events only can determine.\r\n\r\nMy health, which was till of late very promising, seems to decline a\r\nlittle. This circumstance will oblige me to alter my course of life. I\r\nshall be in your state in May or June, perhaps sooner. If you have a\r\nprospect of tranquillity, I Shall have no thought of returning.\r\nColonel Troup, a worthy, sensible young fellow, and a particular\r\nfriend of mine, wishes to know where I shall prosecute my studies, and\r\nis determined, he says, to be my companion. A gentleman who has been\r\nlong eminent at your bar, and whom we both know perfectly well, had\r\nmade Troup some polite offers of his service as an instructor. He was\r\npleased with the scheme, and as he knew the gentleman was professedly\r\nmy friend, urged me to put myself also under his tuition. I mentioned\r\nto him in a late letter the objections which had been decisive with\r\nme, and I fancy he will view them in the same light. He is the\r\ncompanion I would wish in my studies. He is a better antidote for the\r\nspleen than a ton of drugs. I am often a little inclined to _hypo_.\r\n\r\nMy best respects attend Mrs. Paterson. Speak of her in your letters. I\r\nwould not feel indifferent to one so near to you, even if no personal\r\nacquaintance had confirmed my esteem. You would have heard from me\r\nsooner, but no post has rode this fortnight. I have been pursuing the\r\ntrack you marked out for me, though not with the ardour I could wish.\r\nMy health will bear no imposition. I am obliged to eat, drink, sleep,\r\nand study, as it directs. No such restraint interrupts your bliss. May\r\nyou feel no bonds but those of love and friendship--no rules but those\r\nthat lead to happiness. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 29th February, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nYour favours of the 1st and 5th inst. came to hand last night, and are\r\nboth before me. I am very much indebted to you for your candour in\r\nstating the objections which are against Princeton, as well as Mr.\r\nStockton. I had anticipated them all. They are far from being\r\ngroundless. But my situation was peculiar when I determined to live\r\nwith Mr. Stockton. In my last a principle of delicacy induced me to be\r\nmore reserved than is consistent with the sincerity of our affection\r\nfor each other. Forgive my criminal reserve. I will be plain with you\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nBy a strange kind of contracted system, which pervades all the civil\r\nestablishments of Congress, I was reduced to the necessity of\r\nresigning my office at least six weeks sooner than I expected. Though\r\nI laboured both day and night, with as much drudgery as a negro on a\r\nplantation in the West Indies, the board of treasury did not think\r\nthemselves authorized to report a warrant in my favour for money to\r\nanswer the common demands of living. They confined me to my salary of\r\n_ten thousand dollars_ [3] per annum. Finding that I had not the most\r\ndistant prospect of getting a decent support while I continued in\r\noffice, and that I was obliged to pay four or five thousand dollars\r\nout of my own private purse for _necessaries, I cursed and quit them_\r\nthe beginning of this month.\r\n\r\nBeing thus out of office, I thought it would be prudent to settle\r\nmyself at the law without a moment's delay, both on account of the\r\nheavy expense of living in this city, and the loss of time, which is\r\nof the greatest consequence to me. I did not forget Mr. Paterson when\r\nI gave the preference to Mr. Stockton. The private character of the\r\nformer is infinitely superior to that of the latter, and so is his\r\npublic. But he is immersed in such an ocean of business, that I\r\nimagined it would be out of his power to bestow all the time and pains\r\non our improvement we would wish. Besides, I was afraid of being more\r\nconfined to the drudgery of copying in his office than I ought. This\r\nis inseparable from an office in which there is a good deal done,\r\nhowever well disposed a lawyer may be to promote the interest of his\r\nclerk. You observe that his present office expires next summer. I\r\ngrant it. Yet he may be chosen attorney-general again; and this I\r\nbelieve will be the case, for there is not a man of sufficient\r\nabilities in the state, except him and Morris, to whom the people\r\nwould give the office. Morris, I fancy, will not accept it if offered\r\nto him, as he has lately resigned his seat on the bench; and I will\r\nventure to predict that Paterson will be continued, though against his\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, I feel extreme regret in telling you that I must\r\ngo and sit down at Princeton the latter end of this week at farthest.\r\nThe die is cast. My honour forbids me to act contrary to the\r\nengagement I have entered into with Mr. Stockton. Had I received your\r\nkind letter before my _absolute determination_, I should certainly\r\nhave followed your advice. Our plan, therefore, will be frustrated.\r\nPainful the reflection! You would hurt me exceedingly if you came to\r\nlive at Princeton, and subjected yourself to the inconveniences you\r\nmention, merely to please me.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear your health is mending, and should be still more\r\nhappy if it was unnecessary to make use of the mineral springs in the\r\nClove. I have always suspected that the law would disagree with your\r\ndelicate constitution. It requires the most intense study. Your\r\nambition to excel will stimulate you to the closest application, and I\r\ndread the effects it may produce. You should therefore be cautions.\r\nHealth is a source of more substantial pleasure than the most\r\ncultivated understanding.\r\n\r\nA few days ago Dr. Edwards left a bundle of bills, amounting, as he\r\nsays, to one thousand pounds, at Dr, Rush's for me, to be sent to you.\r\nI have not yet counted it, but I suppose it is right. To-day or\r\nto-morrow I shall leave a receipt for it at Dr. Rash's. I believe I\r\nshall presume so far upon your friendship as to borrow a part of it\r\nfor my own use for about a fortnight. I am much disappointed in\r\nreceiving a small sum to pay my debts in town. I sold two thousand\r\ndollars in certificates to Mr. Duer just before he left town, and he\r\ngave me an order upon a lady for the money. I find she will not be\r\nable to pay it for some time hence, and I am so pressed for cash that\r\nI have written to Duer, at Baskenridge, for the certificates or money\r\nimmediately. I expect an answer every moment; and, till I receive it,\r\nshall consider part of yours as my own. The remainder I shall transmit\r\nyou by the first safe conveyance. I think it would be wrong to trust\r\nthe post with it.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your offer of a horse. The present state of\r\nmy finances is such that I cannot afford to keep one. If I could it\r\nmight detach me from my studies. Beware of temptation, saith the\r\nScripture, and so saith my interest.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have read the king's speech. He makes no mention of his\r\nrebellious subjects in America, or of any allies, and is resolved to\r\nprosecute the war. The debates in the House of Lords, as well as\r\nCommons, on the motion for an address of thanks, were very warm. Lord\r\nNorth, in one of his speeches, makes no scruple of declaring that they\r\nhave no allies to assist them. That they can get none. That the\r\ncombined fleets have a _decided superiority_; and that it would have\r\nbeen highly dangerous for the English fleet to have fought them last\r\nfall. The bills on Spain and Holland sell very fast. They will all be\r\ndisposed of in a very short time. There are large arrivals in Virginia\r\nand Maryland; and there are several vessels below, waiting for the\r\nriver to be cleared of ice, which will be in three or four days. Poor\r\n_continental_ is still going down hill. _Fifty-eight_ was refused\r\nyesterday; and I have no doubt it will be _seventy_ for _one_ before\r\nten days hence. Adieu. As long as you are Aaron Burr, I will be\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR R. ALDEN.\r\n\r\nI intended to have wrote you a letter in answer to your last, but\r\nneither head or heart will enable me at present. Although I am\r\nanswerable for my conduct, yet I cannot govern the animal fluids. I am\r\nso much of a _lunatic thermometer_, that both _moon_ and _atmosphere_\r\nvery much influence my _aerial_ constitution. My brain is subject to\r\nsuch changes, and so much affected by _external_ objects, that I may\r\nbe properly compared to a _windmill_. You may make the similitudes as\r\nyou please. I have not a single sentiment in my head, or feeling in my\r\nheart, that would pay for expressing. At any rate, my mill will not\r\ngrind. What is all this says my friend Aaron? The pleasure I enjoyed\r\nyesterday in feasting in good company, and in a variety of other\r\nagreeables, at the nuptial anniversary of our dear and happy friends,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Thaddeus Burr, has deprived me of that common share of\r\nsensibility which is generally distributed through the days of the\r\nyear, and rather destroyed the equilibrium. I set out for camp the\r\nlast of this week; may I expect letters from my friend? Be assured of\r\nmy warmest friendship, and make me happy by the like assurance, as it\r\nwill afford the sincerest pleasure to,\r\n\r\nYours, with affection,\r\n\r\nR. ALDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\nRariton, April 14th, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your\r\n_dateless_ letter, and returning you my best thanks for it. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Reeve [4] have been so kind as to tarry a night with me. We\r\nendeavoured to prevail upon them to pass a few days with us, and\r\nshould have been happy if we could have succeeded. This letter goes\r\nwith them. That circumstance cannot fail, of making it still more\r\nwelcome to your honest and. benevolent heart.\r\n\r\nI wrote you the latter end of January from the Hermitage, and\r\nintrusted the letter to Mrs. Prevost. It was a mere scrawl. This is of\r\nthe same cast. However, I promise, the very first leisure hour, to\r\ndevote it entirely to you in the letter way. Although I do not write\r\nfrequently to you, yet, believe me, I think frequently of you. Oh,\r\nBurr! may you enjoy health, and be completely happy; as much so as I\r\nam--more I cannot wish you. Nor will you be able to attain high\r\nfelicity until you experience such a union as I do. Mrs. Paterson is\r\nin tolerable health, and gives you her best respects. I wish her\r\nsafely through the month of May, and then I shall be still more happy.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to Jersey I shall certainly see you. If I do not, it\r\nwill be treason against our friendship.\r\n\r\nPeace is distant. There is no prospect of it in the present year. Nor\r\ndo I think that Britain will come to terms while she fancies herself\r\nsuperior on the ocean. The war, however, goes southward, and there is\r\nsome hope that we shall be more in quiet this year than we have been\r\nsince the commencement of hostilities. On the opening of the campaign\r\nwe shall be able to judge better. Adieu.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nPrinceton, April 27th, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI wrote to you yesterday, and happened to put the letter into the\r\npostoffice a little after the post had gone. In that letter I\r\nrequested you to come here as soon as possible, for it was highly\r\nprobable that I should leave Princeton entirely, and determine to\r\nfollow our original plan. The event has confirmed my conjecture. I\r\ncame here from General Morris's yesterday, and exerted all the\r\ninfluence I was master of to get new lodgings, but could not, without\r\nlodging in the town, which would be disagreeable to me on many\r\naccounts. I have now given over all thoughts of staying here; and,\r\nhaving an excellent pretext for changing my ground, I shall write to\r\nMr. Stockton, who is still in Philadelphia, and acquaint him with my\r\nintentions of going away. Nothing is therefore wanting but yourself,\r\nwith a horse and chair, to make me completely happy. I wish to God I\r\ncould push off eastward immediately, but I cannot. I have no horse,\r\nneither is it practicable to borrow or hire one. I must, then, wait\r\nfor you; and I request you, in the most pressing terms, to lose not a\r\nmoment's time in coming for me at General Morris's, about six miles\r\nfrom this, near Colonel Van Dyke's mill, on the road to Somerset,\r\nwhere I shall wait impatiently for you.\r\n\r\nI am extremely uneasy lest this letter should reach you after you have\r\nleft home, and begun your journey northward. In that case I shall be\r\nvery unfortunate; and, to prevent too great a delay, I write to Mr.\r\nReeves at Litchfield, and enclose him a letter for you, and desire him\r\nto forward it to you, wherever you are, with all expedition. I shall\r\nlikewise enclose another for you to Mrs. Prevost, who will be kind\r\nenough to give it to you the moment you arrive there.\r\n\r\nIf we once get together, I hope we shall not be soon parted. It would\r\nafford me the greatest satisfaction to live with you during life. God\r\ngrant our meeting may be soon. You have my best and fervent wishes for\r\nthe recovery of your health, and every other happiness. Adieu.\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nFairfield, 15th May, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BOB,\r\n\r\nI wrote you from this place the 12th inst. This follows close upon it,\r\nthat I may rest assured of your having heard from me.\r\n\r\nI go to-morrow to Middletown, from whence I shall hasten my departure\r\nas much as possible. No trifling concerns should command me a moment;\r\nbut business of importance, and some embarrassments too serious to be\r\nlaughed out of the way, will, I fear, detain me this month. But the\r\nmonth is already gone before you can receive this. I hope your\r\nphilosophy will not have forsaken you. Far from you be gloom and\r\ndespondency. Attune your organs to the genuine ha! ha! 'Tis to me the\r\nmusic of the spheres; the sovereign specific that shall disgrace the\r\nphysician's art, and baffle the virulence of malady. Hold yourself\r\naloof from all engagements, even of the _heart_. We will deliberate\r\nunbiased, that we may decide with wisdom. I form no decision on the\r\nsubject of our studies till I see you.\r\n\r\nI write from the house of our friend Thaddeus, in a world of company,\r\nwho are constantly interrupting me with impertinent questions. Your\r\nsummons came unexpected, and found me unprepared. Nevertheless, my\r\nassiduity shall convince you that you may command\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nAt General Morris's, near Princeton, 16th May, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nI wrote you, about three weeks ago, a very pressing letter, and\r\nrequested you to come for me here as soon as possible. My anxiety to\r\nsee you is extreme, and, lest my letter should have miscarried, I\r\ncannot help troubling you with another. Every thing, my dear Burr, has\r\nsucceeded to my wishes. I have left Mr. Stockton upon the most\r\nfriendly terms imaginable, and I am still at General Morris's to avoid\r\nexpense, but am so situated that I cannot study. I assure you, my\r\nfuture prosperity and happiness in life depends, in a greater measure\r\nthan you may imagine, on my living and studying with you; and the\r\nsooner we get seated in some retired place, where we may live cheaply\r\nand study without interruption, the better. I know myself--I think I\r\nknow you perfectly. I am more deceived than ever I was if we do not\r\nlive happily together, and improve beyond our most sanguine\r\nexpectations. Delay not, therefore, a single moment, my dear Burr, but\r\ncome for me yourself. A horse or a chair without you will be\r\nunwelcome. I want to consult you about several matters of importance\r\nto me before I leave this state. I say leave this state, for our\r\noriginal plan of studying with Mr. Osmer appears the most rational to\r\nme on many accounts.\r\n\r\nI am so much attached to you, my dear Burr, and feel myself so much\r\ninterested in every thing which concerns you, that I believe, and hope\r\nsincerely, it will be many years before we separate if we can once sit\r\ndown together. As long as my slender fortune will permit me to live\r\nwithout business, we will, if you find it agreeable, enjoy the\r\npleasures of retirement. And when we enter on the theatre of the\r\nworld, why not act our parts together? Heaven grant that we may. I\r\nrepeat it again, my dearest friend, lose not a moment's time in coming\r\nfor me. It is painful to trespass so long upon General Morris's\r\nbounty, though he be my friend, and I have not any means of stirring\r\nan inch from him unless I walk. For fear you should not be at\r\nMiddletown, I shall enclose a copy of this letter to Mr. Reeves, and\r\nrequest him to forward it to you immediately if you should not be with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith what pleasure did I receive yours of the 24th ult., at Princeton,\r\nthe other day, when I went to pay Mr. Stockton a visit after his\r\nreturn from Philadelphia. I cordially congratulate you on the\r\nimprovement of your health by rash experiments. May it be as well\r\nestablished as my own, which is perfectly capable of the closest\r\napplication. But I was not a little mortified to find you say nothing\r\nabout your intention to ride to Jersey. Let me entreat you once more\r\nto set off as soon as possible. Every moment is precious, and ought to\r\nbe employed to advantage. I shall wait for you with the greatest\r\nimpatience; and, in the meantime, I am, what I always wish to be,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate and sincere friend,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nSociety-Hall, General Morris's, 23d May, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AARON,\r\n\r\nMy patience is almost exhausted. I have been waiting for you this\r\nmonth past. Here I am, a pensioner upon the bounty of my good friend\r\nGeneral Morris, and am likely to continue so, unless you are kind\r\nenough to come and carry me away. This is the fifth or sixth letter I\r\nhave written you on the subject. What can be the reason of the great\r\ndelay in forwarding letters by the post? Your last was above a\r\nfortnight old before it got to Princeton; and, upon inquiry, Daddy\r\nPlumb informs me the riders are ordered to ride _forty miles_ a day\r\nduring the season. Must I attribute it to the fatality which has\r\nalready separated us, and, I fear, is determined to put an eternal bar\r\nto our junction? Such an event would blast all my hopes of future\r\nhappiness. My dear Aaron, I want words to express my pleasure in\r\nanticipating the satisfaction of retiring from the cares of the world\r\nwith you, and living in all the simple elegance of ancient\r\nphilosophers. We should make a rapid improvement in every branch of\r\nuseful literature; and when we came to act our parts on the theatre of\r\nthe world, we might excite admiration, and, what would be infinitely\r\nmore pleasing to us, we should be better men and better citizens.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Stockton returned from Philadelphia, I communicated to him\r\nmy situation and my intentions. He approved of my determination to go\r\naway, and gave me some advice, which you shall know when you see me.\r\nThus I have left Mr. Stockton without causing the least uneasiness,\r\nand I am now ready to enter upon our old plan, which appears the most\r\nconsistent with our present views. As I said in all my letters to you\r\non the subject, I am here from a principle of economy; but it is\r\ndisagreeable to stay so long as a visitor, and I am therefore obliged\r\nto request you to alter your intention about coming here, and set off\r\nthe moment you receive this. I have no horse, and depend entirely upon\r\nyou. Besides the time we lose by postponing our settlement, I have a\r\nmatter of great importance to us both to communicate to you, that has\r\nno connexion with our studying, and which makes it necessary for me to\r\nsee you immediately.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Stockton is incurable. He cannot survive the summer.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nBaskenridge, June 27th, 1786.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AARON,\r\n\r\nAfter a very disagreeable ride indeed, I came here the day before\r\nyesterday in the afternoon; and yesterday morning, just as I was going\r\nto mount my horse, I was seized with a violent fever, which lasted\r\ntill sunset. This morning I feel much better, though I am exceedingly\r\nweak. In a few minutes I shall take an emetic; after which I suppose\r\nthe bark will be necessary. The fever seems to be of the intermittent\r\nkind, and, I think, is occasioned principally by riding in the hot\r\nsun. I am so agreeably situated here, that I shall stay till I\r\nrecover, which I hope will be in three or four days. The family are\r\nvery polite and attentive to me, and Dr. Cutting, who quarters in the\r\nneighbourhood, is both my physician and apothecary.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Livingstons have inquired in a very friendly manner about\r\nyou, and expect you will wait upon them when you pass this way. Since\r\nI have been here, I have had an opportunity of removing entirely the\r\nsuspicion they had of your courting Miss De Visme. [5] They believe\r\nnothing of it now, and attribute your visits at Paramus to motives of\r\nfriendship for Mrs. Prevost and the family.\r\n\r\nWherever I am, and can with propriety, you may be assured I shall\r\nrepresent this matter in its true light.\r\n\r\nI have obtained a few particulars of -----, which I was before\r\nunacquainted with, and which I cannot forbear communicating. He is the\r\nson of the vice-president of Pennsylvania, who I always understood in\r\nPhiladelphia was a respectable merchant, and I believe is worth a\r\nmoderate fortune, though I am not certain. His family was not ranked\r\nin the genteeler class before the war; but at present may be called\r\nfashionable, or _á la mode_. The girls here think him handsome,\r\ngenteel, and sensible, and say positively he is no longer engaged to\r\nMiss Shippen. He has frequently spoken to them in raptures, latterly\r\nof Miss De Visme, and once declared he was half in love with her. I\r\nhave taken care to touch this string with the greatest delicacy.\r\n\r\nHow is your health? Better or worse? Pray neglect no opportunity of\r\nwriting to me. Present my most respectful compliments to Mrs. Prevost\r\nand the family, and also the ladies on the hill.\r\n\r\nMiss Susan Governor Livingston desires her compliments to you and the\r\ntwo families. So do Susan and Eliza Baskenridge.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PETER COLT. [6]\r\n\r\nWeathersfield, 7th July, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWill you allow me that appellation, who have so long neglected to\r\ninform you of the situation of your affairs left in my hands? But\r\nfigure to yourself the thousand embarrassments that have attended me\r\nin conducting my public concerns _towards a close_, and you will be\r\nled to put a more favourable construction on my conduct than I should\r\notherwise expect.\r\n\r\nMy last informed you of the loss of the _Hawk_, being chased on shore\r\nthe back side of Long Island. It was a few days after she went out on\r\nher last cruise, and before she had any success. Of course, about\r\n£20,000, the amount of her last outfits, were thrown away. I fear this\r\nwill make her die in debt. Though all her goods are either sold or\r\ndivided, yet her accounts are not settled. I wish I could see a\r\ntolerable prospect of their being speedily closed. But the agents are\r\nembarrassed. As soon as I can get her accounts, will inform you of the\r\nstate of this unlucky adventure. There is on hand some clothing, some\r\nduck, and rigging, out of which I hope to raise hard money. What shall\r\nI do with the other articles, a small parcel of glassware and rum, and\r\nthe money arising from the sales of the vessel's sea-coat, &c.? I am\r\nadvised to sell every thing for continental money, at the present\r\ngoing prices, and exchange it for hard. What is the exchange with you?\r\nWith us it is from sixty to seventy for one. Let me know what I am to\r\ndo with your money when I get it into my hands. I have not settled any\r\nof your accounts but Stanley's.\r\n\r\nYour friends are generally well, and wish to hear from you. Miss\r\nH----- has been quite unwell since you left us, as she tells me she\r\nhears you are. You will not be vain when I add, she has more than once\r\nlamented _your ill state of health_, and expressed some fears that it\r\nwas not growing better. The Sallys beg me to make their best wishes\r\nfor your health and happiness acceptable to you. Shall I add, their\r\nlove also?\r\n\r\nFriend Wadsworth has engaged in the supplies for the French navy and\r\ntroops. I think it will keep him employed, and much to his advantage.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nPETER COLT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PETER COLT.\r\n\r\nWeathersfield, July 16th, 1780.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your polite and friendly letter\r\nof the 1st inst. My little family would have been too much elated with\r\nyour attention to them had you not dashed the pleasure with the\r\naccount of your ill state of health. Pray be more attentive to the\r\nrecovery of it, even should it interfere with your study of the law.\r\nLet your diet and exercise be simple and regular; directed by\r\nexperience. The former not too low. It is a good old maxim--be\r\nreligious, but not superstitious. So respecting health, be exactly\r\nattentive, but not whimsical. Excuse the term, for invalids are but\r\ntoo apt to be governed by whim rather than reason and experience.\r\n\r\nEnclosed you have an account current with the agents of the Hawk.\r\nIndeed, take it altogether, it is but a poor adventure. I shall\r\nendeavour the settlement of your account with Friend -----, and remit\r\nyou. In the meantime, it will not be amiss to send me an account of\r\nmoney advanced to him.\r\n\r\nAs to news, must refer you to the newspapers, where you will get a\r\nlarge supply. I wish _our printers_ did not deal so much in the\r\nmarvellous. It is in vain for them to attempt copying Rivington. [7]\r\nThey had better stick to the truth.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nPETER COLT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nRariton, July 18th, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nMr. Paterson went to Brunswick court this morning. The few lines by\r\nDr. Brown are the first I have had from you since I left Paramus;\r\nwhere the other letters you refer to stay, I know not.\r\n\r\nI am charmed with my present situation in every respect. It could not\r\nbe more agreeable to my wishes. I shall have reason to thank you, as\r\nlong as I live, for my change. The man I lodge with is an able\r\nfarmer--has a large house--is fond of me, and is possessed of every\r\nthing a reasonable person could expect or wish for. I study\r\nattentively, and have no interruption whatever. There is an agreeable\r\nneighbourhood in this part of the country, and, when I choose, I can\r\nunbend myself in very genteel company.\r\n\r\nI am reading Wood at present. I have almost done with his 4th chapter,\r\nand am looking over his chapter on courts. I confine my whole\r\nattention to the practice, for reasons I will tell you when we meet. I\r\nam translating Burlamaqui's Politic Law. Reading Robertson's Charles\r\nV., Dalrymple on Feudal Property, and Swift's Works. The morning I\r\ndevote to the law. I am up sometimes before, generally at sunrise.\r\nFrom two to half after three in the afternoon, and from nine to eleven\r\nin the evening, I apply to other matters. I am in a fair way, if\r\npublic affairs will suffer me, to be retired.\r\n\r\nPaterson is the very man we want. He is sensible, friendly, and, as\r\nfar as I am capable of judging, profound in the law. He is to examine\r\nme on Saturday or Monday on what I have read, and I am preparing\r\naccordingly. I have heard him examine Noel yesterday on the practice,\r\nand I find his examinations are critical. In a couple of months I\r\nexpect to be as far advanced in the practice as Noel. I cannot bear\r\nthat he should be before me. It must not, it shall not be.\r\n\r\nMy health is perfectly restored, and I am now as well as ever I was. I\r\nam happy to hear you grow better. May you soon be well enough to join\r\nme. The weather is so intensely hot, and I am so closely engaged in\r\nstudy, that I cannot determine when I shall pay you a visit.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nOn the Rariton, 21st August, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nThe account I have given of my situation is far from a fiction. You\r\nwill find it a pleasing reality when you come here, which I suppose\r\nyou will postpone till you see me, as I have no doubt at present that\r\nthe second division of the French fleet has arrived, with a\r\nre-enforcement of 4000 troops. This event will render it necessary for\r\nme to be ready to move at a moment's warning; and, presuming there\r\nwill be no delay in commencing our operations, I think, in the course\r\nof a fortnight, or three weeks at most, I shall be at Paramus.\r\n\r\nWill your health permit you to join the army? I fear not. Fatigue and\r\nbad weather may ruin it. I confess I am much disappointed in my\r\nopinion of the mineral waters. From your letters, I conclude the stock\r\nof health you have gained since I left you is scarcely perceptible.\r\nSomething else must be tried. Life is precious, and demands every\r\nexertion and sacrifice to preserve it. Mr. Paterson and I have often\r\nspoken together on this subject, and we both agree that a ride to the\r\nsouthward next winter, and a trip to the West Indies in the spring,\r\nwould be of infinite service to you. This might be done with ease in\r\nfive or six months.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paterson is perfectly recovered, and her little girl grows\r\nfinely, and promises to be handsome. Mrs. Paterson often asks about\r\nyou, and seems anxious to have you among us. When you come, remember\r\nto bring with you the book you took with you on our way to Paramus. I\r\nbelieve it is an essay on health. Mrs. Paterson wants it, the idea you\r\ngave me of her is just. She is easy, polite, sensible, and friendly.\r\nPaterson is rather deficient in the graces, but he possesses every\r\nvirtue that enters into the composition of an amiable character.\r\n\r\nI can hardly go out anywhere without being asked a number of questions\r\nabout you. You seem to be universally known and esteemed. Mr. Morris's\r\nfamily are exceedingly particular in their inquiries concerning your\r\nhealth. It would be easier for you to conceive, than for me to tell\r\nyou, how much they like you. They insist upon our paying them a visit\r\nas soon as you are settled here, which I have promised, on your part\r\nas well as my own.\r\n\r\nLet me entreat you to avoid engaging any of your French books in\r\nConnecticut, especially Chambaud's Exercises, to any person whatever.\r\nI, and perhaps you, will stand in need of them all.\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to the good family for their favourable\r\nsentiments, which, as I said once before, must proceed more from\r\naffection to you than what they find meritorious in me. I am certain,\r\nhowever, that their esteem for me cannot exceed mine for them, and\r\nthis you will be kind enough to hint to them when you present my\r\nrespectful compliments. Assure Dom. Tetard of my friendship for him,\r\nand fixed determination to use all endeavours to metamorphose him into\r\na Crassus after the war is ended.

It would have given me pleasure to have shown\r\nhim every mark of attention and esteem in my power.\r\n\r\nI dare say you count it an age since I have written you; and, indeed,\r\nI must confess that the time has been long. Your good-nature, however,\r\nwill induce you to forgive me, although I cannot expect it from your\r\njustice. I hope the water you drink will prove medicinal, and soon\r\nrestore you to health; although I am more disposed to think that it\r\nwill take time, and be effected gradually. Persons indisposed (I speak\r\nfrom experience) are generally impatient to become well, and that very\r\nimpatience has a natural tendency to prevent it. Do not be restless,\r\nmy dear Burr; nor think that, because you do not get well in a month,\r\nor in a season, you will not get well at all. The heat of this summer\r\nhas been intense, nor is it as yet much abated. Perhaps that too may\r\nhave had some effect upon you. The hale and hearty could scarcely bear\r\nup under it. May health soon visit you, my good friend.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paterson is well. Our little pledge, a girl, Burr, [1] has been\r\nmuch indisposed, but is at present on the mending hand. I am from home\r\nas usual. My official duty obliges me to be so. I grow quite uneasy\r\nunder it, and I find ease and retirement necessary for the sake of my\r\nconstitution, which has been somewhat broken in upon by unceasing\r\nattention to business. The business has been too much for me. I have\r\nalways been fond of solitude, and, as it were, of _stealing_ along\r\nthrough life. I am now sufficiently fond of domestic life. I have\r\nevery reason to be so. Indeed, I know no happiness but at home. Such\r\none day will be your situation.\r\n\r\nMy compliments to the family at the Hermitage. I shall write you\r\nbefore I leave this place.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\nMorristown, 31st August, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nIt is now near the midnight hour, and yet, late as it is, I could not\r\nacquit myself to my conscience if I had not again written you before I\r\nleft this place, which will be early tomorrow. My life is quite in the\r\nmilitant style--one continued scene of warfare. From this place I go\r\ndown to the Supreme Court at Trenton, which will be on Tuesday next,\r\nand the Tuesday after that I shall return once more to Morristown, and\r\nwhen I shall leave it will be uncertain. I rejoice when the hour of\r\nrest comes up, and sicken at the approach of day. Business fairly\r\nbears me down. The truth is, that I am tired of writing, tired of\r\nreading, tired of bustling in a crowd, and, by fits, heartily tired of\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI hope you go on gaining strength, and that you will in a little while\r\nget the better of your disorder. The mind and the body affect each\r\nother extremely. To a person in your state, hilarity, cheerfullness, a\r\nserene flow of spirits, are better than all the drugs in a doctor's\r\nshop. Gentle exercise is of infinite service. I hope you are not\r\nwanting in any of these. If you are, I cannot easily pardon you,\r\nbecause they are all within your power.\r\n\r\nMake my compliments acceptable to the family at the Hermitage. I have\r\na high regard for them, and sincerely wish their happiness. I really\r\npity and admire Mrs. Prevost. Her situation demands a tear; her\r\nconduct and demeanour the warmest applause. Tell Mrs. Prevost that she\r\nmust remember me among her friends; and that I shall be happy to\r\nrender her all the service in my power.\r\n\r\nSince I have been at this place I have had a letter from Mrs.\r\nPaterson, who is well. Our little girl, who was indisposed when I left\r\nhome, is not worse. I flatter myself I shall find her better when I\r\nreturn. Alas, that I cannot be more at home. A husband and a parent\r\nhave a thousand tendernesses that you know nothing of. Adieu, my dear\r\nBurr; live and be happy.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PATERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL TROUP.\r\n\r\nMorristown, October 23d, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST FRIEND,\r\n\r\nI want words to express the pleasure I feel at the receipt of yours of\r\nthe 22d, by the boy who came for your horse. It relieved me from a\r\nburden which had sunk my spirits lower than I recollect them to have\r\nbeen by any calamity I have met with during the war. My imagination\r\nhad crowded my mind with a thousand melancholy reflections from the\r\nmoment I got your letter by Dr. Cutting, who, like a modern well-bred\r\ngentleman, left it at my lodgings only three days ago. Some evil\r\ngenius certainly interrupts our correspondence. I write letters\r\nwithout number, and yet you seldom hear from me, and when you do, the\r\nletter is as old as if it had come from the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. It is exactly the case with yours.\r\n\r\nMr. Paterson has been more unfortunate than I. He has often complained\r\nof your neglect, as he thought it; but I informed him of the fate my\r\nletters shared, and he was easy. However, he desired me last night to\r\ngive you a hint, that he had lately written you several long letters\r\nwithout receiving an answer to either. He is now at Princeton,\r\nattending court. I shall forward your letter that accompanied mine to\r\nhim by a safe conveyance. Paterson really loves you with the tenderest\r\naffection, and can scarcely speak of your state of health without\r\nshedding a friendly tear. As God is my judge, I could not forbear\r\nshedding several when I read yours by Dr. Cutting, which is the first\r\nI have had from you in near five weeks. I was afraid all farther\r\nattempts to recover your health, so as to qualify you to execute our\r\nplan, would be fruitless. In short, I thought you on the brink of\r\neternity, ready to take your final farewell of this wrangling world.\r\nThe critical situation of your sister increased my distress, and\r\nextinguished every hope. How much more happy should I be if your\r\nsister's health took the same fortunate turn. Your ride to Litchfield\r\nmust be doubly agreeable, as it will tend to establish your health and\r\nbetter hers.\r\n\r\nI must now communicate to you a disagreeable piece of news respecting\r\nmyself. It shows how rare it is to find a man of real disinterested\r\nbenevolence. Sears and Broome, I understand by Mr. Noel, who returned\r\nfrom Philadelphia a few days ago, have protested the bill I drew upon\r\nthem last summer. Colonel Palfrey bought it, and has it returned to\r\nhim, for what reasons I cannot say positively, but I suspect they are\r\ndetermined not to assist me, although they were lavish of their offers\r\nwhen they supposed I never would be reduced to the necessity of\r\naccepting them. Such conduct is characteristic of excessive meanness\r\nof spirit, and I confess I am deceived in my opinion of them most\r\negregiously. True it is, that instances of this kind of behaviour\r\noften occur in our intercourse with mankind; but, from the fortunes\r\nthese men have made since the war, and the frequent reports of their\r\ngenerosity, I was led to imagine there was something more than mere\r\nidle compliment and ostentatious parade in their offers. I was\r\ndeceived, and I hope it will be the last time. This affair has wounded\r\nmy pride so sensibly, that I shall be extremely cautious in future. I\r\nmust and will endeavour to adopt some mode of drawing supplies from my\r\ncertificates, which will be three years old next spring, and therefore\r\nought to be taken up by Congress By the table of depreciation\r\npublished by Congress to regulate the payment of the principal of\r\ntheir certificates, I am entitled to three hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nat the very lowest calculation, and this sum in specie.\r\n\r\nWhen you come here you must exert all your abilities in finance, to\r\nmake me no longer dependant upon the bounty of friends; or rather, I\r\nshould say, your bounty, for you are the only person I have borrowed\r\nmoney of. Till that time, my dear friend, can you keep me above water,\r\nand do justice to yourself? Will you be able to extricate me from the\r\ndifficulties attending this bill? In plain terms, can you spare me the\r\namount of it? My reputation suffers by having the bill protested, and\r\nI must, in a short time, send the money to Colonel Palfrey, for I am\r\npersuaded I have no farther ground to expect the least assistance from\r\nSears and Broome. Fail not, by any means, to write me on this subject\r\nbefore you leave Paramus, and be careful how you send the letter.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing but your health and my poverty that retards my\r\nprogress in study. They are fruitful sources of disquietude. When I\r\nlay me down to sleep, they often prevent me from closing my eyes. When\r\nI look into a book, they present a variety of melancholy images to my\r\nimagination, and unfit me for improvement In all other respects I am\r\nsituated to my wishes: Paterson treats me as a bosom friend. He has\r\ngone so far as to press me in the warmest terms to command his purse.\r\nHow I shall be able to requite your friendship is a matter beyond my\r\npenetration. I declare, before the Searcher of all hearts, that I\r\nconsider your happiness and welfare as inseparable from my own, and\r\nthat no vicissitudes of fortune, however prosperous or calamitous they\r\nmay be, will ever tear you from my heart. Circumstanced as I now am,\r\nwords are the only proofs I can give you of my gratitude and\r\naffection. Time will prove whether they are the cant of hypocrisy or\r\nthe language of esteem.\r\n\r\nI lent your horse to Mrs. Paterson about a week ago, to carry her to\r\nElizabethtown to see her brother, who was to meet her there from\r\nNew-York; and disappointments in not seeing him, from day to day, have\r\ndetained her much longer than was expected, and it is probable that\r\nshe will not return until Thursday next; I have therefore sent the boy\r\ndown to Elizabethtown, or, more properly, shall send him in the\r\nmorning, with Mr. Noel's horse, which will answer full as well in the\r\nwagon. This change will produce no inconvenience at all, and is better\r\nthan to detain the boy till Mrs. Paterson returns. She was exceedingly\r\nwell when she left home, and so was her little girl, which is\r\nhandsome, good-tempered, fat, and hearty. I am very particular in\r\npresenting _her_ your respects, and _she_ is as particular in\r\ninquiring about you.\r\n\r\nBring all the French books you can from Connecticut, particularly\r\nChambaud's Exercises, and all the other elementary books you have. I\r\nshould be fond of having the perusal of Rousseau's Social Compact, if\r\nyou can borrow it of Mrs. Prevost for me. I am quite rusty in the\r\nFrench, for I have neglected it totally for two or three months. The\r\nbusiness of the office has engrossed so much of my attention, that I\r\nhave not lately read any other book but Blackstone. I am still in the\r\nthird volume. I digest thoroughly as I advance. I have unravelled all\r\nthe difficulties of the practice, and can do common business with\r\ntolerable dexterity.\r\n\r\nThe horse will be delivered to you without a saddle. Gales, a young\r\nfellow who was studying with Mr. Paterson, requested me to lend it to\r\nhim to ride as far as Newark last August, and he ran off to New-York,\r\nand I never could get the saddle again. This piece of villany I could\r\nnot foresee, and it surprised almost as much as Arnold's. The grass\r\nhas been very short, and I fancy the horse will be leaner than you\r\nexpect. He is a most excellent saddle-horse.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to hear Mrs. Prevost and her sister are unwell.\r\nRemember me to them in the most friendly manner. Give my compliments\r\nalso to Dr. Latimer, and all friends in the army near you. Don't\r\nforget Mrs. De Visme, the children, Dom. Tetard, and the family on the\r\nhill, although I hear they are strongly prejudiced against me. Mrs.\r\nJudith Watkins, as you well know, has spoken maliciously. She is far\r\nfrom being your friend. Every thing that passed one day at dinner in\r\nconfidence respecting our reception at her house, has been told to her\r\nand her husband, with no small exaggerations, by some person of the\r\ncompany. Governor Bill Livingston related some particulars that\r\nastonished me, and added, that he and Mr. and Mrs. Watkins thought it\r\ncruel in you to put such an unfair construction upon Watkins's\r\nbehaviour to us. All this talk is beneath our notice. What I said to\r\nBill was sufficient to erase any unfavourable impression from a candid\r\nmind. If it has not produced that effect, any further attempt to\r\nrefute the calumny will only serve to confirm it.\r\n\r\nMrs. P. Livingston is here, and desires her respects to you. She was\r\nglad to hear of the prospect you have of growing hearty. She is an\r\namiable woman, and loves you. Your friend,\r\n\r\nROBERT TROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding correspondence contains in itself a tolerable history of\r\nColonel Burr's situation and employment from the summer of 1779 until\r\nthe autumn of 1780. After retiring from the army, he suffered most\r\nseverely from ill health--that ill health was, in a great degree,\r\nproduced by the fatigues and exposure on the 27th and 28th of June,\r\n1779, at the battle of Monmouth. His constitution was feeble, and had\r\nbeen shattered by his unparalleled vigilance in the winter of 1778-79,\r\nwhile commanding the advanced post in Westchester. But the battle of\r\nMonmouth seemed to have given it the finishing stroke.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Judge Paterson and Colonel Troup afford the best\r\nevidence of his ill health, and of their affectionate devotion to him\r\nas friends. They are given at some length, because they present rare\r\nand extraordinary examples of fidelity in friendship. Both these\r\ngentlemen preceded Colonel Burr to the tomb. Both continued to\r\nrespect, to esteem, and to love him, to their last hour. Their\r\ncharacter requires no panegyric. Colonel Troup lived until the year\r\n1832. In manhood, for more than half a century, he venerated Colonel\r\nBurr for his genius, his talents, his chivalry, his intrepidity of\r\ncharacter, his disinterestedness, his generosity. He deplored his\r\nweaknesses, and abhorred his vices. But when he viewed the whole man,\r\nfrom youth to more than threescore and ten years, he loved and\r\nrespected him. Both these distinguished citizens, as politicians, were\r\nopposed to Colonel Burr from the year 1788 until the close of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1780, Colonel Burr commenced the study of law with\r\nJudge Paterson, who resided at that time on the Rariton, about twenty\r\nmiles from Brunswick, in New-Jersey. Here he remained till the spring\r\nof 1781. The judge was a man governed by fixed and settled rules. In\r\nthe application of these rules Colonel Burr found that his study of\r\nthe law would require much more time to prepare him for an examination\r\nthan he was willing to devote. He concluded that there must be a\r\nshorter mode to get at the mechanical or practical part; and, having\r\ndetermined to make the experiment, he left the office of Judge\r\nPaterson.\r\n\r\nFrom New-Jersey, in the spring of 1781, he removed to Haverstraw, then\r\nin Orange county, State of New-York. Residing at this place was Thomas\r\nSmith, Esq., formerly of the city of New-York, and brother to William\r\nSmith, the king's attorney-general. Thomas Smith had a good law\r\nlibrary, which had been removed from the city into the Highlands for\r\nsafety. With Smith, Colonel Burr made an arrangement to study on a\r\nplan of his own. By the contract, for a specified sum to be paid,\r\nSmith was to devote certain portions of his time to Burr. At these\r\ninterviews, he was to answer such questions as Burr propounded. The\r\nanswers were taken down in writing, and formed the basis of additional\r\ninterrogatories; while, at the same time, they aided in directing his\r\nattention to those legal points or authorities which were necessary\r\nfor him to examine or read. During the time he remained at Haverstraw,\r\nhe studied from sixteen to twenty hours a day.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1780, Major Andre, of the British army, was in\r\ncorrespondence with Mrs. Arnold (the wife of General Arnold), under a\r\npretext of supplying her, from the city of New-York, with millinery\r\nand other trifling articles of dress. On the 23d of September, 1780,\r\nMajor Andre was captured, and the treason of the general discovered.\r\nWhen this news reached West Point, Mrs. Arnold became, apparently,\r\nalmost frantic. Her situation excited the sympathy of some of the most\r\ndistinguished officers in the American army. Mrs. Arnold, having\r\nobtained from General Washington a passport, and permission to join\r\nher husband in the city of New-York, left West Point, and on her way\r\nstopped at the house of Mrs. Prevost, in Paramus, where she stayed one\r\nnight. On her arrival at Paramus the frantic scenes of West Point were\r\nrenewed, and continued so long as strangers were present. Mrs. Prevost\r\nwas known as the wife of a British officer, and connected with the\r\nroyalists. In her, therefore, Mrs. Arnold could confide.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were left alone Mrs. Arnold became tranquillized, and\r\nassured Mrs. Prevost that she was heartily sick of the theatrics she\r\nwas exhibiting. She stated that she had corresponded with the British\r\ncommander--that she was disgusted with the American cause and those\r\nwho had the management of public affairs--and that, through great\r\npersuasion and unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the\r\ngeneral into an arrangement to surrender West Point to the British.\r\nMrs. Arnold was a gay, accomplished, artful, and extravagant woman.\r\nThere is no doubt, therefore, that, for the purpose of acquiring the\r\nmeans of gratifying an inordinate vanity, she contributed greatly to\r\nthe utter ruin of her husband, and thus doomed to everlasting infamy\r\nand disgrace all the fame he had acquired as a gallant soldier at the\r\nsacrifice of his blood. Mrs. Prevost subsequently became the wife of\r\nColonel Burr, and repeated to him these confessions of Mrs. Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe preceding statement is confirmed by the following anecdote. Mrs.\r\nArnold was the daughter of Chief-justice Shippen, of Pennsylvania. She\r\nwas personally acquainted with Major Andre, and, it is believed,\r\ncorresponded with him previous to her marriage. In the year 1779-80,\r\nColonel Robert Morris resided at Springatsbury, in the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia, adjoining Bush Hill. Some time previous to Arnold's\r\ntaking command of West Point, he was an applicant for the post. On a\r\nparticular occasion Mrs. Arnold was dining at the house of Colonel\r\nMorris. After dinner, a friend of the family came in, and\r\ncongratulated Mrs. Arnold on a report that her husband was appointed\r\nto a different, but more honourable command. The information affected\r\nher so much as to produce hysteric fits. Efforts were made to convince\r\nher that the general had been selected for a preferable station. These\r\nexplanations, however, to the astonishment of all present, produced no\r\neffect. But, after the treason of Arnold was discovered, the family of\r\nColonel Morris entertained no doubt that Mrs. Arnold was privy to, if\r\nnot the negotiator for, a surrender of West Point to the British, even\r\nbefore the general had charge of the post.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1781 Colonel Burr left Haverstraw and went to Albany,\r\nwith a determination to make an effort to be admitted to the bar. He\r\ncontinued his studies with the most untiring industry. He had his own\r\napartments and his own library, sleeping, when he did sleep, in a\r\nblanket on the floor.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr's liberality in pecuniary matters had tended to impair\r\nhis private fortune. No man possessed a more benevolent heart. The\r\nfollowing letter presents one case out of many which might be\r\nenumerated, evincing his generosity, and the delicate manner in which\r\nhe could confer a favour. Major Alden had become embarrassed in his\r\ncircumstances, and was greatly at a loss for a profession, at the\r\napproaching close of the war, by which he might acquire a decent\r\nsupport. These reflections rendered him gloomy and desponding. At\r\nlength he unbosomed himself to Colonel Burr, who thus replies to his\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR R. ALDEN.\r\n\r\nRariton, February 15th, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIf it will solace your woes to know there is a heart that feels them\r\nas its own, that heart is mine. The thwarts of delicacy, which you\r\nwould exclude from the catalogues of distress, are certainly the\r\nkeenest humanity can feel. I know their force. I have felt them in all\r\ntheir pungency.\r\n\r\nA want of uniformity in the mode and object of my pursuit has been\r\nlong my misfortune, and has, I fear, been yours. There is a\r\npersevering firmness that will conquer embarrassment, and, aided with\r\nthe secret smile of an approving conscience, cannot fail to put us\r\nabove the power of adversity. Thus \"we shall shun misfortunes, or\r\nshall learn to bear them.\"\r\n\r\nI have ever found the moment of indecision to be the moment of\r\ncompletest anguish. When our resolutions are taken with determined\r\nfirmness, they engross the mind and close the void of misery. Yes, my\r\nfriend, save the pang of sympathy, I am happy. These are my halcyon\r\ndays. Let us taste them together. We shall mutually heighten their\r\nrelish. Let us rescue some moments of rational enjoyment from the\r\nwreck of impetuous time. Friendship shall smooth the rugged path of\r\nscience, and virtue cheer the way.\r\n\r\nIf law is your object, this situation is favourable to the pursuit.\r\nYou shall have access to the library and office, without the customary\r\nexpense. Your _ostensible reason_ for coming here shall be to pursue\r\nyour studies with me, under my friend Mr. Paterson. The two boys [2] I\r\nwish you to instruct are of the sweetest tempers and the softest\r\nhearts. A frown is the severest punishment they ever need. Four hours\r\na day will, I think, be fully sufficient for their instruction. There\r\nare hours enough left for study--as many as any one can improve to\r\nadvantage; and these four will be fully made up to you by the\r\nassistance you will derive from such of us as have already made some\r\nsmall progress.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible, we live together. At any rate, you shall live near\r\nme; we shall at least meet every day, or oftener, if we please.\r\nNothing will interrupt us. We will regulate our own amusements and\r\npursuits. Here are no expensive diversions of any kind. Your salary\r\nshall be a genteel maintenance in such a situation. You shall have\r\nsixty pounds, New-York currency, which is more than I expend here. You\r\nwill find it impossible to spend a farthing except board and clothing.\r\nIf, from this short sketch, you think the situation adapted to your\r\nviews, of which I feel a pleasing assurance, acquaint me immediately,\r\nthat I may prepare for your reception.\r\n\r\nI purpose bringing the boys here the beginning of April. Be here by\r\nthat time, if possible. Get Mr. Thaddeus Burr to enclose your letter\r\nto Loudon the printer, who will be careful to forward it to me. How\r\ncould I write to you How divine your residence? Never again harbour,\r\nfor a moment, a surmise that derogates from my sincerity.\r\n\r\nMy health is nearly established. I have not enough to despise the\r\nblessing, but enough to relish every enjoyment of life. Adieu, my\r\nfriend; may that cheerfullness of which you have been robbed return,\r\nand be as permanent as your merit or my affection.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THOMAS SMITH.\r\n\r\nHaverstraw, 1st March, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe preparations at New-York look this way, and that inclines me to\r\nseek an asylum in New-Jersey, any part of which I believe will be\r\nsafe, if Hudson's river is the object of the enemy. If I could get\r\nMrs. De Visme's place, it would be most agreeable to Mrs. Smith. A few\r\nweeks will determine me, and then I shall be in a situation to give\r\nyou and Colonel Troup every assistance in my power. As it is your\r\nobject to fit yourselves as soon as possible for admission to the bar,\r\nwithout submitting to the drudgery of an attorney's office, in which\r\nthe advancement of the student is but too often a secondary\r\nconsideration, I should cheerfully devote a sufficient part of my time\r\nto lead you through the practice of the law in all its parts; and make\r\nno doubt, with close application on your part, I should be able in a\r\nshort time to introduce you to the bar, well qualified to discharge\r\nthe duties of the profession, with honour to yourselves, and safety to\r\nyour clients.\r\n\r\nMy library is now in a situation to be removed. Two boxes are missing,\r\nand I fear have fallen a sacrifice to the liberty of the times. I only\r\nwait till the roads will permit me to remove the remainder down, as I\r\nthink my books by no means safe where they now are, if the forts\r\nshould be attacked.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this period Colonel Burr was closely engaged in his studies. His\r\nconstitution was somewhat renovated. His correspondence now became\r\nlimited, and was principally confined to Mrs. Prevost. Here again the\r\npeculiarity already referred to was in full operation. The greater\r\npart of this correspondence is in cipher. But portions of it that are\r\nnot thus written are highly interesting, and give evidence that Mrs.\r\nPrevost possessed a cultivated mind. Her health was very feeble, and\r\ncontinued so, after she became the wife of Colonel Burr, until her\r\ndecease. Some extracts from her letters will be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. PREVOST.\r\n\r\nLitchfeld, February 12th, 1781\r\n\r\nI am happy that there is a post established for the winter. I shall\r\nexpect to hear from you every week. My ill health will not permit me\r\nto return your punctuality. You must be contented with hearing once a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nYour opinion of Voltaire pleases me, as it proves your judgment above\r\nbeing biased by the prejudices of others. The English, from national\r\njealousy and enmity to the French, detract him. Divines, with more\r\njustice, as he exposes himself to their censure. It is even their duty\r\nto contemn his tenets; but, without being his disciple, we may do\r\njustice to his merit, and admire him as a judicious, ingenious author.\r\n\r\nI will not say the same of your system of education. Rousseau has\r\ncompleted his work. The indulgence you applaud in Chesterfield is the\r\nonly part of his writings I think reprehensible. Such lessons from so\r\nable a pen are dangerous to a young mind, and ought never to be read\r\ntill the judgment and heart are established in virtue. If Rousseau's\r\nghost can reach this quarter of the globe, he will certainly haunt you\r\nfor this scheme--'tis striking at the root of his design, and\r\ndestroying the main purport of his admirable production. Les\r\nfoiblesses de l'humanité, is an easy apology; or rather, a license to\r\npractise intemperance; and is particularly agreeable and flattering to\r\nsuch practitioners, as it brings the most virtuous on a level with the\r\nvicious. But I am fully of opinion that it is a much greater chimera\r\nthan the world are willing to acknowledge. Virtue, like religion,\r\ndegenerates to nothing, because it is convenient to neglect her\r\nprecepts. You have, undoubtedly, a mind superior to the contagion.\r\n\r\nWhen all the world turn envoys, Chesterfield will be their proper\r\nguide. Morality and virtue are not necessary qualifications--those\r\nonly are to be attended to that tend to the public weal. But when\r\nparents have no ambitious views, or rather, when they are of the more\r\nexalted kind, when they wish to form a happy, respectable member of\r\nsociety--a firm, pleasing support to their declining life, Emilius\r\nshall be the model. A man so formed must be approved by his Creator,\r\nand more useful to mankind than ten thousand modern beaux.\r\n\r\nIf the person whose kind partiality you mention is Paterson, I confess\r\nmyself exceedingly flattered, as I entertain the highest opinion of\r\nthe perspicuity of his judgment. Say all the civil things you please\r\nfor his solicitous attention to my health. But if it should be Troup,\r\nwhich I think more probable, assure him of my most permanent\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. THEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\nLitchfield, 6th March, 1781.\r\n\r\n----Where can ----- be? Poor suffering soul; worthy a better fate.\r\nHeaven preserve him for his own sake; for his distressed mother's. I\r\npity her from my heart, and lament my inability to alleviate her\r\nsorrows. I invoke a better aid. May her \"afflicted spirit find the\r\nonly solace of its woes\"--Religion, Heaven's greatest boon to man; the\r\nonly distinction he ought to boast. In this, he is lord of the\r\ncreation; without it, the most pitiable of all created things.\r\n\r\nHow strangely we pass through life! All acknowledge themselves mortal\r\nand immortal; and yet prefer the trifles of to-day to the treasures of\r\neternity. Piety teaches resignation. Resignation without piety loses\r\nits beauty, and sinks into insensibility. Your beautiful quotation is\r\nworth more than all I can write in a twelvemonth. Continue writing on\r\nthe subject. It is both pleasing and improving. The better I am\r\nacquainted with it, the more charms I find. Worlds should not purchase\r\nthe little I possess. I promise myself many happy hours dedicated at\r\nthe shrine of religion,\r\n\r\nYours, affectionately,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. THEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\nLitchfield, May, 1781.\r\n\r\nOur being the subject of much inquiry, conjecture, and calumny, is no\r\nmore than we ought to expect. My attention to you was ever pointed\r\nenough to attract the observation of those who visited the house. Your\r\nesteem more than compensated for the worst they could say. When I am\r\nsensible I can make you and myself happy, I will readily join you to\r\nsuppress their malice. But, till I am confident of _this_, I cannot\r\nthink of our union. Till then I shall take shelter under the roof of\r\nmy dear mother, where, by joining stock, we shall have sufficient to\r\nstem the torrent of adversity.\r\n\r\nYou speak of my spirits as if they were at my command, or depressed\r\nonly from perverseness of temper. In these you mistake. Believe me,\r\nyou cannot wish their return more ardently than I do. I would this\r\nmoment consent to become a public mendicant, could I be restored to\r\nthe same tranquillity of mind I enjoyed this time twelvemonth. The\r\ninfluence my letters may have on your studies is imaginary. The idea\r\nis so trite that I ask in hopes it was worn from your mind. My last\r\nyear's trials are vouchers. I was always writing with a view to please\r\nyou, and as often failed in the attempt. If a desire for my own\r\nhappiness cannot restore me to myself, pecuniary motives never can. I\r\nwish you to study for your own sake; to ensure yourself respect and\r\nindependence; to ensure us the comforts of life, when Providence\r\ndeigns to fit our hearts for the enjoyment. I shall never look forward\r\nwith confidence till your pride extends to that. I had vainly\r\nflattered my self that pride was inseparable to true love. In yours I\r\nfind my error; but cannot renounce my idea of its being a necessary\r\nsupport _to_, and the only security _for_, permanent affection.\r\n\r\nYou see by the enclosed how ready my friends are to receive you, and\r\npromote your interest. I wish you may be fortunate in executing aunt\r\nClark's business. My health and spirits are neither better nor worse\r\nthan when you left me. I thank you for your attention to Bird's\r\nprescription.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. THEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\nSharon, September 11th, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy friend and neighbour, Mr. Livingston, will have the pleasure of\r\npresenting you this. You will find him quite the gentleman, and worthy\r\nyour attention. Enclosed is a letter to my sister, which must be\r\ndelivered by yourself. You know my reasons too well to infer from my\r\ncaution that I entertain the least doubt of Mr. Livingston's\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Tetard is gone to the manor, summoned by Mrs. Montgomery, on\r\npretence of his being the only surviving witness to the general's\r\nwill. The business that was to have detained him but a few days has\r\nkept him these six weeks. I cannot account for his delay, unless his\r\nextravagant encomiums on the progress of a friend of yours has proved\r\na stimulation to those of superior talents. He exaggerates exceedingly\r\nin extolling his pupils. Those whose expectations are raised from his\r\ndescription must prepare themselves for disappointment.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Reeve were well a few days ago. She rides every morning\r\nto visit the boy, and returns before breakfast. I fear they will\r\ndisappoint me in the promised visit.\r\n\r\nWe were obliged to Dr. Cutting for the most pleasing account of your\r\nhealth and spirits. Also, of your great progress in law. Judge Hobart\r\nexpects Colonels Burr and Troup will make his suite to the October\r\ncourt, where he hopes to usher them, with all the eclat due to their\r\nmerit. He counts the weeks, which he has now reduced to five. While\r\nthe warmth of friendship animates his countenance, his heart swells\r\nwith pride at the honour of patronising two such characters. He must\r\nnot be disappointed; this must be the route, or he will believe\r\nhimself slighted. I am obliged to his zeal, as it will procure us the\r\npleasure of seeing you. The sight of an old acquaintance is quite a\r\nphenomenon. I am not surprised that genuine hospitality is fled to\r\ncottages. You will find it à la rustique chez votre amie.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA PREVOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR R. ALDEN.\r\n\r\nFairfield, 26th February, 1781.\r\n\r\nDEAR BURR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 15th inst. pleases me. You have a heart that feels:\r\na heart susceptible of tender friendship. Life has not a single charm\r\nto compare with such sensations. You know too well how to excite such\r\nemotions. Happy for us. These expel the keenest pangs. There is no\r\nsuch thing as real happiness. At best, it is but a delusion. We make\r\nour own pleasures as we do our troubles. Friendship will heighten the\r\none and moderate the other.\r\n\r\nI have been tortured with the anxiety of suspense. It has given me the\r\nmost poignant distress. It disordered my mind; at times, almost drove\r\nme to despair. Some of my friends saw the effect, but could not\r\nconjecture the cause. You alone could penetrate the feelings of my\r\nheart; you alone are in possession of that evidence which will convict\r\nme of my weakness; my want of fortitude. I dare intrust you. I feel\r\nthe influence of your friendship. To a heart like yours, this will\r\nprove the sincerity and affection of mine. I bid adieu to camp, having\r\ncompleted my business, with my thanks to our worthy commander-in-chief\r\nfor his attention to my character. The discharge he gave me equalled\r\nmy wishes and exceeded my expectations. I have enjoyed the most\r\nrational satisfaction for three days past. I have commenced student.\r\nDr. Johnson has given me my plan of studies, and free access to his\r\nlibrary. My ambition is not great, nor my views unbounded. I shall\r\nproportion the means to the object. If I persevere with attention, I\r\nhave something more than wishes to build upon. Nothing within the\r\ncompass of my abilities, that is justifiable, will be left untried, to\r\ngratify my reasonable desires.\r\n\r\nI know that your request proceeded entirely from your friendship for\r\nme, and that you felt happy that it was in your power to oblige me. I\r\nfeel the force of your kindness, but must deny myself the pleasure of\r\nspending some months with my friend. My time is short; age presses\r\nupon me. Four years have been devoted to my country, for which I have\r\nreceived no compensation.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to hear that your health is such that you can be\r\nthankful for the blessing, and are in a situation to enjoy yourself in\r\nthe pursuit of your studies. My heart is sincerely interested in your\r\nhappiness. Let me know your feelings, that I may know how to refine\r\nmine. Your friendship and letters add a continual charm to my life,\r\nand will always please the heart and secure the affection of, yours,\r\n\r\nWith sincerity,\r\n\r\nR. ALDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. PREVOST.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 5th June, 1781.\r\n\r\nI was absent when yours of the 10th ultimo came, and therefore did not\r\nreceive it till the first inst. You may be assured will one day repent\r\nhis insolence. Uniformity of conduct and great appearance of\r\nmoderation are all that can be put in practice immediately. The maxim\r\nof a man whom neither of us esteem very highly is excellent on this\r\noccasion--\"_Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re_.\" See, my dear\r\nTheodosia, what you bring upon yourself by having once piddled at\r\nLatin. The maxim, however, would bear sheets of comment and days of\r\nreflection. I second the just pride of ----, in being averse to crouch\r\nto a villain. Your letter to E. would have every influence that mine\r\npossibly could.\r\n\r\nThese crosses are of that class which, though they may perplex for a\r\nmoment (a moment is too much), yet cannot affect our real happiness.\r\nThat mind is truly great which can bear with equanimity the trifling\r\nand unavoidable vexations of life, and be affected only by those\r\nevents which determine our substantial bliss. Every period, and every\r\nsituation, has a portion of these trifling crosses; and those who\r\nexpect to avoid them all, or conquer them all, must be wretched\r\nwithout respite. Witness -----. I am half vexed at the manner in which\r\nyou speak of what you term \"the sorrows of -----.\" They are just of\r\nthis trifling kind. Say and think no more of them. Their impression\r\nwas momentary, and is long past.\r\n\r\nG.'s uniformity of conduct for some time has established his\r\ncharacter, and crushed the malice of his enemies. He has, however,\r\nmingled some address in his deportment--has made visits, and some acts\r\nof civility, to his avowed enemies, by which means he has gained some\r\nand silenced others. His whole conduct, his language, and even his\r\nthoughts, seem to have in view the happiness of. I believe this idea\r\nis impressed on him every hour of his life.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHIEF-JUSTICE MORRIS.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 21st October, 1781.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI do myself the honour to enclose you several letters, which were\r\nintended, I believe, to introduce me to your acquaintance, perhaps to\r\nyour friendship. I am particularly unfortunate to see neither Mr.\r\nHobart nor yourself on the present occasion; the more so, as I find a\r\nrule of unexpected rigour, which, if strictly adhered to, must\r\neffectually exclude me from this bar. Mr. Judge Yates gives me reason\r\nto hope this rule may be enlarged. If it should be deemed unadvisable\r\nto make one of such latitude as may include me within a general\r\ndescription, perhaps my particular situation may be thought to claim\r\nparticular indulgence. Before the revolution, and long before the\r\nexistence of the present rule, I had served some time with an attorney\r\nof another state. At that period I could have availed my self of this\r\nservice; and, surely, no rule could be intended to have such\r\nretrospect as to injure _one whose only misfortune is having\r\nsacrificed his time, his constitution, and his fortune, to his\r\ncountry_.\r\n\r\nIt would give me sensible regret were my admission to establish a\r\nprecedent which might give umbrage to the bar; but, should your\r\nopinion accord with my wishes, with respect to the indulgence due to\r\nmy particular case, the expression of it, to any gentleman of the\r\nprofession, would doubtless remove the possibility of discontent.\r\nPerhaps I assume a freedom which personal acquaintance only could\r\nwarrant. I beg, sir, you will ascribe it to the reliance I am taught\r\nto place on your goodness, and the confidence with which your\r\ncharacter inspires even those who have no other title to your notice.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the success of my present designs, I shall do myself\r\nthe honour of waiting on you, and assuring you, in person, of the\r\nrespect and esteem with which I am your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Burr frequently impressed upon those with whom he was in the\r\nhabit of a regular correspondence, the advantage of committing to\r\npaper daily, in the form of a journal, such thoughts or ideas as\r\noccurred and were deemed desirable to repeat. He adopted this form in\r\nhis communications with Mrs. Prevost. The following is a specimen:--\r\n\r\nAlbany, Thursday, December 3d, 1781.\r\n\r\nI am at length arrived at my destined haven, and, what is very unusual\r\nfor me, have been successful in several trivial circumstances, such as\r\ngetting over the ferry (which is difficult at this season), finding\r\ntemporary quarters for my chevaux without difficulty or delay. I\r\ncannot help regarding these as harbingers of good luck. I am, however,\r\nnot fortunate in finding Judge Yates. He is from home. G. civil, but\r\nunwell. The room promised me is not fitted; must therefore seek other\r\nlodgings. Bon soir. Visit me in my slumbers.\r\n\r\nFriday night, December 4th.\r\n\r\nTill sunset I was in doubt whether I should not be obliged to leave\r\nAlbany for want of quarters. Have at length found tolerable. No price\r\nyet fixed. Probably not less than trois piasters the week. A day\r\ncompletely lost, and I, of course, in ill humour with every thing but\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nSaturday, December 5th.\r\n\r\nA sick headache this whole day. I earned it by eating last night a\r\nhearty supper of Dutch sausages, and going to bed immediately after. I\r\nam surprised it did not operate in the way of my disorder, which was\r\nformerly the certain consequence of every error in diet; but no\r\nsymptom of that, though I was very restless.\r\n\r\nI took the true Indian cure for the headache. Made a light breakfast\r\nof tea, stretched myself on a blanket before the fire, fasted till\r\nevening, and then tea again. I thought, through the whole day, that if\r\nyou could sit by me, and stroke my head with your little hand, it\r\nwould be well; and that, when we are formally united, far from deeming\r\na return of this disorder un malheur, I should esteem it a fortunate\r\napology for a day of luxurious indulgence, which I should not\r\notherwise allow myself or you.\r\n\r\nMost unexpectedly, Lewis called upon me this evening, civilly offered\r\nme his house, and asked me to dine. I was wrong, I think, to accept\r\nhis invitation, but this did not strike me till I had engaged. Must\r\ndine there to-morrow.\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th December.\r\n\r\nThis is the third day in town, and no business done. These two days\r\npast I have been studying the second volume of Rousseau. G. is\r\nreturned. He never appeared more unlike himself. I was somehow\r\nuncommonly stupid, and, would you believe it, even awkward. Said very\r\nlittle, and that little with hesitation. You know there are days when\r\nevery thing goes against one. Paid little attention to anybody (that\r\nlittle, somehow, ill timed), and received still less from them.\r\n\r\nHow could we forget Latimer? He has sung Theodosia's praise among the\r\nsouthern army in terms with which her best friends must be pleased. He\r\nhas also established the character of A. Burr. Quackenbush is\r\ndetermined to be civil. Says his visits will be frequent.\r\n\r\nYates is returned. More of him to-morrow. An old, weather-beaten lady,\r\nMiss Depeyster, has given the whole history of Burr, and much of\r\nTheo., but nothing unfavourable. In a place where Burr thought himself\r\na stranger, there is scarce any age or sex that does not, either from\r\nin formation or acquaintance, know something of him.\r\n\r\nI am surprised I forgot to advise you to get a Franklin fireplace.\r\nThey have not the inconvenience of stoves, are warm, save wood, and\r\nnever smoke. The cost will not be, probably, more than ten or fifteen\r\ndollars, which will be twice saved this winter in wood and _comfort_,\r\nand they may be moved anywhere. If you have fears about _brat_,\r\n[Foonote: Mrs. Prevost's youngest child.] I have none. He will never\r\nburn himself but once; and, by way of preventive, I would advise you\r\nto do that for him. It will be put up in a few hours by anybody. I am\r\nin doubt whether it will be best to have it in the common room or one\r\nof the back rooms. The latter will have many advantages. You may then\r\nhave a place sacred to love, reflection, and books. This, however, as\r\nyou find best; but that you have one I am determined, unless you can\r\ngive some better reason against it than I at present know of. Indeed,\r\nI would wish you had two. You will get them with no trouble from the\r\nSalisbury furnace. It is of the first importance that you suffer as\r\nlittle as possible the present winter. It may, in a great measure,\r\ndetermine your health ever after. I confess I have still some\r\ntransient distrusts that you set too little value on your own life and\r\ncomfort. Remember, it is not yours alone; but your letters shall\r\nconvince me. I waive the subject.\r\n\r\nI am not certain I shall be regularly punctual in writing you in this\r\nmanner every day when I get at business; but I shall, if possible,\r\ndevote one quarter of an hour a day to you. In return, I demand one\r\nhalf of an hour every day from you; more I forbid, unless on special\r\noccasions. This half hour is to be mine, to be invariably at the same\r\ntime, and, for that purpose, fixed at an hour least liable to\r\ninterruption, and as you shall find most convenient. Mine cannot be so\r\nregular, as I only indulge myself in it when I am fatigued with\r\nbusiness. The children will have each their sheet, and, at the given\r\nhour, write, if but a single word Burr, at this half hour is to be a\r\nkind of watchword.\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th December.\r\n\r\nI keep always a memorandum for you, on which, when I think of any\r\nthing at any time of day that I wish to write, I make a short note in\r\na manner which no other person would understand. When I sit down to\r\nwrite I have nothing to do but look at my memorandum. I would\r\nrecommend the same to you, unless you rather choose to write at the\r\nmoment when you think of any thing.\r\n\r\nI have continually felt some apprehensions about the success of Troup\r\nwith the court. The Springs are but twenty-eight miles from Albany; I\r\nwill meet you there.\r\n\r\nPhil. Van Rensselaer, whom I have never before seen, has been to\r\nintroduce himself, and tender his services of every kind. He is of the\r\nmost respectable and richest inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th December.\r\n\r\nNo place yet; but, that time need not be lost, I have been looking\r\nover Rousseau's 4th volume. I imagine ----- gathered thence his\r\nsentiments on the subject of jealousy. If so, he has grossly mistaken\r\nthe ideas of Rousseau. Do you discover a symptom of it? Far otherwise.\r\nYou see only confidence and love. That jealousy for which you are an\r\nadvocate, he condemns as appertaining to brutes and sensualists.\r\nDiscard, I beseech you, ideas so degrading to true love. I am\r\nmortified with the reflection that they were ever yours.\r\n\r\nI think ----- must have taken pains to have overlooked the following\r\nparagraph, when, in enumerating the duties of a woman towards a lover\r\nor husband, he makes it principally to consist \"in respecting\r\nthemselves, in order to acquire respect. How delightful are these\r\nprivileges! How respectable are they! how cordially do men prize them,\r\nwhen a woman knows how to render them estimable.\" I fear ----- will be\r\nconvinced of this but too late. I am glad to find, however, that the\r\nidea so often urged (in vain) by me, is not a mere vagary of my own\r\nbrain, but is supported by so good authority.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 9th December.\r\n\r\nI have this day made a feint at law. But, were my life at stake, it\r\ncould not command my attention.\r\n\r\nThursday, 10th December.\r\n\r\nWe have about twelve or fourteen inches of snow. When you read my\r\nletters I wish you would make minutes at the time of such facts as\r\nrequire an answer; for, if you trust your memory till the time of\r\nwriting, you will omit half you would otherwise say.\r\n\r\nFriday, 11th December.\r\n\r\nI really wish much to know the conduct of -----. It is, however, more\r\ncuriosity than anxiety. It would be childish to build any part of\r\none's happiness on a basis so unstable.\r\n\r\nThe Van Rensselaer before mentioned, and henceforth to be designated\r\nby _Ll_., proves to be a phenomenon of goodness and (can you believe\r\nit) even tenderness. Tenderness, I hear you cry, in a Hollandois! But\r\nhold your injustice; the character and fine heart of Van Rensselaer\r\nwill, I think, in future, remove your prejudice, especially when you\r\nadd to this his marked attention and civility.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 12th December.\r\n\r\nVan Rensselaer finds fault with my quarters, which, indeed, are far\r\nremoved from elegance, and, in some respects, from convenience. He\r\ninsists that I suffer him to provide me better.\r\n\r\nI have not hitherto had an hour of Yates. His reasons, however, have\r\nbeen good. On Monday we are to mangle law.\r\n\r\nSunday, 13th December.\r\n\r\nVan Rensselaer has succeeded perfectly to my wish. I am with two\r\nmaidens, aunts of his, obliging and (incredible!!) good-natured. The\r\nvery paragon of neatness. Not an article of furniture, even to a\r\nteakettle, that would soil a muslin handkerchief. I have two upper\r\nrooms. I was interrupted at the line above, and cannot now, for my\r\nlife, recollect what I was intending to write. I leave it, however, to\r\nplague you as it has done me.\r\n\r\nMonday, 14th December.\r\n\r\nI really fear Yates is playing the fool with me. Still evasive, though\r\nplausibly so. I have just had an interview. To-morrow I must and will\r\ncome to a positive eclaircissement.\r\n\r\nI am determined, in future, when doubt arises in my mind whether I\r\nshall write a thing or not, invariably to write it. You recollect\r\n-----'s advising that Carlos [3] should learn the violin.\r\n\r\nG. was unkind enough to remind him that he was formerly opposed to\r\nthat opinion. There was a degree of insult in this reproach of which I\r\ndid not think G. capable. I truly believe he did not reflect on the\r\ntendency of it. I do not remember that he is apt to take such unfair\r\nadvantage of his friends. Happy they who can make improvement of each\r\nother's errors. The necessary, but dear-bought knowledge of\r\nexperience, is earned at double cost by those who reap alone.\r\n\r\nSince I left you, I have not taken pen in hand without intending to\r\nwrite you. I am happy in having done it, for I now feel perfectly\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 15th December.\r\n\r\nYesterday was partly a day of business. The evening wholly and\r\nadvantageously so. This day has been rather a feint. Yates engaged. I\r\nbeg ten thousand pardons of Miss Depeyster; she is our warm friend and\r\nadvocate. One Bogart, at Tappan, is the scoundrel.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 16th December.\r\n\r\nI perceive this letter-writing will not answer; though I write very\r\nlittle, it is still half my business; for, whenever I find myself\r\neither at a loss what to do, or any how discomposed or dull, I fly to\r\nthese sheets, and even if I do not write, I ponder upon it, and in\r\nthis way sacrifice many hours without reflecting that time passes\r\naway. Yates still backward, but the day tolerably spent.\r\n\r\nI have also been busy in fixing a Franklin fireplace for myself. I\r\nshall have it completed to-morrow. I am resolved you shall have one or\r\ntwo of them. You have no idea of their convenience, and you can at any\r\ntime remove them.\r\n\r\nI expect to despatch Carlos to-morrow. I think I have already\r\nmentioned that I wrote you from Kinderhook, and also this week by\r\nColonel Lewis, enclosed to our friend at Sharon.\r\n\r\nAn engagement of business to-day and this evening with Yates, prevents\r\nme preparing for Carlos as I expected.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. The lady of the Hon. Stephen Van Rensselaer\r\n\r\n2. The sons of Mrs. Prevost, Frederick and John B. The latter was\r\nJudge Prevost, of Louisiana. Mrs. Prevost was unable to expend such a\r\nsum on these young gentlemen. it was a means adopted by Colonel Burr\r\ndelicately to assist, from his own purse, a desponding son of science.\r\nSimilar instances of his liberality, in the course of his life, were\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\n3. A negro boy belonging to Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1781, as may be seen by the preceding correspondence,\r\nColonel Burr was in Albany, preparing himself for admission to the\r\nbar. Judge Yates rendered him essential service on the occasion. His\r\nfriendship and kindness were appreciated, and gratefully recollected.\r\nAt that time Chief-justice Richard Morris, Robert Yates, and John\r\nSloss Hobart composed the bench of the Supreme Court of the State of\r\nNew-York. All these gentlemen were friendly to Burr, and treated him\r\nwith the utmost courtesy; but for Judge Yates he entertained, during\r\nthe continuance of his life, the most profound respect and veneration.\r\n\r\nBy the rules of the court it was required that candidates for\r\nadmission should have pursued a course of legal studies not less than\r\nthree years previous to presenting themselves for examination. Colonel\r\nBurr applied to the court to dispense with this rule in his case. The\r\napplication was opposed with great zeal by all the members of the bar;\r\nand, as no counsellor would make the necessary motion on the subject,\r\nBurr was not only compelled to do it himself, but to argue the\r\nquestion with the ablest of the profession.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the argument, the court determined that, as he had been\r\nemployed in the service of his country, when he might, under other\r\ncircumstances, have been a law-student, they would dispense with the\r\nrigour of the rule so far as it applied to the period of study; but\r\nthat no indulgence would be granted in reference to the necessary\r\nqualifications. In pursuance of this decision he underwent a severe\r\nand critical examination by some of the most eminent members of the\r\nbar, who were anxious for his rejection. The examination, however,\r\nresulted in a triumphant admission that the candidate was duly\r\nqualified to practise; and he was accordingly licensed as an attorney,\r\non the 19th day of January, 1782. And at \"a supreme court of\r\njudicature, held for the State of New-York, at the City Hall of the\r\ncity of Albany, on the 17th day of April, 1782, Aaron Burr having, on\r\nexamination, been found of competent ability and learning to practise\r\nas counsellor,\" it was ordered that he be accordingly admitted.\r\n\r\nSoon after Colonel Burr commenced the practice of law in the city of\r\nAlbany, he invited his friend and brother soldier, Major W. Popham, to\r\njoin him, and pursue a course of legal studies. This invitation was\r\ngiven with his accustomed kindness. About the period of Burr's\r\nmarriage, Major Popham replies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MAJOR W. POPHAM [1]\r\n\r\nFishkill, August 16th, 1782\r\n\r\nYesterday I was accidentally favoured with your friendly letter of the\r\n3d of May, from Litchfield, which was peculiarly agreeable, as it\r\ncontained the first official accounts I have had of you since my\r\nleaving Albany, and dispelled a train of gloomy reflections which your\r\nsupposed long silence had suggested.\r\n\r\nThe approbation you have given of my conduct, in an affair in which\r\nyou have so generously interested yourself, is very flattering. A\r\ndetail of the circumstances which rendered it necessary to postpone\r\nthe prosecution of my intended plan, would be too prolix for the\r\nsubject of a letter. They would not present one pleasing reflection;\r\nand I love you too well to give you pain. Suspend, therefore, your\r\ncuriosity and your opinion, until the duties of the field permit me to\r\nsee you, when you shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\nI hope the alterations you have made in your plan of life may equal\r\nyour most sanguine wishes. I am pleased that you have taken a house in\r\nAlbany, and sincerely congratulate you on an event that promises you\r\nso much happiness. May you long enjoy all the blessings which can flow\r\nfrom that happy state, for which Heaven has so remarkably designed\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nBut why am I requested to \"_say nothing about obligations_,\" while you\r\ncontinue to load me with new ones? Or, why should I be denied the\r\ncommon privilege of every liberal mind, that of acknowledging the\r\nobligation which I have not the power of cancelling? Yes, my friend,\r\nyour generous offer claims my warmest thanks; but the very principle\r\nwhich excites my gratitude forbids me to accept it. Dr. L informs me\r\nyou have written twice to me. One of the letters is lost. Will you\r\nspeedily supply the deficiency? If you can spare an hour from\r\nbusiness, retirement, or love, let me entreat you to devote it to your\r\nfriend. I cannot tell you how much I long to hear from you. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW. POPHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Prevost.\r\n\r\nAlbany, December 23d, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy dear Theodosia is now happy by the arrival of Carlos. This was not\r\nwishing you a happy Christmas, but actually making it so. Let all our\r\ncompliments be henceforth practical. The language of the world sounds\r\nfulsome to tastes refined by the sweets of affection.\r\n\r\nI see mingle in the transports of the evening the frantic little\r\nBartow. [2] Too eager to embrace the bliss he has in prospect;\r\nfrustrating his own purposes by inconsiderate haste; misplacing every\r\nthing, and undoing what he meant to do. It will only confuse you.\r\nNothing better can be done than to tie him, in order to expedite his\r\nown business. That you might not be cheerful alone, I have obeyed the\r\norders of your heart (for you cannot, even at this distance, conceal\r\nthem) by a determination to take a social, friendly supper with Van\r\nRensselaer.\r\n\r\nYou wrote me too much by Dom. I hope it was not from a fear that I\r\nshould be dissatisfied with less. It is, I confess, rather singular to\r\nfind fault with the quantity, when matter and manner are so\r\ndelightful. You must, however, deal less in sentiments and more in\r\nideas. Indeed, in the letter in answer to my last, you will need to be\r\nparticularly attentive to this injunction. I think constantly of the\r\napproaching change in our affairs, and what it demands. Do not let us,\r\nlike children, be so taken with the prospect as to lose sight of the\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nRemember to write me facts and ideas, and don't torment me with\r\ncompliments, or yourself with sentiments to which I am already no\r\nstranger. Write but little, and very little at once. I do not know for\r\nwhat reason, Theodosia, but I cannot feel my usual anxiety about your\r\nhealth, though I know you to be ill, and dangerously so. One reason\r\nis, that I have more belief in your attention to yourself.\r\n\r\nYour idea about the water was most delightful. It kept me awake a\r\nwhole night, and led to a train of thoughts and sensations which\r\ncannot be described. Indeed, the whole of your letter was marked with\r\na degree of confidence and reliance which augurs every thing that is\r\ngood. The French letter was truly elegant, as also that enclosed in\r\ncompliance with my request.\r\n\r\nIf Reeves has received the money upon the order I gave him, he may\r\nsend me by Carlos about twenty-five guineas, if he can spare so much\r\nof it. I am in no present want.\r\n\r\nPardon me for not answering your last. My mind is so engrossed by new\r\nviews and expectations, that I cannot disengage it. I have not, these\r\nfive days past, slept more than _two hours_ a night, and yet feel\r\nrefreshed and well. Your presentiments of my illness on a certain\r\nevening were wide from truth: believe me, you have no talent that way.\r\nLeave it to others.\r\n\r\nI think, if you keep Carlos two nights, it will serve; but keep him\r\nlonger rather than fatigue yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of July, 1782, Colonel Burr was married to Mrs. Theodosia\r\nPrevost. In April preceding he had entered into the practice of the\r\nlaw in the city of Albany. His attention to business was unremitted.\r\nIn consequence, he soon found himself crowded with clients from every\r\nquarter of the state. During his residence in Albany, his mind was\r\nexclusively engrossed with his profession and his family. In the\r\neducation of Mrs. Burr's children by her first husband he took a deep\r\ninterest. Neither labour nor expense was regarded. It was his wish\r\nthat they should be accomplished, as well as educated men.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary treaty of peace having been signed, Colonel Burr\r\nresolved to remove his family to the city of New-York so soon as the\r\nBritish should evacuate it. Here he anticipated (and in this he was\r\nnot disappointed) an extensive practice. On the 20th of November,\r\n1781, the legislature of the State of New-York passed an act\r\ndisqualifying from practice, in the courts of the state, all\r\n\"attorneys, solicitors, and counsellors at law,\" who could not produce\r\nsatisfactory certificates, showing their attachment and devotion to\r\nthe whig cause during the then pending war with Great Britain. This\r\nact was in full force at the peace of 1783, and remained so, without\r\nany attempt to modify it, until March, 1785, when a bill was\r\nintroduced into the legislature to repeal certain sections of it, so\r\nfar as they operated upon individuals therein named. The bill was\r\nlost. But, on the 4th of April, 1786, the restriction thus imposed on\r\nthe tory lawyers was removed by an act of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1781, previous to its repeal, had operated most favourably\r\nfor the Whig lawyers. Those of talents and standing, such as Colonel\r\nBurr and others, had obtained a run of business which enabled them to\r\ncompete with the most profound of their tory rivals.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that the British troops would evacuate the city of\r\nNew-York in the spring or early in the summer of 1783; but they\r\nremained until the 25th of November of that year. Colonel Burr applied\r\nto his friend, Thomas Bartow, to procure him a house for the\r\naccommodation of his family, which he accordingly did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MR. BARTOW.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 16th, 1783\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI received your agreeable favour a few days ago, and am happy to\r\ncongratulate you on the establishment of a peace: hope I shall soon\r\nhave the pleasure of seeing you in town. I have procured you a good\r\nhouse in Maiden-lane, at the rate of two hundred pounds a year. The\r\nrent to commence when the troops leave the city. Doctor Brown can\r\ninform you more particulars about it, as he went with me to view it.\r\nBefore I engaged this house, I consulted Mrs. Clark She proposed her\r\nhouse in Broadway, but could not get the tenant out, so that she gave\r\nher consent to this.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BARTOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 25th March, 1783.\r\n\r\nSome think absence tends to increase affection; the greater part that\r\nit wears it away. I believe neither, but that it only tends to prove\r\nhow far the heart is capable of loving; or rather, whether it is real\r\nor imaginary. When the latter, every object that amuses, blots out the\r\nidea of the absent, we find that they are not so necessary to our\r\nhappiness as we had fancied. But when that love is real, what can\r\namuse, what engage the mind, to banish, for a single instant, the\r\nobject of its delight? It hates every necessity that wrests it an\r\ninstant from the contemplation of its beauties; its virtues are ever\r\npresenting themselves to increase our regret, and suggest innumerable\r\nfears for its safety. Such have been the occupations of this day. I\r\ntremble at every noise: new apprehensions are ever alarming me. Every\r\ntender sensation is awake to thee.\r\n\r\n26th March.\r\n\r\nMy extreme anxiety operated severely upon my health. I have not had so\r\nill a turn in some months. The remedies of S. prove but little more\r\nefficacious than those of G. I do without either. Various are the\r\nconjectures respecting your errand. All think me of the party. My\r\nspirits need, my heart grows impatient for your return. Every\r\ncountenance speaks for you, while Theodosia grieves.\r\n\r\n27th March.\r\n\r\nMy health is rather better. I have just this moment heard of General\r\nSchuyler's going; have only time to tell you I rejoice at the\r\nenclosed. It will save your hurry and anxiety Popham has written and\r\nengaged for your attendance.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British were about to evacuate the city of New-York, and it\r\nwas ascertained that Colonel Burr had made the necessary arrangements\r\nto settle there, his whig friends became anxious that he should\r\nreceive an appointment. Among those who urged this measure was Judge\r\nHobart, who had ever entertained an exalted opinion of his talents and\r\nbusiness habits. As soon as Colonel Burr was informed of the friendly\r\nviews entertained by the judge, he wrote him, expressing his\r\nunwillingness to be considered a competitor with any gentleman for an\r\nappointment. To this he received an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JUDGE HOBART.\r\n\r\nJune 17th, 1783.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour favour has been received. However pure your views may be, I fear\r\nyou must be contented with the character of a private gentleman so\r\nlong as you determine to avoid a competition; for I am told there are\r\nlong lists of applicants for all the offices in the city and county of\r\nNew-York.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, yours,\r\n\r\nJOHN SLOSS HOBART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, August 14th, 1783.\r\n\r\nHow unfortunate, my dearest Aaron, is our present separation. I never\r\nshall have resolution to consent to another. We must not be guided by\r\nothers. We are certainly formed of different materials; and our\r\nundertakings must coincide with them.\r\n\r\nA few hours after I wrote you by Colonel Lewis, our sweet infant [3]\r\nwas taken ill, very ill. My mind and spirits have been on the rack\r\nfrom that moment to this. When she sleeps, I watch anxiously; when she\r\nwakes, anxious fears accompany every motion. I talked of my love\r\ntowards her, but I knew it not till put to this unhappy test. I know\r\nnot whether to give her medicine or withhold it: doubt and terror are\r\nthe only sensations of which I am sensible. She has slept better last\r\nnight, and appears more lively this morning, than since her illness.\r\nThis has induced me to postpone an express to you, which I have had in\r\nreadiness since yesterday. If this meets you, I need not dwell upon my\r\nwish. I will only put an injunction on your riding so fast, or in the\r\nheat, or dew. Remember your presence is to support, to console your\r\nTheo., perhaps to rejoice with her at the restoration of our\r\nmuch-loved child. Let us encourage this hope; encourage it, at least,\r\ntill you see me, which I flatter myself will be before this can reach\r\nyou. Some kind spirit will whisper to my Aaron how much his tender\r\nattention is wanted to support his Theo.: how much his love is\r\nnecessary to give her that fortitude, that resolution, which nature\r\nhas denied her but through his medium. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, March 22d, 1784.\r\n\r\nMy Aaron had scarce quitted the door when I regretted my passiveness.\r\nWhy did I consent to his departure? Can interest repay the sacrifice?\r\ncan aught on earth compensate for his presence? Why did I hesitate to\r\ndecide? Ten thousand fears await me. What thought suggested my assent?\r\nThe anxiety he might suffer were he to meet with obstacles to raising\r\nthe sum required; should his views be frustrated for want of the\r\nprecaution this journey might secure; his mortification; mine, at not\r\nhaving the power to relieve him, were arguments that silenced my\r\nlonging wish to hold him near me; near me for ever. My Aaron, dark is\r\nthe hour that separates my soul from itself.\r\n\r\nThus pensive, surrounded with gloom, thy Theo. sat, bewailing thy\r\ndeparture. Every breath of wind whistled terror; every noise at the\r\ndoor was mingled with hope of thy return, and fear of thy\r\nperseverance, when Brown arrived with the word--_embarked_--the wind\r\nhigh, the water rough. Heaven protect my Aaron; preserve him, restore\r\nhim to his adoring mistress. A tedious hour elapsed, when our son was\r\nthe joyful messenger of thy safe landing at Paulus Hook.\r\n\r\nStiff with cold, how must his papa have fared? Yet, grateful for his\r\nsafety, I blessed my God. I envied the ground which bore my pilgrim. I\r\npursued each footstep. Love engrossed his mind; his last adieu to\r\nBartow was the most persuasive token--\"Wait till I reach the opposite\r\nshore, that you may bear the glad tidings to your trembling mother.\"\r\nO, Aaron, how I thank thee! Love in all its delirium hovers about me;\r\nlike opium, it lulls me to soft repose! Sweet serenity speaks, 'tis my\r\nAaron's spirit presides. Surrounding objects check my visionary charm.\r\nI fly to my room and give the day to thee.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, October 29th, 1784.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts this instant acquaints me that he is just setting off for\r\nNew-York. I run from court to waft you a memorandum of affection. I\r\nhave been remarkably well; was fortunate in my journey. The trial of\r\nLivingston and Hoffman is now arguing. It began on Thursday of last\r\nweek, and will not conclude till to-night. No other business has been\r\nor will be done this term. All this cursed long absence for nothing.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this till Sunday or Monday. Then to Westchester Court.\r\nThe return to joy and Theo. cannot be till Thursday or Friday, and\r\nthat depending on my business in Westchester. Miss Yates is on her\r\npassage to New-York to spend eight or ten days.\r\n\r\nI read your memorandum ten times a day, and observed it as religiously\r\nas ever monk did his devotion. Yesterday I burnt it. To me it seemed\r\nlike sacrilege.\r\n\r\nI fear I did not caution you enough against sleeping in the new house.\r\nFor Heaven's sake (or rather for my sake), don't think of it till I\r\ncome and judge. I left you an immensity of trouble, which I fear has\r\nnot promoted your health. Kiss our dear little flock for me. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn of 1783 Colonel Burr removed from Albany into the\r\ncity of New-York. In the spring of 1784 he was elected a member of the\r\nstate legislature. At that early period political parties had not\r\nassumed either form or shape. The simple and intelligible terms of\r\nwhip and tory were universally used. Colonel Burr's mind was occupied\r\nwith his professional business. The legislature met in the city of\r\nNew-York. He attended two sessions as a member. The first commenced on\r\nthe 12th of October, 1784. He was in the house only a small portion of\r\nthe time, and never interfered in what might be considered the\r\nordinary business of the day. On great questions he took an active and\r\ndecided part. His character for sagacity, discrimination, and\r\nfirmness, was well established; and he would, therefore, have\r\npossessed great influence, if such had been his object; but his\r\nambition, at this time, was not political; or, if it was, he had\r\ndetermined to smother it \"until a more convenient season.\"\r\n\r\nThe second session while he was a member commenced on the 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1785. During this he was more attentive than at the preceding\r\nsession, but governed by the same system of policy, acting only when\r\ngreat and important questions were under consideration. On the 14th of\r\nFebruary a joint committee of the two houses was appointed to revise\r\nthe laws of the state. Colonel Burr was chairman of the committee on\r\nthe part of the house. He introduced, on leave granted him, several\r\nimportant bills. One in relation to the public lands, another relative\r\nto the titles to real estate, &c. On the 25th of February a bill was\r\npending for the gradual abolition of slavery within the State of\r\nNew-York. It provided that all born after its passage should be born\r\nfree. Burr moved to amend, and proposed to insert a provision, that\r\nslavery should be entirely abolished after a day specified. His\r\namendment being lost, he voted for the bill as reported. He was a\r\nmember of the legislature, and supported the law in 1799, by which,\r\nultimately, slavery within the state was abolished.\r\n\r\nThe question upon which he took the most prominent part related to an\r\napplication of some tradesmen and mechanics in the city of New-York\r\nfor an act of incorporation. The advocates of this bill had united\r\ntheir interest with certain land speculators, and by these means it\r\nwas supposed both bills might be carried through the legislature.\r\nBoth, however, failed. Colonel Burr was the only member from the city\r\nof New-York that opposed what was termed the Mechanics' Bill. His\r\nopposition produced so much feeling and excitement, that a man of less\r\nfirmness would have been driven from his course. Riots were\r\nthreatened, and by many it was supposed his house would be assaulted.\r\nHis friends volunteered their services to protect him, but he declined\r\nreceiving their aid, averring that he had no fears of any violation of\r\nthe laws by men who had made such sacrifices as the whigs had made for\r\nthe right of self-government, and that he could and would protect\r\nhimself, if, contrary to his expectations, it should become necessary.\r\nThat he was prepared to resist any attack was universally known, but\r\nnone was attempted, and perhaps for that reason.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanics' Bill passed the legislature late in February, and was\r\nsent to the Council of Revision. At that time the chancellor and the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court formed a Council of Revision, and had a\r\nqualified negative on all bills. If they considered a bill\r\nunconstitutional, they returned it to the house in which it\r\noriginated, with their objections; after which, if it received the\r\nvote of two thirds of both houses, it became a law. This bill was\r\nreturned on the 9th of March by the council, with their objections,\r\nand, two thirds not voting in favour, it was lost. These objections,\r\nin substance, were precisely what had been urged against it by Colonel\r\nBurr on the floor of the assembly. The petitioners were forty-three in\r\nnumber. The bill gave them unlimited powers in some particulars. It\r\ndid not incorporate their successors, only so far as they pleased to\r\nadmit them. They might hold landed estate in perpetuity to an\r\nunlimited amount, provided their _income_ did exceed fifteen hundred\r\npounds beyond their _outgoings_. Their by-laws were to be approved by\r\nthe city corporation; thus, by rendering the one dependant on the\r\nother, either the mechanics would influence the magistrates, and the\r\npowers of the corporation of the city and county of New-York be made,\r\nat some future day, instruments of monopoly and oppression; or, which\r\nwas more probable, the corporation of the city and county of New-York\r\nobtain a controlling power over the mechanics, and thus add to the\r\nextensive influence which that corporation already enjoyed, thereby\r\nrendering it dangerous to the political freedom of the people. Such\r\nwere some of the objections entertained and urged by Colonel Burr\r\nagainst this bill. The great body of the community were prepared to\r\nsustain him; and, before the succeeding session of the legislature,\r\nthe intelligent among the mechanics were so well satisfied with the\r\ncorrectness of his views, that a similar application was never\r\nafterward made,\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1785 until the year 1788, Colonel Burr was unknown as a\r\npolitician. His practice was extensive and lucrative. His domestic\r\nrelations seemed to occupy all his leisure time. His family was large,\r\nand to direct the education of his children was to him the most\r\ndelightful employment. His zeal for their improvement is evinced in\r\nsome of the preceding letters. His own health was precarious, while\r\nthat of Mrs. Burr caused him constant alarm and apprehension. He had\r\nbut one child, a daughter; but the children of his wife by her first\r\nhusband (Colonel Prevost) he reared as his own, and with all the\r\ntenderness of an affectionate father. The subjoined letters present\r\nMrs. Burr in a most estimable point of view, while they cast some\r\nlight upon Colonel Burr's character as a parent and a husband. They\r\ncannot be read, it is believed, by even the giddy and the thoughtless\r\nwithout feeling an interest in the destiny of their writers.\r\n\r\nIn the office of Colonel Burr, as students, were his two stepsons,\r\nFrederick and John Bartow. When absent from home on professional or\r\nother business, one of them frequently accompanied him as an\r\namanuensis. On these occasions all his instructions in relation to\r\nlawsuits in which he was employed as counsel, or papers connected\r\ntherewith, were communicated to the attorney or clerk in the office\r\nthrough Mrs. Burr. She appeared to be held responsible for the\r\npunctual and prompt performance of any duty required of them. To him\r\nshe was indeed a helpmate; for she not only had charge of his domestic\r\nconcerns, but was counselled with, and intimately associated in, all\r\nhis business transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPrinceton, April, 1785.\r\n\r\nI had just embarked in the stage at Paulus Hook when I learned that it\r\nwent no further than Newark; so that, after being three hours close\r\npacked with rabble, I trudged an hour more to find a conveyance to\r\nElizabethtown, where I arrived at eight o'clock, chilled, fatigued,\r\nand with a surly headache. A comfortable bed and tea made amends.\r\n\r\nWe arrived here at six o'clock this evening. I am fortunate in\r\ncompany, and find the travelling much less fatiguing than I imagined.\r\nRemind Frederick of the business with Platt. Write me by the nest\r\npost, and by every stage. If I should even have left Philadelphia, I\r\nshall meet the letters. Speak of Harriet, and sur tout des trois\r\nTheo's. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April, Saturday, 1785.\r\n\r\nI did not write you on Friday, as promised in my letter from\r\nPrinceton, for which I will apologize when we meet. I arrived here in\r\ngood plight on Friday evening. Augustine came down about noon on\r\nSaturday. We have made some satisfactory progress in our business.\r\nSeeing the great men of other countries puts me in more conceit of\r\nthose of my own.\r\n\r\nI shall be released on Tuesday evening, which will permit me to see\r\nthee on Thursday morning. Mr. Colt will inform you about every thing.\r\nUnfortunately, a gentleman with whom part of our business is has left\r\ntown. If he should return to-morrow morning, I shall be the happiest\r\nof swains on Wednesday morning. I am very minute in these\r\ncalculations, because I make them very often. Does Theodosia employ\r\nherself ever in the same way?\r\n\r\nI have been to twenty places to find something to please you, but can\r\nsee nothing that answers my wishes; you will therefore, I fear, only\r\nreceive\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April, Saturday, 1785.\r\n\r\nI persuade myself this is the last day you spend in Philadelphia. That\r\nto-morrow's stage will bring you to Elizabethtown; that Tuesday\r\nmorning you will breakfast with those who pass the tedious hours\r\nregretting your absence, and counting time till you return. Even\r\nlittle Theo. gives up her place on mamma's lap to tell dear\r\npapa--\"come home.\" Tell Augustine he does not know how much he owes\r\nme. 'Tis a sacrifice I would not make to any human being but himself,\r\nnor even to him again. It is the last time of my life I submit to your\r\nabsence, except from necessity to the calls of your profession. All is\r\nwell at home. Ireson gone on his intended journey. Morris very little\r\nhere. The boys very attentive and industrious; much more so for being\r\nalone. Not a loud word spoken by the servants. All, in silent\r\nexpectation, await the return of their much-loved lord; but _all\r\nfaintly_ when compared to thy\r\n\r\nTHEO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nSince writing to you last evening, every thing has conspired to harass\r\nand delay me. I was really in hopes of surprising you on Wednesday\r\nmorning; but am now most unfortunately and cruelly detained here till\r\nto-morrow evening; shall therefore, with the usual luck of stages,\r\nembrace you on Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nI have been walking, in the course of this day, hunting offices,\r\nrecords, &c., &c., above eight hours, and am not fatigued. I must\r\nreally be very robust. Thine,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, April, 1785.\r\n\r\nI arrived here on Tuesday evening very late, though little fatigued.\r\nWednesday afternoon I went with Sill to Bethlehem (Nichols), drank\r\ntea, supped, and breakfasted. I am pleased with our friend's choice,\r\nof which more next Tuesday evening. I am vexed you were not of my\r\nparty here--that we did not charter a sloop. I have planned a\r\n_circuit_ with you to Long Island, with a number of pleasant &c.s,\r\nwhich are also reserved to a happier moment.\r\n\r\nI shall succeed in all Mrs. Clarke's business except that of the\r\nlands, in which I hope little.\r\n\r\nI feel impatient, and almost angry, that I have received no letter\r\nfrom you, though I really do not know of any opportunity by which you\r\ncould have written; but it seems an endless while to wait till\r\nSaturday night before I can hear from you. How convenient would a\r\nlittle of the phlegm of _this region_ be upon such occasions as these!\r\nI fear very much for our dear petite. I tell every one who asks me\r\nthat both she and you are well, because I abhor the cold, uninterested\r\ninquiries, which I know would be made if I should answer otherwise. Do\r\nyou want the pity of such? Those you thought your very good friends\r\nhere have forgotten you.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Y. is very civil. Are the Wadsworths with you? Have you\r\nnot been tormented with some embarrassments which I wickedly left you\r\nto struggle with? I hope you don't believe the epithet. But why these\r\nquestions, to which I can receive no answer but in person? I\r\nnevertheless fondly persuade myself that I shall receive answers to\r\nthem all, and many more about yourself, which I have in mind,\r\nnotwithstanding you will not have seen this. There is such a sympathy\r\nin our ideas and feelings, that you can't but know what will most\r\ninterest me.\r\n\r\nGive Johnstone the enclosed memorandum; or, if he has gone home, to\r\nBartow; the business is of importance, and admits of no delay.\r\n\r\nAffectionately adieu,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nChester, Friday, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nI arrived here about eleven o'clock this forenoon, with little\r\nfatigue, my horse being an excellent one. Appearances are hostile;\r\nthey talk of twenty or twenty-five days at least. I believe I shall\r\nnot hold out so long. The commissioners are met, but not all the\r\nparties, so that the business is not yet begun. The gentlemen from\r\nAlbany are not yet arrived or heard of. We shall probably do nothing\r\ntill they come. I have comfortable clean quarters.\r\n\r\nTell one of the boys to send me some supreme court seals; about six. I\r\nforgot them. Write me what calls are made at the office for me.\r\nDistribute my love. Let each of the children write me what they do.\r\nYou may certainly find some opportunity. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nChester, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nI strayed this morning for an hour or two in the woods, where I lay on\r\na rock to enjoy the wild retreat. The cheerfullness of all around me\r\nled me to ask why all animated nature enjoyed its being but man? Why\r\nman alone is discontented, anxious--sacrificing the present to idle\r\nexpectations;--expectations which, if answered, are in like manner\r\nsacrificed. Never enjoying, always hoping? Answer, _tu mihi magna\r\nApollo_. I would moralize, but time--and my companions are coming in.\r\nLet me hear of your health. Avoid all fatigue. Judge Yates proposes to\r\ncome down with me. Quoi faire?\r\n\r\nMy good landlady is out of tea, and begs me to send for a pound. Put\r\nit up very well. I am in better health than spirits. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nI am vexed that I did not inquire your route more particularly. I\r\ncannot trace you in imagination, nor find your spirit when at rest;\r\nnor dare I count the hours to your return. They are still too\r\nnumerous, and add to my impatience. I expect my reward in the health\r\nyou acquire. If it should prove otherwise, how I shall hate my\r\nacquiescence to your departure. I anticipate good or evil as my\r\nspirits rise or fall; but I know no medium; my mind cannot reach that\r\nstage of indifference. I fancy all my actions directed by you; this\r\ntends to spur my industry, and give calm to my leisure.\r\n\r\nThe family as you left it. Bartow never quits the office, and is\r\nperfectly obliging. Your dear little daughter seeks you twenty times a\r\nday; calls you to your meals, and will not suffer your chair to be\r\nfilled by any of the family.\r\n\r\nJudge Hobart called here yesterday; says you are absent for a month. I\r\ndo not admit that among possibilities, and therefore am not alarmed. I\r\nfeel obliged to Mr. Wickham for his delay, though I dare not give\r\nscope to my pen; my heart dictates too freely. O, my Aaron! how many\r\ntender, grateful things rush to my mind in this moment; how much\r\nfortitude do I summon to suppress them! You will do justice to their\r\nsilence; to the inexpressible affection of your _plus tendre amie_.\r\n\r\nBartow has been to the surveyor-general; he cannot inform him the\r\nboundaries of those lots for J. W. There is no map of them but one in\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nChester, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nI joined the commissioners and parties in the woods, near this place,\r\non Wednesday noon; found the weather severe, and roads bad. Have,\r\nsince my arrival, been following the commissioners in their surveys.\r\nNothing transpires from which we can conjecture their intentions.\r\n\r\nThis morning came your kind, your affectionate, your truly welcome\r\nletter of Monday evening. Where did it loiter so long? Nothing in my\r\nabsence is so flattering to me as your health and cheerfullness. I\r\nthen contemplate nothing so eagerly as my return; amuse myself with\r\nideas of my own happiness, and dwell on the sweet domestic joys which\r\nI fancy prepared for me.\r\n\r\nNothing is so unfriendly to every species of enjoyment as melancholy.\r\nGloom, however dressed, however caused, is incompatible with\r\nfriendship. They cannot have place in the mind at the same time. It is\r\nthe secret, the malignant foe of sentiment and love. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nYour dear letter was handed me this day, at a moment which, if\r\npossible, increased its value. I have a little fever hanging about me,\r\nwhich tends to depress my spirits for the time. Your moralizing\r\nchanged my dulness to a pleasing melancholy. I am mortified at the\r\ninterruption it met, and impatient to renew the theme; to renew it in\r\na more pleasing manner than even your letters afford. When my health\r\nis ill, I find your absence insupportable; every evil haunts me. It is\r\nthe last that must take place till term; _that_ I must submit to. I am\r\npleased with your account of your health and spirits; they are both as\r\nI wish.\r\n\r\nWhen you write again, speak of your return. The uncertainty makes it\r\nmore irksome. The company you speak of will be as welcome as any at\r\nthis juncture; but my health and mind seem to require the calm\r\nrecreation of friendly sympathy; the heart that has long been united\r\nto mine by the tenderest esteem and confidence, who has made every\r\nlittle anxiety its own, to whom I can speak without reserve every\r\nimaginary wo, and whose kind consolation shall appease those miseries\r\nnature has imposed. But whatever present inconveniences may arise, I\r\nsubmit to them with perfect resignation, rather than, even in idea, to\r\nexpect the one mentioned by you when last at home. My mind is\r\nimpressed with a perfect dread of all of that kind. We never can have\r\none to give us so little trouble as E. W., and yet we found it great.\r\nWe must avoid all such invitations, for the sacrifice on my part is\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\nFriday morning.\r\n\r\nI have passed a most tedious night. I went to bed much indisposed. M.\r\nabsent; mamma also. Ten thousand anxieties surrounded me till three,\r\nwhen I fell asleep; waked at six, much refreshed, and in better health\r\nthan I could possibly have expected. I flatter myself your task will\r\nend sooner than you expected. Mr. Marvin calls for my letter this\r\nmorning, which will be delivered with a pound of green tea I have\r\npurchased for your landlady at two dollars. He has called. I am\r\nhurried. Ten thousand loves\r\n\r\n_Toujours la vôtre_.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nJane's in the Mountains, May, 1785.\r\n\r\nI wrote my dear Theodosia a long letter of business and nonsense last\r\nevening from Chester. I am now about twelve miles nearer to you, and\r\nshall sleep to-night within thirty-five miles (only six hours' ride),\r\nand shall to-morrow return surlily to Chester.\r\n\r\nOur cavalcade is most fortunately composed. Some who abhor fatigue,\r\nothers who admire good fare, by which by which combination we ride\r\nslow and live well. We have halted here half an hour to lounge and\r\ntake a luncheon. Of the last, I partook reasonably. The time which\r\nothers devote to the former, I devote (of right) to you, and thus\r\nlounge with peculiar glee.\r\n\r\nBy return of Mr. Smith (who is obliging enough to deliver this), I\r\nexpect much longer letters from our lazy flock. By the next\r\nopportunity I determine not to write you, but some others who deserve\r\nmore attention than I fear they will think I mean to give them.\r\n\r\nThe girls must give me a history of their time, from rising to night.\r\nThe boys any thing which interests them, and which, of course, will\r\ninterest me. Are there any, or very pressing calls at the office? The\r\nword is given to mount. I shall have time to seal this and overtake\r\nthem. Kiss for me those who love me.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April, 1785.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wickham just called to tell me of an opportunity to Chester. How\r\njoyfully I embrace it. I had a most insupportable impatience to\r\ncommunicate to you my gratitude and thanks for your last visit. It was\r\na cordial to my health and spirits; a balm to my soul. My mind is\r\nflushed with pleasing hopes. Ten thousand tender thoughts rush to my\r\npen; but the bearer may prove faithless. I will suppress them to a\r\nhappier moment, and anticipate the dear indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe family as you left it. Thy Theodosia's health and spirits increase\r\ndaily. Bartow's industry and utility are striking to the family and\r\nstrangers. Johnstone returned yesterday. Your letter was as eagerly\r\nread as though I had not seen you. Write when you have leisure; if it\r\ndoes not reach me immediately, it will serve to divert some tedious\r\nmoment in a future absence; even when you are at home, engrossed by\r\nbusiness, I frequently find a singular pleasure in perusing those\r\ntestimonies of affection.\r\n\r\nI find I am continually speaking of myself. I can only account for it\r\nfrom my Aaron having persuaded me 'tis his favourite subject, and the\r\nextreme desire I have to please him induces me to pursue it. I take no\r\nwalks but up one stairs and down the other. The situation of my house\r\nwill not admit of my seeing many visitors. I hope some arrangement\r\nwill be accomplished by the next week.\r\n\r\nA packet from Sill. He writes like a happy man--not the happy man of a\r\nday, or I am much deceived in him. She is certainly to be ranked among\r\nthe fortunate. I wish she may be sensible of her lot.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the time of seeing you. Till Saturday I will hope the\r\nbest. I cannot extend my calculations beyond it; four days of your\r\nabsence is an age to come. My compliments to your chum, and who else\r\nyou please. _Pense avec tendresse de la vôtre_.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nChester, May 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more welcome than your affectionate letters by Mr.\r\nWickham. They met me on Tuesday evening, on our return from a tour\r\nthrough the mountains. I was for some hours transported home, to\r\npartake of that domestic tranquillity which you so feelingly paint.\r\nContinue to write if opportunity presents. They will cheer me in these\r\nrustic regions. If not, they will not be lost.\r\n\r\nThis being a rainy day, we have kept within doors. Tomorrow, if fair,\r\nwe resume the business of climbing mountains, which will probably be\r\nour employment till about the middle of next week. After which a week\r\nmore (at most) will finish the controversy.\r\n\r\nPay Moore nothing till I return, unless you see cause. Let him\r\nrough-cast, if he is confident of succeeding; but tell him I will not\r\npay him till I am convinced it will bear weather, and last.\r\n\r\nIf the sheriff of Bergen (Dey) calls for his money, I enclose a note\r\nwith a blank for the name. You must speak to either Malcom or Lente\r\nfor their assistance, unless you can think of something more\r\nconvenient, putting the matter in such light as your address shall\r\nthink proper. If for any reasons you should prefer to make use of\r\nPopham's name, do it. The person whose name is put in the note must\r\nendorse it, and the note be dated. Let one of the boys go over to Mrs.\r\nBaldwin for the certificate of the balance of the account, which, if\r\nobtained, a deduction must be made accordingly. Perhaps, by paying\r\nthree or four hundred pounds, Mr. Morris will consent to wait my\r\nreturn. Perhaps, at your instance, he will wait that time without any\r\npayment. All which is humbly submitted. I enclose two notes, that you\r\nmay take your choice.\r\n\r\nMr. Watrous's business respecting the land is not very material. If it\r\nshould have failed, you may inform him that I have long since filed a\r\ncaveat which will cover his claim.\r\n\r\nI bear the fatigues of our business to admiration. Have great\r\nappetite, and sleep sound about ten hours a night. I am already as\r\nblack as a Shawanese. You will scarce know me if I continue this\r\nbusiness a few days longer. Thank our dear children for their kind\r\nletters. But they are so afraid of tiring either me or themselves (I\r\nsuspect the latter), that they tell me few, very few, of those\r\ninteresting trifles which I want to know.\r\n\r\nLet T. give them any new steps he pleases, but not one before the\r\nothers. If any one is behind or less apt, more pains must be taken to\r\nkeep them on a par. This I give in charge to you.\r\n\r\nI fear you flatter me with respect to your health. You seem a little\r\nstudied on that score, which is not very natural to you when speaking\r\ntruth. But, if it is not true, it is surely your own fault. Go to bed\r\nearly, and do not fatigue your self with running about house. And upon\r\nno account any long walks, of which you are so fond, and for which you\r\nare so unfit. Simple diet will suit you best. Restrain all gout for\r\nintemperance till some future time not very distant.\r\n\r\nI do not _nor can_ promise myself all you promise me with respect to\r\nthe children. I have been too much mortified on that subject to remove\r\nit at once.\r\n\r\nThis is the last expedition of the kind I shall ever undertake; and\r\never since I have been here I have been planning ways to extricate\r\nmyself from it, but am defeated, and shall be absolutely detained\r\nprisoner till the business is concluded. Johnstone can give you an\r\naccount of my quarters and mode of life. You haunt me daily more and\r\nmore. I really fear I shall do little justice to the business which\r\nbrought me here.\r\n\r\nThe children must pardon my not writing. I have a number of\r\nmemorandums of business to make out for Johnstone. Thank them again\r\nfor their letters, and beg them not to be so churlish.\r\n\r\nLet one of the boys haunt Moore. But you surely can do it without\r\nletting him vex you, even supposing he does nothing. I had much rather\r\nthat should be the case than that you should be one minute out of\r\nhumour with him.\r\n\r\nThe girls must go on with Tetard in his own way till I come, when I\r\nwill set all right.\r\n\r\nIt is already late. I must be up at sunrise. Bon soir, ma chère amie.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR\r\n\r\nChester, 19th May, 2 o'clock P. M., 1785.\r\n\r\nWe have this day begun the examination of witnesses, which, together\r\nwith the arguments, will keep us the greater part, and probably the\r\nwhole, of next week. I find myself gaining strength exceedingly since\r\nmy return from New-York, though perfectly out of humour with the\r\nbusiness, the distance, and the delay.\r\n\r\nMy trip to New-York has quite ruined me for business. I cannot confine\r\nmy mind to it. I am literally homesick, and think of nothing else. A\r\nwitness attending in court informs me of his going to New-York as soon\r\nas his testimony is finished. I desert a moment to tell you that I am\r\nwholly yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 o'clock P. M., 19th May.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote you at two o'clock our court is adjourned till nine\r\nto-morrow. We go on briskly and in great good nature. If you were half\r\nas punctual or as fortunate (which shall I call it?), I should\r\nabsolutely fancy myself talking with you. It would be some\r\nindemnification for the distance and vexation. Make up in thinking of\r\nme, and taking care of yourself, what you omit in writing. Thine at\r\nall moments.\r\n\r\n\r\n9 o'clock at night, 19th May.\r\n\r\nA thousand thanks for your dear affectionate letter of Tuesday\r\nevening. I was just sitting pensively and half complaining of your\r\nremissness, when your letter is received and dispels every gloomy\r\nthought. I write this from the impulse of my feelings, and in\r\nobedience to your injunctions, having no opportunity in view.\r\n\r\nThe letters of our dear children are a feast. Every part of them is\r\npleasing and interesting. Le Jenne is not expected to be in New-York\r\nfor some weeks at least. I avoid the subject. I shudder at the idea of\r\nsuffering any thing to mar the happiness I promise myself.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of my return till the middle of next week. In\r\none of my letters I put it to the last of next week, but we have this\r\nday made unexpected progress. If we are equally fortunate and equally\r\ngood-natured, we may finish Wednesday night; but this is conjecture,\r\nand perhaps my impatience makes me too sanguine.\r\n\r\nI broke off at the bottom of the other page to pay some attention to\r\nthose who deserve much from me (our dear children). To hear that they\r\nare employed, that no time is absolutely wasted, is the most\r\nflattering of any thing that can be told me of them. It ensures their\r\naffection, or is the best evidence of it. It ensures, in its\r\nconsequences, every thing I am ambitions of in them. Endeavour to\r\npreserve regularity of hours; it conduces exceedingly to industry.\r\n\r\nI have just heard of a Mr. Brown who goes down by water. As I may not\r\nhave another opportunity, I hazard it by him. He promises to leave it\r\nat old Mr. Rutherford's. Our business goes on very moderately this\r\nmorning. Witnesses all tardy. We have adjourned for want of something\r\nto do. Melancholy and vexatious. It has given me a headache. We shall\r\nbe holden, I fear, all next week. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nChester, 8 o'clock, 20th May, 1785.\r\n\r\nWorse and worse. During the whole day we have not been five hours at\r\nbusiness. Our witnesses are so aged, and many so remote, that they\r\nwill not be in till Monday, so that, at this rate, we shall eke out\r\nthe whole of next week. I have at no time been so completely out of\r\npatience; just now particularly, being a little churlish with my\r\nheadache, which, though not very severe, unfits me for any thing but\r\nwriting to you.\r\n\r\nI wrote you and the whole flock last evening, and added a line to you\r\nthis morning, and sent off the packet by a Mr. Brown, who goes by\r\nwater, and promised to deliver it him-self. He has business at old Mr.\r\nRutherford's. If he is punctual, don't forget him in thinking of the\r\nletters. Do say something that will make me a little more content with\r\nthis vexatious delay and imprisonment. I am prompted to write a\r\nhundred things which I dare not, for fear I shall not find a safe\r\nconveyance: that was particularly the case last evening and this\r\nmorning. It is perhaps fortunate, or I should spend too much time with\r\nyou in this way. I believe I do as it is. Adieu, a little while. I am\r\njust going to prepare some hot punch.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock.\r\n\r\nI have been till this minute making and sipping punch, and with great\r\nsuccess. It has thrown me into a perspiration, which obliges me to go\r\nto bed. I am very illy reconciled to leave you and bid you good-night,\r\nbut so says my hard lot.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\nI lay awake till after three o'clock this morning; then got up and\r\ntook a large dose of medicine. It was composed posed of laudanum,\r\nnitre, and other savoury drugs, which procured me sleep till now: have\r\nno headache; must eat breakfast, and away to court as fast as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSaturday Evening.\r\n\r\nEvery thing almost stands still. I begin to despair of getting away. I\r\nam sure the whole of next week will not finish our business at the\r\npresent rate. To make it more tedious and disagreeable, some of us are\r\nless good-humoured than at first. Not a line from you since that I\r\nhave mentioned. I can find no opportunity for this. I am too vexed to\r\nutter one sentiment.\r\n\r\nSunday, 22d May.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity for this scrawl yet. I begin to be tired of seeing it,\r\nand wish it gone for this reason; and also, because I try to persuade\r\nmyself you would be glad to receive it.\r\n\r\nTo-day we have fine scope to reflect how much better we might have\r\nemployed it, had we been active in our business last week. I find the\r\nwhole might have been finished by yesterday (if the witnesses on both\r\nsides had been ready) as well as a month hence.\r\n\r\nMy room is a kind of rendezvous for our side: have seldom, therefore,\r\ntime either to think or write, unless at night or early in the\r\nmorning. Judge Yates concludes to give us a few days of his company,\r\nand to accept of a room with us. The coming of Le Jeune uncertain; not\r\nprobably till fall. You will receive a pail of butter, perhaps, with\r\nthis. I have been contracting for the year.\r\n\r\nHave you done running up and down stairs? How do you live, sleep, and\r\namuse yourself? I wish, if you have leisure (or, if you have not, make\r\nit), you would read the Abbé Mably's little book on the Constitution\r\nof the United States. St. John has it in French, which is much better\r\nthan a translation. This, you see, will save me the trouble of reading\r\nit; and I shall receive it with much more emphasis par la bouche\r\nd'amour. Adieu. I seal this instantly, lest I be tempted to write\r\nmore. Again adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May 22d, 1785.\r\n\r\nYour letter by Mr. Bayard was brought me on Saturday, and the first I\r\nhad received since the one by Mr. Marvin till to-day. Mr. Brown very\r\npunctually and civilly came with your welcome packet of Thursday, nine\r\no'clock. It was just before dinner; the children were dispersed at\r\ndifferent employments. I furnished the mantelpiece with the contents\r\nof the packet. When dinner was served up they were called. You know\r\nthe usual eagerness on this occasion. They were all seated but Bartow,\r\nwhen he espied the letters; the surprise, the joy, the exclamations\r\nexceed description. The greatest stoic would have forgot himself. A\r\nsilent tear betrayed me no _philosopher_. A most joyous repast\r\nsucceeded. We talked of our happiness, of our first of blessings, our\r\nbest of papas. I enjoyed, my Aaron, the only happiness that could\r\naccrue from your absence. It was a momentary compensation; the only\r\none I ever experienced. Your letters always afford me a singular\r\nsatisfaction;--a sensation entirely my own; this was peculiarly so. It\r\nwrought strangely on my mind and spirits. My Aaron, it was replete\r\nwith tenderness! with the most lively affection. I read and re-read,\r\ntill afraid I should get it by rote, and mingle it with common ideas;\r\nprofane the sacred pledge. No; it shall not be. I will economize the\r\nboon. I will limit the recreation to those moments of retirement\r\ndevoted to thee. Of a sudden I found myself unusually fatigued. I\r\nreflected on the cause, and soon found I had mounted the stairs much\r\noftener than I could possibly have done on any other occasion.\r\n\r\nI am vexed with my last letter to you; 'tis impossible for me to\r\ndisguise a single feeling or thought when I am writing or conversing\r\nwith the friend of my heart. I hope you have attended only to the last\r\nparagraph, and avoided all unnecessary anxiety for her who wishes to\r\nbe a constant source of pleasure to thee. I have been in good health\r\nsince Saturday morning. Since yesterday, unusually gay and happy;\r\nanticipating a thousand pleasures, studying every little arrangement\r\nthat can contribute to thy comfort. This wet weather is a bar to any\r\nessential progress. The walls are still too damp to admit of either\r\npaint or paper. I have a bed ready for the judge; _ne vous genez pas\r\nlâ-dessus_. I am afraid some foolish reflections in my last will\r\nembarrass you. Your affection and tenderness has put them to flight.\r\n\"Let nothing mar the promised bliss.\" Thy Theo. waits with\r\ninexpressible impatience to welcome the return of her truly beloved.\r\nEvery domestic joy shall decorate his mansion. When Aaron smiles,\r\nshall Theo. frown? Forbid it every guardian power.\r\n\r\nLe Jeune perplexes me no longer. I am provoked with myself for having\r\nrepeated it to you. Your dear little Theo. grows the most engaging\r\nchild you ever saw. She frequently talks of, and calls on, her dear\r\npapa. It is impossible to see her with indifference. All moves as you\r\nwish it. All count the passing hours till thy return. Remember, I am\r\nin good health and spirits; that I expect the same account of yours.\r\nTo think of me affectionately is my first command; to write me so, the\r\nsecond. Hasten to share the happiness of thy much loved and much\r\nloving\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 28th, 1785.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed was to have gone yesterday, but the intended bearer\r\ndisappointed me. Young ---- and his companions have just left us; at\r\ntasting your Madeira he pronounced you a d----d clever fellow. Your\r\nmerit increased with the number of glasses; they went away in\r\ngood-humour with themselves and the hostess. O my love, how earnestly\r\nI pray that our children may never be driven from your paternal\r\ndirection. Had you been at home to-day, you would have felt as fervent\r\nin this prayer as your Theo. Our children were impressed with utter\r\ncontempt for their guest. This gave me real satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI really believe, my dear, few parents can boast of children whose\r\nminds are so prone to virtue. I see the reward of our assiduity with\r\ninexpressible delight, with a gratitude few experience. My Aaron, they\r\nhave grateful hearts; some circumstances prove it, which I shall\r\nrelate to you with singular pleasure at your return. I pity A. C. from\r\nmy heart. She will feel the folly of an over zeal to accumulate.\r\nBartow's assiduity and faithfullness is beyond description. My health\r\nis not worse. I have been disappointed in a horse; shall have Pharaoh\r\nto-morrow. Frederick is particularly attentive to my health; indeed,\r\nnone of them are deficient in tenderness. All truly anxious for papa's\r\nreturn; we fix Tuesday, beyond a doubt, but hope impossibilities.\r\n\r\nI had a thousand things to write, but the idea of seeing you banishes\r\nevery other thought. I fear much the violent exertions you are obliged\r\nto make will injure your health. Remember how dear, how important it\r\nis to the repose, to the life of\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 29th, 1785.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tuesday evening came, I sent repeated messages to Cape's,\r\nwho persevered in the answer of there being no letter. I slept ill;\r\nfound my health much worse in the morning; rode out; in spite of\r\nexercise, continued ill till your dear letter was handed me. I\r\nimmediately called for refreshment, and imagined I had recovered my\r\nhealth; my sensations still tell me so. Ten thousand thanks for the\r\nbest prescription that ever physician invented. I ride daily;\r\nbreakfasted with Clem. Clarke this morning, who has scarce a trait of\r\nhimself. He neither knows nor cares for anybody but his son, who is\r\nthree years and a half old, fair hair, but not handsome; much\r\nhumoured; is introduced as a pet of the first value. Aunt more in\r\ntemper than was expected. He dines here to-morrow with the two Blakes.\r\nI felt no other compulse to notice them than your wish.\r\n\r\nOur little daughter's health has improved beyond my expectations. Your\r\ndear Theodosia cannot hear you spoken of without an apparent\r\nmelancholy; insomuch that her nurse is obliged to exert her invention\r\nto divert her, and myself avoid to mention you in her presence. She\r\nwas one whole day indifferent to every thing but your name. Her\r\nattachment is not of a common nature; though this was my opinion, I\r\navoided the remark, when Mr. Grant observed it to me as a singular\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nYou see I have followed your example in speaking first of myself. I\r\nesteemed it a real trait of your affection, a sympathy in the\r\nfeelings, the anxiety of your Theo., who had every fear for your\r\nhealth; more than you would allow her to express.\r\n\r\nThe garden wall is begun. I fear the front pavement will not answer\r\nyour intention. I write you again tomorrow. Much love awaits thee.\r\nThine, unchangeably,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 25th September, 1785.\r\n\r\nYour dear letter of Saturday morning has just reached me. I was\r\nrelieved, delighted, till the recollection of the storm you have since\r\nweathered took place. How have you borne it? Ten thousand fears alarm\r\nme. I pursued thee yesterday, through wind and rain, till eve, when,\r\nfatigued, exhausted, shivering, thou didst reach thy haven, surrounded\r\nwith inattention, thy Theo. from thee. Thus agitated, I laid my head\r\nupon a restless pillow, turning from side to side, when thy kindred\r\nspirit found its mate. I beheld my much-loved Aaron, his tender eyes\r\nfixed kindly on me; they spake a body wearied, wishing repose, but not\r\nsick. This soothed my troubled spirit: I slept tolerably, but dare not\r\ntrust too confidently. I hasten to my friend to realize the delightful\r\nvision; naught but thy voice can tranquillize my mind. Thou art the\r\nconstant subject of love, hope, and fear. The girls bewail the\r\nsufferings of their dear papa; the boys wish themselves in his place;\r\nFrederick frets at the badness of the horse; wishes money could put\r\nhim in thy stead. The unaffected warmth of his heart delights me. If\r\naught can alleviate thy absence, 'tis these testimonies of gratitude\r\nand affection from the young and guileless to the best of parents.\r\nThey feel the hand that blesses them, and love because they are\r\nblessed. Thy orders shall be attended to. Mamma joins in the warmest\r\nassurances of sincere affection. Theodosia and Sally in perfect\r\nhealth. Beyond expression,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 27th September, 1785.\r\n\r\nI have counted the hours till evening; since that, the minutes, and am\r\nstill on the watch; the stage not arrived: it is a cruel delay. Your\r\nhealth, your tender frame, how are they supported! Anxiety obliterates\r\nevery other idea; every noise stops my pen; my heart flutters with\r\nhope and fear; the pavement from this to Cape's [4] is kept warm by\r\nthe family; every eye and ear engrossed by expectation; my mind is in\r\ntoo much trepidation to write. I resume my pen after another\r\nmessenger, in vain. I will try to tell you that those you love are\r\nwell; that the boys are very diligent; Ireson gone to Westchester. My\r\nnew medicine will, I flatter myself, prove a lucky one. Sally\r\namazingly increased. Fream at work at the roof. He thinks it too flat\r\nto be secured. The back walls of the house struck through with the\r\nlate rain. M.Y. still at Miss W. You must not expect to find dancing\r\non Thursday night. I should think it a degree of presumption to make\r\nthe necessary preparations without knowing the state of your health.\r\nShould this account prove favourable, I still think it best to delay\r\nit, as the stage is very irregular in its return. That of Saturday did\r\nnot arrive till Sunday morning; it brought an unfavourable account of\r\nthe roads. Thus you probably would not partake, nor would I wish\r\nspectators to check my vigilance, or divide that attention which is\r\never insufficient when thou art the object. O, my Aaron, how impatient\r\nI am to welcome thy return; to anticipate thy will, and receive thy\r\nloved commands. The clock strikes eleven. No stage. My letter must go.\r\nI have been three hours writing, or attempting to write, this\r\nimperfect scrawl. The children desire me to speak their affection.\r\nMamma will not be forgot; she especially shares my anxiousness. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, October 30th, 1785. I have received your two affectionate\r\nletters. The enclosed was intended to have been sent by the stage\r\nwhich I met on my way up; but, by untoward accidents (needless to\r\ndetail), yet lies by me. My disorder has left me almost since I left\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThe person with whom I had business had gone from this place before my\r\narrival, so that I should have been, ere this, on my return, but that\r\nI have suffered myself to be engaged in two land causes (Van Hoesen\r\nand Van Rensselaer), which begin to-morrow, and will probably last the\r\nwhole week. I am retained for Van Hoesen, together with J. Bay and P.\r\nW. Yates. Such able coadjutors will relieve me of the principal\r\nburden. You may judge with what reluctance I engaged in a business\r\nwhich will detain me so long from all that is dear and lovely. I dare\r\nnot think on the period I have yet to be absent. I feel it in some\r\nsort a judgment for the letters written by the girls to N.W.\r\n\r\nYour account of your health is very suspicious; you are not particular\r\nenough; you say nothing of the means you use to restore yourself;\r\nwhether you take exercise, or how you employ your time.\r\n\r\nI shall probably leave this on Sunday next; my horse will not take me\r\nhome in three days. I fear I shall not see you till Wednesday morning\r\nof next week; perhaps not even then, for I am engaged to attend the\r\ncourt at Bedford on Tuesday of next week. You shall hear again by the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWill not these continued rains deprive us of the pleasure of the\r\npromised visit of the W.'s? How is it possible you can write me such\r\nshort letters, having so much leisure, and surrounded with all that\r\ncan interest me? Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 2d November, 1785.\r\n\r\nI have lived these three days upon the letters I expected this\r\nevening, and behold the stage without a line! I have been through the\r\nrain, and dark, and mud, hunting up every passenger to catechise them\r\nfor letters, and can scarce yet believe that I am so totally\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nOur trial, of which I wrote you on Sunday, goes on moderately. It will\r\ncertainly last till twelve o'clock on Saturday night; longer it\r\ncannot, that being the last hour of court. Of course, I leave this on\r\nSunday; shall be detained at Westchester till about Thursday noon, and\r\nbe home on Friday. This is my present prospect; a gloomy one, I\r\nconfess; rendered more so by your unpardonable silence. I have a\r\nthousand questions to ask, but why ask of the dumb?\r\n\r\nI am quite recovered. The trial in which I am engaged is a fatiguing\r\none, and in some respects vexatious. But it puts me in better humour\r\nto reflect that you have just received my letter of Sunday, and are\r\nsaying or thinking some good-natured things of me. Determining to\r\nwrite any thing that can amuse and interest me; every thing that can\r\natone for the late silence, or compensate for the hard fate that\r\ndivides us.\r\n\r\nSince being here I have resolved that you in future accompany me on\r\nsuch excursions, and I am provoked to have yielded to your idle fears\r\non this occasion. I have told here frequently, within a day or two,\r\nthat I was never so long from home before, till, upon counting days, I\r\nfind I have been frequently longer. I am so constantly anticipating\r\nthe duration of this absence, that when I speak of it I realize the\r\nwhole of it.\r\n\r\nLet me find that you have done justice to yourself and me. I shall\r\nforgive none the smallest omission on this head. Do not write by the\r\nMonday stage, or rather, do not send the letter you write, as it is\r\npossible I shall leave the stage-road in my way to Bedford.\r\n\r\nAffectionately adieu,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Major Popham, fifty-four years after the date of this letter,\r\nattended as a pall-bearer the funeral of Colonel Burr, the friend of\r\nhis youth.\r\n\r\n2.

BURR\r\n\r\nNew-York, August, 1786.\r\n\r\nYour letter was faithfully handed us by the boy from Hall's. Bartow\r\nhas enclosed the papers. Those you mentioned to me on the night of\r\nyour departure I cannot forward, as I have forgot the names of the\r\nparties, and they cannot guess them in the office from my description,\r\nI hope the disappointment will not be irreparable.\r\n\r\nIf you finish your causes before court is over, cannot you look at us,\r\neven should you return to the manor? The two girls followed you to the\r\nstagehouse, saw you seated and drive off. Frederick's tooth prevented\r\nhis attendance. My heart is full of affection, my head too barren to\r\nexpress it. I am impatient for evening; for the receipt of your dear\r\nletter; for those delightful sensations which your expressions of\r\ntenderness alone can excite. Dejected, distracted with out them;\r\nelated, giddy even to folly with them; my mind, never at medium,\r\nclaims every thing from your partiality.\r\n\r\nI have just determined to take a room at aunt Clarke's till Sally\r\nrecovers her appetite; by the advice of the physician, we have changed\r\nher food from vegetable to animal. A change of air may be equally\r\nbeneficial. You shall have a faithful account, I leave town at six\r\nthis evening. All good angels attend thee. The children speak their\r\nlove. Theodosia has written to you, and is anxious lest I should omit\r\nsending it. Toujours la vôtre,\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, August, 1786.\r\n\r\nYour letter of Thursday evening was stuffed into one of the office\r\npapers, so that I did not find it for half an hour after I received\r\nthe packet, during all which time I had the pleasure of abusing you\r\nstoutly. But I had only prepared myself for the most delightful\r\nsurprise. I apologized with great submission.\r\n\r\nWhy are you so cautiously silent as to our little Sally? You do not\r\nsay that she is better or worse; from which I conclude she is worse. I\r\nam not wholly pleased with your plan of meat diet. It is recommended\r\nupon the idea that she has no disorder but a general debility. All the\r\ndisorders of this season are apt to be attended with fevers, in which\r\ncase animal diet is unfriendly. I beg you to watch the effects of this\r\nwhim with great attention. So essential a change will certainly have\r\nvisible effects. Remember, I do not absolutely condemn, because I do\r\nnot know the principles, but am fearful.\r\n\r\nEvery minute of my time is engrossed to repair the loss of my little\r\nbook. Thank the boys for their attention to the business I left them\r\nin charge. I wish either of them had given me a history of what is\r\ndoing in the office, and you of what is doing in the family. The girls\r\nI know to be incorrigibly lazy, and therefore expect nothing from\r\nthem. The time was--but I have no leisure to reflect.\r\n\r\nThine,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, August, eleven o'clock at night, 1786.\r\n\r\nI have this day your letter by my express. I am sorry that you and\r\nothers perplex yourselves with that office nonsense. Am too fatigued\r\nand too busy to say more of it. We began our Catskill causes this\r\nmorning, and have this minute adjourned to meet at seven in the\r\nmorning. We shall be engaged at the same disagreeable rate till\r\nSaturday evening. I think our title stands favourably; but the jury\r\nare such that the verdict will be in some measure hazardous. I have\r\njudgment for Maunsel against Brown, after a laboured argument. Inform\r\nhim, with my regards.\r\n\r\nSince writing thus far, I have your affectionate letter by the stage,\r\nwhich revives me. I shall not go to the manor. But, if I succeed in\r\nour causes, shall be obliged to go to Catskill to settle with the\r\ntenants, make sales, &c. Of this you cannot know till Tuesday evening.\r\n\r\nI am wrong to say that I shall not go to the manor. I am obliged to\r\nattend a Court of Chancery there. The chancellor had gone hence before\r\nmy arrival. I cannot be home till Thursday evening. I hope your next\r\nwill be of the tenour of the last. Your want of cheerfullness is the\r\nleast acceptable of any token of affection you can give me. Good\r\nangels guard and preserve you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November, 1787.\r\n\r\nWhat language can express the joy, the gratitude of Theodosia? Stage\r\nafter stage without a line. Thy usual punctuality gave room for every\r\nfear; various conjectures filled every breast. One of our sons was to\r\nhave departed tomorrow in quest of the best of friends and fathers.\r\nThis morning we waited the stage with impatience. Shrouder went\r\nfrequently before it arrived; at length returned--_no letter._ We were\r\nstruck dumb with disappointment. Bartow set out to inquire who were\r\nthe passengers; in a very few minutes returned exulting,--a packet\r\nworth the treasures of the universe. Joy brightened every face; all\r\nexpressed their past anxieties; their present happiness. To enjoy was\r\nthe first result. Each made choice of what they could best relish.\r\nPorter, sweet wine, chocolate, and sweetmeats made the most delightful\r\nrepast that could be shared without thee. The servants were made to\r\nfeel _their lord was well_, are at this instant toasting his health\r\nand bounty; while the boys are obeying thy dear commands, thy\r\nTheodosia flies to speak her heartfelt joys:--her Aaron safe, mistress\r\nof the heart she adores; can she ask more? has Heaven more to grant?\r\n\"_Plus que jamais à vous_,\" dost thou recollect it? Do I read right? I\r\ncan't mistake; I read it everywhere; 'tis stamped on the blank paper;\r\nI sully the impression with reluctance; I know not what I write. You\r\ntalk of long absence. I stoop not to dull calculations; thou hast\r\njudged it best; thy breast breathes purest flame. What greater\r\nblessing can await me? Every latent spark is kindled in my soul. My\r\nimagination is crowded with ideas; they leave me no time for\r\nutterance; _plus que jamais_; but for Sally, I should set out\r\nto-morrow to meet you. I must dress and visit to-morrow. I have heard\r\nnothing of the W.s. Our two dear pledges have an instinctive knowledge\r\nof their mother's bliss. They have been awake all the evening I have\r\nthe youngest in my arms. Our sweet prattler exclaims at every noise,\r\nThere's dear papa, and runs to meet him. I pursue the medicine I began\r\nwhen you left us, and believe it efficacious. Exercise costs me a\r\ncrown a day; our own horse disabled by the nail which penetrated the\r\njoint. I have grown less, and better pleased with myself; feel\r\nconfident of your approbation. W. hastens the first assembly. F.\r\nfeigns herself lame, that she may not accompany M., who submits to\r\nevery little meanness, and bears all hints with insensibility. Has\r\ncalled here once. Clement sailed on Monday.\r\n\r\nYour remark on the shortness of my letters is flattering. This is the\r\nlast you shall complain of. My spirits and nerves coincide in asking\r\nrepose. Your daughter commands it. Our dear children join in the\r\nstrongest assurances of honest love. Mamma will not be forgotten.\r\nSweet sleep attend thee. Thy Theo.'s spirit shall preside. I wish you\r\nmay find this scrawl as short at reading as I have at writing. I am\r\nsurprised to find myself obliged to enclose it. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, Wednesday, November, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy health is better. As I fondly believe this the most interesting\r\nintelligence I can give thee, I make it my preamble. What would I not\r\ngive to have but those four small words from thee? Though I had but\r\nlittle hope, I found myself involuntarily counting the passing hours.\r\nMy messenger met the stage at the door. I need not relate his success.\r\nI fancy many ills from the situation of your health when you left\r\nhome, and pray ardently they may prove merely fanciful. I have still\r\nthree tedious days to the next stage, when a line of affection shall\r\nrepay all my anxieties. Ireson returned to-day. The poor boys have\r\nreally been models of industry. They write all day and evening, and\r\nsometimes all night, nor allow themselves time to powder.\r\n\r\nI feel as though my guardian angel had forsaken me. I fear every thing\r\nbut ghosts. Tell me, Aaron, why do I grow every day more tenacious of\r\nthy regard? Is it possible my affection can increase? Is it because\r\neach revolving day proves thee more deserving? Surely, thy Theo.\r\nneeded no proof of thy goodness. Heaven preserve the patron of my\r\nflock; preserve the husband of my heart; teach me to cherish his love,\r\nand to deserve the boon.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPoughkeepsie, 28th June, 1788.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the stage will pass through this place. Your letters\r\nwill not come to me till the morning, so that I can only thank you for\r\nthem, and the kind things they contain, by anticipation. I have\r\nalready read them in the same way, and therefore do thank you for\r\nthem, _de plein coeur_. I have a convenient room for my business in\r\none house, board at a different house, and bad lodgings at a third\r\nhouse. This is, indeed, not so convenient an arrangement as might be\r\nwished; but I could not procure these different accommodations at less\r\nthan three houses in this metropolis and seat of government.\r\n\r\nAs the boys will wish to know something of the progress of business\r\nhere, tell them that the cause of Freer and Van Vleeck has been this\r\nday put off by the defendants, on payment of costs, on an affidavit of\r\nthe want of papers. In Noxon's cause I have a verdict for thirty-four\r\npounds. The evidence clearly entitled Mr. Livingston to three or four\r\nhundred pounds, and so was the charge of the judge; but landlords are\r\nnot popular or favoured in this county. I am now going to court to\r\ndefend an action of trespass, in which I have been employed here; and\r\nshall try Mr. Lansing's cause to-morrow, which will close my business\r\nhere. With how much regret I shall go further from home. Kiss our dear\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPoughkeepsie, 29th June, 1788.\r\n\r\nI have sat an hour at the door watching the arrival of the stage. At\r\nlength it comes, and your dear packet is handed to me just in season\r\nto be acknowledged by Mr. Johnstone. He will tell you of the further\r\nprogress of my business and my intended movements. I go this evening\r\nto Rhinebeck. How wishfully I look homeward. I like your industry, and\r\nwill certainly reward it as you shall direct.\r\n\r\nMy time is much engrossed. My health perfectly good. You say nothing\r\nof yours; but your industry is a good omen. You can write to me by\r\nMonday's stage, directed to be forwarded to me from Rhinebeck. I shall\r\nbe then at Kingston. Much love to the smiling little girl. I received\r\nher letter, but not the pretty things. I continually plan my return\r\nwith childish impatience, and fancy a thousand incidents which render\r\nit more interesting. Reserve your health and spirits, and I shall not\r\nbe deceived.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, August 7th, 1788.\r\n\r\nOh Theo.! there is the most delightful grove--so darkened with\r\n_weeping willows_, that at noonday a _susceptible_ fancy like yours\r\nwould mistake it for a bewitching moonlight evening. These\r\nsympathizing willows, too, exclude even the prying eye of curiosity.\r\nHere no rude noise interrupts the softest whisper. Here no harsher\r\nsound is heard than the wild cooings of the gentle dove, the gay\r\nthresher's animated warbles, and the soft murmurs of the passing\r\nbrook. Really, Theo., it is _charming_.\r\n\r\nI should have told you that I am speaking of Fort Johnson, where I\r\nhave spent a day. From this _amiable_ bower you ascend a gentle\r\ndeclivity, by a winding path, to a cluster of lofty oaks and locusts.\r\nHere nature assumes a more august appearance. The gentle brook, which\r\nmurmured soft below, here bursts a cataract. Here you behold the\r\nstately Mohawk roll his majestic wave along the lofty Apalachians.\r\nHere the mind assumes a nobler tone, and is occupied by sublimer\r\nobjects. What _there_ was tenderness, _here_ swells to rapture. It is\r\ntruly _charming_.\r\n\r\nThe windings of this enchanting brook form a lovely island, variegated\r\nby the most sportive hand of nature. This shall be yours. We will\r\nplant it with jessamines and woodbine, and call it Cyprus. It seems\r\nformed for the residence o£ the loves and the graces, and is therefore\r\nyours by the best of titles. It is indeed most _charming_.\r\n\r\nBut I could fill sheets in description of the beauties of this\r\nromantic place. We will reserve it for the subject of many an amusing\r\nhour. And besides being little in the habit of the sublime or\r\npoetical, I grow already out of breath, and begin to falter, as you\r\nperceive. I cannot, however, omit the most interesting and important\r\ncircumstance; one which I had rather communicate to you in this way\r\nthan face to face. I know that you was opposed to this journey to Fort\r\nJohnson. It is therefore with the greater regret that I communicate\r\nthe event; and you are not unacquainted with my inducements to it.\r\n\r\nIn many things I am indeed unhappy in possessing a singularity of\r\ntaste; particularly unhappy when that taste differs in any thing from\r\nyours. But we cannot control necessity, though we often persuade\r\nourselves that certain things are our choice, when in truth we have\r\nbeen unavoidably impelled to them. In the instance I am going to\r\nrelate, I shall not examine whether I have been governed by mere\r\nfancy, or by motives of expediency, or by caprice; you will probably\r\nsay the latter.\r\n\r\nMy dear Theo., arm yourself with all your fortitude. I know you have\r\nmuch of it, and I hope that upon this occasion you will not fail to\r\nexercise it. I abhor preface and preamble, and don't know why I have\r\nnow used it so freely. But I am well aware that what I am going to\r\nrelate needs much apology _from_ me, and will need much _to_ you. If I\r\nam the unwilling, the unfortunate instrument of depriving you of any\r\npart of your promised gayety or pleasure, I hope you are too generous\r\nto aggravate the misfortune by upbraiding me with it. Be assured (I\r\nhope the assurance is needless), that whatever diminishes your\r\nhappiness equally impairs mine. In short, then, for I grow tedious\r\nboth to you and myself; and to procrastinate the relation of\r\ndisagreeable events only gives them poignancy; in short, then, my dear\r\nTheo., the beauty of this same Fort Johnson, the fertility of the\r\nsoil, the commodiousness and elegance of the buildings, the great\r\nvalue of the mills, and the very inconsiderable price which was asked\r\nfor the whole, have _not_ induced me to purchase it, and probably\r\nnever will: in the confidence, however, of meeting your forgiveness,\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 26th October, 1788.\r\n\r\nI wrote you a few hours ago, and put the letter into the postofflce.\r\nLittle did I then imagine how much pleasure was near at hand for me.\r\nJudge Hobart has this minute arrived, and handed me your letter of\r\nMonday. I cannot thank you sufficiently for all the affection it\r\ncontains. Be assured it has every welcome which congenial affection\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\nThe headache with which I left New-York grew so extreme, that finding\r\nit impossible to proceed in the stage, the view of a vessel off\r\nTarrytown, under full sail before the wind, tempted me to go on board.\r\nWe reached West Point that night, and lay there at anchor near three\r\ndays. After a variety of changes from sloop to wagon, from wagon to\r\ncanoe, and from canoe to sloop again, I reached this place last\r\nevening. I was able, however, to land at Rhinebeck on Thursday\r\nevening, and there wrote you a letter which I suppose reached you on\r\nSaturday last.\r\n\r\nMy business in court will detain me till Saturday of this week, when I\r\npropose to take passage in sloop. I have just drunk tea with Mrs.\r\nFairlie, and her daughter, five days old. Thank Bartow for the papers\r\nby Judge Hobart. When I wrote him this evening I had not received\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, November, 1788.\r\n\r\nI received your affectionate letter just as I was going into court,\r\nand under the auspices of it have tried with success two causes. The\r\nbearer of this was my client in one of them, and is happy beyond\r\nmeasure at his success. Business has increased upon my hands since I\r\ncame here. My return seems daily more distant, but not to be regretted\r\nfrom any views but those of the heart.\r\n\r\nI hope you persevere in the regular mode of life which I pointed out\r\nto you. I shall be seriously angry if you do not. I think you had best\r\ntake less wine and more exercise. A walk twice round the garden before\r\nbreakfast, and a ride in the afternoon, will do for the present, and\r\nthis will be necessary to fit you for the journey to Long Island.\r\n\r\nA Captain Randolph will call with Mr. Mersereau: _c'est un soldat et\r\nhonnête homme, donnez eux à boire._ They will answer all your\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 23d November, 1788.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your obliging letter of the 19th. It is not, indeed,\r\nso long as I had hoped, but your reason for being concise is too\r\ningenious not to be admitted. I have, however, a persuasion that you\r\nare at this moment employed in the same manner that I am; and in the\r\nhope that your good intentions will not be checked by either want of\r\nhealth or want of spirits, I venture to expect a much longer letter by\r\nthe coming post.\r\n\r\nYour account of the progress of the measles is alarming. I am pleased\r\nto find that you yet keep your ground. It persuades me that,\r\nnotwithstanding what you have written, you do not think the hazard\r\nvery great. That disorder hath found its way to this city, but with no\r\nunfavourable symptoms. It is not spoken of as a thing to be either\r\nfeared or avoided.\r\n\r\nI have no prospect of being able to leave this place before this day\r\nweek, probably not so soon. You must, by return of post, assure me\r\nthat I shall find you in good health and spirits. This will enable me\r\nto despatch business and hasten my return. Kiss those who love me.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 26th November, 1788.\r\n\r\nThe unusual delay of the post deprives me of the pleasure of hearing\r\nfrom you this evening. This I regret the more, as your last makes me\r\nparticularly anxious for that which I expected by this post.\r\n\r\nI am wearied out with the most tedious cause I was ever engaged in.\r\nTo-morrow will be the eighth day since we began it, and it may\r\nprobably last the whole of this week. Write me whether any thing calls\r\nparticularly for my return so as to prevent my concluding my business\r\nhere. I am at a loss what to write until I have your answer to my\r\nletters, for which I am very impatient.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the year 1785 until the year 1788, Colonel\r\nBurr took but little part in the political discussions of the day. In\r\nthe year 1787 the opinion had become universal that the states could\r\nnot be kept together under the existing articles of confederation. On\r\nthe second Monday in May, 1787, a convention met in Philadelphia for\r\nthe avowed purpose of \"_revising the Articles of Confederation_,\" &c.\r\nOn the 28th of September following, that convention, having agreed\r\nupon a \"_new constitution_,\" ordered that the same be transmitted to\r\nthe several legislatures for the purpose of being submitted to a\r\nconvention of delegates, chosen in each state, for its adoption or\r\nrejection.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1788, the legislature of New-York met, and warm\r\ndiscussions ensued on the subject of the new constitution. These\r\ndiscussions arose on the question of calling a state convention.\r\nParties had now become organized. The friends of the new constitution\r\nstyled themselves _federalists_. Its opponents were designated\r\n_anti-federalists_. The latter denied the right of the general\r\nconvention to form a \"new constitution,\" and contended that they were\r\nlimited in their powers to \"revising and amending the Articles of\r\nConfederation.\" The former asserted that the general convention had\r\nnot transcended its powers.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, on this point, appears to have assumed a neutral stand;\r\nbut, in other respects, connected himself with what was termed the\r\nanti-federal party. He wished amendments to the constitution, and had\r\nreceived, in common with many others, an impression that the powers of\r\nthe federal government, unless more distinctly defined, would be so\r\nexercised as to divest the states of every attribute of sovereignty,\r\nand that on their ruins ultimately there would be erected a splendid\r\n_national_ instead of a _federal_ government.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1788, Colonel Burr was nominated by the anti-federalists of\r\nthe city of New-York as a candidate for the assembly. The feelings of\r\nthat day may be judged of by the manner in which the ticket was\r\nheaded. It was published in the newspapers and in handbills as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"The sons of liberty, who are again called upon to contend with the\r\n_sheltered aliens_, who have, by the courtesy of our country, been\r\npermitted to remain among us, will give their support to the following\r\nticket:--\r\n\r\n\"_William Deming, Melancton Smith, Marinus Willet, and Aaron Burr._\"\r\n\r\nThe federalists prevailed by an overwhelming majority. The strength of\r\nthe contending parties was in the ratio of about seven federalists (or\r\ntories) for one anti-federalist (or whig). Such were the political\r\ncognomens of the day. The federalists styled their opponents\r\n_anti-federalists_. The anti-federalists designated their opponents\r\n_tories_.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1789, there was an election for governor of the State of\r\nNew-York. The anti-federal party nominated George Clinton. A meeting\r\nof citizens, principally federalists, was held in the city of\r\nNew-York, and Judge Robert Yates was nominated in opposition to Mr.\r\nClinton. Mr. Yates was a firm and decided anti-federalist. He was\r\nknown to be the personal and political friend of Colonel Burr. At this\r\nmeeting a committee of correspondence was appointed. Colonel Hamilton\r\nand Colonel Burr were both members of this committee.\r\n\r\nIn their address recommending Judge Yates they state, that\r\nChief-justice Morris or Lieutenant-governor Van Courtlandt were the\r\nfavourite candidates of the federal party; but, for the sake of\r\nharmonizing conflicting interests, a gentleman (Mr. Yates), known as\r\nan anti-federalist, had been selected, and they respectfully recommend\r\nto Mr. Morris and Mr. Van Courtlandt to withdraw their names, and to\r\nunite in the support of Mr. Yates. This address was signed by\r\nAlexander Hamilton as chairman. Mr. Clinton, however, was re-elected.\r\n\r\nThis support of Judge Yates did not diminish Governor Clinton's\r\nconfidence in the political integrity, or lessen his respect for the\r\ntalents, of Colonel Burr. A few months after the election the governor\r\ntendered to him the office of attorney-general of the state. At first\r\nhe hesitated about accepting the appointment; but, on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, 1789, addressed his excellency as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR GEORGE CLINTON.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn case the office you were pleased to propose should be offered to\r\nme, I have, upon reflection, determined to accept it; at least until\r\nit shall be known upon what establishment it will be placed. My\r\nhesitation arose not from any dislike to the office, but from the\r\ncircumstances which I took the liberty to suggest in our conversation\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be\r\n\r\nYour excellency's obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of the above note, Governor Clinton nominated Colonel\r\nBurr to the council of appointment as attorney-general of the state,\r\nand the nomination was confirmed. This office was rather professional\r\nthan political. It was, however, at the time, highly important, and\r\nimposed the most arduous duties upon the incumbent. Under the new\r\nconstitution of the United States, after the organization of the\r\ngovernment, many intricate questions arose. To discriminate between\r\nthe claims upon the respective states and those upon the federal\r\ngovernment, often required close investigation and no inconsiderable\r\ndegree of legal astuteness. The claims of individuals who had been in\r\nthe service of the state during the war of the revolution, or who had\r\notherwise become creditors, were now presented for adjustment. There\r\nwere no principles settled by which their justice or legality could be\r\ntested. All was chaos; and the legislature was about to be overwhelmed\r\nwith petitions from every quarter for debts due, or for injuries\r\nalleged to have been sustained by individuals who had been compelled\r\nto receive depreciated money, or whose private property had been taken\r\nfor public use. In this dilemma the legislature passed an act\r\nauthorizing the appointment of commissioners to report on the subject.\r\nThe commissioners were Gerard Bancker, treasurer, Peter T. Curtenius,\r\nstate auditor, and Aaron Burr, attorney-general.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that Colonel Burr was attorney-general, the seat of\r\ngovernment was in the city of New-York. His official duties,\r\ntherefore, seldom required his absence from home, when his private\r\nbusiness, as a professional man, would not have rendered that absence\r\nnecessary. His correspondence, although more limited, lost none of its\r\ninterest, and miscellaneous selections from it are therefore\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 21st October, 1789.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST THEODOSIA,\r\n\r\nI have this moment received your letter of Sunday evening, containing\r\nthe account of your alarming accident and most fortunate rescue and\r\nescape. I thank Heaven for your preservation, and thank you a thousand\r\ntimes for your particular and interesting account of it.\r\n\r\nI left my sloop at Kinderhook on Monday morning, and came here that\r\nday in a wagon. I wrote you on the passage, and attempted to leave the\r\nletter at Poughkeepsie, but the wind not permitting us to stop, I went\r\non board a Rhinebeck sloop, and there found Mrs. Peter R. Livingston,\r\nwho offered to take charge of my letter.\r\n\r\nI am relieved from much anxiety by your management of certain\r\narrangements; I am glad M. W. is content. Mrs. Witbeck met with an\r\naccident a little similar to yours; but she lost only her cap and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to find that you anticipate as a pleasure that by this\r\npost you may write as much as you please. If you set no other bound to\r\nyour pen than my gratification, you will write me the history every\r\nday, not of your actions only (the least of which will be\r\ninteresting), but of your thoughts. I shall watch with eagerness and\r\nimpatience the coming of every stage. Let me not be disappointed; you\r\nhave raised and given confidence to these hopes. We lodge at a neat,\r\nquiet widow's, near the Recorder Gansevoort's. Sill invited us very\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 24th October, 1783.\r\n\r\nWith what pleasure have I feasted for three days past upon the letters\r\nI was to receive this evening. I was engaged in court when the stage\r\npassed. Upon the sound of it I left court and ran to the postoffice;\r\njudge of my mortification to find not a line from your hand. Surely,\r\nin the course of three days, you might have found half an hour to have\r\ndevoted to me. You well knew how much I relied on it; you knew the\r\npleasure it would have given me, and the disappointment and chagrin I\r\nshould feel from the neglect. I cannot, will not believe that these\r\nconsiderations have no weight with you. But a truce to complaints. I\r\nwill hope that you have written, and that some accident has detained\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nYour misfortunes so engrossed me, that I forgot to inquire about\r\nAugustine's horses; and to give a caution, which I believe is\r\nneedless, about the blank checks. Do not part with one till you see it\r\nfilled up with sum and date. T. P. is apt to make mistakes, and once\r\nlost a check which was by accident detected before it was presented\r\nfor payment. This is my fourth letter. Perhaps I write too much, and\r\nyou wish to give me an example of moderation.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 28th October, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe history of your sufferings, this moment received, is truly\r\nunexpected and affecting. My sympathy was wholly with your unfortunate\r\nleft hand. The distressing circumstances respecting your face must\r\ncertainly be owing to something more than the mere misfortune of your\r\nburn. I cannot help feeling a resentment which must not be in this way\r\nexpressed. I am sure your sufferings might have been prevented. I had\r\npromised myself that they were at an end many days ago.\r\n\r\nForgive my splenetic letter by the last post. I cannot tell you how\r\nmuch I regret it. When I was complaining and accusing you of neglect,\r\nyou were suffering the most excruciating pain; but I could not have\r\nimagined this unfortunate reverse. Impute my impatience to my anxiety\r\nto hear from you. I am pleased at the gayety of your letter. Do not\r\nthink a moment of the consequences which you apprehend from the wound.\r\nLet me only hear that you are relieved from pain, and I am happy. This\r\nis my fifth letter. Frederick is the laziest dog in the world for not\r\nhaving written me of your situation.\r\n\r\nYours, truly and affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nClaverack, 27th June, 1791.\r\n\r\nI have just arrived here, and find Mr. B. Livingston about to return\r\nto New-York. He informs me that he left home on Saturday, and sent you\r\nword that he was to meet me here. It was kind in him. I cannot say as\r\nmuch of the improvement you made of his goodness.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that you tell me nothing of Theo. I would by no means\r\nhave her writing and arithmetic neglected. It is the part of her\r\neducation which is of the most present importance. If Shepherd will\r\nnot attend her in the house, another must be had; but I had rather pay\r\nhim double than employ another. Is Chevalier still punctual? Let me\r\nknow whether you are yet suited with horses, and how?\r\n\r\nIn your letters, speak of Brooks and Ireson's attendance. I wish you\r\nwould often step into the office, and see as many as you can of the\r\npeople who come on business. Does young Mr. Broome attend? Other and\r\nmore interesting questions have been made and repeated in my former\r\nletters; I will therefore, at present, fatigue with no more\r\ninterrogatories. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 30th June, 1791.\r\n\r\nMy letter missed the post yesterday not from my neglect. It waited for\r\nBrooks's packet, which was not ready till the mail was gone. Mr. B.\r\nLivingston just handed me the one you intrusted to him. I was the more\r\npleased with it, as he accompanied it with the most favourabie account\r\nof your health I have received since your absence, and promises to\r\nforward this in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Edwardses dine with me; they had taken lodgings previous to their\r\narrival, in consequence of a report made them by the little Bodowins\r\n(who were at Mrs. Moore's last winter), that my house was too small\r\nand inconvenient to admit of a spare bed. I esteem it a lucky escape.\r\nIt would have been impossible for me to have borne the fatigue.\r\nCharlotte is worn out with sleepless nights, laborious days, and an\r\nanxious mind. Hannah constantly drunk. Except William, who is a mere\r\nwaiter, I have no servant.\r\n\r\nMy guests are come to dinner. I have solicited them, and shall again,\r\nto stay here; but, if they positively decline it, I will go to\r\nFrederick. I will steal a moment after dinner to add another page.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 2d.\r\n\r\nThe person Mr. Livingston expected to forward my letter by did not go,\r\nnor could I hear of an opportunity, till, this moment, Mr. Williams\r\noffered to take charge of this. I had arranged every thing to set out\r\nfor Frederick this morning, when a mortification was found to have\r\ntaken place on Charlotte's child, and she could not be moved. As I had\r\ncarted every thing on board, which I assure you was no small piece of\r\nbusiness, I sent Natie with the three younger children, and kept\r\nLouise and Theo to go with me, whenever this disagreeable event is\r\npast.\r\n\r\nTheo never can or will make the progress we would wish her while she\r\nhas so many avocations. I kept her home a week in hopes Shepherd would\r\nconsent to attend her at home, but he absolutely declined it, as his\r\npartners thought it derogatory to their dignity. I was therefore\r\nobliged to submit, and permit her to go as usual. She begins to\r\ncipher. Mr. Chevalier attends regularly, and I take care she never\r\nomits learning her French lesson. I believe she makes most progress in\r\nthis. Mr. St. Aivre never comes; he can get no fiddler, and I am told\r\nhis furniture, &c. have been seized by the sheriff. I don't think the\r\ndancing lessons do much good while the weather is so warm; they\r\nfatigue too soon. I have a dozen and four tickets on hand, which I\r\nthink will double in value at my return. As to the music, upon the\r\nfooting it now is she can never make progress, though she sacrifices\r\ntwo thirds of her time to it. 'Tis a serious check to her other\r\nacquirements. She must either have a forte-piano at home, or renounce\r\nlearning it. For these reasons I am impatient to go in the country.\r\nHer education is not on an advantageous footing at present. Besides,\r\nthe playfellows she has at home makes it the most favourable moment\r\nfor her to be at liberty a few weeks, to range and gain in health a\r\ngood foundation for more application at our return, when I hope to\r\nhave her alone; nay, I will have her alone. I cannot live so great a\r\nslave, and she shall not suffer. My time shall not be an unwilling\r\nsacrifice to others; it shall be hers. She shall have it, but I will\r\nnot use severity; and without it, at present, I can obtain nothing;\r\n'tis a bad habit, which she never deserves when I have her to myself.\r\nThe, moment we are alone she tries to amuse me with her improvement,\r\nwhich the little jade knows will always command my attention; but\r\nthese moments are short and seldom. I have so many trifling\r\ninterruptions, that my head feels as if I had been a twelvemonth at\r\nsea. I scarcely know what I speak, and much less what I write.\r\n\r\nWhat a provoking thing that I, who never go out, who never dress\r\nbeyond a decent style at home, should not have a leisure moment to\r\nread a newspaper. It is a recreation I have not had since you left\r\nhome, nor could I get an opportunity by water to send them to you.\r\nAlbany will be a more favourable situation for every conveyance. But I\r\ndon't understand why your lordship can't pay your obeisance at home in\r\nthis four week vacation. I think I am entitled to a reason.\r\n\r\nBrooks attends regularly. Ireson from six to twelve, and from two to\r\nsix, as punctual as possible. I should have made the office more my\r\nbusiness had I known it would have been agreeable to you. I shall be\r\nattentive for the future. Bartow is here every morning. Most people\r\neither choose to wait for him, or call at some appointed hour when he\r\ncan be here. Mr. Broome is here every day.\r\n\r\nGod knows the quality of this epistle; but the quantity I am certain\r\nyou won't complain of. 'Tis like throwing the dice--a mere game at\r\nhazard; like all gamblers, I am always in hopes the last will prove a\r\nlucky cast. Pray, in what consists the pleasure of a familiar\r\ncorrespondence? In writing without form or reflection your ideas and\r\nfeelings of the moment, trusting to the partiality of your friend\r\nevery imperfect thought, and to his candour every ill-turned phrase.\r\nSuch are the letters I love, and such I request of those I love. It\r\nmust be a very depraved mind from whom such letters are not\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nNeither the packet you left at Kingston, nor the money and greatcoat\r\nby Colonel Gausbeck, have yet reached me. I wish you could have passed\r\nthat leisure four weeks with me at Frederick's. How pleasant such a\r\nparty would have been. How much quiet we should have enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 3d.\r\n\r\nI was interrupted yesterday by the death of Charlotte's child. Though\r\na long-expected event, still the scene is painful. The mother's tears\r\nwere almost too much for me. I hope nothing new will occur to impede\r\nmy journey. I set off to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nI am not so sick as when I wrote you last, nor so well as when you\r\nleft me. I confess I have neglected the use of those medicines I found\r\nrelief from. The situation of my family has obliged me to neglect\r\nmyself, nor can I possibly use them at Frederick's. We shall be too\r\ncrowded. I will nevertheless take them with me. I live chiefly on ale.\r\nI buy very good for one dollar per dozen. I have had twenty-one dozen\r\nof your pipe of wine bottled. I think it very good.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your remembrance per post of 30th June. It was\r\nacceptable, though short. How is it possible you had nothing more to\r\nwrite? I know the head may be exhausted, but I was in hopes the heart\r\nnever could. I am surprised at your not getting my letters. I fear\r\nseveral have either gone to Albany or are lost. I shall, from this\r\nday, keep the dates. I wrote you last Sunday--so did Ireson.\r\n\r\nYou can have no idea how comfortable the house seems since the small\r\ntribe have left it. A few weeks' quiet would restore my head. It\r\nreally wants rest. You can't know how weak it is. I cannot guide a\r\nsingle thought. Those very trifling cares were ever more toilsome to\r\nme than important matters; they destroy the mind. But I am beginning\r\nanother sheet; I am sure you must be tired of this unconnected medley.\r\nI will bid you adieu.\r\n\r\nTheo. has begun to write several letters, but never finished one. The\r\nonly time she has to write is also the hour of general leisure, and,\r\nwhen once she is interrupted, there is no making her return to work. I\r\nhave nothing more to write, except that I am yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTHEO. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 17th July, 1791.\r\n\r\nI returned yesterday from Johnstown, worn down with heat, fatigue, and\r\nbad fare. It is some small consolation that these tedious journeys are\r\nnot wholly unproductive.\r\n\r\nAt Johnstown I was very unexpectedly and agreeably surprised by your\r\nletter of the 21st June, which was addressed to me at Kingston. It had\r\nbeen intrusted to an Irishman, whom I at length met pretty much by\r\naccident. It informs me of the villany of Frederick's servants, and of\r\nhis wanting a rib. The latter I have equally at heart with you, and\r\nnever lose sight of it; but, really, the big mother will not do; the\r\nfather is not much better--reputable and rich, but coarse and\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nOn my return to this place I found your letter of Wednesday morning. I\r\nfear the bad road near Pelham will discourage you from riding. As you\r\nare likely to make considerable use of it, would it not be worth while\r\nto have a few days' work done on it? About an hour after the receipt\r\nof the last-mentioned letter, I was made happy by the receipt of that\r\nof the 10th instant, which came by sloop. You seem fatigued and\r\nworried, your head wild and scarcely able to write, but do not name\r\nthe cause. Whatever it may have been, I am persuaded that nothing will\r\nso speedily and effectually remove such sensations as gentle exercise\r\n(or even if it is not gentle) in the open air. The extreme heat of the\r\nweather, and the uncommon continuance of it, have, I fear, interrupted\r\nyour good intentions on this head, especially as you are no friend to\r\nriding early. I wish you would alter this part (if it is any part) of\r\nyour system. Walking early is bad on account of the dew; but riding\r\ncan, I think, in such weather, be only practised with advantage early\r\nin the morning. The freshness of the air, and the sprightliness of all\r\nanimated nature, are circumstances of no trifling consequence. I have\r\nno letter from you by the last post, which put me almost out of\r\nhumour, notwithstanding the receipt of the three above mentioned\r\nwithin forty-eight hours, of which, however, the latest is a week old.\r\n\r\nI hope Theo. will learn to ride on horseback. Two or three hours a day\r\nat French and arithmetic will not injure her. Be careful of green\r\napples, &c.\r\n\r\nI have been persuaded to undertake a laborious piece of business,\r\nwhich will employ me diligently for about ten days. The eloquence\r\nwhich wrought upon me was principally money. I am now at wages. What\r\nsacrifices of time and pleasure do I make to this paltry\r\nobject--contemptible indeed in itself, but truly important and\r\nattractive as the means of gratifying those I love. No other\r\nconsideration could induce me to spend another day of my life in\r\nobjects in themselves uninteresting, and which afford neither\r\ninstruction nor amusement. They become daily more disgusting to me; in\r\nsome degree, perhaps, owing to my state of health, which is much as\r\nwhen I left New-York. The least fatigue brings a slight return of\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nYour exercise, your medicine, and your reading are three subjects upon\r\nwhich you have hitherto dwelt only in prospect. They must be all, in\r\nsome degree, within your power. I have a partiality for the little\r\nstudy as your bedroom. Say a word of each of these matters in your\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nContinue and multiply your letters to me. They are all my solace in\r\nthis irksome and laborious confinement. The six last are constantly\r\nwithin my reach. I read them once a day at least. Write me of all I\r\nhave requested, and a hundred things which I have not. You best know\r\nhow to please and interest.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPelham, 23d July, 1791.\r\n\r\nI have just now received your welcome letter of the 17th inst. The\r\npleasure imparted by so flattering a testimony of your good-will, was\r\ntempered with a large portion of alloy in the confession of your ill\r\nhealth. I was apprehensive travelling in the heat and bad\r\naccommodations would check your recovery. Do return home as soon as\r\npossible; or, rather, come to Pelham; try quiet, and the good air, and\r\nthe attention and friendship of those who love you. You may command\r\nBartow's attendance here whenever it suits you, and you have a\r\nfaithful envoy in Frederick, who will go post with your commands as\r\noften as you wish. It is, indeed, of serious consequence to you, to\r\nestablish your health _before you commence politician_: when once you\r\nget engaged, your industry will exceed your strength; your pride cause\r\nyou to forget yourself. But remember, you are not your own; there are\r\nthose who have stronger claims than ambition ought to have, or the\r\npublic can have.\r\n\r\nWhy did you undertake that very laborious task you mention? 'Tis\r\ncertain I have a great pleasure in spending money, but not when it is\r\naccompanied with the unpleasant reflection of sacrificing your health\r\nto the pursuit.\r\n\r\nTheo. is much better; she writes and ciphers from five in the morning\r\nto eight, and also the same hours in the evening. This prevents our\r\nriding at those hours, except Saturday and Sunday, otherwise I should\r\ncheerfully follow your directions, as I rise at five or six every day.\r\nTheo. makes amazing progress at figures. Though Louisa has worked at\r\nthem all winter, and appeared quite an adept at first, yet Theo. is\r\nnow before her, and assists her to make her sums. You will really be\r\nsurprised at her improvement. I think her time so well spent that I\r\nshall not wish to return to town sooner than I am obliged. She does\r\nnot ride on horseback, though Frederick has a very pretty riding horse\r\nhe keeps for her; but were she to attempt it now, there would be so\r\nmuch jealousy, and so many would wish to take their turn, that it\r\nwould really be impracticable. But we have the best substitute\r\nimaginable. As you gave me leave to dispose of the old wheels as I\r\npleased, I gave them as my part towards a wagon; we have a good plain\r\nDutch wagon, that I prefer to a carriage when at Pelham, as the\r\nexercise is much better. We ride in numbers and are well jolted, and\r\nwithout dread. 'Tis the most powerful exercise I know. No Spring\r\nseats; but, like so many pigs, we bundle together on straw. Four miles\r\nare equal to twenty. It is really an acquisition. I hope you will see\r\nour little girl rosy cheeked and plump as a partridge. I rejoice with\r\nyou at the poor major's return. I grow lazy, and love leisure; and,\r\nabove all, the privilege of disposing of my own time with quiet and\r\nretirement when it suits me. I have also made choice of the little\r\nstudy for my own apartment; but with so large a family, and so few\r\nconveniences, there can be no place of retirement. The vacation hours\r\nof school, and Sunday, there is a constant hurlyburly, and every kind\r\nof noise, though it is really much better than I feared. I take all\r\nthings as philosophically as I know how; provided I have no real evil\r\nto struggle with, I pass on with the tumult. I am now writing in the\r\nmidst of it. The variety of sounds almost dim my sight; but I write\r\non, and trust to good luck more than reflection, I find so much to say\r\nthat I need not hesitate for matter, though I might for propriety of\r\nspeaking. My spirits are better: as to industry, it is of a very\r\nflighty kind, and so variegated that it will not bear description. It\r\nrequired some attention to get matters _en train_: it was like moving.\r\nMy disorder I have not, nor am not able to attend to; 'tis attended\r\nwith so many disagreeable circumstances that it is not practicable at\r\npresent; but my general health is greatly improved, and my head much\r\nrelieved. The hint you give respecting a rib for Frederick is more\r\nelating than I can express. You say nothing of B. That part of my\r\npetition was not less interesting. I humbly pray your honour may take\r\ninto consideration the equity and propriety of my prayer, and grant me\r\nnot only a hearing, but deign to give due consideration to the prayer\r\nof your humble petitioner, being confident she will find grace and\r\nmercy from your tribunal, with a full grant of all your endeavours to\r\nreinstate her in that desired tranquillity whose source is in your\r\nbreast, to that happiness which is suspended on your will.\r\n\r\nThe heat and drought exceed all recollection. The town is extremely\r\nunhealthy. It is fortunate we are here. There is always air--never\r\nheat enough to incommode one. I am certain the child would have\r\nsuffered in town; she was much reduced; her voice and breast were\r\nweak. Adieu. I think you must be tired before this. Attend to\r\nyourself. If you love us, you will. You will for your\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPelham, 27th July, 1791.\r\n\r\nI have lost some of your letters, and I make no doubt some of mine\r\nhave met the same fate; for this reason I am discouraged trusting any\r\nmore to the stage. I am obliged to wait with all the patience I can\r\ncommand till the boat returns from town. I have no prospect at present\r\nof forwarding this. I write to repeat my thanks for yours of the 17th.\r\nIt is the last I have received. I read it frequently, and always with\r\nnew pleasure. I was disappointed at not having a line from you by the\r\nSaturday's mail. It is not fair to stand on punctilio, when you know\r\nthe disadvantages attending my situation here. You ought to be doubly\r\nattentive _pour me soulager_. It is not so practicable to send some\r\nmiles from home twice a week as you imagine.\r\n\r\nPoor Dr. Wright had his house two days ago burnt to the ground, and\r\nall the furniture, with every article of clothing both of themselves\r\nand the children. She is very disconsolate, and much to be pitied. We\r\ncertainly see the old proverb very often verified. \"That misfortunes\r\nnever come singly,\" that poor little woman is a proof. They talk of a\r\ngeneral war in Europe; in that case _le moulin_ will be an object. We\r\nwait your return to determine all things. The Emperess of Russia is as\r\nsuccessful as I wish her. What a glorious figure will she make on the\r\nhistorical page! Can you form an idea of a more happy mortal than she\r\nwill be when seated on the throne of Constantinople? How her ambition\r\nwill be gratified; the opposition and threats of Great Britain, &c.\r\nwill increase her triumph. I wish I had wit and importance enough to\r\nwrite her a congratulatory letter. The ladies should deify her, and\r\nconsecrate a temple to her praise. It is a diverting thought, that the\r\nmighty Emperor of the Turks should be subdued by a woman. How enviable\r\nthat she alone should be the avenger of her sex's wrongs for so many\r\nages past. She seems to have awakened Justice, who appears to be a\r\nsleepy dame in the cause of injured innocence.\r\n\r\nAm I dreaming, or do you leave home again before you go to\r\nPhiladelphia? Tell all your intentions; I love to plan and arrange.\r\nOur blind state here is one of our most vexatious evils; that state of\r\nuncertainty damps every view, and converts our most pleasing hopes\r\ninto the most disappointing reflections.\r\n\r\nHy! ho! for the major. [1] I am tired to death of living in a nursery.\r\nIt is very well to be amused with children at an idle hour; but their\r\ninterruption at all times is insupportable to a person of common\r\nreflection. My nerves will not admit of it. You judge right as to the\r\nroads on the Neck.\r\n\r\nTheodosia is quite recovered, and makes great progress at ciphering. I\r\ncannot say so much in favour of her writing. I really think she lost\r\nthe last month she went to Shepherd. She has not improved since last\r\nspring. She is sensible of it, is the reason she is not very desirous\r\nto give you a specimen. We now keep her chiefly at figures, which she\r\nfinds very difficult, particularly to proportion them, and place them\r\nstraight under each other.\r\n\r\nI will conclude my scrawl in the hope that Frederick will be able to\r\nforward it for me. Adieu. Remember to answer all my questions, and to\r\ntake all my prayers in serious consideration. Be attentive to your\r\nhealth, and you will add to the happiness of your\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 31st July, 1791.\r\n\r\nAt length expectation is gratified, and my hopes--even my wishes,\r\nfulfilled. Your letters of the 16th and 23d came both by the last\r\npost. Their ease, their elegance, and, above all, the affection they\r\ncontain, are truly engaging and amiable. Be assured that petitions so\r\nclothed and attended are _irresistible_.\r\n\r\nI anticipate with increasing impatience the hour of leaving this\r\nplace, and am making every possible exertion to advance it. The delay\r\nof two days at Red Hook is indispensable, but will cost me much\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nI finished on Monday last, tolerably to my own satisfaction, and I\r\nbelieve entirely to that of my employers, the business so often\r\nmentioned to you. I received in reward for my labour many thanks,\r\ntwenty half joes, and promises of more of both of these articles.\r\n\r\nThe last post is the only one I have missed since I left Esopus. I was\r\nin court upon a trial which gave me not a moment's intermission till\r\nten o'clock that evening. Though I do not pay you in quality and\r\nmanner (for yours are, without flattery, inimitable), I believe I am\r\nnothing in arrear in number or quantity. The present is indeed a poor\r\nreturn for your two last; but though you miss of the recompense in\r\nthis sheet, you will find it in the heart of your\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 27th October, 1791.\r\n\r\nI have this day received your letter dated Sunday morning. It came,\r\nnot by Mr. Sedgwick, but by the post, and was not put into the\r\npostoffice until Tuesday. It was therefore wicked of you not to add a\r\nline of that date. I am surprised to find that you had not received my\r\nletter from Brunswick. The illness I then wrote you of increased the\r\nnext day, so that I did not arrive in town until Sunday. I am still at\r\nMiss Roberts's, and unsettled, but hope to be to-morrow in tolerable\r\nwinter-quarters. I have had some trouble on that head, as well because\r\nI am difficult to please, as because good accommodations are difficult\r\nto find.\r\n\r\nI receive many attentions and civilities. Many invitations to dine,\r\n&c. All of which I have declined, and have not eaten a meal except at\r\nmy own quarters. You see, therefore, how little amusement you are to\r\nexpect. I called at Mrs. L.'s (the elder), but have not seen either\r\nher, or as yet called to see her daughter. I have no news of Brooks,\r\nand am distressed by his delay, having scarcely decent clothes. I\r\nprudently brought a coat, but nothing to wear with it, and the\r\nexpectation of Brooks has prevented me from getting any thing here.\r\nSend me a waistcoat, white and brown, such as you designed. You know I\r\nam never pleased except with your taste.\r\n\r\nI wrote you the day after my arrival here, but it being past the post\r\nhour, kept it till Tuesday; made a small addition, and gave it to Mat.\r\nto carry to the office. He put it into his coat-pocket (I suppose with\r\nhis pocket-handkerchief, which you know be has occasion to flourish\r\nalong the street). On the day following, with a face of woe, he told\r\nme he had lost the letter, but had concealed it from me in hopes to\r\nhave found it. I hope it may fall into good-natured hands, and so got\r\neventually into the postoffice. It was short and stupid; unusually so,\r\nwhich perhaps vexed me the more for the loss. Be assured you have\r\nnothing to regret.\r\n\r\nThis letter can have nothing to recommend it but good-will and length,\r\nthough the latter, without some other merit, ought to condemn it; and\r\nit would, I am sure, with any but you, who will give the best\r\nconstruction to any thing from your\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 30th October, 1791.\r\n\r\nI am at length settled in winter-quarters. The house stands about\r\ntwenty yards back from the street, and is inhabited by two widows. The\r\nmother about seventy, and the daughter about fifty. The latter,\r\nhowever, has her home in the country, and comes to town occasionally.\r\nThe old lady is deaf, and upon my first coming to take possession of\r\nmy lodgings, she with great civility requested that I would never\r\nattempt to speak to her, for fear of injuring my lungs without being\r\nable to make her hear. I shall faithfully obey this injunction. The\r\nhouse is remarkably quiet, orderly, and is well furnished. They have\r\nnever before taken a person to board, and will take no other.\r\n\r\nThe honour which I have always done to your taste, and which indeed it\r\nmerits, ought to have assured you that your advice requires no\r\napology. I shall adopt your ideas about the wheels. If at the same\r\ntime you had caused the commission to be executed, you would have\r\nadded civility to good intentions.\r\n\r\nTheodosia must not attempt music in the way she was taught last\r\nspring. For the present, let it be wholly omitted. Neither would I\r\nhave her renew her dancing till the family are arranged. She can\r\nproceed in her French, and get some teacher to attend her in the house\r\nfor writing and arithmetic. She has made no progress in the latter,\r\nand is even ignorant of the rudiments. She was hurried through\r\ndifferent rules without having been able to do a single sum with\r\naccuracy. I would wish her to be also taught geography if a proper\r\nmaster can be found; but suspend this till the arrival of the major.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable I that you should find yourself so soon discouraged\r\nfrom writing, because you had written one letter before you had\r\nreceived one. I had written you two before the receipt of your first.\r\nBut I shall in future expect two or three for one, as the labour of\r\nbusiness will prevent my writing frequently.\r\n\r\nRemember the note to be put in the bank on Wednesday. If Bartow should\r\nnot arrive, send Strong for Willet. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 14th November, 1791.\r\n\r\nI recollect nothing of the letter I wrote to you, and which is\r\nreferred to in yours of the 9th. You have no forgiveness to ask or to\r\nreceive of me. If it was necessary, you had it even at the moment I\r\nread your letter. You mistake the nature of my emotions. They had\r\nnothing of asperity; but it is useless to explain them. I did it\r\npartially in a letter I wrote soon after that which I sent you in\r\nanswer to yours. It was not such a letter as I ought to have written,\r\nor you would have wished to receive; I therefore retained it. In what\r\nway, or to what degree, I am affected by your letter of the 9th, will\r\nnot be told until we meet. Be assured, however, that I look forward to\r\nthat time with impatience and anticipate it with pleasure. It rests\r\nwholly with you, and your conduct on this occasion will be a better\r\nindex to your heart than any thing you can write.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a newspaper of this evening, containing a report by Mr.\r\nJefferson about vacant lands. When you have perused it, send it to\r\nMelancton Smith. Take care, however, to get it back and preserve it,\r\nas it is one of Freneau's. I send you also three of Freneau's papers,\r\nwhich, with that sent this morning, are all he has published. I wish\r\nthem to be preserved. If you find them amusing, you may command them\r\nregularly. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 14th November, 1791.\r\n\r\nI am to-day in much better heart than at any time since I left\r\nNew-York. John Watts took me yesterday a long walk, and, though\r\nfatigued, I was not exhausted. He takes every occasion to show me\r\nfriendship and attention. I see no reason for your delaying to make a\r\nvisit here. The roads are good and the season fine. If you do not\r\nchoose to come directly to my lodgings, which are commodious and\r\nretired, I will meet you either at Dr. Edwards's, two miles from the\r\nRed Lion, or at the Red Lion, which is twelve miles from this city.\r\nYour first stage will be to Brunswick, your second Trenton, and your\r\nthird here.\r\n\r\nI expressed myself ill if I led you to believe that I wished any\r\nevidence or criterion of Theodosia's understanding. I desire only to\r\npromote its growth by its application and exercise. Her present\r\nemployments have no such tendency, unless arithmetic engages a part of\r\nher attention. Than this, nothing can be more useful, or better\r\nadvance the object I have in view. Other studies, promising similar\r\nadvantages, must, perhaps, for the reasons you mention, be for the\r\npresent postponed.\r\n\r\nI hope this weather will relieve you from the most depressing of all\r\ndiseases, the influenza. Exercise will not cure, but will prevent the\r\nreturn of it. I prescribe, however, what I do not practice. You have\r\noften wished for opportunities to read; you now have, and, I hope,\r\nimprove them. I should be glad to know how your attention is directed.\r\nOf the success I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nTo the subject of politics, which composes a part of your letter, I\r\ncan at present make no reply. The _mode_ of communication would not\r\npermit, did no other reasons oppose it.\r\n\r\nI have no voice, but could undoubtedly have some influence in the\r\nappointment you speak of. For the man, you know I have always\r\nentertained much esteem; but it is here said that he drinks. The\r\neffect of the belief, even of the suspicion of this, could not be\r\ncontroverted by any exertion or influence of his friends. I had not,\r\nbefore the receipt of your letter, heard of his wishes on the subject\r\nyou mention. The slander, if slander it be, I had heard often and with\r\npain.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS THEODOSIA BURR. [2]\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 1st December, 1791.\r\n\r\nEnclosed in Bartow's last letter came one which, from the handwriting,\r\nI supposed to be from that great fat fellow, Colonel Troup. Judge of\r\nmy pleasure and surprise when I opened and found it was from my dear\r\nlittle girl. You improve much in your writing. Let your next be in\r\nsmall hand.\r\n\r\nWhy do you neither acknowledge nor answer my last letter? That is not\r\nkind--it is scarcely civil. I beg you will not take a fortnight to\r\nanswer this, as you did the other, and did not answer it at last; for\r\nI love to hear from you, and still more to receive your letters. Read\r\nmy last letter again, and answer it particularly.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 4th December, 1791.\r\n\r\nI fear I have for the present deprived you of the pleasure of reading\r\nGibbon. If you cannot procure the loan of a London edition, I will\r\nsend you that which I have here. In truth, I bought it for you, which\r\nis almost confessing a robbery. Edward Livingston and Richard Harrison\r\nhave each a good set, and either would cheerfully oblige you.\r\n\r\nTo render any reading really amusing or in any degree instructive, you\r\nshould never pass a word you do not understand, or the name of a\r\nperson or place of which you have not some knowledge. You will say\r\nthat attention to such matters is too great an interruption. If so, do\r\nbut note them down on paper, and devote an hour particularly to them\r\nwhen you have finished a chapter or come to a proper pause. After an\r\nexperiment of this mode, you will never abandon it. Lempriere's\r\nDictionary is that of which I spoke to you. Purchase also Macbeau's;\r\nthis last is appropriated to ancient theocracy, fiction, and\r\ngeography; both of them will be useful in reading Gibbon, and still\r\nmore so in reading ancient authors, or of any period of ancient\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIf you have never read Plutarch's Lives (or even if you have), you\r\nwill read them with much pleasure. They are in the City Library, and\r\nprobably in many private ones. Beloe's Herodotus will amuse you.\r\nBartow has it. You had better read the text without the notes; they\r\nare diffuse, and tend to distract the attention. Now and then they\r\ncontain some useful explanation. After you have read the author, you\r\nwill, I think, with more pleasure read the notes and remarks in course\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\nYou expressed a curiosity to peruse Paley's Philosophy of Natural\r\nHistory. Judge Hobart has it. If you read it, be sure to make yourself\r\nmistress of all the terms. But, if you continue your Gibbon, it will\r\nfind you in employment for some days. When you are weary of soaring\r\nwith him, and wish to descend into common life, read the Comedies of\r\nPlautus. There is a tolerable translation in the City Library. Such\r\nbooks give the most lively and amusing, perhaps much the most just\r\npicture, of the manners and degree of refinement of the age in which\r\nthey were written. I have agreed with Popham for his share in the City\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nThe reading of one book will invite you to another. I cannot, I fear,\r\nat this distance, advise you successfully; much less can I hope to\r\nassist you in your reading. You bid me be silent as to my\r\nexpectations; for the present I obey. Your complaint of your memory,\r\neven if founded in fact, contains nothing discouraging or alarming. I\r\nwould not wish you to possess that kind of memory which retains with\r\naccuracy and certainty all names and dates. I never knew it to\r\naccompany much invention or fancy. It is almost the exclusive blessing\r\nof dullness. The mind which perceives clearly adopts and appropriates\r\nan idea, and is thus enlarged and invigorated. It is of little moment\r\nwhether the book, the time, or the occasion be recollected.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to dilate on these topics, and upon the effects, of\r\nreading and study on the mind; but this would require an essay, and I\r\nhave not time to write a letter. I am also much prompted to convince\r\nyou, by undeniable proof, that the ground of your complaint does not\r\nexist except in your own apprehensions, but this I reserve for an\r\ninterview. When I am informed of your progress, and of the direction\r\nof your taste, I may have something further to recommend.\r\n\r\nThere is no probability of an adjournment of Congress during the\r\nholydays, or for any longer time than one day. The possibility of my\r\nbeing able to leave the business of Congress, and make a visit to\r\nNew-York, diminishes daily. I wish much to see you, and, if you are\r\nequally sincere, we can accomplish it by meeting at Trenton. I can be\r\nthere on Friday night, but with much greater convenience on Saturday\r\nnoon or forenoon, and stay till Monday morning at least. Congress\r\nadjourns every week from three o'clock on Friday until eleven o'clock\r\non Monday following. If, therefore, you write me that you will be at\r\nTrenton at the times above mentioned, you may rely on seeing me there:\r\nI mean at Mrs. Hooper's. This, though very practicable at present,\r\nwill not long be so, by reason of the roads, which at present are\r\ngood. If you make this trip, your footman must be on horseback; the\r\nburden will be otherwise too great, and I must have timely notice by\r\nletter. Mr. and Mrs. Paterson have invited you to make their house\r\nyour home at Brunswick.\r\n\r\nMat. laughs at your compliments, as you know he does at every thing. I\r\nexpect Theodosia's messages to be written by herself. I inquire about\r\nyour health, but you do not answer me.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 13th, 1791.\r\n\r\nI regret the disappointment of the Trenton visit, but still more the\r\noccasion of it. Are you afflicted with any of your old, or with what\r\nnew complaint?\r\n\r\nTell Bartow that I have this evening received his letter by Vining,\r\nwho arrived in town last Monday. Beg him never again to write by a\r\nprivate hand about business when there is a post. After the lapse of\r\nfive or six days without an answer, he should have sent a duplicate.\r\nYou have herewith the note for 4500 dollars.\r\n\r\nI was charmed with your reflections on the books of two of our eminent\r\ncharacters. You have, in a few words, given a lively portrait of the\r\nmen and their works. I could not repress the vanity of showing it to a\r\nfriend of _one_ of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy news of the disasters of our western army has engrossed\r\nmy thoughts for some days past. No public event since the war has\r\ngiven me equal anxiety. Official accounts were received from General\r\nSinclair on Sunday. The reports which preceded, and which have\r\ndoubtless reached you before this time, had not exaggerated the loss\r\nor the disgrace. No authentic estimate of the number of the killed has\r\nyet been received; I fear it will not be less than eight or nine\r\nhundred. The retreat was marked with precipitation and terror. The men\r\ndisencumbered themselves even of their arms and accoutrements. It is\r\nsome small consolation to have learned that the troops which fled to\r\nFort Jefferson have received a supply of provisions, and are secure\r\nfrom any attack of the savages.\r\n\r\nI approve, and hope at some time to execute, your plan of literary\r\nrepose. Tell Bartow to send a deed for me to execute to Carpenter,\r\npursuant to our contract. Pray attend to this; you will see that it\r\nmay be a little interesting to me.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 15th December, 1791\r\n\r\nThe post which arrived this afternoon (Thursday) brought the mail\r\nwhich left New-York on Tuesday, and with it your sprightly and\r\nengaging letter of the 12th. I thank you for your attention to my\r\nfriend, and still more for the pleasure you express at his visit. Your\r\n\"nonsense\" about Voltaire contains more good sense than all the\r\nstrictures I have seen upon his works put together.\r\n\r\nNext to your own ideas, those you gave me from Mr. J. were most\r\nacceptable. I wish you would continue to give me any fugitive ideas or\r\nremarks which may occur to you in the course of your reading; and what\r\nyou call your rattling way is that of all others which pleases me the\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nIn short, let the way be your own, and it cannot fail to be\r\nacceptable, to please, and to amuse.\r\n\r\nI enclose this evening's paper. It contains _Strictures on Publicola_,\r\nwhich you, perhaps, may find worth reading.\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive perusal of the French Constitution, and a careful\r\nexamination of their proceedings, I am a warm admirer of the essential\r\nparts of the plan of government which they have instituted, and of the\r\ntalents and disinterestedness of the members of the National Assembly.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 18th December, 1791.\r\n\r\nMr. Learned arrived yesterday with your letter of the 15th. He\r\nappeared pleased with your attentions, which you know gratified me.\r\n\r\nI cannot recollect what hint I gave to Major P. which could have\r\nintimated an expectation of seeing you in New-York during the _current\r\nyear_; unless, indeed, some of those wishes which I too often cherish\r\nshould have escaped me. We shall have no intermission of business\r\nduring the holy-days. If I should find it at any time practicable to\r\nabsent myself for a few days, it will most probably be about the\r\nmiddle of next month. You have indeed, in your last letter, placed\r\nyourself before me in the most amiable light; and, without soliciting,\r\nhave much more strongly enticed me to a visit. But for the present I\r\nmust resist. Will it not be possible for you to meet me at Trenton,\r\nthat we may travel together to New-York? If you assent to this, I will\r\nname a day. Yet do not expose your health. On this subject you leave\r\nme still to apprehension and conjecture.\r\n\r\nYour account of Madame Genlis surprises me, and is a new evidence of\r\nthe necessity of reading books before we put them into the hands of\r\nchildren. Reputation is indeed a precarious test. I can think at\r\npresent of nothing better than what you have chosen.\r\n\r\nI am much in want of my maps of the different parts of North America.\r\nIt will, I believe, be best to send them all, carefully put up in a\r\nbox which must be made for the purpose. You may omit the map of\r\nNew-Jersey. The packing will require much care, as many are in sheets.\r\nAsk Major P. for the survey he gave me of the St. Lawrence, of\r\ndifferent parts of Canada, and of other provinces, and send them also\r\nforward. They may be sent by the Amboy stage, taking a receipt, which\r\ntransmit to me.\r\n\r\nYou would excuse the slovenliness, and admire the length of this\r\nscrawl, if you could look into my study, and see the file of\r\nunanswered, and even _un_perused letters; bundles of papers on public\r\nand on private business; all soliciting that preference of attention\r\nwhich Theodosia knows how to command from her\r\n\r\nAARON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 27th December, 1791.\r\n\r\nWhat can have exhausted or disturbed you so much? You might surely\r\nhave given some hint of the cause. It is an additional reason for\r\nwishing you here. If I had, before I left New-York, sufficiently\r\nreflected on the subject, I would never have consented to this absurd\r\nand irrational mode of life. If you will come with Mr. Monroe, I will\r\nsee you to New-York again; and if you have a particular aversion to\r\nthe city of Philadelphia, you shall stay a day or two at Dr.\r\nEdwards's, ten miles from town, where I can spend the greater part of\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps admire that I cannot leave Congress as well as\r\nothers. This, if a problem, can only be solved at a personal\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nYou perceive that I have received your letter of the 18th. It was\r\ntruly acceptable, and needed no apology. I do not always expect\r\nletters of wit or science; and I beg you will write wholly without\r\nrestraint, both as to quantity and manner. If you write little, I\r\nshall be glad to receive it; and if you write more, I shall be still\r\nmore glad; but when you find it a troublesome or laborious occupation,\r\nwhich I have the vanity to hope will never happen, omit it. I take,\r\nand shall continue to use, this freedom on my part; but I am for ever\r\nobliged to put some restraint on myself, for I often sacrifice the\r\ncalls of business to the pleasure of writing to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n27th December, at night.\r\n\r\nThis evening I am suffering under a severe paroxysm of the headache.\r\nYour letters, received to-night, have tended to beguile the time, and\r\nwere at least a temporary relief. I am now sitting with my feet in\r\nwarm water, my head wrapped in vinegar, and drinking chamomile tea,\r\nand all hitherto to little purpose. I have no doubt, however, but I\r\nshall be well to-morrow. As I shall not probably sleep till morning,\r\nand shall not rise in season to acknowledge your kind letters, I have\r\nattempted this line. I am charmed with your account of Theodosia. Kiss\r\nher a hundred times for me.\r\n\r\nThe reports of my style of life are, I should have thought, too\r\nimprobable to be related, and much too absurd to gain belief, or even\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI have been these three weeks procuring two trifles to send you; but\r\nam at length out of all patience with the stupidity and\r\nprocrastination of those employed; especially as the principal article\r\nis a piece of furniture, a personal convenience, which, when done,\r\nwill not cost five dollars. The other is something between a map and a\r\npicture. Though they will not arrive at the season I wished, they will\r\nat any season be tokens of the affection of\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 2d January, 1792.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Theodosia,\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull is good enough to engage to deliver this. You have long\r\nknown and admired the brilliancy of his genius and wit; I wish you\r\nalso to know the amiable qualities of his heart.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 19th February, 1792.\r\n\r\nYesterday I received your truly affectionate letters; one dated\r\nThursday evening, the other without date.\r\n\r\nYou may expect a host of such falsehoods as that about the Indian war.\r\nI have not been offered any command. When the part I take in the bill\r\non that subject shall be fully known, I am sure it will give entire\r\nsatisfaction to my friends.\r\n\r\nIt will not do for me at present to leave this place. I shall\r\ntherefore expect you here; and if you cannot spare the time to come\r\nhere, I will meet you either at Princeton or Trenton (preferring the\r\nlatter) any evening you shall name. Saturdays and Sundays, you know,\r\nare our holydays. I can with ease be at Trenton at breakfast on\r\nSaturday morning, or even on Friday evening, if thought more eligible.\r\nBut I expect this letter will pass you on your way here. My rooms at\r\nNo. 130 South Second-street are ready to receive you and Mrs. A., if\r\nshe chooses to be of the party. But the tenour of your last induces me\r\nto think that you intend a very short visit, or rather, that you will\r\ncome express. Arrange it as you please, provided I see you somewhere\r\nand soon.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Witbeck of a later date than that by Strong, and\r\nof much more satisfactory tenour. I believe he will not disappoint the\r\nexpectations of my friends. He requests that some persons in New-York\r\nmay write to him and others in and about Albany, giving an account of\r\nthe expectations in Ulster, Dutchess, and the Southern District, and\r\nnaming persons who may be corresponded with.\r\n\r\nMy lodgings are on the right hand as you come. Drive directly up a\r\nwhite gate between two lamps, and take possession. If I should be out,\r\nthe servant will know where, and will find me in a few minutes. Do not\r\ntravel with any election partisan (unless an opponent).\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS THEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 5th August, 1792.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR THEO.,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, which is very short, and says not one\r\nword of your mamma's health. You talk of going to Westchester, but do\r\nnot say when or how.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Witbeck and their daughter talk very much about you, and\r\nwould be very glad to see you.\r\n\r\nSee what a letter I have got from little Burr, [3] and all his own\r\nwork too. Before I left home I wrote him a letter requesting him to\r\ntell me what I should bring him; and in answer, he begs me to bring\r\nmamma and you. A pretty present, indeed, that would be!\r\n\r\nYour father,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DR. BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 24th September, 1792.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThis letter will be handed to you by Mr. Beckley. He possesses a fund\r\nof information about men and things. The republican ferment continues\r\nto work in our state; and the time, I think, is approaching very fast\r\nwhen we shall universally reprobate the maxim of sacrificing public\r\njustice and national gratitude to the interested ideas of\r\nstock-jobbers and brokers, whether in or out of the legislature of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nYour friends everywhere look to you to take an active part in removing\r\nthe monarchical rubbish of our government. It is time to speak out, or\r\nwe are undone. The association in Boston augurs well. Do feed it by a\r\nletter to Mr. Samuel Adams. My letter will serve to introduce you to\r\nhim, if enclosed in one from yourself. Mrs. Rush joins me in best\r\ncompliments to Mrs. Burr, with\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS THEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\nWestchester, 8th October, 1792.\r\n\r\n--I rose up suddenly from the sofa, and rubbing my head--\"What book\r\nshall I buy for her?\" said I to myself. \"She reads so much and so\r\nrapidly that it is not easy to find proper and amusing French books\r\nfor her; and yet I am so flattered with her progress in that language,\r\nthat I am resolved that she shall, at all events, be gratified.\r\nIndeed, I owe it to her.\" So, after walking once or twice briskly\r\nacross the floor, I took my hat and sallied out, determined not to\r\nreturn till I had purchased something. It was not my first attempt. I\r\nwent into one bookseller's shop after another. I found plenty of fairy\r\ntales and such nonsense, fit for the generality of children of nine or\r\nten years old. \"These,\" said I, \"will never do. Her understanding\r\nbegins to be above such things;\" but I could see nothing that I would\r\noffer with pleasure to _an intelligent, well-informed girl of nine\r\nyears old_. I began to be discouraged. The hour of dining was come.\r\n\"But I will search a little longer.\" I persevered. At last I found it.\r\nI found the very thing I sought. It is contained in two volumes\r\noctavo, handsomely bound, and with prints and registers. It is a work\r\nof fancy, but replete with instruction and amusement. I must present\r\nit with my own hand.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Major Prevost, who was a widower, and whose children were left in\r\nthe care of Mrs. Burr while he made a voyage to England.\r\n\r\n2. In the ninth year of her age.\r\n\r\n3. Nephew of Colonel Burr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in the last chapter between Mr. and Mrs. Burr has\r\nbeen selected and published that the world may judge him as husband\r\nand parent, so far as his letters afford a criterion. As literary\r\nproductions they cannot fail to interest and amuse.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of March, 1790, the legislature passed an act\r\nappointing Gerard Bancker, treasurer, Peter Curtenius, auditor, and\r\nAaron Burr, attorney-general, a board of commissioners to report on\r\nthe subject of the various claims against the state for services\r\nrendered, or injuries sustained, during the war of the revolution. The\r\ntask was one of great delicacy, and surrounded with difficulties. On\r\nColonel Burr devolved the duty of making that report. It was performed\r\nin a masterly manner. When presented to the house, notwithstanding its\r\nmagnitude, involving claims of every description to an immense amount,\r\nit met with no opposition from any quarter. On the 5th of April, 1792,\r\nthe report was ordered to be entered at length on the journals of the\r\nassembly, and formed the basis of all future settlements with public\r\ncreditors on account of the war. In it the various claimants are\r\nclassified; legal and equitable principles are established, and\r\napplied to each particular class. The report occupies eighteen folio\r\npages of the journals of the assembly. An extract from it is made, as\r\njustly meriting a place in this work.\r\n\r\nThe said report is in the words and figures following:----\"The\r\ntreasurer, the auditor, and the attorney-general, pursuant to the act\r\nentitled _An act to receive and state accounts against this state_,\r\ndid forthwith, after the passing of the said act, give such notice of\r\ntheir appointment and duties, and of the times and places for the\r\nexecution thereof, and of the period by the said act limited for\r\nreceiving and auditing claims, as is directed by the said act. And do\r\nherewith transmit to the legislature their report upon the accounts\r\nand claims against the state, which have been thereupon exhibited.\r\n\r\n\"The anxiety of the commissioners to render the execution of this\r\ntrust useful and acceptable has occasioned a delay of some weeks; if\r\ntheir success in this attempt has been in any degree proportioned to\r\ntheir attention to the subject, it will furnish their excuse; indeed,\r\nwhen the legislature shall have seen the number, the variety, and\r\nintricacy of the matters which have been submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the commissioners, it is hoped that a further apology\r\nwill be thought unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners have endeavoured to reduce these various demands\r\ninto classes, in such manner as to present to the legislature, in one\r\nview, all which have appeared to depend on similar principles.\r\nNotwithstanding their utmost attention to this object, they have found\r\nit necessary to report on a considerable number of single cases. As\r\nthe authority under which they have acted required of them a state of\r\nfacts, together with their opinion thereupon, whenever there was a\r\nwant of uniformity either in the facts submitted or in the principles\r\nto be applied in the determination, they have thought that strict\r\njustice could not be done to the merit of the claim without a separate\r\ndiscussion, though this has tended to lengthen the report beyond what\r\ncould have been wished, and to a degree which perhaps may in some\r\ninstances be thought prolix, yet the commissioners supposed it of\r\nmoment that their investigation should be not only satisfactory to\r\nthemselves, but that it should be apparent to the citizens upon whose\r\nclaims they have pronounced, that each hath received a distinct\r\nattention, and that demands substantially different from each other\r\nhave not been inconsiderately blended. If the perusal of the\r\nproceedings now submitted shall give an impression of this kind, it\r\nwill, in the opinion of the commissioners, tend to produce a more\r\ncheerful acquiescence in the determination of the legislature, when\r\nthat determination shall reject the demand, and prevent a revival of\r\nclaims which shall now be extinguished. The commissioners have thought\r\nthat these were desirable objects, and have therefore been cautious of\r\ngeneralizing, so as to destroy real distinctions, or suppress a fact\r\neven of the lightest importance.\r\n\r\n\"In order to preserve uniformity in their opinions, the commissioners\r\nhave adopted certain principles, from which the hardship of any\r\nparticular case hath not induced them to depart. The most general and\r\nimportant of these are,\r\n\r\n\"_First_. Where any species of claims is barred by an act of the\r\nlegislature, they have considered the act as a bar to their\r\ninvestigation, farther than to ascertain it to be unquestionably\r\nwithin the meaning of the law. This principle will be found to extend\r\nto all claims for pay and rations alleged to be due for militia\r\nservice; to most of the demands against forfeited estates; to all\r\nclaims for property sequestered, when the sequestration was warranted\r\nby the resolutions of the convention and the authority of the\r\ncommissioners; to all claims of payment of state agents' notes, and to\r\nsome other particular cases, which will appear in the report. In\r\nsupport of this principle the commissioners have considered, that to\r\nsanction by their opinion the admission of claims against the spirit\r\nand letter of the statute would be an impeachment of the wisdom of\r\nthose laws; would be arrogating an authority not exercised by, or\r\npermitted to, any court of law or equity, and would open a door to the\r\nimportunate and perhaps least deserving class of citizens, while\r\nothers, having similar demands, had withdrawn them from a spirit of\r\nsubmission to the laws, by which these demands were precluded. The\r\ncommissioners have been confirmed in the propriety of their ideas by a\r\nreflection that, if it shall for any reasons seem expedient to the\r\nlegislature to repeal or suspend the limitation of these or any of\r\nthose statutes, the avenues to redress will at once be open through\r\nthe ordinary officers of the state, without farther legislative\r\ninterposition; and that the opportunities of recompense would then be\r\nnotorious and equal; but that the redress, if any should be obtained\r\nthrough the medium of the commissioners, would be partial in its\r\noperation, and to the exclusion of those who with equal merits had\r\nacquiesced in the known laws.\r\n\r\n\"_Second._ In the cases of claims for services done and supplies\r\nfurnished during the war, when the demand, though originating under\r\nthe authority of this state, is properly against the United States,\r\nthe opinion of the commissioners is against the allowance of any\r\nrecompense, because those claims should more properly be preferred to\r\nCongress; and for that this state can have no credit with the United\r\nStates for payment or assumptions after the 1st day of October, 1788.\r\n\r\n\"And that, therefore, the claimants having neglected to exhibit their\r\ndemands within the period during which this state could without loss\r\nhave assumed them, cannot complain if they are now referred to the\r\nproper tribunal. Payments by the state were in such cases, at all\r\ntimes, of favour, and not of right.\r\n\r\n\"_Third._ All claims for the subsistence and services of the levies\r\nand militia, or other troops, composing a part of the continental\r\narmy, or destined to join the army, and moving to such places of\r\ndestination, or under the command or orders of a continental officer,\r\nand all claims for supplies and services beforehand for such troops,\r\nare considered as proper against the United States only, and are\r\nclassed accordingly; the commissioners have been led to a more strict\r\nattention to this distinction by the reasons just before mentioned,\r\nand are warranted by the practice of the continental commissioners for\r\nsettling accounts, in declaring that such accounts and demands were\r\nproper against the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Principles of more limited operation, and other remarks, will appear\r\nin those parts of the report to which they apply.\r\n\r\n\"Explanatory of particular parts, and of the general form of the\r\nreport, it may be proper to observe,\r\n\r\n\"That where the claim or account appears, upon the face of it, to be\r\nevidently against the United States only, or for other reasons\r\npalpably inadmissible, the commissioners have thought it would have\r\nbeen superfluous to state the proof, and have therefore, in those\r\ncases only, given such abstracts of the claim or account as suffice to\r\nrender the exception apparent.\r\n\r\n\"In giving their opinion, the commissioners have not detailed all the\r\nreasons which led to it, but have given a summary of such as appeared\r\nto them most conclusive; and, as well in this as in stating the facts,\r\nhave aimed at as much brevity as appeared to them to consist with\r\nperspicuity. If they shall be found in any instances obscure, a\r\nreference to the claim and proofs will probably elucidate them. When\r\nthe claim is provided for by existing laws, the opinion of the\r\ncommissioners refers the claimant to the mode pointed out by such law.\r\n\r\n\"Demands of different natures by the same person are placed under the\r\nhead which comprises the greater demand. The claim and vouchers being\r\nin such cases usually contained in the same paper or annexed together,\r\nit was necessary so to place them in the report that there might be no\r\nconfusion in the references.\r\n\r\n\"To produce facility in the review of these proceedings, the documents\r\nreferred to are all herewith delivered, and are in bundles, marked\r\nagreeably to the heads under which they are classed.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims for Militia Pay._\r\n\r\n[In the report a number of cases are here inserted.]\r\n\r\n\"By an act passed the 27th of April, 1784, entitled _An act for the\r\nsettlement of the pay of the levies and militia for their services in\r\nthe late war, and for other purposes therein mentioned_, the mode in\r\nwhich the rolls and abstracts for pay and subsistence are to be made\r\nout and settled is particularly pointed out, and competent powers and\r\ndirections for the liquidation of those accounts are thereby given to\r\nthe treasurer and auditor.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the 14th section of an act passed the 21st of April, 1787,\r\nentitled _An act for the relief of persons who paid money into the\r\ntreasury, &c_., the aforesaid act of the 27th of April, 1784, is\r\nrepealed. The commissioners consider this repeal as an exclusion of\r\nall further claims for pay and subsistence of the militia and levies.\r\nThey are constrained to adopt this opinion, not only from the obvious\r\nintention of the act, but because, by the absolute repeal of the act\r\nof the 27th of April, 1784, there remains no prescribed mode of\r\nauthenticating these demands; that any rules which the discretion of\r\nthe commissioners should lead them to adopt would have been unknown to\r\nthe claimants, who could therefore have had no opportunity of adapting\r\ntheir demands to such rules; and because, if the legislature shall be\r\ndisposed to direct compensations for such services, it will, in the\r\nopinion of the commissioners, be most properly effected by a revival\r\nof the said act of the 27th of April, 1784, with such further\r\nprovisions and checks as may be thought necessary; or by some other\r\ngeneral statute, to be passed for those purposes, and which may give\r\nequal opportunities to the claimants, and place the liquidation and\r\nsettlement of such demands in the hands of the ordinary officers of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims for services, supplies, and losses, which, if admissible, can\r\nbe made against the United States only._\r\n\r\n[In the report details follow, and the commissioners remark]--\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing claims and accounts the commissioners conceive to be\r\nproper against the United States only. This is, in their opinion,\r\nsufficiently evident in most of the cases from a bare statement of the\r\ndemands. Some few appear to require a more special report. The\r\nresolutions of Congress of the 7th of May, 1787, and 24th of June,\r\n1788, relative to the settlement of accounts between the United States\r\nand individual states, will show the extent of the powers of the\r\nContinental Commissioners, and will serve to explain the opinions in\r\nsuch of the preceding cases as may appear to require farther\r\nillustration.\"\r\n\r\n \"_Claims for payment of State Agents' Certificates_.\r\n\r\n\"By the 25th section of the act passed the 5th of May, 1786, entitled\r\n_An act for the payment of certain sums of money, and for other\r\npurposes therein mentioned_, all persons holding or possessing\r\ncertificates of Udny Hay or any of his assistants, or of Jacob Cuyler,\r\nMorgan Lewis, or Andrew Bostwick, were required to present them, in\r\nthe manner therein prescribed, to the treasurer, before the 1st of\r\nSeptember, 1786; and those who failed therein are thereby declared _to\r\nbe barred and for ever precluded_ from any compensation, of which the\r\ntreasurer was directed to give public notice by advertisement, which\r\nwas accordingly done.\r\n\r\n\"By another act, passed the 31st of March, 1787, the time for\r\npresenting the certificates of Udny Hay and his assistants was\r\nextended until the first of May then next, which time has not been\r\nfurther extended by any law of this state: so that all certificates of\r\nthose denominations which were not presented within the times and in\r\nthe manner specified in those laws, are expressly barred and for ever\r\nprecluded from compensation.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners have therefore, for the reasons contained in the\r\nobservations prefixed to this report, conceived that a reference to\r\nthe aforesaid acts was the most proper discharge of their duty with\r\nrespect to all claims of compensation for such certificates.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims for grain impressed for the use of the army by virtue of\r\nwarrants issued by his excellency the governor, pursuant to an act\r\npassed 23d June, 1780_.\r\n\r\n\"The law authorizing these impresses declares the articles impressed\r\nto be for the _use and service of the army_, and that the owner shall\r\nbe entitled to receive from the public officer authorized to pay the\r\nsame the current price for the articles impressed, but does not say by\r\nwhom that public officer is to be appointed. The commissioners have,\r\nhowever, no doubt but these were proper claims against the United\r\nStates, and would have been allowed by the Continental Commissioner if\r\nexhibited in proper season; therefore, and for the reasons contained\r\nin the second preliminary observation, the commissioners are of the\r\nopinion that these claimants cannot of right demand payment of this\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\"The claims of Van Rensselaer and Dumond, the commissioners are of\r\nopinion are reasonable; that, having been employed under the governor,\r\nthe claimants could have no demand against the United States, and that\r\nthe charges are proper against this state.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims for services in assisting H.I. Van Rensselaer and Egbert\r\nDumond in making the said impresses_.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners consider the reasons just before stated in favour\r\nof the claims of Van Rensselaer and Dumond to apply to the eleven\r\npreceding, and that they are therefore proper charges against this\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims for payment of debts due from persons whose property hath\r\nbeen forfeited or sequestered_.\r\n\r\n\"The several foregoing demands against forfeited estates arose after\r\nthe 9th day of July, 1776, and are expressly precluded by the 42d\r\nsection of an act passed the 12th of May, 1784, entitled _An act for\r\nthe speedy sale of the confiscated and forfeited estates within this\r\nstate, and for other purposes therein mentioned_.\r\n\r\n\"The next twenty-five claims are for satisfaction of debts out of the\r\nproceeds of property sequestered. The estates of the several debtors\r\nhave become forfeited, but in some instances no property hath come to\r\nthe hands of the commissioners of forfeitures; and in others, the\r\nproperty which has come to their hands hath been insufficient for the\r\ndischarge of debts which have been certified.\r\n\r\n\"The succeeding twenty-six claims are to have debts satisfied out of\r\nthe proceeds of property sequestered, though there had been no\r\nconviction of adherence or other forfeiture of the estate of the\r\ndebtors.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners are of opinion that a law should be passed\r\nauthorizing the treasurer to pay demands against forfeited estates, in\r\nall cases where there still remains in his hands a surplus from the\r\nproceeds of such estates, notwithstanding the limitation contained in\r\nthe act of 12th May, 1784. But the commissioners would recommend that\r\nsome mode different from that prescribed in the said act be directed\r\nfor the ascertaining the amount of those demands. The several\r\nclaimants and such others as have neglected to avail themselves of the\r\nbenefit of the said act, may, in the opinion of the commissioners, be\r\nwith propriety holden to strict legal proof of their respective\r\ndemands, in due course of law, in some court of record, where the\r\ninterest of the state may be defended by some officer to be for that\r\npurpose appointed.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners are further of opinion, that where there has been a\r\nsequestration of any part of the property of a person _whose estate\r\nhath become forfeited_, the avails of the property so sequestered, as\r\nfar as the same _can be distinguished_, should be subject to the\r\npayment of his debts, in like manner as may be provided with respect\r\nto other demands against forfeited estates; but it would not, in the\r\nopinion of the commissioners, be at this time advisable to assume the\r\npayment of the debts of persons whose property hath been sequestered,\r\nand where there hath been no other forfeiture or confiscation.\r\n\r\n\"_Claims relative to sequestration, and property taken by orders of\r\nthe Convention_.\r\n\r\n\"These persons were voluntarily within the British lines, and their\r\nproperty was therefore liable to sequestration under the acts of the\r\nConvention. They produce a certificate of their attachment to the\r\nAmerican cause, signed by some respectable characters. But being\r\nwithin the resolutions of the Convention, the commissioners cannot\r\nadvise a recompense.\r\n\r\n  \"GERARD BANCKER, _Treasurer_.\r\n  \"PETER T. CURTENIUS, _State Auditor_.\r\n  \"AARON BURR, _Attorney-general_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1791, Colonel Burr was appointed a senator of\r\nthe United States, in the place of General Schuyler, whose term of\r\nservice would expire on the 4th of March following. Until about this\r\nperiod he was but little known as a partisan politician. After the\r\norganization of the federal government under the new constitution, he\r\nappears to have felt a great interest in its operations. In the French\r\nrevolution also, his feelings were embarked; and he was among the\r\nnumber of those who condemned the cold and repulsive neutrality which\r\ncharacterized the administration of that day. That he was now about to\r\nlaunch into the troubled ocean of politics was evident to Mrs. Burr,\r\nand therefore, in a letter to him under date of the 23d of July, 1791,\r\nshe says, \"It is of serious consequence to you to establish your\r\nhealth _before you commence politician_,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1791 Congress convened at Philadelphia, and Colonel\r\nBurr took his seat in the Senate of the United States. It has often\r\nbeen remarked of him, and truly, that no man was ever more cautious or\r\nmore guarded in his correspondence. A disposition, from the earliest\r\nperiod of his life, to write in cipher, has already been noticed. To\r\nthis may be added an unwillingness, on all important questions, to\r\ncommit himself in writing. As soon as he entered the political arena,\r\nthis characteristic was visible even in his letters to Mrs. Burr. On\r\nthe 14th of November, 1791, he writes her--\"To the subject of politics\r\nI can at present make no reply. The _mode of communication would not\r\npermit_, did no other reason oppose.\" And again, December 21st, he\r\nsays--\"You will perhaps admire that I cannot leave Congress as well as\r\nothers. This, if a problem, _can only be solved at a personal\r\ninterview_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the revolutionary war, the State of New-York\r\nheld an extensive tract of wild and unimproved lands. Sundry laws were\r\npassed in the years 1779, 1780, 1784, 1785, and 1786, providing for\r\ntheir sale and settlement. A board was created, entitled \"the\r\nCommissioners of the Land Office.\" It was composed of the governor,\r\nthe secretary of state, the attorney-general, the treasurer, and the\r\nauditor. The powers conferred by the several acts above referred to\r\nhaving been found inadequate to the proposed object, the legislature,\r\non the 22d of March, 1791, gave unlimited powers to the commissioners,\r\nauthorizing them to \"dispose of any of the waste and unappropriated\r\nlands in the state, in such parcels, and on such terms, and in such\r\nmanner as they shall judge most conducive to the interests of the\r\nstate.\" In pursuance of this authority, the commissioners sold during\r\nthe year 1791, by estimate, five millions five hundred and forty-two\r\nthousand one hundred and seventy acres of waste land, for the sum of\r\none million and thirty thousand four hundred and thirty-three dollars;\r\nleaving in the possession of the state, yet to be disposed of, about\r\ntwo millions of acres. Among the sales was one to Alexander Macomb,\r\nfor three millions six hundred and thirty-five thousand two hundred\r\nacres. The magnitude of this sale, and the price at which it was sold,\r\ncreated a great excitement throughout the state, and at the session of\r\nthe legislature which commenced on the 4th of January, 1792, the\r\nsubject was brought before the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe price at which Mr. Macomb made his purchase was eight pence per\r\nacre, payable in five annual instalments, without interest, with\r\npermission to discount for prompt payment at six per cent. per annum,\r\nwhich made the price about equal to seven cents per acre cash. Colonel\r\nBurr, as attorney-general, was a member of the board. On the 9th of\r\nApril, 1792, the report of the commissioners being the order of the\r\nday, the subject was taken up in the house. Mr. Talbot, from\r\nMontgomery county, moved sundry resolutions. They were intended as the\r\nfoundation for an impeachment of a part of the commissioners of the\r\nland office. They assumed to contain a statement of facts, evidencing\r\non the part of the commissioners great indiscretion and want of\r\njudgment, if not corruption, in the sale of the public lands, and they\r\ncharged the commissioners with a willful violation of the law. These\r\nresolutions, however, excepted Colonel Burr from any participation in\r\nthe maleconduct complained of, inasmuch as the minutes of the board\r\nproved that he was not present at the meetings (being absent on\r\nofficial duty as attorney-general) when these contracts, so ruinous,\r\nas they alleged, to the interests of the state, were made: nor did it\r\nappear that he (Colonel Burr) was ever consulted in relation to them.\r\nThese resolutions elicited a heated debate; in the progress of which\r\nall the commissioners, except the attorney-general, were assailed with\r\ngreat bitterness; and charges of corruption by innuendo were\r\nunceremoniously made. At a late hour the house adjourned without\r\ndecision until the next day.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April, 1792, Mr. Melancton Smith moved the following\r\nresolution, with a preamble as a substitute:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this house do highly approve of the conduct of the\r\ncommissioners of the land office in the judicious sales by them, as\r\naforesaid, which have been productive of the before mentioned\r\nbeneficial effects.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was adopted by a vote of ays 35--noes 20.\r\n\r\nOf Melancton Smith it is proper to remark here that he was a plain,\r\nunsophisticated man. A purer patriot never lived. Of the powers of his\r\nmind some opinion may be formed by the following anecdote. Dr.\r\nLedyard, who was afterwards health officer of the port of New-York,\r\nwas a warm federalist. He was at Poughkeepsie while the federal\r\nconstitution was under discussion in the state convention. Smith was\r\nan anti-federal member of that body. Some time after the adoption of\r\nthe constitution, Ledyard stated to a friend of his, that to Colonel\r\nAlexander Hamilton had been assigned, in a special manner, the duty of\r\ndefending that portion of the constitution which related to the\r\njudiciary of the United States. That an outdoor conversation between\r\nColonel Hamilton and Mr. Smith took place in relation to the\r\njudiciary, in the course of which Smith urged some of his objections\r\nto the proposed system. In the evening a federal caucus was held; at\r\nthat caucus Mr. Hamilton referred to the conversation, and requested\r\nthat some gentleman might be designated to aid in the discussion of\r\nthis question. Robert R. Livingston, chancellor of the state, was\r\naccordingly named. Mr. Livingston was at that time a distinguished\r\nleader in the ranks of the federal party. Whoever will take the\r\ntrouble to read the debates in the Convention, in which will be found\r\nthe reply of Smith to Livingston, will perceive in that reply the\r\nefforts of a mighty mind. It was a high but merited compliment to the\r\ntalents of Melancton Smith, that such a man as Colonel Hamilton should\r\nhave wished aid in opposing him.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1791-92, being Colonel Burr's first session in\r\nthe Senate of the United States, he spent much of his leisure time in\r\nthe state department. For several sessions after the organization of\r\nthe federal government, all the business of the Senate was transacted\r\nwith closed doors. At that period the correspondence of existing\r\nministers was kept secret, even from the senators. With every thing\r\nconnected with the foreign affairs of the country, Colonel Burr was\r\nexceedingly anxious to make himself intimately acquainted. He\r\nconsidered it necessary to the faithful and useful performance of his\r\nduty as a senator. He obtained permission from Mr. Jefferson, then\r\nsecretary of state, to have access to the records of the department\r\nbefore the hour for opening the office arrived. He employed one of the\r\nmessengers to make a fire at five o'clock in the morning, and\r\noccasionally an intelligent and confidential clerk to assist him in\r\nsearching for papers. Here he was engaged until near ten o'clock every\r\nday. It was his constant practice to have his breakfast sent to him.\r\nHe continued this employment the greater part of the session, making\r\nnotes on, or extracts from, the records of the department, until he\r\nwas interrupted by a peremptory order from the president (Washington)\r\nprohibiting his farther examination.\r\n\r\nWishing some information that he had not obtained in relation to a\r\nsurrender of the western posts by the British, he addressed a note to\r\nthe secretary of state, asking permission to make that particular\r\nexamination; to which he received the following answer:----\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Jefferson presents his respectful compliments to Colonel Burr,\r\nand is sorry to inform him it has been concluded to be improper to\r\ncommunicate the correspondence of existing ministers. He hopes this\r\nwill, with Colonel Burr, be his sufficient apology.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1792, there was an election for governor of the State of\r\nNew-York. By some it was supposed that Governor Clinton would decline\r\nbeing again considered a candidate. It was known that John Jay would\r\nbe the candidate of the federal party. At that period Colonel Burr had\r\nwarm personal friends in both parties, who were urging his\r\npretensions. Among the most ardent was Judge Yates. In the latter part\r\nof February, 1792, he authorized his friends to state that he declined\r\na nomination. He was placed, however, in an unpleasant dilemma. The\r\nconnexions, and many of the personal friends of Governor Clinton, were\r\njealous of Colonel Burr's talents and growing influence. Between the\r\ngovernor and himself there was very little intercourse. On the other\r\nhand, the kindest feelings towards him were evinced by Chief-justice\r\nJay, who was a most amiable man. It was his wish, therefore, as far as\r\npracticable, consistent with his principles, to remain neuter. He had\r\nnever been an electioneering character, and with the people he wished\r\nto leave the pending question, without the exercise of any influence\r\nhe might be supposed to possess.\r\n\r\nBy the then existing laws of New-York, the ballots that were taken in\r\nthe several counties were, immediately after the election, transmitted\r\nto the office of the secretary of state, and there kept until the\r\nsecond Tuesday in May, when the board of canvassers were, by law, to\r\nconvene and canvass them. The election for governor was warmly\r\ncontested; the federal party supporting Judge Jay, the anti-federal\r\nparty George Clinton. When the canvassers met, difficulties arose as\r\nto the legality of the returns from certain counties, particularly of\r\nOtsego, Tioga, and Clinton. The canvassers differing in opinion on the\r\nquestion whether the ballots should be counted or destroyed, they\r\nagreed to ask the advice of Rufus King and Colonel Burr. These\r\ngentlemen conferred, and, like the canvassers, differed: whereupon Mr.\r\nBurr proposed that they should decline giving advice. To this Mr. King\r\nobjected, and expressed a determination to give his own opinion\r\nseparate. This rendered it necessary for Colonel Burr to adopt a like\r\nprocedure. He thus became a partisan, and a most efficient partisan,\r\nin that controversy.\r\n\r\n_Seven_ of the canvassers determined to reject and destroy the ballots\r\nalleged to have been illegally returned. To this decision _four_\r\nobjected. The ballots were accordingly destroyed, and George Clinton\r\ndeclared to be duly elected governor. The excitement produced was\r\nwithout a parallel in the state. The friends of Judge Jay contended\r\nthat he had been chosen by the people, but was cheated out of his\r\nelection by the corruption of the canvassers. Great asperity and\r\nvirulence were exhibited by both political parties on the occasion.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Colonel Burr was driven to interfere in the\r\ncontroversy, he took upon himself, almost exclusively, the management\r\nof the whole case on the side of the anti-federal party. His\r\naccustomed acumen, vigilance, and zeal, were promptly put in\r\nrequisition. Full scope was allowed for the display of those great\r\nlegal talents for which he was so pre-eminently distinguished. It has\r\nbeen known to only a very few individuals that on Colonel Burr rested\r\nnearly the whole labour; and that nothing was done, even by the\r\ncanvassers, but under his advice and direction. It has therefore been\r\ndeemed proper to insert here some of the official details of the case.\r\nThey are worthy record, as an interesting part of the political\r\nhistory of the State of New-York.\r\n\r\n\"_Statement of the case by the Canvassers, for the advice of Rufus\r\nKing and Aaron Burr_.\r\n\r\n\"OTSEGO.--By the 26th section of the constitution of the State of\r\nNew-York, it is ordained that sheriffs and coroners be annually\r\nappointed, and that no person shall be capable of holding either of\r\nthe said offices for more than four years successively, nor the\r\nsheriff of holding any other office at the same time. By the ninth\r\nsection of the act for regulating elections, it is enacted that one of\r\nthe inspectors shall deliver the ballots and poll-lists, scaled up, to\r\nthe sheriff of the county; and, by the tenth section of the said act,\r\nit is further enacted, that each and every sheriff of the respective\r\ncounties in this state shall, upon receiving the said enclosures,\r\ndirected to be delivered to him as aforesaid, without opening or\r\ninspecting the same, or any or either of them, put the said\r\nenclosures, and every one of them, into one box, which shall be well\r\nclosed and sealed up by him, under his hand and seal, with the name of\r\nhis county written on the box, and be delivered by him into the office\r\nof the secretary of this state, where the same shall be safely kept by\r\nthe secretary, or his deputy. By the eleventh section of the said act,\r\nall questions arising on the canvass and estimate of the votes, or on\r\nany of the proceedings therein, shall be determined by a majority of\r\nthe members of the joint committee attending; and their judgment shall\r\nbe final, and the oath of the canvassers requires them faithfully,\r\nhonestly, and impartially to canvass and estimate the votes contained\r\nin the boxes delivered into the office of the secretary of this state\r\nby the sheriffs of the several counties.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th of February, 1791, Richard R. Smith was appointed sheriff\r\nof the county of Otsego, and his commission gives him the custody of\r\nthat county until the 18th of February, 1792. On the 13th of January,\r\n1792, he writes a letter to the Council of Appointment, informing them\r\nthat, as the year for which he was appointed had nearly elapsed, he\r\nshould decline a reappointment.\r\n\r\n\"On the 30th of March, 1792, the Council of Appointment appointed\r\nBenjamin Gilbert to the office of sheriff of the said county, with a\r\ncommission, in the usual form, to keep the county until the 17th of\r\nFebruary next. His commission was delivered to Stephen Van Rensselaer,\r\nEsq., on the 13th of April last, to be forwarded by him to the said\r\nBenjamin Gilbert. By the affidavit of the said Benjamin Gilbert,\r\nherewith delivered, it appears that he qualified into the office of\r\nsheriff on the 11th day of May, 1792. On the first Tuesday in April,\r\n1792, Richard R. Smith was elected supervisor of the town of Otsego,\r\nin said county, and on the first Tuesday in May took his seat at the\r\nboard of supervisors, and assisted in the appointment of loan officers\r\nfor the county of Otsego. By the affidavit of Richard R. Smith,\r\nherewith delivered, it appears that the ballots taken in the county of\r\nOtsego were delivered to him as sheriff, and by him enclosed in a\r\nsufficient box, on or about the 3d of May, which box he then delivered\r\ninto the hands of Leonard Goes, a person specially deputed by him for\r\nthe purpose of delivering the said box into the hands of the secretary\r\nof this state, which was accordingly done, as appears by information\r\nfrom the secretary.\r\n\r\n\"A small bundle of papers, enclosed and sealed, was delivered to the\r\nsecretary with the box, on which is written, 'The votes of the town of\r\nCherry Valley, in the county of Otsego. Richard R. Smith, Sheriff.'\r\nSeveral affidavits, herewith delivered, state certain facts respecting\r\nthis separate bundle, said to be the votes of Cherry Valley.\r\n\r\n\"On this case arise the following questions:--\r\n\r\n\"1. Was Richard R. Smith the sheriff of the county of Otsego when he\r\nreceived and forwarded the ballots by his special deputy?\r\n\r\n\"2. If he was not sheriff, can the votes sent by him be legally\r\ncanvassed?\r\n\r\n\"3. Can the joint committee canvass the votes when sent to them in two\r\nparcels, the one contained in a box, and the other contained in a\r\npaper, or separate bundle? Or,\r\n\r\n\"4. Ought they to canvass those sealed in the box, and reject the\r\nothers?\r\n\r\n\"TIOGA.--It appears that the sheriff of Tioga delivered the box\r\ncontaining the ballots to B. Hovey, his special deputy, who set out,\r\nwas taken sick on his journey, and delivered the box to H. Thompson,\r\nhis clerk, who delivered it into the secretary's office.\r\n\r\n\"_Question_. Ought the votes of Tioga to be canvassed?\r\n\r\n\"CLINTON.--It appears that the sheriff of Clinton delivered the box\r\ncontaining the ballots to Theodorus Platt, Esq., who had no\r\ndeputation, but who delivered them into the secretary's office, as\r\nappears by his affidavit.\r\n\r\n\"_Question._ Ought the votes of Clinton to be canvassed?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. King's opinion to the Canvassers_.\r\n\r\n\"OTSEGO.--It may be inferred, from the constitution and laws of the\r\nstate, that the office of sheriff is held during the pleasure of the\r\nCouncil of Appointment, subject to the limitation contained in the\r\n26th section of the constitution. The sheriff may therefore hold his\r\noffice for four years, unless within that period a successor shall\r\nhave been appointed, and shall have entered upon the execution of the\r\noffice. The term of four years from the appointment of R. R. Smith not\r\nhaving expired, and B. Gilbert not having entered upon the execution\r\nof the office before the receipt and delivery of the votes by R. R.\r\nSmith to his deputy, I am of opinion that R. R. Smith was then lawful\r\nsheriff of Otsego.\r\n\r\n\"This opinion is strengthened by what is understood to be practice,\r\nnamely, that the office of sheriff is frequently held for more than a\r\nyear under one appointment.\r\n\r\n\"R. R. Smith's giving notice to the Council of Appointment of his\r\ndisinclination to be reappointed, or his acting as supervisor, cannot,\r\nin my opinion, be deemed a resignation or surrender of his office.\r\n\r\n\"Should doubts, however, be entertained whether R. R. Smith was\r\n_lawfully_ sheriff when he received and delivered the votes to his\r\ndeputy, the case contains facts which in another view of the subject\r\nare important. It appears that R. R. Smith was appointed sheriff of\r\nOtsego on the 17th of February, 1791, and afterwards entered upon the\r\nexecution of his office: that no other person was in the execution of\r\nor claimed the office after the date of his appointment, and before\r\nthe time when he received and delivered the votes of the county to his\r\ndeputy; that during that interval R. R. Smith was sheriff, or the\r\ncounty was without a sheriff; that R. R. Smith, during the election,\r\nand when he received and delivered the votes to his deputy, continued\r\nin the actual exercise of the shrievalty, and that under colour of a\r\nregular appointment. From this statement it may be inferred, that if\r\nR. R. Smith, when he received and delivered the votes to his deputy,\r\nwas not _de jure_, he was _de facto_, sheriff of Otsego.\r\n\r\n\"Though all the acts of an officer _de facto_ may not be valid, and\r\nsuch of them as are merely voluntary and exclusively beneficial to\r\nhimself are void; yet such acts as tend to the public utility, and\r\nsuch as be would be compellable to perform, such as are essential to\r\npreserve the rights of third persons, and without which they might be\r\nlost or destroyed, when done by an officer _de facto_, are valid.\r\n\r\n\"I am therefore of opinion, that admitting R. R. Smith, when he\r\nreceived and delivered the votes to his deputy, was not _de jure_\r\nsheriff, yet that he was _de facto_ sheriff; and that his receiving\r\nand delivering the votes being acts done under colour of authority,\r\ntending to the public utility, and necessary to the carrying into\r\neffect the rights of suffrage of the citizens of that county, they are\r\nand ought to be deemed valid; and consequently the votes of that\r\ncounty may lawfully be canvassed.\r\n\r\n\"2d Question. The preceding answer to the first question renders an\r\nanswer to the second unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"3d and 4th Questions. The sheriff is required to put into one box\r\nevery enclosure delivered to him by an inspector appointed for that\r\npurpose by the inspectors of any town or district; and for omitting to\r\nput any such enclosure into the box, he is liable to prosecution; but\r\nin case of such omission, the votes put into the box, and seasonably\r\ndelivered into the secretary's office, may, notwithstanding such\r\nomission, be lawfully canvassed; and equally so whether the omitted\r\nenclosure be kept back or sent forward with the box to the secretary's\r\noffice. I am therefore of opinion that the votes contained in the box\r\nmay lawfully be canvassed; that those contained in a separate packet,\r\nfrom considerations explained in the depositions, and distinct from\r\nthe objection of not being included within the box, cannot be lawfully\r\ncanvassed.\r\n\r\n\"CLINTON.--The deputy having no interest in the office of sheriff, but\r\nbeing merely the sheriff's servant, it does not seem to be necessary\r\nthat the evidence of his being employed or made a deputy should be a\r\ndeed or an instrument in writing, though the latter would be proper;\r\nyet a deputy may be made by _parole_: I am therefore inclined to the\r\nopinion that the votes of Clinton may be canvassed.\r\n\r\n\"TIOGA.--The sheriff is one who executes an office in person or by\r\ndeputy, so far at least as the office is ministerial; when a deputy is\r\nrequired of the sheriff conomine, he may execute it in person or by\r\ndeputy; but if the deputy appoints a deputy, it may be doubtful\r\nwhether ordinarily the acts of the last deputy are the acts of the\r\nsheriff. The present instance is an extreme case; had the duty been\r\ncapable of being performed within the county, the sheriff or another\r\ndeputy could have performed. Here the deputy, being in the execution\r\nof his duty, and without the county, is prevented by the act of God\r\nfrom completing it; the sheriff could not appoint, and the deputy\r\nundertakes to appoint a deputy to finish his duty, who accordingly\r\ndoes so. The election law is intended to render effectual the\r\nconstitutional right of suffrage; it should therefore be construed\r\nliberally, and the means should be in subordination to the end.\r\n\r\n\"In this case it may be reasonably doubted whether the canvassers are\r\nobliged to reject the votes of Tioga.\r\n\r\n\"RUFUS KING.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burr's opinion to the Canvassers._\r\n\r\n\"OTSEGO.--The duration of the office of sheriff in England having been\r\nlimited by statute to one year, great inconveniences were experienced,\r\nas well by suiters as by the public. To remove which it was thought\r\nnecessary to pass an act of parliament. The statute of 12 Ed. IV., ch.\r\n1, recites at large these inconveniences, and authorizes the sheriff\r\nto execute and return writs in the term of St. Michael, before the\r\ndelivery of a writ of discharge, notwithstanding the expiration of the\r\nyear. The authority given by this statute being to execute only\r\ncertain specified duties, the remedy was not complete, and another\r\nstatute [1] was soon after passed, permitting sheriffs to do every act\r\npertaining to the office, during the term of St. Michael and St.\r\nHilary, after the expiration of the year, if not sooner discharged.\r\nThe practice in England appears to have been conformable to these\r\nstatutes, [2] though the king did pretend to dispense with them by\r\nforce of the royal prerogative; and this claim and exercise of a power\r\nin the crown to dispense with and control the operation of statutes,\r\nhas been long and universally condemned as odious and\r\nunconstitutional; yet the form of the commission is said still to be\r\nduring pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"These considerations tend to show the principles of several opinions\r\nand adjudications, which are found in English law-books, relative to\r\nthe holding over of the office of sheriff.\r\n\r\n\"None of the statutes of England or Great Britain continued to be laws\r\nof this state after the first of May, 1778. So that at present there\r\nremains no pretence for adopting any other than the obvious meaning of\r\nthe constitution, which limits the duration of the office to one year,\r\nbeyond which the authority to hold cannot be derived from the\r\nconstitution, the appointment, or the commission. If inconveniences\r\narise, remedies can be provided by _law only_, as has in similar cases\r\nbeen done in England, deciding on legal principles; therefore, the\r\nappointment and commission, and with them the authority of Mr. Smith,\r\nmust be deemed to have expired on the 18th of February.\r\n\r\n\"Yet there are instances of offices being exercised by persons holding\r\nunder an authority apparently good, but which, on strict legal\r\nexamination, proves defective; whose acts, nevertheless, are, with\r\n_some limitations_, considered as valid. This authority is called\r\n_colourable_, and the officer in such cases is said to be an officer\r\n_de facto_; which intends an intermediate state between an exercise\r\nstrictly lawful and one without such colour of right. Mr. Smith does\r\nnot appear to me to have holden the office of sheriff on the 3d of May\r\nunder such colour or pretence of right. The term of his office had\r\nexpired, and he had formally expressed his determination not to accept\r\na reappointment; after the expiration of the year he accepted, and\r\neven two days before the receipt of the ballots, openly exercised an\r\noffice incompatible with that of sheriff; and it is to be inferred,\r\nfrom the tenour of the affidavits, that he then knew of the\r\nappointment of Mr. Gilbert. The assumption of this authority by Mr.\r\nSmith does not even appear to have been produced by any urgent public\r\nnecessity or imminent public inconvenience. Mr. Gilbert was qualified\r\nin season to have discharged the duty, and, for aught that is shown,\r\nhis attendance, if really desired, might have been procured still\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\"Upon all the circumstances of this case, I am of opinion,\r\n\r\n\"1. That Mr. Smith was not sheriff of Otsego when he received and\r\nforwarded the ballots.\r\n\r\n\"2d. That the ballots delivered by the deputy of Mr. Smith cannot be\r\nlegally canvassed.\r\n\r\n\"The direction of the law is positive, that the sheriff shall put all\r\nthe enclosures into one box. How far his inattention or misconduct in\r\nthis particular shall be deemed to vitiate the ballots of a county,\r\nappears to be left to the judgment of the canvassers. Were the ballots\r\nof this county subject to no other exception than that stated in the\r\nthird and fourth questions, I should incline to think it one of those\r\ncases in which the discretion of the canvassers might be safely\r\nexercised, and that the ballots contained in the boxes might be\r\nlegally canvassed; those in the separate package do not appear to be\r\nsubject to such discretionary power; the law does not _permit_ them to\r\nbe estimated. But the extent to which this power might be exercised in\r\ncases similar in kind, but varying in degree, cannot be precisely\r\ndefined. Instances may doubtless be supposed, in which sound\r\ndiscretion would require that the whole should be rejected.\r\n\r\n\"Clinton.----To the question relative to the ballots of this county,\r\nit may suffice to say, that verbal and written deputation by a sheriff\r\nare, in law, considered as of equal validity, particularly when it is\r\nto perform a single ministerial act.\r\n\r\n\"Tioga.----it is said that a deputy may make a deputy to discharge\r\ncertain duties merely ministerial; but, considering the importance of\r\nthe trust in regard of the care of the ballots, and the extreme\r\ncircumspection which is indicated in the law relative to elections, I\r\nthink that the ballots of this county cannot, by any fiction or\r\nconstruction, be said to have been delivered _by the sheriff_; and am\r\nof opinion that they ought not to be canvassed.\r\n\r\n\"AARON BURR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Rufus King in this case was concurred in by Stephen\r\nLush, T. V. W. Graham, and Abraham Van Vechten, of Albany; Richard\r\nHarrison, John Lawrence, John Cozine, Cornelius J. Bogart, Robert\r\nTroup, James M. Hughes, and Thomas Cooper, of New-York.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Colonel Burr was sustained by Pierpont Edwards of\r\nConnecticut, Jonathan D. Sergeant, of Philadelphia, Edmund Randolph,\r\nof Virginia, United States attorney-general, Zephaniah Swift, Moses\r\nCleaveland, Asher Miller, David Daggett, Nathaniel Smith, and Dudley\r\nBaldwin. These opinions were procured by Colonel Burr, as appears from\r\nthe private correspondence on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JONATHAN D. SERGEANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 4th May, 1792.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the date of the enclosed that it has been ready\r\nsome time, but I have waited in hopes that I should have the pleasure\r\nof sending forward Mr. Randolph's opinion in company with mine. As he\r\nis not yet quite ready, and I am going out of town, I send forward my\r\nown singly. He is very solicitous to collect all possible information\r\non the subject before he gives his opinion, and would willingly excuse\r\nhimself from the task, were it not, as he says, that it would look\r\nlike a want of that independence and firmness which dispose a man to\r\nmeet any question, however important or strongly contended.\r\n\r\nHis opinion hitherto has been conformable to yours, and I expect will\r\ncontinue so. When it is ready I will forward it without the delay of\r\nsending it round to Dr. Edwards's in the country. The doctor had\r\nspoken to me some time before your letter came to me, so that I was\r\nnearly prepared when I received yours.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJONATHAN D. SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November, 1792, the legislature met. On the 13th,\r\npetitions, memorials, &c. were presented to the House of Assembly,\r\ndemanding an inquiry into the conduct of the board appointed to\r\ncanvass the votes given for governor, &c. at the preceding election,\r\nheld in the month of April. On the 21st the house, in committee of the\r\nwhole, took up the subject. Witnesses were examined at the bar;\r\nvarious resolutions and modifications were offered and rejected. The\r\ndebate was continued at intervals from the 21st of November, 1792,\r\nuntil the 18th of July, 1793. The minority of the canvassers entered a\r\nprotest against the proceedings of the majority, which it is due to\r\nthem to insert here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Protest of Messrs. Jones, Roosevelt, and Gansevoort_.\r\n\r\n\"We, the subscribers, members of the joint committee appointed to\r\ncanvass and estimate the votes taken at the last election in this\r\nstate for governor, lieutenant-governor, and senators, do dissent\r\nfrom, and protest against, the determination of the major part of said\r\ncommittee respecting the votes taken at the said election in the\r\ncounty of Otsego.\r\n\r\n\"I. Because these votes having been given by the freeholders of\r\nOtsego, and the packages containing the same having been received and\r\ntransmitted in season to the secretary's office by the person acting\r\nas sheriff of the county, the committee have no right to reject them\r\nunder the pretence of judging of the legality, validity, operation, or\r\nextent of the sheriff's authority or commission; these commissions\r\nbeing foreign to the duty of their appointment, and capable of a\r\ndecision only in the ordinary courts of law.\r\n\r\n\"II. Because, if the committee were by law authorized to examine and\r\ndetermine the legality and extent of the sheriff's authority and\r\ncommission, we are of opinion that Richard R. Smith, at the time he\r\nreceived and transmitted the ballots, was the lawful sheriff of\r\nOtsego. By the constitution, the sheriff, whatever may be the form of\r\nhis commission, must hold his office during the pleasure of the\r\nCouncil of Appointment; and, by the law of the land, he must continue\r\ntherein until another is appointed and takes upon himself the office.\r\nRichard R. Smith, having been appointed on the 27th of February, 1791,\r\nand Benjamin Gilbert having been appointed on the 30th of March, 1792,\r\nbut not having qualified or taken upon himself the office until\r\nRichard R. Smith had received and forwarded the same, must be deemed\r\nthe lawful sheriff of the county. The uniform practice which has\r\nprevailed since the establishment of the constitution, precludes all\r\ndoubt respecting its true construction on this point. For although the\r\ncommissions of the sheriffs are for one year, they have nevertheless\r\ncontinued to exercise the office until others were appointed and\r\nentered upon the execution thereof, which has often been long after\r\nthe expiration of the year, and sometimes after the same person has\r\nremained in office more than four years successively. And such\r\nsheriffs, sometimes after the expiration of their year, at others\r\nafter having held the office for four successive years, have received\r\nand transmitted ballots for governor, lieutenant-governor, and\r\nsenators, which ballots have on former elections been received and\r\ncanvassed; and even upon the present canvass, the committee have\r\ncanvassed the ballots taken in the counties of Kings, Orange, and\r\nWashington, notwithstanding the year had expired for which the\r\nsheriffs of these counties were commissioned, and no new commissions\r\nhad been issued. Hence the sheriffs of those counties, in receiving\r\nand transmitting the ballots, must have acted under their former\r\ncommissions, since a mere appointment without a commission, and a\r\ncompliance with the requisites prescribed by law, could not, in our\r\nopinion, give any authority as sheriff to the person so appointed.\r\n\r\n\"III. Because, if Richard R. Smith, at the time he received and\r\nforwarded the ballots, was not sheriff, the county was without a\r\nsheriff, a position too mischievous to be established by a doubtful\r\nconstruction of law.\r\n\r\n\"IV. Because, if Richard R. Smith was not of right sheriff of the\r\ncounty at the time he received and forwarded the ballots, he was then\r\nsheriff in fact of that county; and all the acts of such an officer\r\nwhich tend to the public utility, or to preserve and render effectual\r\nthe rights of third persons, are valid in law.\r\n\r\n\"V. Because, in all doubtful cases, the committee ought, in our\r\nopinion, to decide in favour of the votes given by the citizens, lest\r\nby too nice and critical an exposition of the law the rights of\r\nsuffrage be rendered nugatory.\r\n\r\n\"We also dissent from, and protest against, the determination of the\r\nmajor part of the said committee respecting the votes taken at the\r\nsaid election in the county of Clinton;\r\n\r\n\"Because it appears that the sheriff of the said county deputed a\r\nperson by parole to deliver the box containing the ballots of the said\r\ncounty into the secretary's office. Such deputation we deem to be\r\nsufficient; and as there is satisfactory evidence that the box was\r\ndelivered in the same state in which it was received from the sheriff,\r\nthe votes, in our opinion, ought to be canvassed.\r\n\r\n\"We also dissent from, and protest against, the determination of the\r\nmajor part of the said committee, by which they declare that George\r\nClinton was, by the greatest number of votes taken at the last\r\nelection for governor, lieutenant-governor, and senators, chosen\r\ngovernor of this state; and that Pierre Van Courtlandt was, by the\r\ngreatest number of votes at the said election, chosen\r\nlieutenant-governor; and that John Livingston was, by the greatest\r\nnumber of votes at the said election, in the eastern district of this\r\nstate, chosen a senator in the said eastern district.\r\n\r\n\"Because it cannot be ascertained whether George Clinton was chosen\r\ngovernor, or Pierre Van Courtlandt lieutenant-governor of this state,\r\nby the greatest number of votes at the last election, without\r\nexamining the ballots contained in the boxes delivered into the\r\nsecretary's office by the sheriffs of the counties of Otsego and\r\nClinton--there being a sufficient number of freeholders in these\r\ncounties, with the votes given in the other parts of the state for\r\nJohn Jay as governor and Stephen Van Rensselaer as\r\nlieutenant-governor, to give them a majority of votes for those\r\noffices. Nor can it be ascertained whether John Livingston was chosen\r\na senator in the eastern district by the greatest number of votes in\r\nthat district, without examining the votes taken in the county of\r\nClinton--there being a sufficient number of freeholders in that\r\ncounty, with the votes given in other parts of the district for Thomas\r\nJenkins as a senator, to give him a greater number of votes for a\r\nsenator than the number given for the said John Livingston.\r\n\r\n\"SAMUEL JONES,\r\n\r\n\"ISAAC ROOSEVELT,\r\n\r\n\"LEONARD GANSEVOORT.\"\r\n\r\nJoshua Sands, another member of the board of canvassers, entered\r\nseparately a protest, but substantially the same as the preceding.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the canvassers presented a document to the\r\nlegislature, in which they assigned their reasons for the course they\r\nhad pursued. That document was drawn by Colonel Burr. The original\r\ndraught, with his emendations, has been preserved among his papers. On\r\nthe motion of a member, it was read in the house the 28th day of\r\nDecember, 1792, and is entered at large on their journals as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"_The reasons assigned by the majority of the Canvassers in\r\nvindication of their conduct_.\r\n\r\n\"The joint committee appointed to canvass and estimate the votes for\r\ngovernor, lieutenant-governor, and senators at the last election,\r\nhaving been constrained, by a sense of their duty in the discharge of\r\nthe trust reposed in them, to reject the ballots returned from the\r\ncounties of Clinton, Otsego, and Tioga; and perceiving that attempts\r\nare made to misrepresent as well the principles of their determination\r\nas the facts on which they are founded, feel it incumbent on them to\r\nstate the grounds of their decision.\r\n\r\n\"CLINTON AND TIOGA.--A box, said to contain the ballots of the county\r\nof Clinton, was deposited in the secretary's office by a Theodore\r\nPlatt, without any deputation or other authority, accompanied only by\r\nhis own affidavit, that he had received the said box from the sheriff\r\nof Clinton.\r\n\r\nAnother box, said to contain the ballots of the county of Tioga, was\r\ndelivered by the sheriff of the county of Tioga to his deputy,\r\nBenjamin Hovey, who, being detained by illness on the road, delivered\r\nthe said box to one James H. Thompson, by whom it was deposited in the\r\nsecretary's office.\r\n\r\n\"The joint committee, pursuant to the law, are sworn to canvass the\r\nvotes 'contained in the boxes delivered into the office of the\r\nsecretary of the state by the sheriffs of the several counties.' Hence\r\narose a question, whether this was not a _personal trust_, which could\r\nnot be legally performed by deputy? Upon this point we entertained\r\ndifferent opinions; but agreed that, if the discretion of the\r\ncommittee was to be in any degree controlled by the directions of the\r\nlaw, there appeared no room to doubt of the illegality of canvassing\r\nboxes which were not delivered by a sheriff or the deputy of a\r\nsheriff. The ballots contained in these boxes were therefore rejected;\r\nnot, however, without sensible regret, as no suspicion was entertained\r\nof the fairness of those elections.\r\n\r\n\"OTSEGO.---It appears that Richard R. Smith, on the 17th of February,\r\n1791, was appointed sheriff of the county of Otsego, to hold that\r\noffice until the 18th of February, 1792; that a commission was issued\r\nagreeably to that appointment; that on the 13th of January, 1792, he\r\nwrote to the governor and council that he should decline a\r\nreappointment; that on the 30th of March, 1792, Benjamin Gilbert was\r\nappointed sheriff of the said county; that the commission to the said\r\nBenjamin Gilbert was, on the 13th of April, 1792, delivered to Stephen\r\nVan Rensselaer, one of the Council of Appointment, to be by him\r\nforwarded; that the said commission was in the hands of William\r\nCooper, Esq., first judge of the said county, on or before the 3d of\r\nMay; that the said Richard R. Smith, on the first Tuesday in April,\r\nwas elected supervisor of the town of Otsego, accepted that office,\r\nand on the 1st day of May took his seat at the board of supervisors,\r\nassisted in the appointment of loan officers, and _then_ declared that\r\nhe was no longer sheriff of the county, but that Benjamin Gilbert was\r\nappointed in his place. It also appeared that Benjamin Gilbert had no\r\nnotice of his said appointment, or of the receiving of the ballots by\r\nthe said Richard R. Smith, until the 9th day of May, and that he was\r\nsworn to the execution of the office on the 11th; that, on the 3d of\r\nMay, the said Richard R. Smith put up the ballots of the said county\r\nin the store of the said William Cooper, Esq., in whose hands the\r\ncommission of Benjamin Gilbert then was; that the box said to contain\r\nthe votes of the said county was delivered into the secretary's office\r\nby Leonard Goes previous to the last Tuesday in May, under a\r\ndeputation from the said Richard R. Smith; together with the said box,\r\nand at the same time, the said Leonard Goes delivered a separate\r\npacket or enclosure, which, by an endorsement thereon, purported to\r\ncontain 'the ballots received from the town of Cherry Valley, in the\r\ncounty of Otsego.'\r\n\r\n\"The manner of the delivery of the said box and enclosure, and the\r\nauthority of the said Leonard Goes, were reported to the committee by\r\nthe secretary of the state.\r\n\r\n\"These votes were not canvassed for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n\"1. The committee found themselves bound, by their oath and by the\r\ndirections of the law before mentioned, to canvass only the votes\r\ncontained in the boxes which may have been delivered into the\r\nsecretary's office by the _sheriffs_ of the several counties. It\r\nappeared to them absurd to suppose this duty should be so expressly\r\nenjoined, and that they should nevertheless be prohibited from\r\ninquiring whether the boxes were or were not delivered by such\r\nofficers; or that they should be restrained from ascertaining a fact,\r\nwithout the knowledge of which it was impossible that they could\r\ndischarge the duty with certainty to the public or with confidence to\r\nthemselves. They could not persuade themselves that they were, under\r\n_that_ law and _that_ oath, compelled to canvass and estimate votes,\r\nhowever fraudulently obtained, which should be delivered into the\r\nsecretary's office _by any person styling_ himself sheriff, though it\r\nshould at the same time be evident to them that he was _not the\r\nsheriff_. If such was to be their conduct, a provision intended as a\r\nsecurity against impositions would be an engine to promote them. They\r\nconceived, therefore, that the objection to an inquiry so important,\r\nand in a case where the question was raised and the inquiry imposed\r\nupon them by the suggestions of the secretary, must have arisen from\r\ngross misrepresentation or willful error.\r\n\r\n\"Upon investigating the right of the said Richard R. Smith to exercise\r\nthat office, the facts appeared as herein-before stated.\r\n\r\n\"2. The constitution requires that sheriffs shall be _annually\r\nappointed_; which, to our apprehension, implies that no person shall\r\nexercise the office by virtue of any other than an _annual_\r\nappointment. And should it even be admitted that the council may, at\r\n_their pleasure_, remove a sheriff within the year, yet we do not see\r\non what ground it can be denied that the duration of the office is\r\nlimited to one year, unless a new appointment should take place. It\r\nwould otherwise be true that the council could indirectly, or by a\r\ncriminal omission, accomplish what is not within their direct or legal\r\nauthority. It will be readily admitted that an appointment and\r\ncommission for three years would be void; and surely the pretence of\r\none thus claiming should be preferred to a usurpation without even\r\nsuch appearance of right, and against the known right of another. To\r\nassert, therefore, that 'by the constitution the sheriff, whatever may\r\nbe the form of his commission, must hold his office during the\r\npleasure of the Council of Appointment; and that, by the law of the\r\nland, he must continue therein until another is appointed and has\r\ntaken upon himself the office,' is an assertion accompanied with no\r\nproof or reason, and is repugnant to the letter and spirit of the\r\nconstitution, which is eminently _the law of the land_. The practice\r\nwhich has prevailed since the revolution, as far as hath come to our\r\nknowledge, does not warrant the position; neither could mere practice,\r\nif such had prevailed, justify the adoption of a principle contrary to\r\nthe obvious meaning of the constitution. Upon the present occasion we\r\nhave not canvassed the votes of any county which were not returned by\r\na sheriff holding his office under an appointment unexpired. The\r\nsheriffs of Kings, Orange, and Washington had all been reappointed\r\nwithin the present year, which satisfied the words of the\r\nconstitution, and was the _known_ and avowed reason which influenced\r\nthe committee to estimate the ballots of those counties. The doctrine\r\nconcerning the constitutional pleasure of the council in the\r\nappointment of the office of sheriffs _had not then been invented_.\r\n\r\n\"3. But even admitting the visionary idea that the office of sheriff\r\n(_whose duration is limited by the constitution_) can nevertheless be\r\nholden _during the pleasure_ of the Council of Appointment, yet that\r\nappears to have been determined by the letter of the appointment and\r\ncommission, by the appointment of Benjamin Gilbert, by the declaration\r\nof Richard R. Smith, and by his acceptance and exercise of another\r\noffice, which is, by the constitution, declared to be incompatible\r\nwith the office of sheriff.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident, therefore, that Richard R. Smith had no authority by\r\nappointment, by commission, by the constitution, or by any law, to\r\nhold or exercise the office of sheriff on the third of May.\r\n\r\n\"4. As Richard R. Smith was not legally or constitutionally sheriff on\r\nthe third of May, neither, under the circumstances of the case, can he\r\nbe said to have been sheriff in fact, so as to render his acts valid\r\nin contemplation of law: the assumption of power by Mr. Smith appears\r\nto have been warranted by no pretence or colour of right. The time\r\nlimited for the duration of his office had expired by the express\r\ntenure of his commission and appointment, and he had formally declared\r\nhis determination not to accept a reappointment. He had, two days\r\nprevious to his receiving the ballots, openly exercised an office\r\nincompatible with that of sheriff; then declared that he had resigned\r\nthe office of sheriff, and that Benjamin Gilbert was appointed in his\r\nplace; and by an affidavit which was produced to the committee, it\r\nappeared that, upon the day upon which he had put up the ballots in\r\nthe house of the said William Cooper, he, the said Richard R. Smith,\r\ndeclared that he had resigned the office of sheriff. The business\r\nmight with equal care and certainty have been executed by Benjamin\r\nGilbert. The single act of receiving ballots could of itself continue\r\n_no man_ a sheriff--least of all _a man disavowing that office, and\r\nthen in the exercise of another_. It was foreign to the duty of the\r\ncommittee to provide against evils which may possibly arise from\r\ncasual vacancies in the office of sheriff by death and otherwise.\r\nVacancies will sometimes unavoidably happen, without further\r\nlegislative provision.\r\n\r\n\"There is not, therefore, in our opinion, any application to the\r\nsubject, or force in the objection, 'that if Richard R. Smith was not\r\nsheriff, the county was without a sheriff;' neither is the position\r\ntrue in fact, for it appears that the county was not then without a\r\nsheriff. At the time the ballots were received, it was well known that\r\nBenjamin Gilbert was appointed sheriff, and that his commission was in\r\nthe hands of William Cooper, in whose store Richard R. Smith put up\r\nthe ballots. It is also to be fairly inferred that, had proper\r\nmeasures been taken to give notice to Mr. Gilbert, he would forthwith\r\nhave qualified and undertaken the execution of the office. It cannot,\r\ntherefore, consistent with truth or candour, be asserted that there\r\nwas the remotest probability that 'mischiefs' could in any parallel\r\ncase ensue from the principles adopted by the committee.\r\n\r\n\"It did not seem possible, therefore, by any principle of law, by any\r\nlatitude of construction, to canvass and estimate the ballots\r\ncontained in the box thus circumstanced.\r\n\r\n\"But, had the question been doubtful, it was attended by other\r\ncircumstances, which would have determined the committee against\r\ncanvassing those ballots.\r\n\r\n\"5. Because the notice of the appointment of Benjamin Gilbert was\r\nreceived by Richard R. Smith on or before the first of May, and his\r\ncommission was received by William Cooper on or before the third of\r\nMay. Mr. Gilbert might therefore have been notified, qualified, and\r\nexecuted the duty. He did actually qualify on the eleventh, which gave\r\nample time to have forwarded the ballots before the last Tuesday in\r\nMay. These facts, with other suggestions of unfair practices, rendered\r\nthe conduct of the Otsego election justly liable to suspicion; and the\r\ncommittee were constrained to conclude that the usurpation of\r\nauthority by Richard R. Smith was wanton and unnecessary, and\r\nproceeded from no motive connected with the preservation of the rights\r\nof the people or the freedom and _purity of elections_.\r\n\r\n\"6. Because, having in several instances, by _unanimous vote_,\r\nrejected ballots of whole towns, free from any suspicion of\r\nunfairness, by reason of a defect in _form only_ of the return, the\r\ncommittee conceived themselves the more strongly bound to reject\r\nballots where the defect was substantial, and the conduct at least\r\nquestionable; especially as the law regards the custody of enclosures\r\ncontaining the ballots as a trust of high importance, and contemplates\r\nbut three persons in whose hands they are to be confided until they\r\ncome to the possession of the canvassers, to wit, the inspector, the\r\nsheriff, and the secretary; all officers of great responsibility and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"7. Because the return, upon the face of it, appeared to be illegal.\r\nThe law requires the sheriff, 'upon receiving the said enclosure,\r\ndirected to be delivered to him as aforesaid, without opening or\r\ninspecting the same, or any or either of them, to put the said\r\nenclosures, and _every one of them, into one box_, which shall be well\r\nclosed, &c., and be delivered by him, without opening the same, or the\r\nenclosures therein contained, into the office of the secretary of this\r\nstate before the last Tuesday in May in every year.'\r\n\r\n\"By recurring to the preceding state of facts it will be evident that\r\nthis direction of the law had been disregarded. If irregularities of\r\nthis kind should be permitted and countenanced, it would be in the\r\npower of the sheriff, by excluding a part of the votes, to confer a\r\nmajority on any candidate, in counties where there were divisions of\r\ninterests. Affidavits were indeed produced tending to show that there\r\nhad been, in that town, disputes respecting the election of town\r\nofficers; that two enclosures, purporting to contain the votes of the\r\ntown, were delivered to Mr. Smith, and that he had put into the box\r\nthat enclosure which contained the votes taken by the persons whom _he\r\njudged_ to be the legal inspectors: a matter proper to have been\r\nsubmitted to the opinion of the committee.\r\n\r\n\"The committee have considered this subject with deliberate attention,\r\nand in every light in which it could be placed; and whether they\r\nregarded the channels of conveyance, the mode of the return, or the\r\ngeneral principles which ought to govern their decisions touching the\r\nfreedom of elections and security against frauds, they found\r\nundeniable reasons which compelled them to reject the votes.\r\n\r\n\"DAVID GELSTON,\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS TILLOTSON,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL GRAHAM,\r\n\r\n\"MELANCTON SMITH,\r\n\r\n\"DAVID M'CARTY,\r\n\r\n\"P.V.

Ays 35. Nays 22.\r\n\r\nAmong the individuals for whom Colonel Burr entertained a high degree\r\nof respect, was Jacob De Lamater, Esq., of Marbletown. Between these\r\ngentlemen, for several years, a friendly, and, in some instances, a\r\nconfidential correspondence existed. Mr. De Lamater was a federalist,\r\nbut personally attached to Colonel Burr. In 1792 he was among those\r\nwho wished him to become a candidate for the office of governor. After\r\nthe death of De Lamater, the letters addressed to him by Colonel Burr\r\nwere returned. They were written under the sacred seal of friendship;\r\nbut they contain not a sentence, not a word, that is not alike\r\nhonourable to his head and his heart. One is selected and here\r\npublished as explanatory of his _feelings_ and his _conduct_ in the\r\ncontested election (which so much agitated the State of New-York)\r\nbetween George Clinton and John Jay. It requires no comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DE LAMATER\r\n\r\nNew-York, 15th June, 1792.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYou will, before this can reach you, have heard of the event of the\r\nlate election. Some questions having arisen among the canvassers\r\nrespecting the returns from Clinton, Otsego, and Tioga, they requested\r\nthe advice of Mr. King and myself. We conferred, and, unfortunately,\r\ndiffered; particularly as to the questions upon the Otsego return. I\r\ntherefore proposed that we should decline giving any opinion, being\r\nfor my own part much averse to interfere in the business. Mr. King,\r\nhowever, determined to give his separate opinion, from what motives\r\nyou may judge. This laid me under the necessity of giving mine also,\r\nwhich I did. If I can procure copies of both opinions, and of the\r\nprotest of the minority, and the reasons assigned by the majority of\r\nthe canvassers, I will send them herewith. They will enable you to\r\nform a competent judgment of the law question, and of the fairness of\r\nthe Otsego return.\r\n\r\nI do not see how any unbiased man can doubt, but still I do not\r\npretend to control the opinion of others, much less to take offence at\r\nany man for differing from me. The reasons contained in my opinion,\r\nand assigned by the majority of the canvassers, have never been\r\nanswered except by abuse. I can, in a personal interview, inform you\r\nof some circumstances relative to the opinions which have been\r\nprocured in favour of the Otsego votes.\r\n\r\nI have heard with much pride and pleasure of the warm and\r\ndisinterested manner in which I was espoused by some respectable\r\ncharacters in your county. I shall never fail to recollect it with\r\nsensibility and gratitude. It would therefore give me real pain to\r\nbelieve that any part of my conduct had tended to thwart their wishes.\r\nIf it has had any such effect, it should at least be remembered that I\r\ndid not seek to gratify any wish or interest of my own. I took no part\r\nin the election. I never gave to any person the most distant\r\nintimation that I supposed you engaged to support Mr. Clinton, or to\r\ntake any other part than that which your inclinations and judgment\r\nshould direct. I felt no disposition to influence your conduct on that\r\noccasion. Had I been so inclined, I have no doubt but I could, in\r\nvarious parts of the state, have essentially injured Mr. Jay's\r\ninterest; but I made no attempt of the kind. Yet I shall never yield\r\nup the right of expressing my opinions. I have never exacted that\r\ntribute from another.\r\n\r\nUpon the late occasion, indeed, I earnestly wished and sought to be\r\nrelieved from the necessity of giving any opinion, particularly from a\r\nknowledge that it would be disagreeable to you and a few others whom I\r\nrespect and wish always to gratify. But the conduct of Mr. King left\r\nme no alternative. I was obliged to give an opinion, and I have not\r\nyet learned to give any other than which my judgment directs.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be the extreme of weakness in me to expect\r\nfriendship from Mr. Clinton. I have too many reasons to believe that\r\nhe regards me with jealousy and malevolence. Still, this alone ought\r\nnot to have induced me to refuse my advice to the canvassers. Some\r\npretend, indeed, but none can believe, that I am prejudiced in his\r\nfavour. I have not even seen or spoken to him since January last. I\r\nwish to merit the flattering things you say of my talents; but your\r\nexpressions of esteem and regard are still more flattering, and these,\r\nI am sure, I shall never fail to merit, if the warmest friendship and\r\nunalterable attachment can give me a claim.\r\n\r\nWill you be abroad any, and what part of the summer? I ask, because I\r\npropose to make you a visit on my way to, or return from, Albany, and\r\nwish to be certain of finding you at home. No political changes can\r\never diminish the pleasure with which I subscribe myself\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter is evidence of Colonel Burr's propensity to\r\ncorrespond in cipher with his most intimate friends, even on\r\nunimportant topics. Hundreds of the same character might be given.\r\n\r\nTO JACOB DE LAMATER.\r\n\r\nNew-York, October 30th, 1792\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter by Mr. Addison was particularly kind, after my long\r\n_supposed_ silence. We may make use of _both keys or ciphers_, and if\r\nsome of the persons or things are designated by different characters,\r\nno inconvenience will arise; if there should, we will correct it.\r\n\r\n_V_ is to be the candidate, as my former letter will have told you: He\r\nhas the wishes of 9 for his success, for reasons which will be obvious\r\nto you. Do you think that 8 would be induced from any motive to vote\r\nfor him?\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. 17 Ed., ch. 7, more general.\r\n\r\n2. 2 Hawks., 5, 51, Irish oct. edit., 2 mod. 261 statute 1 Wm. and\r\nMary, sess. 2, ch. 2. See also sec. 12 of the same statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of October, 1792, Governor Clinton nominated Colonel Burr to\r\nthe Council of Appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court of the state,\r\nwhich nomination was immediately confirmed. Thus, within the short\r\nspace of about three years, he was appointed by the democratic party\r\nto the several important stations of Attorney-General, Senator of the\r\nUnited States, and Judge of the Supreme Court. The last appointment\r\nwas made without consulting Mr. Burr. As soon as he was notified of\r\nthe fact, he informed the governor of his non-acceptance; yet so\r\nanxious was his excellency, and so strong were his hopes that Colonel\r\nBurr might be induced to withdraw his resignation, that be refused to\r\nlay it before the council until the legislature, on the 7th of\r\nDecember, adopted the following resolution--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it appears to the legislature, by the records of the Council\r\nof Appointment, that Aaron Burr, Esq., one of the senators for this\r\nstate in the Senate of the United States, was, on the 2d day of\r\nOctober last, appointed one of the puisne justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Judicature of this state: Thereupon,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_ (if the honourable the Senate concur herein), That his\r\nexcellency the governor be and hereby is requested to inform the\r\nlegislature whether the said Aaron Burr hath accepted or refused the\r\nsaid office.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October, 1791, Congress convened, and Colonel Burr took\r\nhis seat in the Senate of the United States. In those days it was the\r\npractice of the president, accompanied by the heads of departments, to\r\nproceed to Congress Hall for the purpose of meeting the two branches\r\nof the national legislature, and opening the session with a speech, to\r\nwhich a response was made by each body separately. On the 25th the\r\npresident made his annual communication; whereupon the Senate\r\n\"_Ordered_, That Messrs. Burr, Cabot, and Johnston be a committee to\r\nprepare and report the draught of an address to the President of the\r\nUnited States, in answer to his speech, delivered this day to both\r\nhouses of Congress in the Senate Chamber.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Colonel Burr, as chairman of the committee, draughted and\r\nreported an answer, which was adopted by the Senate without alteration\r\nor amendment: an occurrence, it is believed, that happened in only two\r\nother instances during the period that speeches were delivered by the\r\nexecutive. After the election of Mr. Jefferson the system of sending\r\nmessages was substituted.\r\n\r\nThe journals of the Senate afford ample evidence that Colonel Burr was\r\nan industrious and efficient member of that body. During the first\r\nsession of his term of service he was placed on numerous committees,\r\nsome of them important, and generally as chairman. His business habits\r\nsoon became evident, and were called into operation. His character for\r\nfirmness was well established before be took his seat in the Senate;\r\nbut on the 9th of January, 1794, it was displayed with effect. In\r\nconsequence of a difference between the two houses, a bill to increase\r\nthe standing army was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. King, of New-York, by consent, introduced a new bill; it was\r\nentitled \"An act for the more effectual protection of the southwestern\r\nfrontier settlers.\" Unsuccessful efforts were made by Colonel Burr and\r\nothers to amend it, by striking out some of its most odious features;\r\nbut there was a decided majority, as it was known to be an\r\nadministration measure, determined on carrying it through. The bill\r\nwas ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and the question on\r\nits passage was to be taken on the last day of the session. By the\r\nrules of the Senate, the question could not be put if any member\r\nobjected. Colonel Burr objected, and the bill was thus defeated.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his public engagements, Colonel Burr's mind was\r\nconstantly employed with the education of his daughter. Mrs. Burr's\r\nhealth was gradually declining, insomuch that she was unable, at\r\ntimes, to attend to her domestic concerns. This to him was a source of\r\nunceasing care and apprehension. His letters to his daughter are\r\nnumerous. They are frequently playful, always interesting, displaying\r\nthe solicitude of an affectionate father anxious for the improvement\r\nof his child.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 18th January, 1793.\r\n\r\nBy the enclosed to Mr. Gurney, [1] I have requested him to write me a\r\nletter respecting the health of the family, and Theo.'s improvement.\r\nRequest him to enclose, on a separate sheet, some columns of figures,\r\npounds, shillings, and pence. I shall show the letter and enclosure as\r\na specimen of his talents to some persons to whom I wish to recommend\r\nhim. Beg him to use no uncommon word or expression. He will pardon\r\nthis piece of advice when he recollects that I know so much better\r\nthan he does what will suit the persons to whom it is to be shown. If\r\nhe should offer his letter for your perusal before he sends it, remark\r\nfreely; it will be a kindness of which no one is so capable.\r\n\r\nShould this come to hand after he has given his lesson on Saturday,\r\nsend him his letter, and request him to call on you, if you should be\r\nable to bear five minutes conversation with him.\r\n\r\nI wrote you yesterday, and have nothing to add respecting myself; and\r\nonly a repetition of my prayers for you, with my most affectionate and\r\nanxious wishes.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 8th February, 1793.\r\n\r\nYou may recollect that I left a memorandum of what Theo. was to learn.\r\nI hope it has been strictly attended to. Desire Gurney not to attempt\r\nto teach her any thing about the \"concords.\" I will show him how I\r\nchoose that should be done when I return, which, I thank God, is but\r\nthree weeks distant.\r\n\r\nIt is eight days since I left home, and I have not a word from any one\r\nof the family, nor even about any one of them. I have been out but\r\nonce, half an hour at Mrs. P.'s, a concert; but I call often at Mrs.\r\nL.'s. I am more and more struck with the native good sense of one of\r\nthat family, and more and more disgusted with the manner in which it\r\nis obscured and perverted: cursed effects of fashionable education! of\r\nwhich both sexes are the advocates, and yours eminently the victims.\r\nIf I could foresee that Theo. would become a _mere_ fashionable woman,\r\nwith all the attendant frivolity and vacuity of mind, adorned with\r\nwhatever grace and allurement, I would earnestly pray God to take her\r\nforthwith hence. But I yet hope, by her, to convince the world what\r\nneither sex appear to believe--that women have souls!\r\n\r\nMost affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 15th February, 1793.\r\n\r\nI received with joy and astonishment, on entering the Senate this\r\nminute, your two elegant and affectionate letters. The mail closes in\r\na few minutes, and will scarce allow me to acknowledge your goodness.\r\nThe roads and ferries have been for some days almost impassable, so\r\nthat till now no post has arrived since Monday.\r\n\r\nIt was a knowledge of your mind which first inspired me with a respect\r\nfor that of your sex, and with some regret, I confess, that the ideas\r\nwhich you have often heard me express in favour of female intellectual\r\npowers are founded on what I have imagined, more than what I have\r\nseen, except in you. I have endeavoured to trace the causes of this\r\n_rare_ display of genius in women, and find them in the errors of\r\neducation, of prejudice, and of habit. I admit that men are equally,\r\nnay more, much more to blame than women. Boys and girls are generally\r\neducated much in the same way till they are eight or nine years of\r\nage, and it is admitted that girls make at least equal progress with\r\nthe boys; generally, indeed, they make better. Why, then, has it never\r\nbeen thought worth the attempt to discover, by fair experiment, the\r\nparticular age at which the male superiority becomes so evident? But\r\nthis is not in answer to your letter; neither is it possible now to\r\nanswer it. Some parts of it I shall never answer. Your allusions to\r\ndeparted angels I think in bad taste.\r\n\r\nI do not like Theo.'s indolence, or the apologies which are made for\r\nit. Have my directions been pursued with regard to her Latin and\r\ngeography?\r\n\r\nYour plan and embellishment of my mode of life are fanciful, are\r\nflattering, and inviting. We will endeavour to realize some of it.\r\nPray continue to write, if you can do it with impunity. I bless Sir\r\nJ., who, with the assistance of Heaven, has thus far restored you.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this scrawl I have been several times called to vote,\r\nwhich must apologize to you for its incoherence. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 16th February, 1793.\r\n\r\nA line of recollection will, I am sure, be more acceptable than\r\nsilence. I consider myself as largely in your debt, and shall of\r\nnecessity remain so.\r\n\r\nYou have heard me speak of a Miss Woolstonecraft, who has written\r\nsomething on the French revolution; she has also written a book\r\nentitled \"_Vindication of the rights of Woman_.\" I had heard it spoken\r\nof with a coldness little calculated to excite attention; but as I\r\nread with avidity and prepossession every thing written by a lady, I\r\nmade haste to procure it, and spent the last night, almost the whole\r\nof it, in reading it. Be assured that your sex has in _her_ an able\r\nadvocate. It is, in my opinion, a work of genius. She has successfully\r\nadopted the style of Rousseau's Emilius; and her comment on that work,\r\nespecially what relates to female education, contains more good sense\r\nthan all the other criticisms upon him which I have seen put together.\r\nI promise myself much pleasure in reading it to you.\r\n\r\nIs it owing to ignorance or prejudice that I have not yet met a single\r\nperson who had discovered or would allow the merit of this work?\r\n\r\nThree mails are in arrear; that of Tuesday is the last which has\r\narrived. I am impatient to know how writing agrees with you. Pray let\r\nme hear, from day to day, the progress of your cure. Most\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 18th February, 1793.\r\n\r\nJust what I apprehended, I find, has taken place. Three sheets were\r\ntoo much for a first attempt. It will, I fear, discourage you, if not\r\ndisable you from more moderate experiments. Yet I will hope to receive\r\nby this day's mail at least one line, announcing your progressive\r\nrecovery, under your own hand.\r\n\r\nBe assured that, after what you have written, I shall not send for\r\nGurney. Deliver him the enclosed. I hope it may animate his attention;\r\nand tell him, if you think proper, that I shall be much dissatisfied\r\nif Theo.'s progress in Latin be not very considerable at my return.\r\nGeography has, I hope, been abandoned, for he has no talent at\r\nteaching it.\r\n\r\nThe close of a session being always crowded with business, keeps me\r\nmuch engaged. You must expect short letters--mere notes. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 20th February, 1793.\r\n\r\nAt length, my dear Theo., I have received your letter of the 20th of\r\nJanuary--written, you see, a month ago. But I observe that it was not\r\nput into the postoffice until the day before yesterday. I suppose\r\nFrederick or Bartow had carelessly put it in some place where it had\r\nlain forgotten. It would indeed have been a pity that such a letter\r\nshould have been lost. There is something in the style and arrangement\r\nof the words which would have done honour to a girl of sixteen.\r\n\r\nAll three of the Miss A.'s will visit New-York next summer, and pass\r\nsome weeks there. I hope to be at home in ten or twelve days from this\r\ntime. Let me receive one or two more letters from you, even if you are\r\nobliged to neglect a lesson to find time to write them.\r\n\r\nAlexis [2] often bids me to send you some polite and respectful\r\nmessage on his part, which I have heretofore omitted. He is a\r\nfaithful, good boy. Upon our return home he hopes you will teach him\r\nto read.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Theo.,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 24th February, 1793\r\n\r\nMY DEAR THEO.,\r\n\r\nIn looking over a list made yesterday (and now before me), of letters\r\nof consequence to be answered immediately, I find the name of T.B.\r\nBurr. At the time I made the memorandum I did not advert to the\r\ncompliment I paid you by putting your name in a list with some of the\r\nmost eminent persons in the United States. So true is it that your\r\nletters are really of consequence to _me_. I now allude to that of the\r\n19th instant, covering a fable and riddle. If the whole performance\r\nwas your own, which I am inclined to hope and believe, it indicates an\r\nimprovement in style, in knowledge of the French, and in your\r\nhandwriting. I have therefore not only read it several times, but\r\nshown it to several persons with pride and pleasure.\r\n\r\nI confess myself unable to solve your riddle, unless the _teeth_ or\r\nthe _alphabet_ (generally supposed to be twenty-four in each) will\r\ngive the solution. But I have not yet had an opportunity to consult\r\nMiss P. A. To-morrow I shall call on her for the purpose, and will not\r\nfail to inform you of her conjectures on the subject.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 16th December, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have a thousand questions to ask, my dear Theo., but nothing to\r\ncommunicate; and thus I fear it will be throughout the winter, for my\r\ntime is consumed in the dull uniformity of study and attendance in\r\nSenate; but every hour of _your_ day is interesting to _me_. I would\r\ngive, what would I not give to see or know even your most trifling\r\nactions and amusements? This, however, is more than I can ask or\r\nexpect. But I do expect with impatience your journal. Ten minutes\r\nevery evening I demand; if you should choose to make it twenty, I\r\nshall be the better pleased. You are to note the occurrences of the\r\nday as concisely as you can; and, at your pleasure, to add any short\r\nreflections or remarks that may arise. On the other leaf I give you a\r\nsample of the manner of your journal for one day.\r\n\r\n18th December,\r\n\r\nI began this letter at the date which you see, being Monday last--was\r\ninterrupted, and the mail closed. Yesterday I was confined with a\r\nsevere headache, owing, I believe, to a change from an active to a\r\nsedentary life without a corresponding change in diet.\r\n\r\nA week and more has elapsed since I left home, and not a line from\r\nyou; not even the Sunday letter. Observe, that the journal is to be\r\nsent to me enclosed in a letter every Monday morning.\r\n\r\n_Plan of the Journal._\r\n\r\n16th December, 1793.\r\n\r\nLearned 230 lines, which finished Horace. Heigh-ho for Terence and the\r\nGreek grammar to-morrow.\r\n\r\nPractised two hours less thirty-five minutes, which I begged off.\r\n\r\nHewlett (dancing-master) did not come.\r\n\r\nBegan Gibbon last evening. I find he requires as much study and\r\nattention as Horace; so I shall not rank the reading of _him_ among\r\namusements.\r\n\r\nSkated an hour; fell twenty times, and find the advantage of a hard\r\nhead and\r\n\r\nMa better--dined with us at table, and is still sitting up and free\r\nfrom pain.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 24th December, 1793.\r\n\r\nSince being at this place I have had several conversations with Dr.\r\nRush respecting your distressing illness, and I have reason to believe\r\nthat he has given the subject some reflection. He has this evening\r\ncalled on me, and given me as his advice that you should take hemlock.\r\nHe says that, in the way in which it is usually prepared, you should\r\ncommence with a dose of one tenth of a grain, and increase as you may\r\nfind you can bear it; that it has the narcotic powers of opium,\r\nsuperadded to other qualities. When the dose is too great, it may be\r\ndiscovered by a vertigo or giddiness; and that he has known it to work\r\nwonderful cures. I was the more pleased with this advice, as I had not\r\ntold him that you had been in the use of this medicine; the\r\nconcurrence of his opinion gives me great faith in it. God grant that\r\nit may restore your health, and to your affectionate\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 25th December, 1793.\r\n\r\nThe letter, my dear Theo., which (I have no doubt) you wrote me last\r\nSunday, has not yet come to hand. Am I to blame Strong? or the\r\npostmaster? or whom?\r\n\r\nWhen you have finished a letter, read it carefully over, and correct\r\nall the errors you can discover. In your last there were some which\r\ncould not, upon an attentive perusal, have escaped your notice, as you\r\nshall see when we meet.\r\n\r\nI have asked you a great many questions, to which I have as yet no\r\nanswers. When you _sit_ down to write to me, or when you _set_ about\r\nit, be it sitting or standing, peruse all my letters, and leave\r\nnothing unanswered. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 31st December, 1793.\r\n\r\nI received your letter and journal yesterday in the Senate Chamber,\r\njust before the closing of the mail, so that I had only time to\r\nacknowledge it by a hasty line. You see I never let your letters\r\nremain a day unanswered, in which I wish you would imitate me. Your\r\nlast had no date; from the last date in the journal, and your writing\r\nabout Christmas holydays as yet at some distance, I suppose you wrote\r\nabout Sunday the 22d. Nine days ago! I beg you again to read over all\r\nmy letters, and to let me see by your answers that you attend to them.\r\nI suspect your last journal was not written from day to day; but all\r\non one, or at most two days, from memory. How is this? Ten or fifteen\r\nminutes every evening would not be an unreasonable sacrifice from\r\n_you_ to _me_. If you took the Christmas holydays, I assent: if you\r\ndid not, we cannot recall the time. This is all the answer which that\r\npart of your letter now admits of.\r\n\r\nIt is said that some few yet die of the yellow fever which lately\r\nraged here; but the disorder does not appear to be, _at present_, in\r\nany degree contagious; what _may_ be the case upon the return of warm\r\nweather, is a subject of anxious conjecture and apprehension. It is\r\nprobable that the session of Congress will continue into the summer.\r\n\r\nGive a place to your mamma's health in your journal. Omit the formal\r\nconclusion of your letters, and write your name in a larger hand. I am\r\njust going to Senate, where I hope to meet a letter from you, with a\r\ncontinuation of your journal down to the 29th inclusive, which, if it\r\ngives a good account of you and mamma, will gladden the heart of\r\n\r\nA BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 31st December, 1793.\r\n\r\nThis day's mail has brought me nothing from you. I have but two\r\nletters in three, almost four weeks, and the journal is ten days in\r\narrear. What--can neither affection nor civility induce you to devote\r\nto me the small portion of time which I have required? Are authority\r\nand compulsion then the only engines by which you can be moved? For\r\nshame, Theo.! Do not give me reason to think so ill of you.\r\n\r\nI wrote you this morning, and have nothing to add but the repetition\r\nof my warmest affection.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 4th January, 1794.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of closing the mail yesterday, I received your letter\r\nenclosing the pills. I cannot refer to it by date, as it has none.\r\nTell me truly, did you write it without assistance? Is the language\r\nand spelling your own? If so, it does you much honour. The subject of\r\nit obliged me to show it to Dr. Rush, which I did with great pride. He\r\ninquired your age half a dozen times, and paid some handsome\r\ncompliments to the handwriting, the style, and the correctness of your\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe account of your mamma's health distresses me extremely. If she\r\ndoes not get better soon, I will quit Congress altogether and go home.\r\nDoctor Rush says that the pills contain two grains each of pure and\r\nfresh extract of hemlock; that the dose is not too large if the\r\nstomach and head can bear it; that he has known twenty grains given at\r\na dose with good effect. To determine, however, whether this medicine\r\nhas any agency in causing the sick stomach, he thinks it would be well\r\nto take an occasion of omitting it for a day or two, if Doctor Bard\r\nshould approve of such an experiment, and entertains any doubts about\r\nthe effects of the pills on the stomach. Some further conversation\r\nwhich I have had with Doctor Rush will be contained in a letter which\r\nI shall write by this post to Doctor Bard.\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was almost an angry one, at which you cannot be\r\nmuch surprised when you recollect the length of time of your silence,\r\nand that you are my only correspondent respecting the concerns of the\r\nfamily. I expect, on Monday or Tuesday next, to receive the\r\ncontinuation of your journal for _the fortnight past_.\r\n\r\nMr. Leshlie will tell you that I have given directions for your\r\ncommencing Greek. One half hour faithfully applied by yourself at\r\nstudy, and another at recitation with Mr. Leshlie, will suffice to\r\nadvance you rapidly.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 7th January, 1794.\r\n\r\nWhen your letters are written with tolerable spirit and correctness, I\r\nread them two or three times before I perceive any fault in them,\r\nbeing wholly engaged with the pleasure they afford me; but, for your\r\nsake, it is necessary that I should also peruse them with an eye of\r\ncriticism. The following are the only mispelled words. You write\r\n_acurate_ for _accurate_; _laudnam_ for _laudanum_; _intirely_ for\r\n_entirely_; this last word, indeed, is spelled both ways, but entirely\r\nis the most usual and the most proper.\r\n\r\nContinue to use all these words in your next letter, that I may see\r\nthat you know the true spelling. And tell me what is laudanum? Where\r\nand how made? And what are its effects?\r\n\r\n\"It was what she had long wished for, and was at a loss how to procure\r\n_it_.\"\r\n\r\nDon't you see that this sentence would have been perfect and much more\r\nelegant without the last _it_? Mr. Leshlie will explain to you why.\r\nBy-the-by, I took the liberty to erase the redundant _it_ before I\r\nshowed the letter.\r\n\r\nI am extremely impatient for your farther account of mamma's health.\r\nThe necessity of laudanum twice a day is a very disagreeable and\r\nalarming circumstance. Your letter was written a week ago, since which\r\nI have no account. I am just going to the Senate Chamber, where I hope\r\nto meet a journal and letter. Affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 8th January, 1794\r\n\r\nYour two letters of Friday and Saturday came together by yesterday's\r\nmail, which did not arrive till near sunset. Your letter of Friday was\r\nnot put into the postoffice until Saturday afternoon. You might have\r\nas well kept it in your own hands till Monday eleven o'clock. Since\r\nthe receipt of these letters I have been three times to Doctor Rush to\r\nconsult him about a drink for your mamma; but not having had the good\r\nfortune to find him, have written to him on the subject. I shall\r\nundoubtedly procure an answer in the course of this day, and will\r\nforward it by to-morrow's post.\r\n\r\nI beg, Miss Prissy, that you will be pleased to name a single\r\n\"_unsuccessful effort_\" which you have made to please me. As to the\r\nletters and journals which you _did_ write, surely you have reason\r\nabundant to believe that they gave me pleasure; and how the deuse I am\r\nto be pleased with those you _did not_ write, and how an omission to\r\nwrite can be called an \"_effort_,\" remains for your ingenuity to\r\ndisclose.\r\n\r\nYou improve much in journalizing. Your last is far more sprightly than\r\nany of the preceding. Fifty-six lines sola was, I admit, _an effort_\r\nworthy of yourself, and which I hope will be often repeated. But pray,\r\nwhen you have got up to two hundred lines a lesson, why do you go back\r\nagain to one hundred and twenty, and one hundred and twenty-five? You\r\nshould strive never to diminish; but I suppose that _vis inertiæ_,\r\nwhich is often so troublesome to you, does some times preponderate. So\r\nit is now and then even with your\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nLearn the difference between _then_ and _than_. You will soonest\r\nperceive it by translating them into Latin.\r\n\r\nLet me see how handsomely you can subscribe your name to your next\r\nletter, about this size,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DAUGHTER THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 10th of January, 1794.\r\n\r\nI fear that you will imagine that I have been inattentive to your last\r\nrequest about Dr. Rush; but the truth is, I can get nothing\r\nsatisfactory out of him. He enumerates over to me all the articles\r\nwhich have been repeatedly tried, and some of which did never agree\r\nwith your mamma. He is, however, particularly desirous that she should\r\nagain try milk--a spoonful only at a time: another attempt, he thinks,\r\nshould be made with porter, in some shape or other. Sweet oil,\r\nmolasses, and milk, in equal proportions, he has known to agree with\r\nstomachs which had rejected every thing else. Yet he says, and with\r\nshow of reason, that these things depend so much on the taste, the\r\nhabits of life, the peculiarity of constitution, that she and her\r\nattending physician can be the best, if not the only advisers. It\r\ngives me very great pleasure to learn that she is now better. I shall\r\nwrite you again on Sunday, having always much to say to you\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 13th January, 1794.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 9th, my dear Theo., was a most agreeable surprise\r\nto me. I had not dared even to hope for one until to-morrow. In one\r\ninstance, at least, an attempt to please me has not been\r\n\"unsuccessful.\" You see I do not forget that piece of impudence.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rush says that he cannot conceive animal food to be\r\nparticularly necessary; nourishment is the great object. He approves\r\nmuch of the milk punch and chocolate. The stomach must on no account\r\nbe offended. The intermission of the pills for a few days (not however\r\nfor a whole week) he thinks not amiss to aid in determining its\r\neffects. The quantity may yet be increased without danger, but the\r\npresent dose is in his opinion sufficient; but after some days\r\ncontinual use, a small increase might be useful.\r\n\r\nI was yesterday thronged with company from eight in the morning till\r\neleven at night. The Greek signature, though a little mistaken, was\r\nnot lost upon me. I have a letter from Mr. Leshlie, which pays you\r\nmany compliments. He has also ventured to promise that you will every\r\nday get a lesson in Terence by yourself. You know how grateful this\r\nwill be to\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 14th January, 1794.\r\n\r\nI really think, my dear Theo., that you will be very soon beyond all\r\nverbal criticism, and that my whole attention will be presently\r\ndirected to the improvement of your style. Your letter of the 9th is\r\nremarkably correct in point of spelling. That word rec_ie_ved still\r\nescapes your attention. Try again. The words _wold_ and _shold_ are\r\nmere carelessness; necess_e_ry instead of necess_a_ry, belongs, I\r\nsuspect to the same class.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. B. called here, but did not speak of his having rec_ie_ved a\r\nletter from you, but desired,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhen I copied the foregoing, I intended to have shown you how to\r\nimprove it; but, upon second thought, determine to leave it to\r\nyourself. Do me the favour to _endorse_ it on, or _subjoin_ it to,\r\nyour next letter, corrected and varied according to the best of your\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n\"Ma begs you will omit the thoughts of leaving Congress,\" &c.; \"omit\"\r\nis improperly used here. You mean \"_abandon, relinquish, renounce_, or\r\n_abjure_ the thoughts,\" &c. Your mamma, Mr. Leshlie, or your\r\ndictionary (Johnson's folio), will teach you the force of this\r\nobservation. The last of these words would have been too strong for\r\nthe occasion. You have used with _propriety_ the words \"encomium\" and\r\n\"adopted.\" I hope you may have frequent occasion for the former, with\r\nthe like application.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot be committed to paper,\" is well expressed.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 16th January, 1794.\r\n\r\nI hope the mercury, if tried, will be used with the most vigilant\r\ncaution and the most attentive observation of its first effects. I am\r\nextremely anxious and apprehensive about the event of such an\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nI fear, my dear little girl, that my letter of the 13th imposed too\r\nmuch upon you; if so, dispense with what you may find too troublesome.\r\nYou perceive by this license the entire confidence which I place in\r\nyour discretion.\r\n\r\nYour journal still advances towards perfection. But the letter which\r\naccompanied it is, I remark with regret, rather a falling off. I have\r\nreceived none more carelessly written, or with more numerous omissions\r\nof words. I am sensible that many apologies are at hand; but you,\r\nperhaps, would not be sensible that any were necessary, if I should\r\nomit to remind you.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday se'nnight (I think the 26th) I shall, unless baffled or\r\ndelayed by ice or weather, be with you at Richmond Hill. I will not\r\nbid you adieu till the Friday preceding. In the interim, we shall\r\noften in this way converse.\r\n\r\nI continue the practice of scoring words for our mutual improvement.\r\nThe use, as applicable to you, was indicated in a former letter.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will be charmed with the Greek language above all\r\nothers. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 23d January, 1794.\r\n\r\nIo, triumphe! There is not a word mispelled either in your journal or\r\nletter, which cannot be said of a single page you ever before wrote.\r\nThe fable is quite classical, and, if not very much corrected by Mr.\r\nLeshlie, is truly a surprising performance, and written most\r\nbeautifully. But what has become of poor Alpha Beta? Discouraged? That\r\nis impossible. Laid aside for the present? That, indeed, is possible,\r\nbut by no means probable. Shall I guess again? Yes; you mean to\r\nsurprise me with some astonishing progress. And yet, to confess the\r\ntruth, your lessons in Terence, Exercises, and \"music\" (without a _k_,\r\nobserve) seem to leave little time for any other study. I must remain\r\nin suspense for four days longer.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rush thinks that bark would not be amiss, but may be beneficial\r\nif the stomach does not rebuke it, which must be constantly the first\r\nobject of attention. He recommends either the cold infusion or\r\nsubstance as least likely to offend the stomach.\r\n\r\nBe able, upon my arrival, to tell me the difference between an\r\n_infusion_ and _decoction_; and the history, the virtues, and the\r\n_botanical_ or medical name of the bark. Chambers will tell you more\r\nperhaps than you will wish to read of it. Your little mercurial\r\ndisquisition is ingenious, and prettily told.\r\n\r\nI have a most dreary prospect of weather and roads for my journey. I\r\nset off on Saturday morning, and much fear that it will take two or\r\nthree days to get to Now-York.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 13th February, 1794.\r\n\r\nI received your letter and enclosures yesterday in Senate. I stopped\r\nreading the letter, and took up the story in the place you directed;\r\nwas really affected by the interesting little tale, faithfully\r\nbelieving it to have been taken from the Mag. D'Enf., and was\r\nastonished and delighted when I recurred to the letter and found the\r\nlittle deception you had played upon me. It is concisely and\r\nhandsomely told, and is indeed a performance above your years.\r\n\r\nMr. Leshlie is not, I am afraid, a competent judge of what you are\r\ncapable of learning; you must convince him that you can, when you set\r\nin earnest about it, accomplish wonders.\r\n\r\nDo you mean that the forty lines which you construed in Virgil were in\r\na part you had not before learned?\r\n\r\nI despair of getting genuine Tent wine in this city. There never was a\r\nbottle of real unadulterated Tent imported here for sale. Mr.\r\nJefferson, who had some for his own use, has left town. Good Burgundy\r\nand Muscat, mixed in equal parts, make a better Tent than can be\r\nbought. But by Bartow's return you shall have what I can get--sooner\r\nif I find a conveyance.\r\n\r\nBartow is the most perfect gossip I ever knew; though, I must say, it\r\nis the kind of life I have advised him to while he stays here. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 7th March, 1794.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 4th was three days on the road. I am certain that I\r\nhave answered punctually all which have come to hand. True, I have not\r\nwritten to you as frequently as during the first few weeks of my\r\nresidence here. For the last month I have been very much occupied by\r\npublic business. You will need no other proof of it when I tell you\r\nthat near twenty unanswered letters are now on my desk, not one of\r\nyours among them, however, except that received last evening. I have\r\nnot even been to the theatre except about an hour, and then it was\r\nmore an errand of business than amusement.\r\n\r\nPoor Tom, [3] I hope you take good care of him. If he is confined by\r\nhis leg, &c., he must pay the greater attention to his reading and\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nI shall run off to see you about Sunday or Monday; but the roads are\r\nso extremely bad that I expect to be three days getting through. I\r\nwill bring with me the cherry sweetmeats, and something for _Augusta\r\nLouisa Matilda Theodosia Van Horne_. I believe I have not recollected\r\nall her names.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 31st March, 1794.\r\n\r\nI am distressed at your loss of time. I do not, indeed, wholly blame\r\nyou for it, but this does not diminish my regret. When you want\r\npunctuality in your letters, I am sure you want it in every thing; for\r\nyou will constantly observe that you have the most leisure when you do\r\nthe most business. Negligence of one's duty produces a\r\nself-dissatisfaction which unfits the mind for every thing, and\r\n_ennui_ and peevishness are the never-failing consequences. You will\r\nreadily discover the truth of these remarks by reflecting on your own\r\nconduct, and the different feelings which have flowed from a\r\npersevering attention to study, or a restless neglect of it.\r\n\r\nI shall in a few days (this week) send you a most beautiful assortment\r\nof flower-seeds and flowering shrubs. If I do not receive a letter\r\nfrom you to-morrow, I shall be out of all patience. Every day's\r\njournal will, I hope, say something of mamma.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 7th June, 1794.\r\n\r\nI have received my dear Theo.'s two little, very little, French\r\nletters. The last left you tormented with headache and toothache, too\r\nmuch for one poor little girl to suffer at one time, I am sure: you\r\nhad doubtless taken solue sudden cold. You must fight them as well as\r\nyou can till I come, and then I will engage to keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nI remark that you do not acknowledge the receipt of a long letter\r\nwhich I wrote you on the road the night after I left New-York. I hope\r\nit has not missed you; but it is needless now to ask about it, for I\r\nshall certainly see you before I could receive your answer to this.\r\n\r\nWhatever you shall translate of Terence, I beg you to have copied in a\r\nbook in a very fair handwriting.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 4th August, 1794.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR THEO.,\r\n\r\nWe arrived here yesterday, after a hot, tedious passage of _seven\r\ndays_. We were delayed as well by accidents as by calms and contrary\r\nwinds, The first evening, being under full sail, we ran ashore at\r\nTappan, and lay there aground, in a very uncomfortable situation,\r\ntwenty-four hours. With great labour and fatigue we got off on the\r\nfollowing night, and had scarce got under sail before we missed our\r\nlongboat. We lost the whole tide in hunting for it, and so lay till\r\nthe morning of Wednesday. Having then made sail again, with a pretty\r\nstrong head wind, at the very first tack the Dutch horse fell\r\noverboard. The poor devil was at the time tied about the neck with a\r\nrope, so that he seemed to have only the alternatives of hanging or\r\ndrowning (for the river is here about four miles wide, and the water\r\nwas very rough); fortunately for him, the rope broke, and he went\r\nsouse into the water. His weight sunk him so deep that we were at\r\nleast fifty yards from him before he came up. He snorted off the\r\nwater, and turning round once or twice, as if to see where he was,\r\nthen recollecting the way to New-York, he immediately swam off down\r\nthe river with all force. We fitted out our longboat in pursuit of\r\nhim, and at length drove him on shore on the Westchester side, where I\r\nhired a man to take him to Frederick's. All this delayed us nearly a\r\nwhole tide more. The residue of the voyage was without accident,\r\nexcept such as you may picture to yourself in a small cabin, with\r\nseven men, seven women, and two crying children--two of the women\r\nbeing the most splenetic, ill-humoured animals you can imagine.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival here I was delighted to receive your letter of the 30th,\r\nwith the journal of that and the preceding days. Your history of those\r\nthree days is very full and satisfactory, and has induced me, by way\r\nof return, to enlarge on the particulars of my journey. I am quite\r\ngratified that you have secured Mrs. Penn's (observe how it is\r\nspelled) good opinion, and content with your reasons for not saying\r\nthe civil things you intended. In case you should dine in company with\r\nher, I will apprize you of one circumstance, by a trifling attention\r\nto which you may elevate yourself in her esteem. She is a great\r\nadvocate for a very plain, rather abstemious diet in children, as you\r\nmay see by her conduct with Miss Elizabeth. Be careful, therefore, to\r\neat of but one dish; that a plain roast or boiled: little or no gravy\r\nor butter, and very sparingly of dessert or fruit: not more than half\r\na glass of wine; and if more of any thing to eat or drink is offered,\r\ndecline it. If they ask a reason--Papa thinks it not good for me, is\r\nthe best that can be given.\r\n\r\nIt was with great pain and reluctance that I made this journey without\r\nyou. But your manners are not yet quite sufficiently formed to enable\r\nyou to do justice to your own character, [4] and the expectations\r\nwhich are formed of you, or to my wishes. Improve, therefore, to the\r\nutmost the present opportunity; inquire of every point of behaviour\r\nabout which you are embarrassed; imitate as much as you can the\r\nmanners of Madame De S., and observe also every thing which Mrs. Penn\r\nsays and does.\r\n\r\nYou should direct your own breakfast. Send Cesar every morning for a\r\npint of milk for you; and, to save trouble to Madame De S., let her\r\nknow that you eat at breakfast only bread and butter.\r\n\r\nI wish you would read over your letters after you have written them;\r\nfor so many words are omitted, that in some places I cannot make out\r\nthe sense, _if any they contain_. Make your figures or ciphers in your\r\nletters, but write out the numbers at length, except dates. Adieu,\r\naffectionately adieu,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 14th August, 17 94.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR THEO.,\r\n\r\nLast evening's mail brought me your letter and journal from the 1st to\r\nthe 11th of August, according to your dates, which, however, are\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe account of your time is very satisfactory. You really get along\r\nmuch better than I expected, which is infinitely to the credit of your\r\ngood sense, that being your only guide. From the attentions you\r\nreceive from Mrs. Penn and her family, I judge you have been so\r\nfortunate as to gain her esteem, and that her prejudices are turned\r\ninto prepossessions, which I assure you gratified me not a little.\r\n\r\nYour invitation to the Z.'s was, I confess, a very embarrassing\r\ndilemma, and one from which it was not easy to extricate yourself. For\r\nthe future, take it as your rule to visit only the families which you\r\nhave known me to visit; and if Madame De S. should propose to you to\r\nvisit any other, you may tell her what are my instructions on the\r\nsubject. To the young ladies, you may pretend business or engagements:\r\navoid, however, giving any offence to your companions. It is the\r\nmanner of a refusal, much more than the refusal, which gives offence.\r\nThis direction about your visits applies only to the citizens or\r\nEnglish families. You may, indeed it is my wish, that you should visit\r\nwith Madame De S. all her French acquaintance.\r\n\r\nI go this afternoon to attend a court at Ballston, and shall, on\r\nMonday, attend one at Troy, which will probably last about three days;\r\nafter which I shall take passage for New-York, proposing, however, to\r\npass a day at Kingston, and another at Poughkeepsie, with citizen\r\nHauterieve, so that I may be expected home some time in the week after\r\nnext; but you will hear often from me before that time. You must not\r\nsend me any letter after those which will come by the mail leaving\r\nNew-York on Monday next; yet you must continue your letters and\r\njournal as usual, for my amusement on my return.\r\n\r\nIn future, write no more on the little paper, but let the letters and\r\njournal be together on paper of this size, or common letter-paper. Set\r\napart every day half an hour or an hour to write to me, and I must\r\nagain entreat you to write at least legibly: after great pains, I am\r\nwholly unable to decipher some of the hieroglyphics contained in your\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nFour pages in Lucian was a great lesson; and why, my dear Theo., can't\r\nthis be done a little oftener? You must, by this time, I think, have\r\ngone through Lucian. I wish you to begin and go through it again; for\r\nit would be shameful to pretend to have read a book of which you could\r\nnot construe a page. At the second reading you will, I suppose, be\r\nable to double your lessons; so that you may go through it in three\r\nweeks. You say nothing of writing or learning Greek verbs;--is this\r\npractice discontinued? and why?\r\n\r\nI wish you to go oftener to the house. You may, if you like, go any\r\nmorning, to take an early breakfast there, giving notice the day\r\nbefore to Mr. Leshlie, that he may attend at the hour of your return,\r\nwhen I know you can readily make up the lost time.\r\n\r\nDo you continue to preserve Madame De S.'s good opinion of your\r\ntalents for the harp? And do you find that you converse with more\r\nfacility in the French? These are interesting questions, and your\r\nanswer to this will, I hope, answer fully, all the questions it\r\ncontains. Vale, vale.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA,\r\n\r\nAlbany, 16th August, 1704.\r\n\r\nAnother post has arrived, and brought me no letter from you. It is the\r\nlast omission which I shall readily pardon, and this only in\r\nconsideration of your not having then received my last. I returned\r\nthis day from Ballston, and my principal business to this city was to\r\nreceive and answer your letters. Judge, therefore, of my\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Witbeck made many inquiries about you, and appeared much\r\nmortified that you did not accompany me.\r\n\r\nI hope you will, before this can reach you, have answered J. Yates's\r\nletter. Once more I place my expectations on the arrival of the next\r\npost.\r\n\r\nLet me know whether Mrs. Penn has left town, how often you have been\r\nwith her, and what passed. I need not repeat my anxiety to know how\r\nyou and Madame de S. agree, and what progress you make in music,\r\ndancing, and speaking French. She promised to give you now and then a\r\nlesson on the forte-piano; is she as good as her word?\r\n\r\nHaving failed in your promise to write by every post, you cannot\r\nexpect me to return within the month--one promise being founded on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 18th August, 1794.\r\n\r\nYesterday I received your letter and journal to the 13th inclusive. On\r\nthe 13th you say you got nine pages in Lucian. It was, to be sure, a\r\nmost surprising lesson. I suspect it must have been the second time\r\ngoing over; and even then it would have been great, and at the same\r\nrate you will be through a second time before my month is up. I should\r\nbe delighted to find it so. I have not told you directly that I should\r\nstay longer than a month, but I was angry enough with you to stay\r\nthree months when you neglected to write to me for two successive\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to see so many blank days with Mr. Leshlie. If he is\r\nnot at your room within a quarter of an hour of his time, Cesar should\r\nbe forthwith sent off express for him. Let Cesar, therefore, call on\r\nyou every morning at the hour Mr. Leshlie ought to come.\r\n\r\nI left New-York on the 28th of July. My month, therefore, will expire\r\non the 28th of August, so that you cannot complain until that day is\r\npast. The court at Troy will probably detain me the whole of this\r\nweek, which is three days longer than I expected.\r\n\r\nI long to hear what you contributed towards Madame de S.'s _jour de\r\nfête_. No letter yet for John Yates. Why do you delay it so long? You\r\nhave had several leisure days; for this delay there should be some\r\napology in your letter.\r\n\r\nAffectionately your papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nTroy, 21st August, 1794.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR THEO.,\r\n\r\nI sent Alexis in the rain to Albany for your letter of the 18th and\r\njournal, which he has just brought me. Your letters are my only\r\nconsolation during this afflicting absence--for it is to me a real\r\naffliction. I have forborne to express to you my impatience, lest it\r\nshould increase yours.\r\n\r\nThe business I have undertaken here will, contrary to all expectation,\r\ndetain me till Saturday night. I hope to be on my return on Monday,\r\nwhen you must begin to pray for northerly winds; or, if you have\r\nlearned, to say mass, that the French Roman Catholics rely on to\r\nprocure them all earthly and spiritual blessings. By-the-by, if you\r\nhave not been to the Roman chapel, I insist that you go next Sunday,\r\nif you are not engaged in some other party.\r\n\r\nI am very happy to receive a letter for John Yates. I shall send it to\r\nhim to-day; it is very handsome, and will please him much. I will\r\nindeed return with all possible speed. Continue your journal. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 21st December, 1794.\r\n\r\nI obeyed faithfully the command in your letter which bade me read the\r\njournal first, and I read it with great eagerness, hoping to find what\r\nI did find in the last sentence. That 16th was really a surprising\r\nday. Three hundred and ninety-five lines, all your exercises, and all\r\nyour music. Go on, my dear girl, and you will become all that I wish.\r\n\r\nI keep carefully your letters and journals, and when we meet you shall\r\nread them again, which I am sure you will do with pleasure. It is\r\nalways delightful to see and correct our own errors.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Maupertuis is highly mortified that you should suppose him so\r\nignorant as to have lost himself on the road. It seems he only went a\r\nlittle off the highway _from curiosity to see the country_.\r\n\r\nI hope you like Terence. Can't you lug a scrap from him now and then,\r\napropos, into your letters? It will please\r\n\r\nYour affectionate papa,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 5th January, 1795.\r\n\r\nYou see me safe arrived in New-York. I have passed but one hour at\r\nRichmond Hill. It seems solitary and undesirable without you. They are\r\nall well, and much, very much disappointed that you did not come with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nPray write to Mrs. A., if but one line; she expects and deserves it. I\r\nwas there last evening for the first time. Your picture is really like\r\nyou; still it does not quite please me. It has a _pensive,\r\nsentimental_ air; that of a love-sick maid! Stewart has probably meant\r\nto anticipate what you may be at sixteen; but even in that I think he\r\nhas missed it.\r\n\r\nBartow has grown immensely fat. Mrs. A. has recovered and walks about.\r\nThere has been a serious attempt to institute masquerade. It has not\r\nsucceeded, nor is it yet abandoned.\r\n\r\nWe (you and I) have both neglected one duty of civility. Some weeks\r\nago Mrs. Jackson was polite enough to call on you, with Miss Jackson\r\nand Miss Brown, who left you cards. You have never returned the visit.\r\nI beg you to do it without delay. Doctor Edwards will probably make\r\ntime to go with you for a few minutes. It is at Doctor Jackson's in\r\nThird-street, between High and Arch.\r\n\r\nOur house in Partition-street is very neatly finished, and pleases me\r\nmuch; so much that I propose to inhabit it upon our return from\r\nPhiladelphia, at least until the hot weather.\r\n\r\nYou are now in the arms of Somnus, or ought to be; for though I date\r\nmy letter the 5th, it is in truth about half past eleven at night of\r\nthe 4th. So wants half an hour of the 5th. Dream on. _Salutem_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nBristol, 14th September, 1795.\r\n\r\nSaturday night I lodged at Elizabethtown, and, after two wettings,\r\ndined on Sunday with General Freelinghuysen. Madame (late Miss Yard)\r\nasked much after you, as did Maria, the general's daughter. The family\r\nis a picture of cheerfullness and happiness. At Princeton (to-day) I\r\nmet Le Mercier, who is well, except a broken scull, a face disfigured,\r\nand some bruises about the ribs--considerable deductions, you will\r\nsay, from the \"corpore sano.\" They are the effects of a very huge\r\nbeating bestowed on him (gratis) by two gentlemen of the town. He had\r\nsome difference with one of them, who had challenged him, which Le\r\nMercier refused, not being a Christian-like and clerical way of\r\nsettling differences. So the challenger, with a friend (for L. M.\r\ncould have thrashed him singly), took an opportunity to catch poor Le\r\nMercier alone, and discussed the subject with him in the manner above\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nYour friends Miss Stockton and Miss Smith said some civil things about\r\nyou, and send abundance of love, which I promised them I would forget\r\nto deliver.\r\n\r\nMy journey thus far has been wonderfully fortunate, having only\r\noverset once and broken down once, which, considering that I am\r\nseventy miles on my route, is, for me, a very small list of\r\ngrievances; but I shall count it full measure if I am prevented from\r\nentering Philadelphia to-morrow, which is a little to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nYou must pay off Meance and Hewlet for their attendance on you and\r\nNatalie. [5] They must be paid regularly at the end of each month. I\r\nforgot it. Get their accounts, and give them an order on Strong for\r\nthe amount. When either of you want money, Roger Strong will furnish\r\nit. Pray settle also your account with Madame Senat, and write me that\r\nthese things are done.\r\n\r\nTell Mr. Martel that I request that all the time he can spare you be\r\ndevoted to Latin; that I have provided you with a teacher of French,\r\nthat no part of his attention might be taken off. I will send from\r\nPhiladelphia the certificate he requested, which escaped my memory\r\nwhile at New-York.\r\n\r\nI fear it will puzzle you all to decipher this. You may show to Mr.\r\nMartel the clause which relates to him. Salutem, chère Theodosia.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 17th September, 1795.\r\n\r\nBy this post I received a letter from Colonel Ward, requesting leave\r\nto remove his family into my house, Richmond Hill. He lives, you may\r\nrecollect, in the part of the town which is said to be sickly. I could\r\nnot therefore refuse. He will call on you to go out with him. You had\r\nbetter, immediately on receipt of this, go out yourself, and apprize\r\nAnthony and Peggy.\r\n\r\nYour letter to Kersaint is much to the purpose. It came by this day's\r\nmail, though put in the postoffice on Tuesday, but after the closing\r\nof the mail. With it I have also received your letter, written, I\r\nsuppose, on Tuesday evening, because it speaks of the circus; but, as\r\nusual, without date. I beg that, when you sit down to write a letter,\r\nyou will begin by putting a date at the top; this will then presently\r\nbecome a habit, and will never be omitted.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, very sorry that you are obliged to submit to some reproof.\r\nIndeed, I fear that your want of attention and politeness, and your\r\nawkward postures, require it. As you appear desirous to get rid of\r\nthese bad habits, I hope you will soon afford no room for ill-nature\r\nitself to find fault with you--I mean in these particulars; for as to\r\nwhat regards your heart and your motives of action, I know them to be\r\ngood, amiable, and pure. But to return to the subject of manners, &c.\r\nI have often seen Madame at table, and other situations, pay you the\r\nutmost attention; offer you twenty civilities, while you appeared\r\nscarcely sensible that she was speaking to you; or, at the most,\r\nreplied with a cold _remercie_, without even a look of satisfaction or\r\ncomplacency. A moment's reflection will convince you that this conduct\r\nwill be naturally construed into arrogance; as if you thought that all\r\nattention was _due_ to you, and as if you felt above showing the least\r\nto anybody. I know that you abhor such sentiments, and that you are\r\nincapable of being actuated by them. Yet you expose yourself to the\r\ncensure without intending or knowing it. I believe you will in future\r\navoid it. Observe how Natalie replies to the smallest civility which\r\nis offered to her.\r\n\r\nYour habit of stooping and bringing your shoulders forward on to your\r\nbreast not only disfigures you, but is alarming on account of the\r\ninjury to your health. The continuance in this vile habit will\r\ncertainly produce a consumption: then farewell papa; farewell\r\npleasure; farewell life! This is no exaggeration; no fiction to excite\r\nyour apprehensions. But, setting aside this distressing consideration,\r\nI am astonished that you have no more pride in your appearance. You\r\nwill certainly stint your growth and disfigure your person.\r\n\r\nReceive with calmness every reproof, whether made kindly or unkindly;\r\nwhether just or unjust. Consider within yourself whether there has\r\nbeen no cause for it. If it has been groundless and unjust,\r\nnevertheless bear it with composure, and even with complacency.\r\nRemember that one in the situation of Madame has a thousand things to\r\nfret the temper; and you know that one out of humour, for any cause\r\nwhatever, is apt to vent it on every person that happens to be in the\r\nway. We must learn to bear these things; and, let me tell you, that\r\nyou will always feel much better, much happier, for having borne with\r\nserenity the spleen of any one, than if you had returned spleen for\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am sure, my dear Theodosia, pardon two such grave pages\r\nfrom one who loves you, and whose happiness depends very much on\r\nyours. Read it over twice. Make me no promises on the subject. On my\r\nreturn, I shall see in half an hour whether what I have written has\r\nbeen well or ill received. If well, it will have produced an effect. I\r\nhave sent Alexis with your letter to Kersaint while I write this.\r\nAfter closing of the mail I shall present myself. To-morrow morning I\r\ntake stage for Baltimore; thence to Washington, &c. You shall\r\ncertainly hear often from me. You have not yet acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of my letter from Bristol. R. Strong has received his, written\r\nat the same time. Having many letters to answer by this mail, I cannot\r\nadd any thing sprightly to this dull letter. One dull thing you will\r\nhear me repeat without disgust, that I am your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington, 23d September, 1795.\r\n\r\nI write from the house of our friends, Law and Duncanson, where I make\r\nmy home. Miss Duncanson, who is mistress of the house, is a very\r\nsprightly, sensible, ladylike woman. My remarks on this city are\r\nreserved till we meet.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 17th, and one without date (I suppose the 18th),\r\ncame in this evening. They contain more wit and sprightliness than you\r\never wrote in the same compass, and have amused me exceedingly. But\r\nwhy do you diminish their value by carelessness? There is an omission\r\nof one or more words in almost every sentence. At least I entreat you\r\nto read over your letters before you seal them: some clauses are\r\nabsolutely unintelligible, though in several I can guess what word you\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nWhy are you still in town? I am very much dissatisfied with it; for\r\nMr. Strong writes me that the fever is in Partition-street. I beg you\r\nto go off with a good parcel of books to Frederick's.\r\n\r\nI told Madame Senat that I should want the two front rooms in\r\nPartition-street, and the very small room which adjoins the smallest\r\nof the front rooms; and surely she will have room enough without it.\r\nTry to arrange this so; that is, by asking her if she cannot spare\r\nthat room (the large front). Mr. Strong writes me that she is taking\r\npossession of it. In that case my papers will be moved, which will be\r\nvery disagreeable to me.\r\n\r\nI fix the 24th of October for my return; if any very extraordinary\r\nthing should detain me, you shall be advised of it seasonably. Direct\r\nto me at the city of Washington until the 10th of October. Tell R.\r\nStrong the same. I forgot to write it to him.\r\n\r\nWhen, you go on any party from Pelham, to Brown's Mrs. Cox's, &c.,\r\nyour studies may be intermitted. At least as much of them as may be\r\nnecessary. I am tired, and half sick; a great cold, for which I shall\r\nlie by here tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThine,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington,\r\n\r\n26th September, 1795.\r\n\r\nSince Tuesday last I have been here much against my will; arrested by\r\nhigh command; performing quarantine by authority not to be questioned\r\nor controverted. In plain English, I am sick. On Wednesday I found one\r\nside of my face as large as your uncle F.'s; red swollen eyes; ears\r\nbuzzing and almost stopped; throat so closed as to refuse a passage to\r\nwords out or food in; and a stupid mazy-headedness, well adapted to\r\nthe brilliancy of my figure. Being the guest of my friends Law and\r\nDuncanson, I receive from them the most distressing attentions, but\r\nespecially from Miss Duncanson, a well-bred, sprightly, and agreeable\r\nwoman. My person had not, however, till this morning, received its\r\nlast embellishment. Alexis came in at his usual hour, and presenting\r\nhimself at my bedside, after staring at me for half a minute,\r\nexclaimed, with an air of great astonishment--_Diable!_ and not a word\r\nmore. _Qu'a-t-il_, Alexis? To which he made not a word of reply, but\r\nfell to drawing up the curtains; and having also very deliberately\r\nopened the window-shutters, he returned again to his examination.\r\nAfter gazing for some time (which I found it useless to interrupt), he\r\n_diabled_ two or three times at intervals of some seconds, and then\r\npronounced that I had _ou la petite vérole ou la rougeole_; and to\r\nconvince me, brought a glass. In truth he did not _diable_ without\r\nreason, for my whole face, neck, hands, and arms are most bountifully\r\ncovered with something like the measles or rash. All these pleasant\r\nappearances seem to be the effects of a great cold, taken I know not\r\nwhen or how--\r\n\r\n\"_Nil illi larva aut tragicis upus esse cothurnis._\"\r\n\r\nMy throat is something better, notwithstanding I went abroad\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nSunday, 27th September.\r\n\r\nI am so much better to-day, that, if the weather was good, I should\r\nprosecute my journey if I could find the means of getting on; but the\r\nrain, which is continual and very heavy, keeps well and sick within\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nIt is now ten days since I have heard from you; a very long time,\r\nconsidering the situation in which you was left at the date of your\r\nlast: in a city infected with a mortal and contagious fever. I hope,\r\nnay, I persuade myself that you obeyed my wishes by escaping from it\r\nto Pelham. The next mail will tell me, and, I trust, relieve me from\r\nan anxiety which pursues me day and night.\r\n\r\nMonday, 28th September.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 21st, written, I suppose, at Dr. Brown's, is just\r\ncome in, and relieves me from a weight of anxiety about your health. I\r\nam sorry, however (very sorry), that you are not at Frederick's, and\r\nam not absolutely either pleased or satisfied with the change.\r\n\r\nOf attention and tenderness you will receive not only enough, but a\r\ngreat deal too much; and an indulgence to every inattention, awkward\r\nhabit, and expression, which may lead you to imagine them to be so\r\nmany ornaments: as to your language, I shall expect to find it\r\nperfectly infantine. As to studies or lessons, I do not know which of\r\nthem you allude to, as you do not say what books you have taken up. If\r\nMr. Leshlie is your _only_ master, as I suppose, your lesson must be\r\nlarger than ever heretofore. Your translation of the comedy into\r\nFrench, if not finished, must go on; and if finished, something\r\nsimilar must be taken up. Some English or French history must employ a\r\nlittle of every day. I hope you will ride on horseback daily if the\r\nweather should permit--Sam [6] always with you. Visit your neighbours\r\nB. B. as often as you please, taking very great care not to surfeit\r\nthe family with your charming company, which may happen much sooner\r\nthan you would be inclined to believe.\r\n\r\nYou ought to be out of the Odyssey before this will reach you,\r\ncounting only two hundred lines a day since we parted. You may begin\r\nthe Iliad, if you please. Since you are at uncle B.'s, I will not now\r\npretend to inquire into the motives, much less to censure. I have no\r\ndoubt but you meant to do the best, and I now hope you will endeavour\r\nto make the best _of_ it, and bad enough that will be, with respect to\r\nall improvement, if I am not disappointed.\r\n\r\nPray allot an hour for your journal, and never let it be a day in\r\narrear. I shall consider this as occupying usefully the hour which\r\nused to be Hewlet's or Meance's. At any rate, let me not, on my\r\nreturn, have occasion to apply to you the motto,\r\n\r\n\"Strenua me exercet inertia,\"\r\n\r\nnor that other of\r\n\r\n\"Operose nihil agit.\"\r\n\r\nBut so improve your time that you may with pleasure review and commit\r\nit to journal.\r\n\r\n----\"Hoc est, Vivere bis, vitâ priori frui.\"\r\n\r\nAnd let it, at no very distant period, be said of you,\r\n\r\n\"Tot, tibi, sunt, ergo dotes, quot sidera coelo.\"\r\n\r\nIf you should never deserve this, it shall not be the fault of\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 8th February, 1796.\r\n\r\nWhat will you think of the taste of New-York when I shall tell you\r\nthat Miss Broadhurst is not very generally admired here? Such is the\r\nfact. I have contributed my feeble efforts to correct this opinion.\r\nMat's [7] child will not be christened until you shall be pleased to\r\nindicate the time, place, manner, and name.\r\n\r\nI have promised Tom that he shall take me to Philadelphia if there be\r\nsleighing. The poor fellow is almost crazy about it. He is importuning\r\nall the gods for snow, but as yet they don't appear to listen to him.\r\n\r\nYour being in the ballette charms me. If you are to practise on\r\nWednesday evening, do not stay away for the expectation of receiving\r\nme. If you should be at the ballette, I will go forthwith to see you.\r\nAdieu, chère fille.\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 16th January, 1797.\r\n\r\nWhen I write to you oftener than your turn, you must not let it be\r\nknown, or there will be jealousy. Your two letters of the 11th and\r\n13th have so much wit, sprightliness, and good sense, that I cannot\r\ndelay to tell you how much they pleased me. Go on, and you will write\r\nbetter than Cynthia herself. To aid your advances towards perfection,\r\nI shall often point out such errors as shall appear to me more\r\nparticularly to claim your attention.\r\n\r\nAt present you fail most in punctuation. A very little thought will\r\nteach where the sense is complete and a full period is proper. The\r\nlesser pauses may be found by reading over two or three times what you\r\nmay have written. You will naturally make small pauses where the sense\r\nshall require it. In spelling you are very well. Always write your\r\nname with great care. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 23d January, 1797.\r\n\r\nYou must not \"puzzle all day,\" my dear little girl, at one hard\r\nlesson. After puzzling faithfully one hour, apply to your arithmetic,\r\nand do enough to convince the doctor that you have not been idle.\r\nNeither must you be discouraged by one unlucky day. The doctor is a\r\nvery reasonable man, and makes all due allowance for the levities as\r\nwell as for the stupidity of children. I think you will not often\r\nchallenge his indulgence on either score.\r\n\r\nAnd do you regret that you are not also a woman? That you are not\r\nnumbered in that galaxy of beauty which adorns an assembly-room?\r\nCoquetting for admiration and attracting flattery? No. I answer with\r\nconfidence. You feel that you are maturing for solid friendship. The\r\nfriends you gain you will never lose; and no one, I think, will dare\r\nto insult your understanding by such compliments as are most\r\ngraciously received by too many of your sex.\r\n\r\nHow unpardonably you neglect C. and N. B. Where are the promised\r\nletters? I see with delight that you improve in diction, and in the\r\ncombination and arrangement of your little ideas. With a view to\r\nfarther improvement, your letters to me are a most useful exercise. I\r\nfeel persuaded that all my hopes and wishes concerning you will be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nNever use a word which does not fully express your thoughts, or which,\r\nfor any other reason, does not please you. Hunt your dictionary till\r\nyou find one. Arrange a whole sentence in your mind before you write a\r\nword of it; and, whatever may be your \"hurry\" (never be in a _hurry_),\r\nread over your letter slowly and carefully before you seal it.\r\nInterline and erase lightly with your pen what may appear to you to\r\nrequire amendment or correction. I dispense with your copying unless\r\nthe letter should be much defaced, in which case keep it till the next\r\nmail. Copy and improve it.\r\n\r\nYour play on \"Light\" is pretty and witty, and the turn on the _dear\r\nlittle_ letter does not dishonour the metempsychosis of Madame Dacier.\r\n\r\nI shall probably see you very soon; we will then rearrange your hours,\r\nand endeavour to remove the present and forestall all future troubles.\r\nI should be mortified--I should be almost offended--if I should find\r\nthat you passed over any word in my letters without becoming perfectly\r\nacquainted with its meaning, use, and _etymology_.\r\n\r\nSince I commenced this letter, yours of the 21st has come in. It\r\nspeaks of another which has not come, and of Martel's paper, neither\r\nof which have come. This arises from \"hurry.\" The note to Mr.\r\nLivingston is middling. Affectionately--no, you hate that word;\r\nperhaps every thing is implied in plain.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 4th January, 1799.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday I arrived here, and yesterday received your two letters of\r\nthe 29th and 30th of December. Your despondency distresses me\r\nextremely. It is indeed unfortunate, my dear Theodosia, that we are\r\nconstrained to be separated. I had never so much need of your society\r\nand friendship, nor you, perhaps, of mine. It is a misfortune which I\r\nsincerely regret every hour of the day. It is one, however, which you\r\nmust aid me to support, by testifying that you can support your share\r\nof it with firmness and activity. An effort made with decision will\r\nconvince you that you are able to accomplish all I wish and all you\r\ndesire. Determination and perseverance in every laudable undertaking\r\nis the great point of difference between the silly and the wise. It is\r\nessentially a part of your character, and requires but an effort to\r\nbring it into action. The happiness of my life depends on your\r\nexertions; for what else, for whom else do I live? Not that the\r\nacquisition of the languages alone can decide your happiness or mine;\r\nbut if you should abandon the attempt, or despair of success, or relax\r\nyour endeavours, it would indicate a feebleness of character which\r\nwould dishearten me exceedingly. It is for my sake that you now\r\nlabour. I shall acknowledge your advancement with gratitude and with\r\nthe most lively pleasure. Let me entreat you not to be discouraged. I\r\nknow you to be capable of much greater efforts than this will require.\r\nIf your young teacher, after a week's trial, should not suit you,\r\ndismiss him on any pretence without wounding his pride, and take the\r\nold Scotchman. Resolve to succeed, and you cannot fail.\r\n\r\nI parted with you amid so much hurry and confusion, and so many\r\nvexations, that, when I had time to reflect, I seemed to have said\r\nnone of the things which I had wished and intended. I reproached\r\nmyself perpetually that I had not urged you to attend me. Your letters\r\nalmost confirmed me in the design of returning to fetch you; and yet\r\nmore sober reason seems to tell me that these things were rather the\r\neffusions of sentiment than of a deliberate estimate of your real\r\ninterests. In six weeks, however, we shall meet.\r\n\r\nI intended to have recommended to you the ancient and modern history\r\nof Millot. Natalie has some of the volumes--some are in the library at\r\nMrs. D.'s, of which I hope you keep the key. Millot is concise,\r\nperspicuous, and well selected. Rollin is full of tedious details and\r\nsuperstitious nonsense.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more certain than that you may form what countenance\r\nyou please. An open, serene, intelligent countenance, a little\r\nbrightened by cheerfullness, not wrought into smiles or simpers, will\r\npresently become familiar and grow into habit. A year will with\r\ncertainty accomplish it. Your physiognomy has naturally much of\r\nbenevolence, and it will cost you some labour (which you may well\r\nspare) to eradicate it. Avoid, for ever avoid, a smile or sneer of\r\ncontempt; never even mimic them. A frown of sullenness or discontent\r\nis but one degree less hateful. You seem to require these things of\r\nme, or I should have thought them unnecessary. I see, with pleasure I\r\nsee, that you have engaged in this matter. We shall both be gratified\r\nby the result, which cannot fail to accord with our wishes.\r\n\r\nR. has a deal of godly coquetry. It makes a strange medley. I was most\r\nhospitably received, and full opportunity given with pretty apparent\r\ndesign. R. has promised to be in Albany in a month. Things are in\r\n_statu quo_.\r\n\r\nI am unsettled, and at present at Witbeck's. One would think that the\r\ntown was going into mourning for your absence. I am perpetually\r\nstopped in the streets by little and big girls. Where is Miss Burr?\r\nWon't she come up this winter? Oh, why didn't you bring her? &c.\r\n\r\nJ. B. P. arrived yesterday, he has not given me a letter, or any other\r\nthing from you. He suspects, however, that he has at least a letter; a\r\nfact which he will endeavour to ascertain in the course of this week.\r\nI wrote you two letters on my way up, addressed to 135\r\nGreenwich-street. Is that right? Adieu, chère amie,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 11th February, 1799.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 9th, I received Your two letters, from the 1st to the\r\n6th inclusive; the last of which is the only one that has come in due\r\nseason, or in what is termed the course of post. You now see that a\r\nletter can come from New-York in three days; a truth which has been\r\nfrequently verified by the receipt of my letters, but never before by\r\nthe despatch of your own.\r\n\r\nHow very perverse and provoking you are about your correspondence with\r\nMr. Martin. I told you expressly that he was not angry, but, on the\r\ncontrary, that he sent it laughingly and as a good joke. Pray, from\r\nwhom did you learn that he was angry? You charge me with not noticing\r\ntwo of your letters, and that I have not given you any directions\r\nabout heedlessness. With submission, miss, you are mistaken. It is\r\ntrue that I have not repeated the word, but I have intimated several\r\nthings intended to this point. You expected, I presume, that I should\r\ntreat the subject scientifically, as Duport does his art, and begin by\r\nexplanation of terms, and then proceed to divide and subdivide the\r\nmatter, as a priest does a sermon. Such a dose would, I am sure, have\r\nsickened you. I have therefore thought it best to give you very little\r\nat a time, and watch, as physicians do with potent medicines, the\r\neffect produced. When we meet, which I verily believe will be in five\r\nor six days after the receipt of this, you shall have as much as I\r\nshall find your stomach will bear.\r\n\r\nWhat the deuse can have got into Madame S. and N., I am utterly at a\r\nloss to conjecture, and beg you not to give the remotest hint, but\r\nmeet them as usual.\r\n\r\nMy overtures to B. Livingston and Mr. and Mrs. R. were mere\r\nvolunteers, not produced by any thing you said or wrote; but I thought\r\nit might tend to produce a certain effect in your favour. So you have\r\nno apologies to make or pardons to ask on this subject. As this,\r\nhowever, is much the best composed part of your letter, I am\r\nparticularly obliged to you for it, even if you did it to display your\r\neloquence. It is, indeed, very happily expressed.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have emerged from your lethargy, which, I must confess,\r\nwas obvious to an alarming degree in several preceding letters. I\r\ncongratulate you upon it, and hope you will never suffer it again to\r\ninvade your faculties.\r\n\r\nWe will talk of houses, &c. about the 19th inst. Henry Walton has gone\r\nto New-York by the last stage. He is one of those whose good opinion\r\nand esteem I wish you to acquire. He has delicacy, taste, and\r\nrefinement--very, very rare qualities in this country at this day. He\r\nwill be often at your house; receive him with courtesy.\r\n\r\nI go to bed between 12 and 1, and rise between 7 and 8. For some\r\nreasons to me unknown, I cannot drink a single glass of wine without\r\nserious injury; still less can I bear ardent spirits; of course, I am\r\npretty much in the bread and water line; this is the more provoking,\r\nas I dine out almost every day, and the dinners are really excellent\r\nand well-dressed, not exceeded in New-York. I have dined at home but\r\nfour days since my arrival in this city. Think of that Miss B., and be\r\nhush about hospitality, &c.\r\n\r\nYour name to one letter is beautifully written; to the other, _la la_.\r\nThe handwriting of the letters various; very good, very bad, and\r\nmiddling; emblematic, shall I say, of the fair authoress? Please to\r\nresolve me whether author is not of both genders, for I hate the\r\nappendix of _ess?_\r\n\r\nWhat novel of Miss Burney or D'Arblay is that in which the heroine\r\nbegins by an interesting account of little details on her début in\r\nLondon, and particularly of a ball where she met Lord Somebody and did\r\ntwenty ridiculous things? I want such a description of a ball from\r\nyou. Be pleased to read those first letters of the novel referred to,\r\nand take them for a model.\r\n\r\nYou don't say half enough about the long letter which I wrote you on\r\nSunday of the last week. Adieu, chére amie.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 26th January, 1800.\r\n\r\nWe arrived yesterday without accident. To-day I expected Alexis and\r\nJohn; but the stage has arrived without them, and without a line\r\nexplanatory of the cause of their delay.\r\n\r\nOn alighting from the stage yesterday, I found at the door of my\r\nintended lodgings a number of persons who were impatiently expecting\r\nmy arrival. I perceive that I shall be day and night engrossed by\r\nbusiness. If I should write to you less or less often than usual, you\r\nwill know the cause.\r\n\r\nThe ideas, of which you are the object, that daily pass through my\r\nmind, would, if committed to writing, fill an octavo volume; invent,\r\nthen, and teach me some mode of writing with the facility and rapidity\r\nthat we think, and you shall receive by every mail some hundred pages.\r\nBut to select from a thousand thoughts that which is best and most\r\nseasonable; of the variety of attitudes of which every object is\r\nsusceptible, to determine on that which is most suitable for the thing\r\nand the occasion; of all possible modes of expression and language, to\r\ndiscern the most appropriate, _hic labor, hoc opus est_. Yet have we\r\nboth known persons of a moderate grade of intellect who could write\r\nwhenever you would put a pen in their hands, and for any length of\r\ntime you might please, without one moment of reflection or\r\nembarrassment. Pray explain to me this phenomenon. All this I confess\r\nis not very applicable to you or to my present occupation, for I\r\ngenerally write you what first offers, without considering whether it\r\nbe the best; and if many obtrude themselves at once, I write you, as\r\nat present, of--_nothing_. Indeed, my dear Theodosia, I have many,\r\nmany moments of solicitude about you. Remember that occupation will\r\ninfallibly expel the fiend ennui, and that solitude is the bug-bear of\r\nfools. God bless and aid thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, 30th January, 1800.\r\n\r\nAt length John and Alexis have arrived; but what gratified me more,\r\nand what I looked for with much more impatience was, a letter. I\r\nselected yours from the number which they brought me. I was not\r\ndisappointed. It merits all the eagerness with which I had expected\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYou reflect, and that is a security for your conduct. Our most\r\nhumiliating errors proceed usually from inattention, and from that\r\nmental dissipation which we call heedlessness. You estimate your\r\nsituation with great truth. Many are surprised that I could repose in\r\nyou so great a trust as that of yourself; but I knew that you were\r\nequal to it, and I am not deceived.\r\n\r\nYou do right to stay much at home. It will scarcely be worth while to\r\ngo to V. P.'s. C. is excluded from all rule. I am quite oppressed with\r\nthe kindness and friendship of _b. b._ towards you. How fortunate you\r\nare in such a friend. If their invitations should be so frequent as to\r\ninterrupt your lessons, you will do well to refuse even them. There is\r\na measure to be observed in the acceptance of the good offices even of\r\nour best friends; and at your age, to prefer duty to pleasure when\r\nthey are in collision, is a degree of firmness rarely exhibited, and,\r\ntherefore, the more calculated to inspire respect. I perceive that I\r\nam not very explicit; but you will reflect and discern my meaning.\r\nMontesquieu said he wrote to make people think, and not to make them\r\nread--and why may not A. Br. Perhaps, however, there may be no\r\ncollisions; and then your good sense will teach you not to wear out\r\ngood-will.\r\n\r\nYou indicate a very pleasant mode in which you suppose I may make you\r\nhappy; but you do not estimate things rightly. What you imagine to be\r\nsymptoms of love are the mere effusions of politeness, added to\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\nI forget the plan we projected, but there can be no better one than\r\nthat of your last letter, to which, therefore, you may adhere, unless\r\nindeed you can invent a better.\r\n\r\nYou may tell C. that as she and I _are on ceremony_, I shall expect\r\nthe first letter. She knows well that the bare sight of her\r\nhandwriting would drive Le Guen and the parchments to the antipodes. I\r\ndo thank you for your constancy about the French ball. Do not be\r\nalarmed lest I expect too much. I know your force, and now feel\r\nassured that I shall have reason to be more than satisfied both with\r\nyour discretion and your attainments. I shall not again find time to\r\nwrite you two pages; so do not expect it. Nevertheless, you will\r\nengross much, very much of the thoughts and affections of\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1800, slavery existed in the State of New-York.\r\nColonel Burr, at different periods, was the owner of slaves. All those\r\nthat remained in his family for any length of time were taught to read\r\nand write. During his absence from home it was his practice to\r\ncorrespond with one or more of them. As a master, he was beloved. A\r\nfew letters are here given as specimens of this correspondence. They\r\nare copied _literally_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 3d December.\r\n\r\nHONOURED MASTER,\r\n\r\nI received your letter December 1st, and we are all happy to hear that\r\nyou are well. Harry has taken the chair to the coachmaker's, and has\r\ngave him directions according to your orders. I have asked James to\r\nwrite to you to know how the venison was to be done; but I will now\r\nhave it cured as you have ordered. The sashes of the windows were\r\nnailed down the day that you went away, and the ladder that you\r\nmention belongs to Mr. Halsey, and be has taken it away. All the\r\npapers that have any writing on is put into the drawers, and I will\r\ntake care of the ink that it does not freeze. Colonel Platt was here,\r\nand has taken the four red cases that was in the wine-room; and he\r\nasked me for a square box, and as you had not told me of it, I said\r\nthat I had never seen it. There is nothing in the stable; but don't\r\nknow what is in Sam's room, as he has locked the door. We are happy to\r\nhear that Sam, and George, and the horses are in good order, and all\r\nthe family gives their love to them.\r\n\r\nPEGGY GARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 17th December.\r\n\r\nHONOURED MASTER,\r\n\r\nI received your letter, and am happy to hear that you are in a good\r\nstate of health. Harry went to Mr. Alston's farm the day after I\r\nreceived the letter, and the man had gone away the 11th day of\r\nDecember. Stephen was not at home when he went there, and by what he\r\ncould understand there was a great difference between Daniel and\r\nStephen; and Harry says that for the time that he has been there he\r\nhad not neglected his work. But, master, I wish to beg a favour of\r\nyou; please to grant it. I have found there is a day-school, kept by\r\nan elderly man and his wife, near to our house, and if master is\r\nwilling that I should go to it for two months, I think it would be of\r\ngreat service to me, and at the same time I will not neglect my work\r\nin the house, if you please, sir.\r\n\r\nPEGGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 29th December.\r\n\r\nHONOURED MASTER,\r\n\r\nI received your letter, which has given me no satisfaction concerning\r\nyour health; and as there has been a report in the paper that you was\r\nwounded, it has made us very uneasy, supposing it to be true; but I\r\nhope that it is not so, as I hear that people gives no credit to it. I\r\ngo to the school, since master is willing, and I like the teacher very\r\nmuch. He pays great attention to my learning, and I have teached Nancy\r\nher letters ever since you have been gone, which I think will be of as\r\nmuch service to her as if she went to school. We are all well at\r\npresent, and I hope that you are the same.\r\n\r\nPEGGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR. New-York, 12th January.\r\n\r\nHONOURED MASTER,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of the 4th inst., and it gives us great\r\nhappiness to hear that you are in good health, as all the family are\r\nexcept myself. I was taken sick on the 30th of last month, so that I\r\nhave not been able to go to school; and as I am better than I have\r\nbeen, to write these few lines; I am too weak to write Mrs. Alston,\r\nbut Elenora's child is well. The woman came here the 7th of this month\r\nfor the money, and Harry went to Mrs. Van Ness the 9th, and she said\r\nthat Mr. Van Ness did not tell her any thing of it, and she could not\r\ngive it.\r\n\r\nPEGGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1.

It\r\ndevelops his character, so far as the most sacred and confidential\r\ncommunications can develop it--as a friend--a husband--a parent--and a\r\nmaster. We are approaching a period, however, in his history when the\r\nscene is to be changed. In the spring of 1794 Mrs. Burr died; and in\r\n1801 his daughter was married, and removed to South Carolina. Thus\r\nterminated, in a great measure, all those domestic relations and\r\nenjoyments which had afforded him so much pleasure, and connected with\r\nwhich be had indulged the best feelings of his heart.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was a member of the Senate of the United States from the\r\n4th of March, 1791, until the 4th of March, 1797. During this period\r\nhe continued to practise the law. He was in that class of his\r\nprofession to which belonged a Hamilton, a Harrison, and a Livingston.\r\nThe partiality of some of his friends may have placed him at the head\r\nof the bar. His opponents ranked him second _only_ to their particular\r\nfavourite. As a speaker, Colonel Burr was calm and persuasive. He was\r\nmost remarkable for the power which he possessed of condensation. His\r\nappeals, whether to a court or a jury, were sententious and lucid. His\r\nspeeches, generally, were argumentative, short, and pithy. No flights\r\nof fancy, no metaphors, no parade of impassioned sentences, are to be\r\nfound in them. When employed on the same side of a cause with General\r\nHamilton, it was his uniform practice to permit that gentleman to\r\nselect his own place in the cause.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked that Colonel Burr's character could not be\r\nbetter drawn than it is in a short sketch of his father, by Governor\r\nLivingston. \"Though a person\" (says the governor) \"of a slender and\r\ndelicate make, to encounter fatigue he has a heart of steel; and, for\r\nthe despatch of business, the most amazing talents, joined to a\r\nconstancy of mind that ensures success in spite of every obstacle. As\r\nlong as an enterprise appears not absolutely impossible, he knows no\r\ndiscouragement; but, in proportion to its difficulty, augments his\r\ndiligence; and, by an insuperable fortitude, frequently accomplishes\r\nwhat his friends and acquaintance conceive utterly impracticable.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1793 Albert Gallatin was appointed a senator of the United\r\nStates by the State of Pennsylvania. On claiming his seat in January,\r\n1794, a petition was presented against his admission into that body,\r\non the ground that he had not been a citizen the requisite number of\r\nyears. The subject was referred to a committee of seven. Their report\r\nelicited a warm debate, which continued for several days. Colonel Burr\r\ntook an active part, and greatly distinguished himself in support of\r\nMr. Gallatin's claim. His colleague, Mr. King, had taken the lead\r\nagainst the right of Mr. Gallatin to a seat. John Taylor, of Caroline,\r\nVirginia, addressed a note to Colonel Burr, in which he says--\"We\r\nshall leave you to reply to King: _first_, because you desired it;\r\n_second_, all depends upon it; no one else _can_ do it, and the\r\naudience will expect it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, 1794, the Senate \"_Resolved_, That the\r\nelection of Albert Gallatin to be a senator of the United States was\r\nvoid, he not having been a citizen of the United States the term of\r\nyears required as a qualification to be a senator of the United\r\nStates.\"--Ays 14, nays 12.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1794, the Senate adopted a resolution,\r\ndeclaring that their galleries, at the commencement of the next\r\nsession, should be opened while the Senate were \"engaged in their\r\nlegislative capacity.\" For this, or a similar resolution, Colonel Burr\r\nhad voted at every previous session since he had been a member.\r\n\r\nHis personal respect for John Jay has been heretofore mentioned; but\r\non no occasion did he permit such feelings to interfere with his\r\npolitical acts, when called upon to perform a public duty. On the 16th\r\nof April, 1794, the president nominated John Jay, then chief-justice\r\nof the United States, as envoy extraordinary to Great Britain. On the\r\n19th, when the nomination was called up for consideration, Mr. Burr\r\noffered the following resolutions--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That any communications to be made to the court of Great\r\nBritain may be made through our minister now at that court with equal\r\nfacility and effect, and at much less expense, than by an envoy\r\nextraordinary; and that such an appointment is at present inexpedient\r\nand unnecessary:\r\n\r\n\"That to permit judges of the Supreme Court to hold, at the same time,\r\nany other office or employment emanating from, and holden at the\r\npleasure of, the executive, is contrary to the spirit of the\r\nconstitution; and, as tending to expose them to the influence of the\r\nexecutive, is mischievous and impolitic.\" Ays 10, nays 17.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was then confirmed by a vote of 18 to 8, Mr. Burr\r\nvoting in the negative. This vote, it was understood at the time, gave\r\npain to Mr. Jay. In a letter to his lady, dated the 20th of April, the\r\njudge says--\"Yesterday the Senate approved of the nomination by a\r\ngreat majority. _Mr. Burr was among the few who opposed it_.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this period the democratic party were highly incensed against\r\nthe president for continuing Gouverneur Morris as a minister to the\r\nFrench Republic. The Executive Provisory Council had requested his\r\nrecall. He was considered a monarchist, and hostile to the revolution.\r\nMany of the opposition senators had spoken with great freedom of the\r\npolicy of General Washington in this particular. These remarks having\r\nbeen communicated to the president, he expressed, informally, a\r\nwillingness to recall Mr. Morris, and to nominate a member of the\r\nopposition, if they would designate a suitable person. In consequence\r\nof this suggestion, the democratic members of the Senate, and some of\r\nthe most distinguished members of the House, had a conference, and\r\nresolved on recommending Colonel Burr. Mr. Madison, Mr. Monroe, and\r\nanother member of Congress whose name is not recollected, were\r\ndelegated to wait on the president and communicate the wishes of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington paused for a few moments, and then remarked, that\r\nhe had made it a rule of life never to recommend or nominate any\r\nperson for a high and responsible situation in whose integrity he had\r\nnot confidence; that, wanting confidence in Colonel Burr, he could not\r\nnominate him; but that it would give him great pleasure to meet their\r\nwishes if they would designate an individual in whom he could confide.\r\nThe committee returned and reported the result of their conference.\r\nThe senators adhered unanimously to their first nomination, and the\r\nsame delegates waited upon the president and reiterated the adherence\r\nof their friends to Colonel Burr. Whereupon General Washington, with\r\nsome warmth, remarked that his decision was irrevocable; but\r\nimmediately added, \"I will nominate you, Mr. Madison, or you, Mr.\r\nMonroe.\" The former replied that he had long since made up his mind\r\nnever to leave his country, and respectfully declined the offer. They\r\nretired, and reported the result of their second interview. The\r\ndemocratic gentlemen were not less inflexible, and instructed their\r\ndelegates to say to the president that they would make no other\r\nrecommendation. On the third visit they were received by Mr. Randolph,\r\nsecretary of state, to whom they made the communication, but who\r\nconsidered it indecorous, knowing the president's feelings, to repeat\r\nthe message.\r\n\r\nThis incident demonstrates, on the one hand, the strong and\r\nunchangeable prejudices of General Washington against Colonel Burr;\r\nand on the other, the firm and unbounded confidence reposed in him by\r\nthe democracy of those days. The anecdote is not related on the\r\nauthority exclusively of Colonel Burr. It is confirmed by the written\r\nstatement of a gentleman of high standing, to whom Mr. Monroe repeated\r\nall the details. No other selection was made by the opposition\r\nsenators; but, on the 27th of May, 1794, James Monroe was nominated as\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June, 1795, the president submitted to the Senate of the\r\nUnited States the treaty negotiated with Great Britain by John Jay.\r\nThis question called into operation all the powers of Mr. Burr's mind.\r\nHe was opposed to it in the form it had been negotiated. His views and\r\nopinions may be distinctly understood by comparing the amendments\r\nwhich he proposed with the original treaty. On the 22d June the Senate\r\nresumed the consideration of it, whereupon he offered the following\r\nresolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"That the further consideration of the treaty concluded at London the\r\n19th of November, 1794, be postponed, and that it be recommended to\r\nthe President of the United States to proceed without delay to further\r\nfriendly negotiation with his Britannic Majesty, in order to effect\r\nalterations in the said treaty in the following particulars:----\r\n\r\n\"That the 9th, 10th, and 24th articles, and so much of the 25th as\r\nrelates to the shelter or refuge to be given to the armed vessels of\r\nstates or sovereigns at war with either party, be expunged.\r\n\r\n\"2d Art. That no privilege or right be allowed to the settlers or\r\ntraders mentioned in the 2d article, other than those which are\r\nsecured to them by the treaty of 1783 and existing laws.\r\n\r\n\"3d. Art. That the 3d article be expunged, or be so modified that the\r\ncitizens of the United States may have the use of _all_ rivers, ports,\r\nand places within the territories of his Britannic Majesty in North\r\nAmerica, in the same manner as his subjects may have of those of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"6th Art. That the value of the negroes and other property carried\r\naway contrary to the 7th article of the treaty of 1783, _and the loss\r\nand damage sustained by the United States by the detention of the\r\nposts_, be paid for by the British government--the amount to be\r\nascertained by the commissioners who may be appointed to liquidate the\r\nclaims of the British creditors.\r\n\r\n\"12th Art. That what relates to the West India trade, and the provisos\r\nand conditions thereof in the 12th article, be expunged, or be\r\nrendered much more favourable to the United States, and without any\r\nrestraint on the exportation, in vessels of the United States, of any\r\narticles not the growth, produce, or manufacture of the said islands\r\nof his Britannic Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"15th Art. That no clause be admitted which may restrain the United\r\nStates from reciprocating benefits by discriminating between foreign\r\nnations in their commercial arrangements, or prevent them from\r\nincreasing the tonnage or other duties on British vessels on terms of\r\nreciprocity, or in a stipulated ratio.\r\n\r\n\"21st Art. That the subjects or citizens of either party be not\r\nrestrained from accepting commissions in the army or navy of any\r\nforeign power.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1797, while Colonel Burr was yet a member of the United States\r\nSenate, his mind was occupied with the project of a bank, and he\r\nconferred with several of his personal friends on the subject. Among\r\nothers, he wrote the honourable Thomas Morris, who was at the time a\r\nmember of the state Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MORRIS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 1st February, 1797.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have been informed that the present sheriff of Dutchess either has\r\nresigned or will decline a reappointment, and that Platt Smith is\r\namong the candidates. I have very little personal acquaintance with\r\nMr. Smith--am not, indeed, certain that I should recognise him if I\r\nshould meet him; but I have long known him by reputation, and can\r\nassure you that he is a man of irreproachable character, of\r\nindependent property, and much above ordinary in point of\r\nintelligence. His connexions are very influential (perhaps the most\r\nso) in that county. He is, in short, a man, in my opinion, every way\r\nqualified to fill the office. Has always been of your party, and\r\nsupported Jay's election. He is withal a generous, manly, independent\r\nfellow, of that cast which you like; one who will feel sensibly any\r\nfavours or civilities which may be done him. If you should not be\r\notherwise pledged, you will oblige several of your personal friends by\r\nsupporting his pretensions.\r\n\r\nI have drawn out a plan for a bank, but find that it will require so\r\nmany explanations that I forbear to send it. I perceive that you are\r\nabout selling our stock in the funds of the United States. We have\r\nalready talked over this matter. The more I reflect, the stronger\r\nappear the objections. It will doubtless be urged in favour of an\r\nimmediate sale, that our funds are in danger of seizure by the United\r\nStates. This is a mere bugbear. Such a thing will never again be even\r\nproposed, and, if proposed, will never receive three votes in the\r\nSenate. I hope, therefore, our legislature will not suffer themselves\r\nto be precipitated into this sale from any such unfounded\r\napprehensions.\r\n\r\nMr. Belasies, a gentleman, a man of education and fortune, by birth an\r\nEnglishman, has come out with his family to reside in this country. If\r\nhe should apply for leave to hold lands in this state, I hope he may\r\nbe gratified; from the little I have seen, and the much I have heard\r\nof him, I am persuaded that he will be a valuable acquisition to any\r\nstate and to any society. He is no politician.\r\n\r\nI return to-morrow to Philadelphia, where I shall remain for this\r\nmonth. May l expect to see you here in the spring? Present me most\r\nrespectfully to Williamson, and be assured of my esteem and\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, 1798, Colonel Burr was elected a member of Assembly for the\r\ncity and county of New-York by the democratic party. This year was\r\nmarked with more political virulence than any other year since the\r\nindependence of the country. It was during the year 1798 that the\r\nalien and sedition laws were passed. In the autumn of 1798, Matthew\r\nLyon, then a representative in Congress from Vermont, was endicted for\r\nharbouring an intention \"to stir up sedition, and to bring the\r\npresident and government of the United States into contempt,\" &c. He\r\nwas convicted, and the sentence was--\"Matthew Lyon, it is the pleasure\r\nof this court that you be imprisoned four months, pay costs, and a\r\nfine of one thousand dollars, and stand committed until the judgment\r\nbe complied with.\" This year the celebrated mission to France,\r\nconsisting of Messrs. Marshall, Pinckney, and Gerry, excited the\r\nattention not only of the American people, but of the civilized world.\r\nIn short, this year the foundation was laid for the overthrow of\r\nfederal power in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn no section of the country was there more political excitement than\r\nin New-York. Parties were nearly balanced. There were only two banks\r\nin the city; the Bank of New-York, and the branch of the United States\r\nBank. They were charged with being influenced in their discounts by\r\npolitical considerations. At all events, they were under the\r\nmanagement and control of federalists; and to counteract their alleged\r\ninfluence, Colonel Burr was anxious for the establishment of a\r\ndemocratic institution. With this view he proposed to obtain a charter\r\nfor supplying the city with water; and as it was certain that if\r\nconfined to that particular object the stock would not be subscribed,\r\nhe caused the application to be made for two millions of dollars, and\r\ninserted a clause in that charter, that the \"surplus capital might be\r\nemployed in any way not inconsistent with the laws and constitution of\r\nthe United States or of the State of New-York.\" It is under this\r\nclause that the Manhattan Company use and exercise all the privileges\r\nof a bank. The directors were named in the charter, and a majority of\r\nthem were of the democratic party.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the charter was obtained by trick and\r\nmanagement; and that, if suspicion bad been entertained by any of the\r\nfederal members, Colonel Burr could not have got the bill through the\r\nlegislature. It is due to him, so far as it can be justly done, to\r\nrescue his memory from the imputation of having _misrepresented_ or\r\n_misstated_ to any member the object he had in view. The facts in\r\nreference to the passage of the charter of the Manhattan Company\r\nthrough the Senate will now be given. The statement is upon authority\r\nthat cannot be contradicted.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill had passed the Assembly and was sent to the Senate,\r\nColonel Burr, during the hours of business, went into the Senate\r\nChamber, and requested a federal senator (now living) from the western\r\ndistrict to move a reference of that bill to a select committee, to\r\nreport complete, which would supersede the necessity of its going to a\r\ncommittee of the whole. The senator replied, that though he had no\r\nobjection to make the experiment, yet that he was persuaded the motion\r\nwould not prevail, because the Senate, not having a press of business\r\nbefore them, uniformly refused thus committing bills to select\r\ncommittees instead of a committee of the whole. Colonel Burr then\r\nsuggested, that perhaps if the mover would intimate, while on the\r\nfloor, that the honourable Samuel Jones was contemplated as chairman\r\nof that committee, the confidence which the Senate was known to repose\r\nin him, and in his uniform attention to every thing relating to the\r\ncity of New-York, would perhaps induce the Senate on this occasion to\r\ndepart from its accustomed mode of proceeding. Accordingly the motion\r\nwas made, and passed without opposition.\r\n\r\nThe committee named by the honourable Stephen Van Rensselaer, then\r\nlieutenant-governor, were Samuel Jones, Ambrose Spencer, and Thomas\r\nMorris. It was suggested to one of these gentlemen that the part of\r\nthe bill authorizing the employment of the surplus capital had better\r\nbe stricken out of it; in consequence of which that gentleman applied\r\nto Colonel Burr for an explanation on this point. Mr. Burr promptly\r\nand frankly informed the honourable member, that it not only did\r\nauthorize, but that it was in tended the directors should use the\r\nsurplus capital in any way they thought expedient and proper. That\r\nthey might have a bank, an East India Company, or any thing else that\r\nthey deemed profitable. That the mere supplying the city with water\r\nwould not, of itself, remunerate the stockholders. Colonel Burr added,\r\nthat the senator was at liberty to communicate this explanation to\r\nother members, and that be had no secrecy on the subject. The bill was\r\nsubsequently reported by Mr. Jones and passed.\r\n\r\nThis view of the proceedings of the legislature is sustained by what\r\noccurred in the Council of Revision, from the minutes of which an\r\nextract has been made.\r\n\r\n\"_At a meeting of the Council of Revision, held at the City Hall of\r\nthe City of Albany, on Monday, the 1st of April, 1799._\r\n\r\n\"PRESENT--His Excellency the Governor, the Honourable the Chancellor,\r\nthe Chief Justice, and Judge Benson.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Robbins, from the honourable the Assembly,\r\ndelivered to the council the bill entitled _An act for the relief of\r\nJohn Lansing_, the bill entitled _An act for supplying the city of\r\nNew-York with pure and wholesome water_, and the bill entitled _An act\r\nto amend the statute of limitation_, and the bill entitled _An act\r\nmaking provision to keep in repair the bridge over Schoharie Creek, at\r\nFort Hunter, in the county of Montgomery_.\r\n\r\n\"The council proceeded to take the said bills into consideration, and\r\nthereupon\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the bill entitled _An act for supplying the city of\r\nNew-York with pure and wholesome water_ be committed to the honourable\r\nthe Chief Justice; that the bill entitled _An act to amend the statute\r\nof limitation_ be committed to the honourable the Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\n\"_At a meeting of the Council of Revision, held at the City Hall of\r\nthe City of Albany, on Tuesday, the 2d of April, 1799._\r\n\r\n\"PRESENT--His Excellency the Governor, the Honourable the Chancellor,\r\nthe Chief Justice, and Judge Benson.\r\n\r\n\"The honourable the Chief Justice, to whom was committed the bill\r\nentitled _An act for supplying the city of New-York with pure and\r\nwholesome water_, reported the following objections, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"_Because_ the bill creates a corporation, with a capital of two\r\nmillions of dollars, vested with the unusual power to divert its\r\nsurplus capital to the purchase of public or other stock, _or any\r\nother moneyed transactions or operations not inconsistent with the\r\nconstitution and laws of this state or of the United States_, and\r\nwhich surplus may be applied to the purposes of trade, or any other\r\npurpose which the very comprehensive terms in which the clause is\r\nconceived may warrant; this, in the opinion of the council as a novel\r\nexperiment, the result whereof as to its influence on the community\r\nmust be merely speculative and uncertain, peculiarly requires the\r\napplication of the policy which has heretofore uniformly obtained,\r\nthat the powers of corporations relative to their money operations\r\nshould be of limited instead of perpetual duration.\"\r\n\r\n\"The council proceeded to take the preceding objections into\r\nconsideration, which were overruled; it was thereupon\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That it does not appear improper to the council that the\r\nsaid bill, entitled _An act for supplying the city of New-York with\r\npure and wholesome water_, should become a law of this state.\r\n\r\n\"_Ordered_, That the honourable the Chancellor deliver a copy of the\r\npreceding resolution, signed by his excellency the Governor, to the\r\nhonourable the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_State of New-York, Secretary's Office_.\r\n\r\n\"I certify the preceding to be true extracts from the minutes of the\r\nCouncil of Revision of this state.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n\"ARCHD. CAMPBELL,\r\n\r\n\"_Deputy Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\"_Albany, April 29th_, 1836.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the correctness of the above statement, and the fairness of Mr.\r\nBurr's conduct in relation to the Manhattan Company, there cannot be\r\nthe shadow of a doubt; but it is probable that a large portion of the\r\nmembers never attempted to examine into the extent of the powers\r\ngranted to the Manhattan Company; while another portion considered the\r\nproject of Colonel Burr, in reference to an East India Company or a\r\nbank, as chimerical and visionary. It is, however, evident that no\r\ntrick or misrepresentation was practised to procure the passage of the\r\nbill; unless, indeed, his silence on the floor of the house as to his\r\nulterior views may be so construed. His object was a bank; and when\r\nappealed to on this particular point, he admitted the fact. At all\r\nother times he remained silent on the subject. When the bill had\r\npassed he was lauded by the democratic party for his address, and they\r\nrejoiced in his success. Its political effect was considered highly\r\nimportant, as it tended to break down a system of pecuniary\r\nfavouritism, which was made to operate in support of the party in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1799 vague rumours were privately circulated\r\nrespecting certain transactions of Colonel Burr with the Holland Land\r\nCompany. It was whispered that a bond, which the company held against\r\nhim for twenty thousand dollars, had been given up for secret services\r\nrendered them. In other circles it was hinted that the compensation\r\nwas for procuring the passage of a bill through the legislature\r\nauthorizing aliens to hold lands, &c. Connected with these rumours,\r\nJohn B. Church, Esq. had spoken with so much freedom as to produce a\r\nchallenge from Colonel Burr. On the 2d of September, 1799, the parties\r\nmet at Hoboken, and having exchanged a shot without effect, Mr. Church\r\nmade the _amende honorable_, and the affair was so satisfactorily\r\nadjusted as to restore the social intercourse of these gentlemen. Mr.\r\nChurch was attended by Abijah Hammond, Esq., and Colonel Burr by Judge\r\nEdanus Burke, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nOn the ground a most ludicrous incident occurred. Previous to leaving\r\nthe city of New-York, Colonel Burr presented to Judge Burke his\r\npistol-case. He explained to the Judge that the balls were cast\r\nintentionally too small; that chamois leather was cut to the proper\r\nsize to put round them, but that the leather must be greased (for\r\nwhich purpose grease was placed in the case), or that there would be a\r\ndifficulty in getting the ball home. After the parties had taken their\r\nstand, Colonel Burr noticed the judge hammering the ramrod with a\r\nstone, and immediately suspected the cause. When the pistol was handed\r\nhim by his friend, he drew the ramrod, and ascertained that the ball\r\nwas not home, and so informed the judge; to which Mr. Burke replied,\r\n\"I forgot to grease the leather; but you see he is ready, don't keep\r\nhim waiting; _just take a crack as it is, and I'll grease the next_!\"\r\nColonel Burr bowed courteously, but made no reply, and discharged his\r\npistol in the state it had been given to him. The anecdote for some\r\ntime after was the subject of merriment among those who had heard it.\r\n\r\nNo explanation was ever given, it is believed, of the transactions\r\nbetween Colonel Burr and the Holland Land Company. It was his practice\r\nto let his actions speak for themselves, and to let the world construe\r\nthem as they pleased. This was a great error, and was the source in\r\nafter life of much trouble and suffering to him, yet he would not\r\ndepart from it. A few weeks subsequent to this duel, however, be\r\nreceived from a friend a kind letter, asking confidentially an\r\nexplanation of these transactions, to which he replied,\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL BURR TO -----.\r\n\r\nNew-York, 6th October, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI cannot refuse to the manner of your request, nor to the friendly\r\nmotives which have produced it, to satisfy your inquiries with regard\r\nto Witbeck's bond and the Holland Company.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1795 or 1796, I forget which, I entered into a covenant\r\nwith the Holland Company for the purchase of one hundred thousand\r\nacres of land, at twelve shillings per acre, payable by instalments.\r\nThe covenant contained a penalty of twenty thousand dollars; as\r\nsecurity on my part for this penalty, in case it should become due, I\r\nmortgaged to Cazenove, or the Holland Company, twenty thousand acres\r\nof land in Presque Isle, being one hundred shares of two hundred acres\r\neach in the Population Company, and I assigned to him Thomas L.\r\nWitbeck's bond, payable to me, for twenty thousand dollars, as further\r\ncollateral security.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1797 Cazenove joined with me in a power of attorney to\r\nJames Wadsworth, then in Europe, for the sale of one hundred thousand\r\nacres, and, until the summer or fall of the year following, we had\r\nreason to believe that they were or would be sold, which of course\r\nwould have terminated all questions about the penalty. Some time in\r\nthe year 1797 or 1798, it was noised in Albany that Thomas L. Witbeck\r\nhad given a bond for twenty thousand dollars, and his credit at the\r\nbank and elsewhere became affected by it. He wrote me often on the\r\nsubject. In reply, I begged him to explain that the bond was not for\r\nthe payment of money, and that, even if it should become forfeited,\r\nthe twenty thousand acres of Presque Isle lands were alone a\r\nsufficient security. Witbeck, however, continued to be uneasy for his\r\ncredit, and teased me to take up his bond by giving other security. I\r\nthought this rather unkind, and did not trouble myself about it.\r\nIndeed, I was in hopes that the sale of the land in Europe would have\r\nclosed the transaction. Not long after this, I think in November last,\r\nCazenove informed me that be had been applied to by Witbeck to change\r\nthat security, and added that he was willing to change it for one of\r\nequal solidity, provided it would not impair his rights.\r\n\r\nWitbeck's importunities continued, and he became so very urgent and\r\nrepeated that I was finally (November last), long after the passing of\r\nthe alien bill, induced to offer A. I. Frederick Prevost's bond in the\r\nplace of Witbeck's. Cazenove took time to consider and inquire; and\r\nfinding, in fact, that Prevost's bond was a much better one than\r\nWitbeck's, agreed to take it. Prevost accordingly executed _to me_ a\r\nbond for twenty thousand dollars, of which Harrison drew a special\r\nassignment to the Holland Company. We made a memorandum that this\r\nexchange should not vary the rights of the parties (viz., the Holland\r\nCompany and Aaron Burr), and Thomas L. Witbeck's bond was given up. In\r\nthis transaction I never suspected that Cazenove imagined that _he_\r\nwas doing a favour either to me or Thomas L. Witbeck, and I am\r\nconfident that he never entertained so absurd a belief. It was with\r\ngreat reluctance that I gave Prevost's bond. I had claims on Witbeck\r\nwhich justified me in exposing him to some hazard. Prevost had a\r\nfamily, a clear, independent estate, and did not owe a cent in the\r\nworld; but he had better nerves than Witbeck, and would not tease me.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we learned that all prospect of selling the land in\r\nEurope had failed, and as I never had an expectation of paying except\r\nfrom the land itself, it became necessary to close the transaction. It\r\nshould be observed, that soon after my contract with Cazenove he\r\nreceived orders, as he informed me, to sell no more under sixteen\r\nshillings (two dollars), and afterward I understood that he had raised\r\nthe price to twenty shillings. In December last we had several\r\nconferences for the purpose of settling this business. I offered to\r\ngive back the land and cancel the covenants. He talked of the penalty.\r\nI replied that be would only recover the damages sustained, which, by\r\nhis own account, were nothing; for, as the price of the land was\r\nraised to twenty shillings, the Holland Company would, by their own\r\nestimation, gain one hundred thousand dollars by taking back the land.\r\nHe appeared to feel the unreasonableness of his demand, and finally\r\nevaded my proposal by questioning his own authority. This I considered\r\nas a pretence; some irritation ensued, and we parted without\r\nconcluding any thing.\r\n\r\nThus the matter remained until May last (1799), when our negotiations\r\nwere renewed. After various overtures and propositions on either side,\r\nit was at length agreed that I should convey to the Holland Company,\r\nabsolutely, the twenty thousand acres Presque Isle lands. That this\r\nshould be received in discharge of the advances that Cazenove had made\r\nthereon, and in full satisfaction of all damages claimed on the\r\ncovenants; and that thereupon the covenants should be cancelled, the\r\nbond of I. A. Frederick Prevost be given up, and the Holland Company\r\ntake back their lands. This was accordingly done a few days before\r\nCazenove sailed for Europe, which was, I think, in June last.\r\n\r\nI should have noted, that about the year 1792 or 1793, I became\r\njointly concerned with the Holland Company and sundry individuals in\r\nthe purchase from the State of Pennsylvania of the whole Presque Isle\r\nangle, and of other lands adjoining to the amount of a million of\r\nacres. The association was called the Population Company, and was\r\nunder the management of directors, who had a right to assess on the\r\nproprietors or associates any sums they might think proper to promote\r\nthe settlements required by the patents. My interest was one hundred\r\nshares, or twenty thousand acres, for which I had paid, at the time I\r\nmortgaged to Cazenove, upwards of seven thousand five hundred dollars.\r\nThe thing was considered as extremely valuable, and I have no doubt\r\nbut my interest would, if I could have retained it five years, have\r\nbeen worth to me more than one hundred thousand dollars. Lands within\r\nthe angle were last year sold at twenty dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nThough it be obvious that no damages were due or could have been\r\nrecovered by the Holland Company on the penalty contained in the\r\ncovenants, yet I had several motives to urge me to some sacrifice in\r\norder to get rid of the business. _First._ I could not repay the\r\nadvances made by Cazenove, which amounted to several thousand dollars.\r\n_Second._ I could not bear to give any uneasiness to Frederick\r\nPrevost, which might have been the consequence of a legal proceeding.\r\n_Third._ I was a little apprehensive of being sued on the covenants\r\nfor payment of the purchase money. Cazenove, on his part, had but a\r\nsingle motive, to wit--he found that these lands were all I had to\r\ngive, and that a suit would have produced only expense.\r\n\r\nThe aforegoing facts are substantially known to Le Roy, Bayard, and\r\nMcEvers, and to Harrison and Ogden. The two last were consulted on the\r\nclosing of the business in May and June last (1799). The former of\r\nthem, Harrison, several times on the exchange of the bonds. I have not\r\nspoken to either of those gentlemen on the subject since the\r\ntransactions took place; but any person is at liberty to do it who may\r\nchoose to take the trouble.\r\n\r\nI have given you a summary of my whole concern with Cazenove and the\r\nHolland Company, not knowing what part of it might tend to elucidate\r\nyour inquiries.\r\n\r\nBy those who know me, it will never be credited that any man on earth\r\nwould have the hardiness even to propose to me dishonourable\r\ncompensations; but this apart, the absurdity of the calumny you allude\r\nto is obvious from the following data, resulting from the deeds and\r\nknown facts:\r\n\r\nThat at the time the Alien Bill was under consideration, and long\r\nafter, the bond, the covenant, and the penalty were objects of no\r\nconcern, as we had reason to believe that the lands were or would be\r\nsold in Europe, so as to leave me a profit:\r\n\r\nThat Witbeck's bond was _never given up_, but exchanged for one more\r\nsafe and valuable:\r\n\r\nThat I had not, nor by possibility could have, any interest in this\r\nexchange, as it was relieving one friend to involve another still more\r\ndear to me:\r\n\r\nThat, so far from any understanding between Cazenove and me, we had\r\ncontroversies about the very bond and penalty for more than a year\r\nafter the passing of the Alien Bill: That no part of the penalty was\r\never due from me to the Holland Company; and that of course, they\r\ncould never have demanded the bond, which was expressly a security for\r\nthe penalty, and not for the payments:\r\n\r\nThat nevertheless I did finally give Cazenove a valuable and\r\nexorbitant compensation to induce him to cancel the covenants and\r\ndischarge the penalty.\r\n\r\nThis, sir, is the first time in my life that I have condescended\r\n(pardon the expression) to refute a calumny. I leave to my actions to\r\nspeak for themselves, and to my character to confound the fictions of\r\nslander. And on this very subject I have not up to this hour given one\r\nword of explanation to any human being. All the explanation that can\r\nbe given amounts to no more than this--_That the thing is an absolute\r\nand abominable lie_. I feel that the present detail is useless and\r\ntrifling; but you have asked with good-nature, and I could not, with\r\nthe appearance of good-nature, refuse. I pardon you the labour I have\r\nhad in writing, and for that which you will have in reading no apology\r\ncan be due from\r\n\r\nYour friend and obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1801, Colonel Burr's daughter Theodosia was married to\r\nJoseph Alston, Esq., of South Carolina. Mr. Alston was in his\r\ntwenty-second, Miss Burr in her eighteenth year. He was a gentleman of\r\ntalents and fortune, and a few years after his marriage was chosen\r\ngovernor. Some opinion of his style of writing may be formed by his\r\ndefence of early marriages; while that portion of his letter which\r\nrelates to his native state cannot be uninteresting to South\r\nCarolinians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA BURR TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, January 13th, 1801.\r\n\r\nI have already written to you by the post to tell you that I shall be\r\nhappy to see you _whenever you choose;_ that I suppose is equivalent\r\nto _very soon;_ and that you may no longer feel doubts or suspicions\r\non my account, I repeat the invitation by a packet as less dilatory\r\nthan the mail; but for all these doubts and suspicions I will take\r\nample revenge when we meet.\r\n\r\nI yesterday received your letter of the 26th of December, and am\r\nexpecting your defence of early marriages to-day. My father laughs at\r\nmy impatience to hear from you, and says I am in love; but I do not\r\nbelieve that to be a fair deduction, for the post is really very\r\nirregular and slow--enough so to provoke anybody.\r\n\r\nWe leave this for Albany on the 26th inst., and shall remain there\r\ntill the 10th February. My movements will after that depend upon my\r\nfather and _you_. I had intended not to marry this twelvemonth, and in\r\nthat case thought it wrong to divert you from your present engagements\r\nin Carolina; but to your solicitations I yield my judgment. Adieu. I\r\nwish you many returns of the century.\r\n\r\n14th January.\r\n\r\nI have not yet received your promised letter; but I hope it may be\r\nlong in proportion to the time I have been expecting it. The packet\r\nhas been delayed by head-winds, but now that they are fair she will\r\nhave a quick passage; at least such I wish it. Adieu, encore.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON TO THEODOSIA BURR.\r\n\r\nCharleston, S. C. December 28th, 1800.\r\n\r\nAristotle says \"that a man should not marry before he is\r\nsix-and-thirty:\" pray, Mr. Alston, what arguments have you to oppose\r\nto such authority? Hear me, Miss Burr.\r\n\r\nIt has always been my practice, whether from a natural independence of\r\nmind, from pride, or what other cause I will not pretend to say, never\r\nto adopt the opinion of any one, however respectable his authority,\r\nunless thoroughly convinced by his arguments; the \"ipse dixit,\" as\r\nlogicians term it, even of Cicero, who stands higher in my estimation\r\nthan any other author, would not have the least weight with me; you\r\nmust therefore, till you offer better reasons in support of his\r\nopinion than the Grecian sage himself has done, excuse my differing\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nObjections to early marriages can rationally only arise from want of\r\ndiscretion or want of fortune in the parties; now, as you very well\r\nobserve, the age of discretion is wholly uncertain, some men reaching\r\nit at twenty, others at thirty, some again not till fifty, and many\r\nnot at all; of course, to fix such or such a period as the proper one\r\nfor marrying, is ridiculous. Even the want of fortune is to be\r\nconsidered differently, according to the country where the marriage is\r\nto take place; for though in some places a fortune is absolutely\r\nnecessary to a man before he marries, there are others, as in the\r\neastern states for example, where he marries expressly for the purpose\r\nof making a fortune.\r\n\r\nBut, allowing both these objections their full force, may there not be\r\na single case that they do not reach? Suppose (_for instance, merely_)\r\na young man nearly two-and-twenty, already of the _greatest_\r\ndiscretion, with an ample fortune, were to be passionately in love\r\nwith a young lady almost eighteen, equally discreet with himself, and\r\nwho had a \"sincere friendship\" for him, do you think it would be\r\nnecessary to make him wait till thirty? particularly where the friends\r\non both sides were pleased with the match.\r\n\r\nWere I to consider the question personally, since you allow that\r\n\"individual character\" ought to be consulted, no objection clearly\r\ncould be made to my marrying early.\r\n\r\nFrom my father's plan of education for me, I may properly be called a\r\nhot-bed plant. Introduced from my infancy into the society of men,\r\nwhile yet a boy I was accustomed to think and act like a man. On every\r\noccasion, however important, I was left to decide for myself; I do not\r\nrecollect a single instance where I was controlled even by advice; for\r\nit was my father's invariable maxim, that the best way of\r\nstrengthening the judgment was to suffer it to be constantly\r\nexercised. Before seventeen I finished my college education; before\r\ntwenty I was admitted to the bar. Since that time I have been\r\nconstantly travelling through different parts of the United States; to\r\nwhat purpose I leave you to determine.\r\n\r\nFrom this short account of myself you may judge whether my manners and\r\nsentiments are not, by this time, in some degree formed.\r\n\r\nBut let us treat the subject abstractedly; and, as we have shown that\r\nunder particular circumstances no disadvantages result from early\r\nmarriages, let us see if any positive advantages attend them.\r\n\r\nHappiness in the marriage state, you will agree with me, can only be\r\nobtained from the most complete congeniality of mind and disposition,\r\nand the most exact similarity of habits and pursuits; now, though\r\ntheir natures may generally resemble, no two persons can be entirely\r\nof the same mind and disposition, the same habits and pursuits, unless\r\nafter the most intimate and early association; I say early, for it is\r\nin youth only the mind and disposition receive the complexion we would\r\ngive them; it is then only that our habits are moulded or our pursuits\r\ndirected as we please; as we advance in life they become fixed and\r\nunchangeable, and instead of our governing them, govern us. Is it not\r\n_therefore_ better, upon every principle of happiness, that persons\r\nshould marry young, when, directed by mutual friendship, each might\r\nassimilate to the other, than wait till a period when their passions,\r\ntheir prejudices, their habits, &c. become so rooted that there\r\nneither exists an inclination nor power to correct them? Dr. Franklin,\r\na very strong advocate for my system, and, I think, at least as good\r\nauthority as Aristotle, very aptly compares those who marry early to\r\ntwo young trees joined together by the hand of the gardener;\r\n  \"Trunk knit with trunk, and branch with branch intwined,\r\n  Advancing still, more closely they are join'd;\r\n  At length, full grown, no difference we see,\r\n  But, 'stead of two, behold a single tree!\" [1]\r\n\r\nThose, on the other hand, who do not marry till late, say \"thirty,\"\r\nfor example, he likens to two ancient oaks;\r\n\r\n  \"Use all your force, they yield not to your hand,\r\n  But firmly in their usual stations stand;\r\n  While each, regardless of the other's views,\r\n  Stubborn and fix'd, it's natural bent pursues!\" [2]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all; it is in youth that we are best fitted to enjoy\r\nthat exquisite happiness which the marriage state is capable of\r\naffording, and the remembrance of which forms so pleasing a link in\r\nthat chain of friendship that binds to each other two persons who have\r\nlived together any number of years. Our ideas are then more refined;\r\nevery generous and disinterested sentiment beats higher; and our\r\nsensibility is far more alive to every emotion our associate may feel.\r\nDepend upon it, the man who does not love till \"thirty\" will never,\r\nnever love; long before that period, he will become too much enamoured\r\nof his own dear self to think of transferring his affections to any\r\nother object. He may marry, but interest alone will direct him in the\r\nchoice of his wife; far from regarding her as the sweetest friend and\r\ncompanion of his life, he will consider her but as an unavoidable\r\nencumbrance upon the estate she brings him. And can you really hope,\r\nmy Theodosia, with all your ingenuity, to convince me that such a\r\nbeing will enjoy equal happiness in marriage with me? with me, about\r\nto enter into it with such rapture; who anticipate so perfect a\r\n_heaven_ from our uniting in every study, improving our minds\r\ntogether, and informing each other by our mutual assistance and\r\nobservations? No--I give you full credit for your talents, but there\r\nare some causes so bad that even you cannot support them.\r\n\r\nEnough, however, of this topic till we meet; I have already given you\r\na volume of nonsense upon it.\r\n\r\nNow for the fable, I cannot call it description, your \"dear friends\"\r\nhave given you of this state. \"The country,\" they say, because of the\r\nmarshy grounds, \"is rendered continually unhealthy with fever and\r\nagues.\" One would really conclude from this that we were a good\r\nrepresentation of a meeting of _Shaking Quakers_. Alas! beautiful and\r\nromantic hills of Carolina, which the delighted traveller so often\r\nstops to admire; fair and fertile plains interspersed with groves of\r\nthe orange, the lemon, and the myrtle, which fling such healthful\r\nfragrance to the air, where are ye fled? Has some earthquake, some\r\nsudden and dreadful concussion of nature, ingulfed you? No! You still\r\nremain for the delight and ornament of our country; you have lost\r\nexistence only in the imagination of some beau or belle of New-York;\r\nwho, ignorant of the geography and appearance of the most celebrated\r\nstates, believes every other place except the Park and the Battery a\r\ndesert or a marsh. But let us proceed:--\"As to Charleston, an annual\r\nepidemic, joined to the yells of whipped negroes, which assail your\r\nears from every house, and the extreme heat, make it a perfect\r\npurgatory!\" What! is Charleston, the most delightfully situated city\r\nin America, which, entirely open to the ocean, twice in every\r\ntwenty-four hours is cooled by the refreshing seabreeze, the\r\nMontpelier of the south, which annually affords an asylum to the\r\nplanter and the West-Indian from every disease, accused of heat and\r\nunhealthiness?--Island of Calypso, where reigned perpetual spring! may\r\nwe not, after this, expect thy flower-enamelled fields to be\r\nmetamorphosed into dreary wastes of snow, and the sweet concerts of\r\nthe feathered choir, which elysionized thy woods, converted into the\r\nhowling of the tiger, or the horrid bark of the wolf? But this is not\r\nall, unfortunate citizens of Charleston; your disposition has been\r\neven still more outraged than your climate. Your mildness, humanity,\r\nand benevolence, are no more; cruelty, barbarity, a sanguinary love of\r\ntorture, are now your distinguishing characteristics; the scream, the\r\nyell of the miserable, unresisting African, bleeding under the scourge\r\nof relentless power, affords music to your ears! Ah! from what\r\nunfriendly cause does this arise? Has the God of heaven, in anger,\r\nhere changed the order of nature? In every other region, without\r\nexception, in a similar degree of latitude, the same sun which ripens\r\nthe tamarind and the anana, ameliorates the temper, and disposes it to\r\ngentleness and kindness. In India and other countries not very\r\ndifferent in climate from the southern parts of the United States, the\r\ninhabitants are distinguished for a softness and inoffensiveness of\r\nmanners, degenerating almost to effeminacy; it is here then, only,\r\nthat we are exempt from the general influence of climate: here only\r\nthat, in spite of it, we are cruel and ferocious! Poor Carolina!\r\n\r\n\"The state of society, too, is equally inviting. The men and women\r\nassociate very little; the former employ themselves either in the\r\nbusiness of life, or in hunting horse-racing, and gaming; while the\r\nlatter meet in large parties, composed entirely of themselves, to sip\r\ntea and look prim!\" Would a stranger who had been among us, who had\r\nwitnessed the polished state of our society, the elegance of our\r\nparties, the case and sociability of manners which prevail there, the\r\nconstant and agreeable intercourse between the sexes, the\r\naccomplishments of our ladies, that proud and elevated spirit among\r\nthe men which would feel \"a stain like a wound,\" believe the account\r\nyou have written meant as a picture of South Carolina? Would he\r\nbelieve, still further, that it was drawn by an American? No. He would\r\nsuppose it the production of some jaundiced foreigner, who had never\r\nvisited us, and who set down every thing out of his own country as\r\nrude and Gothic. Now I recollect Morse gives a description something\r\nlike this of _North_ Carolina; and I suspect your \"friends\" stole\r\ntheir account, with a little exaggeration, from him, but mistook the\r\nstate. I have now replied to the fable of your \"dear friends\" in a\r\n_veritable_ style; but, setting aside rhapsody, if you have time to\r\nread it, I will give you a proper and impartial account of our country\r\nin a few words. Possibly it may serve to amuse you, if still confined\r\nby your ankle.\r\n\r\nFor about sixty or seventy miles from the seacoast, the land is,\r\nperhaps, more uninterruptedly level than any equal tract of territory\r\nin the United States; from that distance it gradually becomes more\r\nhilly, till, as you advance into the interior, you become entangled in\r\nthat chain of mountains which, rising in the back parts of\r\nPennsylvania, runs through that state, touches a corner of Maryland,\r\nand, extending through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,\r\nforms a line between the Atlantic and transatlantic states. In upper\r\nCarolina it is as healthy as anywhere on the continent. The people are\r\nrobust, active, and have a colour as fine as those of Rhode Island. In\r\nthe low country, it is true, we are visited by \"the fevers and agues\"\r\nyou mention, but it is only at a particular season, and near the banks\r\nof the rivers. In this we are by no means singular; those who reside\r\non the borders of the lakes, the Connecticut, the Delaware, and the\r\nPotomac, are equally exposed. On the seacoast we again find health;\r\nCharleston, till within a few years past, was remarkably healthy.\r\nSince '93 it has been afflicted, at different times, during the\r\nsummer, with an epidemic, which has certainly proved extremely fatal;\r\nbut ought it to be called an \"annual visitant\" here any more than at\r\nBoston, New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, &c., all of which places\r\nhave been equally, and some of them more, afflicted by it?\r\n\r\nWith regard to our manners; if there is any state which has a claim to\r\nsuperior refinement, it is certainly South Carolina. Generally\r\nspeaking, we are divided into but two classes, very rich and very\r\npoor; which, if no advantage in a political view, is undoubtedly\r\nfavourable to a polished state of society. Our gentlemen having large\r\nfortunes, and being very little disposed by the climate to the\r\ndrudgery of business or professions, have full leisure for the\r\nattainment of polite literature, and what are usually called\r\naccomplishments; you therefore meet with few of them who are not\r\ntolerably well informed, agreeable companions, and completely well\r\nbred. The possession of slaves renders them proud, impatient of\r\nrestraint, and gives them a haughtiness of manner which, to those\r\nunaccustomed to them, is disagreeable; but we find among them a high\r\nsense of honour, a delicacy of sentiment, and a liberality of mind,\r\nwhich we look for in vain in the more commercial citizens of the\r\nnorthern states. The genius of the Carolinian, like the inhabitants of\r\nall southern countries, is quick, lively, and acute; in steadiness and\r\nperseverance he is naturally inferior to the native of the north; but\r\nthis defect of climate is often overcome by his ambition or necessity;\r\nand, whenever this happens, he seldom fails to distinguish himself. In\r\nhis temper he is gay and fond of company, open, generous, and\r\nunsuspicious; easily irritated, and quick to resent even the\r\nappearance of insult; but his passion, like the fire of the flint, is\r\nlighted up and extinguished in the same moment. I do not mention his\r\nhospitality and kindness to strangers, for they are so common they are\r\nno longer esteemed virtues; like common honesty, they are noticed only\r\nwhen not possessed. Nor is it for the elegance of their manners only\r\nthat the South Carolinians are distinguished; sound morality is\r\nequally conspicuous among them. Gaming, so far from being a\r\nfashionable vice, is confined entirely to the lower class of people;\r\namong gentlemen it is deemed disgraceful. Many of them, it is true,\r\nare fond of the turf; but they pursue the sports of it merely as an\r\namusement and recreation, not a business. As to hunting, the country\r\ngentlemen occasionally engage in it, but surely there is nothing\r\ncriminal in this! From my education and other pursuits I have seldom\r\nparticipated in it myself; but I consider it, above all exercises, the\r\nmost manly and healthful.\r\n\r\nBut come, let us dismiss the gentlemen and their amusements, and take\r\nup the female part of the community.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Carolina, I confess, are not generally as handsome as\r\nthose of the northern states; they want that bloom which, in the\r\nopinion of some, is so indispensable an ingredient in beauty; but\r\ntheir paleness gives them an appearance of delicacy and languor which\r\nis highly interesting. Their education is perhaps more attended to\r\nthan anywhere else in the United States; many of them are well\r\ninformed, all of them accomplished. For it would be far more\r\nunpardonable in a girl to enter a room or go through a congo\r\nungracefully, than to be ignorant of the most common event in history\r\nor the first principles of arithmetic. They are perfectly easy and\r\nagreeable in their manners, and remarkably fond of company; no\r\nCharleston belle ever felt \"ennui\" in her life. In the richness of\r\ntheir dress and the splendour of their equipages they are unrivalled.\r\nFrom their early introduction into company, and their constant and\r\nunreserved intercourse with the other sex, they generally marry young;\r\nand if their husbands want only companions for the theatre or the\r\nconcert-room, or some one to talk over the scandal of the day with\r\nwhen at home, they make tolerable wives. As we have now brought them\r\nto the \"ne plus ultra\" of human happiness, marriage, we will leave\r\nthem there, and so finish our description.\r\n\r\nThe reason of your not hearing from me so long after your return to\r\nNew-York was this: not knowing till you wrote me from Ballston how my\r\nletters would be received, I was really afraid to venture writing.\r\n\r\nYou ask how Miss P. walks? If it is your object, as you say, from\r\nknowing bow you stand with her in point of forces, to preserve better\r\nwhat you have won, receive a general lesson. \"Continue in every\r\nrespect exactly as you are, and you please me most.\"\r\n\r\nYou wish me to acquire French. I already understand something of it,\r\nand, with a little practice, would soon speak it. I promise you,\r\ntherefore, if you become my instructress, in less than two months\r\nafter our marriage to converse with you entirely in that language. I\r\nfix the period _after_ our marriage, for I cannot think of being\r\ncorrected in the mistakes I may make by any other person than my wife.\r\nSuppose, till then, you return to your Latin, and prepare to use that\r\ntongue with me, since you are averse to one understood by all the\r\ncanaille. Adieu. I have literally given you a folio volume.\r\n\r\nYours, my dear Theodosia,\r\n\r\nJOS. ALSTON.\r\n\r\nP. S. The arrangement you speak of proposing in your letter for an\r\ninterview has determined me. I shall there fore sail certainly in a\r\nfew days. Winds be propitious!\r\n\r\nMiss BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, 1799, the federal party were triumphant in the State of\r\nNew-York. The city was entitled to thirteen members of Assembly. They\r\nwere federalists, and were elected by an average majority of 944; the\r\nwhole number of votes being about 6000. Colonel Burr during this year\r\nwas not in public life, but he was not an idle spectator of passing\r\nevents. The year following a President of the United States was to be\r\nelected. It was now certain, that unless the vote of the State of\r\nNew-York could be obtained for Mr. Jefferson, he could not be elected.\r\nIt was equally certain, that unless the city could be carried by the\r\ndemocratic party, the state would remain in the bands of the\r\nfederalists.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1799 and the spring of 1800, Colonel Burr\r\ncommenced a system of party organization for the approaching contest.\r\nThe presidential electors were at that time chosen by the legislature,\r\nmeeting in joint ballot. His first object was to secure such a\r\ncommittee of nomination for the city and county of New-York as, in the\r\nselection of candidates for the assembly, would be influenced by his\r\nrecommendation. His opinion, often expressed to his confidential\r\nfriends during the winter of 1800, was, that without a most powerful\r\nticket there was no prospect of success; with such a ticket and proper\r\nexertions it could be elected. He entertained no doubt (and the result\r\nproved that he was correct), that on the city and county of New-York\r\nwere suspended the destinies of the country, whether for good or\r\nwhether for ill. These views and these opinions were presented and\r\nenforced by him for days, and weeks, and months previous to the\r\nelection upon all the young and ardent politicians of the city with\r\nwhom he had any intercourse. The effect of which was, that when the\r\ncrisis arrived, every member of the party seemed to feel the great\r\nresponsibility which rested upon him.\r\n\r\nThe next object with Colonel Burr was to inculcate harmony in the\r\nparty and concert in action. It was known that a most unconquerable\r\njealousy existed between the Clinton and Livingston families and the\r\nadherents of those factions. The Clintons and their supporters were\r\nanti-federalists. The Livingstons were not less distinguished as\r\nfederalists, until some time after the organization of the general\r\ngovernment under the new constitution. Colonel Burr enforced, in mild\r\nand persuasive terms, the necessity of sacrificing all prejudices and\r\npartialities; of surrendering all personal and ambitious\r\nconsiderations; of standing shoulder to shoulder, and uniting in one\r\ngreat effort to rescue the country from misrule. By the most unceasing\r\nperseverance he succeeded in both these objects.\r\n\r\nEvery section of the democratic party felt the necessity of Colonel\r\nBurr's being a member of the legislature that was to choose the\r\nelectors; but a difficulty arose. It was understood that General\r\nHamilton would personally attend the several polls during the three\r\ndays of election; that he would counsel and advise with his political\r\nfriends, and that he would address the people. Here again all seemed\r\nto feel that Colonel Burr was the man, and perhaps the only man, to\r\nmeet General Hamilton on such an occasion. But if his name was on the\r\nAssembly ticket as a candidate, his personal exertions during the\r\nelection would be lost to the party. To place him in that situation\r\nappeared to many like abandoning the field without a struggle to the\r\nfederalists. In this dilemma, the county of Orange patriotically came\r\nforward and nominated him as a candidate on their Assembly ticket,\r\nthus leaving him free to act in the city of New-York; and by the\r\npeople of Orange Colonel Burr was elected a member of the legislature.\r\n\r\nAll the details connected with the formation of the Assembly ticket in\r\nApril, 1800, for the city and county of New-York, will be given\r\nhereafter. The result is known. It succeeded. The legislature was\r\ndemocratic. Presidential electors of the democratic party were\r\nappointed. Colonel Burr's services were appreciated by the democracy\r\nin every section of the country, and he was nominated on the ticket\r\nwith Mr. Jefferson for the offices of President and Vice President of\r\nthe United States. By the constitution, as it was originally adopted,\r\nthe person who had the greatest number of votes, provided they were a\r\nmajority of the whole number given, was president; and the person\r\nhaving the next highest number, with the like proviso, was\r\nvice-president. When the ballots were examined, it appeared that Mr.\r\nJefferson and Colonel Burr were the two highest candidates, and that\r\ntheir votes were equal. By the provisions of the constitution, it\r\ndevolved upon the House of Representatives of the United States,\r\nvoting by states, to designate which of these gentlemen should be\r\npresident, and which vice-president.\r\n\r\nOn proceeding to the ballot a contest ensued, which lasted for several\r\ndays, producing the most implacable and bitter animosities; a contest\r\nwhich terminated in the election of Mr. Jefferson and the ruin of\r\nColonel Burr. Until within a few years that scene has been completely\r\nenveloped in mystery. A part of the incidents connected with it,\r\nhowever, in a fugitive form, are before the world. But the period has\r\narrived when the question should be met with manly firmness; when the\r\nvoice of history should announce to posterity the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so far as it can be ascertained. The\r\ngeneration which were the actors in those scenes have passed away. The\r\nparties immediately interested are sleeping the sleep of death. Few,\r\nvery few indeed now living, understand the nature of that contest. The\r\ncurtain shall be drawn aside. The documents which develop its\r\ncharacter, and which are scattered in fragments, will be brought\r\ntogether, and recorded (it is hoped) in a permanent and tangible form.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the immediate friends and advisers of Mr.\r\nJefferson, until within a few hours of the balloting, had no\r\nconfidence in certain leading and distinguished members of Congress,\r\nwhose names shall be given, but who, on his coming into power,\r\npromptly received the most substantial evidence of his kind feelings\r\nby appointments to office. The clearest evidence will be presented\r\nthat Mr. Jefferson entered into terms and conditions with the federal\r\nparty or some of their leaders; that the honourable James A. Bayard,\r\nof Delaware, acted on the part of the federalists, and the honourable\r\nSamuel Smith, of Maryland, at present mayor of Baltimore, on the part\r\nof Mr. Jefferson; and that terms and conditions were agreed upon\r\nbetween them before Mr. Jefferson could be elected; while, on the\r\nother hand, it will be demonstrated that the charges which have been\r\nmade against Colonel Burr of having intrigued and negotiated with the\r\nfederal party to obtain the office of president were as unjust as they\r\nwere groundless. But \"_I come to bury Cesar, not to praise him_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Manuscript poem of my own.\r\n\r\n2. From the same.",
